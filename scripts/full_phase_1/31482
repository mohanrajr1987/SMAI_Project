Positive 31482 pIts a bit of a frustration that a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesuiguidelineswidgetdesign.htmlanatomy relnofollowas of Android 4.0, app widgets are automatically given margins between the widget frame and the appa p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comdtoVE.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdtoVE.png altStandard Widget Anatomyap  pThe space on a small phones screen is at a premium, and the margin can represent quite a large loss, particularly when the widget is small too.  Despite hours of looking, I cant see a way to override or control the widgets margins.  p  pHowever, I have been playing recently with the a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.teslacoilsw.launcheramphlen relnofollowNova launchera, and note that its possible to control widget margins using that launcher.  What is more, although theres a global widget margin setting something like None, Small, Medium, Large, this setting can be activated per widget.  p  pAnd its lovely to get widgets that extend from edge to edge.  See, for example, the following screenshot from a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.cloud3squared.meteogram relnofollowmy meteogram appap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comEZHnl.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEZHnl.png altenter image description hereap  pSo, the question is... how does the Nova launcher control widget margins, and can the same method be used at the widget level, or does the control necessarily come from launcher level so that there is no hope for ever controlling widget margins unless youre a launcher developerp

Negative 31482 pWhenever I try to access a NTLM authenticated intranet site, Safari takes forever to process and then comes back with The sever is unavailable or if allowed by the site, loads with out authenticating. I can access these same sites with no problems in both Firefox and Internet Explorer. The sites are hosted on IIS6 and are being generated with either ASP, ASP.Net 1.1 or ASP.Net 2.0.p  pAny insight on why Safari choking on these sites Are there any workarounds to get NTLM to correctly authenticate with Safarip  phr p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIn further playing with it I have determined that NTLM will work with the page loading reasonably fast if I am using the FQDN for the site i.e. a hrefhttpmysite relnofollowhttpmysitea doesnt work, but a hrefhttpmysite.domain.prv relnofollowhttpmysite.domain.prva will work. Unfortunately, this will not work due to other constraints on the project.p  pDoes anyone know why the FQDN would work but the shorter name will not Is this something that can be worked around or is it Sorry out of luck p  phr p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pAccording to the Wireshark packet sniffer, safari sends a SYN to the correct severs IP address. The intranet sever responds with a SYN, ACK, to which safari sends an ACK. This is the end in communication between safari and the sever. When attempting to access the intranet site by FQDN these three packets were the same but were then followed by a HTTP GET request, which then successfully loaded the page. p  pBecause Safari is connecting to the correct IP address, I find it hard to believe that Safari just doesnt support NetBIOSWINS names. Additionally, because the NTLM packets are never exchanged as safari never sends the initial GET request, Im certain that NTLM has nothing to do with this issue.p  pDoes anyone know the status of safaris support of NetBIOSWINSp

Negative 31482 pWe have an ASP.Net app, that behaves strangely under IIS6. The app itself is straightforward ASP.Net 2.0 Webforms deal, nothing too weird is going on in there there are couple HTTP Modules in the pipeline, but I wouldnt consider those weird  . The thing I dont understand is the page execution times, or, more specifically, the difference between the time reported by ASP.Net tracing trace.axd and observed by the client Fiddler.  When the app is run on developers box WinXP, IIS5.1, the times reported by ASP.Net and Fiddler are very closep  prePage exec time               0.0919834 Fiddler Total Sequence time  0.1560980 pre  pI can understand 60ms being spent getting 5KB worth of data from IIS to Fiddler both of which run on the same machine, BTW. Now, when we move the code to the server Win2k3, IIS6, the picture changes dramaticallyp  prePage exec time               0.1702014 Fiddler Total Sequence time  0.5156283 pre  pThis is same page, and Fiddler is again running on the same machine with the code. Why does it suddenly take 350ms to deliver the same 5KB p  pPS. On both machines the results are obtained by accessing the URL via the actual machines hostname, e.g. a hrefhttpmachinenameapppage.aspx relnofollowhttpmachinenameapppage.aspxa as opposed to a hrefhttplocalhostapppage.aspx relnofollowhttplocalhostapppage.aspxa. p  pPPS. Configurationwise, the setups of a dev box and the server are as close as we could make them  both use the exact same web.config. Both hit the DB sql server with integrated auth, and, consequently, the app runs under a domain account. The app uses forms authentication, and does NOT impersonate i.e. it always runs under the same account. Now, the way this works on IIS5 is different from IIS6  on IIS5 the account is specified in  tag in the machine.config, and on IIS6 its the AppPool setting. The setup seems pretty typical for both environments, and I cant imagine it causing 350ms delays...p
Negative 31482 pIm working on a web site where each user can have multiple rolespermissions such as basic logging in, ordering products, administrating other users, and so on. On top of this, there are stores, and each store can have multiple users administrating it. Each store also has its own set of permissions.p  pIve confused myself and am not sure how best to represent this in a db. Right now Im thinkingp  pusers roles usersroles stores storesusersp  pBut, should I also have storesroles and storesusersroles tables to keep track of separate permissions for the stores or should I keep the roles limited to a single roles table p  pI originally thought of having only a single roles table, but then what about users who have roles in multiple stores I.e., if a user is given a role of lets say store product updating there would need to be some method of determining which store this is referring to. A storesusersroles table could fix this by having a storeid field, thus a user could have store product updating and store product deletion for store 42 and only store product updating for store 84.p  pI hope Im making sense here. p  h2Edith2  pThanks for the info everyone.

Negative 31482 pLets say I have an codeNSArraycode of codeNSDictionariescode that is 10 elements long.  I want to create a second codeNSArraycode with the values for a single key on each dictionary.

Negative 31482 pSo, let me describe our current situation. We are a small team 6 of experienced Java developers, lost in a big IS team that is composed in majority with SAP and Siebel configurators.br  While all the other teams were currently using VSS, mostly as a vaulting system, our team had switch for Subversion after evaluating DVCS as well as it best fits our agile methodology.p  pNow, everyone is asked to move to ClearCase, and all the migration effort is put on the VSS users as they are the biggest part of users.br  As we are left on our own and dont know really ClearCase, we have some fear that it wont fit our current work process.p  pHere is currently how we are working on a daily basisp  ul liSVN repository follows the trunk, branches, tags structure.li liEach developer has its own sandbox in the repository, for testing and prototyping purpose.li liWe intensively use branches for new feature development, and are used to merge them together to do some integration testing before promoting them back to the trunk.li liWorking in Java, we are used to do refactoring, and Eclipse is a great help for that. A lot of classes and packages renaming is done everyday.li liDepending on how the projects evolved, some pieces may be reused, resulting in a split of a project in several project, the original remains integrated through the svnexternal property.li liWe use keyword substitution for some elements as its a extremely simple way to know for the tester what revision hes testing.li liOur Subversion repository is linked to Hudson for running test suites and promote valid builds by tagging them.li ul  pAll that I know about ClearCase for the moment is that well have to use it through CCRC or via its eclipse plugin version, and that it is highly encouraged that we linked most of our projects to a ClearQuest project for issue tracking management.p  pCould you enlighten us about how well ClearCase will substitute our Subversion, what concepts have an exact match I dont care about synonyms but really about concepts, and what kind of changes could you foreseen in the whole process.p  pThanks.p

Negative 31482 pI have two interfaces IDto1 and IDto2. IDto2 inherits IDto1. Both interfaces are for DTOs and so I wish to keep complex code out of their implementations  I do this by putting a single extension method emInitializeem in a static class for each interface.p  pSo I end up with the following types IDto1, IDto2, IDto1Extensions, IDto2Extensions.p  pI wish to have the emInitializeem extension method on both interfaces, but for each to have a different implementation.p  pIn client code I want to use code like thisp  precodedto as IDto1.Initialize codepre  p...and Id like the relevant extension method to be invoked based on the resolved type of the dto variable at runtime.p  pIs this possible in C and if not why notp  pstrongEditstrongp  pSorry, of course thisp  precodedto as IDto1.Initialize codepre  p...will invoke the emInitializeem method on the emIDto1em type. I meant that the emdtoem variable would be passed in as an argument to a method, under which circumstances I believe the method would be chosen polymorphically given the inheritance hierarchy I specified earlier.p  pThanks for all your answers.p
Negative 31482 pEdit  using SQL Server 2005.p  pI have a query that has to check whether rows from a legacy database have already been imported into a new database and imports them if they are not already there.  Since the legacy database was badly designed, there is no unique id for the rows from the legacy table so I have to use heuristics to decide whether the row has been imported.  I have no control over the legacy database.  The new database has slightly different structure and I have to check several values such as whether create dates match, group number match, etc. to heuristically decide whether the row exists in the new database or not.  Not very pretty, but the bad design of the legacy system it has to interface with leaves me little choice.p  pAnyhow the users of the system started throwing 10x to 100x more data at the system than I designed for, and now the query is running too slow.  Can you suggest a way to make it faster  Here is the code, with some redadacted for privacy or to simplify but I think I left the important partp  precodeINSERT INTO [...NewDatabase...] SELECT [...Bunch of columns...]   FROM  [...OldDatabase...] AS t1  WHERE t1.Printed  0   AND NOT EXISTSSELECT                     FROM [...New Database...] AS s3                   WHERE years3.dtDatePrinted  1850  This allows for reimporting rows marked for reprint                     AND CASTt1.[Group] AS int  CASTs3.vcGroupNum AS int                     AND RTRIMt1.Subgroup  s3.vcSubGroupNum                     AND RTRIMt1.SSN  s3.vcPrimarySSN                     AND RTRIMt1.FirstName  s3.vcFirstName                     AND RTRIMt1.LastName  s3.vcLastName                     AND t1.CaptureDate  s3.dtDateCreated codepre

Negative 31482 pIm working on an installer that, among other things, installs a web server. As part of the setup, Im setting up an ODBC driver and data source. Im trying to put a bunch of utility files, including the third party ODBC driver DLL, into a certain folder, but when I run the installer, it insists on changing that directory to the SystemFolder directory. Why is it doing this, and is there any way that I can make it install the files where I want them to go Strangely enough, it was actually working correctly up until I added a bunch more files to that particular folder. In case its relevant, the files that Im having trouble with are in a merge module.p  pIm temporarily getting around the problems that this is causing by installing the DLL to the SystemFolder, but Id much rather avoid DLL hell by having it installed where I want it to go, not where Windows Installer seems to think it should go.p  pI should also point out that Im using Wise Installation Studio 7.0 as my development environment.p

Negative 31482 pLets say that we have a Python script codedo.pycode and we want to be able to call it without extension, like codedocode or code.docode. p  pIf we rename the file from codedo.pycode to codedocode and assure we have a valid shebang line it will work for all platforms but Windows. On Windows there is no way of executing file without extension.p  pOn Windows, if we keep the original file extension well be able to call the script without the full name because the Python installer registers the code.pycode extension as an executable one.p  pIt looks that we need to deliver the same script under two different names in order to be call it on Windows and nonWindows environments. I really do not like this and Im looking for a solution without this redundancy.p  pAnother common approach on this is to add a codedo.cmdcode wrapper batch file that is calling the original codedo.pycode file. This has at least one major issue it does strongbreak the CtrlC  CtrlBreakstrong because there is no way to prevent codecmd.execode from prompting you with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1234571howcanisuppresstheterminatebatchjobincmdexestrongTerminate batch job YNstrong message.ap  pIf we are about to use a wrapper we need to be sure thatp  ul lireturn the errorcode errorlevel returned by the original scriptli liit will not change the environmentli liit will reuse the same console no new windowsli lidoesnt interfere with STDOUT, STDIN or STDERRli libe friendly with CtrlC no promptsli ul  pI suppose the optimal solution is still to use a wrapper.

We have reviewed your application and   have determined that it cannot be   posted to the App Store at this time   because it is not using a baseline   stream of 64 kbps for the HTTP Live   Streaming protocol to broadcast   streaming video. HTTP Live Streaming   is required when streaming video feeds   over the cellular network, in order to   have an optimal user experience and   utilize cellular best practices. This   protocol automatically determines   bandwidth available to users and   adjusts the bandwidth appropriately,   even as bandwidth streams change.    This allows you the flexibility to   have as many streams as you like, as   long as 64 kbps is set as the baseline   feed.p blockquote  pThis is what I have gotten from Apple, eventhough I have a 48kbps, 64kbps, 128kbps AND 384kbps stream available.

Negative 31482 pMacports is the only packaging system I have checked out on the Mac and I dont like it.it needs all its applications installed in a particular location. Thats probably the reason why it showed Python2.5 as a dependency which needs to be installed even though I already had it. For a person who has moved over from Ubuntu, I sorely miss aptget. As far as Macports are concerned, there is no central repository so the source of a package is fetched from the project website, built and installed. p  pNow, Ubuntu has various open source projects in a deb format which can be properly installed on ubuntu machines. Whats more, there is also a central repo for all these debs.p  pProblems with Macportsp  ol liIt installs stuff even if its already present on the machine.li liIt always downloads, compiles and installs packages from the project website. It does not have a central repository for all packages. I guess this could result in installing packages which are not mutually compatible. li ol  pNow assuming that Mac had a really good packaging system what would be the problems we facep  ol liServers for all the packages.li liAll the packages would have to be regularly maintained, newer packages would have to be packaged.li ol  pHowever, if there were some standard way to convert deb filesIm talking about deb files because I feel Ubuntu repositories are the best to packages which are installable in OSX  p  ol lipWe could use the standard Ubuntu repositories which have packages that are regularly maintained. pli lipWe have a central location for all the packages rather than downloading packages from the development websitelike Macports does.pli ol  pWould something like that be possible  If anyone has ideas for a better solution, do pitch in your comments. Its really sad that there isnt a really good package manager for Macs.p

Negative 31482 pI have a database with a bunch of reference tables like States, Languages, etc.. I would like to be able to cache these tables and then use those types in any ObjectContext I want.

Negative 31482 pI am currently writing a quick script in Ruby that goes through all the contents of two folders, and returns a list of all the files that are not in either of the two folders. Currently what I am doing is storing the paths of all the files of each directory in an arrayp  precodeFind.finddir1 do path   if File.filepath     directory1files ltlt path  Add path to an array of filepaths for the 1st directory.   end end  I repeat the process for the second directory and store their paths in an array called directory2files. codepre  pThe problem I am having is that when I try and subtract the two arrays larger array  small array  to get the remaining files, I get an empty array. Reason I get this is because the full paths are trying to be subtracted instead of just the basenames. Ex folder1file.txt  folder2file.txt  How can I find if a file with the same name is in two folders, and remove it from a list so the only files remaining are the ones not present in both foldersp

Negative 31482 pWe are working on SOA, both on client Silverlight and server WCF sides, but with possibility of the clients being implemented by 3rd parties .NET, Java, etc.. We use WSDLfirst approach and want our data and services interface classes C to be automatically generated from schemas during build process. So we need common data classes code not being regenerated for every service for successful compilation.p  pI have tried the strongsvcutilstrong utility, trying to first create all data contract classes from XSDs with the dataContractOnly switch, and compile them to separate class library  emthe first stageem. And then to create each service interface code, omitting the classes already in the library, with the reference switch  emthe second stageem.p  pThe problem is that our schemas do not meet the DataContractSerializer requirements, so svcutil cannot create data classes. Even after I used strongxsdstrong utility for this purpose, I cannot use svcutils reference switch on the second stage, since this switch only works for DataContract classes. And this is not the case with the classes generated by xsd utility.p  pSo, am I missing something with these tools and are there any way to use them in my situation, or are there any other tools to generate data classes and service interfaces from XSD and WSDL schemas, in case where common data types are used by several service interfaces Or should we hardly limit ourselves with DataContract compatible schemas What approach do you use for WSDLfirst developmentp

Negative 31482 pI am thinking of working on an online homework submission system where students can upload their text documents that can viewed by somebodyTeacherProfessor with viewing rights.

After the review is done, this document is sent back to the student with proper feedback. p  pThere are a lot of moving pieces here and I am having a tough time trying to figure out where to start.

This is the standard threetiered architecture that was described in the response. I need massive scalability and since the application will be primarily document centric and I may have to retrofit search at some later date, I would like to steer away from RDBMS. Since we have a massive amount of users posting their documents at any given timelets say .txt files for the time being, I would need some kind of message queue to process this massive information influx. There has to be some kind of a fast transformation layer that takes the documents in all its formats and displays it in a format suited for annotations and markup....and the list goes on. Starting with the Domain model and moving down would be ideal but I am a little bit of a skeptic.p

Negative 31482 pIm having yet another WPF binding issue.  Just when I think Ive got this stuff figured out, I run into more problems...  Sp  pAnyway... Ive created a custom user control for selecting files.  Its a simple textbox followed by a button contained within a grid.  The property of the control with which I am working is called FilePath and the TextBox on this control is bound to that property.  When the button is clicked, a SaveFileDialog is opened and the user selects a file.  The UI correctly updates after the user selects the file.p  pThe problem I seem to be having is that when I bind an object to the control in this instance I have an object with a DocumentFilePath property the object doesnt update when a new file is selected.p  pHeres the relevant code within my user controlp  precodepublic static readonly DependencyProperty FilePathProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterFilePath, typeofstring, typeofFileSave, new UIPropertyMetadatastring.Empty, OnFilePathChanged  public string FilePath      get              return this.GetValueFilePathProperty as string          set              this.SetValueFilePathProperty, value         this.OnPropertyChangedFilePath        private void OnPropertyChangedstring propName      if PropertyChanged  null             PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropName        private static void OnFilePathChangedobject sender, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e      FileSavesender.OnPropertyChangedFilePath  codepre  pAnd the user control is added into my Window programatically by using reflection on my objectp  precodeprivate void AddFileSavePropertyInfo pi       FileSave fs  new FileSave      Binding b  new Bindingpi.Name       fs.SetBindingFileSave.FilePathProperty, b      this.AddToGridfs adds the control into my windows grid in the correct row and column nothing fancy here  codepre  pIt may be worth noting that if I load the window with an existing object, my user control displays properly but still wont register any changes within the object to which it is bound.p  pPlease let me know if you guys need any more info.p  pThanks in advance,br  Sonnyp  pstrongEDITstrong  Ive found a way around the problem, but this probably isnt a good solution.  By watching the debugger carefully I found that when I set the FilePath property within my control, the object was being unbound.

Negative 31482 pFrom time to time I encounter with a strange MySQL behavior. Assume I have indexes type, rel, created, type, rel. The best choice for a query like this onep  precodeSELECT id FROM tbl WHERE rel  3 AND type  3 ORDER BY created codepre  pwould be to use index codetype, rel, createdcode. But what MySQL does Surprisingly, it decides to intersect indexes codetypecode and coderelcode, and that leads to worse perfomance. Here is an examplep  precodemysqlgt EXPLAIN     gt SELECT id FROM tbl     gt WHERE rel  3 AND type  3     gt ORDER BY createdG  1. row             id 1   selecttype SIMPLE         table tbl          type indexmerge possiblekeys idxtype,idxrel,idxreltypecreated           key idxtype,idxrel       keylen 1,2           ref NULL          rows 4343         Extra Using intersectidxtype,idxrel Using where Using filesort codepre  pAnd the same query, but with a hint addedp  precodemysqlgt EXPLAIN     gt SELECT id FROM tbl USE INDEX idxtyperelcreated     gt WHERE rel  3 AND type  3     gt ORDER BY createdG  1. row             id 1   selecttype SIMPLE         table tbl          type ref possiblekeys idxtyperelcreated           key idxtyperelcreated       keylen 3           ref const,const          rows 8906         Extra Using where codepre  pI assume MySQL takes an execution plan which contains less number in the rows column of the EXPLAIN command. From that point of view, index intersection with 4343 rows looks really better than using my combined index with 8906 rows. So, maybe the problem is within those numbersp  precodemysqlgt SELECT COUNT FROM tbl WHERE type3 AND rel3   COUNT        3056   codepre  pFrom this I can conclude that MySQL is mistaken at calculating approximate number of rows for combined index.p  pSo, what can I do here to make MySQL take the right execution planp  pI can not use optimizer hints, because I have to stick to Django ORM The only solution I found yet is to remove those onefield indexes.p  pMySQL version is 5.1.49. p  pThe table structure isp  precodeCREATE TABLE tbl    id int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   type tinyint1 NOT NULL,   rel smallint2 NOT NULL,   created datetime NOT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY id,   KEY idxtype type,   KEY idxrel rel,   KEY idxtyperelcreated type,rel,created  ENGINEMyISAM codepre

Negative 31482 pI am looking for an example of a simple hashing algorithm that can be shown to be vulnerable to multiple preimage attacks for a specified input length. p  pFor example, if I know that the input data is exactly 160 bytes and generates a 16 byte hash, then there exists some method of finding other inputs that are 160 bytes in length and generate an identical 16 byte hash without resorting to pure brute forcing. p  pPlease note that I do not mean using something like MD5 or SHA1. I understand that these are designed to make this impractical. This algorithm would be a textbook example of the flawed design of a hashing algorithm and how that flaw can be practically exploited. I have tried Google, but much of what turns up is theoretical research on known, secure algorithms. p

Negative 31482 pBackground CamelBones registers Perl classes with the ObjectiveC runtime. To do this, every Perl method is registered with the same IMP function that function examines its codeselfcode amp codecmdcode arguments to find which Perl method to call.p  pThis has worked well enough for several years, for messages that were dispatched with codeobjcmsgSendcode. But now I want to add support for returning floatingpoint and large struct types from Perl methods. Floatingpoint isnt hard Ill simply write another IMP that returns double, to handle messages dispatched with codeobjcmsgSendfpretcode.p  pThe question is what to do about codeobjcmsgSendstretcode. Writing a separate codeIMPcode for every possible struct return type is impractical, for two reasons First, because even if I did so only for struct types that are known at compiletime, thats an absurd number of functions. And second, because were talking about a framework that can be linked against any arbitrary ObjectiveC amp Perl code, we emdontem know all the potential struct types when the framework is being compiled.p  pWhat I hope to do is write a single codeIMPcode that can handle any return type thats dispatched via codeobjcmsgSendstretcode. Could I write it as returning codevoidcode, and taking a pointer argument to a return buffer, like the old codeobjcmsgSendstretcode was declared Even if that happened to work for now, could I rely on it continuing to work in the futurep  pThanks for any advice  Ive been racking my brain on this one. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHeres the advice I received from one of Apples runtime engineers, on their objclanguage mailing listp  blockquote   pYou must write assembly code to handle   this case.p      pYour suggestion fails on some   architectures, where ABI for function   returning void with a pointer to a   struct as the first argument differs   from function returning a struct.   On i386, the struct address is popped   from the stack by the caller in one   case and by the callee in the other   case. Thats why the prototype for   codeobjcmsgSendstretcode was changed.p      pThe assembly code would capture the   struct return address, smuggle it into   nonstructreturn C function call   without disturbing the rest of the   parameters, and then do the right   ABIspecific cleanup on exit coderet 4code   on i386. Alternatively, the assembly   code can capture all of the   parameters. The forwarding machinery   does something like this. That code   might be in opensource CoreFoundation   if you want to see what the techniques   look like.p blockquote  pIll leave this question open, in case someone brainstorms a better idea, but with this coming directly from Apples own runtime wrangler, I figure its probably as authoritative an answer as Im likely to get. Time to dust off the x86 reference manuals and knock the rust off my assemblerfu, I guess...p

Negative 31482 pI know this question was asked before, but before marking it as a duplicate, I want to tell you that my situation is a little different from what I found on the internet.p  pIm building and embedded script that people can put it on their sites.

It can be in cssjavascript jQuery.p  pThanksp

Negative 31482 pIm developing an Android app that absolutely needs to support Android 2.1 devices, including tablets and phones.p  pThe tricky part is I want to be able to provide roughly the same user experience on Android 2.x tablets as on bone fide Honeycomb tablets. Im planning on using the Compatibility package so that Fragment support is always available, but...p  pThe problem Ive got at the moment is Ive bought a Hannstab for testing, and discovered that it reports to apps that it has a large screen, despite actually being 10.1 inches. This would technically make it xlarge, but of course that category was not included in Android 2.2 which it runs, hence its large. I originally intended to just use resource qualifiers and treat all xlarge devices as tablets, and everything else as phones but now I realise I cant do that.p  pWould it be so bad to treat all xlarge strongandstrong large screened devices as tablets This would include Dell Streaks and other 5 to 7 inch screen devices as I understand it.p  pIs there a better alternative I havent really got my head around fragments properly yet so a fragmentsbased solution might be obvious to someone who has.p  pIve noticed that typically, apps I install on my Hannspad use their normal phone UI, with the exception of Evernote which uses a specific tablet interface  I wish I knew how theyd done that.p  pThe new Smallest Width resource qualifier introduced in Android 3.2 would solve this problem by doing away with the generalised screen size buckets altogether. Presumably I could copy this approach by writing code to work out the screen width in dp and then adding fragments to the activity as appropriate. Is that wise Id rather avoid that kind of work if its going to be a pain.p  pCheersp

Negative 31482 pI have implemented a sortable table that lets you sort tbody rows around using JQuery UI Sortable. Now the client also wishes to be able to just sort the rows using the row headers like I do with other tables using Wijmo Grid. If I enable Wijmo grid I appear to lose the ability to use sortable on the tbody.p  pSo for example sort by price ascending on one column in the table, however for some reason the user wants to manually move a more expensive option to the top so they then drag that to the top of the list.

With this configuration, we dont seem to be receiving UDP data sent to our machine from a peer on the wireless adhoc network.p  pIn contrast, we ARE able to send UDP to that same peer.  So its figuring out how to get traffic to the wireless adhoc peer, but traffic coming from the peer isnt getting to our socket.p  pMy suspicion is that its because the machine is multihomed.  My first thought was to make sure were binding a UDP socket on all network interfaces.  However, I checked the CSocketCreate documentation and it indicates that if you use the default value of NULL for the third argument lpszSocketAddress that it will listen on all network interfaces.p  pSo now Im stumped.

Negative 31482 pI am working on a Java web application which is now in the final stages of development and one of the remaining things to be done is the localization. We are using properties files  for every supported locale.  The issue I have spotted is that some unicode characters do no appear correctly in the web browser. The web pages have UTF8 encoding specified in the charset meta tag and the browser has correctly detected it In Firefox ViewCharacter Encoding the correct one seems to be selected. I believe the issue comes from the fact that while the application displays text as UTF8, the properties files are saved in ISOxxxx encoding, which happens to be some eclipse default setting.p  pI have found a similar question here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions863838problemwithjavapropertiesutf8encodingineclipseProblem with Java properties utf8 encoding in Eclipsea which advices me to install the Resource Bundle Plugin. I installed and used the plugin to edit the corresponding properties, but I still have the issue.p  pIs there a quick solution I mean a solution that will not cause too much changes in the application, since it is in almost finished stage that will overcome the problem I am experiencing. p  pMaybe I should mention that I am developing and observing the problem under Ubuntu Linux OS using Firefox 7.  Thanks in advance.p  pEdit I did not mention an important matter. My user interface is written in GWT and the properties are exposed by an interface which has annotations on the getters that GWT uses to internally create an implementation of that interface and link to the corresponding property. So I guess I do not have much control on how properties are actually being read, or at least I do not know how to do it in GWT.p

Negative 31482 pIve started learning about image processing in Matlab and I have a small problem.p  pIm trying to visualize FFT of images. The function imshow does what I need, when I supply the empty matrix e.g. sintax imshowimage, [] .p  pNow, the imshow does a good job because when supplied with the empty matrix, it will display the lowest value in the picture as black, the highest as white and will adjust all the other values accordingly. at least that is how I understood it.p  pThe scaling that imshow does is great and I was wondering if there is a Matlab function that would take an image and perform that kind of scaling I thought of saving the pictures manually after using imshow, but I would like to do this programatically.p  pI assume there is a nice Matlab feature that does this, but after googling around, I couldnt find any solutions. p

Negative 31482 pThrough consuming the a hrefhttpwww.salesforce.comusdeveloperdocsapiContentsforceapipartner.htm relnofollowSalesforce.com Partner WSDLa, Im working on a synchronization between an external system and Salesforce.com. As you would probably expect, the objects that dont exist by default in Salesforce.com are being created as custom objects via the GUI. While Ive had no problem porting over basic fields, Ive had some problems with the relationships.p  pSome of the external systems relationships are defined by foreign keys which are polymorphic as in, they can store the identifier for two or more different types.

Negative 31482 pI have a very specific data format and querying need, and I need to know the suitability of NoSQL DBs to this need. I am strongnotstrong asking which DB is best. I am interested in strongcapabilitiesstrong.p  pI need to store data in EAV style. Document stores with sparse indexes are perfect for this. This way I can create an index against each parameter on its values. When querying, only the needed indexes will be touched. MongoDB, for example, is perfect for this. emThis is need 1.emp  pThe query is in two stages. The first is a simple equivalent of WHERE and involves a series of lt operations against real numbers. The results could be in the tens of thousands of records, but typically would be in the thousands. emThis is need 2.emp  pThe second stage involves heavy mathematics that I have to perform on the stage 1 results in order to rank them. This math involves heavy use of powers and simpler operations. The results are then sorted by rank, and the top 100 returned to the client. emThis is need 3.emp  pMongoDB is the only NoSQL DB Im relatively familiar with, so Ill use it as a reference. I dont believe it can perform math in queries, and even if it could, it will likely be slow. I believe the math needs to be performed on the client in C or CUDA. This means that the data needs to be transfered very rapidly from DB to client. I know MongoDB has a native binary connection, but, for e.g., Couchbase uses REST, which I believe will make it slower at data transfer of large datasets.p  pThe reason I havent settled on MongoDB is that I need distributed servers, which, for e.g., Couchbase seems better suited for.p  pSo I need a solution that emcan either perform fast math internally, thus limiting the number of records to be transfered, or that can transfer records very rapidly so that they may be processed on the client.em I do understand the only way to know is to test, but what I dont know, hence this question, is which NoSQL DBs have the mentioned capabilities.p

Negative 31482 pI am sure that the answer to this has been posted before. Forgive me as I think I am just not thinking of the right search string. p  pWhat I have is a context menu strip assigned to my tray icon for my dialer. The idea is for the user to set various numbers and select the user defined numbers from the menu and initiate the dial. p  pSo the menu pops up with codePresetscode, codeSetupcode, amp codeExitcode. I want the Presets menu to open a new tree listing the user defined number. I also want this to populate from an xml file every time the application is loaded. p  pMy problem is that I have no idea how to dynamically populate a sub menu item and give it a function.p  pSo how would I at start up add user defined numbers to preset  codeuserNumber1, usernumber2, userNumber3code and then call the codedialcode function when clickedp  hr  pSo I found how to add to the list... I now feel silly for asking that. For anyone else who wants to know that one, The list item is given a name. Im my case the name attribute is  presetsToolStripMenuItemp  pSo to add an item to it call the name p  precodepresetsToolStripMenuItem.DropDownItems.Addstring text codepre  pNo to move on. I am stuck now trying to figure out how to assign an event to that newly added function. I did findp  precodepresetsToolStripMenuItem.DropDownItems.Addstring text, image, eventargs codepre  pI am struggling with this one. Maybe I need to stop and come back to it later. Perhaps if someone could provide me with an example of using this line to call a codefunctioncode I would be most appreciative.  p
Negative 31482 pI have a project which I have created in Xcode starting with the commandline tool template and I need to create a standard .app application bundle so I can use that to create the installer with PackageMaker.p  pCurrently the only thing listed under Products is the main binary, and when I try to create an archive I get a nonstandard directory structure ..usrlocalbin... instead of ..ContentsMacOS.p  pI also noticed under Packaging that Wrapper Extension is set to blank rather than .app. p  pI think my project is not configured to create an application bundle, however from what I read online Xcode is supposed to automatically create an application bundle when you use one of the standard templates.

Negative 31482 pIm a C programming who was tapped to write a small application in Visual Basic.  The application hosts an IronPython runtime and I am attempting to define some function in python and then call them from VB. I have written a simple test function in python p  precodedef test      print Test was Called codepre  pThen I use the iron python to create a ScriptSource from the python file.  I am able to look up the test variable through object operations but I can not figure out how to call the object that.  For example in VBp  precodepyScope  engine.CreateScope pySource  engine.CreateSourceFromFileCSomeFilepathtest.py pySource.ExecutepyScope  Now I expect the function test to be defined in pyScope Dim tmp as Object pyScope.TryGetVariabletest, tmp codepre  pAt this point in my code tmp is defined as an object of type PythonFunction.  I cant figure out how to call this function.  p  precodetmp codepre  pIs not valid VB syntax.  Ive gotten this far, now how do I perform this seemingly simple taskp  pEdit By calling p  precode pyEngine.Operations.Invoketmp codepre  pI am able to call the function and I see the expected output at stdout.  I am still under the impression that there is some functionpointerlike type that I can cast objects of type PythonFunction to which will let me invoke temp directly without calling to the Python engine. p
Negative 31482 pBasically what I have is a text file file.txt, which contains lines of numbers lines arent necessarily the same length e.g.p  pbr1 2 3 4  br5 6 7 8 br9 10 11 12 13p  pWhat I need to do is write new files with each of these numbers deleted, one at a time, with replacement e.g. the first new file will containp  pbr2 3 4           lt 1st element removed br5 6 7 8 br9 10 11 12 13p  pand the 7th file will containp  pbr 1 2 3 4 br 5 6 8          lt 7th element removed here br 9 10 11 12 13p  pTo generate these, Im looping through each line, and then each element in each line.

Negative 31482 pI have a codeltdivgtcode on my page with a fixed height, and codeoverflowy scrollcode set so that the content will scroll when it passes the bottom edge of the codeltdivgtcode. Nothing out of the ordinary.p  pFor some bizarre reason, the mouse wheel will only scroll the content if the cursor is over emempty spaceem in the codeltdivgtcode or if its over the scrollbar itself. If the cursor happens to be over any of the text content in the codeltdivgtcode, the mouse wheel wont do anything.p  pThis happens in both Firefox and Chrome, so it isnt just a quirk of a particular rendering engine or something.p  pThe codeltdivgtcode in question is overlaid on top of another via codeposition absolutecode, so Im assuming that somehow the codeltdivgtcode behind it is interfering with the mouse wheel event  but then youd think the problem would be reversed the codeltdivgtcode would scroll emwhenem the cursor was over the text, not over the empty space.p  pAnyone else ever see anything like this before Im stumpedp

Negative 31482 pIn my initial stab at creating a MVC4 Web API. Ive noticed a few things about the way routes are handled that seems a little offp  ul liControllers no longer ever have more than 4 actionsli liA resource that only supports one HTTP verb still gets its very own controllerli liThe route hierarchy tends to be very flat, ORli liAn extremely large number of routes must be specifiedmaintained compared to MVC apps for humans.li ul  pIve created fairly large sites that use only two or three routes, but Im just starting on my API and Im up to almost a dozen. I guess APIs by their nature lend themselves to deeper URLs than websites, but this seems a little excessive.p  pI feel like Im missing a namespace somewhere or a routing convention. I attribute nearly all of this to the fact that action names are no longer part of the route, just the HTTP method.

Negative 31482 pI am currently building a hub page for my application.  This page is designed to have multiple columns, each with a header and a gridview below.  However, each column gridview is populated with a different set of data from my view model.  I am successfully populating the grid views, but what im seeing is that the horizontal scrolling does not work so I can never view all of the information on the hub page.  Basically, users cant horizontally pan.p  pIs working with grouped data gridview the only way to achieve thisp  pI should also say that I tried using a Scrollviewer, but it seemed to scrunch up my gridviews, where it only showed my data in one column per gridview. p  pPlease see below at my current XAML code.

Negative 31482 pI am trying to create an applet that draws a christmas tree, then using buttons the user is able to draw decorations to the tree a different button for each decoration.p  pI had it so that it would draw a circle on the tree but this circle would disappear when a new one was drawn. It was suggested to me that the decorations need to be defined as objects with variable e.g. mouse click coordinates and then each time the mouse is clicked a new instance is added to an array of objects.p  pFirstly Im trying to create the decoration or ball object and draw this to the screen, once Ive done this Ill work on adding it to an array, so far it draws the ball but in the top left corner and mouse clicks have no effect. p  pAny help or hints would be greatly appreciated, its starting to do my head in a bit now Here is the code so far.

I wrote a program that apparently works for the cases that I tried but apparently gives incorrect answers for some edge cases that I do not have access to.

I fixed this by adding codeself.scrollView.contentOffset  CGPointZerocode at the beginning of the codeplayMoviecode to tell the scrollView to move to the top so there would be nothing above it to have to scroll back to.  I assume that adding some sort of ifstatement to the code in codeviewDidAppearcode that would keep scrollView.contentSize from reexecuting might fix the problem of not being able to scroll back up, however I like the cleanness of it starting back at the top.p  pOne last issue though.

How can I fix this As the time in the dataframe is the correct time no need for 1 hour. I know I can just create a new column where it is time 1 hour but it seems that ggplot2 should just plot it at the right time from the start.p  pThanksp  pthe code with some random datap  precodelibrarylubridate libraryggplot2 ee  read.tabletextConnectionTimestamp Temp.Diff   5142011 1900 0.385   5142011 1910 0.535   5142011 1920 0.484   5142011 1930 0.409   5142011 1940 0.385   5142011 1950 0.215, headerTRUE eeTimestamp lt mdyhmeeTimestamp ggplotdataee, aesxTimestamp, yTemp.Diff  geompoint codepre  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comsBOIX.png altplot showing added hourp

Negative 31482 pI was wondering if its possible to use in native code the libraries of the Android system that are not directly exposed as an API from NDK. In particular how to include them in my native app code so that they can be linked with it. I know that it is discouraged, but the compatibility of my project across different Android releases is not a concern.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is to skip some of the services that Android provides and try to sit closer to the kernel. Thanks.p
Negative 31482 pIve recently been confronted with the need to design a database. Since this is my first time, I thought Id better ask for some advice to make sure Im building on solid foundations.p  pstrongGoalstrongp  pId like to store objects POD structures best thought of as multimaps in an SQL database for storage and querying. The objects contents as well as its structure are continuously modified. The database will be accessed intensively through both queries and updates.p  pstrongUse Casestrongp  pFirst, each object should have a unique identifier.p  pSecond, different type of objects exist. For example, ObjectA is an instance of ClassA. ClassA can have attributes A1, A2, A3, etc. As a result, ObjectA can but isnt required, NULL is allowed have values for these attributes. However, each of these attributes may have more than one value, ie codeObjectA.A1foocode and  codeObjectA.A1barcode are both possible. The number of attributes of ClassA can change. For simplicitys sake, attributes can only be added, not removed.p  pThird, attributes are not specific to one class, ie objects of ClassB can also have attributes A1, A2, etc. Thus codeObjectB.A1foocode is also possible. Im not sure whether this changes anything, but I have a feeling it might in a design where each attribute corresponds with a table.p  pFinally, the following pseudoqueries and actions must be supportedp  ul liGet all the objects of type ClassA with attribute A1 equal to bar.li liGet all the attributes of ObjectB.li liAdd an attribute A4 to objects of type ClassA.li liAdd an object of type ClassC which has attributes A1foobar, A2bar.li ul  pstrongLimitationsstrongp  pFirst, I want to avoid serializing the data, so multiple values in a single column are out of the question. The database should be normalized and the data structures should be atomic. The database will be queried very frequently, so I cannot afford wasting time trying to implement a complex query mechanism. I will end up reinventing the wheel probably a square one as well.p  pSecond, I cannot use any prior knowledge of an objects internal structure as this will only become available at runtime. For example, in the use case above, the attributes are not known beforehand. So while I have thought of having a design where each attribute is a table, I cannot figure out how to get all the attributes of an object in such a setup.p  pstrongEnvironmentstrongp  pIm using SQLite 3.7, C.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat would be an appropriate, flexible database design that meets the requirements of the described problemp  pAny help, pointers or tips leading to useful insights or a solid design are very welcome.p  pThanksp  pps I have only basic theoretical familiarity and limited practical experience with relational databases, certainly no prior professional experience. I have been reading up on the subject the past week and have grasped some of the concepts which I think will be relevant to my case normalization, foreign keys, etc, but Im still going through my book at this moment.p

Negative 31482 pI upgraded to Savon v2.0.2 from 1.1.0 and it broke my app.  I made the necessary adjustments to the code to account for the changes in the Error callbacks SavonSOAPFault to SavonSOAPFault, SavonHTTPError to SavonHTTPError, etc and using the call vs the request method.

Negative 31482 pI dont know the name of this functionality, so I think its better to use an example imagine you have an object codeplayercode with a codegetScorecode method.p  pIf you type codeplayer.scocode, it will present you the attributes and methods that start with sco, and not the codegetScorecode method. Ive been using MonoDevelop for a while and it displays any option that has an occurrence of the string you typed, so codegetScorecode would be there. Is it possible to set eclipse to do the samep
Negative 31482 pI have a Vaadin application and Im implementing some asynchronous background processing. As far as I know, all requests from the client are processed by one of the threads from the Tomcats thread pool and after a request is processed the response the updated applications state is returned to the client and rendered.p  pBecause I have some tasks I want to perform in background, I need to display a Loading... label in the main HTTP thread, and after its displayed I need to start a background Thread which performs the task and when it finishes, the applications state is pushed to the client using ICEPush addon.p  pThe problem is that it seems to me that sometimes the background thread finishes BEFORE the main HTTP thread returns the respons to the client, therefore no Loading... label is displayed and sometimes the applications state is not fully updated on the client because of that. Therefore I need to start the background thread AFTER the main HTTP thread returns the response.p  pIs there a way to do that Or am I completely wrong about this approachp  pThanksp
Negative 31482 pstrongQuick Backgroundstrong Ive finished mostly reading Mark Seemanns Depdendency Injection in .NET and am ready to become a DI ninja. Ive refactored my codebase to use constructor injection, wired up my objects using Windsor, and SUCCESSp  p... except not. My program originally displayed several forms throughout its lifetime, and this was originally accomplished by newing them all up as needed. However, now that Im a NIT ninjaintraining I know that new is evil and must be banished to the composition root.p  pstrongThe problemstrong My first endtoend use test involved displaying my main window to the user. This window can be closed and a new version can be brought up again later. This worked fine in the postDI codebase until it came time to display the form for a second time. crash. The form had already been disposed. In wiring up my DI container I told it to use the Forms class to implement a specific interface and as should be expected it gave that object a singleton lifetime.p  pstrongThe questionstrong So Im pretty sure the way to fix this is to not have a dependency on the interface that the form implemented, but rather have a dependency on a factory for that interface. This is where Im confused on how to proceed.p  pMy first thought is to create a factory with the same constructor signature as the form, store all of those dependencies, and then new up a form whenever one is asked for. However, this feels like poormans DI and Ive already gone through the hassle of registering all my stuff with the Windsor container. So that leads me to...p  pMy second thought was to instead create a factory that takes the DI container as a dependency and then just .Resolves what I need each time using the transient lifestyle this time. I suspect that Id hook into the .Closed event and release there following the RegisterResolveRelease pattern.p  pstrongThe real questionstrong I like the idea of my second thought, but for some reason it feels like a hack. I dont know if thats because it is and there is a better way or if my spideysenses just arent tuned for DI yet. So, bottom line, is the second thought a valid approach or is it a code smellp  pAlso, if I use this approach with something that doesnt provide a way to hook into a closed event then how should I design the release mechanism such that the factory remindsencourages me to release the object when done at some point Ill probably forget otherwise...p  pThanksp

Negative 31482 pIm currently working on a game which renders a textured sphere representing Earth and cubes representing player models which will be implemented later.p  pWhen a user clicks a point on the sphere, the cube is translated from the origin 0,0,0 which is also the center of the sphere to the point on the surface of the sphere.p  pThe problem is that I want the cube to rotate so as to sit with its base flat on the spheres surface as opposed to just translating the cube.p  pWhat the best way is to calculate the rotation matrices about each axis in order to achieve this effectp
Negative 31482 pSorry for the stupid question. The issue was resolved. The right question was that I wanted to send the database connections in the socket. Which actually realized that can not happen because the information between the socket is passed as messages. Again, I apologize for the stupid question.

Negative 31482 pI am Working on a SharePoint farm solution, where I have a control template that contains my User Control. I am using Knockout model to to capture all the information on the screen. Initially, when a new item is clicked, I am making the first call to My model to initialize the User Control and bind the control to the screen using ScriptManager RegisterStartupScript All values initially are empty except dates. now when a user fills out the values, my model captures all the changes, I have a function that takes the model, converts it to XMl and saves it in a hidden text box. but I am having trouble getting to that java script function from the control template code behind.

Negative 31482 pIve not really used access for a while and not too sure how best to proceed with this data modelp  pI have set of resource tables of differing type, eg Data, Literature, Contractors, etc. I also have a set of category tables such as Procedures, Topics, and Regions.p  pI need to create manytomany relationships between the various resources and the various categories so it is possible to view a resource record and see lists of the various categories to which the resource is allocated, and viceversa, that is to view all resources allocated to a specific category. p  pI realise that i could create lots of link tables, eg LnkDataProcs, LnkDataTopics, etc, however with perhaps 10 resource tables and 3 category tables i would wind up with 30odd link tables which seems wrong it may also be useful to query all resources from each category anyway so it would be good to have one link table for each category.p  pIve done this kind of thing before using SQL in custom DB client apps by using one link table with fields as follows CategoryTable, CategoryID, ResourceTable, ResourceID  So that the link table stores the table name as well as the foreign key.  p  pHowever im not too sure how to fit this kind of model into an access database, it would be nice to use the Access framework masterchild form objects rather than having to write loads of custom code to perform queries and populate forms.p  pAny ideas how to proceed, or even what this kind of relationship is calledp  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 31482 pI have a program which color codes a returned results set a certain way depending on what the results are.  Due to the length of time it takes to colorcode the results currently being done with Regex and RichTextBox.Select  .SelectionColor, I cut off colorcoding at 400 results.  At around that number it takes about 20 seconds, which is just about max time of what Id consider reasonable.p  pTo try an improve performance I rewrote the Regex part to use a codeParallel.ForEachcode loop to iterate through the codeMatchCollectioncode, but the time was about the same 1819 seconds vs 20  Is just not a job that lends itself to Parallel programming very well Should I try something different  Any advice is welcome.

On a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh855698.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh855698.aspxa it says the audio.start method Opens an audio data stream 16bit PCM format, sampled at 16 kHz and starts capturing audio data streamed out of a sensor. The problem is that i dont know how pcm data is represented and i dont know if the method returns pcm true values or not. Because using the sdk examples i get values like 200, 56, 17 and i think audio values are more like 3105 . So does anyone know how do i get the true PCM values Or am i doing something wrongp  pThanksp

Negative 31482 pId like to ask one general question about JavaFX implementation strategy. Lets say I already have a java project with many classes and objects that uses maybe swing as a GUI. Now I want to use JavaFX as GUI. I want to display those objects in nice JFX UI. But to use JavaFX and its binding and all that stuff, classes need to utilize JavaFX style properties. The question is what should I do with all those old classes and business objects I already have Do I need to rewrite at least those to be displayed to new JFX form But those objects are also used for other purposes like database and file persistence. It doesnt seem to be OK to use JFX properties on plain business objects. Should I wrap BOs in corresponding JFX brothers This idea remainds me ViewModel from .NET WPF MVVM pattern. Can somenone advice me whats the correct way how to deal with this Thank you.p

Negative 31482 pIm working for a client and just had to fix an issue caused by Collabion Charts I think made by FusionCharts.  Collabions extall.css file has some very generic selectors using tag names, grabbingfiltering base html elements.  Obviously this will style all elements on the page, not just the elements associated with the Collabion content.  If you dig into any of the charts HTML you see that there is a container div with ID chartPanelContainer.  My solution was to modify the css file so that it would filter only the elements mentioned above contained within ID chartPanelContainer.p  pExamplebr codetd      margin0 codep  pBecomesbr codechartPanelContainer td      margin0 codep  pIn my environment the css file could be found herebr CProgram FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft SharedWeb Server Extensions14TEMPLATELAYOUTSCollabionChartsextresourcescssextall.cssp

Negative 31482 pFirst, I have read and googled on this issue extensively using various combinations of the the search terms php pdo or mysql database name escape. Sadly, I have not found anyone dealing with this same issue.p  pI have a mysql database with a schema named codewww.company.comcodep  pGenerally this is not an issue, as it can easily be escaped using the back tick character.p  pHowever, when using mysqli or PDO to call a stored procedure in that schema, it always returns codePROCEDURE www.company.com.uspstoredprocedurename does not existcodep  pObviously, this is a simple mater of putting  characters around the codewww.company.comcode however I cannot find away to do this using either mysqli or PDO.

Furthermore, Ive already verified that this is not related to database user permissions.p  pHowever, every time I try to use the stored procedure through mysqli or PDO I receive the error above.p  pAs this procedure is responsible for ETL operations and returns multiple results sets, converting it to individual statements called from php would be very painful. I am desperately hoping that someone has dealt with this problem before.p  hr  pThe following are some of the methods tried Note backtick nesting seems to cause a mess w the forum, so Ive used the  character in place of a p  pIve tried using an escaped database name when calling to mysqliconnect... codemysqlimysqliconnecthost, thisgtdbgtusername, thisgtdbgtpassword, www.company.comcode ...and received an error.p  pIve tried calling the stored procedure wo a database name... codemysqligtmultiqueryCALL uspstoredprocedurename50, 20130501code ...and received the error referenced above.p  pIve tried calling the stored procedure w a database name... codemysqligtmultiqueryCALL www.company.com.uspstoredprocedurename50, 20130501code ...and received the error referenced above.p

Negative 31482 pstrongCan I use the Integrated Security a.k.a. Trusted Connection option in a connection string if Im connecting to a remote machine thats not on a domainstrongp  pI have a development server with Windows Server 2012 with WebSocket support, but I want to develop against the existing database on our main public server located in a remote virtual hosting environment.  Ive set up and established an encrypted VPN connection from the dev server to the main server, so Im able to manager the database remotely via SSMS and connect to it via .NETs System.Data.SqlClient classes, but Im currently doing so using an SQL Server account with a username and password.p  pNeither of the computers are on a domain, although the VPN simulates the connection occuring over a LAN.  So I was wondering if there was a way to add the devservers windows user account to SQL Server on the main system, so that I could connect with integrated security from the dev server.  Or does integrated security only work when connecting to the local database and a computer on the same domainp

Negative 31482 pI am in the process of going over my queries, and I have been reading articles about how you should use codeSQLNOCACHEcode in codeSELECTcode queries. This has confused me because every article in the end has a different conclusion on when to use this. One blog I have read said you should use this if you have identical queries, and are unique. On another blog I read that you should use it when you have to extract information that never changes.p  pCan someone explain to when is a good practice to use this I know its been asked before but reading a lot of articles didnt help, especially when people are saying to use this method in different situations. I made some theoretical situations, can someone tell me if its beneficial to use codeSQLNOCACHEcode. Thank you and I do apologize for a repeated question. Im just really confused.p  ol lipSay a website store its configuration i.e. site name, site description, keywords, and on every page a query request is made to extract this information as its required on every page.pli lipYou select a codeuserIDcode during a log in check, the query only runs during the log in check process.pli lipYou select some data from table codeacode in order to update a field in table codebcode, should you use codeSQLNOCACHEcode on the select for table codeacodepli ol  pThank you.p

For instance, there is no visible scrollbars on shoutbox in this screenshot, but you can still scroll by grabbing this white space and dragging it up and down like having an invisible scrollbar xd p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnYqTk.png altenter image description herep  pOn Firefox everything is fine, but on Chrome and OperaemWebkitem and emblinkem engine is not.p  pI dont know what possibly can make this, so Im searching for some solution.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p  pBest regards, Areen.p
Negative 31482 pIm currently have an issue in a project that Im writing. p  pPlease note Im not a C developer, Ive never worked in Visual Studio before. My brief forays into C have never been in windowsOSs, let alone CE.p  pS my issue is I open a project folder in embedded Visual C, and when I build the executable, for ARM I get 4 warnings that have to with signedunsigned mismatch that Im willing to ignore since this software has been in production for a decade without that issue cropping up.p  pBut when I build for x86 literally all I do is adjust my build target to Advantech UNO2059 form ADAM6500, I get 11 link errors that call adam6500crtl.obj, which I originally figured would be a library file but its a file that is generated during compiling I think. p

Negative 31482 pI am tasked with modularizing a C app that is a rewrite of a very large Delphi app the DB has 249 tables. Business constraints proscribe a complete redesign for .NET and better overall architecture, so we are basically just incrementally rewriting module for module of the Delphi app in C. Until finished, the suite will comprise a mixture of pending rewrites, and C app modules I want to integrate using MEF.p  pThe app concerns itself with TimeandAttendance and AccessControl, and has diverse business areas like Employee Leave and Visitors. I think these should be separate projects, where we can swap out a rewritten C project, and it will be imported into the MEF container. Each project will export an codeIBusinessAreacode, as a highest level definition, then these will export standard, shared interfaces like codeIServicecode, that introduce the services available in a business area, like codeCreateEmployeecode. Each service will be a class, in order to standardise the interface of the service with the container, and contain service metadata, such as a codeCommandcode for the service, data on who may use the service, etc.p  pAm I heading in the right direction, and if so, how do I store and expose codeIBusinessAreacode and codeIServicecode metadata as classes, versus legions of untyped metadata attributesp

Negative 31482 pIm running a site using bootstrap 2.3.2 and drupal 7. When the menu collapses below 980px, it drops down perfectly in every browser but safari. In safari the menu drops down, but below about 480px the links on it are either white or blank.

If you add certain attributes to the links using safaris equivalent to firebug, the information panel for example width100, they show up again. But if you set those properties in the css, or using javascript, it doesnt have any effect and they stay blank until you roll over them. If you use jquery to keep the menu open when the page loads .navcollapse.cssheight, auto, the links show up when you load the page but not if you collapse the menu and open it again. The problem also shows in more recent versions of safari on an iphone. p  pWould be awfully grateful if someone had an idea how to fix this.p

Negative 31482 pI have an interesting data structure design problem that is beyond my current expertise.  Im seeking data structure or algorithm answers about tackling this problem.p  pThe requirementsp  ul liStore a reasonable number of codepointer address, sizecode pairs effectively two numbers the first is useful as a sorting key in one locationli liIn a highly threaded application, many threads will look up values, to see if a specific pointer is within one of the codeaddress, sizecode pairs  that is, if the pair defines a memory range, if the pointer is within any range in the list.  Threads will much more rarely add or remove entries from this list.li listrongReading or searching for values must be as fast as possiblestrong, happening hundreds of thousands to millions of times a secondli liAdding or removing values, ie strongmutating the list, happens much more rarelystrong performance is not as importantli liIt is acceptable but not ideal for the list contents to be out of date, ie for a threads lookup code to not find an entry that should exist, so long as emat some pointem the entry will exist.li ul  pI am keen to avoid a naive implementation such as having a critical section to serialize access to a sorted list or tree.  What data structures or algorithms might be suitable for this taskp  hr  blockquote   pTagged with Delphi since I am using that language for   this task. Languageagnostic answers are very welcome.p      pHowever, I probably cannot use any of the standard   libraries in any language without a lot of care. The reason is that memory access   allocation, freeing, etc of objects and their internal memory, eg   tree nodes, etc is strictly controlled and emmustem go through my own   functions. My current code elsewhere in the same program uses   redblack trees and a bit trie, and Ive written these myself. Object   and node allocation runs through custom memory allocation routines.   Its beyond the scope of the question, but is mentioned here to avoid   an answer like use STL structure foo. Im keen for an algorithmic or   structure answer that, so long as I have the right references or textbooks,   I can implement myself.p blockquote

The entire page is loaded a second time and inserted in a new div just after the closing codeltulgtcode in the original markup. Looks like this is just done for the default tab.p  pIm thinking jQuery mobile is doing something weird with the way its initializing the tabs widget when the page containing it is loaded via AJAX vs a full browser page load. I just cant figure out why or what is causing itp  pstrongEditstrong Ive placed a bounty on this. I forgot to mention that Im using jQuery 1.11, and jQuery Mobile 1.4.1. The reason I have jQuery UI tagged is because jQuery Mobile apparently has taken the tabs widget directly from there, unaltered.p  pI log when codepageinitcode and codepageshowcode are called. When I click a link to the page containing the tabs, each event is fired twice, one at a time. The second codepageinitcode and codepageshowcode are executed from JS that was dynamically inserted into the page from jQM, and not from the original JS that loaded with the first app load. Whatever is happening here is causing the entire page to be reloaded and inserted into the DOM, with all the JS being executed a second time.p  pstrongEdit 2strong Note that this is happening without emanyem of my own custom JavaScript. Earlier I was just binding to pageinit and pageshow so I could log when they were fired, thats it. Also, the content within the tabs seems irrelevant as well. Just making the tab panes blank for instance does not fix it. p  pstrongEdit 3strong strikeHere is a link that demonstrates the problemstrike. Ive since removed the link that demos the problem, since it was hosted on my personal site and I confirmed it was a bug.p
Negative 31482 pHi Im writing a checkers engine and defining a canEatPoint1,Point2 method for player class which returns true or false based on if player can eat eat the piece at the specified points by checking if the pieces and landing path is on board, if the two pieces belong to the same player or not and also considering the kingsuper status of piece.p  pAnyways it works pretty pleasantly without recursion, but without recursion method must get points of the pieces instead of the landing piece which is okay if I manage the recursion. But I want the method to also consider if it gets the landing point instead of piece location. When I run the code it fixes the location and calls itself again there is no problem with that but. I get  NullPointerException on  caneat  Checker2.isAlive  true  false because Checker2 is null. My pointToChecker method returns null on this guy so Checker2 is null.

Negative 31482 pI understand that in OpenGL, we use the gluLookAt to place the camera relative to the world and thus define the image that would be drawn.p  pThe eye specifies the position of the camera and the center specifies the point the camera is pointing towards. Once we know these two, we can draw a straight line from the eye to the center. The camera plane would be normal to this line.p  pSince we know this plane, the up vector specifies the top of the camera  basically which direction in this plane is upwards. Thus the up vector is always orthogonal to the vector joining the center and the eye.p  pMy question is why do we need the full vector, when we just want to know the angle of rotation about the line joining center and eye. Is the reason behind this a computational advantage that I am not aware of And what if someone specifies a wrong up vector, which is not orthogonal to the direction of sightp

Negative 31482 pI was given a huge Microsoft Visual C 2003 project that generates an executable .exe where the project itself is depending on several DLLs. I noticed that even if the code managed to compile, when it runs it will look for the DLLs that it depends on say my program is called abc and the DLLs it depends on is called def.dll, and even if I add the path to include in the project settings, it will complain saying the DLL could not be found unless I add the folders containing def.dll to the PATH variable.p  pAs such, the final product is not one exe but one exe with tonnes of DLL.p  pIs it possible to have everything compiled to one single .exe file so that I can just take this executable with me and it would run on every single PC that I have The project itself is massive so I dont plan to change every single .h and .cpp file, but if there is a quick settings change in the visual C I think it would be nice. I know potentially the .exe would be 10 times as large and compiling it would probably take hours, but I think portability is rather important here.p  pThanksp  pPS NOT sure why people are voting down this post...can I no longer ask legitimate questions on StackOverflow I know the problem may sounds trivial to some of you guys, but I was really just simplifying the problem for the sake of illustration. p

Negative 31482 pstrongSummarystrong p  pIm looking to have a single MvvmCross solution for iOS and Android that implements FlyoutNavigationhamburger menusliding menu for the navigation.p  pstrongSample Codestrong p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.combenhysellV.FlyoutTest relnofollowhttpsgithub.combenhysellV.FlyoutTestap  pstrongProblemstrong p  pThe Android project works without issue, the iOS project is taking the Views and doubling the frame size.  Im not sure if its because of how Im using the codeFlyoutNavigationcode component on iOS, or something Im doing with using codeFlyoutNavigationcode in MvvmCross.  I played around with custom ViewPresenters without any luck.p  pstrongDetailed Problem Descriptionstrongp  pIve seen several solutions to implementing a FlyoutNavigationhamburger menusliding menu for MvvmCross, but none of the implementations address both Android and iOS in a unified solution.  Each method had their own Core project and then their own ideas on where to put the menu data, manage views, etc.  p  pThus I set out to create one unified architecture.   p  pSee a hrefhttpsgithub.combenhysellV.FlyoutTest relnofollowhttpsgithub.combenhysellV.FlyoutTesta for the working demo of a single solution with both iOS and Android projects that both implement a FlyoutNavigationhamburger menusliding menu.p  pI found and followed a hrefhttpmotzcod.espost60427389481effectivenavigationinxamarinandroidpart1 relnofollowhttpmotzcod.espost60427389481effectivenavigationinxamarinandroidpart1a, source a hrefhttpsgithub.comjamesmontemagnoXam.NavDrawer relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjamesmontemagnoXam.NavDrawera for the Android project, and it works great.  The Android project uses a native navigation drawer with fragments and swaps codeViewscode in and out nicely.p  pIn my solution using this architecture I have three main codeViewModelcodes...codeHomeViewModelcode, codeEnterTimeViewModelcode, and codeCreateNewJobViewModelcode.  codeHomeViewModelcode holds the sliding menu data, the other two provide the views the user would interact with.  In my example Im creating an hours entry application, thus a user can enter time against a job, or create a new job.p  pTo use my codeViewModelcodes in iOS I decided to use the codeFlyoutNavigationcode component, a hrefhttpsgithub.comClanceyFlyoutNavigation relnofollowhttpsgithub.comClanceyFlyoutNavigationa.  I attempted to use the linksprojects described in a hrefhttpslodge.blogspot.com201307awesomeslidingmenusfrombigfrank.html relnofollowhttpslodge.blogspot.com201307awesomeslidingmenusfrombigfrank.htmla, but was not successful augmenting their implementation with the already established .Core project that the Android project was dependent on.p  pI was able to quickly implement the codeFlyoutNavigationcode component in my codeHomeViewcode in iOS and I thought I was free and clear, but the codeViewscode themselves are 2x the size they should be on the device.  In the screen shots the titles of Enter Time and Create New Job should be centered, like any other title in MvvmCross, but are way off to the right.  See the three screen shots of Enter Time View, the menu open, and Create New Job View.  I used the Pause button for a quick and dirty hamburgerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comchYf3.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzTZM9.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLVdh8.png altenter image description herep  pIt feels like Im missing something simpleI need to implement a custom codeViewPresentercode for iOS, but my attempts to follow others have not been successful.

Negative 31482 pHere is the problem. After codevagrant upcode in an Ubuntu 12.04 box, I create a custom userp  precodesudo useradd m USERNAME codepre  pAnd I add it to the same groups than the codevagrantcode user. After that, I try to login with SSH but I cant find the way. I generate a SSH key pair with codesshkeygencode , and set the following option in the codeVagrantfilecodep  precodeconfig.ssh.username  USERNAME codepre  pSo doing codevagrant sshcode allows me to enter the user password and log in as that user, but not directly with a SSH key pair. I think that I have to set up the config variablep  precodeconfig.ssh.privatekeypath   codepre  pBut I dont know how... What path to set and where to place the public and private keys. It is probably a more conceptual problem with SSH than with Vagrant, but Ive been with this for hours, any hint Thanksp
Negative 31482 pOn a project Im working on, a number of checkboxes in a view are used to apply and remove a set of filters from a search result set. The values of these checkboxes are written to the query string to facilitate the ability to preload a filter state via navigation. To simplify, Ill pretend there is only one checkbox and ignore the fact that theres supposed to be some filtering.p  pTo ensure the state in the query string is correct, when a checkbox is checked, a function is called which writes the checkboxs value to the query string. The checkboxs value is bound to a scope property called checkBoxValue.p  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltinput ngmodelcheckBoxValue         ngchangeWriteValueToQueryString        typecheckboxgt codepre  pIn addition to this, when there is an update to the query string, I call a function which gets the current value from the query string and writes it to scope.checkBoxValue. It ensures that the value in my controller and the value in the query string are in sync with one another, regardless of where a change in value originates. The altogether simplified version of this all looks like thisp  pre classlangcoffeescript prettyprintoverridecodeapp  angular.module myApp, []  app.controller MyCtrl, [scope, location, scope, location gt      scope.GetValueFromQueryString   gt         queryStringValue  location.search[checkbox] or false         making sure I write a truefalse and not truefalse         scope.checkBoxValue  queryStringValue is true or queryStringValue is true      scope.WriteValueToQueryString   gt         location.search checkbox, scope.checkBoxValue.toString      scope.on locationChangeSuccess,  gt         scope.GetValueFromQueryString ] codepre  pWhen I check the box, it changes checkBoxValue, updates the value in the query string, and everything is just lovely. If I press the Back button in my browser, it notices that the location has changed, updates its value to match the query string efectively undoing my last, and everything is just lovely.p  p...Unless Im using Internet Explorer 10 or 11...p  pIn IE10 and IE11, the browser Back action doesnt strongappearstrong to do anything. In reality, it strongisstrong performing a browser Back action when I look at it, the query string reads as it should after a browser Back action. The problem seems to be that locationChangeSuccess never fires. The value is thus never retrieved from the query string, which means that my checkboxs actual value is never updated from the query string. Eventually, if you press Back enough, it just boots you off to whatever actual page you were on before you got to my own page, checkbox still in the state it was before you started hitting Back.p  pFunny thing is IE8 and IE9 have no problems with this.p  pstrongLink to CodePen try it in IE10 or IE11strong a hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpenzaGwt relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioanonpenzaGwtap  pThanks for reading my ramblings for this long.

Negative 31482 pIm trying to blit a surface created by codeIMGLoadcode SDLimage onto one created via codeSDLCreateRGBSurfacecode. When both surfaces are loaded with codeIMGLoadcode, this works fine, but not when the target surface was created using codeSDLCreateRGBSurfacecode.p  pBy experimentation, I figured out that if I call codeSDLSetAlphacode on the source surface, it suddenly works fine. The documentation is a bit lacking, but how I understand it, the way I call it below should clear the codeSDLSRCALPHAcode flag, presumably set by codeIMGLoadcode. It seems like the alpha flag of the emsourceem surface is what matters when blitting, so I guess this turns off alpha blending altogether.p  pThe big question is Why is this codeSDLSetAlphacode necessary in the first place And is this really the right way to do itp  pHeres code that reproduces thisp  precodeinclude ltSDLSDL.hgt include ltSDLimageSDLimage.hgt  SDLSurface copysurfaceSDLSurface source      SDLSurface target      target  SDLCreateRGBSurface0, sourcegtw, sourcegth,                                   sourcegtformatgtBitsPerPixel,                                   sourcegtformatgtRmask, sourcegtformatgtGmask,                                   sourcegtformatgtBmask, sourcegtformatgtAmask             I really dont understand why this is necessary.

Negative 31482 pI want to find a way to send all the geometry from an opengl framebuffer to a remote computer, who would do the rendering. This would allow me to have very complex simulations running on some kind of a big supercomputer, and rendered on a small mobile or simply cheap client machine doing the rendering.p  pBefore starting digging in my code, I though it would be relatively easy lets copy the vertex arrays and send it through the network, using boostserialisation for example, and thats it. But my geometry are encapsulated, which prevents me from accessing it from where I want to.p  pI have been able to render into a framebuffer instead of rendering directly on screen though, and I was wondering if there is a way to retrieve data from OpenGLs fbos in anywayp

Negative 31482 pAfter using an std vector to hold my move list for my chess engine, I realised that because chess has an averaging factor of 35 i.e. something like 35 legal moves from a typical position, the vector was resizing a lot, thereby negatively impacting the performance of the move generator. One way around this which I only realised today is by reserving a minimum capacity for the vector. However, the possibility of using alloca attracted my attention. This is probably a very simple question, but the documentation on alloca is pretty scarce, with very very few examples of how to use it.p  pSo an answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11578160allocationofvariablesizedclassAllocation of variablesized classa mentions that stack allocations cannot be resized. Nevertheless, would the following be validp  precode    struct MoveList             MoveList capacity10                   moves  Move allocasizeofMove  10                void resize                   capacity  2           moves  Move allocasizeofMove  capacity                 void pushback        Move moves        int size        int capacity      codepre  pSpecifically, if say, a capacity of 10 is insufficient from alloca the first time around, is it syntactically valid and correct to simply call alloca again to allocate some more memory strongWill this method give better performance compared to std vector with reserve, or only increase the chance of a stack overflowstrong My Move struct requires some 28 bytes of memory, and I suspect that the engine will recursively search using alphabeta to maybe 7 or 8 ply maximum so that perhaps some 28  35  8  8kb max will be used from the stack. I read somewhere that typically stacks have a limit of 1Mb so this should not be too much rightp  pEdit Thanks to the answers below, I realise now that my initial understanding of what alloca did was wrong. However, I would still like to know if it is possible to use alloca in the manner belowp  precode    int main              int arr  int allocasizeofint         arr  allocasizeofint  2 is this resizing valid      codepre

Negative 31482 pIm having difficulty with JQM and a codelistviewrefreshcode method.  Im not understanding how to resolve this problem.  After the login authenticates, it sends back a 200 code, then the app goes to the properties.html page and lists some properties, the app is running the JS and CSS, but it is not refreshing the UL list as it is supposed to.  Im getting this error that says codecannot call methods on listview prior to initialization attempted to call method refresh code.  However, if I manually type in the URL to go to properties.html directly it will display the data properly and runs the code.listviewrefreshcode to refresh the list, it just wont do it when the app goes to this page from the login.js page.  Im stuck and dont know how to resolve this.

Negative 31482 pSuppose that I have a Cassandra DB and I need to process a big bunch of data that I can query with a SELECT.

Negative 31482 pI have a Python script I use to execute commands in parallel across multiple hosts using the Python subprocess module.  It wraps SSH, and basically makes a call like thisp  precodeoutput  subprocess.Popen[binenv, env, usrbinssh, t, ss  user, host, , command], stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.PIPE.communicate codepre  pThe effective command gets executed like thisp  precodebinenv TERMTERMpassword usrbinssh t ss  user, host, , command codepre  pIt works fine, except I get an intermittent error where my terminal gets messed up loses newlines after running the script.  A reset from the command line fixes it, but Im not sure how this is happening, exactly.  I noticed that sometimes theres a strongrnstrong at the end of the the first item in the tuples output, and sometimes its not there.  See the following, specifically strongPermission deniedrnstrongp  precode Okay output  [userhomeuser] .command.py hosts.lists grep root etcshadow Running command grep root etcshadow on hosts in file hosts.test grep etcshadow Permission deniedrn, Connection to server1.example.com closed.rn grep etcshadow Permission deniedrn, Connection to server2.example.com closed.rn [userhomeuser]    Output causes terminal to not display newlines  [userhomeuser] .command.py hosts.list grep root etcshadow grep etcshadow Permission deniedrn, Connection to server1.example.com closed.rn grep etcshadow Permission deniedn, Connection to server2.example.com closed.rn                                  [userhomeuser] [userhomeuser] [userhomeuser] codepre  pThe second output has been slightly modified, but shows the missing strongrstrong, and how my prompt gets wacked after running the script.p  pI think this is related to using the t option in my subprocess command.  Somehow Im losing the r.  If I remove the t option, this issue goes away, but long story short, I need it for passing through environmental variables for use on the remote machine Im hackishly using the TERM variable to pass through the users password for sudo purposes, because I cant assume AcceptEnv is allowing arbitrary variable passing on the remote sshd server Im doing this to avoid passing the password on the command line, which will show up in the process list on the remote machine.p  pJust wondering if anyone knows a way to get around this, without removing the t optionp  pstrongUPDATEstrong It looks like my tty settings get altered after running the strongsubprocess.Popen....communicatestrong command within my script, regardless of whether or not I actually print the output to screen.

Negative 31482 pI define a template class like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename A, typename Bgt class SomeThing        codepre  pand I want to use codeSomeThingltX, Ygtcode.

Negative 31482 pSo... I did something I normally dont do, and copypasted this function which does exactly what I need.  I dont have the original source, as it was probably 6 months ago.  The good news is that it works great.  The bad news is that I dont quite understand it and want to make a modification.p  pThis function takes a list of strings that looks like rootsubcat1subcat2subcat3, spits it into a string array, and outputs to a hierarchical tree view displayed in WPF.p  pI want to alphabetize the tree on each level.  I see where an empty TreeObject parent is added to  iTreeSource... and iTreeSource is being returned, but no modification to it in the loop.  Why not, how is the completed TreeObject added to iTreeSource... and how to alphabetize  Also, any improvements that can be made would be welcome.p  precodeprivate ObservableCollectionltTreeObjectgt TreeLoadListltstringgt sortedPath     ObservableCollectionltTreeObjectgt iTreeSource  new ObservableCollectionltTreeObjectgt    TreeObject parent  new TreeObject    string pathConstructor  error    iTreeSource.Addparent    foreach string arrayPath in sortedPath           string[] individualPath  arrayPath.Split       if individualPath.Length gt 0                 pathConstructor  individualPath[0]          parent.Name  individualPath[0]              parent.Path  pathConstructor       TreeObject tempGroup  parent       if individualPath.Length gt 1                 for int i  0 i lt individualPath.Length i                       if tempGroup.Children.Count  0                             foreach TreeObject matchinGrp in tempGroup.Children                                   if matchinGrp.Path  pathConstructor                                         tempGroup  matchinGrp                      break                                                   if tempGroup.Path  pathConstructor                                   TreeObject child  new TreeObject                   child.Name  individualPath[i]                   child.Path  pathConstructor                   child.Parent  tempGroup                   tempGroup.Children.Addchild                   tempGroup  child                                          else                             if tempGroup.Path  pathConstructor                                   TreeObject child  new TreeObject                   child.Name  individualPath[i]                   child.Path  pathConstructor                   child.Parent  tempGroup                   tempGroup.Children.Addchild                   tempGroup  child                                          if i  individualPath.Length  1 ampamp individualPath.Length gt 1                             pathConstructor  string.Format01, pathConstructor, individualPath[i  1]                                   return iTreeSource  codepre

I could take in the XML, convert to JSON and store in Cloudant, then convert back to XML  to respond to a request.

By empty I mean that the structure including links is there, just the text inside the codeltagtcode tags.p  pThe generated menu on a post generated by the plugin looks like thisp  precodeltnav idprimarynavigation classsitenavigation primarynavigation rolenavigationgt     ltdiv classnavmenugt         ltulgt             ltli classpageitem pageitem1763gt                 lta hrefpageid1763gtltagt             ltligt             ltli classpageitem pageitem1761gt                 lta hrefpageid1761gtltagt             ltligt             [...]         ltulgt    ltdivgt ltnavgt codepre  pFor all other pages, the menu looks like thisp  precodeltnav idprimarynavigation classsitenavigation primarynavigation rolenavigationgt     ltdiv classnavmenugt         ltulgt             ltli classpageitem pageitem1763gt                 lta hrefpageid1763gtAboutltagt             ltligt             ltli classpageitem pageitem1761gt                 lta hrefpageid1761gtGalerieltagt             ltligt             [...]         ltulgt     ltdivgt ltnavgt codepre  pAs You can see, the only difference is that there is no text between the codeltagtcode and codeltagtcode tags, which makes the menu unusable.p  pWe really have no idea of how the plugin  customposttype creates this issue, as we tried this with different themes, and they all behave the same  so it is not an issue with the theme.p  pAny comment or hint that points in the right direction is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 31482 pim fairly new to OOP in PHP and id like some advice on whats the best practice for the case below Say, i own a store that sells different kind of things, eg. books, movies, and dinner plates. These different producttypes each have different properties dinner plates have a color and material, books have an author and movies have actors and a director. I could create a class for each of the types of products i sell, but then i need to recode when i also want to sell cats. Instead, i could create a class product, that has some properties that all products have eg. name, price, barcode. Now, whats the best way to store the producttype specific properties, an instance of an other class producttype or just a simple array within productp  pHopes below example explain it a little betterp  precodeclass product      private sname     private iprice     private sbarcode     private oproperties      function construct  name, productType           thisgtsname  name         thisgtiprice  getPriceFromDb  name          thisgtsbarcode  getBarcodeFromDb  name          thisgtoproperties  new productType  thisgtsname, productType         class productType      private apropertieValues     private adatatypes     private arequiredFields      function construct  name, productType           thisgtadatatypes  getDatatypesFromDb  productType          thisgtapropertieValues  getPropertieValuesFromDb  name          thisgtarequiredFields  getRequiredFieldsFromDb  productType        codepre  pIn the example above, its possible to also easily store for instance the datatype and required fields of the different properties the different productTypes have. An other way to go at it, is by simply using an array see below, but then you need to store the datatypes in an other array or your array will become very large and you always return the entire array.p  precodeclass product      private sname     private iprice     private sbarcode     private aproperties      function construct  name, productType           thisgtsname  name         thisgtiprice  getPriceFromDb  name          thisgtsbarcode  getBarcodeFromDb  name          thisgtaproperties  getOtherPropertiesFromDb  productType, name        codepre  pI think this last option undermines the purpose of objects, but im not sure. Ive looked into the possibility of extending the class product, but then i still need a specific class per productType. If there are other options im overlooking, please let me know.p  pI hope ive explained this in a way you can understand. p  pEdit I now see that i didnt ask my question very clear and that, in fact, i asked the wrong question. I therefor asked a new question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27138816PHP object class with configurable propertiesap

Even though the estimated parameters of the GPD are almost identical in each package, the quantiles differ a lot.p  pThe packages I used are ismev, extRemes, evir and POT.p  pI guess that the different estimates for the parameters of the GPD are due to different calculation routines, but I do not understand why the calculation of the quantiles differs that much depending on the different packages.p  pwhile lmom, evir and POT return the same quanatile values, the return period derived from the extRemes package differs from the other results.p  precode packages libraryismev libraryextRemes libraryevir libraryPOT librarylmom  th lt 50   sample data potvalues lt c   58.5,44.2,49.6,59.3,48.3,60.9,94.5,47.1,45.3,57.6,48.2,46.2,44.2,50.6,42.1,52.7,80.9,   58.5,51.3,48.4,51.7,71.9,60.1,64.4,43.5,55.5,49.3,58.2,47.5,43.7,45.2,52.8,42.2,46.4,   96.1,47.5,50.1,42.4,60.9,72.6,51.6,59.4,80.5,63.7,59.9,45.0,66.7,47.6,53.3,43.1,51.0,   46.2,53.6,59.8,51.7,46.7,42.6,44.5,45.0,50.0,44.0,89.9,44.2,47.8,53.3,43.0,55.7,44.6,   44.6,54.9,45.1,43.9,78.7,45.5,64.0,42.7,47.4,57.0,105.4,64.3,43.2,50.4,80.2,49.9,71.6,   47.4,44.1,47.6,55.2,44.4,78.6,50.8,42.4,47.1,43.5,51.4     MLE Fitting of GPD  package extRemes   fit gpd pot.ext lt fevdpotvalues, method  MLE, typeGP, thresholdth   return levels rl.extremes lt  return.levelpot.ext, conf  0.05,                              return.period c2,5,10,20,50,100 rl.extremes lt as.numericrl.extremes     MLE Fitting of GPD  package ismev  pot.gpd lt gpd.fitpotvalues, thresholdth  s1 lt quagpaf.99, paracpot.gpdthreshold, pot.gpdmle[1],pot.gpdmle[2]  100 s2 lt quagpaf.98, paracpot.gpdthreshold, pot.gpdmle[1],pot.gpdmle[2]   50 s3 lt quagpaf.95, paracpot.gpdthreshold, pot.gpdmle[1],pot.gpdmle[2]   20 s4 lt quagpaf.90, paracpot.gpdthreshold, pot.gpdmle[1],pot.gpdmle[2]   10 s5 lt quagpaf.80, paracpot.gpdthreshold, pot.gpdmle[1],pot.gpdmle[2]    5 s6 lt quagpaf.50, paracpot.gpdthreshold, pot.gpdmle[1],pot.gpdmle[2]    2  rl.ismev lt cs6, s5, s4, s3, s2, s1     MLE Fitting of GPD  package evir   fit gpd gpd.evir lt gpdpotvalues, thresholdth   plot evirplot lt plotgpd.evir 1  Excess Distribution 0  exit  x100 lt gpd.qpp.99, xevirplot  100 x050 lt gpd.qpp.98, xevirplot   50 x020 lt gpd.qpp.95, xevirplot   20 x010 lt gpd.qpp.90, xevirplot   10 x005 lt gpd.qpp.80, xevirplot    5 x002 lt gpd.qpp.50, xevirplot    2  rl.evir lt trbindx002,x005,x010,x020,x050,x100 rl.evir lt as.numericrl.evir[2,]     MLE Fitting of GPD  package POT  gpd.pot lt fitgpdpotvalues, thresholdth quant  c0.50, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.98, 0.99 rtp lt c2,5,10,20,50,100  retvec lt vector for i in quant   x lt POTqgpdi, loc  th, scale  as.numericgpd.potparam[1],             shape  as.numericgpd.potparam[2]   retvec lt cretvec,x   rl.pot lt retvec    comparison of results  return periods result lt cbindrl.extremes,rl.ismev, rl.evir, rl.pot roundresult, 2    comparison of estimated parameters param.extremes lt pot.extresultspar  extremes param.ismev lt pot.gpdmle  ismev param.evir lt cgpd.evirpar.ests[2],gpd.evirpar.ests[1]   evir param.pot lt gpd.potparam  POT  parameters lt cbindparam.extremes, param.ismev , param.evir, param.pot roundparameters, 4   codepre

Negative 31482 pFirst of all, here is what Im trying to accomplish Wed like to add the capability to our commercial application to generate a video file to visualize data.  It should be saved in a reasonably compressed format.  It is important that the encoding librarycodecs are licensed such that were allowed to use and sell our software without restriction. Its also important that the media format can easily be played by a customer, i.e. can be played by Windows Media Player without requiring a codec pack to be installed.p  pIm trying to use DirectShow in c by creating a source filter with one output pin that generates the video. Im closely following the DirectShow samples called Bouncing Ball and Push Source. In GraphEdit I can successfully connect to a video renderer and see the video play. I have also managed to connect to AVI Mux and then file writer to write an uncompressed AVI file. The only issue with this is the huge file size. However, I have not been able to save the video in a compressed format. This problem also happens with the Ball and Push Source samples.p  pI can connect the output pin to a WM ASF Writer, but when I click play I get This graph cant play. Unspecified error Return code 0x80004005. I cant even figure out how to connect to the WMVideo9 Encoder DMO These filters cannot agree on a connection. I could successfully save to mjpeg, but compression was not very substantial.p  pPlease let me know if Im doing something wrong in GraphEdit or if my source filter code needs to be modified. Alternatively, if there is another nonDirectShow option that would work for me Im open to suggestions. Thanks.p

I also have a shoe brand table where say Nike is row 1, Adidas row 2, Reebok row 3 and ShoeBrandName is the name of the column with the name and ShoeBrandID is the ID associated with the name. p  pWhen I upload my data to my temp table it will look like thisp  precode              TEMPTBL  Personal ID              Shoe Brand   123456                    Nike codepre  pBut when I move it to my main table I am using an insert with left outer join and the same data as above in the main table will look like thisp  precode              MAINTBL  Personal ID              ShoeBrand   123456                      1 codepre  pHere is where my problem comes in. Say the user uploads another file with the same Personal ID, and the difference is the shoe brand changes from Nike to Reebok. I would need the main table to update to thisp  precode         MAINTBL After Update   Personal ID              ShoeBrand   123456                      3 codepre  pHere is the code I am trying to runp  precodeUPDATE [MAINTBL] SET [ShoeBrand]  b.[ShoeBrandID]  FROM [TEMPTBL] a left outer join [MAINTBL].tblshoebrand b on a.[Shoe Brand]  b.ShoeBrandName  WHERE [Personal ID]  123456 codepre  pThis code runs, but does nothing..... literally nothing.p  pCan anyone give me some advicep

Negative 31482 pSo I built a weather app that gets data from the forecast.io api and the flickr api after geocoding a location. It works fine when Im running it locally.

If so, how would I write that codePlayerViewcode subclass shown in ObjectiveC in Swift Thank you in advance for any assistance.p

Negative 31482 pI want to execute a SELECT query on a database table that has 6 key fields, lets assume they are keyA, keyB, ..., keyF.p  pAs input parameters to my ABAP function module I do receive an internal table with exactly that structure of the key fields, each entry in that internal table therefore corresponds to one tuple in the database table. p  pThus I simply need to select all tuples from the database table that correspond to the entries in my internal table. Furthermore, I want to aggregate an amount column in that database table in exactly the same query.p  pIn pseudo SQL the query would look as follows SELECT SUMamount FROM table WHERE keyA, keyB, keyC, keyD, keyE, keyF IN internal table.p  pHowever, this representation is not possible in ABAP OpenSQL.p  pOnly one column such as keyA is allowed to state, not a composite key. Furthermore I can only use selection tables those with SIGN, OPTIOn, LOW, HIGH after they keyword IN. Using FOR ALL ENTRIES seems feasible, however in this case I cannot use SUM since aggregation is not allowed in the same query.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 31482 pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pI am attempting to link an external vertical scrollbar to a datagridview. I need an external scrollbar as I want it to be constantly visible whether there are an excess of rows or not. Sounded simple when I started but I am having trouble with resizing rows. p  pstrongThe Attemptsstrongp  pI have attempted to scroll per row Scrollbar maximum being the row count, small change being 1, large change being the count of displayed rows. This did not work because of the ability to resize rows as this changes the amount of displayed rows which in turn sets the large change and therefore screws up the scroll bar.p  pI came to the conclusion that the best way was to scroll by pixel values. Default DGV behavior scrolls by row and not pixels so I need to convert a pixel value into a row index so I can set the FirstDisplayedScrollingRowIndex property. However, I am looking for a method to get the row at a specific point. I have tried HitTestInfo but this seems to only work for displayed rows and not rows that are out of view.p  pThe best way I have found to do it so far is to Lambda loop through the rows and find which row falls within the Y coordinate.p  precode    Dim Block As Integer  IfDGV.ColumnHeadersVisible, DGV.ColumnHeadersHeight, 0     Dim ScrollToRow As DataGridViewRow  DGV.Rows.CastOf DataGridViewRow.FirstOrDefaultFunctionx                                                                                               Block  x.Height                                                                                               Return Block gt VSB.Value                                                                                           End Function     DGV.FirstDisplayedScrollingRowIndex  IfScrollToRow IsNot Nothing, ScrollToRow.Index, 0 codepre  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pIs there a method I am missing that can give me a row or its index by a Y coordinate Obviously this should include rows that are not currently being displayed.p  pAlternatively, any other suggestions on how I can do thisp

This behavior is also used in the event that   user passes the command line option e to the program.p      pIf the user passes the command line option c, then the program   converts the expression into its equivalent infix notation,   parenthesizing subexpressions only as necessary.p      pIf the user passes the command line option g, then the program   generates a series of instructions in a mock assembly language which   if performed by a hypothetical computer, would evaluate the   expression. The instruction sequence output by the program assumes the   existence of an infinite number of machine registers.p      pINPUT SYNTAXp      pThe rpcalc utility assumes that input expression makes use of the   following binary operators integersp      pA  denoting addition S  denoting subtraction X  denoting   multiplication D  denoting integer division M  denoting the modulus   operation For example, the program may be run as followsp      prpcalc 5 4  X 18 S 5 D 3 52p      prpcalc c 5 4  X 18 S 5 D 3 5  4  18  5  3 p      pMOCK ASSEMBLY LANGUAGEp      pThe assembly language output through the use of the g option is   fairly simple consisting of the following instructionsp      pMOV R VALUEp      pR denotes a numbered register e.g. R1, R2, ...p      pVALUE denotes an integerp      pInstructions of this form are read as move VALUE into register R.p      pADD R1 R2 R3p      pR1, R2, and R3 denote distinct registersp      pInstructions of this form are read as add the contents of register R2 to the p      pcontents of register R1, saving the results to register R3p      pSUB R1 R2 R3p      pR1, R2, and R3 denote distinct registersp      pInstructions of this form are read as subtract the contents of register R2      from the contents of register R1, saving the results   to register R3p      pMUL R1 R2 R3p      pR1, R2, and R3 denote distinct registersp      pInstructions of this form are read as multiply the contents of register R1 by the contents of register R2, saving the results to   register R3p      pDIV R1 R2 R3p      pR1, R2, and R3 denote distinct registersp      pInstructions of this form are read as divide the contents of register R1 by the contents of register R2, saving the quotient to   register R3p      pMOD R1 R2 R3p      pR1, R2, and R3 denote distinct registersp      pInstructions of this form are read as divide the contents of register R1 by the contents of register R2, saving the remainder to   register R3p      pWRT R1p      pR1 denotes a registerp      pInstructions of this form are read as write the contents of R1 to the screenp blockquote  pAs you can see its a little bit more than a simple RPN calculator.  We had to do a basic RPN calculator as a lab earlier this semester and I just used a stack implementation.  For this program, our professor is telling us the best way to go about doing it is using both a stack along with a binary search tree.  I was hoping someone could break it down to me why I would need both of these data structures for this program, or why it would be most necessary.  As far as I can see, I should be able to complete the program using either data type, and fail to see how using both would be relevant.

Negative 31482 pI am trying to write an app engine application for my university. What I am trying to achieve right now, is to create a method which takes in a Course name, and returns a list of all the CourseYears think of that as being like a link table e.g. if Maths is the course, and it has Year 1, year 2 and Year 3 MathsYear1, MathsYear2 and MathsYear3 would be the names of the CourseYears.p  pThis is the code for the module WARING super dirty code belowp  precode    ApiMethodname  courseYears  public ArrayListltCourseYeargt courseYearsNamedname String name     DatastoreService datastore  DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService      Query.Filter keyFilter  new Query.FilterPredicatename, Query.FilterOperator.EQUAL, name      Query query  new QueryCourse.setFilterkeyFilter     PreparedQuery preparedQuery  datastore.preparequery      ListltEntitygt resultList  preparedQuery.asListFetchOptions.Builder.withLimit1      Course course  ofy.load.typeCourse.class.idresultList.get0.getKey.getId.now      ArrayListltStringgt courseYearNames  course.getAllCourseYearNames      System.out.printlncourse.getName      ArrayListltCourseYeargt courseYears  new ArrayListltCourseYeargt      forString courseYearName courseYearNames         Query.Filter courseNameFilter  new Query.FilterPredicatename, Query.FilterOperator.EQUAL, courseYearName         Query query2  new QueryCourseYear.setFiltercourseNameFilter         ListltEntitygt resL  preparedQuery.asListFetchOptions.Builder.withLimit1          System.out.printlntest          CourseYear courseYear  ofy.load.typeCourseYear.class.idresL.get0.getKey.getId.now         courseYears.addcourseYear           return courseYears  codepre  pIt basically takes a Course name in, applies a filter on all courses to get the corresponding Course object, and then calls getAllCourseYearNames on the course to get an array list containing all its CourseYears names. I would have loved to do this using Keys, but parameterised Objectify keys dont seem to be supported in this version of App Engine.p  pI then try and get the CourseYears by looping through the arraylist of names and applying the filter for each name. I print test each time to see how many times it is looping. Like I said, a super dirty way of doing it. p  pWhen I try passing a few course names as a parameters, it loops the correct number of times only once or twice, and after that does not loop at all doesnt print test. I could understand if it never looped, but not doing it correctly once or twice and then never again. It doesnt successfully return a list of CourseYears when it does work, but rather the relevant number of NULLs  I dont know if this is relevant. I believe it successfully retrieves the course every time, as I print the name of the course after loading and it never fails to do this.p  pIf anyone has ANY suggestions for why this may be happening, I would be incredibly grateful to hear themp  pThanksp

Negative 31482 pI wanted to build a custom zlib DLL that includes the symbol table. I used MinGW and the DLL works correctly and indeed includes the symbol table but it has to be named zlib1.dll in order to work. I want to name it zlib1debug.dll to distinguish it from the regular stripped version. How can I inform my applications to load the renamed DLL I dont want to use the LoadLibrary function. I also made a libzdebug.a file from the object files used to create the DLL. When I compile an example program which is supposed to use the new DLL, I pass lzdebug to the linker. It compiles without errors, but it still wants to load zlib1.dll when I run it. I expected it would try to load zdebug.dll but apparently thats not how it works.p

Negative 31482 pRight now I have a database in phpMyAdmin, and off the the side of the screen, it shows the database name, and a list of tables inside the database. Its fine if its only a couple of tables, but when theres dozens of tables, it gets hard to find the tables I want to edit. Ive thought about creating another database to make it easier to organize, but then Ill have to connect using the different databases name and a different user login for the database, and I just thought how much easier would it be if I can make folders or something similar inside the database I already have to organize my tables. Im wondering if something like this is possible, or anyone know any workaround this issue. Thanks. p

I want the tabs to refresh every time they are opened since ill be constantly changing the material in the lists.p  precodepackage com.towntrot.anil.towntroteventmanager02  import android.os.Bundle import android.support.v4.app.Fragment import android.support.v4.view.PagerAdapter import android.support.v4.view.ViewPager import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.ListView import android.widget.Toast  import java.util.ArrayList  public class SlidingTabsBasicFragment extends Fragment   ListView list public ArrayListltListModelgt CustomListViewValuesArr  new ArrayListltListModelgt public guestlist gg private SlidingTabLayout mSlidingTabLayout private ViewPager mViewPager private String[] eventtypeCHECKED IN,CHECKED OUT,WAITING  Override public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,         Bundle savedInstanceState      return inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentsample, container, false   Override public void onViewCreatedView view, Bundle savedInstanceState      mViewPager  ViewPager view.findViewByIdR.id.viewpager     mViewPager.setAdapternew SamplePagerAdapter     mSlidingTabLayout  SlidingTabLayout view.findViewByIdR.id.slidingtabs     mSlidingTabLayout.setViewPagermViewPager   class SamplePagerAdapter extends PagerAdapter       Override     public int getCount          return 3           Override     public boolean isViewFromObjectView view, Object o          return o  view           Override     public CharSequence getPageTitleint position          return eventtype[position]           Override     public Object instantiateItemViewGroup container, int position           View view  getActivity.getLayoutInflater.inflateR.layout.pageritem,                 container, false         guestlist ggguestlistgetActivity         StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder         sb.append         sb.appendposition         String strI  sb.toString         Toast.makeTextgetActivity,strI,Toast.LENGTHLONG.show         setListDatagg.getNamelist, gg.getStatuslist, gg.getNo0fPeople, position         list  ListView view.findViewByIdR.id.list         CustomAdapter adapter         adapternew CustomAdapter getActivity, CustomListViewValuesArr         list.setAdapteradapter         container.addViewview         return view           Override     public void destroyItemViewGroup container, int position, Object object          container.removeViewView object        public void setListDataString[] string,String[] status,int no,int pos      CustomListViewValuesArr.clear     for int i  0 i lt no i           final ListModel name  new ListModel         int xInteger.parseIntstatus[i]         ifposx name.setCompanyNamestring[i]         CustomListViewValuesArr.addname          codepre  pPlease help me, Ive seen a lot of answers but couldnt solve this.

Negative 31482   pGiven two discrete random variables, their arbitrary probability mass functions codeacode and codebcode and a naturalnumber codeNcode such that both of the variables have the domain code[0..N]code therefore the functions can be represented as arrays, the probability that the functions corresponding random variables have a given sum i.e. codePABtargetcode can be computed, in ON time, by treating the arrays as vectors and using their dot product, albeit with one of the inputs reversed and both inputs resliced in order to align them and eliminate bounds errors thus each position codeicode of codeacode is matched with a position codejcode of codebcode such that codeijtargetcode.

Evaluating the entirety of this probability mass function and thereby producing the array that corresponds thereto can be done in ONsup2 time by performing N dotproducts, with each product having its operands differentlyshifted i.e.p  pre classlanghs prettyprintoverridecodepm  Vector Int gt Vector Int gt Vector Ratio Int pm a b  map P a b  generate 2  length a  1 id codepre  hr  pI am told, however, that producing such a table of values of this probability mass function can actually be done in ONlogN time. As far as I can tell, no two of the multiplications across all of the involved dotproducts share the same ordered pair of indices, and I do not think that I can, e.g., combine two dotsubproducts in any useful way to form a codeTn2Tn2Oncodetype recursion therefore I am curious as to how and why, exactly, such a runtime is possible.p

If I write a C tool which will get data from any number of sources xml, csv or direct from some tables from a remote db, a configuration file or registry setting will dictate which format the data is being imported from and then do the insert  update  deleted, will this be fast enough andor will cause deadlock issuesp  pI hope my questions are elaborate enough...

Negative 31482 pI am looking for a best approach in determining if a spring batch job has completed that does not involve using a job listener.  I am using the jsr compliant components.

It seems there should be a better approach.  That some where in memory that the operator or some other object would have the current status of a job with out having to go to the db. Or possibly a way to do a callback with out having to define it in the job spec.p
