Positive 1759 pI have a datagrid which is bound to an observable collection of records in a viewmodel. In the datagrid I have a DataGridTemplateColumn holding a combobox which is populated from a list in the viewmodel.

Positive 1759 pI have some code which populates a combobox with database names. I then have a button which saves the name back to My.Settings and creates the connection string. p  pThis is working for the most part.

Positive 1759 pI have a Datagrid that I am attempting to display the value in a combo box. The comboboxs values are dynamic and are several lists concatenated together. I am having trouble getting the Node Name column to display its initial value after I Deserialize the XML and set the data context. p  pAll other columns and bound data works. The only one I am having trouble with is the Node Name column. p  pThe values in the combo appear when I drop it down, I am able to select a value, and the value displays after the selection and the combobox has lost focus. This is only the initial deserialization and displaying of the value that I am having trouble with. It is also worth noting that strongSelectedTeststrong changes when a column in another datagrid is selected, Updating the currently selected test and changing the data in this datagrid. This works, all other data populates except the Node Name column. p  pI have also verified that the object is deserialized properly and the data is present in the object.p  pXAMLp  precodeltDataGrid

It is a problem for me. I do not want to add a listener to the text property of the combo box editor, because this will result in the listener getting called everytime the user adds one character to the combo box. I just want a listener that reacts when the user has written some input in the combobox and switched focus, or when he has selected an option from the combo box popup. And it needs to be platform independent. I.e I want the windows 8 behaviour of value and selectedItem property in both Windows 7 and 8 and on any other platform.p  pIs this possiblep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pWhen I wrote this, Java version was 1.8.045 on both platforms. When I updated both to 1.8.060 The value and selectedItem property behaviour became identical on both platforms.p  pHowever. I still want a listener that reacts when the user has written some input in the combobox and switched focus, or when he has selected an option from the combo box popup and switched focus. Should I just add a listener to the focus property that checks the editor text when ever the combo box loses focus, or is there a better wayp

Negative 1759 pIm developing an application that manages network interfaces on behalf of the user and it calls out to several external programs such as ifconfig that requires root to make changes. Specifically, changing the IP address of a local interface, etc. During development, I have been running the IDE as root ugh and the debugger as root doubleugh. Is there a nice way for the enduser to run these under a nonroot account I strongly dislike the size of the attack surface presented by GTK, wxPython, Python, and my application when it runs as root.p  pI have looked into capabilities, but they look halfbaked and Im not sure if Id be able to use them in Python, especially if they are on a thread basis. The only option I havent explored is a daemon that has the setuid bit set and does all the roottype stuff on behalf of the UI. Im hesitant to introduce that complexity this early in the project, as running as root is not a dealbreaker for the users.p
Negative 1759 pIve got a strange problem with indexing PDF files in SQL Server 2005, and hope someone can help.  My database has a table called MediaFile with the following fields  MediaFileId int identity pk, FileContent image, and FileExtension varchar5. Ive got my web application storing file contents in this table with no problems, and am able to use fulltext searching on doc, xls, etc with no problems  the only file extension not working is PDF.  When performing fulltext searches on this table for words which I know exist inside of PDF files saved in the table, these files are not returned in the search results.p  pThe OS is Windows Server 2003 SP2, and Ive installed a hrefhttpwww.adobe.comsupportdownloadsdetail.jspftpID2611Adobe iFilter 6.0a.  Following the instructions on a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netwallymarchive20050228382060.aspxthis blog entrya, I executed the following commandsp  precodeexec spfulltextservice loadosresources, 1 exec spfulltextservice verifysignature, 0 codepre  pAfter this, I restarted the SQL Server, and verified that the iFilter for the PDF extensions is installed correctly by executing the following commandp  precodeselect documenttype, path from sys.fulltextdocumenttypes where documenttype  .pdf codepre  pThis returns the following information, which looks correctp  blockquote   pdocumenttype .pdfbr   path CProgram FilesAdobePDF IFilter 6.0PDFFILT.dllp blockquote  pThen I recreated the index on the MediaFile table, selecting FileContent as the column to index and the FileExtension as its type.  The wizard creates the index and completes successfully.  To test, Im performing a search like thisp  precodeSELECT MediaFileId, FileExtension FROM MediaFile WHERE CONTAINS, house codepre  pThis returns DOC files which contain this term, but not any PDF files, although I know that there are definitely PDF files in the table which contain the word emhouseem.p  pIncidentally, I got this working once for a few minutes, where the search above returned the correct PDF files, but then it just stopped working again for no apparent reason.p  pAny ideas as to what could be stopping SQL Server 2005 from indexing PDFs, even though Adobe iFilter is installed and appears to be loadedp

Negative 1759 pI am using Hibernate 3.x, MySQL 4.1.20 with Java 1.6. I am mapping a Hibernate Timestamp to a MySQL TIMESTAMP. So far so good.  The problem is that MySQL stores the TIMESTAMP in seconds and discards the milliseconds and I now need millisecond precision.

I am doing a timetable organizer, and I draw each event in a DayViewController with Quarz 2D, then I add a glass effect picture PNG.p  pBut randomly, as I switch between days, the layout go really bad. Here is a link to see the good appearance and below the bad one  a hrefhttptoucotton.ifrance.comimage.jpg relnofollowhttptoucotton.ifrance.comimage.jpgap  hr  pI dont know why this is happening. Some times I have the color of past events that are partially laid on the half of displayed ones. Is there any cache Core Graphics has that has to be flushed or something  Actually, I create a DayViewController in a background thread but I add its view to my superview in the main thread ...p  pI just wanted to know if youve ever seen such bizarre things like that before  Bye and thanks in advance.p

Negative 1759 pI coded some calculation stuff I copied below a really simplifed example of what I did like CASE2 and got bad results. Refactored the code like CASE1 and worked fine. I know there is an implicit cast in CASE 2, but not sure of the full reason. strongAny one could explain me whats exactly happening belowstrongp  precode  CASE 1, result 5.5     double auxMedia  5  6     auxMedia  auxMedia  2      CASE 2, result 5.0     double auxMedia1  5  6  2      CASE 3, result 5.5     double auxMedia3  5.0  6.0  2.0      CASE 4, result 5.5     double auxMedia4  5  6  2.0 codepre  pMy guess is that 2 in CASE2 is casting 5  6 to int and causing round of division to 5, then casted again to double and converted to 5.0.p  pCASE3 and CASE 4 also fixes the problem.p
Negative 1759 pI have a bit array implementation where the 0th index is the MSB of the first byte in an array, the 8th index is the MSB of the second byte, etc... p  pWhats a fast way to find the first bit that is set in this bit array All the related solutions I have looked up find the first least significant bit, but I need the first most significant one. So, given 0x00A1, I want 8 since its the 9th bit from the left.p
Negative 1759 pI decided to learn concurrency and wanted to find out in how many ways instructions from two different processes could overlap. The code for both processes is just a 10 iteration loop with 3 instructions performed in each iteration. I figured out the problem consisted of leaving X instructions fixed at a point and then fit the other X instructions from the other process between the spaces taking into account that they must be ordered instruction 4 of process B must always come before instruction 20.p  pI wrote a program to count this number, looking at the results I found out that the solution is n Combination k, where k is the number of instructions executed throughout the whole loop of one process, so for 10 iterations it would be 30, and n is k2 2 processes. In other words, n number of objects with n2 fixed and having to fit n2 among the spaces without the latter n2 losing their order.p  pOk problem solved. No, not really. I have no idea why this is, I understand that the definition of a combination is, in how many ways can you take k elements from a group of n such that all the groups are different but the order in which you take the elements doesnt matter. In this case we have n elements and we are actually taking them all, because all the instructions are executed  n C n.p  pIf one explains it by saying that there are 2k blue A and red B objects in a bag and you take k objects from the bag, you are still only taking k instructions when 2k instructions are actually executed. Can you please shed some light into thisp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 1759 pmy layouts requirement is to keep all thumbnails at 80px height, not higher, not smaller. In my model I set the style to codethumbgt 500x80gtcode, so basically almost every picture which is not too wide gets its perfect miniature with 80px height. Sometimes, however, my pictures are narrow and high, so the thumb can have unclickable dimensions of like 5x80. So I dont want to crop pictures as long as thumbnails are not getting crazy narrow, but I think I can make a little sacrifice and crop them if thumbs width is getting smaller than 25px.p  pSo my questions is  is it possible in paperclip to set minimal proportions of a picture by which the style will be code500x80gtcode and beyond that it will turn to sth like code25x80codep

Negative 1759 pI was just curious as to what the rule of thumb was for models. Generally, I use them only for situations where I need to addedit or update database entries for an object. p  pHowever, Im building an app at the moment that has a config table which holds various data, such as last updated, which will control when certain features in the app should be displayed.

Negative 1759 pI have a Flash presentation made in Flash CS4 with AS3 I am working on and running in a standalone Flash player.

However, you can always just work through their use of DefaultHttpClient and see how they instantiated it to get it to work.  I decided to use the whole class because it handles some things for me, like automatic redirect following and reporting the final destination url that are helpful.p  pThanks for the help all.p  h1Edit TinyBixoh1  pHi all.  So, I loved how Bixo worked, but didnt like that it had so many dependencies including all of Hadoop.  So, I created a vastly simplified Bixo, without all the dependencies.

Negative 1759 pI have a table with shadows above the top and below the bottom cell using Matt Gallaghers solution here a hrefhttpcocoawithlove.com200908addingshadoweffectstouitableview.htmlhttpcocoawithlove.com200908addingshadoweffectstouitableview.htmla. These are added in the layoutSubviews method of the UITableView class extension.p  pI dynamically add and delete cells below each main cell these provide additional data  lets call these detail cells. There is only one ever open at a time. When deleting the detail cell beneath the last main cell, as the animation begins, the shadow flicks upwards to the last cell above the detail cell. It does this because the layoutSubview methods considers the last cell of the table to have changed the moment the animation for deleteRowsAtIndexPaths begins rather than when the animation ends.p  pSo, in essence, I need a way to keep the shadow below the detail cell as its being deleted. Not sure of the best way to do this. If the UITableView no longer considers that cell to be the last cell, then I am not sure even how to get the cell since the UITableView gets the cell thusp  precodeNSIndexPath lastRow  [indexPathsForVisibleRows lastObject] if [lastRow section]  [self numberOfSections]  1 ampamp     [lastRow row]  [self numberOfRowsInSection[lastRow section]]  1           adds shadow below it here       codepre  pSo even trapping the start of the animation is not much use if the UITableView still thinks the main cell above the detail cell is the lastObject.p  pThanks for any ideas.p

Negative 1759 pI have a C program that needs to schedule various future processes to kick off on a onetimeonly basis.p  pThe development is in Linux so the obvious choice is to use the at command Im not interested in writing my own job schedulerp  pHowever Im reluctant to fork an OS process from my program to call the at executable directly  as this is messy, and cumbersome.p  pWith cron, I know you can write jobs as files out to etccron.d without the need to fork to crontab.  However no such facility seems to exist for at.p  pA bit of research has lead me to the conclusion that I emcouldem simply write files to varspoolcronatjobs using the formant axxxxxyyyyyyyy where xjob id and y  hex epoch time in minutes  but this hardly seems in the spirit of Linux security or convention.... plus the filename format is not portable across all nix systems, should I wish to use another operating system.p  pOf course I could use cron, but it doesnt sensibly cater for onetimeonly jobs, so this doesnt strike me as a good solution either.  Nor do I want to grab the source for these tools and rework the necessary bits into my program  this too isnt exactly portable.p  pSo my question is  if I want to schedule execution of future jobs at a given time and date for a single run can anyone suggest a programatically nice way of either interfacing at or the cron daemon directly without having to fork to the OS in C.... or is there another standard tool that provides thisp

Negative 1759 pI have a royal pain in the butt problem.  I have a page layout where there are two columns to a table.  The right column is always 300px wide, but the left column is to fill the remaining space in the container.  This is easy enough with the followingp  precodelttable width100 cellpadding0 cellspacing0gt   lttrgt     lttd widthgt     lttdgt     lttd width300gt     lttdgt   lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pNow, I want the left column to contain a div that has some styling applied to it.  In that styling there is a rule that the width of the div is 300px.  This is fine for the RIGHT column, but I want the left column to be filled by the div.  My instincts tell me to add a style tag with width inherit but that doesnt work, it simply strips the width altogether.  I believe this to be because CSS doesnt know how to inherit width. p  pSo, what is the best way to style this div in the left column such that it fills the TD  Any width  value is calculated relative to the page, not the container.  p  pMy only solution havent done this yet that I can come up with is to resize the TD with CSS whenever the window paints, then the divs style inherit would work, I believe.  I REALLY dont want to do it that way as Im praying theres a CSS compliant way of doing this.p
Negative 1759 pMost language use shortcircuited andor operators. For examplep  precodereturn foo ampamp bar codepre  pwill never call bar if foo returns false. There is no need to call bar if we know that the result of the expression will be false anyways.p  pPresumably, this behavior was originally implemented in order to make code run faster. However, technology has changed since then. In particular branches are more expensive relative to other operations then would have been the case when shortcircuiting was introduced. p  pSo Im wondering is it still a performance gain to short circuit operators p
Negative 1759 pIve been having a few problems with ZendLocale and ZendTranslate, specifically with htmlentities. But there a couple of other oddities.p  pFirstly, in the ZendLocale documentation it statesp  blockquote   pZend Framework allows the usage of an application wide locale. You   simply set an instance of ZendLocale to the registry with the key   ZendLocale. Then this instance will be used within all locale aware   classes of Zend Frameworkp blockquote  pThis does not seem to work with ZendTranslate, Im assuming ZendTranslate is not a locale aware class, weird that it isnt but no big problem I just had to set it explicitly. Below is the initLocale function from my Bootstrapp  precodesession  new ZendSessionNamespace   only if locale is explicitly set by user ifissetGET[locale] ampamp emptyGET[locale]      sessiongtlocale  GET[locale]   locale  issetsessiongtlocale  sessiongtlocale  auto  try      zendLocale  new ZendLocalelocale  catch ZendLocaleException e      zendLocale  new ZendLocaleenCA      ZendRegistrysetZendLocale, zendLocale  requireonceAPPLICATIONPATH . languagestranslation.php  translate  new ZendTranslatearray     adapter gt array,     content gt english,     locale  gt en   translategtaddTranslationarray     content gt french,     locale  gt fr   translategtsetLocalezendLocalegttoString      ZendRegistrysettranslate, translate codepre  pAs you can see here, Im using the array adapter for ZendTranslate. My arrays are defined in translation.php. p  pSimilarly to ZendLocale in the documentation for ZendForm httpframework.zend.commanualenzend.form.i18n.html it says the easiest way to add translations to ZendForm is to set a ZendTranslate object in the registry with a key of ZendTranslate  easy, set this up and any of the form labels, error messages, etc. that have a matching translation in the arrays will be translated automagically. Problem is that my french translations have a lot of htmlentities. I could be wrong but I believe that ZendForms setLabel method escapes text, so my entities are getting converted twice. I tried removing all entities from the translations but this completely fails and gives me a blank output. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas htmlentities for translations seems like a major necessity rightp  pCurrently Im not doing this automatically but Ive added an intermediate function to my form which does the following where thistranslate is a ZendTranslate objectp  precodeprivate function getTranslationstr      return htmlentitydecodethisgttranslategtstr, ENTCOMPAT, UTF8  codepre  pBut this is far from ideal as I have to wrap every setLabel and errorMessage in this first, kind of missing the point of Zends locale and translation classes.p

Negative 1759 pI am building an av html5 streaming web app.  This question pretains to the audio portion of the project, but im sure i will run into a similar situation when i get started on the video portion.  My target device is the iPads safari browser hence why i have to do this html5.  Playback works fine, but i have a loading bar which needs to reflect how much of the track has been loaded.  Following the w3 spec, i tried to implement this the following way using jQueryp  precodevar that  this that.player  audio[0]  that.player.bindprogress,function     var buffer  that.player.buffered.end0           that.updateLoadBufferbuffer  codepre  pThis did not work.  that.player.buffered returns a TimeRanges object, and TimeRanges have a method endindex which returns the playback position of end of the buffer in seconds for the TimeRange specified by index.  TimeRanges also have a .length property which tells you how many TimeRanges are encapsulated by the object.  When i tried to log that property i found that TimeRanges.length  0, meaning no TimeRanges are passed back.  Also when i threw logging statements into the bound function, i found that the progress event was never fired.  I have separate functions for the loadedmetata and timeupdate events which follow a similar format, and those fire off as expected.  I tried other methods for capturing events to no availp  precodethat.player.onprogress  functione      console.logprogressEvent heard   that.player.addEventListenerprogress,progressHandler, false function progressHandlere     console.logprogressEvent heard  codepre  pNeither of these triggered my console message.  My audio tag declaration is as followsp  precodeltaudio stylewidth0height0gtltaudiogt codepre  pwhat am i doing wrong herep  pUPDATE  I am using wowzamediaserver to handle the http streaming.  I dont know if that could have anything to do with it. p  pYET ANOTHER UPDATE  I realize i do not have a source in my audio tag, that is because i set it dynamically using jquery, as followsp  precodeaudio.attrsrc,httpmy.wowza.server1935myStreamingAppdefinstmp3pathtomytrackaudio.mp3playlist.m3u8 codepre  pagain i am not having playback issues so this shouldnt have any bearing on my problem, but i just want to give you guys as clear of a picture as possible.  p

Negative 1759 pI have a set of 2 curves each with a few hundreds to a couple thousands datapoints that I want to compare and get some similarity score.

Any idea If you look at those 2 lines, they are fairly similar and I think that in a first step, measuring the area under the 2 curves and subtracting would do. I look at the post Shaded area under 2 curves in R but that is not quite what I need.p  pA second issue optional is that for lines that have the same profile but different amplitude, I would like to score those as very similar even though the area under them would be bigp  precodec1 lt c0, 0.8, 0.9, 0.9, 0.5, 0.1, 0.5  c4 lt c0, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3  very good, score of  codepre  pI hope that a biologist pretending to formulate problem to programmer is OK...p  pId be happy to provide some real life examples if needed.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1759 pIve found this question posed a few times, but no definitive answers as yet. Looks like a decent solution would help quite a few people.p  pSo we create an excel file .xlsx on the server and download it to the client using contentdisposition attachment. The Open Save dialog appears and all works fine if you choose Save, or Open and then Save As... However if you choose Open and then hit the Save... button then Excel hangs for a moment and then presents the message Your changes could not be saved to Export[5].xlsx because of a sharing violation. Try saving to a different file. then The file you are trying to open F8CAC020.IE5HM2NBE5CF8CAC020, is in a different format than specified by the file extension. Verify that the file is not corrupted and is from a trusted source before opening the file. Do you want to open the file now then you finally get the Save As dialog assuming you pressed Yes.p  pCode for creating the file isp  precodeResponse.Clear Response.ContentType  applicationvnd.openxmlformatsofficedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet Response.AppendHeadercontentdisposition, attachmentfilenameExport.xlsx Response.AddHeaderContentLength, New System.IO.FileInfoNewFile.Length Response.TransmitFileNewFile Response.Flush codepre  pIf you remove the contentdisposition header you get the right sort of behaviour in Excel, but with the wrong name and no guarantee that the Excel document will not instead be shown in the browser depending on client settings. If you press Open and then Save then you  get a message default.aspx is readonly. To save a copy, click OK, then give the workbook a new name in the Save As dialog box.p  pSo the question is how to combine the 2 behaviours into a reasonable one Get the nice error message directly above, when you try to Open and then Save a downloaded file, but also specify that the document should be downloaded and given a default filename.p  pCheers,p  pJamesp

Am I missing something I know that you should not have folder name in namespace because that would mean that referencing resource in View is dependent on folder name and this is not correct. p  pThe point is I would like to have the same behaviour of resources wheter they are organized in folders or not...p  pBy the way I check on the web and could not find any appropriate solution.p  pThank you for your answersp

I have an acyclic directional graph, and every edge has a distance value. And I want to find a shortest path. Simple, right Well, there are a couple of reasons I cant just use Dijkstras or A.p  ol liemI dont care at allem what the starting node of my path is, nor the ending node. I just need ema path that includes exactly strong10strong nodesem. Butli liEach node has an attribute, lets say its color. Each node has one of strong20strong different possible colors.li liThe path Im trying to find is the shortest path with exactly strong10strong nodes, where each node is a different color. I dont want any of the nodes in my path to have the same color as any other node.li liItd be nice to be able to force my path to have one value for one of the attributes at least one node must be blue, for instance, but thats not really necessary.li ol  pThis is a simplified example. My full data set actually has three different attributes for each node that must all be unique, and I have 2k nodes each with an average of 35 outgoing edges. Since getting a perfect shortest path may be exponential or factorial time, an exhaustive search is really not an option. What Im really looking for is some emapproximationem of a good path that meets the criterion under 3.p  pCan anyone point me towards an algorithm that I might be able to use even modifiedp  hr  pSome stats on my full data setp  ul liTotal nodes 2430li liTotal edges 86524li liNodes with no incoming edges 19li liNodes with no outgoing edges 32li liMost outgoing edges 42li liAverage edges per node 35.6 in each directionli liDue to the nature of the data, I know that the graph is acyclicli liAnd in the full data set, Im looking for a path of length 15, not 10li ul

Negative 1759 pBasically, if two strings would evaluate as the same in my database Id also like to be able to check that at the application level.  For example, if somebody enters bjork in a search field, I want PHP to be able to match that to the string Bjrk just as MySQL would.p  pIm guessing PHP has no direct equivalent to MySQLs collation options, and that the easiest thing to do would be to write a simple function that converts the strings, using strtolower to make them uniformly lowercase and strstr to replace multibyte characters with their corresponding ASCII equivalents.p  pIs that an accurate assumption  Does anybody have a foolproof array handy to use as the second parameter of strstr for conforming strings as various MySQL collations would do specifically for my current needs, utf8generalci  Or, lacking that, where could I find documentation of exactly how the different collations in MySQL treat various characters  I saw somewhere that in some collations  is treated as S and in others as Ss, for instance,  but it didnt outline every character evaluation.p

Negative 1759 pIm trying to combine a border on an UIView with a line drawn in drawRect. I use for both the same width.

Negative 1759 pI have the following setupp  ul liJPA 2.0 through Hibernate 4.1li liInfinispan as 2nd level cache 5.1li liHibernate Search connected to Hibernate 4.1li liInfinispan as Directory for Hibernate Search Luceneli liConnected a JDBC CacheStore for the Infinispan Directoryli liPostgreSQL 9.1 database to store both entities and Lucene directory.li liBitronix 2.1.2 as Transaction Managerli liIm not using Java EE, but Spring 3.1li ul  pInfinispan as Second Level Cache is fine, no recovery is needed and you can read changes in your own transaction because of the nature of the Cache.p  pAfter hours reading source codes, when I update an Entity, Hibernate Search does not update the Lucene Directory but at the end of the transaction if it commits, so it I wanted to do a search of the text Ive just updated, inside the same transaction, wouldnt I be ablep  pBut moreover, Hibernate Search does the updates to the Directory in a different thread, after transaction completion. So if one of the Directory Updates fails, then Lucene will be inconsistent to my entities And if something happened before the updates were dispatched to the Directory and a recovery was needed, would those updates be lostp  pAssuming this first transaction committed successfully, the updates were sent to the Infinispan Directory. A new transaction would be started here. By whom Lucene has the options to send the updates using JMS. Lets say that option is activated, so the JMS message initializes the new transaction.p  pInfinispan will modify its memory directory with the updates it receives, but the persistent CacheStore will again be updated at this transaction completion, after commit. Therefore there is a chance that if something happens while updating the jdbc CacheStore, it will be left with no updates, but Infinispan Memory Directory will have them applied.p  pMy question is, considering that all the modules Im using support transactions, and that they even  support joining to global transactions XA, emis there a way to achieve true transactionalityem Maybe Im just not seeing it.p

Negative 1759 pI am using a ScrollView to hold and display a static map image, which is 480 px x 904 px in size, and is implemented so that I can scroll up and down to view the map. I have implemented so that the ScrollView should fit and fill the screen. The static map is a 9patch image with only the right edge allowed to stretch. On the static map, I have overlaid map pins at specific locations using ImageButtons that are defined programatically. I have noticed that if I test with a specific AVD HVGA for instance and have all the map pins located at the exact locations, once I switch the same emulator to a different resolution WVGA for instance, all the pins will be off. Thw way I define the location of each map pin is that I first experiment with each individual ImageButton view with the emulator at HVGA so that I know the proper dpi values that will produce the perfect location in the emulator. The ImageButtons are then created and placed dynamically in java which requires pixel unit, and I have use proper dpi to pixel conversion code to be sure that the correct pixel unit can be calculated based on the screen density. The placement of the map pin is based on the setMargin call by moving the pin x pixels from the left edge and y pixels down from the top edge. Not sure if this is the proper way to define location of an imagebutton, but I thought the dpi to pixel conversion will take care of the transformationp  pHere is my xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidididrlayoutResultMap     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent     androidorientationvertical     androidpadding0dp gt      ltScrollView         androidididscrollResultMap         androidfillViewporttrue          androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent         androidlayoutalignParentToptrue         androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue         androidscrollbarsnone gt          ltRelativeLayout             androidididrlayoutScrollMap             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightfillparent gt              ltImageView                 androidididimgResultMap                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightfillparent                 androidlayoutalignParentToptrue                 androidsrcdrawablemapbase                  androidscaleTypefitXYgt         ltRelativeLayoutgt     ltScrollViewgt      ...  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pAnd here is the relevant portion of the java codep  precodepublic void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.resultmap       Get the array of map pin locations in pixel unit code is listed below     mapLocArray  getMapCoordinates      ...

You know how some apps maybe you have to type in a city or country, but the user might not be able to fully spell it, so based on your codeUISearchBarcode results, it presents a TableView with the suggested cities. So say I am about to write Singapore, I dont know how it is spelled. So I writep  pSingp  pAnd BAM, a UITableView below pops up with different optionscell titles, including a cell that suggests Singapore.

Negative 1759 pIn a certain view I have a bunch of AVAudioPlayer properties, each one is supposed to be played upon a certain user action. While the selected AVAudioPlayer is played, if another AVAudioPlayer was played  it should stop.p  pTo manage that, Ive created an Array that holds all the AVAudioPlayer properties and upon user selection, before playing the selected AVAudioPlayer, I wish to go over all the AVAudioPlayers and stop them.p  pThe problem is that the reasonable place to create the Array is at the beginning lets say, in ViewDidLoad and at this point none of the AVAudioPlayer properties went through allocinit  so if I look at the Array in the debugger it shows as empty number of objects  0. Currently, I do the allocinit action only when the user is actually selecting a certain AVAudioPlayer.p  pI can do allocinit for all the AVAudioPlayers at the beginning as well, but that will take resources that are not necessarily required.p  pIs there a way to create this Array without taking the required resources i.e. create the array with empty objects and later have them be allocated and initiated p

Negative 1759 pI am facing a very inconsistent problem at the moment. Basically, I have a browser detection routine in my application, which will sniff useragent on any incoming request and if it is coming from a supported browser then it will continue loading the application. But if it is not a supported one then it will redirect to Notsupported.html.p  pWhen I wrote this code couple of months ago. it was working great on my machine. I turned it in and it is working great on Dev Server. Great on Test server. no one ever saw n issue with this.p  pNow, once it is ported to live environment, sometimes it loads browsernotsupported page when user loads it for the first time and users machine has been idle for a while. Sometimes it does not to be sitting idle for a while. It just happens randomly but ocurances are noticed more often after machine has been sitting idle for a while or machine just restarted. But it is not guaranteed that it will happen for sure.p  pI am pretty sure that Production has many settings that are different than other environments but I have no idea why it would fail to detect the browser in production machine and not anywhere else. I am trying to reproduce issues but it is completely not repeatable.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1759 pOf what use is this APIp  pI adopted it a few months ago with the thought in mind that I could use it to trap both keyboard and mouse actions in a ComboBox to invoke business logic once the user made a selection.  As a developer, I went along, using the mouse only, blissfully ignorant, thinking my solution good, until the tester got involved and actually tried to use the combo box with the keyboard.  It seems that itemStateChanged has a very counterintuitive to me anyway sense of what it means to change the item state.  p  pWhen used with a mouse, the user can move over the droplist, with the mouse, with the droplist highlighting the combo box entry that currently contains the mouse cursor but without generating the event.  The event is generated when the user actually clicks on an item.  This is very intuitive and what I would expect. p  pOn the other hand, with the keyboard, every press of the downarrow causes an itemStateChanged event to be generated.  This is counterintuitive and not what I want.  I want to generate an event only when the user singals his choice by pressing the Enter key signalling that the choice has been made  i.e. the analogue of the mouse click, not of the mouse move.  Is there a way to make the combo box behave in this way or can I not use itemStateChanged for trapping these eventsp  pI should add, also, that the ItemEvent itself contains nothing that would help me disambiguate the situation.p  pUpdate OK, this is the nub of the issue  How can I make Swing treat downarrowing through the drop list of a combo box as the equivalent of moving the mouse through the elements of the drop list  Both ItemListener and ActionListener consider the arrowkey action a selection rather than a navigation.  Whereas I want the keyboard to be analogous to the mouse.  Our requirement is to make everything work with the keyboard.  The mouse is a nicetohave that experienced users of this application wont use much.p

Negative 1759 pI have two questions.  The first is a basic one.  MiniTest is a dropin replacement for UnitTest.  So if you use generators in rails, you get a bunch of ActiveSupportTestCase classes.  If you use minitest without minitestspecrails then you can dop  precode1.mustequal 1  instead of  assertequal 1, 1 codepre  pCorrect  So its confusing to me why theres a MiniTestUnitTestCase class as described in railscast 327 pro episode paywall sry.  Its confusing when looking at a test suite which Im actually using.  If minitest is a dropin replacement then Im using minitest to execute testunit style rails tests.  If I take it out, Im using testunit to run testunit testsp  pSo lets say I am using MiniTest to run TestUnit style tests.p  precoderequire testhelper class FooTest lt ActiveSupportTestCase end codepre  pAfter watching destroyallsoftwares screencast on extracting domain objects, I was inspired.  He makes some good points about avoiding loading testhelper.rb to speed up the test suite without resorting to spork trickery which is exactly what I do.  But how can I avoid loading testhelper.rb when thats what gives me ActiveSupportTestCase from abovep  pCan you not extract domain objects and put them in lib or extras with MiniTest or TestUnitp

Negative 1759 pI have created a plugin that calculates the intersections between grids. The coordinates from the intersection calculation are using the basepoint position as the origin of the coordinates. I want to convert the coordinates to the Survey Point position. I tried to fetch the coordinates of the base point with this code p  precodeElementCategoryFilter filter  new ElementCategoryFilterBuiltInCategory.OSTProjectBasePoint  FilteredElementCollector collector  new FilteredElementCollectordoc IListltElementgt elements  collector.WherePassesfilter.ToElements  foreach Element element in elements      double x  element.getParameterBuiltInParameter.BASEPOINTEASTWESTPARAM.AsDouble     double y  element.getParameterBuiltInParameter.BASEPOINTNORTHSOUTHPARAM.AsDouble     double elevation  element.getParameter  BuiltInParameter.BASEPOINTELEVATIONPARAM.AsDouble  codepre  pI wanted to use the basepoint coordinates to adjust the coordinates i found in my intersection calculation to use the Survey Point as a origin. But i cant figure how to use the values from basepoint to adjust the coordinates. It seems the values in basepoint is not using survey point as origin, but maybe the internal coordinates. Or maybe i misunderstood the values in basepoint. Any pointers to what i can try  p

Negative 1759 pIm using Caliburn Micro to create a Visual Studio style interface for my application. p  pThe user could have multiple errors in multiple windows which are all shown on an errors view which is docked at the bottom of my application. Ive managed to implement a nice notification mechanism so that when changes are made to any document, the errors VM is notified and queries the source object.p  pIm having trouble, however, in figuring out how to get a doubleclick to navigate to the source of the error. p  pImagine I have bound description to a textbox on my document view and this provides a description is required validation message. Double clicking the message should navigate the user to the document in question and focus on the textbox.p  pThe validation objects that provide the messages already contain a reference to the viewmodel as an codeIViewAwarecode interface which allows me to call codeGetViewcode to get a reference to the view. Ive tried using this approach to enumerate the bindings on my view and find the controls that are bound to a particular property, though this is very slow and more of a brute force  pot luck approachp  pDoes anyone have any recommendations on approaches to this problem My only other thought is to pass responsibility of the focus action to the view itself and have that decide how to handle a request for navigation to a certain property  maybe using attached properties to identify particular controls by a unique property identifier. The application could cache this list in a dictionary to make things quicker all the processing done up front as the app is loadingp  pI assume Visual Studio implements this quite easily for the standard code editor window, since it just needs a line number to jump to the right place..p

Negative 1759 pIve discovered that when running a Java program in Mac OS X, text field objects e.g. JField support cut, copy, and paste operations using the system clipboard if you use the key commands without you having to do an extra coding. For instance, I can create a JField, type in some text, select it, and then use CommandC to copy it, then paste it in another application. The same works for pasting text copied from other applications.p  pI really like that Java does this automatically, but I notice that the Edit menu doesnt appear automatically with the cut, copy, and paste menu items. Is there any way to automatically add these menu items for accessing the system clipboard when text is selected If not, whats the best way to implement them so that it behaves like any other application. At this point, Im only interested in copy and pasting text.p  pAlso, I know that the system clipboard is platform specific. Does this automatic system clipboard functionality for text field objects occur on other platforms p  pEDIT I was actually wanting to know about adding this to the menu bar, but there wound up being such a great answer to the next question I would have had that I decided that Id select it as the right answer and rename the question.p

The problem is somewhere in the RenderToSurface reset andor the texturesurface.p  pI use the RenderToSurface like thisp  precodertHelper.BeginScenertSurface, new Viewport0, 0, this.owner.ClientSize.Width, this.owner.ClientSize.Height      Device.ClearClearFlags.Target  ClearFlags.ZBuffer, FogColor, 1, 0     terrainEffect.BeginPass0     RenderTiles     terrainEffect.EndPass  rtHelper.EndSceneFilter.None codepre  pIs it even possible Is it a bug in SlimDX What can I do  Can I maybe access the unmanaged resources somehow, and destroy them manuallyp  pPlease help, I have no idea what to do next.

Negative 1759 pI created a class codeSYFactorycode which contains a variety of class methods used to assemble objects mostly codeUIViewcodes and codeUIControlcodes.  These class methods are called by a codeUIViewControllercode object or more precisely, by an instance of a codeUIViewControllercode subclass called codeSYViewControllercode.p  pI am trying to add a selector to a codeUIControlcode object created by codeSYFactorycode, with the target set as the instance of codeSYViewControllercode.p  pThus in codeSYFactorycodep  precode UIControlreplyPaneWithWidthFromParentUIView parent selectorTargetid target  ...

I do not know why, since I pass the codeSYViewControllercode object as an argument in codereplyPaneWithWidthFromParentparent selectorTargettargetcode.p  pFor some odd reason, the codeUIControlcode object believes that the message ought not be sent to the codeSYViewControllercode object and tries sending it to an object of a different class instead.  Weird, rightp  pAny suggestionsp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo, right after posting the question I figured out what the problem was yet another proof that writing things down helps to think them throughp  pThe codeSYViewControllercode object was created in a local variable inside of a codeforcode loop.  There being no further references to the object, once the codeforcode loop terminated the codeSYViewControllercode object was destroyed by ARC.p  pFaced with a nonexisting target, the codeUIControlcode object tried to find an object in the responder chain that it thought most likely would answer the message.  That object was of class codeSYFixedMarginViewcode, thus the error messagep  precode Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason [SYFixedMarginView showTheVideoPane] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1f877d60 codepre  pSo the fix is simple.  I assigned the view controller to a codestrongcode property in addition to the local variable in the codeforcode loop.p  pHope others dont fall into the same trap.p

Negative 1759 pI have a question. There may be a very simple solution to this question but I am not able to figure it out yet. If I use a property say codepropertynonatomic, retainUIView mainViewcode. p  pNow I synthesize it in .m file and release it in the dealloc method as followingp  precode voiddealloc     [mainView release], mainView  nil    [super dealloc]  codepre  pThen in my codeviewDidLoadcode, Im allocating it and adding it as the subview of my codeself.viewcode like followingp  precode void viewDidLoad     mainView  [[UIView alloc] init]   .   .   .   [self.view addSubView mainView]  codepre  pNow I understand that at this point my codemainViewcode would have 3 reference counts one from alloc, one because its a retained property, and the third one when I added it to codeself.viewcode, its parent controller would own it too. Now, my question is if after adding my view to self.view, I release my mainView using p  precode[mainView release] codepre  pMy app crashes when I go back to the previous view as I am sending release to already deallocated object. Now my question is how am I overreleasing my view here. what am I missing because when I use following code it works fine and no crashes occur.p  precode void viewDidLoad    UIView newView  [[UIView alloc] init]   self.mainView  newView   [newView release]   .   .   .   [self.view addSubView mainView]  codepre  pI know why this second viewDidLoad method works but what I dont know is why first one fails, I am supposed to release my view after adding it to self.view.

Negative 1759 pIve seen a few similar questions to this issue Im having, but they all dont seem to work out.p  pI currently have a method that populates an arraylist with items from a database query, and then returns the arraylist to be used to populate a ComboBox.

However, VMM 2012 SP1 attempts to migrate multiple VMs at a time tofrom Server 2008R2 hosts, which cant support more that 1 in amp 1 out migration at once. Thusly, the migrations fail, and VMM will try to reexecute another group of migrations. Essentially, VMM gets stuck in a failure loop. The script avoids that by programmatically only migrating one VM at a time.pli ol

Negative 1759 pHeres something to bake everyones noodle.  I have a form on a website.  You can look at it a hrefhttpclaygarland.comcalendar relnofollowMy Websitea.  Click book me and select a certain number of days at the top right.  Manually remove a few of the form lines from the form using the  button.  Then try to use the first input on the first line.  Its linked to the wrong input.  All the inputs have unique ID attributes, and I rebind datetimepicker class after a line is removed.  Anyone have the foggiest idea why the datetimepicker pointing the the wrong object  Ironically enough, the timepicker portion, which is not from jQuery UI proper, still points to the correct input, it would seem.  It seems that when you delete lines of a lower number, the lines of a higher number are moved and renamed, but the date portion f the datetime picker is still pointing the the line number that it was originally bound to, if that makes any sense.p  pHelp is appreciated because this one has me stumped.  Ive tried manually releasing the datepicker objects before I remove the form lines, but nothing seems to help.p  pThanksp  pEdit Is there a way to completely destroy the instances of the datepicker that are bound to the input elements before I remove themp  pEdit Alright, I just had a realization.  I am destroying the datepickers on the lines Im removing, but not the lines that remain, so Im going to work on this for a minute and see if destroying the datepickers completely when i rebuild the form helps.p

Negative 1759 pIm trying to figure out what kind of iOS user interface elements I should be using to create this interfacep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8eYee.png altios interfacep  pAt the bottom of this view, there is a list of items.  This list of items can be arbitrarily long.  As such, and because of the standard detail disclosure indicator and so on, it makes sense that this is a tableview.p  pHowever, the items at the top are not tableview cells.  The obvious answer then, is to simply place a tableview on the view, i.e. an embedded tableview.  But this leads to another obvious issue, which is that this entire view should be scrollable  there will be a button for Add Item underneath the list of items which you will need to be able to scroll to, and the interface will be crappy if the whole view doesnt scroll.p  pSo, I could make it so the tableview is not scrollable, and is just as tall as it needs to be to include as many items as it needs to.  Then, the entire view is embedded in a scrollview, and scrolls properly.  My concern with this relates to memory management, if I do this, I dont think Ill be taking advantage of the dynamic cell creation that is inherently part of a scrollable tableview, and will instead have dozens or even hundreds of cells instantiated when the view loads.p  pAnother alternative would be to make the entire interface a tableview, with the top portions, and the bottom button, implemented as custom tableview cells that are different from the cells that show items.  In the past, however, Ive found that this is a painintheass too, but perhaps its a pain I must endure.p  pIn general, I feel like Im missing an obvious approach here, since this seems like it ought to be extremely simple to implement, but Im currently at a loss.  Help is appreciatedp

On my Raspi it turned out to be event0 while True     r,w,x  select[dev], [], []     for event in dev.read          The event.code for a scroll wheel event is 8, so I do the following         if event.code  8             printevent.value codepre  pIm now going to test this on my raspi and see how that works. Thanks for all the inspiration guys and girlsp
Negative 1759 pI have a website with multiple tabs. Each tab runs a separate report based on a set of filters that take their values from session variables.p  pstrongHow things work nowstrongp  pWhile the user is inside a report tab they can open a filter menu to select the options that they need to run their report doctor names, locations, date, etc and then they can hit the run button to get their report. When the user clicks run the form is saving the variables inside the session where they are available to run other reports without having to click run or define them again and again.p  pstrongWhat I am trying to dostrongp  pInstead of having only a run button inside the form I need an Apply button that will set the session variables from the form without running the current report. This way the user can predefine their variables without being forced to run a report they dont need.p  pI tried using ajax that calls a function outside my application which is setting up variables based on the users selection.p  pMy challenge is to get those variables back from the function in some format where I could use them in updating the current session variables.p  pstrongThis is a sample of my codestrongp  pThe Apply buttonp  precodelta href idokbutton classsavebuttons closerevealmodal onclicksetSessiongtApplyltagt codepre  pMy Ajax Functionp  precodefunction setSession     var formData  form.serialize      .ajax         urlmodexamplecomponentsexampleCFCsxUtility.cfcmethodsetSessionVariables,         data formData        codepre  pAnd part of my functionp  precodeltcfcomponent outputnogt     ltcffunction namesetSessionVariables accessremote returntypeanygt         ltcfargument namedocid typestring requirednogt          ltcfif isDefineddocidgt             ltcfset session.doctorids  docidgt         ltcfifgt          ltcfif isDefineddocidgt              ltcfreturn session.doctoridsgt         ltcfelsegt             ltcfreturn 0gt         ltcfifgt      ltcffunctiongt ltcfcomponentgt codepre  pWhat I need is to get the value of codesession.doctoridscode to be able to update my session variables with the new value.p

However, when the script relies on parameters in the main function eg codeargccode, codeargvcode, the debugger seems to ignore both parameters and treat them as though they are uninitialized.p  pFor instance, in the following code, the output is always codeprintfUsage find patternncode. p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt define MAXLINE 1000  int getlinechar line, int max   find print lines that match pattern from 1st arg  mainint argc, char argv[]      char line[MAXLINE]     int found  0      if argc  2         printfUsage find patternn     else         while getlineline, MAXLINE gt 0             if strstrline, argv[1]  NULL                  printfs, line                 found                  systemPause     return found   int getlinechar s, int lim      int c     char i  s      while lim gt 0 ampamp cgetchar  EOF ampamp c  n         s  c     if c  n         s  c     s  0     return si  codepre  pHow can I run the code such that argc and argv get used Should I perhaps be using an IDE other than Visual Cp

Negative 1759 pOne of my current endeavors is creating a 2D destructible terrain engine for iOS Cocos2D See a hrefhttpsgithub.comcrebstarPWNDestructibleTerrain relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcrebstarPWNDestructibleTerraina . It is in an infant stages no doubt, but I have made significant progress since starting a couple weeks ago. However, I have run into a bit of a performance road block with calculating surface normals.p  pNote For my destructible terrain engine, an alpha of 0 is considered to not be solid ground. p  pThe method posted below works just great given small rectangles, such as n lt 30. Anything above 30 causes a dip in the frame rate. If you approach 100x100 then you might as well read a book while the sprite attempts to traverse the terrain. At the moment this is the best I can come up with for altering the angle on a sprite as it roams across terrain to get the angle for a sprites orientation just take dot product of 100  normal  1,0 vector.p  precodeCGPointgetAverageSurfaceNormalAtCGPointpt withRectCGRectarea   float avgX  0 float avgY  0 ccColor4B color  ccc40, 0, 0, 0 CGPoint normal float len  for int w  area.size.width w gt area.size.width w      for int h  area.size.height h gt area.size.height h          CGPoint pixPt  ccpw  pt.x, h  pt.y         if [self pixelAtpixPt colorCacheampcolor]              if color.a  0                  avgX  w                 avgY  h               end inner if           end outer if       end inner for   end outer for  len  sqrtfavgX  avgX  avgY  avgY if len  0      normal  ccpavgX, avgY  else      normal  ccpavgXlen, avgYlen   end if  return normal   end get codepre  pMy problem is I have sprites that require larger rectangles in order for their movement to look realistic. I considered doing a cache of all surface normals, but this lead to issues of knowing when to recalculate the surface normals and these calculations also being quite expensive also how large should the blocks be. Another smaller issue is I dont know how to properly treat the case when length is  0.p  pSo I am stuck... Any advice from the community would be greatly appreciated Is my method the best possible one Or should I rethink the algorithm I am new to game development and always looking to learn new tips and tricks.p

Negative 1759 pIve seen the issue many times, where people need the view to stay put after translating it in an animation.  The fix is simple just add fillAftertrue and fillEnabledtrue to the XML.p  pThis works, and the view does stay put after the animation.  However, upon calling the animation again, the view resets to the original point and simply moves to the same spot.p  pFor instance, say my view is at 0,0 and I call this animation by clicking a buttonp  precodeltset xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidfillAftertrue     androidfillEnabledtrue gt      lttranslate         androidduration100         androidfromXDelta0         androidfromYDelta0         androidtoXDelta20         androidtoYDelta20 gt     lttranslategt ltsetgt codepre  pIt moves from 0,0 to 20,20 as expected.  However, if I hit the button again and call the same animation, it magically jumps back to 0,0 and translates to 20,20 all over again.p  pWhat if I want it to do the same translation, but originating from the new spot  So I hit the button once, it goes from 0,0 to 20,20.  I hit it again, it goes to 40,40, then 60,60, and so on.p  pIs there a simple way to do that in the XML, or am I going to need to create some variable that updates itself constantly upon each motion something like STARTLOCATIONp  pAt that point, would it just make sense for me to do this all right in the Java and forget the XML  I actually quite like how compact and simple the XML is compared to the Java, but Ill begrudgingly switch over if I have to.p  pEDIT I just had a smart idea, and removed fromXDelta0 and YDelta as well, since I imagined if you only give it the toXDelta then it wont care where it starts from.  It is a delta, after all, which we all know means change, regardless of origin.  But that did nothing.  Sadface.p

Negative 1759 pI have a static library that i can build in both Debug and NonDebug mode. I wish to use the Debug version in an RTP when i build the RTP with the Debug Mode option. I wish to use the Non Debug version in an RTP when i build the RTP with out the Debug option. All i can find, is to put the library name with the full path in the Library tab of the RTP project. The path contains the Debug directory. I have to manually change it to NonDebug when i change the build. I am looking for how to setup the project file to automatically select the appropriate path based on having Debug Mode checked or not. Thanksp

Negative 1759 pWorking with Angularjs for the first time. MVC 4, VS 2012p  pI have an angular function AddRealTimeAlert which can add an alert nicely formatted div...not a generic js alert box to be displayed to the user.  If the function is called using the button see html below, addAlertButton, the function works perfectly.  However, if the function is called by a script tag from the same html file or a different html file, it breaks.  Specifically, angular.elementalertsController.scope returns null.  However, angular.elementalertsController does not return null it returns the div.  So that scope method doesnt seem to work unless its called from clicking the button.

Negative 1759 pSo, Im trying to implement Lua as a scripting language in C. Its simple enough, really, if you use it as part of a console application. But I want to be able to create a game console within XNA. The problem is that Lua.DoString seems to return a console line, rather than a string  which, as I said, is fine for console applications, but I want to add it to an output buffer as a string so I can display it ingame, rather than in a console window. I apologize if this is confusing  hopefully the code will clear it up.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using LuaInterface  namespace LuaConsoleLibrary      public class LuaConsole              private Lua lua          private bool isRunning  true         private string input         private Listltstringgt outputBuffer          public bool IsRunning                      get  return isRunning                    public LuaConsole                      this.lua  lua                   public void Run                      int i  0             whileisRunning                              outputBuffer.Addgt                   input  Console.ReadLine                 outputBuffer.Add                  try                                      lua.DoStringinput                                  catchException e                                      outputBuffer.Adde.Message                                  finally                                      outputBuffer.Add                                              codepre  pBasically, Im confused as to why codelua.DoStringinputcode should work as opposed to having to use codeConsole.WriteLinelua.DoStringinputcode. Ive even tried codeoutputBuffer.Addlua.DoStringinput.ToStringcode, which, being that ToString is valid there, should work in theory. Instead it performs codelua.DoStringcode and then throws an exception  Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Unless Im mistaken, the object in question is codeLuacode, which makes codeluacode a valid object reference. Anyway, seeing as these two solutions dont work, I was wondering if anyone knows enough about LuaInterface to suggest an alternative way to get the same result. I essentially want something to the effect of codeoutputBuffer.Addlua.DoStringinputcode. By the way, the Lua command Ive been using to test this is codeprinttestcode  maybe codeprintcode is somehow returning a console line instead of a string, but I cant think of another way to return a string from Lua.p  pI apologize if my problem is rambling or poorly explained  I tried to be as concise as possible, but its kind of a niche issue and I dont know how else to explain it, really. Oh, and I did try Google, and I browsed all 65 or so LuaInterface questions on Stack Overflow, so Im 95 sure Ive done my due diligence before asking this question. LuaInterface is just not that wellknown of a tool, I guess.p
Negative 1759 pbr this is my first post here since most of the time I already found a suitable solution br However this time nothing seems to help properly.br br Im trying to migrate information from some mysql Database I have just readonly access to.br My problem is similar to this one bra hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7772913mysqlgroupbydoesntgivemethenewestgroupMySQL group by doesn39t give me the newest groupa br I also need to get the latest information out of some tables but my tables have 300k entries therefore checking whether the timeattributevalue is the same as in the subquery like suggested in the first answer would be too slow once I did ...

Negative 1759 pIm not finding a reference to Last so Ill ask what I hope is a fairly simple need to fulfill.  I have objects in a core data entity.  Currently I do not implement any sort of time stamp on this entity which would not help much anyway because the users travel coast to coast but I suppose I could always stamp in zulu time.p  pI need to retrieve the LAST object that was added to refer to an attributes value.  I know core data stores its own unique incrementing key but I dont know how to reference it.  I need to check to see if the odometer reading the user is trying to enter is less then the last one entered or varies beyond normal bounds to check for user input error before saving a new object and present an alertview if so.p  pI cant look for MAX because the user may have made an erroneous high entry prior. but I can deal with that issue separately once the user has determined he has made an invalid entry somewhere that needs to be addressed and dealt with accordingly.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1759 pI need to convert a floatingpoint number with system precision to one with a specified precision e.g. 3 decimal places for the printed output. The fprintf function will not suffice for this as it will not correctly round some numbers. All the other solutions Ive tried fail in that they all reintroduce undesired precision when I convert back to a float. For example p  precodefloat xfround1ffloat input, int prec       printfft,input     int trunc  roundinput  pow10, prec     printfft,floattrunc     inputfloattrunc  pow10, prec     printffn,input     return input   codepre  pThis function prints the input, the truncated integer and the output to each line, and the result looks like this for some numbers supposed to be truncated to 3 decimal placesp  p49.975002   49975.000000    49.974998p  p49.980000   49980.000000    49.980000p  p49.985001   49985.000000    49.985001p  p49.990002   49990.000000    49.990002p  p49.995003   49995.000000    49.994999p  p50.000000   50000.000000    50.000000p  pYou can see that the second step works as intended  even when trunc is cast to float for printing  but as soon as I convert it back to a float the precision returns. The 1st and 6th rows illustrate problem cases.p  pSurely there must be a way of resolving this  even if the 1st row result remained 49.975002 a formatted print would give the desired effect, but in this case there is a real problem. p  pAny solutions p

Negative 1759 pWe have a very odd but major issue with an internal web application. It is written in asp.net 4.0 and has been working fine for a while. However a few days ago it suddenly stopped working in IE10,9 and 8. On certain pages when clicking a button the page hangs for up to an hour. This does not happen in Opera, Chrome or Firefox, but it does happen in all current versions of IE. Some of the PCs have not been rebooted for months so we do not think it is due to an update to IE. Also if we deploy the application to a different server everything works fine for IE too..... It also does not happen when running the site from a development environment. So we have discovered that it only happens when the site is running on either the live server or the test server both almost identical but not quite and even then it only happens when accessing the site from IEp  pThe live and test servers are both win 2008 while the server that it does work on is win 2003 and my dev environment is on windows 7.p  pAnyone have any ideas about what might be going on or where we could start lookingp  pEDITp  pWe have discovered the root of the problem, although not why it is suddenly causing an issue. We have some buttons where a ClientSideOnClick event is added manually. This seems to cause two postback methods to be added to the button one manual and one automatic. If we do not add the manual event then everything works fine. Obviously we could turn off AutoEventWireup but then our pageload events etc would not be wired up properly and there are a lot of pages in this app to fix if we do that. Can we disable the autoeventwireup just for the buttonsp

I will not use an IOC container because I feel that it would complicate the API  usage.p  pThe project have 15 repositories and servicesp  pThe current design is as followsp  pService Layer A  Unit of work  Repository A and or Bbr  Service Layer B  Unit of work  Repository B and or A...br  ...p  precodepublic class ServiceA  IServiceA, IService      private readonly IUnitOfWork unitOfWork      public AssetServiceIUnitOfWork unitOfWork              this.unitOfWork  unitOfWork           ...      public IListltDomainObjectAgt GetAll              return unitOfWork.RepositoryA.GetAll           public void Dispose              unitOfWork.Dispose           ...   public class UnitOfWork  IUnitOfWork      private readonly MyDbContext context  new MyDbContext     private IRepositoryA repositoryA     private IRepositoryB repositoryB     ...      public IRepositoryA RepositoryA              get  return repositoryA  repositoryA  new RepositoryAcontext            public IRepositoryB RepositoryB              get  return repositoryB  repositoryB  new RepositoryBcontext            ...      public void Save              context.SaveChanges           public void Dispose              context.Dispose        public class RepositoryA  Repository, IRepositoryA      public RepositoryAMyDbContext context          basecontext       public IListltDomainObjectAgt GetAll              return context.tblA.ToList.Selectx gt x.ToDomainObject.ToList           ...  codepre  pSince this is an API that should be used by other projects, I need a nice and fairly easy to use interface for the user that consumes the API. Because of this the UnitOfWork is created in this public interface between the user and the service layer, see below.p  pI also think its best that the usingstatement lies within the API so that the dbcontext is disposed properly and immediately after each service call.p  pI started out using the Proxy pattern for this Examplep  precodepublic class ProxyA  Proxy, IServiceA      public IListltDomainObjectAgt GetAll              using var service  GetServiceltServiceAgt             return service.GetAll          ...   public abstract class Proxy      protected T GetServiceltTgt where T  IService             return TActivator.CreateInstancetypeofT, new object[]  new UnitOfWork       codepre  pBut this would require me to create a proxy for each service. I could of course skip the service interface in the proxy and create a common proxy which handles all the services.p  pIve also looked at the Facade pattern but cant decide which pattern to use for this particular scenario.p  pMy questionsbr  Is this a good approach or are there any other design patterns that will solve this problemp  pAlso, should there be one public API entry point or several, grouped by some business logicp

Negative 1759 pI mucked around with TFS settings and I accidentally included the bin and obj folders for TFS 2012 checkin, and even checked them in already. I dont want this because these files change often and arent meant for inclusion.p  pIve checked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13765372whathappenedtoexcludefromsourcecontrolinvs2012What happened to quotExclude from Source Controlquot in VS2012a. The accepted answer doesnt work because the bin amp obj folders and the DLLs inside those folders dont appear in the Promote Candidate Changes list, even after excluding them. The second most popular answer also doesnt work permanently. I press yes to all and it removes them from the included changes list, but when I do any action involving rebuilding, theyre added to include list again.p  pIm looking for a permanent solution which will permanently exclude these folders and the files inside from checkin, and if possible also removes them from the TFS server.p

Negative 1759 pI am currently writing some code for a sample sequencer in Android. I am using the AudioTrack class. I have been told the only proper way to have accurate timing is to use the timing of the AudioTrack. EG I know that if I write a buffer of X samples to AudioTrack playing at a rate of 44100 samples per second, that the time to write will be 144100X secs.p  pThen you use that info to know what samples should be written when.p  pI am trying to implement my first attempt using this approach. I am using only one sample and am writing it as continuous 16th notes at a tempo of 120bpm. But for some reason it is playing at a rate of 240bpm.p  pFirst I checked my code to derive the time of a 16th nanoseconds note at tempo X. It checks outs.p  precodeprivate void setPeriod      periodint1doubleTEMPO601000     periodperiod10000004     Log.itest,String.valueOfperiod  codepre  pThen I verified that my code to get the time for my buffer to be played at 44100khz in nanoseconds and it is correct.p  precodelong bufferTime1000000000SAMPLERATEbuffSize codepre  pSo now I am left thinking that the audio track is playing at a rate that is different from 44100. Maybe 96000khz, which would explain the doubling of speed. But when I instantiate the  audioTrack, it was indeed set to 44100khz.p  pfinal int SAMPLERATE is set to 44100p  precodebuffSize  AudioTrack.getMinBufferSizeSAMPLERATE, AudioFormat.CHANNELOUTMONO,              AudioFormat.ENCODINGPCM16BIT     track  new AudioTrackAudioManager.STREAMMUSIC, SAMPLERATE,              AudioFormat.CHANNELOUTMONO,              AudioFormat.ENCODINGPCM16BIT,              buffSize,              AudioTrack.MODESTREAM codepre  pSo I am confused as to why my tempo is being doubled.

Negative 1759 pSo I made this simple website with html and javascript where the user enters their loose change and it converts it all into a final dollar amount. For some really weird reason, tons of decimal places are added when the nickels and dimes are certain amounts, for example when nickels is 8. Also, even when those decimal places are not like that, the total amount has long decimal places as well. Since none of the calculations should ever go beyond 2 decimal places, it has me kinda stumped. For my solution as you will see in the code, I simply round the number and because this page is for a course in programming and not in math, its not critical that I get it right for the assignment but I am curious as to why this is happening so that if I do ever create something serious in the future, I can avoid this type of issue.p  pYou can view this code in action here, codehttp192.236.14.50part4codep  pClick on Change Converter and enter values and hit convert.

Negative 1759 pI have a small java project on which I work together with a friend. We both use eclipse with the egit plugin and github for version management. p  pBesides the JRE library, we use the javafx and an RXTX library. As we both need the libraries, we put them in a lib folder in our project. Then we set up the .classpath to reference the libraries in our project and pushed the .classpath to github.p  pAt that point, we realized, that different computers need different libraries and that it may be a bad idea to have the .classpath file in the CVS.p  pSo my Question is, what is the best practice here Having the .classpath file commited seems like a bad idea, however I want to have control over the libraries which are used in the project, therefore It might be a good Idea to provide the library jars with the other project files someone who pulls the project can then easily add the jar for his system to the classpath. However, consequently I would have to provide the javafx and RXTX library for every system win32, win64, linux, ... , and that also does not seem like the best thing to do.p  pI feel like this may have been asked already, however I could not find a satisfying questionanswer for my problem.p

Negative 1759 pI have a page that is being populated by parsing information from a CSV file and then display it in list form. Once the list is populated, I am using the jQuery UI accordion to make it an accordion menu. My code looks like thisp  precode    document.ajaxCompletefunction         divaccordion gt ul.accordioncollapsible true, activefalse      codepre  pI have to wait until the ajax is complete or else there wont be any data to make into an accordion menu. I am then needed to apply click actions to these list items. When I click on the list item, it does an AJAX call and pulls in more data from that CSV. So Im essentially called an AJAX request within an ajaxComplete function.I cant use codewindow.loadcode here because the initial AJAX function is called asynchronously so that wouldnt work.p  pThe issue is that when I run use the click function it works and then the second I use it it runs twice and the third time it runs 4 times, etc. Im assuming this is because is running the ajax function and then running the ajaxcomplete function which contains the ajax function and it keeps multiplying.p  pI was trying to think of setting a hasRun variable to true and false but couldnt figure out how to incorporate it into the loop to stop it from running more than once.p  pAny ideas Thanks for your helpp

I also find it surprising that I could not find much material online addressing what seems to me to be a common case a final derived class calling virtual methods so I wonder if I am misusing virtual functions here or excessively optimizing. p  pHow should this be done Stop prematurely optimizing and stick with codefoocode, suck it up and use codeDerivedfoocode, or is there a better wayp
Negative 1759 pI have an HTML website with videos and custom video control buttons. When you hover over the playpause button for example, it uses CSS to change to a different photo of the play button with a different colour but if you are going over it for the first time since loading or reloading the page, it goes blank when you hover on it because it has to load the image that it changes to on hover. I found a way to preload images that have numeric names starting from one. I have a set of thumbnail images and they all have a number  mo.png as a name. It goes 1mo.png, 2mo.png and so on. I used this method to preload them all automaticallyp  precodeforvar x  1 x lt 5 x     no  x.toString     cs  img  no    new Image img  no  .src  media  no  mo.png     evalcs  codepre  pBut that only works for images that go from 1mo.png to 4mo.png the 4 can be changed based on how many pictures with mo at the end of their name I want to preload.p  pI want JavaScript to go through the images folder in my directory and using the same method I used for the mo images preload any images it finds with any random name. Pretty much all I need to know is how to get file names from a certain folder in my sites own directory and store them in an array or variables.p

However it seems that whenever I set emanythingem on the scope outside codelinkcode, it breaks the codewatchcode. codewatchcode always receives a codedatacode of undefined... and my scope.options are also undefined. Outside of the codewatchcode function codescope.optionscode is correct, but that doesnt help me much if I cant use them when the data is actually plotted.p  pIve had to resort to hard coding the options inside codelinkcode and commenting out the outer scope assignments. I have a bunch of different charts I need to create, all of which look differently. Id hate to have to hard code different options for EVERY one, but at the moment I dont see any other way to make this work. Is there some way I can access my other data attributes from the HTML inside the codewatchcode function without it breaking everythingp  pNote I tried codeattrs.optionscode, but that just gives me a line1.options string, and not the actual object.p  pEdit1p  pUpdated my code per ExpertSystems suggestions.

The text is basically Period of data used mmm dd to mmm dd I mention this to give an idea of the width required and where the text can be split if necessary.p  pOne method I considered was finding out a series of contiguous histogram bins where the freq y axis remains less than 90 of the maximum of all frequencies then, the text can be printed at the x position starting at the first of those bins near the top of the graph. p  pIs this a good way of going about it If so, how do I compute this contiguous series of bins without looping around p  pOr is there a better way of placing this text adaptively according to the data p  pEdit Due to other considerations, the number of histogram bins is not a fixed 50 any more, but rather codexmax20code where xmax is the maximum xaxis value. Algorithms that depend on working on aggregates of a number of bins might need to take this variability into account, when calculating that number. p

Negative 1759 pThis may be one of those brightblazingly obvious answers, but I cannot dig up the answer, despite plenty of Google milage.p  pI have a website that uses a webfont.

If you omit it, the webfont doesnt load.p  pI have a feeling that the problem is stemming from the fact that I have to use an absolute path on my webfont, and that absolute font uses codewwwcode. If I omit the codewwwcode, then the reverse problem exists. I cant use relative because the .htaccess buggers that obviously.p  pa hrefhttpwww.mousepawgames.com relnofollowThe website is herea.

Negative 1759 pMostly for fun, Ive decided to write my own minimal test framework for my C code. I use a basic codestructcode for the test information, create an array of test codestructcodes and then iterate over them to run all the tests. This amounts to a very small amount of work for a fairly elegant imho solution.p  pHowever, the one thing that is a little annoying is that I cannot figure out how to define functions as function pointers instead of defining the function and then creating a function pointer later.p  pI have the following which works just finep    pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodetypedef int  testp void  struct test      char  desc     testp func   int exampletest void      putsThis is a test     return 0   void runtest char  testname, testp test      printfTesting sttt[ PEND ]r, testname     char  testresult  test  FAIL  PASS     printfTesting sttt[ s ]n, testname, testresult   int main void      struct test testlist []            example test, testp exampletest            for  int i  0 i lt 1 i            runtesttestlist[i].desc, testlist[i].func           return 0  codepre  pHowever, I am hoping I can remove the need for the casting in the codestructcode and instead define the function as being a function pointer from the beginning.

Negative 1759 pIm using CSSBox to render a web page HTML and CSS and then print it. The application must deal with specific sites. The idea is to make some sites that arent designed to be printable actually print and look readable. This is done by removing menus, headers, etc. centering content, overriding some styles.p  pMy current approach is to render the site to a component that is part of the CSSBox API called BrowserCanvas. I adjust the width of the canvas for each supported site to ensure that paragraphs look good in each case. This BrowserCanvas descends from JPanel and has the paint methods that I use to render it to the printer Graphics object.p  pThe problem is that the printer canvas is usually huge, think 300 ppp, 600 ppp, etc. What Im done now is set a RenderingHints to force Bicubic interpolation to scale the document up to fill all space in the printed page.p  pThe problem is that you can see that the documents is like an up scaled screenshot, and does not look very good in the printed page.p  pIs there a better approachp  pstrongPrint Methodstrongp  pAccess to printer is obtained by the PrinterJob class.p  pThen I override the BrowserCanvas print method that accepts a page number. According to that number I set scale and translation on the graphic object, taking care that if the last line of text cannot fit entirely in the page it is moved to the next page. Then I call super.print passing as parameter the graphic object that has all the scaling and translation applied.p  pI thought the scaling would be soft, like doing everything happen at a higher resolution, like font sizes, but it looks more like draw everything in a base resolution then upscaling the result to the desired one.p  pExample of a modified page using the CSSBox documentation site for testingp  ppage 1 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtZM0M.png altout0.pngp  hr  ppage 2 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.complFyC.png altout1.pngp

Negative 1759 pWhen using union types with quite a few constructors I almost always find myself implementing lots of logic in single function, i.e. handling all cases in one function.

Negative 1759 pive been working on this for a while and cant seem to figure it out except that at some point it was working as was intended. I have two objects, a User which can be associatted with multiple addresses. Saving a new user and address together works just fine, but when i try to add a new address to an existing User i get an error about duplicate primary keys for User table. I guess it has something to do with the configuration in hibernate trying both unidirectional and bidirectional. p  pBelow are any relevant files.

Negative 1759 pI have a ASP.NET website hosted on azure. For performance testing i am doing some load test, and reading the performance counter. The problem is the Requests Failed counter value, it is showing always high value and never goes to 0.p  pDuring the load test, due to some wrong settings all of the requests failed.

Negative 1759 pI am currently developing a hybrid mobile app which makes use of codewebkitoverflowscrolling touchcode on the content area to provide smooth scrolling.p  pI have hit somewhat of a road block however when using this feature. Upon scroll I check with an code.onAnimationFramecode loop I check the .scrollTop position to see if any movement has occured so that I can let various components within the application know of this so they can perform certain actions Use case examples may be parallax scrolling, controlling culled rendering etc.. This is all well and good when testing in a desktop browser Ie. Chrome 41 however when debugging within iOS Safari OR iOS UIWebView the scrollTop position seems to be cached when there is a large amount of movement Eg. a user flicking the viewp  pThis caching means that other elements expecting to know the exact current scrollTop value will fall behind and the view becomes out of sync.p  pMy presumption is that overflow scrolling forces rendering onto the gpu so Im wondering if there is emanyem way to get around this or to force invalidation of the cached scrollTop value.p  pstrongDEMONSTRATIONstrong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netskpmkjea relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netskpmkjeaa load up in safari on an ios device and connect to debugger to see console log of scroll top positionsp  pThings Ive triedp  ul liForcing an empty element in and out of the root body to try and force a full page update to recalculate the scrollTop valueli liUsing a container div within the scroll element and checking for the bounding box updating code.getBoundingClientRectcode but this seems to have the same cached valuesli ul  pMore info Ill add more if it would help anyonep  ul liUIWebView build with Cordovali liMy main test target is iOS7li liThe issue exists but is much less noticeable ie. cached value invalidation appears to occur at intervals on android 4li ul

Negative 1759 pLight Table 0.7.2 running a live browser repl with clojurescript.p  pIm just documenting a solution to a problem that was blocking me from using Light Table.  I couldnt find any suitable answers, and it took a while for me to find a workaround.

In the second case I was unable to understand what the user meant by just not live evaling clojurescript namespaces in LightTable and relying on the browserDOM behavior for feedback as a workaround.p  pThe reason for me not using the main file of the project is I want to do some quick oneoffs in a separate repl.  This is something I am able to do under emacs.  Normally, under emacs, I will have the main cljs file, and then the ncider repl.  I will put both into the same namespace, so I can update the shared context from either buffer.  p
Negative 1759 pSo I have a small game so far where you build ships and attempt to destroy the enemy station. Everything works fine except for when more than one ship is firing at the station. What seems to happen or at least what I believe is that the code for setting the location of the bullet is occurring as many times as there are ships.

Negative 1759 pIn this documentation a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfragmentscommunicating.html relnofollowCommunicating with Other Fragmentsa, Google tells us that the best practice for communicating Activity and Fragment is to strongimplement an interfacestrong. This interface then can be called by Fragment and to execute necessary behaviour in Activity.p  pBut theres also a hack way to do this. Directly get the Activity by the method stronggetActivitystrong and then we can use all strongpublic methodstrong under it.p  pThis confuse me quite a lot. Cause I couldnt really think of any critical disadvantage of using the hack way to do this.p  pWhat the advantage of first approach came up in my head arep  ol liI can confine the strongresource accessibilitystrong under my Activity. But since the Fragment is able to call getActivity, then it can actually access all the public method in it. So this cant really convince me.li liMore readable and storytelling in the code. With the first approach, the code tells us that this Activity only open these specific accessible area for the Fragment. We can know What inside the Fragment may interfere the Activity directly strongby just looking the code in Activitystrong. Or else, we will need to open up the code under Fragment to see what it did.li ol  pAll right, after I summarise these out, I was a little bit convinced by myself. But frankly, I really want some other solid and must reason for doing this. Any idea or documentation would be really appreciatedp

Negative 1759 pIve seen other questions asked on the site inquiring as to whether or not it was acceptable practice to set a Scanner object as public or static to allow it to be used by multiple methods, and the consensus has been that it wasnt the worst thing you could do, but it was probably better to not do it in any large, complex program.p  pMy particular question pertains to a file scanner, which requires the whole throws exception clause that Im not entirely familiar with yet, still a beginner. I cant set it to static outside of the methods because as far as I know, the class itself cant throw exceptions. Is it acceptable to make it public in say, the main method Do I have any better alternativesp  pThe purpose of the program is to parse a complicated text file actually, a .lua file essentially storing a hierarchy of tables, and so Ive broken it up into several methods in my attempt to search for specific data within it and it shouldnt end up being longer than 200300 lines of code with 6 or so methods.p

Negative 1759 pOK, so I have a an Amazon S3 bucket to which I want to allow users to upload files directly from the client over https.p  pIn order to do this it became apparent that I would have to change the bucket name from a format using periods to a format using dashes. So p  pstrongmy.bucket.comstrongp  pbecame p  pstrongmybucketcomstrongp  pThis being required due to a limitation of https authentication which cant deal with periods in the bucket name when resolving the S3 endpoint.p  pSo everything is peachy, except now Id like to allow access to those files while hiding the fact that they are being stored on Amazon S3. p  pThe obvious choice seems to be to use Route 53 zone configuration records to add a CNAME record to point my url at the bucket, given that I already have the bucket.com domain p  pstrongmy.bucket.comstrong        strongCNAMEstrong        strongmybucketcom.s3.amazonaws.comstrongp  pHowever, I now seem to have hit another limitation, in that Amazon seem to insist that the name of the CNAME record must match the bucket name exactly so the above example will not work.p  pMy temporary solution is to use a reverse proxy on an EC2 instance while traffic volumes are low. But this is not a good or long term solution as it means that all S3 access is being funneled through the proxy server causing extra server load, and data transfer charges. Not to mention the solution really isnt scalable when traffic volumes start to increase.p  pSo is it possible to achieve both of my goals above or are they mutually exclusivep  pIf I want to be able to upload directly from clients over https, I cant then hide the S3 url from end users accessing that content and vice versap

Negative 1759 pIm porting an iOS app to Android and I was wondering how I can convert a specific region on the map to actual screen dimensions, which is what codeconvertRegiontoRectToViewcode does in iOS. I am using codecom.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragmentcode in Android, and Ive looked at the codeProjectioncode class, however, I couldnt find an exact equivalent, which will take a map region, and give me back a rectangle in screen coordinates. There is a version to map points to screen points, which leads me to the harder way of doing this yeah, I can imagine how to get it working with that too, but I was wondering if there is a method that makes life easier, in Android too. Is there something that Im missingp

Negative 1759 pBefore anyone says this has been answered, I couldnt find this anywhere, because im not using buffered images, im using g.drawRect... and so on... to draw my object, this is what I was told to do because im learning how to code right now. But for some reason, the screen keeps flickering, and I would like some help.p  pSo, im pretty new at coding, And I am trying to code a very simple bomberman game. And Im not using BufferedImages, im just using Graphics paint, to draw the character. And, when Im adding the KeyBinding, I use repaint to update the game when a key is pressed. But this is very buggy and it glitches and shows a blank screen when I hold down one of the buttons. I think this is due to me repainting it, but im not sure of how to go about fixing this. Here is some of the code I am using.p  precode    public static void leftGraphics g      bomberManLowerLeftg, 90  dx, 20  dy     bomberManBodyLeftg, 90  dx, 20  dy     bomberManFaceLeftg, 90  dx, 20  dy   public static void rightGraphics g      bomberManLowerRightg, 90  dx, 20  dy     bomberManBodyRightg, 90  dx, 20  dy     bomberManFaceRightg, 90  dx, 20  dy   public void paintGraphics g      if down          frontg      else if up          backg      else if left          leftg      else if right          rightg        public static void mainString[] args      Frame frm  new BomberMan     frm.setSize750, 750     frm.setVisibletrue     frm.addpanel     frm.setBackgroundColor.black   Override public void keyPressedKeyEvent e      int kCode  e.getKeyCode     if kCode  KeyEvent.VKD          System.out.printlnRight         dx  3         down  false         right  true         left  false         up  false         repaint      else if kCode  KeyEvent.VKA          System.out.printlnLeft         dx  3         down  false         right  false         left  true         up  false         repaint      else if kCode  KeyEvent.VKW          System.out.printlnUp         dy  3         down  false         right  false         left  false         up  true         repaint      else if kCode  KeyEvent.VKS          System.out.printlnDown         dy  3         down  true         right  false         left  false         up  false         repaint      else ifkCode  KeyEvent.VKSPACE         placeBomb  true         bombdx  dx         bombdy  dy         repaint        codepre  pI could really use some help with this, thanks.

Negative 1759 pIve encountered a strange bug when my software is being started as another user using CreateProcessAsUser API Environment.GetFolderPath static method returns empty string for LocalApplicationData special folder. This bug doesnt occur all the time, and cant really figure out the exact situation when it happens and why it happens. Could you tell me why this thing may happen and how can I fix itp  pstrongEDITstrong It seems that it was a problem in legacy code that calls CreateProcessAsUser. The code didnt create environment block for the new process, Ive added the calls to CreateEnvironmentBlock and DestroyEnvironmentBlock API and the problem doesnt appear anymore. Dont really know if it is the right solution, but it seems to work. What do you thinkp

Afterwards, when it reconnects to our SignalR hub, it attempts to connect to the parameterless Hub constructor instead of the constructor with one parameter that is setup via the NinjectDependecnyResolver.

Negative 1759 pIve seen people suggest that SQLite is a good option for running a test suite because its faster. This seems like a good thing, and I want faster tests. However, Im currently using Postgres because its what I use in production and it seems like a bad idea to have a test environment that differs from production in such a significant way.p  pGiven that I am using Rspec and Cucumber with Rails 4, is there any risk that switching my test suite to SQLite will cause errors to emerge, or maybe hide errors that I will not pick up Essentially, it it totally transparent from ActiveRecords point of view so that I can use it as a dropin replacementp  pI am not aware of any Postgresspecific code, although I am using some complex queries in places via scopes.p

Negative 1759 pWhile reading a hrefhttpsexploreflask.comconfiguration.html relnofollowexploreflask.coma, I learned that it is best practice to use two different config files, one for development and one for production. I dont understand whether to place the secret key inside of the development or production config.p  blockquote   pThe private nature of the instance folder makes it a great candidate for defining keys that you dont want exposed in version control. These may include your apps secret key or thirdparty API keys.p blockquote  pI suppose the secret key shouldnt be shared.

Negative 1759 pIs it possible to create a business rule where I can set the value for a textbox with multiple lines.

Negative 1759 pSo, I have a custom cell with 5 components on it. Two labels, two buttons, and a text view. I want to be able to segue from this cell to another screen. The segue has been set up, but when testing, I am only able to segue if you click on the cell in a place that isnt covered by an element. Since the text view is most of the cell, it is extremely hard to segue. How can I have it so if I click anywhere on the cell besides the two buttons of course it will segue p
Negative 1759 pI am currently doing work which programmatically attempts to manipulate PE files. The approach so far has been to parse out all the information headers, variables within the headers, etc from a raw array of bytes, representing the PE file. p  pAs a result of this I currently have approximately 70 variables each pointing to a different byte slice of the array, which represents data about the PE. The issue comes with trying to now manipulate the array, and change the file. p  pLets say I wish to insert  add data at an arbitrary point along the byte array. 35 variables are before it, while 35 variables are after the insertion point. The earlier variables will be unaffected. What is the best way to update these 35 variables their position has been offset by N bytesp  pCurrent information the variables have is a Their value at the location they are at typically a 4 byte little endian value, and b Their absolute offset from the beginning of the PE file.p  pCheers. p
Negative 1759 pIm trying to update a website to support modal windows now so they will work now that the window.showModalDialog is losing all support.p  pTo do this i have tried to use the jQuery UI function dialog with an iFrame in it. Using a function i found somewhere as a startingpoint i managed to get it so i only have to change one thing in all the modals used in the site, but what Im looking for is a way to not change anything in the modals. This because there are a lot of them and they use functions that use other functions that use showModalDialog and so on.p  pTo do this i need to be able to close the dialog with window.close, because thats how the old modals where closed. I managed to get it working with FF by overriding the window.close function but the problem is that I also need it to also work in IE, and in IE you cant override the function.p  pSo if anyone could help me i would be most grateful.p

Negative 1759 pI have a function that looks like thisp  precodey  a2b  c2d codepre  pI would like to approximate this function by training a neural network using backpropagation. The range of the variables codeacode, codebcode, codeccode and codedcode is currently indeterminate to me, so to begin with I assume that they are all in the range [0, 1]. Then I generate a training set by assuming a uniform distribution on the variables. After finding the right amount of hidden nodes and layers as well as good values of backpropagations learning rate and momentum, I can reach a low average error on a test set using this range. However, as soon as I change the range of the variables to something like [1, 1], the error increases a lot.  p  pIs it normal that I need to change the structure of the neural network see coment below and the parameters of backpropagation depending on the range of the variables I feed to the network Or may this have something to do with the nodes in the hidden layer having a sigmoid activation function p  pNote When the range of a variable is not [0, 1], I normalize it to that range so it will work with the sigmoid function. Also note that the function may not be codeycode is not necessary for answering the question, but gives some context.p

Negative 1759 pI frequently need to create table variables within procedures, to store the top 25 rows from a view for processing.p  pI need to store these small batches in variables temporarily, because Im performing numerous operations that modify data within the underlying tables, and some of these operations cause the rows to no longer appear within the view itself based on the view criteria this is by design.  p  pI need to keep the data around for the entire processing session, and I cant rely on the view itself to remain consistent through the operation.p  pThe problem is, since were doing this in many instances across multiple databases, if we ever make any changes to the columns in any of our views, the code becomes somewhat bugprone since we also have to make sure to modify the relevant table types as well  without making any typos or mistakes, or overlooking anything.p  pSo my question is, can we just declare table variables or table types, if necessary by just stating Match the current columns in this view  p  pThat would make things much easier, since it would automatically keep all relevant table variables in sync with the current layout of the views in question, and eliminate the headache that comes with trying to keep it all straight manually.p  pIf no such shortcut exists, then I guess well just have to create custom table types matching our views as needed, to at least keep it as centralized as possible.p

The strange part is that no error is returned and no data is added  p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltphp errorreporting1 inisetdisplayerrors, On gt ltphp servername  xxx username  xx password  xxx dbname  xxxx  try      dbh  new PDOmysqlhostservernamedbnamedbname, username, password      set the PDO error mode to exception     dbhgtsetAttributePDOATTRERRMODE, PDOERRMODEEXCEPTION echo Connected to databaseltbr gt      catchPDOException e          echo Connection failed  . egtgetMessage      sth  dbhgtprepareuse accessibilita gt ltphp switch GET[action]  case add switch GET[type]  case tages     error  array     nome  issetPOST[nome]          trimPOST[nome]       if emptynome          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire un nome.          cognome  issetPOST[cognome]          trimPOST[cognome]       if emptycognome          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire un cognome.          indirizzo  issetPOST[indirizzo]          trimPOST[indirizzo]       if emptyindirizzo          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire un indirizzo.          civico  issetPOST[civico]          trimPOST[civico]       if emptycivico          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire un numero civico.      citta  issetPOST[citta]          trimPOST[citta]       if emptycitta          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire una citta valida.          prov  issetPOST[prov]          trimPOST[prov]       if emptyprov          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire una provincia.          if emptyerror          stmt  dbhgtprepareINSERT INTO tagesromanome, cognome, indirizzo, civico, citta, prov             VALUES nome, cognome, indirizzo, civico, citta, prov stmtgtbindParamnome, nome stmtgtbindParamcognome, cognome stmtgtbindParamindirizzo, indirizzo stmtgtbindParamcivico, civico stmtgtbindParamcitta, citta stmtgtbindParamprov, prov      else        headerLocationtages.phpactionadd .           amperror . joinerror, urlencodeltbrgt          break  break case edit switch GET[type]  case tages     error  array     nome  issetPOST[nome]          trimPOST[nome]       if emptynome          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire un nome.          cognome  issetPOST[cognome]          trimPOST[cognome]       if emptycognome          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire un cognome.          indirizzo  issetPOST[indirizzo]          trimPOST[indirizzo]       if emptyindirizzo          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire un indirizzo.          civico  issetPOST[civico]          trimPOST[civico]       if emptycivico          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire un numero civico.      citta  issetPOST[citta]          trimPOST[citta]       if emptycitta          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire una citta valida.          prov  issetPOST[prov]          trimPOST[prov]       if emptyprov          error[]  urlencodeSi prega di inserire una provincia.          if emptyerror       SYNTAX ERROR CORRECTION        stmt  dbhgtprepareUPDATE tagesroma SET nome, cognome, indirizzo, civico, citta, prov   stmtgtexecutearraynome, cognome, indirizzo, civico, citta, prov      else        headerLocationtages.phpactioneditampid .

Negative 1759 pI am trying to find a simple solution to adding an outline to text, to make it stand out no matter what background sits behind it.p  pA google search of this issue revealed very little.  I was able to find one singular thread about this here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13220471blacklinearoundthetextblack line around the textap  pBut the accepted solution is only part complete.  I am not sure how to actually implement what Simon has suggested.  I created the Java class he describes, but I have no idea how to actually use it.p  pCan anyone make sense of this, or have another way of achieving thisp  pThis question has been marked as duplicate, but the answer linked does not work.

Negative 1759 pI have already read related materials about storm parallel but still keep something unclear. Suppose we take Tweets processing as an example. Generally what we are doing is retrieving tweets streaming, counting numbers of words of each tweets and write the numbers into a local file. p  pMy question is how to understand the value of the parallelism of spouts as well as bolts. Within the function of builder.setSpout and builder.setBolt we can assign the parallel value. But in the case of word counting of tweets is it correct that only one spout should be set More than one spouts are regarded as copies of the first same spout by which identical tweets flow into several spouts. If that is the case what is the value of setting more than one spoutsp  pAnother unclear point is how to assign works to bolts Is the parallel mechanism achieve in the way of Storm will find currently available bolts to process a next emitting spout I revise the basic tweets counting code so the final counting results will be written into a specific directory, however, all results are actually combined in one file on nimbus. Therefore after processing data on supervisors all results will be sent back to nimbus. If this is true what is the communication mechanism between nimbus and supervisorsp  pI really want to figure out those problems Do appreciate for the helpp

Negative 1759 pTo give an example scenario... Lets say we have a MongoDB collection of companies. Each company document can have multiple addresses stored in an array of Addresses. I want to search for companies that are near my location, but only show the address matched by the geoNear operator, not all the other Address array members. p  pIm trying something like  p  precodedb.Companies.aggregate                       geoNear                   near [ 77.3898602, 38.8735614],                  distanceField dist.Distance,                  maxDistance 0.02020712301086133,                 spherical true,                  distanceMultiplier 4948.75,                 includeLocs dist.location                            codepre  pThis gives me the coordinates of the array member that was used to calculate the distance, but I really just want only the parent document minus the address array members that werent matched. p  pAny ideas or tipsp  pThanks in advancep

This is because the item will get processed in the next loop cycle anyways.p  pFor the same reason, the codeStopFlagcode state doesnt matter. It just may process one or two extra cycles, which is acceptable. This class is part of a service which is rarely stopped, except for maintenance. So putting locks to catch onceinawhile event seems just like an overkill.p  pDo I still necessarily need to lock both these objects Will avoiding use of locks cause problems in this casep  pIn other words, can my codeStopFlagcode ever have anything other than True or False And can the codeMyQueue.Dequeuecode ever result into an object which is not a valid instance of codeSomethingcode classp

Negative 1759 pI ran into a surprise today, we are working on a application in C that connects to a mysql database. Everything worked fine until today when we migrated some stuff from one server to another. Now, some data are missing in the database and the Stored Procedures were expected to return null values because of it. Unfortunately instead of null values for integers we get integer values of 0.p  pFor simplicity lets say that I have the following stored procedure in our MySql Serverp  precodeCREATE DEFINERrootlocalhost PROCEDURE getconfigcode IN ordern BIGINT, IN orderpositionn INT, OUT outconfigcode BIGINT BEGIN     set outconfigcode  null END codepre  pthen I call the stored procedure through MySqlConnector .net by creating a MySqlCommand instance adding the parameters to it. Then the stored procedure is called in a very straightforward way as followsp  precodemReader  mCommand.ExecuteReader if mReader  null ampamp mReader .HasRows      mReader .Close  codepre  pthen I try to check if the parameter is Null like thisp  precodeif mCommand.Parameters[paramid].Value  System.DBNull.Value codepre  punfortunately despite the stored procedure explicitly setting the output parameter to null, the parameter is non null, and it is of type Int64 and has a value of 0 checked it through the debuggerp  pThe code works perfectly if data is actually there, and I get the correct integer value. My best guess is that it is not very easy to have a null integer value in c as it is a nonnullable type... but I expected the parameter to be of type System.DBNull anyway, even for nonnullable types it works perfectly for stringsp  pWhat am I missingp  pThanks in advance for any helpp
Negative 1759 pI am trying to make HTTP requests via the WebClient class and am having issues making actual connections.p  pUltimately I end up with this error messagep  blockquote   pError ConnectFailure A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.p blockquote  pI know for a fact that the issue is caused by the network setup, which has a proxy set up. I have tried using a variety of methods to retrieve the proxy settings  however proxy settings are retrieved via Windows strongAutomatically detect settingsstrong tickbox in Internet Options.p  pI know what the proxy address is, and I know it works because when I hardcode my WebClient to use a proxy, in this case, 192.168.1.108080, it works as intended. This software is intended to be used outside this location but also needs to work in this particular network environment, hence why Im looking for other ways to detect the proxy settings.p  pIve tried to answer my own question with various search queries, however Ive been unsuccessful with the various methodsp  ul liSetting the WebClients proxy directly with WebRequest.GetSystemWebProxyli liSetting WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy with the above which seems redundantli liUsing the deprecated WebProxy.GetDefaultProxy undesirableli liTrying to play around with a hrefhttpwpadwpad.dat relnofollowhttpwpadwpad.datali ul  pIve read the wpad.dat file simply in Notepad and found that it does contain the proxy address and it may very well be the solution. However I have not found a nonhacky way of implementing it correctly and would like some advice on this, or if this is not the way to go, the alternative.p  pSome additional information that may be useful Im developing using C Mono a .NET 3.5 equivalent version writing a standalone executable. App.configs are not applicable.p  pAny help is much appreciated, thanks.p
