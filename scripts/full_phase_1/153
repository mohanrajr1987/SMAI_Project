Negative 153 pIm building the worlds simplest library application. All I want to be able to do is scan in a books UPC barcode using a typical scanner which just types the numbers of the barcode into a field and then use it to look up data about the book... at a minimum, title, author, year published, and either the Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress catalog number.p  pThe goal is to print out a tiny sticker spine label with the card catalog number that I can stick on the spine of the book, and then I can sort the books by card catalog number on the shelves in our company library. That way books on similar subjects will tend to be near each other, for example, if you know youre looking for a book about accounting, all you have to do is find SOME book about accounting and youll see the other half dozen that we have right next to it which makes it convenient to browse the library.p  pThere seem to be lots of web APIs to do this, including Amazon and the Library of Congress. But those are all extremely confusing to me. What I really just want is a single higher level function that takes a UPC barcode number and returns some basic data about the book.p

I could resort to template specialization, however it would be nice not to have to specialize in the first place.p

Since the cookies originate from the ASP.NET server, the browser likely wont include them in the call to WCF.p  pSince this is an intranet application, I cannot necessarily rely on domain wildcarding .mydomain.com to make sure the cookies are shared across multiple machines  the client may well be accessing machines by their simple network name or even IP address directly.p  pstrongeditstrong accepting Julians answer, since using JS to manually grab a cookies payload and jam it onto the URL seems like the only way to workaround the restriction tho it feels somewhat inelegant p

That everything is a being handled as a method call more directly answers why code[]code is being slow, so that one gets it.p

Negative 153 pI recently needed to append some data to dynamically created codeLI elementscode. In my first instance, I used code.datacode in a way likep  precodevar newli  ltligtfoobarltligt newli.database, ball  append newli to an ul codepre  pthat.. was strongterriblystrong slow. This logic happens in a loop which can easily grow up to 500 items, it took ages Sometimes it even broke the javascript execution time frame.p  pSo I changed to code.datacode. Somehow, attaching data to an object with that is like strong8xstrong faster than doing it over the code.datacode method call. So now it looked likep  precodevar newli  ltligtfoobarltligt .datanewli[0], base, ball  append newli to an ul codepre  pThat wasis indeed faster, but still it took like 34 seconds to build up all my elements In my real code there are like 6 calls to .data per element.p  pSo I was really stuck with that, I asked myself why the heck to use code.datacode or code.datacode anyway I could just attach my data to the codeDOM objectcode. So I didp  precodevar newli  ltligtfoobarltligt newli[0].base  ball  append newli to an ul codepre  pVoila, strongwowstrong to my shock, that was incredibly fast I couldnt believe that this ran so good without any disadvantage. So that is what is my question all about actually. I didnt find any disadvantage for this technique so far on the net. There are reads about strongcircular referencesstrong you can create using this way, but AFAIK only on IEs and only if you refer to codeobjectscode.p  pAny thoughts experts p  pstrongupdatestrongp  pThanks for the good comments and postings guys. Short update patrick dwp  pYou are right, I was passing the underlaying codeDOM elementcode when using code.datacode. It does not even work with jQuery objects, at least not as expected. The idea about using one object and pass it through code.datecode I had myself, but then again I was so shocked about the performance difference I decided just to ignore the code.datacode method like forever.p

Negative 153 pFirst of all this is a homework assignment so Im looking for assistance, not solutions. Let me try to explain my schema. I have three tables well call users with columns id and name, parties with columns id, partydate, and userid and questions with columns id, createdate, and userid. My requirement is to show for every user the number of parties within the last year and questions created within the last year. At first I had something like thisp  precodeSELECT users.id, users.name,   COUNTparties.id AS numparties, COUNTqustions.id AS numquestions FROM users FULL JOIN parties ON users.idparties.userid FULL JOIN questions ON users.idquestions.userid WHERE parties.partydate gt NOW  interval 1 year OR parties.partydate IS NULL OR questions.createdate gt NOW  interval 1 year OR questions.createdate IS NULL GROUP BY users.id, users.name codepre  pNow this works, almost The problem is, if a user has no parties nor questions within the past year, they dont show up at all in the result. I want such a user to show up, I just want it to show them with 0 for each numparties and numquestions.p  pWhat I think I need here is some sort of conditional counting, where I only want to COUNTparties.id WHERE that partys partydate is within the past year, and the same for questions. Im just unsure how to do that. I have a hackyworkaround way to do what I want, where I basically UNION the above query with a near identical copy of itself, except I use SUM0 for numparties and numquestions and my WHERE statement is just where the date is lt instead of . I feel this is not the best way to go about it.p  pAny pointers in the right direction Thanks for the helpp

Negative 153 pI typically have not worried at all about piracy or copy protection with software however I currently find myself in a unique situation. I develop an application for repairing computers for a specific computer repair company. Recently an employee has decided to quit the company after only working there for one month, and took my toolset with her. She then started a computer repair company out of her home and is using my toolset to fix computers. I am not particularly concerned with this person as our lawyers are already in hot pursuit. My concern is with future instances of this where I may not find out about them.p  pWhat I would like are some ideas for ways to protect and or phone home without being too overbearing. I hate software that is too protected and becomes annoying or worse yet, worthless. This application is never to leave the walls of the computer repair company as they do not do onsite repair and I think I can use this to my advantage. p  pI do have a couple of ideas about how to go about restricting usage to within the company but I would like to hear how others have dealt with situations like this. Currently I keep going back to checking the network for specific servers or ip ranges but does anyone else have any other ideasp
Negative 153 pI have some experience with socket programming using the Berkeley socket API in C.  Generally, any socket programming requires a strategy that enables the receiving socket to know how much data it should receive.  This can be accomplished with either header length fields, or delimiter characters.  Generally, I prefer a header field which contains the length.p  pOf course, we emalsoem need to know the size of the length header field itself, which is simply a fixed size value that must be agreed upon by both sender and receiver.  In C, this is easy to implement because native integer types are fixed size and in binary format, so you can just say something likep  precodeuint16t bytestoreceive recvsock, ampbytestoreceive, sizeofbytestoreceive, 0 bytestoreceive  ntohsbytestoreceive  Now receive bytestoreceive bytes... codepre  pBut how is this sort of idiom accomplished using Python sockets  In Python, integers are objects and pickled integers are variable length byte arrays.  So we cant use a pickled integer as a length header field, because we cant be sure of its size in bytes.p  pOf course, I could always send a byte array of known size containing a binary integer, like codebx05x00code to create a 16bit binary integer with a value of 5 in little endian format, but this really doesnt seem like the right approach.p  pSo, how is this usually accomplished in Pythonp

Negative 153 pI want to show a button under a ListView. Problem is, if the ListView gets extended items added..., the button is pushed out of the screen. p  pI tried a LinearLayout with weights as suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4054567androidwhyistherenomaxheightforaviewAndroid why is there no maxHeight for a Viewa, but either I got the weights wrong or it simply didnt work. p  pAlso, I found somewhere the hint to use a RelativeLayout. The ListView would then be set above the button with the androidlayoutabove param. p  pProblem with this is that I dont know how to position the button afterwards. In the example I found, the View below the ListView was adjusted using androidlayoutalignParentBottom, but I dont want my button to cling to the bottom of the screen. p  pAny ideas apart from using setHeightmethod and some calculating of the required spacep  pThanks for your time, jellyfishp  hr  pEdit strongI got a lot of useful answers, thanks to all of youstrongp  ul lipbigstones amp user639183s solution emalmostem worked perfectly.

Its not what I intended but still might be useful for others.pli lipAngeloSs solution was the one I chose at the end as it just created the effects I wanted. However, I made two minor changes to the LinearLayout around the button p  ul lipFirst, as I didnt want to have any absolute values in my layout, I changed androidlayoutheight45px to wrapcontent, which works just fine as well. pli lipSecond, as I wanted the button to be centered horizontically, which is only supported by vertical LinearLayout, I changed androidorientationhorizontal to vertical. pli ul  pAngeloS also stated in his initial post that he was not sure if the androidlayoutweight0.1 param in the LinearLayout around the ListView had any effect I just tried and it actually does Without, the button gets pushed out of the screen again.pli ul

Ive read things, but it doesnt seem to be getting me closer as to what direction to take.  p  pIm looking for something easy and simple to implement.  Can someone suggest a technique, technology, tool, protocol, ... that might be good to use.  Im an expert C programmer and Ive been learning Java for Android, if those skills help in making a suggestion.  p  pFeel free to ask questions that may influence what choice would be best.  p  pThanks for being understanding about the generality of this question.  p  pPlease, no snark.  Thanks.p

Negative 153 pIve got a an audio processing app that takes an input audio file, processes it, and spits out a modified output audio file. This audio processing app has 1015 parameters that affect how it processes the audio, and thus affects the content of the output audio file it might have, say, a different frequency response, be louder, quieter, etc.. All these parameters have constrained ranges x0 must be lt 1 and  1 for example.p  pThe output audio file is evaluated by a tool that gives it a score. This tool knows what the ideal output should sound like, and scores the output file accordingly. A score of 1.0 means the output is ideal, i.e. the input file was processed with the best possible parameter set. A score of 0 means the output is completely wrong.p  pSo with 1015 parameters with their valid ranges, the combinations are endless Id be sitting here manually tweaking these parameters forever until I got the best solution. Ive checked out some LPMIP solvers CBC, MS Solver Foundation, GKLP but these use a mathematical equation as an objective function... you dont plug in an external evaluation function as far as I can see.p  pIs a LPMIP solver the right tool to aid in the parameter tuning Any ideasp  pThanks,p  pakevanp

Negative 153 pI have a performance problem with a hibernate implementation that is far to performance costly.

Lets say I have the following POJO classes the Entity classes are hibernate annotated copies.p  precodeCountry.java and CountryEntity.java  City.javaand CityEntity.java  Inhabitant.javaand InhabitantEntity.java  codepre  pAnd I want to add a city to a country and savepersist it in the database, the new city arrives fully populated as a POJO. Current codep  precodeCountryEntity countryEntity  CountryDao.fetchsomeId Country country  CountryConvertercountryEnity country.getCities.addnewCity countryEnity  CountryEntityConvertercountry CountryDao.savecountryEnity codepre  pThis results in a major performance problem. Lets say I have 200 cities with 10,000 inhabitants. For me to add a new city the converter will convert 200 x 10,000  2,000,000 inhabitantEntity  inhabitant  inhabitantEntity This puts a tremendous load on the server, as new cities are added often.  It also feels unnecessary to convert all cities in the country just to persist and connect another one.p  pI am thinking of creating a light converter which doesnt convert all the fields and only the ones I need for some business logic during the addition of the city, but those will be kept unchanged, I dont know if Hibernate is good enough to handle this scenario. For example if I save an entity with alot of null fields and the list cities with only one city, can I tell hibernate to merge this together with the db. Or is there a different approace I can take to solve the performance problem but keeping the POJO and Entitys separatep  pSome code below showing my current slow implementation code.p  precodeCountry.Java pseudo code  private fields  private ListltCitygt cities  City.Java pseudo code  private fields  private ListltInhabitantgt inhabitants  Inhabitant.Java pseudo code  private fields codepre  pCurrently I fetch a CountryEnity thru a Dao java class.

However, in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2487576trievssuffixtreevssuffixarray67233226723322this earlier question,a one of the top answers mentioned that suffix arrays are more widely used in practice.  I dont have any experience using either of these structures, but right now it seems like I would always prefer a suffix tree over a suffix array for problems that needed the functionality they provide fast substring checking, for example.p  pIn what circumstances would a suffix array be preferable to a suffix treep  pBy the way, while this question is related to the one Ive linked, I dont think its an exact duplicate as Im interested solely in a comparison of suffix arrays and suffix trees, leaving tries completely out of the picture.  If you disagree, though, I would understand if this question were to be closed.p

Negative 153 pI have been trying to figure this little section of my larger project out for a while now. It has stumped me pretty well too... I am trying to take information from an Excel CSV File See Example.CSV and have it input into the Cpp project.. Now before I get to the way I have been working on it, I thought I might first run some other ways by ya guys and see which you thought would be most efficient p  p1 Example1.csv Item Values still following the codesSwordName, lvlReq, minAtk, maxAtk, atkRate, sPrice, sValue, strReq, atkReq, intReqcode. Column Headers as shown in Example.csv.. Would it be ideal to make like a header that pulls Item Information from the CSV file when told to, For example If the player is at a shop, he wants to appraise his sword. When he clicks on the value button, it searches the Sword.csv file for the item IDMaybe and will return the 5th, given the value of the 5th column in that items row is the Value its worth.. And just create some kind of function that does that for everything If so, any ideas how to do that.p  p2 The main way I have been trying to get this to work in Example.csv I have all the items values I use in my program.. They are assigned to int and char variables, at least thats my goal.. Please direct to Example.cpp for my fail code and explanation..p  pExample.cppp  precode    include stdafx.h     include ltcstdlibgt     include ltfstreamgt     include ltiosgt     include ltiomanipgt     include ltiostreamgt     include ltsstreamgt     include ltstringgt     include ltsstreamgt      using namespace std       These are the Variables I use for a weapon, they corrospond according to number in list Wooden Shortsword is first in the       sSwordName Array, so its lvl requirment would be 1 since it is first.       Idealy this is the way I want things to work... Unless anyone has a better idea, I am open to hear them. I can always       learn more, especially from others.      char sSwordName[10][25]    Wooden Shortsword, Bronze Shortsword, Iron Shortsword, Steel Shortsword, Titanium Shortsword     int sSwordLvlR[10]     1, 3, 5, 6, 10     int sSwordV[10]        5, 10, 18, 25, 50     int sSwordP[10]        10, 20, 40, 60, 100     int sSwordMinAtk[10]   0, 0, 0, 0, 0     int sSwordMaxAtk[10]   4, 6, 10, 14, 20     int sSwordAtkRate[10]  0, 2, 3, 4, 6     int sSwordStrR[10]     1, 6, 11, 16, 22     int sSwordAtkR[10]     1, 6, 11, 16, 22     int sSwordIntR[10]     1, 3, 5, 8, 12       Now this is as close as I have been able to get to get this to work, sadly it is still off base...       I need it to take for example Row 1 gt Exclude Column 1 gt Input Data gt Assign to sSwordName[5][25] Array.       My issue is, finding a way to loop it where it takes all the cells in Row 1, ignores the first cell        I think making it do like n for it would work Not sure and then loop through the rest of the rows       repeating the same algorithm, Ignoring the first cell, inputting, assinging them to the variable arrays       It is much much easier to edit item stats and add new items in Excel, than having to do it via code as you       may imagine..       I am pretty sure my code is far from what would be best, I bet it needs to be rewritten a new way as well..       I would greatly appreciate Anyone who can help me accomplish this task.. It would really make my life       A lot easier, as well as make my project code considerbly shorter..       int main      int sSwordLvlR     double y     string data     string a      ifstream wInvExample.csv     while getlinewInv, data              if data.empty continue         istringstream ss data                        string inf             getline ss, inf              stringstream inf  gtgt sSwordLvlR             coutltlt ltltsSwordLvlR                     systemPause     return 0   I have not be able to figure out how to make it take the data for the Names yet either  codepre  pExample.csvp  precodesSwordName,Wooden Shortsword,Bronze Shortsword,Iron Shortsword,Steel Shortsword,Titanium Shortsword sSwordLvlR,1,3,5,6,10 sSwordMinAtk,0,0,0,0,0 sSwordMaxAtk,4,6,10,14,20 sSwordAtkRate,0,2,3,4,6 sSwordP,10,20,40,60,100 sSwordV,5,10,18,25,50 sSwordStrR,1,6,11,16,22 sSwordAtkR,1,6,11,16,22 sSwordIntR,1,3,5,8,12 codepre  pExample1.csvp  precodesSwordName,lvlReq,minAtk,maxAtk,atkRate,sPrice,sValue,strReq,atkReq,intReq Wooden Shortsword,1,0,4,0,10,5,1,1,1 Bronze Shortsword,3,0,6,2,20,10,6,6,3 Iron Shortsword,5,0,10,3,40,18,11,11,5 Steel Shortsword,6,0,14,4,60,25,16,16,8 Titanium Shortsword,10,0,20,6,100,50,22,22,12 codepre  pAs I said in the cpp, I would really really really appreciate anyone who can help me work out that code to its ideal working state...

Negative 153 pI am reading a hrefhttpwww.arcsynthesis.orggltutan awesome OpenGL tutoriala. Its really great, trust me. The topic I am currently at is Zbuffer. Aside from explaining whats it all about, the author mentions that we can perform custom depth tests, such as GLLESS, GLALWAYS, etc. He also explains that the actual meaning of depth values which is top and which isnt can also be customized. I understand so far. And a hrefhttpwww.arcsynthesis.orggltutPositioningTut0520Overlap20and20Depth20Buffering.htmlthena the author says something unbelievablep  blockquote   pThe range zNear can be greater than the range zFar if it is, then the   windowspace values will be reversed, in terms of what constitutes   closest or farthest from the viewer.p      pEarlier, it was said that the windowspace Z value of 0 is closest and   1 is farthest. However, if our clipspace Z values were negated, the   depth of 1 would be closest to the view and the depth of 0 would be   farthest. Yet, if we flip the direction of the depth test GLLESS to   GLGREATER, etc, we get the exact same result. So its really just a   convention. strongemIndeed, flipping the sign of Z and the depth test was once   a vital performance optimization for many games.emstrongp blockquote  pIf I understand correctly, performancewise, flipping the sign of Z and the depth test is nothing but changing a codeltcode comparison to a codegtcode comparison.

Negative 153 pI have a class, codePlottercode, which has a static event declared codepublic static event MouseEventHandler MultiCursorMouseMovecode for those wondering how I have a static event.  p  pIt emulates a graphical plot and our current application displays about 3040 of them. The purpose of the event is to draw a cursor across all displayed graphs to indicate the value for the graph at the time the mouse cursor is pointing at. p  pThe problem Im running into is that, because the codePlottercode instances have this static event, they refuse to die. As best I can tell looking at them in a memory profiler, every instance of a codePlottercode as well as the Form which contains them is being held in memory by an codeEventHandlercode tied to this codeMultiCursorMouseMovecode event. I have coded set up which runs the codeDisposecode method on each of the codePlottercode instances, which includes removing the delegate from codeMultiCursorMouseMovecode, but it doesnt seem to be doing any good. According to what I can see via the debugger, codePlotter.MultiCursorMouseMovecode registers as null, but these instances still arent getting collected and, best as I can tell via the profiler, all of the instances continue to exist due to codeMultiCursorMouseMovecode.p  pSo, the question I have is, is there any way to explicitly state remove all delegates associated with this eventbr I figure that way Ill be sure I got rid of all of them, not to mention it will simplify things compared to my current code which, during the codeDisposecode method, cycles through all of the controls on the tab and runs codeDisposecode on all of the codePlottercode objects it finds.p  pTo be perfectly open, I a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8070094csharptryingtofindremainingeventhandlerpreventingcontrolfromgoingousubmitted this question last weeka but after saying it was solved, I found another issue.

Negative 153 pHow do I find out what the mtime resolution of a system is from Node.jsp  h3Why Im askingh3  pIn Node.js, codefs.watchcode will sometimes emit duplicate codechangecode events. In order to avoid taking redundant actions, its common to use code like this from CoffeeScripts codecoffeecode utilityp  precode  if event is change     fs.stat source, err, stats gt       throw err if err       return if stats.size is prevStats.size and         stats.mtime.getTime is prevStats.mtime.getTime       prevStats  stats       ... codepre  pHeres the problem Under OS X, because of the underlying HFS filesystem, codemtimecode has a resolution of only 1 second. That is, codemtime.getTimecode values are of the formp  precode1322068921000 codepre  pSo whenever two changes occur within 1 second of each other, theres a chance that the second change will not affect the files codemtimecode. Thanks to the codestats.sizecode check, this is only a problem if the second change had no effect on the files size. Still, its a problem.p  pA reliable solution would be to debounce the codechangecode events by the mtime interval i.e. under OS X, when a codechangecode occurs, I would wait 1 second to act on it thereby grouping all change events that may have the same codemtimecode together. But Id like to delay the event by the minimum possible time under each file system, rather than adopting the greatest common denominator.p

So I am asking myself, are there different versions of testng Maybe one can handle it, the other notp  pEDIT This is the stacktrace. It is exactly the same in the eclipse plugin and in ANT.

Negative 153 pI have some objects which I want to connect with lines. The user should be able to do so with a simple linegesture. I use a GestureOverlayView and read that article a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcesarticlesgestures.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcesarticlesgestures.htmla, which says the followingp  blockquote   porientation indicates the scroll orientation of the views underneath. In this case the list scrolls vertically, which means that any horizontal gestures like actiondelete can immediately be recognized as a gesture. Gestures that start with a vertical stroke must contain at least one horizontal component to be recognized. In other words, a simple vertical line cannot be recognized as a gesture since it would conflict with the lists scrolling.p blockquote  pAnd that is my problem  I want to draw the lines horizontal and verticalp  pNow I have a OnGesturePerfomedListener, which does the normal gesture recognition and additionally a GestureOverlayView.OnGestureListener, in which I detect the lines. But now I want to draw a dashed line  also vertical and horizontal. It would be so much easier, if I could get the complete gesture as in the OnGesturePerformedListener, instead of every single stroke of the dashed line, as in the onGestureListener.p  pAny ideas how I can solve this easily  Is there a method, which is called when the gesturing is done, even if it is not recognised  I also tried to use the GestureDetector.OnGestureListener, which I now use to detect longPress, but it wont help with that problem.p

Negative 153 pIm using the YouTube API to get comments for a video with a parameterized query like the followingp  pcodehttpgdata.youtube.comfeedsapivideostheVideoIDcommentsv2ampaltjsoncodep  pThe problem with this is that the maximum number of results you can get per query is 50. I want to get every comment. Im currently using the codestartindexcode and codemaxresultscode parameters to solve this. I had a bit of trouble doing iterations of 50 at a time because sometimes the iteration would have a startindex above the number of comments and I couldnt figure that out, so I just tried to work out one at a time. It may be better to do 50 at a time, so let me know if that is the better solution. For nowp  pIm using PHP to get the amount of commentsp  precodeltphp     videoID  gT2HYxOdxUk     JSON  filegetcontentshttpsgdata.youtube.comfeedsapivideosvideoIDv2ampaltjson     JSONData  jsondecodeJSON     commentCount  JSONDatagtentrygtgdcommentsgtgdfeedLinkgtcountHint gt codepre  pAnd then Im calling a JavaScriptjQuery function to load all comments into an array.

For starters, heres how Im calling the functionp  precodeltbody onLoadloadCommentsltphp echo commentCount gt, ltphp echo videoID gtgt codepre  pNext, the actual functionp  precodefunction loadCommentscount, videoID           fori  1 i lt count i          .ajax             url httpgdata.youtube.comfeedsapivideos  videoID  commentsv2ampaltjsonampmaxresults1  ampstartindex  i,             dataType jsonp,             success functiondata                 .eachdata.feed.entry, functionkey, val                      comments.pushval.content.t                     commentOutput.appendval.content.t  ltbrgt Just for testing purposes.                                               codepre  pThe problem is that it is really iffy. When I use the codecountcode variable as the terminating part of the for loop like this, it always gets like, for example, 45 out of 211 comments. If I manually enter 211, it will go to around 195. If I put in a low number, like 115, it pretty much always gets them all. 20, its never right.p  pI need to figure out how to get this to consistently get all the comments of a given video by taking advantage of the codemaxresultscode and codestartindexcode parameters.

Negative 153 pSorry if this is a dupe. There are many similar questions but it seems that none really addresses this problem. They are all a bit different.p  pSo what I want to achieve Consider a template class codeXltTgtcode. Now, I want that an extra constructor extists for a specific instanciattion of that template, lets say for pointers codeXltTgtcode. I do not want to create a whole template specification for codeXltTgtcode, because codeXltTgtcode should be exactly as the usual template and that template is gigantic, so copy pasting would be quite a code duplication smell, only that it has an extra constructor. I also do not want to make codeXltTgtcode inherit from codeXltTgtcode because I do not want to establish a subtype relation between these two.

Negative 153 pI have an existing database that I cannot change, but want to access using EF. For 90 of the database, I have been able to get Code First EF to work, and I am very impressed.p  pIve run into a case that I am wondering how to model or access the data through a navigation property.p  pIn one case, the tables are like this this example is totally made up, but represents the problemp  precodeCREATE TABLE Dog      id            INTEGER      PRIMARY KEY,     name          VARCHAR50  NULL,     breedid      INTEGER      NOT NULL   CREATE TABLE Breed      id               INTEGER      NOT NULL,     organizationid  INTEGER      NOT NULL,     description      VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,      Primary key id, organization   CREATE TABLE Organization      id            INTEGER      PRIMARY KEY,     description   VARCHAR100 NOT NULL  codepre  pIn Table breed, the organization represents an organization that has defined a breed. A dog can have several breeds, but the program only displays one, the results being filtered by the organization id  which is a value that is configured when the program is set up.p  pAn example of the data that might be present is thisp  precodeid    organizationID    Description  1                 1    Basset Hound  2                 1    Great Dane  2                 2    Grande Dane codepre  pWhere organization 2 has chosen to call the breed something different than organization 1.  The unique primary key is a combination of id and organizationID.  A dog has a breed, but  does not have a property to define one or more associated organizations.  It takes additional information from another table, or a configured value perhaps an enumerated value to find the breed of a dog.    p  pIn my case, to find a particular dog breed, you have to have a dog id and another piece of information organizationid which is related to program configuration.p  pThe dog, breed and organization classes look like thisp  precodepublic class Dog    public int id   get set    public string name   get set    public int breedID   get set     public virtual Breed  get set               public class Breed    public int id   get set    public int organizationID   get set                public string description   get set     public virtual Organization  get set      public class Organization    public int id   get set    public string description   get set   codepre  pAs seen in the code, Id like to use a Navigation Property on Dog that returns a breed, but dont think I can configure this in code first. p  pIve tried a few different things in fluent API, and leaving organization out  since thats easy and will also document things I dont think workp  precode1     modelBuilder.EntityltDoggt.HasKeyt gt t.id    modelBuilder.EntityltBreedgt.HasKeyt gt t.id    modelBuilder.EntityltDoggt.HasRequiredd gt d.Breed.WithMany.HasForeignKeyd gt d.breedID codepre  pOf course, the problem with this is that more than one breed will be returned and entity framework will throw an exception because the breedID itself is insufficient to yield a single value  which the model is calling for.p  precode2     Change class dog       Remove           public virtual Breed  get set        Add           public virtual ICollectionltBreedgt Breeds  get set             public Breed Breed              get                 Assume 1 is configured organization value               return Breeds.Singlet gt t.OrganizationId  1                          set                Breeds.Addvalue                               Change model         I dont know how to do this for the given classes.  Since its a Collection, it must look something like          modelBuilder.EntityltDoggt.HasManyd gt d.Breeds...          but I dont see how to specify that breedID is a foriegn key into the breed table. codepre  pIf I could get the model to work, the rest will work, but it does seem wierd and inefficient.  p  precode 3     Change model to account for composite key using first set of classes        modelBuilder.EntityltBreedgt.HasKeyb gt new  b.id, b.organizationId          modelBuilder.EntityltDoggt.HasRequiredt gt t.Breed.WithMany.HasForeignKeyt gt new  t.breedID, configuredValue  codepre  pI dont know how to inject configuredValue as in the last line, so this doesnt work either.p  pIf none of the above methods work, or if I cant find another way to configure code first properly, then Id like to specify that when the Breed navigation property getter is called, it should use a query that can get the appropriate breed and return it appropriately.p  pHowever, I dont want to dirty my POCO with the Context calls to return the result of the query. In other words, Id like to have a property on Dog that does NOT look something like this p  precodepublic Breed Breed     get        return context.Breed.Whereb gt b.id  this.id ampamp b.organizationID  1.Single         codepre  pIdeally, it would work like the Navigation collections do, where EF does its magic and returns the appropriate results.p  pIntuitively, it seems like I should be able to either configure this using POCOlike code or useextend a proxy to extend the configuration to use the particular query I want when the accessor is called. Or  it seems like I ought to be able to populate the property on any read and dirty the POCO on write. Im just not familiar enough with EF to know how to do this.p  pIs this possiblep  pAs an addition to the first post, because I desire to keep my POCO classes clean, I think I will probably implement the Repository pattern to encapsulate the complex queries like the ones Ive described, as well as support other operations also.p  pLooking at the EDMX that Ive generated from my Code First model, its not apparent how to implement the model from a database first perspective, either.p  pAny thoughts are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 153 pI have two user controls .ascx in which I have an ASP.NET AJAX TabContainer control, each with two or three tabs TabPanels. I use these controls in around 10 websites. All have worked fine, except the latest three websites. In those three, the TabPanel controls are rendered with duplicate id attributes, so the tabs div on the browser looks similar to thisp  precodeltdiv idctl00ContentPlaceHolder1mycontrol1mycontrolTabsctl00    idctl00ContentPlaceHolder1mycontrol1mycontrolTabsctl00    classajaxtabpanelgt codepre  pNone of the other markup in the TabContainer has duplicate ids, only the TabPanels. The earlier websites render this exact same user control with a single id its exactly the same because the sites share the same folder with the controls via a virtual directory.

Negative 153 pIm sorry if this question has already been asked, but Ive been looking for hours now and I only find answers to similar but notquitethesame problems, and none of them work in my case. Im a novice programmer, so its likely that my code doesnt work either due to cringeworthy design or due to a very simple, stupid mistake. I have an alternative design in mind, but I would like to know whether the design is literally impossible or whether Im just implementing it incorrectly.p  pSo heres what Im trying to do Im writing 2D collision detection code, which needs to work for both polygons and circles. Polygons need to be able to detect collision on circles and on other polygons, and circles need to be able to detect collision on polygons and other circles. I thought it would be nice to be able to put all collidable objects polygons and circles into one stdvector called Collidables, rather than having a separate vector for each class. So I created the abstract Shape class, which would be the parent of both Circle and Polygon and which would hold virtual collision detection functions. The Collidables vector would then be a sequence of Shape pointers. Heres what these classes look likep  precodein shape.h ifndef SHAPEHINCLUDED define SHAPEHINCLUDED class Polygon class Circle  class Shape  number of functions and variables irrelevant to the issue relevant functions, note that Vector with capital V is not stdvector but a class I wrote myself     virtual Vector detectCollisionconst Shapeamp Collidable const  0     virtual Vector detectCollisionconst Polygonamp Collidable const  0     virtual Vector detectCollisionconst Circleamp Collidable const  0  endif   in polygon.h ifndef POLYGONHINCLUDED define POLYGONHINCLUDED include shape.h edit deleted include circle.h, this is now included in polygon.cpp edit deleted redundant Circle forward declaration  class Polygon public Shape      irrelevant stuff     Vector detectCollisionconst Shapeamp Collidable const return Collidable.detectCollisionthis     Vector detectCollisionconst Polygonamp Collidable const     Vector detectCollisionconst Circleamp Collidable const  endif   in circle.h ifndef CIRCLEHINCLUDED define CIRCLEHINCLUDED include shape.h edit deleted include polygon.h, this is now included in circle.cpp class Circle public Shape      irrelevant stuff     Vector detectCollision const Shapeamp Collidable const return Collidable.detectCollisionthis     Vector detectCollision const Polygonamp Collidable const     Vector detectCollision const Circleamp Collidable const  endif codepre  pThe idea here is that any Shape should be able to detect collision on any other Shape without even being aware whether its detecting collision on a polygon or on a circle at the time of calling the detectCollision function. Imagine youre a circle and youre iterating over the Collidables stdvector. The first element is a Polygon, but you dont know that, you only know that you are a circle and that the parameter your detectCollision function is getting is a reference to a Shape. So you tell that Shape Look, I dont know what you are, but Im a circle. Here, Ill pass myself as a parameter to your detectCollision function and so you can return the result to me. So the Shape gets its virtual detectCollisionconst ampCircle called, which is then passed on to the detectCollisionconst ampCircle of its child, Polygon, which has an actual working implementation and which should then return a pointer to a point of intersection or a null pointer if there is no intersection.p  pThis worked fine when only the Shape and Polygon classes were written, but once I added the Circle class, my code wouldnt compile anymore. The error Im getting isp  pIn file included from polygon.cpp10 polygon.h In member function virtual Vector PolygondetectCollisionconst Circleamp const polygon.h4578 error invalid use of incomplete type const struct Circle shape.h87 error forward declaration of const struct Circlep  pIm assuming this is a design issue because of the ridiculous amount of circular dependency going on here Shape depends on its children because some of its virtual functions accept children as parameter, Polygon depends on Shape because it inherits from it and Circle because it has a detectCollision function accepting a Circleamp parameter and Circle depends on Shape because it inherits from it and Polygon because it has a detectCollision function accepting a Polygonamp parameter. The easiest way out is probably just giving up the idea of putting Polygons and Circles into one sequence container and just putting them into two separate stdvectors. Still, I would like to know whether my first design is just inherently impossible, possible but ugly, or solid but incorrectly implemented. I usually prefer to find this kind of stuff out by myself, but after several hours of searching and trying different solutions, I have to admit that I simply do not understand this problem.p  pedit some code changes suggested by Davep  pEDIT, link to full source, if someone would want more information a hrefhttpsgithub.comKoenPmedievalmeleecombatcpp relnofollowhttpsgithub.comKoenPmedievalmeleecombatcppap  pI am only compiling the files polygon.cpp, circle.cpp, vector.cpp and line.cpp test.cpp is currently irrelevant. Not that vector and line matter all that much for this error, not compiling them only compiling polygon and circle gives exactly the same error. The exact command Im using is g o test circle.cpp polygon.cpp line.cpp vector.cpp.p

Negative 153 pI have created a game which works fine but I have a problem with the key commands part. When I click somewhere on the screen my KeyDown event does not work.

Negative 153 pIm developing a web interface involving a JavaScript scrollbar restyling solution that attempts to hide the browsers default scrollbar behind an HTMLCSS replacement, while preserving support for the browsers default scrolling behavior, a feature many popular JS scrollbar plugins lack. The only issue Ive encountered with this method is that some browsers insist on displaying the default scrollbar on top of the one created by the plugin, destroying the desired aesthetic altogether.p  pIn an attempt to solve this problem, I tried wrapping the element containing the scrollbar in a div with codeoverflow hiddencode and using JS to detect the width of the default scrollbar and position the element it controls so that it falls outside the clipping boundary of the parent div. However, as many of you probably know, Content that spans beyond the bottom or right boundary of an element with codeoverflow hiddencode can be accidentally scrolled into view during mouse dragging operations like text selection in which the course crosses the bottom or clipping boundary of the concealing parent element i.e dragging to the right would bring the default scrollbar back into view.p  pLuckily, though, this behavior does not occur when content extends beyond the top or left boundary in such a scenario. Knowing this, Im considering continuing with the approach outlined above, but styling the scrolling element with codedirection rtlcode to flip its scrollbar from right to left, and beyond the boundary of the concealing element, then applying codedirection ltrcode to the child element containing all of its contents to negate the direction change for all of the actual content.p  pThis technique produced the desired result in every test Ive conducted thus far. However, Im wondering if this solution is too good to be true, and Im overlooking a fatal accessibility andor compatibility issue with CSS direction for scrollbar placement that should prevent me from using this method. p  pTLDR strongIs using the CSS direction property to control the position of an elements scrollbar a bad ideastrongp

Negative 153 pProblem In the code presented I am trying to index 26000 geofences polygons. I have tried many combinations of 1inserting the data and 2indexing the data that some are not presented in the code for brevity. I have imported all the data with prebuilt index importing the data and then making the index and making the index and importing the data partially with waiting for nonstale index. In all cases it eats up all the memory and fails by fail I mean I wait for 30 minutes for completing the indexing process.

Negative 153 pI have a performance problem with cursor which I would like to avoid.  The problem I am trying to solve is To update a column VARCHAR  on each record about 6000000 by using one update statement in the Main table by using a result calculated by a UDF which itself should update a counter in another Counter table.br  The problem is that the UDF can not update Countertable because it is a side effect.   It also can not update a temp or variable table because of READONLY flag.  I used an update trigger on the main table, but the trigger fired once by a single update statement which stored in a table called inserted.p  pThe solution I have opted to is to use the Cursor as follows. p  ol liCreate a cursor from the Main table.li lifetch the first row li liget the counter from the Counter table li licounterli licall a PROC to calculate the result , counter, etcli liupdate the Main table with the result from the PROCli liupdate the Counter tableli lifetch another rowli ol  pBut believe me it is too slow about 125 hours no way.p  pCan any one out there help mep

If I do something like thisp  precodenode.nginxupstreams.merge service3 gt [service3.server.com] codepre  pThen, when I try to use the attribute in my template, I get a codeundefined method each for nilNilClasscode in my template when i try to dop  precodelt node.nginxupstreams.each do name, servers gt codepre  pPlus, I also get a codeWARN Setting attributes without specifying a precedence is deprecated and will be removed in Chef 11.0code. The helpful warning tells me how to set attributes at normal precedence apparently, using codenode.set[key]  valuecode, but doesnt tell me how to specify default or override attributes.p  pI can get around this problem by doing something like thisp  precodeupstreams  node.nginxupstreams.tohash upstreams.merge service3 gt [service3.server.com]  template nginxconfig do     variablesupstreamsgtupstreams end codepre  pbut that feels like a hack. I cannot find any documentation on codenode.setcode beyond a hrefhttpdocs.opscode.comchefessentialsnodeobject.html relnofollow titlethis pagethis pagea, which also indicates that you can set both normal and override attributes in the recipe but doesnt say how.p  pSo... how do you properly set attributes that get deepmerged along with everything else from inside the recipe What does the codenode.setcode call actually do, and can I tell it the precedence I want to merge atp

Negative 153 pI am looking for the correct term of a logical construct that I would call strongpassive state machinestrong.p  pImagine this embedded device Some lower program layer handles a chip card reader and reacts on the user input by determining three states Card in, Card out, Card error. Adequate lowlevel actions are performed here. Call this a state machine.p  pThe lower layer reports the state to some strongupper program layerstrong which reacts on strongchangesstrong and communicates with the rest of the system, i.e. sends messages, switches LEDs etc.p  pThe program logic in this emupper layerem can also be modelled UML 2 like a simplified state machine on its own it has transitions between the states and  most importantly  strongentry and exit actionsstrong. The states are basically the same as in the lower layer, but not necessary e.g. might be reduced to Card OK, Card not OK.p  pThe big difference is that this upper layer state machine doesnt do any strongdecisionstrong  it merely strongreactsstrong on the state it gets from the lower level and provides actions. The statetransitionaction model is just a nice way to visualise the logic to the reader and, of course, to tell the compiler what to do... in a wellarranged way.p  pOr, put it differently in a real state machine, as I understand it, the emstatesem logic decides the next state to transition to. In the passive variant, some emouterem entity does the decision and the states follow accordingly. Consequence emallem transistions between the states must be possible in the upper level.p  pBut is this actually a finite state emmachineem I imagine something active here Or is there a better term around that ephasises the passive character of this modelp  pEdit Thanks for the replies Two figures to clarify. Of course both are state machines. However I see some qualitative difference imagine the lower level SM has direct contact to the hardware valves, sensors and knows the system it reflects. For instance, only state normal can react to the test button, the others cant. Not all transitions are possible. The higher level is considered dumb and should only visualisereport the input it gets from lower level. So emallem transitions must be possible. The stateswitchlogic is the same for all states an would be implemented emoutsideem the states thinking as a programmer to avoid redundancy. It doesnt decide, it just does the entryexit actions.p  pLower level img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkOM05.png altenter image description herep  pHigher level img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comROyoP.png altenter image description herep

Negative 153 pSo I want to limit the users options for upload to a list of specific file extensions. This is purely to make it easier for the user, I am already limiting filetype upload on the server also.p  pI have a list of extensions but not a list of mime types. As the accepted extensions can potentially change, and I dont see any completely reliable way to dynamically calculate their mime typesand would rather avoid this I would like to instead just feed the extensions into the accept attribute of a codeltinput typefilegtcode element.p  pI have noticed this works exactly as intended on Chrome, but not in FF or IE10 in these browsers it seems to just fallback to all files. p  pI realise this isnt part of the standard but is there any way to accept extensions instead of mimetypes in the accept attribute that is modern browser crossbrowser friendly. My test case used codeltinput typefile accept.doc,.docx,.bad gtcodep  pIf this is not possible, what is the best approach note I have no garuntee my servers registry will contain all the mimetypes of the extensions I use, and because this list can be very long it is rather impractical and will be my last resort to manually keep a list up to date of mimetypes.p

Negative 153 pI am curious the method developers use to take items in a database which each have different properties, inserting them into HTML as a DOM element and then allow the user to select these items while still have that data binded so following queries to the database are relative to the users click.p  pFor example, say I have an eCommerce site that sells clothing and apparel. A database may hold productID, productName, productColors, ect.. Now I use this data to create some DOM elements to show all these items on a page.

Deleting it in the element tab however DOES fix the website until it is reloaded obviously, but obviously doesnt help me with my problem.p
Negative 153 pI want to create a few custom events, which will always call the registered event handlers in the reverse order of event registration i.e. most recently registered event handler is always called first. Is it possible These events will be raised by Business Layer classes on certain error conditions, where registered event handlers may be able to overcome the error condition.p  pIts a purely technical question, whether it is possible to do so or not Is it possible to override the event chain call order Does the language any version of C 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 support this feature or not p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe likely usage will be for error reporting and error recovery where possible. Example, Func A calls Func B which calls Func C. Func C may encounter an error condition and has an event for that. Func A and Func B would have registered for the event, if they are capable of providing an error recovery mechanism. Since Func B is more likely to have the context in which to solve the error, I want to call the most recent registered handler and check event args to see if error is resolved. If yes, I will not even call the other event handlers. If no, I will call the 2nd most recent registered handler, which will be the callers caller function i.e. Func A.p  pIn most cases, code is usually structured in a way that if Func A calls Func B, then Func B does not call Func A i.e. cyclic calls are usually not there, and order of event handlers will be identical to order of function calls. So if Func A calls Func B which calls Func C, and Func C raises an error event, the most suitable candidate to handle the error is Func Bs event handler, followed by Func As event handler and so on.p  pIts like an unwinding of the stack trace and give the most recent caller function the opportunity to consume the event. Any no. of caller functions might be there.p  pAfter the event has been consumed successfully by any handler, the Func C which raised the error event will proceed.

If I select that same mode of linear gradient and press the button control, it changes the colors as I desire maintaining the fill type of linear gradient. If I then switch the mode to single color fill and click the control button, that works too, changing the rect to a single color.  Here is what I have inside my class function to change the mode that makes that specifically workp  precodethis.background.setFillthis.color1 codepre  pInside that same function based on a conditional it should change the fill to linear gradient and does this as long as its not changed to single color fill as above firstp  precodethis.background.setAttrs     fillLinearGradientStartPoint [0, 0],     fillLinearGradientEndPoint [960, 600],     fillLinearGradientColorStops [0, this.color1, 1, this.color2]    codepre  pIve also tried within that same blockp  precodethis.background.setFillLinearGradientStartPoint0, 0 this.background.setFillLinearGradientEndPoint960, 600 this.background.setFillLinearGradientColorStops[0, this.color1, 1, this.color2] codepre  pI know that the proper variables and values are being passed to the function and that the conditionals are working because it will change the fill mode type from its as initially instantiated linear gradient fill to a single color fill which will continue working even as a different single color.p  pThe problem is when I try to switch BACK to linear gradient fill it will not do so, or repaintrefresh at least despite its calling this same function with the proper values. So, I suppose that my specific question is stronghow can I change the fill style of a KineticJS Rect multiple times, from a single color fill back to a linear gradient fill after it has been already been added to the layer and stage and has an animation loop implementedstrongp  pThis is my first question post so I hope that I am doing so properly please inform me if I should be doing anything differently.

Negative 153 pI was able to cabal install codetexticucode without errors.  I used codeextralibdirscode and codeextraincludedirscode to point to the codelibcode and codeincludecode directories in the binary distribution of icu4c.p  pI was also able to build the following simple program that uses codetexticucode, by doing codeghc make icu.hscodep  precode icu.hs import Data.Text.ICU main  print  Locale trTR codepre  pNo errors or warnings in either of these steps.  But when I try to run the compiled program, codeicu.execode, I get no output at all.  I expected to get a line with codeLocale trTRcode, but instead I get nothing  not even an error or warning.

Negative 153 pI think I do not quite understand how F infers types in sequence expressions and why types are not correctly recognized even if I specify the type of the elements directly from seq.p  pIn the following F code we have a base class A and two derived classes, B and Cp  precodetype Ax      member a.X  x  type Bx      inherit Ax  type Cx      inherit Ax codepre  pIf I try to yield their instances in a simple sequence expressions, I get two errorsp  precode Doesnt work, but it makes sense. let testSeq  seq      yield A0     yield B1  Error, expected type A     yield C2  Error, expected type A  codepre  pThat can make sense, since it may not be so trivial to infer common types interfaces, I think, can make that work far harder. However, those errors can be fixed with a safe castp  precode Works fine  let testSeqWithCast  seq      yield A0     yield B1 gt A     yield C2 gt A  codepre  pWhat if I do not want to use casts I tried to specify the sequence type directly from seq, but things do not seem to workp  precode Should work, I think... let testGenSeq  seqltAgt      yield A0     yield B1  Error, expected type A     yield C2  codepre  pSo, my question is is there a way to avoid casts If not, is there a reason why even specifying the type doesnt make the code workp  pI tried digging through following linksp  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd233209.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd233209.aspxa a hrefhttplorgonblog.wordpress.com20091025overviewoftypeinferenceinfhttplorgonblog.wordpress.com20091025overviewoftypeinferenceinfap  pBut I found nothing useful...p  pThank you in advance for any kind of answer you can give p

Negative 153 pI want to publish two .apks of my application on the android market so I can support a smaller apk for older devices.

Negative 153 pI found a wellwritten CSV parserreader from this a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles9258AFastCSVReader relnofollowlinka written by Sebastien Lorion. p  pWhat I like of this CSV parser is that I could easily bind it to a DataGrid likep  precodeusing CachedCsvReader csv  new    CachedCsvReadernew StreamReadertxtChosenFile.Text, true                      dataGridView1.DataSource  csv          codepre  pWhich is what I need in my project because I want my users to preview it before committing it to the Database.p  pHowever, since it takes a while to load a file I need to provide at least a feedback to my user using a Progress Bar. Unfortunately, it is only one liner to get the codeCachedCsvReadercode class which make it difficult for me to link or update a progress bar as the reading of the csv file progresses.p  pIf it is just a simple codeCsvReadercode class it would be easy to update my progress Bar likep  precodeusing StreamReader sr  new StreamReaderopenFileDialog1.FileName                      using CsvReader csv  new        CsvReadersr, true                              double progress  double sr.BaseStream.Position   double sr.BaseStream.Length                 progressBar1.Value  intprogress100                        codepre  pHowever, since I am using a codeCachedCsvReadercode and it is only one liner or two to get upload the csv reader without having an information on the stream position and length then I could not update my progress bar.p  pSo, what would be the base way to connect my progress bar to my CachedCsvReaderp  pAny suggestionsp  pThanks for your help and GOD bless.p

Negative 153 pI am having a tough time figuring out how to access a page loaded in an iframe from the outer page.  Both pages are local files, and Im using Chrome.p  pI have an outer page, and many inner pages.  The outer page should always display the page title for the inner page it makes sense in my application, perhaps less so in this strippeddown example.  This works without any problem in AppJS, but Ive been requested to make this app work directly in the browser.  Im getting the error emBlocked a frame with origin null from accessing a frame with origin null. Protocols, domains, and ports must match.em.p  pI think this is due to Chromes same origin policy regarding local files, but that hasnt helped me fix the problem directly.  I can work around the issue in this strippeddown example by using the window.postMessage method per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3076414waystocircumventthesameoriginpolicyWays to circumvent the sameorigin policya.

Negative 153 pI started implementing a few mfiles in C in order to reduce run times.  The mfiles produce ndimensional points and evaluate function values at these points. The functions are userdefined and they are passed to mfiles and mexfiles as function handles. The mexfiles use mexCallMATLAB with feval for finding function values.p  pI constructed the below example where a function handle fn constructed in the Matlab command line is passed to matlabcallingmatlab.m and mexcallingmatlab.cpp routines. With a freshly opened Matlab, mexcallingmatlab evaluates this function 200000 in 241.5 seconds while matlabcallingmatlab evaluates it in 0.81522 seconds therefore a 296 times slowdown with the mex implementation. These times are the results of the second runs as the first runs seem to be larger probably due to some overhead associated first time loading the program etc.p  pI have spent many days searching online on this problem and tried some suggestions on it. I tried different mex compiling flags to optimize the mex but there was almost no difference in performance. A previous post in Stackoverflow stated that upgrading Matlab was the solution but I am using probably the latest version MATLAB Version 8.1.0.604 R2013a on Mac OS X  Version 10.8.4. I did compile the mex file with and without largeArrayDims flag but this didnt make any difference either. Some suggested that the content of the function handle could be  directly coded in the cpp file but this is impossible as I would like to provide this code to any user with any type of function with a vector input and real number output.p  pAs far as I found out, mex files need to go through feval function for using a function handle whereas mfiles can directly call function handles provided that Matlab version is newer than some version.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongsimple function handle created in the Matlab command linestrongp  precodefn  x xx  codepre  pstrongmatlabcallingmatlab.mstrong p  precodefunction matlabcallingmatlab fn  x  zeros2,1  for i  0  199999     x2  i      f  fn x   end codepre  pstrongmexcallingmatlab.cppstrongp  precodeinclude mex.h include ltcstringgt  void mexFunction int nlhs, mxArray plhs[],                   int nrhs, const mxArray prhs[]       mxArray lhs[1], rhs[2] parameters to be passed to feval     double f, xptr, x[]  0.0, 0.0  x input to f and ffx     int n  2, nbytes  n  sizeofdouble   n dimension of input x to f       prhs[0] is the function handle as first argument to feval     rhs[0]  constcastltmxArray gt prhs[0]        rhs[1] contains input x to the function     rhs[1]  mxCreateDoubleMatrix n, 1, mxREAL     xptr  mxGetPr rhs[1]       for int i  0 i lt 200000 i              x[1]  doublei    change input          memcpy xptr, x, nbytes    now rhs[1] has new x         mexCallMATLAB1, lhs, 2, rhs, feval         f  mxGetPr lhs[0]        codepre  pstrongCompilation of mex filestrongp  precodegtgt mex v largeArrayDims mexcallingmatlab.cpp codepre

Negative 153 pIm fairly new to the android platform and I overrode a CustomViews onDraw method with codecanvas.drawPathpath, paintcode in order to produce drawings on the page.p  pHowever, I attempted to save this drawing to be used in another activity final page where multiple saved drawings can be displayed side by side, but I ran into frequent issues with no images appearing on my final page. p  pI was wondering how to handle this scenario.

In another file, somehow print all possible split locations where lineN and lineN1 have different first field. Then write program to select only those split points that are near 10k.

I need to be able to exit the program when the user enters the EOF key, but  getch does not actually catch the EOF keystroke. I know I can get it to work by using getchar instead of getch, but I would prefer not to have the user be forced to press enter after every function selection. p  pIs there a way to get getch to catch EOF This is for Windows if it is of any importance, any help is really appreciated, as I have been unable to find anything out there.p

However if I hardcode the line above with the iPhone resolution it will look great. So my question is how can this be done dynamically I have tried the resize event listener with no luck.

Negative 153 pGood Morning,p  pToday I have a question concerning openssl.

But I realized that when you sign a certificat by default the timezone of the certificate is GMT while my server are using CET. p  pSo I thought that I was going to use startdate when I generate the certificate and the problme will be solwed. But even when I use start date like 20140404000000Z , the time zone is still GMT while my server is in CET.p  pIs it possible to tell him to use the timezone of my server and not GMT. My server is a centos.p  pAny help would be appricated.p  pThanksp

Negative 153 pWhat are the advantages of using a 1.3 version of AngularJS framework in contrast to the 1.2.x branchp  pIve read that in the 1.3.x releases the support for Internet Explorer 8 will be dropped. So Id like to know whether the featurescapabilities of 1.3 version are so tempting that one might accept the lack of support to IE 8. Are only the new features going not to work in IE 8, or the existing in 1.2.x releases ones too Are there any patches that enable the use of AngularJS 1.3 in IE 8p  pstrongEDITstrong IE 8 is not my only concern. I would like to know what 1.3 version has that 1.2 hasnt any why is it more powerful.p

Negative 153 pI am working on generating a graph with Java using jgraph and jgrapht libraries. The problem is that my graph has a very big number of vertices varying from 300 to 1000 in some cases and no matter what I try, vertices and edges keep on overlapping each other creating a mess and, of course, a nonreadable graph. The method I used until now for placing the vertices on the JFrame is using random numbers as coordinates. Is there some other way to make this work Maybe a better working algorithm or another Java library for better results Thank you in advancep

Negative 153 pI am working on my current game app and I am not using any of the game engine platform. I code the game in Java and think to publish for Android devicesbecause the registration fee is very low as you all know. But in the part of the game I have a logic error. I have been researching it, unfortunately I havent found any solid answer about it. p  pI saw a game in Google play and some of the game features are very similar the thing that I try to implement to my codes. Is there any chance to see the codes of that gameI am sure that is sort of impossible because of the copyrights. Or does Google allow the developer to see the codes like an opensourcep  pMy other question is if those game engine platforms are worthy to pay over 1500 or note.g UNITY. The reason I am asking this if I can not solve this logic error, It seems like it is going to be easier for me to pay and get one of those game engines. Thanks for your time and attention.p

Negative 153 pC is the first language Ive used at all extensively that uses objectorientation, so Im still a bit new to the idea. Im trying to port a game library I was working on from Go which uses interfaces instead of a true OOP system to C.p  pI have a collision system that uses four types A point, a bounding, a line, and a polygon.

It would look something like thisp  precodebool CollidesCollider obj1, Collider obj2 codepre  pOriginally I was thinking I could have methods for each collision type that would test for a collision given another type i.e. methods OnPoint, OnBounding, OnLine, and OnPolygon and then have Collider be a virtual class that requires all these methods, but then I realized that would be impossible in C because it would make classes depend on each other for compilation right.p  pIm a little bit at a loss about what else I can do.

Negative 153 pI have a puzzling problem.p  pContext is dataset of unknown size which gets iterated over constantly but has minimal insertions after initialisation speed at initialisation not a concern. The data is sorted into ordered indexes of unknown numbers.p  pSo I am using vectors but positioning the insertion of elements according to the index numbers. The strange thing Ive found is that the order of insertion emtypeem affects iteration performance.p  pSpecifically I was dealing with a test scenario where I was adding three identical elements, with indexes 0, 1 and 2.p  pNow, depending on the order they are added to the vector, they will either be pushbackd or .insertd, in order to create the correct linear order of numbers.p  pAnd I created a loop iterating over these and seeing how many loops I could accomplish in a given timeframe 10 seconds.p  pWhat I found was that if I added them in this order 1, 2, 0p  pI got onaverage 60 more loops than if I added them in this orderp  p2, 0, 1p  pand 30 more loops than this orderp  p0, 1, 2.p  pIn each case the insertions are correctly sorted so that the order within the vector is 0, 1, 2. The only difference between them is the type of insertion required.p  pFor 012, each insertion is a pushback. For 201, the first is a pushback, second is an insertion at .begin and third is an insertion before the iterator corresponding to 2. For 120, the first is a pushback, second is a pushback and the third is an insertion at .begin.p  pWhy should the third case scenario be any more performant To reiterate, there Is emNoem Difference between the methods in terms of the order or type or quantity of data stored  in each case the resultant order of the vector is 0, 1, 2. p  pI tested this with GCC 4.8.1 both with and without O2. The results were repeatable with minor fluctuations of 14 loops. To be fair, the differences are still minor  we are talking 60 loops out of around 15000.p  pThe only explanation I can think of is that the insertion type changes the allocation of the vector, possibly resulting in better, or worse, performance.p

Basically it consists of permissions for each different view on the web page.p  pFor example, permissions for the Service part of the website would look like the followingp  precodepublic bool ServiceView  get set  public bool ServiceEdit  get set  public bool ServiceCreate  get set  public bool ServiceDelete  get set  codepre  pWhere ServiceView lets you view services, ServiceEdit lets you edit them, and so on.p  pTo check if a user has permission my first thought was to build a nested switchcase, like sop  precodepublic bool IsAuthorizedstring controller, string action      switch controller              case Customer             switch action                              case Index                 case Details return CustomerView                 case Edit return CustomerEdit                 case Create return CustomerCreate                 case Delete return CustomerDelete                      case Service             switch action                              case Index                 case Details return ServiceView                 case Edit return ServiceEdit                 case Create return ServiceCreate                 case Delete return ServiceDelete                      default return false       codepre  pThis however seems really ugly to me, so Im wondering if anyone has any tips for a simpler and probably more beautiful way of doing thisp  pI have been googling around a bit to get inspiration, and came across a reflectionbased way where you try to match the string to the property.

Negative 153 pI am using Androids internal storage to hold data for my application and I am trying to find a good way to handle reading data of an older schema.

Negative 153 pThis is more of an app design question so forgive me if its not relevant.p  pThe app I am working on is designed to show what shops are open in the area and I am not sure what is the best way to store this information. I get the information from a database I didnt design that supplies an array of boolean values that determine if the shop is open during that time or not. Each boolean value represents a 15 minute slot e.g. 07000715.p  pThis is split down into days but not specific dates, for instance the shop could be open MonFri 09001700 but Sat 09002000 so the model I keep will have to know what the day is but not necessarily the date.p  pWhat Im not sure about is how to store all of this for easespeed of lookup because I want the view to be able to update in real time shops change from open to closed without refresh. I have considered adding a table to the DB that contains opening times for any shop using proper times and days and then let SQLite do all the hard work allowing the Java to assume the shop is closed unless it gets a record back but that feels a little clunky because it might be better to hold the opening times in memory somehow.p  pAny help you can give would be awesome.p

Negative 153 pHi I am trying to implement a pause feature in my libgdx game but am having trouble pausing the animations that happen every 5 seconds.  In my render method I restart the animations every 5 seconds.  Once the animation is finished I stop drawing it and they work as expected restarting and drawing every 5 seconds.  However when I hit the pause button the current animation finishes off which is ok but as soon as I unpause the game it would immediately redraw another animation rather than waiting until the next 5 second time slot.

Forget everything above. whenever I change a property on the main form in the designer, the images that I added to the forms .resx file are getting removed. Hence why the images are getting set to nothing. Since this appears to be related to changes made in the designer, Im using Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate.

Can anybody tell me why this figure is created and how can I avoid itp  p2 Once I press the slider button and thus use the listener, all handles inside the GUI are not functionnal as Matlab does not recognize them and Im stuck with a functionnal sliderdisplay but I cant use the pushbuttons.p  pAny ideas on why this happens Here is the code I use in the Create Function of the sliderp  precodefunction slider2FrameVideoCallbackhObject, eventdata, handles  hListener  addlistenerhObject,ContinuousValueChange,a,b slider2FrameVideoCallbackhObject, eventdata, handles  a and b are dummy arguments  guidatahObject,handles codepre  pIn the slider callback, the code looks like this basically imshow in the current axisp  precodeaxeshAxis imshowMovieframe,parent,hAxis codepre  pcodedrawnowcodep  p This does not work either as handles.editFrameNumber is not recognized by Matlabp  precodesethandles.editFrameNumber, String, frame  guidatahObject,handles codepre  pAny hints are welcome thanksp

Negative 153 pThanks for the project  Really nice p  pI am currently trying to upgrade fullcalendar from v1 to v2. I fixed all the majors issues thanks to the Upgrading to v2 page documentation.p  pI am now stuck on a conceptual problem...p  pMy calendar displays events by users.  Each user is represented by a source of events.  Source of events are basically an array of events. When I add an event for a user, I want it to be added to the users source of events in a dynamic way. This way I always have a complete matching between sources and displayed events on calendar.p  pI succeeded to implement this use case in v1 as follows p  precodeprivate void addEventToSourceEvent event     get user    String userId  event.getUserId    get source for user sources is a map user gt JsonObject   JSONObject source  sources.getuserId    get the list of events   JSONArray array  JSONArraysource.getevents    add event at the end of the list   array.setarray.size, createJsonEventevent    refetch events from all sources   refetchEvents codepre  pp  pThis code works well thanks to the fact that the users source is previously known by fullcalendar js p  precodeprivate static native void addSourceString calendarId, JavaScriptObject source    wnd.jQuerycalendarId.fullCalendaraddEventSource, source codepre  pp  pInternally, all my updates are done on the source object through JSON manipulations. When I refetch the events, all my users sources are up to date and well displayed on the calendar.p  pHowever, this code does not work on v2. It seems that the source I send to full calendar is different than the one internally used to display events. All my updates on the source are not applied to the internal data, and so not visible on the calendar.p  pIs there a way to get the inner sources of events used  Any idea to implement such a use case  Maybe I missed something... Thanks in advance p  pJulien p

Negative 153 pSo this is a bit of a head scratcher and Ive resorted to asking for help with it. I have created a series of functions with jQuery. Each function contains an animate queue and ends with a call back that loads the next function, again with its own animate queue. Once it reaches the end it calls the first function again and around we go. I have separated the queues into independent functions, because I want to be able to jump to specific points in the loop based on user clicks. So in the code below the loop runs through once, but when it goes back to the beginning the show and hide bits dont appear to be doing anything.

Negative 153 pCan we find if our software has been copied in an OS image windows and then deployed in another machine. The hardware details do change but it may be due to hardware upgrade or change.p  pIs there anything at software level which indicates that the OS image has been installed.p  pP.S the OS install date doesnt change after image deployment.It shows the date of original OS installation date and time and not that of the imaged one.p  pFor example i tried to detect this using service tag,uuid and os install date changes .

Negative 153 pThere was a phenomenal answer posted by alko for computing a partial derivative of a multivariate function numerically in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20708038scipymiscderivativeformutipleargumentfunctionthis threada.p  pI have a followup question now about enhancing this function to accept an array of input values. I have some code where Im looping through a big long list of ndimensional points, calculating the partial derivatives with respect to each variable, and this becomes quite computationally expensive.p  pIts easy enough to vectorize the function in question with codenp.vectorizecode, but it causes issues with the codepartialderivativecode wrapperp  precodefrom scipy.misc import derivative import numpy as np  def foox, y     returnx2  y3  def partialderivativefunc, var0, point[]     args  point[]     def wrapsx         args[var]  x         return funcargs     return derivativewraps, point[var], dx1e6  vfoo  np.vectorizefoo  gtgtgtfoo3,1 gtgtgt10 gtgtgtvfoo[3,3], [1,1] gtgtgtarray[10,10]  gtgtgtpartialderivativefoo,0,[3,1] gtgtgt6.0 gtgtgtpartialderivativevfoo,0,[[3,3], [1,1]] gtgtgtTypeError can only concatenate list not float to list codepre  pThe last line should ideally return code[6.0, 6.0]code. In this case the two arrays supplied to the vectorized function codevfoocode are essentially zipped up pairwise, so code[3,3], [1,1]code gets transformed into two points, code[3,1]code and code[3,1]code. This seems to get mangled when it gets passed to the function codewrapscode. The point that it ends up passing to the function codederivativecode is code[3,3]code. In addition, theres obviously the codeTypeErrorcode thrown up. p  pDoes anyone have any recommendations or suggestions Has anyone ever had a need to do something similarp  h2Edith2  pSometimes I think posting on SO is just what it takes to break a mental block.

Negative 153 pI recently discovered an extension for visual studio that allows you to specify a watermark for the code window.  This extension can be found on github here.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comnategreenwoodVSEditorBackgroundChangerExtension relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnategreenwoodVSEditorBackgroundChangerExtensionap  pAs part of a small project I am attempting to get it to work on SQL Server Management Studio.  While Microsoft doesnt officially support extending SSMS  they also do not discourage it.  Those are their words, not mine.p  pLooking into the extensionapplication sub folder under SSMS for SQL Server 2014 it is obvious that Microsoft uses VSPackage to include their own extensions to the Isolated Shell version of Visual Studio that SSMS is built on top of.  The manifests appear to be version 1 manifests however.p  pThese show up in the following location on my own box CProgram Files x86Microsoft SQL Server120ToolsBinnManagementStudioExtensionsApplicationp  pLooking for assistance in verifying if this extension can be modified to work with SSMS.  I have modified the package manifest in a variety of ways  including rewriting the package as a version one style package and manifest.  I can see the package registered under the pkgdef guid that VSIX generates.  It says it has been installed.  No error messages are thrown, but no image appears either.p  pDoes the Isolated Shell and more specifically, the code window utilized by SSMS to develop and execute TSQL support adornments such as the ones used by this package  Does SSMS support version 2 manifests and VSPackages  p  pAny advice on how to modify this package to get it to work is appreciated.p  pMy own attempts are further documented here  a hrefhttpsqljudo.wordpress.com31daysofssmsssmsday30vspackageandssms relnofollowhttpsqljudo.wordpress.com31daysofssmsssmsday30vspackageandssmsap

E.g. this is what Ive been tryingp  blockquote   pdf1  DataFramegpsdata,indexgpstime,columns[GPS]p blockquote  pAnd it gives this errorp  blockquote   pValueError Shape of passed values is 4, 35047, indices imply 1,   35047p blockquote  pWhich I dont know how to handle, if I can find a way around that then I assume the next step df2 but for accdata will work fine, and then I can do p  blockquote   pp  PanelACC df1, GPS df2p blockquote  pAny help would be greatly appreciated been stumped on this for last few hours.p
Negative 153 pIs there an equivalent of windows coderandscode function on linux  Indeed, a coderandcode function but generating random number between 0 and UINTMAX 4294967295p  pI have the solution of combine some digit coderandcode to create a big rand but Im pretty sure the probabilities will no more be 1UINTMAX because coderandcode is a pseudorandom function and here I calculate with a sequence of coderandcode call.

Negative 153 pInside a shell script amidst error checking loops, I have a command that contains a variable that must be updated once an hour.  The command as it exists currently is the line begins with a tp  precode        homeuserthermtherm d devttyUSB0 t host O 44.0 codepre  pIn this case, Im trying to replace the number thats after O.  This is a temperature in Fahrenheit, so it has the possibility of being a negative number or a positive number, and one, two, or three digits followed by a single decimal place.  So I have to be able to replace a variable that could be 15.0, 7.2, 104.5, or any other combination  with a new variable that could also be any of the above.p  pI can force the O setting to be the last thing on the line, which helps some.  But I cant count on anything else on that line except the file name, the d devttyUSB0 and the O always being there.  In this particular shell script there are no other instances of O, but I might want to verify that the line has either the file name or the d devttyUSB0 on it to avoid replacing a flag on some other line in the script.p  pThe new variable is parsed via xmllint and sed from an XML file grabbed via wget once an hour.  This shell script I need to edit is ran by cron every 5 minutes, only receiving the new string once an hour.  The new string can be passed to sed via a variable, or as a file with only the number and a n in it.p  pAny thoughts or brilliant ideas would be appreciated.  Thanks.p
Negative 153 pI use Amazon S3 as a part of my webservice. The workflow is the followingp  ul liUser uploads lots of files to web server. Web server first stores them locally and then uploads to S3 asynchronouslyli liUser sends httprequest to initiate job which is some processing of these uploaded filesli liWeb service asks worker to do the jobli liWorker does the job and uploads result to S3li liUser requests the download link from webserver, codesomedbrecord.resultfile.urlcode is returnedli liUser downloads result using this linkli ul  pTo work with files I use codeQueuedStoragecode backend. I initiate my codeFileFieldscode like thisp  precode    useruploadedfile  models.FileField..., storagequeueds3storage, ...     resultfile  models.FileField..., storagequeueds3storage, ... codepre  pWhere codequeueds3storagecode is an object of class derived from code...backends.QueuedStoragecode and coderemotecode field is set to code...backends.s3boto.S3BotoStoragecode.p  pNow Im planning to deploy the whole system on one machine to run everything locally, I want to replace this code...backends.s3boto.S3BotoStoragecode with something based on my local filesystem.p  pThe first workaround was to use FakeS3 which can emulate S3 locally. Works, but this is not ideal, just extra unnecessary overhead.p  pI have Nginx server running and serving static files from particular directories. How do I create my remote storage class that actually stores files locally, but provides download links which lead to files served by Nginx something like codehttpmyip80filedirfile1code. Is there a standard library class for that in djangop

Negative 153 pIs there any way to catch the codeKeyNotFoundExceptioncode in Java codeHashMapcode and add the key to the map in catch block p  pFor example, I want to add a value to the key in codeHashMapcode. If that key is not present, then codeKeyNotFoundExceptioncode will be thrown. p  pOne alternative is to each time check if the key exists. If it doesnt, add the key and then add the value. If it exists, directly add the value to the key. However, there will be lots of overhead with the if conditions. So, when this exception is thrown, can I add the key and value in the catch clause and then proceed properlyp

Negative 153 pHey guys so I have been working a lot on my Android App lately being able to solve most problems on my own, but this one stays a mystery to me. I have 3 Activities that connect to my MySQL DB through a php POST Script. Now the strange part about it all, my login and register script work like a charm but my 3rd Script which looks exactly the same as the other two throws me a NullPointerException saying my Response String is null. Using the php script through the web browser i get the echo that I want so my question is why is my code giving me this exception Like I said before the codes are nearly identical but only the 3rd

Negative 153 pI need to pass data from one deferred .NET custom action to another, but I cant figure out how to do this.p  pDeferred custom actions cant access the Windows Installer session, so session properties are not an option.

Why does this occur, if codeRandom.nextIntcode generates random integers that are uniformly distributed He provides a code snippet which clearly demonstrates this but I dont understand why this is the case, and how this is related to n being a power of 2.li ul

HeShe is able to view the hits from the search. But what if he want to search a specific category.

Negative 153 pI am working on an Android app that streams audio. I am currently using Android MediaPlayer. If I seek to a certain position in the audio file while streaming and at the same time seek to the same position in the same audio file that has been downloaded to my mac using QuickTime Player, I dont come to the same audio position. The display says that I am at the same position 024954 but the audio is not playing the same sound the streaming server is 2040 seconds behind the correct position. I tried the Exoplayer Demo app and replaced one of the static urls with my own streaming url. The same thing happens with Exoplayer. My friend that works as an iOS developer has no problem seeking to the right position while streaming using the same streaming server. I also have the issue that sometimes the streaming stops seconds before the actual audio streaming is done. I hoped that Exoplayer would solve my issues, since the old MediaPlayer seems to be a bit buggy. Does anyone have any idea on why I am having these issuesp

Negative 153 pIm writing a simple language that compiles to C, and I want to implement smart pointers. I need a bit of help with that though, as I cant seem to think of how I would go around it, or if its even possible. My current idea is to free the pointer when it goes out of scope, the compiler would handle inserting the frees. This leads to my questionsp  ul liHow would I tell when a pointer has gone out of scopeli liIs this even possibleli ul  pThe compiler is written in C, and compiles to C. I thought that I could check when the pointer goes out of scope at compiletime, and insert a free into the generated code for the pointer, i.ep  precode generated C code. int main      int x  mallocsizeofx     x  5     freex  inserted by the compiler  codepre  pThe scoping rules in my language are exactly the same as C.p  pMy current setup is your standard compiler, first it lexes the file contents, then it parses the token stream, semantically analyzes it, and then generates code to C. The parser is a recursive descent parser. I would like to avoid something that happens on execution, i.e. I want it to be a compiletime check that has little to no overhead, and isnt full blown garbage collection.p

Negative 153 pSome people are not aware that its a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions9653072returnastructfromafunctionincpossible to pass and return structs by value in Ca. My question is about the compiler making unnecessary copies when returning structs in C.  Do C compilers such as GCC use a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiReturnvalueoptimizationReturn value optimizationRVOa optimization or is this a C only concept Everything I have read about RVO and copy elision is in regards to C.p  pLets consider an example. Im currently implementing a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiQuadrupleprecisionfloatingpointformatDoubledoublearithmeticdoubledouble data typea in C or rather floatfloat to start with because I find it easy to unit test.  Consider the following code.p  precodetypedef struct      float hi     float lo  doublefloat  doublefloat quicktwosumfloat a, float b      float s  a  b     float e  b  s  a     return doublefloats, e  codepre  pWill the compiler make a temporary copy of the codedoublefloatcode value I return or can the temporary copy be elidedp  pWhat about named return value optimization NRVO in C  I have another function p  precodedoublefloat df64adddoublefloat a, doublefloat b      doublefloat s, t     s  twosuma.hi, b.hi     t  twosuma.lo, b.lo     s.lo  t.hi     s  quicktwosums.hi, s.lo     s.lo  t.lo     s  quicktwosums.hi, s.lo     return s  codepre  pIn this case im returning a named struct. Can the temporary copy in this case be elidedp  pIt should be stated that this is a general question for C and that the code examples I have used here are only examples when I optimize this I will be using SIMD with intrinsics anyway. Im aware that I could look at the assembly output to see what the compiler does but I think this is an interesting question nevertheless.p
Negative 153 pI have a custom view which can zoom and pan. All it does is display a codepathcode the coordinates of which are acquired from an API. Since codePathcodes are uploaded as texture into the GPU and then drawn, there is a maximum limit on the dimension of the codepathcode that can be drawn which varies from device to device. My custom view can grow pretty large  30000 pixels in area and in order to get around the limitation, I have been using codesetLayerTypeLAYERTYPESOFTWAREcode on my custom view. Its been working well but it doesnt help me in delivering 60FPS. p  pIn order to bring the frame rate to 60FPS, I have decided to switch back to codeLAYERTYPENONEcode. Now, instead of letting the path scale unchecked, I have decided to stop it at some particular zoom level and for further zooming, scale the codecanvascode at the loss of crispness. In order to find the zoom level at which I should stop scaling codepathcode and start scaling the codecanvascode, I have been doing some trails I am using nexus 7 2012 and nexus 9 as test devicesp  pI expected to see the message codepath too large to be rendered into a texturecode only after hitting the texture size limit which I find out using codecanvas.isHardwareAcceleratedcode. p  ol liFor nexus 7, the texture size limit is 2048, but the path disappears when its width or height hits a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8873242androidandroidgraphicspathwidthlimitedto20362036a amp I see codepath too large to be rendered into a texturecode in the log. I expected this to happen at 2048li liFor nexus 9, the texture size limit is 16384, but sometimes the app crashes with the log codeAlibc Fatal signal 11 SIGSEGV, code 1, fault addr 0x78 in tid 7252 RenderThreadcode before even the texture limit is hit. For eg., these are some of the dimensions of the custom view when the app crashes 7199, 5049, 13814, 2500, 8040, 4200. The only commonality I could find among those is that the total area of the custom view and also the codepathcode grows beyond 32,000,000 pixels. li ol  pTherefore, I couldnt decide when exactly I should switch from scaling codepathcode to scaling codecanvascode. Any ideas as to when to do thatp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI observed that for nexus 9, the app crashes whenever the total area of the codepathcode reaches 33,000,000. What does this limit signifyp

Negative 153 pYesterday I was in class, and at some point the instructor was talking about C code. He said p  blockquote   pWhat is the purpose of making a pointer cast in C The only purpose   is to make the compiler interpret correctly the pointer operations   for example, adding an int pointer will result in a different offset   than adding a char pointer. Apart from that, there is no difference all pointers are represented the same way in memory, regardless if the pointer is pointing to an int value, a char value, a short value, or whatever. So, casting a pointer will not modify anything in the memory, it will just help the programmer with operations more related with the pointertype he is dealing with.p blockquote  pHowever, I have read, specially here in Stack Overflow, that this is not 100 true. I have read that in some weird machines, pointers for different types can be stored in different ways in memory. In this case, not changing the pointer to the correct type could cause problems if the code is compiled to this kind of machine.p  pBasically, this is the kind of code Im talking about. Consider the code belowp  precodeint intpointer char charpointer intpointer  mallocsizeofint intpointer  4 codepre  pAnd now two optionsp  p1.p  precodecharpointer  char intpointer codepre  p2.p  precodecharpointer  intpointer codepre  pThe code on case 2 could became a problem Making the cast case 1 would eventually change the pointer format in memory if yes, could you give an example of machinep  pThanksp

Negative 153 pI am rotating a circle with a mouse but I want there to be a limit on how far the circle can be rotated. Lets say 3 full times. When it reaches its limit it can no longer be turned in that same direction, but the opposite direction it can be. I got it stopping after the max turns but now Im trying to find the direction and every time my mouse passes the xaxis of the circle the direction changes because atan2 gives me the angle relative to the xaxis. So the new mouse position is in one quadrant and the last position is in another quadrant so subtracting these angles doesnt give me what I want.

Negative 153 pMy understanding about the reducer is that it processes one key, value pair from the intermediate op file of sort and shuffle. I dont know how to access that intermediate file which has the sorted amp shuffled key value pairs. Once I cannot access the intermediate file, I cannot write code in the reducer module to select the largest key. I have no clue as how to program the reducer which receives one K,V pair at a time to print only the largest key and its corresponding values to the final output file.p  pSuppose if this is the intermediate file from the mapper which has also undergone sort and shuffling ..p  p1 ap  p2 be top  p4 this whatp  pI would want the reducer to print only 4 this what in the final output file. Since the reducer does not have the entire file in its memory. Its not possible to write this logic in the reducer.

Negative 153 p[In Short]  I am looking for a mockup tool that allows to describe clickable buttons in the predefined wireframes and allows exporting as .apk .p  pAmong so many mockup tools available for Android most allow wireframe creation, live preview and then exporting as a set of images or pdf. Some however, allow exporting as an .apk as a highly premium feature like marvelapp.p  pI have already created my [highfidelity] wireframes using fireworksphotoshop. I need a tool that allows me put these wireframes in the mockup, describe clickable button areas in them and then open a new wireframe from it and repeat.p  pWhy  I recently interviewed for a [almost] major US based tech firm for a design position with their VP of Engineering. The guy gave me a project to show my skills and asked that he would love to see my wireframes in action on a real device which shows transitions and that there are tons of softwares out there that allows this without coding.p  pI have created apps before using Android Studio but, to breakup each of my wireframes and describe them in layout will be really hectic now. Are there really any tools to do that because Ive spent hours finding a good one. Should I go the long way p

Negative 153 pThe short question is does the framework Scrapy provide a way to do unit test More specific, a way to test processorsp  pThe long question is...p  pI have a bunch of processors declared in a processors.py file. These processors are used by the items loaders declared in loaders.py. As I am finding some bugs on the processors I would like to test them against some crafted cases. In Ruby on Rails the framework offers a simple way to do unit test.p  pIs there any easy way to test the processors in a similar way in Scrapyp  pBy now all my tests are hard coded in other files. But as I write more tests, I keep coding the same things again... So, I am sure someone somewhere has made up a solution for thisp

PHP works but when you have other applications that are not in PHP that access that information from your database they will get the wrong string  codecode.p  pIdeally you would want to have codecode everywhere.p  pstrongThe symptomstrongp  pIt seems that PDO doesnt have any notion of NVARCHAR, aka characters that are encoded using 16 bits. In fact, everything that you pass to or retrieve from SQL SERVER via PDO will be by chunk of 8 bits.

Negative 153 pIm going to implement a Web API to be consumed by mobile devices android, iOS and web applications. From what I understand about Web API, it should be clientagnostic, so no matter which client consumes it a mobile app, a web application, a console application, etc.p  pMy concern comes when a mobile developer suggested me to design all the API methods according the mobile app views. For example, in one view I need to display information about a user and its products, I think I need to create 2 methodsp  ul liusers231 li liusers231products1453li ul  pBut according the mobile developer I need to create strongonly one methodstrong that returns all the view data in only one callp  ul liviewsinitialviewsparamsli ul  pHis main argument is that we need to reduce calls to server. But the disadvantage I see, is that if at some point the screensviews change, well need to change the API, also other clients could implement different views structures. p  pIs it a good practice to provide API methods per view , only one call that returns all the data required in that view or is it better to handle atomicsingle responsability methods in API to be consumed by clients no matter how many calls clients do to the serverp  pPlease, guide me a little about this, and tell me if the multiple calls affect performance or have disadvantages. I think no matter how many calls client do, if the response from server is milliseconds. So client works with a composition of calls.p  pAny article or more references is welcomed too.
