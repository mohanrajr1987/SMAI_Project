Positive 53233 pI have a codeRecyclerViewcode with 30 items totally, 10 items are visible on the screen. I want to use setScrollPosition to scroll the codeRecyclerViewcodep  pBut when I pass a value,  For Example setScrollPosition5, the codeRecyclerViewcode is not getting scrolled by 5 items. But the scrolling initiates when I pass value 10 or above.p  pWhat is the reason for that delay  Is that because the codeRecyclerViewcode offset is at the lastvisibleposition  How to solve this issuep

So instead of using codeltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayoutgtcode just for FAB, we use it for the whole activity. As CoordinatorLayout focuses on making child views work coordinated, isnt it better if all elements work in coordination with one another What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing it either waysp

Positive 53233 pIt appears that children of the codeCollapsingToolbarLayoutcode a custom codeFrameLayoutcode do not adhere to the expected stack behavior of codeFrameLayoutcodes. I expect the views to be drawn on top of each other in the order they are provided in the XML layout.p  pIn the example below, when collapsing the codeCollapsingToolbarLayoutcode, the layoutbuttonbar codeLinearLayoutcode scrolls underneath the buttonfollow and buttonlike buttons. Provided that the codeLinearLayoutcode is defined after the above mentioned buttons, I expect the codeLinearLayoutcode to scroll over the two buttons, obscuring them, rather than below them.

Positive 53233 pIm displaying a set of items in a codeRecyclerViewcode. The data are downloaded from the server, and one group of items are downloaded for each time. However, sometimes only one group of data cannot fill the screen, so I want to make the codeRecyclerViewcode capable of detecting this problem, and start loading next group of data until the screen is filled. p  pFor example, if data of page 1 is not enough, load data of page 2. If still not, load data of page 3, and so on.p  pThe detection part is not difficult since I can get the parameters belowp  precode    int visibleItemCount  mLayoutManager.getChildCount     int totalItemCount  mLayoutManager.getItemCount     int firstVisibleItem  mLayoutManager.findFirstVisibleItemPosition codepre  pBut the problem comes with codenotifyDataSetChangedcode. For example, below is my code of setting datap  precodepublic void setDataList data     updataDatadata     mAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged     ififScreenNotFilled        loadNextGroupData  it calls setData recursively       codepre  pWhen the codeloadNextGroupDatacode is called, the codesetDatacode is called recursively. And it turns out that the size of data list keeps on expanding while the codevisibleItemCountcode is always zero, and nothing appears on the screen.p  pIf I delete the recursion part of code, the 1st group of data is loaded in to screen. I become very curious of the mechanism of codenotifyDataSetChangedcode.p  pSo is there a solution to get the codeRecyclerViewcode updated automatically when it does not fill the screenp

But in design view I still see it and there is no way to remove it.

Positive 53233 pSay youve a list of Strings. The number of Strings varies. Is there a way to randomly display these strings like in an Apple presentation when they show a bunch of features in a slide. See link for an example.p  pa hrefhttpwww.technobuffalo.com20110610iphone5featurehintedatinios5wwdcpresentation relnofollowhttpwww.technobuffalo.com20110610iphone5featurehintedatinios5wwdcpresentationap  pSo, text is randomly scattered but never overlaps. Spacing is pretty even. Some text is dim, some is bolder, big, small, etc. I couldnt find the name of this effect or these multiple combined effects if there even is onep  pI assume they do it manually in a slide of course, but I was wondering if there was a known way of doing this programmatically.p  pAny help would be much appreciatedp
Positive 53233 pI am creating a custom TitleBar which subclasses RelativeLayout and creates its view by inflating an xml layout file.

Now, I have no idea how to draw the rectangle on top of the first child the image, but below the other children, the TextViews. So I would like to draw the children in the orderp  ol liImageView first childli liComputed dark Rectli liTextViews all other childrenli ol  pI tried overriding dispatchDraw and then after the call to super.dispatchDrawcanvas, I drew the rectangle.

Negative 53233 pIm betting that someone has already solved this and maybe Im using the wrong search terms for google to tell me the answer, but here is my situation.p  pI have a script that I want to run, but I want it to run only when scheduled and only one at a time.  cant run the script simultaneously  p  pNow the sticky part is that say I have a table called myhappyschedule which has the data I need and the scheduled time.  This table can have can have multiple scheduled times even at the same time, each one would run this script.  So essentially I need a queue of each time the script fires and they all need to wait for each one before it to finish. sometimes this can take just a minute for the script to execute sometimes its many many minutesp  pWhat Im thinking about doing is making a script that checks myhappyschedule every 5 min and gathers up those that are scheduled, puts them into a queue where another script can execute each job or occurance in the queue in order.    Which all of this sounds messy.  p  pTo make this longer  I should say that Im allowing users to schedule things in myhappyschedule and not edit crontab.    p  pWhat can be done about this  File locks and scripts calling scriptsp

Negative 53233 pIm in the process of working on a user profile system for a website and am pondering what would be a better scalable approach to take. Ive come up with two solutions and am looking for either input or perhaps pointers to something I might have missed.p  pemThe following create table statements are not meant to be executable but are merely there to give an idea of the layout of the tables involved.emp  pMy initial thought was something like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE user     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,      useremail VARCHAR320,      userjoined DATATIME,     userlastseen DATATIME,      usernamefirst VARCHAR,     usernamelast VARCHAR,      usernamealias VARCHAR,      userlocationcountry VARCHAR,     userlocationregion VARCHAR,     userlocationcity VARCHAR       ...  codepre  pObviously this isnt very scalable at all and adding additional properties i annoying. The one advantage is I can quickly search for users matching a specific set of properties. Ive done a bit of looking around and this is a pretty common approach e.g. Wordpress.p  pMy second approach the one Im currently playing around with is much more scalable but Im a little concerned about performancep  precodeCREATE TABLE user     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,      useremail VARCHAR320   CREATE TABLE userprofile     userid INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,      visibility ENUMPRIVATE, PUBLIC,      name VARCHAR,     value VARCHAR  codepre  pUsing this approach every use has a set of key value pairs associated with it which makes adding additional properties trivial as well as loading the users profile when they login. However I lose all the type information I had in the first approach e.g. DATETIME is now stored as a formatted string so some searches become annoying. This does give me more control over selecting which properties the user wants publicly displayed.p  pWould a hybrid approach be better allowing me to balance the advantages and disadvantages of both methods What method does SO use Is there another approach to this that I havent thought of or missedp  pstrongExtensionstrong With a hybrid approach would it be advantageous to also insert the properties from the user table into the userprofile table to control their visibility to other users or could that possibly be seen as additional overheadp

Negative 53233 pIn our small development team we are adopting the agile way of developing our software. We try to stick to one month development cycles.p  pAt the beginning we play what we call the planning game. The idea is to filter out all the issues and find out the ones to be handled in the upcoming iteration. Here it is in a nutshell every person developer, user, analyst, etc., involved in the project, is more or less aware of all the minor and major issues. Also, everybody has a more or less definitive wishlist of issues to be fixed in the upcoming iteration.p  pEveryone takes several small square pieces of paper 5 to 10 and writes down all the important in his opinion issues  one issue per one piece. Now, all the pieces are stuck to a whiteboard, but not randomly. The left edge of the board is priority, while the bottom is complexity like Y and X axes. All the papers are sorted out based on priority and complexity. Thus, a simple and not urgent ends up in the left bottom corner, moderate complexity  priority  in the middle, and extremely complex but urgent in the righttop. Well, you get it...p  pAfter a bit of discussing and tossing the papers around we have all of them arranged properly on the whiteboard. Of course, we might get rid of some of the papers along the way, because we dont want to be overwhelmed.p  pOnce we are done we do not remove the papers. On the contrary, we let them stay during the iteration. After issue is fixed we put a big cross on the corresponding piece of paper. Personally, I really enjoy this step p  pWell, now the question do you practice anything like that in your team If you do, how effective do you find this approach, how much do you like it, have you met any problems with thisp  pP.S.p  pYes, this is subjective, but I personally really enjoy this game and it seems to help a bit during planning and even development phase to stay concentrated on the issue. So, your answers are really appreciated.p

I have a method that returns these objects in chunks, but then I marshall these using JAXB, the marshaller returns with an exception that these objects are no root elements.

Thoughts Obviously it would be cleaner if I move the prototype object into a separate areap  precode.TranslationUI  function options, container      function monkey         console.logblah blah blah           extend the default settings with the options object passed     this.settings  .extend,.TranslationUI.defaultSettings,options       set a reference for the container dom element     this.container  container      .extend.TranslationUI.prototype,                      init  function                 monkey                  editing flag                 this.editing  false                  init event delegates here for                  languagepicker                 this.settings.languageSelector, this.container.bindclick, self this, this.selectLanguage                                  call the init function     this.init  codepre  pSo while this works, the crappy part is that Im reiniting prototype every time that constructor runs. Im sure thats not efficient. But not sure how else to have the prototype methods have access to private functionsvariables of a certain instance.p

Negative 53233 pI understand that functions can have attributes. So I can do the followingp  precodedef myfunc     myfunc.attribute  1     printmyfunc.attribute  myfunc.attribute  1 codepre  pIs it possible by any means to make such a function behave as if it were an instance For example, Id like to be able to do something like thisp  precodex  cleverwrappermyfunc y  cleverwrappermyfunc x.attribute  5 y.attribute  9 x    I want this to print 6 from the 5 plus increment y    I want this to print 10 from the 9 plus increment codepre  pAs it stands, there is only one instance of the function, so codeattributecode only exists once. Modifying it by either codexcode or codeycode changes the same value. Id like each of them to have their own codeattributecode. Is that possible to do at all If so, can you provide a simple, functional examplep  pIt is important that I be able to access codeattributecode from inside of the function but have the value of codeattributecode be different depending on which instance of the function is called. Essentially, Id like to use codeattributecode as if it were another parameter to the function so that it could change the behavior of the function but not pass it in. Suppose that the signature of the function were fixed so that I cannot change the parameter list. But I need to be able to set the different values for codeattributecode and then call the functions in sequence. I hope that makes sense.p  pThe main answers seem to be saying to do something like thisp  precodeclass wrapperobject     def initself, target         self.target  target     def callself, args, kwargs         return self.targetargs, kwargs  def testa     return a  test.attribute  x  wrappertest y  wrappertest x.attribute  2 y.attribute  3 printx.attribute  printy.attribute printx3 printy7 codepre  pBut that doesnt work. Maybe Ive done it incorrectly, but it says that codetestcode does not have codeattributecode. Im assuming that its because codewrappercode actually has the attribute. p  pThe reason I need this is because I have a library that expects a function with a particular signature. Its possible to put those functions into a pipeline of sorts so that theyre called in order. Id like to pass it multiple versions of the same function but change their behavior based on an attributes value. So Id like to be able to add codexcode and codeycode to the pipeline, as opposed to having to implement a codetest1code function and a codetest2code function that both do almost exactly the same thing except for the value of the attribute. p

Negative 53233 pI have a button bounded on Validation.HasError property of a textblock. The textblock has a validation rule that checks the value entered by user. The purpose of the binding is that the button should be disabled if the user enters a wrong data.p  pThe problem is that the ValidationRule executes AFTER the binding. So when the user types a wrong value, the binding checks the HasError property of the textblock, which is FALSE, so the button is Enabled. And then the validationrule executes.

Negative 53233 pIve started learning WCF and Im already utterly confused. I did a bit of reading on factory pattern and I cant figure out how or why does codeChannelFactoryltgtcode implement it.p  pNamely, the whole idea of a factory pattern is that factory abstracts the creation and initialization of the product from the client and thus if new type of product is introduced, client code doesnt need to change and thus can immediately start using the new product.p  precodeChannelFactoryltIRequestChannelgt factory  new                      ChannelFactoryltIRequestChannelgtbinding, address IRequestChannel channel  factory.CreateChannel codepre  pThe following is not a valid code, but its just used to demonstrate that, as far as I can tell, codeChannelFactorycode doesnt bring any benefits over directly instantiating specific channel classp  precodeIRequestChannel channelnew RequestChannelClassbinding, address codepre  pa Only benefit of the first example  implementing the factory pattern  is that client code doesnt need to change in the event that the type of object returned by codefactory.CreateChannelcode is changed sometime in the future. p  pBut if thats the reason for implementing factory pattern, then any method returning an object should implement a factory pattern, just in case  the type of returned object ever changes in the future  p  pc Thus, if codeChannelFactoryltgt.CreateChannelcode really implemented factory pattern, then client code would be able to inform factory.GetFactory say via parameter of what type should an objectproduct returned by codefactory.CreateFactorycode bep  pd Similarly, as far as I can tell, ChannelFactory class also doesnt implement a factory patternp  pthank youp  pstrongREPLYING TO Justin Niessnerstrongp  blockquote   pb The Factory pattern doesnt   necessarily require you to be able to   specify the concrete type to be   created. It also allows for the   factory to determine the concrete type   based on the parameters passed to it   in this case, binding and address.p blockquote  pSo codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode choose a concrete type to return based on binding and address values I thought it always returns the same concrete type, regardless of address and binding valuesp  pAs Ive asked the other two posters, would you agree that if codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode always returned an instance of the same concrete type, regardless of the binding and address values, then codeChannelFactorycode wouldnt have a factory pattern implementedp  pbrp  pstrongREPLYING TO Kevin Nelsonstrongp  blockquote   pA There are 2 benefits. 1   implementing code doesnt have to   change if you start using a new   implementation of IRequestChannel.p blockquote  pTrue, but as Ive mentioned to other posters, if thats the only requirement for class to be qualified as a class implementing a factory pattern , then any class with a method  with an interface type  as return type  that creates and returns a concrete instance, implements a factory pattern As far as I can tell, factory pattern is when factory produces different products based on values somehow supplied by a client codep  pOn the other hand, if I correctly understood Steve Ellinger, then based on binding and address values  passed to constructor of codeChannelFactorycode, the call to codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode will choose the concrete type to return based on binding and address values supplied to constructor . If that is the case, then I can understand why we say codeChannelFactorycode implements factory patternp  pSo would you agree that if codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode always returned an instance of the same concrete type, regardless of the binding and address values, then codeChannelFactorycode wouldnt have a factory pattern implementedp  pbrp  pstrongREPLYING TO Steve Ellingerstrongp  blockquote   pIRequestChannel is implemented by the   abstract class RequestChannel.

Keep in mind, this also makes   WCF extensible and more flexible.p blockquote  pBut then we could claim that any class with a method  with an interface type  as return type  that creates and returns a concrete instance implements a factory patternp  blockquote   pc The client code does tell the   factory which to return, indirectly by   the passed binding and address.p blockquote  pI thought codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode will always return in instance of the same concrete type, regardless of the binding and address passed to constructor of codeChannelFactorycode.But youre saying that based on binding and address values  passed to constructor of codeChannelFactorycode, the call to codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode will return one of the following types  codeHttpChannelFactory.HttpRequestChannel ,ReliableRequestSessionChannel and StreamedFramingRequestChannelcodep  pIf that is the case, then I can understand why we say codeChannelFactorycode implements factory pattern p  pSo would you agree that if codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode always returned an instance of the same concrete type, regardless of the binding and address values, then codeChannelFactorycode wouldnt have a factory pattern implementedp  pstrongSECOND REPLY TO Steve Ellingerstrong  p  pa So depending on the binding and address values, codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode returns either codeHttpRequestChannelcode ,codeReliableRequestSessionChannelcode or codeStreamedFramingRequestChannelcode Or may it also return some other types also p  pb if client code will always use channel instance of the same type say codeHttpRequestChannelcode , then theres nothing wrong if instead of using codeChannelFactory.CreateChannelcode we directly instantiate codeHttpRequestChannelcode instancep  precode HttpRequestChannel channel  new HttpRequestChannel ...    codepre  pc BTW  any idea why msdn doesnt contain any entries describing codeHttpRequestChannelcode ,codeReliableRequestSessionChannelcode and StreamedFramingRequestChannel classesp

Negative 53233 pI am trying to get the knack of good system design. As there is no hard and fast rules for good system design, I request you to give me some valuable suggestions. I prepared an imaginary system and prepared a design for that. Please let me know if you think if this design is good or bad. Is there a better way I used Abstract Factory and Dependency Injection in the solution.p  pProblemp  pDesign a system which runs in cars and controls it. The requirement is to make a system for Volkswagen Golf controlling components like engine, electrical, gearbox etc.p  pThere can be different versions of Golf like BlueMotion, Twist, GT etc which uses different components. For example if GT uses engine a and electrical b, BlueMotion can use engine c and electrical d. p  pThe engines, electricals and other components in different cars could be similiar, or could be completely different. For example a Flat 4 CRDI Engine uses CRDI technology for fuel injection and have a certain behaviour to reduce vibration. A PumpeDuse V6 engine uses PD injection and its own method for reducing vibration which is completely different from Flat4 CRDI. The difference is not only in the handling the vibrations but also most of the aspects of Engine behaviour.p  pAs of now, the system model should handle the starting of Engine. Starting the engine means use power from the electrical system and crank the engine and keep idling. To start with, make a Golf GT with Pumpe Duse E250 Engine and BoschR10 Electrical system. However, many different series could be launched in the future and system should be able to extend the functionality and car models with minimal trouble.p  pUpdate Code edited as per suggestions.p  pCodep  precodeclass Electrical  public     virtual void OpenCircuit  0   class Engine  public     virtual void CrankElectrical   0   class CarComponentFactory  public     virtual Engine CreateEngine0     virtual Electrical CreateElectrical0   class PumpeDuseE250public Engine      virtual void CrankElectrical pEle              pElegtOpenCircuit         Do the crank        class BoschR10 public Electrical      virtual void OpenCircuit              Open the Circuit        class GTFactorypublic CarComponentFactory  public     virtual Engine CreateEngine              return new PumpeDuseE250           virtual Electrical CreateElectrical              return new BoschR10        class VWGolf      autoptrltEnginegt mpEngine     autoptrltElectricalgt mpElectrical       public     VWGolfEngine pEngine, Electrical pElectricalmpEnginepEngine, mpElectricalpElectrical                void Start              mpEnginegtCrankmpElectrical.get           VWGolf                       codepre  pExample for Creating Objectsp  precodevoid main      GTFactory Factory     VWGolf golfGTFactory.CreateEngine, Factory.CreateElectrical     golfGT.Start  codepre  pNote that the names like BoschR10 are imaginary. p

Negative 53233 pWe are using OpenMP libgomp in order to speed up some calculations in a multithreaded Qt application. The parallel OpenMP sections are located within two different threads, though in fact they never execute in parallel.

The calculation time is very high, while the processor load is low. Setting codeOMPWAITPOLICYcode hardly has any effect.p  pWe also tried moving all the omp sections to a single thread this is not a good solution for us, though, from an architectural point of view.

When codeOMPWAITPOLICY  PASSIVEcode, the calculation time remains low and the processor is idle 50 of time.p  pOdd enough, when we use omp within a single thread, the first loop parallelized using omp in a series of omp calulations executes 10 times slower compared to the multithread case.p  pstrongUpdstrong Our questions are p  pa is there any way to reuse the openmp threads when using omp in the context of different threads.p  pb Why executing with codeOMPWAITPOLICY  PASSIVEcode slows everything.

Negative 53233 pIm doing some research on WPF and MVVM to evaluate if this is something we wish to implement in a project.p  pThere is one particular thing that I quite cannot understand my book on WPF hasnt arrived yet.p  pIve read Josh Smiths article WPF Apps With The ModelViewViewModel Design Pattern and also his article Using RoutedCommands with a ViewModel in WPF.p  pMy demo application is somewhat different from Josh Smiths demo in that I have menu items that arent directly bound to the main view model, but would rather be handled by other viewmodels.p  pMy main window is bound to a MainViewModel object which exposes a object called View derived from a ViewModelBase class and bound to the Main Window through a ContentControl. This View object is replaced with different ViewModels such as CustomerViewModel, CustomersViewModel etc. these are rendered using views defined in my resource dictionary .p  pAll this is well and find, but since I want menu items in my main window such as New, Save etc. that should be enabled, disabled based on the view I found Josh Smiths article on the CommandSink pattern but he states that it is obsolete, and one should rather use the RelayCommand.p  pNow I am confused, as I cannot figure out how to implement this functionality using this approach.p  pThanks, Vincentp
Negative 53233 pIs there a way to easily extract the DCT coefficients and quantization parameters from encoded images and video  Any decoder software must be using them to decode blockDCT encoded images and video.  So Im pretty sure the decoder knows what they are.  Is there a way to expose them to whomever is using the decoderp  pIm implementing some video quality assessment algorithms that work directly in the DCT domain.  Currently, the majority of my code uses OpenCV, so it would be great if anyone knows of a solution using that framework.  I dont mind using other libraries perhaps libjpeg, but that seems to be for still images only, but my primary concern is to do as little formatspecific work as possible I dont want to reinvent the wheel and write my own decoders.  I want to be able to open any videoimage H.264, MPEG, JPEG, etc that OpenCV can open, and if its block DCTencoded, to get the DCT coefficients. p  pIn the worst case, I know that I can write up my own block DCT code, run the decompressed framesimages through it and then Id be back in the DCT domain.  Thats hardly an elegant solution, and I hope I can do better.p  pPresently, I use the fairly common OpenCV boilerplate to open imagesp  precodeIplImage image  cvLoadImagefilename  Run quality assessment metric codepre  pThe code Im using for video is equally trivialp  precodeCvCapture capture  cvCaptureFromAVIfilename     while cvGrabFramecapture      IplImage frame  cvRetrieveFramecapture      Run quality assessment metric on frame  cvReleaseCaptureampcapture codepre  pIn both cases, I get a 3channel codeIplImagecode in BGR format.

Negative 53233 pCaveat Im using ColdFusion, but I feel this is could cover a broad range of languages, as this is more of a programming question, not just a ColdFusion question.p  pOk, I have been tasked with implementing code to apply promotions to items in a shopping cart. Basically, there can be any number of promotions for any number of items  i.e. Buy 2 of item ABC, get 1 of item ABC 50 off. However, there can also be buy strong3strong of item ABC, get 1 of item ABC free. Or even buy 2 of item ABC, get 1 of item XYZ 50 off.p  pSo, imagine there are more promotions running like this across a broad range of products.p  pNow, I need to run through every scenario possible to apply the promotion or promotionS that give the customer the best possible value the lowest subtotal.p  pHowever, I cannot figure out how to write the code that will run through EVERY possible scenario. I am able to narrow the number of promotions that eligible, by filtering out those that do not apply to the items in the cart. Obviously, I also know the number of eligible items in the cart. p  pSo, lets say I have 5 items in my cart, and 3 of those items have eligible promotions such as those above. 1 item has 3 possible promotions, another has 4 possible promotions, another has 2 possible promotions. My first thought is, loop through each possible promotion, and within that loop, loop though each possible order of eligible itemsp  p123 132 213 231 312 321p  p...and apply the promotions each time, saving the combination that produces the lowest subtotal.p  pWill this work Is it overkill Does anyone have a better suggestionp  pAny code samples would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 53233 pIm hoping someone can help me out with this annoyance.p  pAt work we have two independent website projects that share a common MasterPage. The MasterPage is embedded in a class library that both projects reference. We use a custom VirtualPathProvider that lets us reference the MasterPage in each project. This works fine at runtimecompiletime, but it breaks intellisense inside the aspx page markup. p  pWhen I set the MasterPageFile property to EmbeddedMasterPage.Master, Visual Studio shows a red squiggley error under it saying Path not found, with a directory indicating that its trying to find that file inside the website projectas opposed to the class library project. Since Visual Studio cant figure out where the MasterPage is, its causing all of the intellisense to break. It wont show anything for the  tags. In fact, the only intellisense it will give me is for basic html tags. From Googling around, the only information I could find is that VS cant find the root htmlheadbody tags in the embedded MasterPage. I couldnt find a way to fix it, though.p  pThis happens in both Visual Studio 2008 and 2010. p  pstrongUpdate4102011strongp  pFor the time being, Im having to copy the embedded masterpage to the actual site project in order to get it to work.

The html should be inside each unique div pertaining to its instance window.pli lipEach menu button should modify its divs display to block, bringing the instance window for that button to front, but hiding all others.pli lipEach instance window has to be flexible enough to run javascript within it, so I must be able to create additional mvcs within each unique div.pli lipOkay, last comment.  Should my user interface utilize mvc or is it not neccessary. Also, If it did use mvc whats the best way to acomplish this.

The form will be used by unexperienced users so my focus lies on good usability. Therefor I am providing a hint to every input field with further instructions. To show the hints I am using the onfocusonblur javascript event, so only one hint at a time is shown. This worked well when I only had input fields of codetypetextcode, but with input fields of codetyperadiocode I am experiencing troubles in google chrome.p  pI made a strongquick example on a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net54y691 relnofollowjsfiddle.netastrong so you can see what I mean. The code there is very similar to the code I use in my form, so I didnt bother to post it here. The alert pops up in every browser I tested so far except google chrome. I wonder why Is there any known solution or workaround to itp

Negative 53233 pReferring to a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net25EsV relnofollowthis fiddlea.  This animation is quite smooth on Chrome and IE v9, however it is very choppy on Firefox.  The whole idea is to animate the border without moving the div itself referring back to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6313847jqueryanimateborderwithoutmovingdivthisa question.  Question is, any possible way to achieve the same animation but in a smoother fashion like that in ChromeIE in Firefox  p  pThis is the case even if you animate just one side of the codedivcode, so its not because we are trying to animate every side at once.  If we look at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netc3Fw8 relnofollowthis fiddlea in Firefox, it seems that the margins being animated is not too smooth, which seems to be the problem.  p  pAny workout is appreciated.p

Negative 53233 pI just got a requirement to create a small I assume standalone utility to hit some code in our web application to do some custom processing of files from the app and then dump the files into a shared drive. My question is what is the best way for doing this Do I just create a small app and then jar it up and run it off a command line or is there a better wayp  pSorry, I didnt give enough detail. Its an old application, like over 10 years, so while its been upgraded to jdk 1.6, most of the code uses the old collections, old loops, etc... There arent any interfaces, very tightly coupled code that uses inheritance with lots of nested objects. The web app will do the processing. I think what they want is create some code outside of the application code that will login and then fire off the file processing code. Prior to this I had upgraded their version of Windward Reports in a separate branch and they want to make sure that the processed files contracts, forms, etc.. dont get altered greatly as there are legal requirements on fonts and layouts. So this utility will go in, fire off the list of reports a few thousand dump it to a share drive so they can view them with another tool for comparision based on rules you can automate with that commercial tool, en masse. I was thinking create a small class with a main method, then jar it up and while the web server is running with my upgraded branch code, run the utility off the command line to fire it off. p
Negative 53233 pIm working on an app that displays entries in a Core Data table by dollar figure. I sorted my table by a dollar figure attribute.

I populated the database, and they sort correctlyp  p5p  p10p  p25p  p50p  p100p  pNow I just have to append a dollar sign to the section index title.p  pI thought I would do something like this...p  precode NSArray sectionIndexTitlesForTableViewUITableView tableView       NSArray frcSectionTitlesArray  [fetchedResultsController sectionIndexTitles]      NSString dollarSectionName  [NSString stringWithFormatf, frcSectionTitlesArray]      return dollarSectionName   codepre  pBut of course that doest work because Im dealing with an array, and not a string.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 53233 pIm trying to write some generic structures. Essentially, what I need for my purpose is C templates, but since Im writing in C, templates are out of consideration. Currently Im considering 2 ways of achieving what I want.p  pMethod 1 use the preprocessor. Like sop  precodedefine DEFINEPAIRT typedef struct PairT                             T x                             T y                           PairT  DEFINEPAIRint  int main    Pairint p    return 0  codepre  pAn obvious downside to it is that you have to invoke the macro before using the type. Probably there are more disadvantages, which I hope you will point out.p  pMethod 2 just use voidpointers, like sop  precodetypedef struct Pair    void x    void y  Pair codepre  pObviously, this approach is not type safe I could easily pass a pair of strings to a function expecting a pair of doubles, plus the code doing deallocation gets a lot messier with this approach.p  pI would like to hear your thoughts on this. Which of the two methods is betterworse and why Is there any other method I could use to write generic structures in Cp  pThanks.p

Negative 53233 pIm sorry if this questions seems trivial but Ive been Googleing for a few days with no success. p  pIm new to WebServices and Ive been assigned to develop the server part for a web service in Java. I was given a WSDL and with maven and cxf I built a project with two modules. A core module where Ive written business code and intend to do the web service server part and a wsdl module where the classes are generated from the WSDL. p  pNow, after writing the business code and testing it I have to deploy the web service server under JBoss for further testing with soapUI. Ive never done this and trying to google a tutorial has made me really confused as I cant seem to find out a good exampletutorial  most being made using different technologies. p  pI think I have to configure a web.xml and a cxf.xml and create an endpoint pointing to my service implementation  a class that implements the service interface created from the WSDL but I have no idea how to do this. p  pI also notice that the WSDL created a Serviceservice class that extends Service.

Negative 53233 pI am embarking on a programming project that will need to confirm device identity of removable media e.g. usb thumb drives before it will go on to do a bunch of other cool stuff.  p  pSome friends of mine pointed me towards using the Serial Number, and preliminary testing using the udevadm command indicates that this should work.  I did some additional checking and it appears that if I can get the software working with libudev then it should minimally compile on ubuntu, slackware and gentoo, which would be a really nice benefit.  p  pSo I used bing to find a tutorial and got the Signal 11 site httpwww.signal11.usossudev its a very wellwritten tutorial.  It actually seems to have everything I need.  I download the code.  Fix a couple of platformspecific bugs and then compile.  BOOM  Gcc compiles without errors.  So far so good.p  pBut when I try to run it, it kicks up a couple of bugs, and I realize that I need to read some more tutorials so that I can understand libudev well enough to fix the bugs, and to turn out working software.  Problem is that there really ISNT any other tutorials that I can find and the kernel.org site that is the only known site of the library documentation is down after a recent server compromise.p  pI considered just issuing udevadm directives to system and then parsing results, but thats a really hackish way to put software together, and I am planning on releasing this to the community when Im finished writing.p  pSo how best for me to learn libudevp

Negative 53233 pIm implementing a function in my Android app where the user is able to dynamically add and remove views in a codeFrameLayoutcode and position them with absolute coordinates by using drag and drop techniques. The user will typically load a floor planning image as background to the codeFrameLayoutcode and then add buttons that represents lamps in the house and position them where appropriate.p  pAnyway, I have a problem where I need to inflate and add views to the codeFrameLayoutcode when the codeFragmentcode is loaded. The child views are derived from information in a SQLite database. In order to position the child views correctly depending on orientation I need to take the width and height of the codeFrameLayoutcode in account. Therefore, I am unable to do this work in codeonCreateViewcode in my codeFragmentcode.p  pThe codeFrameLayoutcode is actually a codeDragAreacode I will still refer to this object as the codeFrameLayoutcode though, for simplicity, a custom class extending codeFrameLayoutcode. In order to get a callback to the codeFragmentcode when the widthheight has been calculated I override codeonSizeChangedcode in codeFrameLayoutcode which calls the codeFragmentcode.p  pAnd heres the strange thing. If I, in the callback method in my codeFragmentcode, create the views and call codeFrameLayout.invalidatecode nothing seems to happen. Inspection says the views has been added to the codeFrameLayoutcode but they are not seen. If I open the hierarchyviewer and press Load View Hierarchy the views appears. So there seems to be a side effect here which draws the views. I have tried to call codeFrameLayout.requestLayoutcode and also make sure its running on the UI thread by doing the logic in codegetActivity.runOnUiThreadcode but it makes no difference. p  pstrongBUTstrong If I instead place the logic inside codeonPostExecutedcode in a otherwise useless codeAsyncTaskcode the views are drawn. p  pPlease see the code below where this is further described in the comments. The callback method is named codeonWidthAvailablecode and called from codeFrameLayout.onSizeChangedcode.p  pI have also tried to called codeinvalidatecode at a later, arbitrary point in time with no luck.p  precodepublic class ImageFragment extends Fragment implements FragmentRedrawable, OnLongClickListener, OnWidthAvailableListener   ...

Negative 53233 pa hrefhttpwww.graphpad.com relnofollowMy companya has created GraphPad Prism, a widely used program for scientists to analyze data and make technical graphs. Often scientists will export graphs from GraphPad Prism for submission to scientific journals. The format most journals want these days is EPS, and we export vectorbased EPS files. But fonts are an issue. p  pWe offer an option to embed fonts into the EPS file. What we mean by this is that text is converted to outlines or glyphs. These EPS files can be opened on other computers that lack the original fonts. But the journal production people cant edit the text, change font size, etc. when they work on these EPS files. p  pMy programmers tell me that the term embedding fonts means exactly what we do  convert to outlinesglyphs. p  pThe people at a company that does page production for many scientific journals use a different definition of embed. They want text to remain as text in the EPS file, but for the font definitions to be included in the EPS file. That way they dont need the original fonts, but can tweak spelling, font size, and even change fonts while preparing an EPS image for publication. p  pMy programmers tell me that that second definition of embed is an Adobespecific method not available to us. p  pSo my question is this Where can we find specifications or example code to let us embed fonts into an EPS file using the second definition leave text as text and also include the TrueType font definitionsp

Negative 53233 pIn the MongoDB documentation for autosharding it says Sharding is performed on a percollection basis.

Our DB system is looking at approximately 100,000,000 page views per month.p  pIn that scenario will sharding ever activate since the collections are never big enough even though the DB usage and site traffic is certainly high enough to require load balancing.

Negative 53233 pA Django site hosted on Webfaction that serves around 950k pageviews a month is experiencing crashes that I havent been able to figure out how to debug. At unpredictable intervals averaging about once per day, but not at the same time each day, all requests to the site start to hangtimeout, making the site totally inaccessible until we restart Apache. These requests appear in the frontend access logs as 499s, but do not appear in our applications logs at all.p  pIn poring over the server logs including those generated by djangotimelog I cant seem to find any pattern in which pages are hit right before the site goes down. For the most recent crash, all the pages that are hit right before the site went down seem to be standard rendertoresponse operations using templates that seem pretty straightforward and work well the rest of the time. The requests right before the crash do not seem to take longer according to timelog, and I havent been able to replicate the crashes intentionally via load testing.p  pWebfaction says that isnt a case of overrunning our allowed memory usage or else they would notify us. One thing to note is that the database is not being restarted just the appApache when we bring the site back up.p  pHow would you go about investigating this type of recurring issue It seems like there must be a line of code somewhere thats hanging  do you have any suggestions about a process for finding itp
Negative 53233 pTwo related ASP.NET Web Service JSON questions here. Im using a Ntier designed ASP.NET 2.0  application.p  hr  pQuestion 1br  I am trying to get my ASP.NET web service to generate a multiple object JSON response where each object has multiple objects returned. Im not sure if I am explaining that properly, so here is an example of what I am looking for.p  precode[     id1, CommentDataElement Value,         OldData Description ABC, Status 0 ,         NewData ShortText Text here, LongText More text here      ,     id2, CommentDataElement Value,         OldData Description DEF, Status 1 ,         NewData ShortText Text here, LongText More text here      ,     id3, CommentDataElement Value,         OldData Description GHI, Status 2      ,     id4, CommentDataElement Value,         NewData ShortText Text here, LongText More text here       ] codepre  pcodeidcodes 1 and 2 have both codeOldcode and codeNewcode datasets, while codeidcode 3 only has an codeOldcode dataset and codeidcode 4 only has a codeNewcode dataset.p  pI would then use jQuery to handle this response. And based on the existence of the codeOldcode and codeNewcode datasets, I would generate the proper page elements.p  pThe source of the codeOldDatacode and codeNewDatacode are in two different tables. So is this possible to dop  hr  pQuestion 2br  In addition, is it possible to have an ASP.NET web service return a JSON string with two different object structures Example.p  precode[     ...same as above, just cut out for brevity...     id4, CommentDataElement Value,         NewData ShortText Text here, LongText More text here      ,     Count100 ] codepre  pBasically what I want to do, is make one request to the server, get my truncated dataset based on paging, say only returning 20 records of the full set and get the full record set count so that I can generate my page numbers pagination. On my Data Access Layer, is it possible to use a return statement for the record set and an codeOUTPUTcode parameter for the full count Just a thought.p  hr  pIm pretty sure that the JSON that I have written here is not proper.

Negative 53233 pWhen writing a C application, I normally limit myself to C specific language features. Mostly this means using STL instead of CRT where ever possible.p  pTo me, STL is just so much more fluid and maintainable than using CRT. Consider the followingp  precodestdstring str Hello  if str  Hello   ...  codepre  pThe CRuntime equivalent would bep  precodechar const str  Hello if strcmp str, Hello   0   ...  codepre  pPersonally I find the former example much easier to look at. Its just more clear to me whats going on. When I write a first pass of my code, the first thing on my mine is always to write code in the most natural way.p  pOne concern my team has with the former example is the dynamic allocation. If the string is static OR has already been allocated elsewhere, they argue it doesnt make sense to potentially cause fragmentation or have a wasteful allocation here. My argument against this is to write code in the most natural way first, and then go back and change it after getting proof that the code causes a problem.p  pAnother reason I dont like the latter example is that it uses the C Library. Typically I avoid it at all costs simply because its not C, its less readable, and more error prone and is more of a security risk.p  pSo my question is, am I right to avoid it the C Runtime Should I really care about the extra allocation at this step in coding Its hard for me to tell if Im right or wrong in this scenario.p

Negative 53233 pI have a problem with Hectors handling of controlcharacters in Key and Column names.

Negative 53233 pI would like to set the minwidth on a contenteditable div with some other elements next to it that must stay inline with the div.p  pEvery solution Ive seen uses inlineblock, but I cant use inlineblock behavior. When inlineblock starts wrapping, it still behaves like a block element, and I need the div to behave as an inline element. I would imagine the solution would require more than just CSS, but it seems very difficult to set any event for when the divs text changes. A solution involving javascript andor jQuery would be welcome.p  pEDIT Heres a simplified version of what Im trying to do.

Negative 53233 pWe are looking for a way to download concurrently in the background various resources that our game will need soon. Our requirements are 1 maximum possible download speed, 2 minimum possible disruption of foreground Runloop activities that are driving the game, 3 the solution works extremely well on all the major platforms of interest to us AndroidiOSPCMac, and 4 absence of bugs that debilitate the solution.p  pIf we dont meet requirement 1, then the game has to stop and make the user wait until the background download catches up and delivers the requisite resources. If we dont meet requirement 2, then the background download negatively impacts how the game plays, making it jerky or slowtorespond, etc.p  pWeve tried and investigated various approaches, including Asset Bundles, WWW, and native C HttpWebRequest, and non of them meet all of our requirements. Details below.p  pWed love to chat with you if youve already figured out how to solve this problem, because wed rather not reinvent the wheel.p  pHere are the details of our experience so farp  pWe have an Android app built in Unity  eventually to also be available via iOS. Alongside the normal foreground activities, we have a background low priority activity of downloading various resources to be used by the app in the foreground.p  pBefore you ask, Asset Bundles will not work for us as  unless anything has changed recently  they do not work across different versions of Unity  i.e. an asset bundle for Unity 3.4 does not work in Unity 3.5. So an upgrading user will have to redownload all their assets all over again.p  pUnfortunately, we have discovered a number of annoying bugs with using the WWW component. These include not updating when there is a loss of network, and no return values from web requests i.e. post. As such, we are looking to replace our use of WWW with the native C HttpWebRequest. Unfortunately, we have found using this component in the main Unity Runloop via a coroutine causes the runloop to stall and the UI to freeze.p  pBut placing this same code in a background C thread not a coroutine and then polling that threads activity does seem to work.p  pWe do not like this approach as this does allow us to schedule this activity in away which is in harmony with the Unity scheduler. We would like the network and associated CPU activity to be run in appropriate gaps in the Unity Run Loop. But as far as we can tell, there are only three ways we can specify priorityp  ul liWWW.threadPriority  we do not want to use WWW so this is mute.li liApplication.backgroundLoadingPriority  As we are not using a Unity component like AssetBundles to do the downloading, I am assuming this has no effectli liYieldInstructions e.g. WaitForSeconds and WaitForFixedUpdate  My understanding is that these are fairly dumb. They run when they are scheduled to run and do not defer to the needs of the Unity Run Loopli ul  pWhat we are looking to understand  Is WWW really fraught with problems or is this just our use of the component  Has anyone used HttpWebRequest w a Unity app successfully Have they done so in a threaded fashion  Is there any interrupt or priority architecture in Unity so that background tasks can play nicely w the Unity Runloop and not cause glitches or competitionp

I believe this is so because there is no guarantee that the two domain names are the same in the different formats.  For example, in the company where I work, the codedomaincode part of the codedomainusernamecode format is based upon deparment, but in the codeusernamedomaincode, its the company name.  Its the kind of thing that requires a DNS lookup.p  pI was hoping that there was an API that did this DNS lookup.  I guess I should have put this information into my original question.  Sorry.p

Negative 53233 pI have several views with a lot of subviews, and during animation the performance is very poor.p  pOne way that could help is to flatten the hierarchy by rendering it to a context. For this to work, each of the views which I want to be able to flatten must be constructed in such a way that all of their subviews are added to a container rather than directly to the view. Also, I must implement drawRect which performs the flattening of the hierarchyp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect      CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext     [self.containerLayer renderInContextcontext]  codepre  pThe trick is that this container layer is not added as a sublayer of codeself.layercode. For Core Animation it then looks like the hierarchy is flat.p  pBut before trying something like this, is there a better way of doing itp  pWhat concerns me is that I have to create an extra container layer which holds my view hierarchy for the view I want to flatten on demand. drawRect gets called only when I call setNeedsDisplay so this seems fine.p  pIs there a way to flatten a views subviews without the need for such a containerp  pThe problem is that many of my subviews get added by calling addSubview, so there is no single layer I could flatten other than codeself.layercode itself, if I wouldnt have a container instead.p  pWhat if I did thisp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect      CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext     [self.layer renderInContextcontext]  codepre  pThis would not make much sense would it I mean the entire hierarchy of subviews would be attached to this layer, but this layer is tied into the view, so rendering it into context is superflous as the view hierarchy will not be flat.p

Negative 53233 pI have something like the StackOverflows Ask Question page, where a textbox is used to put source markup code and, below, another textbox noneditable is used to render a preview of the postquestion being typed.p  pConsider that my application not only lets me use a simple tiny markup language for my posts content it also provides me with the possibility to type math in it using a hrefhttpwww.mathjax.org relnofollowMathJaxa. But the syntax is simple Latex syntax however this is not the problem, so do not let this thing bother you too much.p  h3The problemh3  pThe problem is the following. The page is a little different from the StackOverflows one because it uses ASP.NET with AJAX in order to call a serverside procedure that performs the markup language translation in HTML this is my choice, I have the code serverside, there is no implementation in javascript of the markup translation code.p  pWhen the asynchronous script runs every 10 secs, the noneditable textbox is refilled with the translated markup. The Latex code as well is put there no translation performed on it and MathJax script is called everytime the AJAX procedure returns so the latex code will be rendered after the markup language, this latex rendering happens clientside. p  pThe problem is that, sometimes, rendered math is strange especially considering equation numberings. Numbers do increase every new AJAX call. I guess there must be a way to reset, completely, the status of the MathJax object instantiated in the page or whatever... Is there a way to reset MathJaxp  pI assume that AJAX here is the problem... Thankyou for your help, hope I was clear.p

Negative 53233 pI need to read and interpret a binary file containing a TIFF image. I know there exist readers for doing this but I want to go the hard way. I found the TIFF format description and need to parse the binary file in small chunks. Assume I was able to read in memory the complete binary file. This means that I have a variable containing one long list of bytes. I know via the format definition what the meaning is of the different groups of n bytes.p  pHow can one define character variables with different lengths sometimes 2, sometimes 3, sometimes 4 etc. so that the variable address points to the right position in the image variable arrayp  pWith other words, assume my image is loaded into an array Image containing all bytes of the file. The first 2 bytes I want to load in a string with length 2 bytes so that I can just link the address pointer to the first position in the Image array and automatically the first 2 bytes are associated with the first character string. A second string of 4 bytes would have another meaning and so I make the address for the second string of 4 bytes point to the 3rd position of the Image array.p  pIs this feasible in C I remember that this was a normal way of working for dynamical memory allocation in Fortran 77 in a simulation code I analysed a long time ago.p  pThanks in advance for the hintsp  pRegards,p  pStefan  p

Negative 53233 pI have a small Clojure consumerpublisher receiving messages, processing them and sending them off to other consumers, all via RabbitMQ.p  pIve defined a messagehandler that handles messages in a separate thread separate from the main thread that is.

In the past I have had no problems creating a project with it, but this time every request takes at least 1 second, which is ofcourse way too long.p  pI cant give you the entire code, but Ill share as much as possible. The requests are as followsp  precode    Update the navigation screen       function UpdateNavigation           .ajax             type POST,             url applicationcontrollersLocationController.php,             dataType json,             data actionGetSurroundings,             success functiondata                 directionnorth.htmltypeof data.north  undefined  data.north    ltbrgt North                 directionwest.htmltypeof data.west  undefined  data.west    ltbrgt West                 directioncenter.htmltypeof data.center  undefined  data.center    ltbrgt Center                 directioneast.htmltypeof data.east  undefined  data.east    ltbrgt East                 directionsouth.htmltypeof data.south  undefined  data.south    ltbrgt South                                 Update the current location       navigationlist button.clickfunctionevent          if event.target.id  directioncenter             return           .ajax             type POST,             url applicationcontrollersLocationController.php,             data actionSetLocationampvalue  event.target.id,             success function                  UpdateNavigation                            codepre  pAs far as I know this could is fine. It might be a good idea to change it a little but it shouldnt cause the delay as far as I know. The LocationController file is pretty big, but it uses a switch for different cases so the actual executed code isnt that big.p  pUsing FireBug I found out that its waiting for 1.01 seconds for the first request, and 1.00 second for the second request. I did some research and people told me that this might be because the server is too busy to handle your request properly so thats why its taking so long. But that seems unlikely because the code and database are hosted locally. There shouldnt be a conflict in requests either since they are executed one at a time.p  pIm at a loss here. I have no idea how to start debugging this problem. Deleting parts of the code didnt help because it would either stop executing alltogether or just take 1 second. This leads me to believe the code is not the problem, although I could be wrong.p  pAny help would be greatly apreciated If you need more information, please dont hesitate to ask.p  pEdit Some more digging around leads me to believe the queries inside the code may be at fault If so, Im using the following pretty ugly queriesp  precodeSELECT      characterlocation.block,     characterlocation.location FROM     characterlocation WHERE     characterlocation.id  1 LIMIT     1    SELECT      zones.name,     zones.location,     zones.block FROM     zones WHERE                  zones.location  .getBlock[location].  1         AND             zones.block  .playerBlock.      OR                  zones.location  .getBlock[location].         AND             zones.block  .playerBlock.      OR                  zones.location  .getBlock[location].  1         AND             zones.block  .playerBlock.      OR                  zones.location  .getBlock[location].

Negative 53233 pI have been trying to do some network programming in Linux but I seem to be stuck again. I dont seem to get the first argument of the select function.  It should be the last made socket codefiledescriptor  1code as far as I know.  Mostly the highest codefiledescriptorcode contains the number 6. When I add the codefiledescriptorcode to the codefdsetcode it suddenly changes to 64probably because it changes to codefdbytescode correct me if Im wrong. So, 61 does not seem to make it for the select statement because it keeps blocking, but not if I get the codefdbytescode from the codefdsetcode.

Negative 53233 pIve had problems with variables overwriting each other in memory, so I decided Id try to allocate one of my arrays dynamically.p  pIn the simplified code below, Im strongattemptingstrong to create an array of integers using dynamic allocation, then have a function edit the values within that array of integers.

Negative 53233 pIve been trying to create a codeMessageBoxcode with changeable, readable text and customizable buttons, I think making a hook for it would probably be easy for this but I read at MSDN p  pHooks tend to slow down the system because they increase the amount of processing the system must perform for each message. You should install a hook only when necessary, and remove it as soon as possible. p  pIm wondering whether its really worth it when I can just use codeCreateWindowExcode to make an imitation codeMessageBoxcode that does all I want. How much do hooks really slow the system down, is it worth it or should I be going with codeCreateWindowExcode insteadp

The following SQL script produces the result set of the query Ill post momentarily  Also, I dont have SQL Server 2012.p  precodecreate table test patid int, caldate date, grpnbr int, drugqty int,[ranking] int go insert into testpatid,caldate, grpnbr,drugqty,[ranking] values 1, 182007,7,2, 1, 1, 192007,7,2, 1, 1, 1102007,7,  2,1, 1, 1112007,7,  2,1, 1, 1122007,7,  2,1, 1, 1132007,7,  2,1, 1, 1142007,7,  2,1, 1, 1152007,7,  2,1, 1, 612007,7,2, 1, 1, 622007,7,2, 1, 1, 632007,7,2, 1 codepre  pNotice here that there are two noncontiguous intervals where this person was on two drugs at once.  In the days that are omitted,drugqty was more than two.  The last column in this example was my attempt at adding another field that I could group by to help solve the problem didnt work.p  pQuery to create tablesp  precode CREATE TABLE [dbo].[rx]             [patid] [int] NOT NULL,             [fillDate] [date] NOT NULL,             [scriptEndDate]  AS dateaddday,[dayssup],[filldate],             [drugName] [varchar]50 NULL,             [daysSup] [int] NOT NULL,             [quantity] [float] NOT NULL,             [drugClass] [char]3 NOT  NULL,             CHECKfillDate ltscriptEndDate PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED               [clmid] ASC    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Calendar]              [caldate] [date] PRIMARY KEY, [Year] AS YEARcaldate PERSISTED, [Month] AS MONTHcaldate PERSISTED, [Day] AS DAYcaldate PERSISTED,              [julianseq] AS 1DATEDIFFDD, CONVERTDATE, CONVERTvarchar,YEARcaldate0101,caldate,      id int identity codepre  pthe query Im using to produce my result setsp  precodeWITH x       AS SELECT rx.patid,                  c.caldate,                  CountDISTINCT rx.drugname AS distinctDrugs           FROM   rx,                  calendar AS c           WHERE  c.caldate BETWEEN rx.filldate AND rx.scriptenddate                  AND rx.ofinterest  1           GROUP  BY rx.patid,                     c.caldate           the query example I used having count1 2, but to illustrate the noncontiguous intervals, in practice I need the below having statement          HAVING Count gt 1,       y       AS SELECT x.patid,                  x.caldate                  c2.id is the row number in the calendar table.                  ,                  c2.id  Rownumber                            OVER                              partition BY x.patid                              ORDER BY x.caldate AS grpnbr,                  distinctdrugs           FROM   x,                  calendar AS c2           WHERE  c2.caldate  x.caldate  SELECT ,         Rank           OVER             partition BY patid, grpnbr             ORDER BY distinctdrugs AS [ranking]  FROM   y  WHERE  y.patid  1604012867         AND distinctdrugs  2  codepre  pBesides the fact that I shouldnt have a column in the calendar table named id, is there anything egregiously wrong with this approach  I can get the query to show me the distinct intervals of distinctDrugsx, but it will only work for that integer and not anything 1.  By this I mean that I can find the separate intervals where a patient is on two drugs, but only when I use 2 in the having clause, not 1.  I cant do something likep  precodeSELECT patid,         Mincaldate,         Maxcaldate,         distinctdrugs  FROM   y  GROUP  BY patid,            grpnbr  codepre  pbecause this will pick up that second group of noncontiguous dates.  Does anyone know of an elegant solution to this problemp

Negative 53233 pIs there something safer than JSP  I havent found any meaningful answers through Google. We currently use the Spring MVC framework and JSP to render HTML. I have came to hate the dynamic nature of the JSP rendering, in that you reference a model like codemodel.someAttributecode but have no way of telling whether this attribute is available at the given module or specifies the type of the model that the template expects. It becomes very difficult to refactor the models getters since Eclipse doesnt know which templates use the model and also cannot relate the getters to the property accessors in templates.p  pIs there a templating technology out there, that is both less ugly than spitting out HTML code via imperative code and more typecompile safe than JSPs p

Negative 53233 pIm reading, in a simple way, how do TLBs work and I dont understand somethingp  blockquote   pThe TLB references physical memory addresses in its table. It may   reside between the CPU and the CPU cache, between the CPU cache and   primary storage memory, or between levels of a multilevel cache. The   placement determines whether the cache uses physical or virtual   addressing. If the cache is virtually addressed, requests are sent   directly from the CPU to the cache, and the TLB is accessed only on a   cache miss. If the cache is physically addressed, the CPU does a TLB   lookup on every memory operation and the resulting physical address is   sent to the cache.p blockquote  pSummary When the TLB is between CPU and CPU cache it uses physical addressing and the CPU does a TLB lookup on every memory operation and the resulting physical address is then sent to the cache.p  pMy question since the CPU deals with virtual addresses, how is this query performedp  pI dont understand CPU encounters a virtual address  CPU contacts TLB which is addressed with physical addresses    TLB spits out another physical addressp  pTLBp  precode Physical Address  Another Physical Address  codepre  pThis totally doesnt make sense to mep  pTaken a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTranslationlookasidebufferOverview relnofollowfrom wikipediaap

Negative 53233 pIve written a routine in C that solves the system of equations Ax  b using GaussSeidel method. However, I want to use this code for specific A matrices that are sparse most of the elements are zero. This way, most of the time that this solver takes is busy multiplying some elements by zero.p  pFor example, for the following system of equationsp  precode 4 1  0  0  0   x1     b1  1  4 1  0  0   x2     b2   0 1  4 1  0   x3    b3   0  0 1  4 1   x4     b4   0  0  0 1  4   x5     b5  codepre  pUsing GaussSeidel method, we will have the following iteration formula for x1p  px1  [b1  1  x2  0  x3  0  x4  0  x5]  4p  pAs you see, the solver is wasting time by multiplying zero elements. Since I work with big matrices for example, 105 by 105, this will influence the total CPU time in a negative way. I wonder if there is a way to optimize the solver so that it omits those part of calculations related to zero element multiplications.p  pNote that the the form of the A matrix in the example above is arbitrary and the solver must be able to work with any A matrix.p  pHere is the codep  precodevoid GaussSeideldouble A, double b, double x, int arraySize     const double tol  0.001  arraySize double error  tol  1  for int i  1 i lt arraySize i     x[i]  0  double xOld xOld  new double [arraySize] for int i  1 i lt arraySize i     xOld[i]  101  while abserror gt tol       for int i  1 i lt arraySize i              sum  0         for int j  1 j lt arraySize j                      if j  i                 continue             sum  sum  A[i][j]  x[j]                  x[i]  1  A[i][i]  b[i]  sum           cout ltlt endl ltlt Answers ltlt endl ltlt endl     error  errorCalcxOld, x, arraySize      for int i  1 i lt arraySize i         xOld[i]  x[i]  cout ltlt Solution converged ltlt endl ltlt endl  codepre

Negative 53233 pI have recently picked up an application I was working on some time ago.p  pNot soon after I already stumbled across a problem with inheritance.p  pI have a base class called ModelBase which has a pure virtual method, making it an abstract class. The class looks like followedp  precodeifndef MODELBASEH define MODELBASEH  include ltQMetaTypegt include ltQStringgt  class ModelBase  public     ModelBase     virtual ModelBase      long getId const     void setIdconst long id      virtual QString toString const  0 private     long mid    QDECLAREMETATYPEModelBase  endif  MODELBASEH codepre  pThe fact that it is declared as a METATYPE is probably something to keep in mind for reading the rest of the code. p  pI derived several classes from this base class. For this example I will use the two that gives me most problems.p  precodeifndef PLATFORMH define PLATFORMH  include ltQDategt  include modelbase.h include game.h  class Platform  ModelBase  public     Platform     Platform      QString toString const      QString getName     QDate getPublishDate      void setNameQString name     void setPublishDateQDate publishDate private     QString mname     QDate mpublishDate     QListltGamegt mgames   endif  PLATFORMH codepre  pAs you can see, the header also includes the virtual method from the parent class ModelBase. p  pLast but not least the problem classp  precodeifndef GAMEH define GAMEH  include ltQDategt  include modelbase.h  class Platform class Publisher class Genre  class Game  ModelBase  public     Game     Game      QString getTitle     Publisher getPublisher     Genre getGenre     Platform getPlatform     QDate getPublishDate     QString getLentTo      void setTitleQString title     void setPublisherPublisher amppublisher     void setGenreGenre ampgenre     void setPlatformPlatform ampplatform     void setPublishDateQDate date     void setLentToQString lentTo      QString toString const private     QString mtitle     Publisher mpublisher     Genre mgenre     Platform mplatform     QDate mpublishDate     QString mlentTo   endif  GAMEH codepre  pNow that the code is in place...p  pThe first problem comes with circular dependency.p  pA platform has many games, a game has one platform.p  pI solved that by forward declaring platform in games.h and including games.h in platforms.hp  pNow that that is out of the way, I compiled my program and get the following complaints which i really dont understand.p  precodexxxxxmingw4732includeQtCoreqmetatype.h382 error cannot allocate an object of abstract type ModelBase codepre  pOk fair enough.. But I am never really directly defining ModelBase in the classes.

Negative 53233 pI will post my code in an edit... Im having trouble submitting my question with the code included. p  pI maintain a chat program which was already built when I was assigned to it. My job started out just themeing it to make it match the rest of our website. Now management is asking for additional features that are over my head. One such feature is an option the customer to save a copy of the chat log to their computer. p  pThe entire chat conversation is stored in a javascript variable called chatHistoryHTML and a loop causes the chat session on the page to update every 5 seconds by adding new lines of text to the chatHistoryHTML variable and displaying it in the history div for the customer to see.p  pRight now, I understand how to open a new window to display strongonlystrong the chat history and none of the logos, backgrounds, or the text input box. However, Im unable to pass PHP commands to that new page using my method. p  pIdeally I would like a solution that would allow the user to click a button and have a save dialog come up that only saves the chat conversation, without opening a new window. Im opening a new window right now because Im trying to avoid saving all the other content on the page. p  pIm open to suggestions. I know a little Javascript and PHP but know nothing about AJAX p

Negative 53233 pI want to make a tokenization subprogram which will work like this p  ul liRead user inputli liFind tokensli liUse a substring function to get each tokenli liStore each token in a structli ul  pThe idea was simple  i think  but I came up with a difficult problem. When making the substring function, I realized that it was a memory leak hole. The only way i can think of making a substring function is this p  precode    char sub   char  malloc   somelength  1   sizeof char        for  i  startindex  i lt somelength  i                sub[ i  startindex ]  sourcestring[i]           sub[ somelength ]  0      return sub codepre  pBut the problem is that when using the substring function, i wont have the ability to free that memory afterwards.p  precode     Example usage      TokenStruct MyToken  CreateToken substring input , start , length   codepre  pSome may suggest that i should free memory inside the CreateToken function but this seems like a VERY bad idea to me because it will make CreateTokens code very dependent on the substring function. Also, the substring function might be used in many other functions.p  pI had an idea of keeping a table of pointers and free them before terminating the program but seems kind of sketchy...p  pWhat do you think guys What is the best way to deal with this kind of problemp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 53233 pLets say that theres an interface specification X. X calls for codeXHeader.hcode to have a struct called codeXFiddlecode that guarantees the presence of members codefoocode and codebarcode, both of type codeintcode. However, implementationdefined members are not prohibited and are in fact encouraged if doing so increases efficiency. I need to write an implementation of X for the company I work for, and realised that having a few members specific to my implementation to store some state would be very convenient, so I wrote the followingp  precodetypedef struct XFiddle      int foo  Guaranteed by spec      int bar  Guaranteed by spec      sizet dinkydingbat  IMPLEMENTATIONSPECIFIC, DO NOT USE      unsigned char dingbatdata  IMPLEMENTATIONSPECIFIC, DO NOT USE   XFiddle codepre  pOf course, theres nothing to tell the users that codedinkydingbatcode or codedingbatdatacode should not be used since they are implementationspecific details and may change or disappear at some point in the future. Given that I cant hide the implementation by using something like opaque pointers, what should I do to make such internal members stand out or other tricks to hide such things Are there any commonly usedstandard ways of dealing with problems like this Best I could think of is using a naming convention like leading underscores, but Im not sure if the leading underscores rules apply to member variables, and I have a feeling that Im getting mixed up with some C specific rules too. I also thought of naming them something like codeINTERNALdinkydingbatcode or having a separate struct for internal types contained inside codeXFiddlecode, but Id like to keep the extra typing to a minimum so I dislike them somewhat. Or is it perfectly acceptable just to have a plain, ordinary struct as above, where implementationspecific details are spelled out in the comments and documentation, leaving the less experienced and diligent to suffer their selfinflicted wounds when I need to change things aroundp  pAssuming Im starting from scratch andor my companyteam has no convention for this specific case.p

But the next time the central scans same device, it gets instead the GATT value of iPad because my central and peripheral are on two iPad minis.p  pApple Doc. says it normally sends the GATT, but I observe that it always sends the 28char name once.p  pBACKGROUND I want to put identification data in the peripherals ad data, to avoid a readvalue interchange.  The reason is to have the shortest communication interchange between devices, to save time and battery.p  pIve tried turning scanning off then back on, and stopping and restarting advertising.  Same problem.p

Negative 53233 pI am writing a script that takes two strings of the format HHMM as inputs.  These strings are times in hours HH and minutes MM.  I would like to display an error message if the user inputs the wrong format for a time, such as HHMMSS if they think the script can interpret seconds as well. I have it set up to accept negative times, so an input like HHMM will be interpreted correctly. An input like HHHMMM with variable hour and minute sizes is also OK, actually any input of the form ss should be accepted since errors like 530 AM are dealt with later.p  pWhat I need is to test that the inputs are of the form string colon string before reading, is this possible  To make the problem clearer, here is code explaining how I read the inputs time1 and time2p  precode[hour1, min1]  strreadtime1, ss, delimiter,  [hour2, min2]  strreadtime2, ss, delimiter,  codepre  pIf time1 and time2 are formatted wrong, strread throws an unhelpful error.

Negative 53233 pIm writing some lockfree code, and I came up with an interesting pattern, but Im not sure if it will behave as expected under relaxed memory ordering.p  pThe simplest way to explain it is using an examplep  precodestdatomicltintgt a, b, c  auto alocal  a.loadstdmemoryorderrelaxed auto blocal  b.loadstdmemoryorderrelaxed if alocal lt blocal      auto clocal  c.fetchadd1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed  codepre  pNote that all operations use codestdmemoryorderrelaxedcode.p  pObviously, on the thread that this is executed on, the loads for codeacode and codebcode must be done before the codeifcode condition is evaluated.p  pSimilarly, the readmodifywrite RMW operation on codeccode must be done after the condition is evaluated because its conditional on that... condition.p  pWhat I want to know is, does this code guarantee that the value of codeclocalcode is at least as uptodate as the values of codealocalcode and codeblocalcode If so, how is this possible given the relaxed memory ordering Is the control dependency together with the RWM operation acting as some sort of acquire fence Note that theres not even a corresponding release anywhere.p  pIf the above holds true, I believe this example should also work assuming no overflow  am I rightp  precodestdatomicltintgt a0, b0   Thread 1 while true      auto alocal  a.fetchadd1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed     if alocal gt 0      Always true at runtime         b.fetchadd1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed         Thread 2 auto blocal  b.loadstdmemoryorderrelaxed if blocal lt 777       Note that fetchadd returns the preincrementation value     auto alocal  a.fetchadd1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed     assertblocal lt alocal     Is this guaranteed  codepre  pOn thread 1, there is a control dependency which I suspect guarantees that codeacode is always incremented before codebcode is incremented but they each keep being incremented neckandneck. On thread 2, there is another control dependency which I suspect guarantees that codebcode is loaded into codeblocalcode before codeacode is incremented. I also think that the value returned from codefetchaddcode will be at least as recent as any observed value in codeblocalcode, and the codeassertcode should therefore hold. But Im not sure, since this departs significantly from the usual memoryordering examples, and my understanding of the C11 memory model is not perfect I have trouble reasoning about these memory ordering effects with any degree of certainty. Any insights would be appreciatedp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong As bames53 has helpfully pointed out in the comments, given a sufficiently smart compiler, its possible that an codeifcode could be optimised out entirely under the right circumstances, in which case the relaxed loads could be reordered to occur after the RMW, causing their values to be more uptodate than the codefetchaddcode return value the codeassertcode could fire in my second example. However, what if instead of an codeifcode, an codeatomicsignalfencecode not codeatomicthreadfencecode is inserted That certainly cant be ignored by the compiler no matter what optimizations are done, but does it ensure that the code behaves as expected Is the CPU allowed to do any reordering in such a casep  pThe second example then becomesp  precodestdatomicltintgt a0, b0   Thread 1 while true      auto alocal  a.fetchadd1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed     stdatomicsignalfencestdmemoryorderacqrel     b.fetchadd1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed    Thread 2 auto blocal  b.loadstdmemoryorderrelaxed stdatomicsignalfencestdmemoryorderacqrel  Note that fetchadd returns the preincrementation value auto alocal  a.fetchadd1, stdmemoryorderrelaxed assertblocal lt alocal     Is this guaranteed codepre  hr  pstrongAnother updatestrong After reading all the responses so far and combing through the standard myself, I dont think it can be shown that the code is correct using only the standard.

Negative 53233 pI have a Marionette Module with several Sub Modules. The parent Module has its own event aggregator that I would like to use in the sub modules to trigger events. I know that I could use the Applications event aggregator, but these events are specific to the Parent Module and its Children, and not the whole Application. p  pI could namespace the events in the Applications event aggregator like sop  precodeApp.moduleParent.Child, functionself, App, ...      somewhere in the child   App.vent.triggerParentsomething  codepre  pBut Id really rather not go that route. I think the idea of having a single event aggregator for Parent Module and its children is cleaner. I like having a single interface from the Parent to the Application, and the Child to the Parent ... but perhaps Im wrong in this thinkingp  pI could also get to the Parent Modules event aggregator from the App object like sop  precodeApp.moduleParent.Child, functionself, App, ...      somewhere in the child...   App.Parent.vent.triggersomething  codepre  pBut Id rather not do that either. I think that would couple the Child module and the App too tightly.p  pAny other ideas or options Maybe these are good ideas, and I just dont understand the benefits.p
Negative 53233 pI have an embedded application that I am working on. To protect the data on this image its partitions are mounted RO this helps prevent flash errors when the power is lost unexpectedly since I cannot guarantee clean shutdowns, you could pull the plugp  pAn application I am working that needs to be protected resides on this RO partition, however this program also needs to be able to change configuration files on the same RO file system. I have code that allows me to remount this partition RW as needed eg for firmware updates, but this requires all the processes to be stopped that are running from the read only partition ie killall myapplication. Hence it is not possible for my application to remount the partition it needs to modify without first killing itself I am not sure which one is the chicken and which one is the egg, but you get the gist.p  pIs there a way to start my application in such a way that the entire binary is kept in RAM and there is no link back to the partition from which it was run so that the unmount reports the partition as busyp  pOr alternatively is there a way to safely remount this RO partition without first killing the process running on itp

Negative 53233 pEDITp  pNO LONGER RELEVANT.  Due to difficulties with Installshield including not only this issue but also issues with getting it to build with the project in Visual Studio and its inability to replace one of the old files that needs to be replaced I am now coding an installer in C.  I should have done this earlier because Id be done by now.  Thank you Christopher Painter and Michael Urman for trying to guide me though this issue.  Unfortunately I did not get anywhere further with it.p  pORIGINAL POST BELOWp  pHonestly, this has been like pulling teeth.  I hope that Im missing something blatantly obvious.  I have been trying to get Installshield to let me set the INSTALLDIR to an environmental variable.  This is necessary because of the way the company does things.  I know I can set it outside of the installer via a batch file which calls the MSI and passes the folder via an argument, but that solution ended up with an unfriendly MSI.  If anyone has any internal solutions please let me know.p

Negative 53233 pA client is reporting an issue whereby she is copying from an email into a screen in a program we have created with Delphi 5. The component on this screen to which she is copying is a TMemo component.p  pWhen a line of text contains an ellipsis ... character or closing quotation marks character , the text is replaced with a vertical bar. If the text has two periods in a row, the periods appear correctly. When using the single quotation mark , the text appears correctly.p  pIn testing this, I was able to replicate this issue from within an Outlook client and Word document.  The error does not occur when copying text from within Notepad.  The error also does not occur if I create the text from within the TMemo component, copy it into Outlook or Word, then copy it back into the component.p

Negative 53233 pI was trying to determine the time complexity of doing codenumpy.zeroscode so I ran the following tests.

Negative 53233 pThe traditional way to host multiple websites on a single IP was to use a shared host and use an Apache virtualhost config for each site.

Negative 53233 pAs far as I know, there are three reasons why a stdbadalloc can be thrownp  ol liThe process requests more memory than what can be servedli liThe address space is too fragmented to serve a request for a large chunk of contiguous memoryli liThe heap management datastructure is corruptedli ol  pWe have code which runs into a stdbadalloc, but none of the above reasons seem to apply. The datastructure is a graph stored as a stdlist of vertices, where each vertex stores again a stdlist of the edges of which it is part of as well as some amount of contiguous data. p  pFor small graphs lt 100000 vertices, the program runs perfectly fine, irrespective of how large the data sections per vertex are we can without problems allocate up to 40 GB in total. If the number of vertices grows larger, however, we get a stdbadalloc exception thrown even on instances using only 8 GB of memory.p  pSince there are no problems when allocating more memory in larger blocks, above reasons 1. and 2. should be ruled out. There are sections where we play around with pointers in a quite error prone way, so it is possible that we might corrupt the heap datastructure. But when run on smaller instances, valgrinds memcheck reports our code as flawless, so that reason seems unlikely as well on throwing instances, valgrind itself runs out of memory, so we cannot check that case directly. p  pAre there any ideas on what else could be the reason for this behaviour, or what tests we might run to further pin down the problemp  pOS Fedora 19br Build system cmake with gcc 4.8.2p

Negative 53233 pIm currently working on something in javascript but im having the following issue. I got this functionp  precodekjdocument.readyfunction     kj.bxslider.bxSlider         minSlides 3,         maxSlides 4,         slideWidth 170,         slideMargin 10,       codepre  pSo if my document is loaded he is calling the bxSlider which has its own javascript file. But in this javascript file there is the following function getting calledp  precodesetup codepre  pWhat this does is the following not copying all the code only the relevant piecep  precodevar setup  function          wrap el in a wrapper         el.wrapltdiv classbxwrappergtltdiv classbxviewportgtltdivgtltdivgt          store a namspace reference to .bxviewport         slider.viewport  el.parent          add a loading div to display while images are loading         slider.loader  ltdiv classbxloading gt         slider.viewport.prependslider.loader          set el to a massive width, to hold any needed slides          also strip any margin and padding from el [...... more code]  codepre  pAs you can see this piece of code is creating DOM elements. So if i refresh or enter the page he keeps creating the bxwrapper and bxviewport and its getting stuck in a never ending loop. It is probably because of the document.ready function. This function still thinks the page isnt loaded yet because my other javascript is creating DOM elements. If I do a hard refresh on the page I dont get this problem. So kinda weird tho. Anyone that has an solution for thisp  pThanks in advance.p  pGreets, p  pWouterp

Negative 53233 pIm doing some practice questions to learn how to program in C... Its essentially a guessing game program. Have the program initially guess 50, and have it ask the user whether the guess is high, low, or correct. If, say, the guess is low, have the next guess be halfway between 50 and 100, that is, 75. If that guess is high, let the next guess be halfway between 75 and 50, and so on. Were assuming that the user wont cheat.  Im rusty so I cant remember what operators I should use to increment the programs response based on the users input. Itd be 2x the number, or half the number based on a response of H or L.

Negative 53233 pSo, this may sound confusing, but Im writing a prime factorization method, and Im trying to find out how many times a certain number appears in a vector. To do that, I made a set that holds the unique values so I know which numbershow many numbers to count in the vector, but Im having trouble putting it together. p  pI know that I can count through the vector using an iterator, but I dont know how to say, hey, check for the number at position one in the set. I looked through resources, but they only use find, and Im assuming that I dont know what the numbers in the codevectorltintgtcode are, or where the index is where the number changes if it does.p  pI figured I could iterate through the set, but doing that gives me the counts for all of the numbers, which Im storing in another vector. I mean, I suppose I could just divide the count vector in half, but thats kind of jerryrigging it, and Id rather just code it right the first time than have to come up with tricks to get the results I want, because I did the latter in a previous method I wrote and it only worked sometimes.p

I assume these requests can not route back through the public IP of the load balancer p  pI get the impression the solution to this is to route all requests from instances though a 3rd instance running squid. Is this the best way to do this side questionp  pNow to my main questionp  pI have been reading about ApiAxle which sounds like a nice proxy for Web Services, giving some good access control, throttling and reporting capabilities.p  pCan I have an instance running ApiAxle followed by a google cloud Load Balancer which shares the request from the proxy to the backend instances that do the leg work and feed the response back through the ApiAxle proxy, thus having everything though a single IP visible to clients using the API letting me add new instances to the pool to add capacity.p  pand Would the proxy be much of a bottle neck p  pThanks in advance.p  pDave p  pnew to this, so sorry if its a stupid question because I cant find anything like this on the webp
Negative 53233 pI am doing a scrolling text animation with VS2010 and Windows 7. I have a textbox, label and a button, of course a timer to make this work. following is the code I put in timer.p  precodePrivate Sub Button1Clicksender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs Handles Button1.Click     Label1.Text  TextBox1.Text     Timer1.Interval  1000     Timer1.Start  End Sub  Private Sub Timer1Ticksender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs Handles Timer1.Tick     Dim txtBuffer As String  TextBox1.Text     Label1.Text  Label1.Text     If LenLabel1.Text ltgt 0 Then         Label1.Text  Microsoft.VisualBasic.RightLabel1.Text, LenLabel1.Text  1     Else         Timer1.Enabled  False     End If End Sub codepre  pMy problem is when you input a certain amount of space at the start of string, the scrolling animation is kind of strange. It will not showing the string moving from right side into the label, but only show the whole string at once then start scrolling out of the left boundary of the label. p  pI am using fixed length of label, my purpose is to simulate a message board, so the text can be scrolled into the msg box from right side and moving out from left. p  pI debuged each time the timer was triggered and the head of string which is a certain amount of spaces does go away one by one. But I didnt see the expected animation on the label. p  pThe size of label is 7 upper case letters width and AutoSize property is false. If in the textbox you input is [7 space] ABCDEFG, then you would expect the scrolling effect would be [7 space][6 space]A[5 space]AB [4 space]ABC...ABCDEFGBCDEFGCDEFG.... But you wont get it. All you will get is [7 space] for a while, then all of a sudden, ABCDEFG appears, then the letters go away one by one. The string is not looks like it slides in from the right side of label area.p  pI dont know if anyone can help on that or maybe have a better idea to realize that animation Thanksp

The first codedivcode, emfadeem, will be used to cover the entire page with a semitransparent black background, essentially giving the effect of the page fading away, while also making things modal.p  pI wanted to be able to nest the image inside the emfadeem codedivcode, but I ran into a problem. Setting the opacity on the outer div to create the fade effect caused my nested image to inherit the opacity value.

I did build the php from sources on 6.5, so maybe Im missing a library  Php otherwise works fine.p  pI have no idea how to troubleshoot this, as PHP decides not to load this library and then keeps running.    gdb doesnt even catch it.p  pHere is the exact errorp  precodePHP Warning  PHP Startup Unable to load dynamic library usrlocalphp54libphpextensionsnodebugnonzts20100525myextension.so  usrlocalphp54libphpextensionsnodebugnonzts20100525myextension.so    undefined symbol ZNKSt13runtimeerror4whatEv in Unknown on line 0 codepre  pstrongeditstrong If I link my extension to a simple executable with a main and call some of the C methods I have, it works fine.   p  pldd is showing a dependency on libstdc.so in my test executable, but not in my shared library myextension.so.

Negative 53233 pI developed my codeAppWidgetcode according to the android doc, loading my cursor in codeonCreatecode and reloading it in codeonDataSetChangedcode, and everything worked fine, until I set some breakpoints in my a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetRemoteViewsService.RemoteViewsFactory.html relnofollowcodeRemoteViewsService.RemoteViewsFactorycodea and surprisingly found that codeonDataSetChangedcode is emalwaysem called after the call to codeonCreatecode, which made my cursor loaded twice when first created. Im on Android 4.4.3.p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetRemoteViewsService.RemoteViewsFactory.htmlonDataSetChanged2829 relnofollowApi doca,p  blockquote   ppublic abstract void onDataSetChanged p      pAdded in API level 11p      pCalled when notifyDataSetChanged is triggered on the remote adapter. This allows a RemoteViewsFactory to respond to data changes by updating any internal references. Note expensive tasks can be safely performed synchronously within this method. In the interim, the old data will be displayed within the widget.p blockquote  pSeems that this call is only triggered by manually calling notifyDataSetChanged ourselves.p  pHowever acccording to the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsappwidgetsindex.html relnofollowAppwidget guidea, p  blockquote   pIn onCreate you setup any connections  cursors to your data source. Heavy lifting,   for example downloading or creating content etc, should be deferred to onDataSetChanged   or getViewAt. Taking more than 20 seconds in this call will result in an ANR.p blockquote  pBy saying emdeferredem, is it implying that codeonDataSetChangedcode will be called after codeonCreatecode Im not so sure... However it does say I should setup my cursor inside codeonCreatecode.p  pI tried to investigate this issue myself, however the available source code is using codeBindercode so the remote caller remains unknown, thus I cannot inspect its source.p  pDo you have any ideap

However, it doesnt work for codeItemsSourcecode property of codeltoxyLineSeriesgtcode. Its DataContext is still the same as codeMyControlcodes strongparentstrong i.e. Page, not the same as codeRootGridcode. I have wasted a lot of time on this and found out that I have to add codeDataContextBindingcode to codeltoxyPlotgtcode. Why is that Why one element seems to inherit its parent codeDataContextcode while the other doesnt Is it because codeltoxyLineSeriesgtcode is child of codeltoxyPlotgtcode, not codeRootGridcodep

Negative 53233 pIm developing an installed application that accesses the googleapi via OAuth2. There some security problems I currently know no real solution for. Doesnt matter how hard I obfuscate my clientsecret a determined person can retrieve and use it. Two problems arise from thisp  ol lipsomebody uses my client secret to modify user data p  pso far it seems that an installed application needs to be authorized again when no refresh token is used. However Im not sure if this is part of the client api I use or if it is ensured on server side. If it is ensured on server side Im happy with it pli lipsomebody uses my client secret to exceed my accesslimitp  pOk this is googlespecific. As long as I dont pay I have a free quota and it can be exhausted. So somebody can use my client secret to exhaust the quota and no other client will be able to access its data  I cannot think of a real solution for this besides never ever upgrading the service to paid level.pli ol  pThe only secure solution that comes to my mind would be to have a webserver as gateway that interacts with google and transfers the access token to the client. Or maybe it even keeps the tokens and just transfers the requested dataafter user authentification openid...whateverp  pAs conclusion I dont have a webserver I could use as gateway.  Therefore as long as the user data is secured no one can access it with a stolen clientsecret without the user granting access for new tokens I can go ahead with the free quota limit and see how fast it is exceeded  and never upgrade it.p  pI would be glad for any comments on this topic.

Negative 53233 pI am trying to design and implement a framework to communicate with server its an iOS framework written in Swift. The challenge I am facing is the architecture  there are two ways of communicating with the server and I have to implement both different versions. I really want to achieve having a stateless client, with methods such as codeClient.authenticatecode or codeClient.downloadFilecode. The problem is when having two implementations I would end up with methods in my Client class like this onep  precodepublic class func authenticatestate state      if state.type  1          Client1.authenticatestate      else          Client2.authenticatestate       codepre  pRepeated for every single method...p  pI wanted to initially keep the client like this  stateless and static and have only state objects that hold the actual state as there could be many connections to the server with various states. By that I wanted to avoid having the client as an object and both holding the state and performing the calls to the server. The problem is that this approach is just...dirty I guess. What would be a more DRY, readable and sustainable way of doing thisp

Negative 53233 pI feel like Im very close to a solution... Im getting no errors or crashes, but my text file from my SD card is simply not showing. p  pIntention I am trying to read ALL files from a particular directory in my Documents directory on my SD card, then once each file is read, it should be loaded into my codeListViewcode via my adapter. I have a model set up codePoemListItem.javacode, that should retrieve the title of the file, and the contents of the file, both in codeStringscode. I know that it reaches the file in the directory, because when I take away the codefor loopcode that adds default text in case there are not many files in the directory into the codeArrayListltgtcode, then the number of lines in the list are exactly equal to the number of files in the directory. So that part works at least. Only problem is there is nothing showing. Whyp  pThanks for your helpp  pHere you can see that one list item displays since there is one file in the SD card directory of choice, but that title and text are hint code from the xml, not the actual file title and contents. I assume the hint text is overridden when you import file contents instead It doesnt seem to be here... The actual title and text that are supposed to be there instead is simply File name and Test 2... instead of Title and Quote or poem, here.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJRUWs.png altenter image

Is the following the best way to set up Excel for this p  pIn Excel have one row for each contact and several columns for the different type codes i.e. each row will have 10 columns available for type codes.  In Access create a Union Query that will take all the type codes in each row and make a Junction table with one or more records for each contact, each record consisting of contact and type.p  pIs there a better way to set up Excel for this data entry It seems awkward although Ive done it before and it works.p

Negative 53233 pHello I am currently trying to insert data that I get from an XML file into my MySql database. I am using Sails.js and waterline for the queries. My tables are Users and Pets, a user can have multiple pets and a pet can have multiple users owners, so my join table is userspets.p  pI transform the XML file into a javascript object and loop though it to insert data. My problem is that I need the loop to be async because I dont want duplicates record in the pets table. For each iteration, I am checking if the pet exists, if it doesnt Im creating it, else I am taking its ID and inserting it to the user being inserted. If this is not async, multiple findOrCreate trigger at the same time and duplicates of pets are created in the database.p  pHow can I optimize this code For a 125 user xml and their pets it takes about 85 seconds wich is huge.p  pXMLp  precodeltusersgt   ltusergt     ltpetsgt       ltpetgt       ltpetgt     ltpetsgt   ltusergt   ... ltusersgt codepre  pCodep  precodeasync.eachSeriesusers, functionuser, callback    var pets  []   async.eachSeriesuser.pets, functionpet, callback     pets.findOrCreatename pet.name.execfunction err,userPet        pets.pushuserPet.id       callback        , functionerr     users.createname user.name, pets pets     .execfunctionerr, created        callback         , functionerr   ...  codepre

Negative 53233 pIm building a Wordpress website by customizing and editing an existing theme called onetone. Its an onepager theme.

When Im visiting as an unlogged, regular user the line is there. All major browsers FF, Opera, IE, Chrome. Also, on my sisters computer with FF installed the line didnt show even when unlogged.p  pIve searched StackOverflow, and the usual answer to have codeltbodygtcode and codelthtmlgtcode set to codeheight100code including codeminheight100code isnt working. Ive also added heightminheight to containers and wrappers to test the setting. Not all, though, only the ones I thought were relevant to the issue I was trying to solve Ive also tried the codemargin 0code amp codepadding 0code, but NOTHING works.p  pI suspected its the footers fault, but using the eminspect elementem function in my browser and some further tests I found the footer has nothing to do with it.p  pIn the original, untouched theme, the line doesnt appear. So it must be some of my edits causing it, though even by comparing the original and my edited CSS file line by line, I couldnt find something that shouldve caused this error. And the CSS is the only thing Ive edited.p  pIm not a coding expert, and Ive about exhausted my wits and available knowledge trying to figure this out.

Negative 53233 pIm new to the Spring Framework, and as a symptom, I want to keep my adoption of its Web MVC portions as simple as possible, so Im using the annotation functions to work with Spring. In the past, Ive used br codeint value  Integer.valueOfrequest.getParameternumberValuecode brto pull values from parameters  explicitly converting the String returned by codegetParametercode.br Helpfully, Ive noticed that when I use Springs  terminologybrcodeRequestParameternumberValue int numValcodebr the conversion is handled automatically. This is nice, but a black box to me. I tried looking at questions on here or in the Spring documentation, but all that information deals with custom conversions like Converter for objects or formatting issues. All I want to know is how Spring handles primitive type conversions for codeRequestParamcode by default.p

Negative 53233 pIn a Swift implementation of a codeUIViewControllercode, we have the opportunity to use default property values instead of having to conduct the codeUIViewControllercode initializer ceremony. For examplep  precodeclass ViewController UIViewController       let model  SomeModelObject codepre  pWhat are the impacts of this approach, rather than instantiating the model property in, say, codeviewDidLoadcode Examplep  precodeclass ViewController UIViewController       var model SomeModelObject      override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad         model  SomeModelObject codepre  pIf the object being assigned to the property is always instantiated in a known manner, wouldnt just setting a default property value make more sense rather than making it an optional and assigning it a value within codeviewDidLoadcode In an oC implementation, wed typically implement an codeinitcode, and use the codeif [super init]code idiom to conditionally initialize the controller properties. However, it seems that most of the sample code from Apple, at the time of this writing, doesnt follow this idiom in Swift with default property values.p

Negative 53233 pI am reading data from large CSV files, processing it, and loading it into a SQLite database. Profiling suggests 80 of my time is spent on IO and 20 is processing input to prepare it for DB insertion.  I sped up the processing step with codemultiprocessing.Poolcode so that the IO code is never waiting for the next record. But, this caused serious memory problems because the IO step could not keep up with the workers.p  pThe following toy example illustrates my problemp  precodeusrbinenv python   3.4.3 import time from multiprocessing import Pool  def recordsnum100     Simulate generator getting data from large CSV files.     for i in rangenum         printReading record 0.formati         time.sleep0.05   getting raw data is fast         yield i  def processrec     Simulate processing of raw text into dicts.     printProcessing 0.formatrec     time.sleep0.1   processing takes a little time     return rec  def writerrecords     Simulate saving data to SQLite database.     for r in records         time.sleep0.3   writing takes the longest         printWrote 0.formatr  if name  main     data  records100     with Pool2 as pool         writerpool.imapunorderedprocess, data, chunksize5 codepre  pThis code results in a backlog of records that eventually consumes all memory because I cannot persist the data to disk fast enough. Run the code and youll notice that codePool.imapunorderedcode will consume all the data when codewritercode is at the 15th record or so.  Now imagine the processing step is producing dictionaries from hundreds of millions of rows and you can see why I run out of memory. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAmdahl27slaw relnofollowAmdahls Lawa in action perhaps.p  pWhat is the fix for this I think I need some sort of buffer for codePool.imapunorderedcode that says once there are emxem records that need insertion, stop and wait until there are less than emxem before making more.  I should be able to get some speed improvement from preparing the next record while the last one is being saved.p  pI tried using a hrefhttpmcieslikmctp.github.iopapyapi.htmlhighlightnumapmodulenumap.NuMap relnofollowcodeNuMapcodea from the codepapycode module which I modified to work with Python 3 to do exactly this, but it wasnt faster. In fact, it was worse than running the program sequentially codeNuMapcode uses two threads plus multiple processes.p  pBulk import features of SQLite are probably not suited to my task because the data need substantial processing and normalization.p  pI have about 85G of compressed text to process. Im open to other database technologies, but picked SQLite for ease of use and because this is a writeonce readmany job in which only 3 or 4 people will use the resulting database after everything is loaded.p

Negative 53233 pI have developed a project that is quite big, I was thinking in improving security by saving a token in Session variable and sending that token in each form to check if it is correct to prevent from CSRF attacks.p  pThe thing is that the project has many forms and it could be painful and take a lot of time to go through each form in order to add the token in a hidden input.p  pSo I was asking myself, is there any easy way to add that hidden value to each form without having to go through each form Maybe using jquery, I could localize each form inside the page to add a hidden input, then add a general POSTGET function to check for any request if token is correct.p  pThis is an idea, but probably there may be another simple and better way. Is there any simple, fast and decent way to do so What would be the best approach in this situation preparing CSRF attack prevention after project has been developed. As far as I know the best way to prevent from CSR attacks is using token variables, is there maybe another decent way to do so without having to use a token and go through each formp

Negative 53233 pI have a MVC project with forms authentication.p  pBasically it works fine The user wants to access a controller with codeAuthorizeAttributecode and gets redirected to loginpage if not authenticated. On redirect the parameter codereturnUrlcode gets forwarded as well.p  pHowever, in case the first try of the login fails, the return to the page does not work anymore. I think the codereturnUrlcode gets changed to the account controller after the first try because it case the last page before the current login try. So authentication still seems to work but the user stays on the login page and doesnt get redirected to the page he was before.p  pIs there a way to prevent codereturnUrlcode from being changed after the first failed loginp

Negative 53233 pAfter already having parsed my data through swiftyjson I am looking to display the parsed information in a uitableview. Lets say I have a list of names that I parsed out of the json file. I would like those names to display each in their own respective cells to allow the user to view them all.p  pI would also assume that if they selected the selected cells which are being displayed strings now after being parsed that I can actually have those stored into a core data object storing them as returnable strings The thing is I used the .append function onto an array that I created well call codenames  [String]code to actually allow the values to actually come in order for the cells. p  pBut when doing this I noticed a huge spike in cpu usage doing this as it keeps appending them in order lets say first name is matt second name is john and so forth then it creates a new situation of the array every time. so the first time it reads just matt then the next println would print out matt, john then the next one prints out matt, john, tom and so forth until the list of json names is completed. p  pIf I have 500 names or more it takes the cpu awhile to process all those names into the array. I know there has to be another way but all references I see all use the .append method. So my code would be     names.appendName. Name is a parsed string from swiftyjson. From there I am actually able to populate the tableview which is fine it displays correctly in the end but it takes the device awhile to populate as it first needs to process adding all 500 names each time the parse is called.

After banging my head against the wall for the last 24 hours I decided to rewatch a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comvideoswwdc2014501 relnofollowWWDC session 501a see 5417.

The music that Im playing is only 2 minutes long. Apparently, this is too long to just read into the buffer outright. Is the buffer being overwritten every time the codereadIntoBuffercode method is called inside the loop Im such a noob at this stuff...how can I get the entire file playedp  pIf I cant get this to work, what is a good way to play music 2 different files across multiple codeSKScenecodesp

If the user moves the mouse or presses some keys I close the WaitForm like thisp  precodeSplashScreenManager.CloseForm codepre  pstrongHeres the problem explained in stepsstrongp  ol liMouse cursor is on the form.li liUser doesnt do anything for some time  idle time  so I show the codeWaitFormcode.li liNow I get a codeMouseMove messagecode in my codePreFilterMessagecode method BUT WHY Mouse didnt move.
