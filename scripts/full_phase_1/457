Positive 457 pWhat does public key for a .net assembly means exactlyp  pMost of the time people talks about PublicKeyToken Which is just reference or shortcut key to refer the public key but nobody talks about public key. Please tell us what is exactly the public key means What is the purpose of it And most importantly the difference between public key and strong name In GAC, why its not needed to create a strong name for an assembly if a public keyI am assuming it but still did not know is there.p

Positive 457 pAssembly A is dynamically generated using reflection, from code located in assembly B which was compiled with Visual Studio. Assembly A is saved as a DLL. Assembly A uses methods from Assembly B.p  pIn Assembly C, I reference both assemblies A and B, but code in A gives errors at runtime about not finding types and methods from B. Assembly C is generated with the CSharp code provider.p  pI think the solution would be to somehow force Assembly A to load a reference to Assembly B from file before calling any methods or fields from Assembly B, but how to I do that in IL via Reflection.Emitp
Positive 457 pI recently finished a project of mine and want to give it to a friend, but he cant run it due to missing dlls.p  pI then adjusted my project according to some guides on SO, I adjusted my build process to Embedded Ressources and so on, but it just wont work. Also, I added my 2 dlls as Ressources in my project properties.p  pHowever, when I manually give him the 2 dlls I use and he pastes them into the folder containing the .exe, it will run as expected.p  pI should also note that the .exe actually seems to contain the dlls, as the .exe without dlls is just like 20KB big, while the size after my changes is pretty much the sum of the 20KB plus the size of my dlls.p  pWhat could be going wrong herep

I am still new to both p4api.net emandem having to deal with this sort of dependency, but my understanding is that if I can build p4api.net.dll as Any CPU the warning would go away, and I would just need to do some magic to make sure the correct p4bridge.dll was used depending on the CurrentPlatform I defined in the project.p  pI downloaded and compiled the p4api.net source and tried specifying any CPU, but it didnt work. Now it says that the architecture is set for x86 and I still get a similar MSB3270 error  now for x86.  I dont get a warning like this with the p4api.net solution, however, so it doesnt emappearem to have any platform dependencies that I am aware of.

TDMGCC gfortran is perhaps the closest I got, as I could run a DLL created from gfortran, but not in C. In fact, in TDMGCC gfortran, after I created a Fortran DLL that was referencing a C DLL, all function calls to the Fortran generated DLL within Excel VBA would immediately return 0, even after no warnings were given after compiling the Fortran DLL In other cases, it said it could not find the function name in the DLL, even though I made them without decorations or underscores. Excluding the C DLL from that build would eliminate that problem, but of course, I need to reference the C DLL as it has required 3rd party functions.p  pI looked at other posts and could not find an answer to this questionp  ul lipMy question is not a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22134259fortrandllimportimporting a Fortran DLL into c or Capli lipI do not get the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10381739runfortrandllwithvisualstudioAdd as Link option when right clicking AddExisting Itemapli lipThe answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1237129howtocallcsharpcodefromfortrandllthis posta did not solve my questionpli lipA similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23433508fortrancallingacdllwhichinturncallsanotherfortrandllherea was not answered adequatelypli ul  pPlease provide a stepbystep guide to getting Fortran to work with DLLIMPORT, with both gfortran and Intel Visual Studio Fortran, if possible.

Not only to improve my gameplay experience but as a great opportunity to learn something new.p  pDoes anyone have any advice on how to go about starting outp  pIs there an IDE one can use  How does one go about testing  Are there any ready made libraries available  Or would I get a better learning experience by ignoring the libraries and building from scratch How do I oneshot Hoggerp  pWould love to hear your advice, experiences and views.p
Negative 457 pI have a Delphi 7 application that has two views of a document e.g. a WYSIWYG HTML edit might have a WYSIWYG view and a source view  not my real application. They can be opened in separate windows, or docked into tabs in the main window.p  pIf I open a modal dialog from one of the separate forms, the main form is brought to the front, and is shown as the selected window in the windows taskbar. Say the main form is the WYSIWYG view, and the source view is poped out. You go to a particular point in the source view and insert an image tag. A dialog appears to allow you to select and enter the properties you want for the image. If the WYSIWYG view and the source view overlap, the WYSIWYG view will be brought to the front and the source view is hidden. Once the dialog is dismissed, the source view comes back into sight.p  pIve tried setting the owner and the ParentWindow properties to the form it is related top  blockquotecodedialog  TDialogForm.Create parentForm br   dialog.ParentWindow  parentForm.Handle codeblockquote  pHow can I fix this problem What else should I be tryingp  pGiven that people seem to be stumbling on my example, perhaps I can try with a better example a text editor that allows you to have more than one file open at the same time. The files you have open are either in tabs like in the Delphi IDE or in its own window. Suppose the user brings up the spell check dialog or the find dialog. What happens, is that if the file is being editing in its own window, that window is sent to below the main form in the zorder when the modal dialog is shown once the dialog is closed, it is returned to its original zorder.p  pbNoteb If you are using Delphi 7 and looking for a solution to this problem, see my answer lower down on the page to see what I ended up doing.p

Negative 457 pThe question should be interpreted from a general point of view and not targeted solely at web apps or desktop apps.p  pI have been looking around to find a simple and easy way of creating interactive prototypes for web applications. Id like to use a technique that allows simple UI creation and especially UI recreation and modification in further iterations. Filling the UI with mockup data should be very simple. The technique may require a simple form of programming, e.g. to specify a drag and drop behaviour from UI element A to UI element B.p  pOne tool i currently use is the Adobe Flex Builder. The included GUIdesigner is very good and i have accomplished some skills with AS3 so far. The problem is adding data to the UI. It always results in me programming code for checking and parsing of XMLtrees structures, and mainly debugging this section of the prototype. Too cumbersomep  pAnother tool many people use is PowerPoint which involves a really cumbersome way of creating a GUI by drawing every part of an interaction in a separate slide. No way I would be much faster with paper prototypes. Other better free form drawing tools are also part of this category im a happy heavy weight inkscape user but Prototyping and Mockup are obviously not their main purpose. The UIstencil palette for Viso makes it a bit better than the drawing competition.p  pThe main competitors in rapid prototyping as far i know arep  ul liiRiseli liAxureli liSerena and other li liVisoli liPowerpoint, Illustrator, Inkscape or any other free form drawing toolli lipaper prototypingli liIDE with good GUI builders such as Flex Builder Designer and Netbeans Matisseli ul  pMy opinion is that real GUIbuilders are a good staring point. What are your current approaches Please outline your process and the pros and cons as an answer here.p

I then need to change specific parts of those snippets, such as dates, phrases, user information, ampc. There are also, obviously, some bits that I will generate in my program.p  pCurrently, this same task is done sort of by some hideous legacy VBA. Nested IFs and FORs, and over 200 textboxes all called TextBox It gets the job done SOMETIMES, and does so by sending instructions to the Word application codeSelection.MoveDown UnitwdLine, Count1code, for example. Consequently, generating even a simple letter takes 30 seconds, and locks up Office.p  pIm perfectly able to do the same thing with ranges and bookmarks and improved logic, but my gut feeling is that this should be easy to do this with XML and that doing so will have advantages in the future, as these reportsletters are to be accessed, and likely read programmatically, many times by many different users and applications.p  pI have been reading about XML and the WordML schema, but feel like Im missing something.p  pWhat I want the code to do on Submit is thisp  ol liGrab predefined xml snippets header, footer, etc.li liGenerate new strings and concatenate predefined XML stringsli liSave as XMLli liChange value of existing tags in XML file date, username, etcli ol  pI can do this.p  pThe issues I have arep  ul lipI been having trouble getting my head around schema and namespaces.

Copying a dumped table to another server via FTP  SCP or something like that might be quick, but in my eyes it is also very quick and dirty, and Id love to have a nicer solution.p  pCan anyone describe shortly how you would do this the bestpractise wayp  pThis doesnt necessarily have to involve Databases. Dumping the table on Server1 and transferring the raw data in a structured way so server2 can process it without parsing too much is just as good. One requirement though As soon as the data arrives on server2, I want it to be processed, so there has to be a notification of some sort when the transfer is done. Of course I could just write my whole own server sitting on a socket on the second machine and accepting the file with own code and processing it and so forth, but this is just a very very small piece of a very big system, so I dont want to spend half a day implementing this.p  pThanks,p  pTomp

Negative 457 pI use the excellent FileHelpers library when I work with text data. It allows me to very easily dump text fields from a file or inmemory string into a class that represents the data.p  pIn working with a big endian microcontrollerbased system I need to read a serial data stream. In order to save space on the very limited microcontroller platform I need to write raw binary data which contains field of various multibyte types essentially just dumping a struct variable out the serial port.p  pI like the architecture of FileHelpers. I create a class that represents the data and tag it with attributes that tell the engine how to put data into the class. I can feed the engine a string representing a single record and get an deserialized representation of the data. However, this is different from object serialization in that the raw data is not delimited in any way, its a simple binary fixed record format. p  pFileHelpers is probably not suitable for reading such binary data as strikeit cannot handle the nulls that show up andstrike I suspect that there might be unicode issues the engine takes input as a string, so I have to read bytes from the serial port and translate them into a unicode string before they go to my data converter classes. As an experiment I have set it up to read the binary stream and strikeas long as Im careful to not send nullsstrike it works quite well so far. It is easy to set up new converters that read the raw data and account for endian foratting issues and such. It currently strikefails on nulls andstrike cannot process multiple records it expect a CRLF between records.p  pWhat I want to know is if anyone knows of an opensource library that works similarly to FileHelpers but that is designed to handle binary data.p  pIm considering deriving something from FileHelpers to handle this task, but it seems like there ought to be something already available to do this.p  pIt turns out that it does not complain about nulls in the input stream. I had an unrelated bug in my test program that came up where I expected a problem with the nulls. Should have investigated a little deeper firstp

Negative 457 pI have a problem initializing an array whose size is defined as extern const. I have always followed the rule that global variables should be declared as extern in the header files and their corresponding definitions should be in one of the implementation files in order to avoid variable redeclaration errors. This approach worked fine till I had to initialize an array with whose size is defined as an extern const.  I get an error that a constant expression is expected. However, if I try to assign a value to the const variable the compiler correctly complains that a value cannot be assigned to a constant variable. This actually proves that the compiler does see the variable as a constant. Why then is an error reported when I try to declare an array of the same sizep  pIs there any way to avoid this without using define I would also like to know the reason for this error.p  pPackage.hp  precodeifndef PACKAGEH define PACKAGEH  extern const int SIZE  endif codepre  pPackage.cppp  precodeinclude Package.h  const int SIZE  10 codepre  pFoo.cppp  precodeinclude Package.h  int main       SIZE  5  error  cannot assign value to a constant variable      int Array[SIZE]  error  constant expression expected     return 0  codepre

Negative 457 pIm looking to parallelize some code across a Beowulf cluster, such that the CPUs involved dont share address space.  I want to parallelize a function call in the outer loop.  The function calls do not have any important side effects though they do use a random number generator, allocate memory, etc..  p  pIve looked at libs like MPI and the problem I see is that they seem to make it very nontrivial to pass complex object graphs between nodes.  The input to my function is a this pointer that points to a very complex object graph.  The return type of my function is another complex object graph.  p  pAt a languageagnostic level Im working in the D programming language, and Im almost sure no canned solution is available here, but Im willing to create one, is there a typical way that passing complex state across nodes is dealt with  Ideally, I want the details of how the state is copied to be completely abstracted away and for the calls to look almost like normal function calls.  I dont care that copying this much state over a network isnt particularly efficient, as the level of parallelism in question is so coarsegrained that it probably wont matter.p  pEdit  If there is no easy way to pass complex state, then how is message passing typically used  It seems to me like anything involving copying data over a network requires coarse grained parallelism, yet coarse grained parallelism usually requires passing complex state so that a lot of work can be done in one work unit.p

Negative 457 pThe company I work for is in the business of sending press releases. We want to make it possible for interested parties to search for press releases based on a number of criteria, the most important being location. For example, someone might search for all news sent to New York City, Massachusetts, or ZIP code 89134, sent from a governmental institution, under the topic of traffic. Or whatever.p  pThe problem is, weve sent, literally, hundreds of thousands of press releases. Searching is slow and complex. For example, a press release sent to Queens, NY should show up in the search I mentioned above even though it wasnt specifically sent to New York City, because Queens is a subset of New York City. We may also want to implement and and or and negation and text search to the query to create complex searches. These searches also have to be fast enough to function as dynamic RSS feeds.p  pI really dont know anything about search theory, or how its properly done. The way we are getting by right now is using a data mart to store the locations the releases were sent to in a single table. However, because of the subset thing mentioned above, the data mart is gigantic with millions of rows. And we havent even implemented cities yet, and there are about 50,000 cities in the United States, which will exponentially increase the size of the data mart by so much Im afraid it just wont work anymore.p  pAnyway, I realize this is not a simple question and there wont be a do this answer. However, Im hoping one of you can point me in the right direction where I can learn about how massive searches are done Because I really know nothing about it. And such a search engine is turning out to be incredibly difficult to make. Thanks I know there must be a way because if Google can search the entire internet we must be able to search our own database p

Negative 457 pIm having huge performance issues when I add RMI proxy references to a Java Swing JListcomponent. p  pIm retrieving a list of user codeProfilecodes with RMI from a server. The retrieval itself takes just a second or so, so thats acceptable under the circumstances. However, when I try to add these proxies to a codeJListcode, with the help of a custom codeListModelcode and a codeCellRenderercode, it takes between 3060 seconds to add about 180 objects. Since it is a list of users names, its preferrable to present them alphabetically.p  pThe biggest performance hit is when I sort the elements as they get added to the ListModel. Since the list will always be sorted, I opted to use the builtin codeCollections.binarySearchcode to find the correct position for the next element to be added, and the comparator uses two methods that are defined by the codeProfilecode interface, namely codegetFirstNamecode and codegetLastNamecode.p  pIs there any way to speed this process up, or am I simply implementing it the wrong way Or is this a feature of RMI Id really love to be able to cache some of the data of the remote objects locally, to minimize the remote method calls.p  hr  pemUpdate and possible solutionem I created local classes that implements the remote interfaces and contains a reference to the remote objects. The speed enhancement is noticeable and it now works seemlessly at least so far. I hope this works equally as well for the other interfaces we use in our application. Thanks for the input that I think helped guide me.p

Negative 457 pI am working with Delphi 2009 Pro and just tried to find out why code completion is so slow in my setup. Whenever code completion is invoked, the IDE locks up for up to 30s, which really interrupts any workflow.br When working with BDS 2006, code completion was incredibly fast compared to Delphi 2009.br After reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions898327delphicodecompletionperformancethis posta it seems to be normal for Delphi 2009, but just turning off the automatic code completion is not anything I want to do.p  pMy question isbr If I switch to Delphi 2010, will I have the same slow speed for code completion or was it improved to a point to be usablep  pstrongEDITstrongbr I found the main problem why my IDE was so unresponsive. I used a file MSHTMLTLB.pas, created through the function Import a typelibrary, which is 16MB of code. This file being scanned for code completion froze the IDE for up to 30s. Without that file being in the project, Id say code completion is as fast as it was in previous versions.p

Negative 457 pive got one problem with checkboxes in JSF. I want them to behave dependently on each other, e.g., when i check a box which belongs to some object that has children then all checkboxes that belong to these children components must be checked either. And also when i uncheck one of childs checkbox the parent should be unchecked too. Its pretty simple with plain HTMLjavascript, but i cant do anything with this under JSF. For some reason i cant set IDs for them because all checkboxes are rendered dynamically in a treetable and it prevents me from setting my own IDs, i.e. whatever i set in ID property only constant part will apply, all dynamic data that i pass is ignored.  I tried to do it through valueChangeListener or validator but in both cases after i set needed values something sets them back I dont know who does it and i cant do anything with this.

Negative 457 pIs there any well implemented intrusive double linked list classes available for Java Or should I do my own Boost has it for C a hrefhttpbeta.boost.orgdoclibs1400dochtmlboostintrusivelist.html relnofollowhttpbeta.boost.orgdoclibs1400dochtmlboostintrusivelist.htmla.p  pIntrusive list is a container having in this case next and prev pointers within element, so typical list operations like replace and remove can be directly targeted into elementary class instead of container class. There are some certain situations, where intrusive list are the best solution.p  pI try to give an appropriate example. Lets assume I have linked lists L list1 and L list2 owned by different type of classes X1 and Y2.p  pclass Q which has nothing to do or doesnt easily get access the interfaces of x1 and Y2 otherwise needs to do  i replace, ii remove operation for element e, which exists always in somewhere, in list1 xor list2 depending on runtime state, but that information is not stored directly anywhere.p  pWith intrussive list Q can just store reference to an element to member element e and it always points the right place.p  pOtherwise you have to choose from several clearly more complex workarounds one or the other.  Wrapper class for element e and and additional methods for completing operations i and ii. No.p  pBasically, the question is still not about the performance but architectural complexity.  This can also be understood as one kind of shared object situation where solution IL avoids the update need for every client Lx and Q.p  pPlease notice I do NOT necessary need compatibility to other standard containers. Just an generic intrusive lsit implementation with an iterating, add, remove and find operations used with unknown element class.p  pThanks.p

Negative 457 pIve been asked to create an app that will get data back from a database where the CMS will be Wordpress. Ive never used a CMS so Im trying to get a overviewpicture in my head of how it could all work and what each of the components would be. And what a CMS actually brings to the party.p  pCreating the app itself is pretty clear. Ive done a few already. Ive made a database before and shouldnt cause a problem. p  pBut what is going to be in the middle between the app and the databasep  pPart A Im guessing iphone apps typically would call some php file thats hosted on the server The php then would make a call to the database and return the data somehow, maybe as xml. But this is really basic and wouldnt require a CMS. Just a database and a phpfile, or am I wrongp  pPart B If i wanted to run a check on the database every minute to see if any of the data in database was no longer valid and remove it if needed, that would require somekind of program running on the server. So that program would be Wordpress, since it is managing the content, so a content management system is actually needed and is for these kind of taskes.

Negative 457 pId like to format maths equations using MathML, with LaTeXlike syntax, in my blog posts hosted by Google Blogger but references, on Googles site and elsewhere, to articles on how to conveniently do this seem nonexistent.p  pThe few articles Ive found, on MathML generally, presupposes one can control the contents of an entire page, for example putting tokens in the lthtmlgt tag, which I dont think applies to Google Blogger.p  pThe best site Ive found is Ionel Alexandrus code at a hrefhttpwww.fmath.info relnofollowhttpwww.fmath.infoa But even there the documentation is very sparse and it isnt obvious how one would use his scriptspackages for this.p  pMaybe Im just being thick. But surely people must be using MathML in Google Blogger, and if so Id be very interested in references to how it can best be done preferably via an XML solution rather than dozens of little inline images in the text p  pFailing that, are there standard register and start blogging facilitiessites other than Google Blogger that make it easy to use MathML or where it is available as standardp  pCheersp  pJohn R Ramsdenp

Negative 457 pDear All, Im using dojo.declare to create classes in JavaScript. In one of the methods, Ive an AJAX request. In the load method of that request, I need to execute certain methods.These methods are actually methods of the class that was created using dojo.declare. I tried to execute the method using codethiscode. But it gave me method not found error. So I used codedojo.hitchthis,testMethodcode to invoke it. It worked fine.

Is there any work around for this.p  precode    dojo.declareTestClass,null,      getDatafunctionurl     dojo.xhrGet       urlurl,       load function response         dojo.hitchscope of the current object,testMethodresponse           ,       errorfunction                  ,     testMethodfunctionresponse     calls testMethod2.

Negative 457 pWe have a biztalk server that makes frequent calls to a web service that we also host. p  pThe web service is hosted on 4 servers with a DNS load balancer sitting between them. The theory is that each subsequent call to the service will round robin the servers and balance the load.p  pHowever this does not work presumably because the result of the DNS lookup is cached for a small amount of time on the client. The result is that we get a flood of requests to each server before it moves on to the next.p  pIs that presumption correct and what are the alternative options herep  pa bit more googling has suggested that I can disable client side caching for DNS a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb318803 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb318803ap  p...however this states the default cache time is 1 day which is not consistent with my experiencesp

Behind is a script that fetches the request, parses out the second HTTPS URL and Downloads the source with the custom authorization header and passes the received file bytes and http headers through to the client.p  pI am familiar with Apache2 and PHP, therefore it would be nice to stick with theese. But its not necessary.p  pJust to clarify, we are talking about rapidshare links here. My company is having backup files and storage there, because its the cheapest cloud hosting. There are some job servers that need to fetch files, but I can not configure userpassword on them. So the proxy server should add the premium authentication information.p  pI thought about something likep  pproxy.php  this file is requested using the reverse proxy and served by a webserver this proxy php is written to by a htaccess rewrite rule and by the revery proxy on a hrefhttponeormydomoainsrequesturifromtheoriginalrequest relnofollowhttponeormydomoainsrequesturifromtheoriginalrequesta That is generated in apachep  precodeurl  httpexample.com.SERVER[REQUESTURI] opts  array   httpgtarray     headergtCookie myauthvalueexamplern     context  streamcontextcreateopts streamcontextsetdefaultcontext httpcontent  getheadersurl, 1  ssllocation  httpcontent[Location]  fp  fsockopenssl.parseurlssllocation, PHPURLHOST, 443, errno, errstr, 30 if fp      echo errstr errnoltbr gtn  else      out  GET .parseurlPHPURLPATH, PHPURLHOST.

Negative 457 pIm writing some JavaScript that interacts with a browser plugin addon in FF, ActiveX in IE.  Some of the calls are asynchronous and trigger an event when complete.  There are certain cases where I need to chain calls together, but need to wait for the first call to complete before initiating the second call.  For instancep  pA call to attach a device needs to first check if a device is already attached, and disconnect it.  So the calls would bep  precodepluginObject.disconnectDevicedeviceKey pluginObject.connectDevicedeviceKey, backingInfo codepre  pJust calling them straight up like this would fail because a connect is initiated before the disconnect is actually complete, and the plugin cant handle that.p  pIve already got listeners set up and I can do something likep  precodefunction handleConnectionChangeconnectionState,  ... , doReconnect      if connectionState  state.disconnected ampamp doReconnect          pluginObject.connectDevicedeviceKey, backingInfo       codepre  pstrongBut Id actually like a more generic approach  one that is reusable even with a different set of chained events.strong.  This is simple enough in this particular instance, but even this is a little sloppy.  Ive added reconnect information logic to the connection event handler and I could easily see conditional chaining getting out of hand when done like this.p  pAre there any libraries out there that tackle this kind of workflow  I looked at jQuerys deferred stuff and it has the chaining that I want, but it doesnt really seem to fit with callbacks.  Sproutcores StateCharts look interesting, but again dont seem to have the ability to rework an already asynchronous flow.p  pstrongUpdate Solutionstrong Thanks to some pointers from Gustavo, Ive gone with the approach of wrapping the plugin calls to make them utilize jQuery Deferred objectsp  precodevar connectDevice  functiondeviceKey, backingInfo      var deferred  .Deferred     var connectHandler  functionevent           unregister connectHandler         if event.connectionState  ERROR              showAlertError connecting device, event.message             deferred.reject          else              showAlertDevice connected, event.message              deferred.resolve                     register connectHandler     pluginObject.connectDevicedeviceKey, backingInfo     return deferred.promise  codepre  pIf I make a similar wrapper for disconnecting, I can now chain the method calls or not depending on the flowp  precodeif forceDisconnect      disconnectDevicedeviceKey.doneconnectDevicedeviceKey, backingType  else      connectDevicedeviceKey, backingType  codepre  pI can also start a chain with the connectDevice, or add another function to the forceDisconnect flow, etc.p

Negative 457 pIm working with a mask within a flash document in which text can be entered to create a news archive. Typically, there will be a blurb, and then a link within dynamic text that opens a new web browser tab. What I want to do instead opening a separate tab is to open a lightbox overlay within the same web page. Up to now, Ive used ActionScript within other flash documents to trigger lightbox windows, but I dont think thats going to be an option with this mask. I saw that another user had a similar question. One person suggested an actionscript response and buttons. Thats not going to work from within the dynamic text in this case, I think.  This time, I tried plugging in the lightbox code into the link box for the dynamic text. But Flash really objects. It hides or erases all the dynamic text from the point where I inserted the lightbox trigger forward, and needless to say I cant get to the lighbtox trigger within the .swf file, let alone get it to load.

Negative 457 pI have an object called point that I can move around the screen with my mouse. This object has a vector mapped through it v1 using the center of the stage and points x,y location in order to draw the vector note all of this is working fine. My problem is occurring when I set up was a button that simply sets a value to true if you press it. The idea behind this button is that when pressed, whatever location point is at, it will move 1 degree clockwise in a circle around the center of the stage this is all happening in the frameHandler so I can keep clicking the button to make it continue around the stage. The code I am using is based in an if statement listed belowp  precodeifclockwisePressed      var v1angleNumber  v1.angle     v1angle increase the angle by 1 degree     ifv1anglegt180          v1angle  360          Now just move the crosshair and get it ready to be redrawn     point.x  centerX  v1.m  Math.cosv1angle     point.y  centerY  v1.m  Math.sinv1angle     clockwisePressed  false remove button pressed boolean  codepre  pSo what is happening here is that clockwisePressed has been set to true so this fires off. My vector v1 is set up to tell me the angle already converted from radians to degrees but its a readonly value. So I assign it v1.angle to v1angle so I can mess with it and increase it by 1 so Im moving clockwise around the center of the stage. Then I just check to make sure that it falls into a range between 180 and 180 if I trace v1.angle around the stage, 0 degrees is to the left, 90 degrees is straight up, 180 degrees is to the right, and 90 is straight down. Now using the formula I derived from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2887513findthepointwithradiusandanglethis threada but converted to work with 0 degrees pointing to the left and the value for Y going up the further down the stage you go, I came up withp  precodex  centerX  radius  cosangle y  centerY  radius  sinangle codepre  pNow when I make a sample chart on paper and use these values on my calculator, this works like a charm. If I plug in an angle, the radius, and center I get a point right on my circle I draw on a sheet of graph paper. However, when I actually try this in flash, the point jumps all over the stage. Note that v1.m  is just the magnitude of the vector between the center of the stage and point which is the same as the radius.p  pSo I trace everything and the values for cos and sin dont seem to be coming out right. For example, if my angle is 1.9581 and I take the cos of that on my calculator I get something along the lines of 0.9994 but flash traces Math.cosangle to be 0.3777. Isnt using Math.cos1.9581 the same as putting 1.9581 into your calculator and hitting cosp  pSo in the case of my example above, my point.x went from 139.95 to 261.3. Quite a big jump for what was supposed to be 1 degree. So Im at a loss here as to what is causing this code to fail so drastically. Am I doing something wrong herep  pUPDATE If anyone who searches this topic is interested, below is the corrected code that worksp  precodeifclockwisePressed      var v1RadAngleNumber  Math.atan2v1.vy, v1.vx get angle in radians     v1RadAngle  0.0174 increase the angle by 1 degree more or less     Now just move the crosshair and get it ready to be redrawn     point.x  centerX  v1.m  Math.cosv1RadAngle v1.m  radius     point.y  centerY  v1.m  Math.sinv1RadAngle     clockwisePressed  false remove button pressed boolean  codepre

The same thing happens with QStrings.  I presume that the trouble arises from the fact that stdstring contains an internal pointer, so sizeof just returns the size of the pointer, but given that stdstrings behave like values otherwise , , etc. I dont see why that entails failure here.p  pAlso, for compatibility with other code I need to use C arrays here, not e.g. stdvector.

Negative 457 pEDIT Have updated the code, The remaining problem is that i need to wait for the The thread  has exited with code 0 to fire before I can make a new search. If i dont the button events fire, but not the pageLoad. Is there a way to handle itp  pI am creating a aspx webpage localhost to study for a certification. The page contains a grindview that presents data, a search box and a button to summit searches. I use Linq to get the result from the database, querystring to store the search while postback and the Cache to store the non searched result. The page loads slow the first time and load fast after a refresh so the caching probably works.

Thing is, it doesnt.p  pWhat am I doing wrong here Am I going totally bonkers and theres a much easier way of doing this but only I cant see itp  pAny help here would be appreciated.p  pThanks in advancep

Hence, if one of these methods are called after isImmutable is set to true, then they should throw an exception called ImmutableException.  For this particular implementation, I want to be able to handle these myself instead of going to every single point in the code that these methods are called and handling them then exact same way.p

Negative 457 pIm trying to implement saving users data in my application. Ive created special method named saveUserInfo which is called when user logs out and for this event everything works great just as i want it to. Also i want users data to be saved when the apps execution is over, so ive put my saveUserInfo method into applicationWillTerminate and applicationDidEnterBackground methods. And that works partly. When i press HOME button  applicationDidEnterBackground is called and saveUserInfo works as it supposed to. But when i press Stop the running scheme or application button in my Xcode 4 neither applicationWillTerminate nor applicationDidEnterBackground are called so users info is not saved. What am i doing wrong Or maybe im doing everything correctly and applicationWillTerminate and applicationDidEnterBackground are not supposed to get called by pressing Stop the running scheme or application button in Xcode I just cant find satisfactory answer p

Negative 457 pHi Im building a program that uses a signal handler shown below ...p  precodestruct sigaction pipeIn pipeIn.sahandler  updateServer sigemptysetamppipeIn.samask pipeIn.saflags  SAONESHOT  ifsigactionSIGUSR1, amppipeIn, NULL  1      printfWe have a problem, sigaction is not working.n     perrorn     exit1       codepre  pThe problem is that this handler is getting tripped when its not supposed to. The only thing that should send the SIGUSR1 signal is my child process which exists inside an infinite while loop which listens for incoming connections. The child process is forked as you can see below. I redo the pipeIn handler to run a different function that the child process uses which the parent does not. The code is shown below.p  precodewhile1      newSock  acceptlistenSock,struct sockaddr amptheiraddr,ampaddrsize     printfAn     iffork      We want to redefine the interrupt         pidt th         th  getpid         printfchild pid dn,th         pipeIn.sahandler  setFlag         ifsigactionSIGUSR1, amppipeIn, NULL  1              printfWe have a problem, sigaction is not working.n             perrorn             exit1                        closelistenSock         killgetppid,SIGUSR1         waitForP                   closenewSock                  exit0          closenewSock     waitForP     break  codepre  pWhen I run this code, I will make a call from another computer to connect to my server program that you see here. It will codeacceptcode the one request from that computer just fine, but then the child process will eventually get around to sending SIGUSR1 to the parent process. However the parent process receives the SIGUSR1 signal before the child process even gets to send the signal. The handler trips the function before it should ... then the child process finally gets to kill the signal and the handler goes off the 2nd time. Lastly the codeacceptcode function goes off again even if there are no new connections being produced and the incoming ip address is from a weird ipv6 address that is random. I dont know whats going on. Any help would be great.p

Negative 457 pHi everyone new to MVC and I need to trim some 20s off of my data so it will display correctly. At the moment my CRUD displays the index correctly and it is able to edit user created records but when I try to edit a record that was from the legacy database it doesnt work and throws an error that the resource cannot be found. I looked closer at the URL for the legacy database records and saw that following most of the database records was 2020202020. This told me that the database records were being followed by extra white space since that is what 20 meaning is. I did some research and found that the Trim  function could get rid of the extraneous characters for me. I just dont understand how to use the trim function in my specific situation. p  pI think that I need to use the function in my Controller under my Edit ActionResult but when I tried it in a few different spots I had no luck. I thought that I understood how this function works but with no change in result for the better I am stuck. I hope that this explains the problem well enough, below I have posted the code for my controller with my CRUD methods in it but if you need me to post any other classes let me know. p  pYou may notice that I have left a trim method in my edit method, this was my attempt at solving the problem and can easily be removed if I am completely wrong, and since it didnt work I believe I am Thanks for your help if you need my edit class just ask I will be checking back often And for anyone reading this to help them solve the same problem I will be sure and post the solution once it has been solved  p  h2PaControllerh2  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Web using System.Web.Mvc using DBFirstMVC.Models using System.Data  namespace DBFirstMVC.Controllers      public class PaController  Controller              PaEntities db  new PaEntities                   GET Pa          public ActionResult Index                      using var db  new PaEntities                              return Viewdb.iampmapping.ToList                                          GET PaDetails5          public ActionResult Detailsint id                      return View                             GET PaCreate          public ActionResult Create                      return View                              POST PaCreate          [HttpPost]         public ActionResult Createiampmapping IAMP                      try                              using var db  new PaEntities                                      db.iampmapping.AddIAMP                     db.SaveChanges                                   return RedirectToActionIndex                          catch                              return View                                          GET PaEdit5          public ActionResult Editstring id                       using var db  new PaEntities                               string trimmedID  id.Trim                 return Viewdb.iampmapping.FindtrimmedID                                          POST PaEdit5          [HttpPost]         public ActionResult Editstring id, iampmapping IAMP                      try                              using var db  new PaEntities                                      db.EntryIAMP.State  EntityState.Modified                     db.SaveChanges                     return RedirectToAction                                           catch                              return View                                          GET PaDelete5          public ActionResult Deletestring id                      using var db  new PaEntities                               return Viewdb.iampmapping.Findid                                          POST PaDelete5          [HttpPost]         public ActionResult Deletestring id, iampmapping IAMP                      try                              using var db  new PaEntities                                      db.EntryIAMP.State  EntityState.Deleted                     db.SaveChanges                     return RedirectToAction                                            catch                              return View                             codepre

Negative 457 pI have the following doubt. When you have to query a DB from a Java application there are several ways to do it. I have came up with some approaches, but each of them have a con.p  pThe first one is, you have a class eg. codeQueryManagercode which provides you with querying functionalities, like codeexecuteUpdate...code and codeexecuteQuery...code while hiding details of the management of connections etc. Kind of a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFacadepattern relnofollowemFacade Patternema. When you need to interact with the DB, you will pass the query as a String and manage the codeResultSetcode.p  pThe problem that I see is that if the DB changes, whether the DBMS or the DB itself, you will end up going file by file modifying the SQL. I see this as a huge dependency. Also, you are exposing to everyone the stucture of your DB and you are making each class to handle the codeResultSetcode. On the other hand, you could achive higher modularity by using this method, since the models I am a fan of ema hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiModelE28093viewE28093controller relnofollowMVC Patternaem of your classes could have package visibility.p  pThe second idea that came to my mind was creating a codeQueryManagercode class that instead of providing you with the methods for querying, it will provide you with the methods you need. In other words, each time you need to use the DB, you will create a method in this class, with the SQL inside, that will return the information you need. But, the problem we are facing here is, you have to choose between returning a codeResultSetcode or a model of the data you need.br The former, will make your classes dependant on the DB, less than in the previous example, since now there is no widely spread dependency with the DBMS, because all the SQL is contained in one classfile. However it still exists a dependency with the DB structure and you are exposing, as well, your DB structure to everyone.br The later implies that theese models no longer could be package visibility, they must be public, allowing any class to modify them, and breaking encapsulation. p  pIs there any other approach that solves all the previous problems If not, which do you think is a better approachp  pI do not think there is an absolute answear maybe there is, but I must say that we are expecting changes in both the structure of the DB and in the DBMS. This might help in your answear. But try to make it as general as possible, since I could be in other project with the same doubt, but no with the same restrictions.p

Negative 457 pI have this problem with a WPF application, when the properties of control changes they do not get refreshed visually I am using snoop and I can see that the property is set correctly but it does not affect the control. I noticed that if I change the size it get refresh and it corrects the appearance of the control .p  pThis application has multiple pages controls which inherit page and there is navigation bar to navigate to each of these pages. There is an option in the menu that let the user to change a visual property FlowDirection of the controls this calls a method which loads a resource dictionary which apply new styles for whole framework elements. I noticed that if the user change it by using that menu item, all the controls in the page which is displaying are get refreshed and it works fine. But when we navigate to the other pages some control are refreshed and some of them not as I mentioned earlier I used snoop and it shows that the correct value is set for the property of the controls in all other pages, and if I resize the page they get in to the correct positionp  pI tried InvalidateVisual , InvalidateArrange , InvalidateMeasure, and none of them helped .p  pThe code is in WPF C, .NET 4.0p  pAny suggestionp

Negative 457 pSo Ive got a MySQL database with 2 tables in it. p  pThe main files Im working with are index.php, jquery.js, jfunc.js, and urlmappingDB.php.p  pMy main question pertains to the first 3. In index.php, Im displaying the data from the data tables made in urlmappingDB.php in html  tags. When I click the update button under the table Ild like to display the updated MySQL table data in the corresponding position in the html table. I get the feeling that my current jquery code isnt going to suffice for updating a table since the variable it passes into the POST array is pretty much an arbitrary variable in my program. p  pThat said, my employer would prefer I use jquery for this, so Im sort of stumped on how to implement this.

Negative 457 pI am working on a study that sends people a PDF document with information about their health. The team would like to know if the person has actually opened the PDF document a sign that they didnt just ignore the email. I know that itd be possible to do it with a link to an external file, but the users are much less likely to click on a URL and download it then they are to just view an attachment, and we dont want to do anything that might prevent the users from reading the information weve already had people say they never received the message, and with further investigation they discovered they had, they had just ignored it.p  pAnother option is to request a read report, but this is only useful if it doesnt annoy the user ie it does it automatically when the email is opened instead of requesting them to send one. Were currently looking into this as well, but the ability to check if the attachment has been opened is a much better idea.p  pThe email is generated in MS SQL and sent using the database mail system, and we have adobe acrobat pro, so creating scripts in pdfs is possible although Im not sure whether those scripts will be allowed to run.p  pThanksp

Negative 457 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comhighgroovezonebie relnofollowZonebiea to randomize the time zone in my tests. Its all working fine for my rspec tests, but Im having an issue with my cucumber tests. It works by selecting a random timezone from codeActiveSupportcode and setting codeTime.zonecode.

However, if I put a codedebugggercode statement in a model function, it prints the default time zone as set up in my codeconfigapplication.rbcode.p  pIs Time.zone being reset somewhere or does the change go out of scope somehow Any ideasp  pstrongNBstrong Im also using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comtravisjefferytimecop relnofollowTimecopa gem if that has any implications.p
Negative 457 pA simple question, but the answer is not obvious to me For performance reasons, which maptype or maybe non maptype container should I, from a performance perspective, best use in the following scenariop  ul likeys are unsigned integer numbers,li liinsertions are frequent,li liread access is even more frequent and random access,li liitems are inserted with ascending key values first inserted item has key 0, next one key 1 and so on,li liitems are removed randomly so sooner or later the list of keys will have holes, as the corresponding items have been deleted. Removal is almost as frequent as insertion.li ul  pI hesitate to use codestdmapcode, as ascending key order and frequent removal seem to imply continuous rebalancing of the search tree, which to me seems to be a waste of performance.p  pIn other words Can I gain performance from the fact that I know in advance what the keys of the items will be and even the order in which the keys will appear for insertion I do not know the total number of items, though.p

Negative 457 pIm asking for something thats a bit weird, but here is my requirement which is all a bit computation intensive, which I couldnt find anywhere so far..p  pI need a collection of codeltTKey, TValuegtcode of about 30 items. But the collection is used in massively nested codeforeachcode loops that would iterate possibly almost up to a billion times, seriously. The operations on collection are trivial, something that would look likep  precode DictionaryltPosition, Valuegt cells  new    cells.Clear cells.AddPosition.p1, v1 cells.AddPosition.p2, v2 etc codepre  pIn short, nothing more than addition of about 30 items and clearing of the collection. Also the values will be read from somewhere else at some point. I need this readingretrieval by the key. So I need something along the lines of a codeDictionarycode. Now since Im trying to squeeze out every ounce from the CPU, Im looking for some microoptimizations as well. For one, I do not require the collection to check if a duplicate already exists while adding this typically makes dictionary slower when compared to a codeListltTgtcode for addition. I know I wont be passing duplicates as keys. p  pSince codeAddcode method would do some checks, I tried this insteadp  precodecells[Position.p1]  v1  cells[Position.p2]  v2 etc codepre  pBut this is still about 200 ms seconds slower for about 10k iterations than a typical codeListltTgtcode implementation like thisp  precodeListltKeyValuePairltPosition, Valuegtgt cells  new    cells.Addnew KeyValuePairltPosition, ValuegtPosition.p1, v1 cells.Addnew KeyValuePairltPosition, ValuegtPosition.p2, v2 etc codepre  pNow that could scale to a noticeable time after full iteration. emNote that in the above case I have read item from list by index which was ok for testing purposesem. The problem with a regular codeListltTgtcode for us are many, the main reason being not being able to access an item by key. p  pMy question in short arep  ol lipIs there a custom collection class that would let access item by key, yet bypass the duplicate checking while adding Any 3rd party open source collection would do.pli lipOr else please point me to a good starter as to how to implement my custom collection class from codeIDictionaryltTKey, TValuegtcode interfacepli ol  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI went by MiMos suggestion and List was still faster. Perhaps it has got to do with overhead of creating the dictionary.p

Negative 457 pSo far Ive not been able to hit on the right way to do it.  Ive got an inputText bound to a variable in an object.  Ive got a selectOneMenu item dropdown all full of goodness.  The thought was that when selected, Id just push the selected text from the dropdown into the input box simulating typing it.  Apparently thats a no go.  I can grab the text of the selected element in a javascript onselect handler easily enough, but the inputText refuses to accept it presumably choosing to redisplay the stored empty string rather than accept this as input and push it to the object.  Ive also tried setting the string directly in Java, but with the exact same results of nothing happening.  Apparently my entire approach is flawed.

Negative 457 pI came across this question in a coding competitionp  pYoure given an array of positive integers and are allowed to change the sign of any of the integers whenever you require. Write a program to calculate the minimum sum of this array. This sum should be  0. For example  Array  1,2,4,5 then sum  0 as we change sign of 1 and 5 1,2,4,5p  pMy solution to the problem was to sort the array and find the sum of all the members. I would then iteratively decrease 2sorted array value  from the sumstarting from the largest number  till sum becomes 0 or till it becomes negative. p  pBut my solution is wrong.

Im doing it like that at the timep  precode stream for reading byte arrays InputStream stream  process.getInputStream  reader for reading String lines BufferedReader reader  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderstream  String msg  reader.readLine  if msg  data16 byte[] bytes  new byte[16] stream.readbytes codepre  pWhen I get a line strongdata16strong from emreaderem it means byte array of 16 bytes follow. And the problem is if I try to read the bytes from emstreamem I get the data16 ASCII codes. So that means the stream doesnt update the position when I read with emreaderem. Is there a way to synchronize their positions  I know DataInputStream can do both read byte arrays and read lines. But its codereadLinecode method is deprecated and it cant convert bytes properly to characters.p  pThe bytes can also contain 0, 10 and 13 and all other bytes up to 255p  pPerformance is important so I dont really want to read byteafterbyte or charafterchar. Also if possible I would like to avoid to manually count the bytes and chars read to use the skip methods then.p

Negative 457 pI wanted to reach out to the web community and find out how teams manage large binary files PSDs, Videos, audio, etc in web projects. For years our team has used SVN to sync assets between individuals working on a project, but its showing some weaknesses. Here is a breakdown of what weve tried.p  p1 SubversionGit. The files are huge and smaller incremental changes bloat the SVN repo size when you commit them back in. This makes backing up the repo an issue. Designers tend to have issues with the concepts of SVN and is not intuitive the their workflow. When a conflict happens its usually a bit of a mess.p  p2 Cloud services. Weve tried storing files on the cloud and have them sync. The problem here is when you save a change to a PSD for example, the whole file will get syncd to the cloud. The solution here would be making a working copy of the cloud folder, but it can easily get out of sync pretty quickly.p  p3 FTP. This is how we originally worked, each connected to an FTP and uploaded the latest work. Was more tedious than SVN, and syncing issues were common place.p  pAny thoughts on the matter would be very helpful p  pThanksp

Negative 457 pI have an external hard drive, called MyDisk  I also run a command to scp a folder from another server to my external hard drive. The problem is  my scp downloads the backups to a folder mediaMyDisk but this takes up the hard disk space on the main hard drive.p  pI need to be able to write these straight to the hard drive without download to mediaMyDisk as this is essentially like downloading the files to homemyuser or another local folderp  pWhen I look directly on MyDisk I see my backups, but even when I eject the drive and look in mediaMyDisk  the backups are there.p  pIs it possible to just download them directly to MyDisk without involving media folder I notice that when you want to change directory in the terminal you go through cd mediaMyDisk but is there a way to avoid using this local folderp  pReally confused, any help would be greatp

Ive implemented the logic from the linked question, and some additional logic for my extra requirements. However this seems to cause the following two showstoppersp  ul lipIn the mousePressEvent, setting the item under the mouse to not have the movable and selectable flags, calling the base class, and then reapplying the flags causes the item to become frozen.

Negative 457 pI Really would appreciate it if someone can help me with this. I am trying to do external sorting and I am stuck on the part of merging. I get how I should merge it just not sure what function to use. p  pRight now I am trying to read in the first words of multiple small text files and store them in a string array of the size of the amount of files. So basically I will have a string array of the first word of each file. Then I determine which one is the smallest alphabetically wise and write that to a new file, after that I would read the next word of the file of that smallest word. This word would be placed in the position of the smallest word that got outputted in string array and compare it to the rest of the first word from the other file. This will keep repeating till all words are sorted. p  pThe main problem I am running into is the fact that I was using scanner and after the first run of comparing it cant switch the smallest word with the next word in the file because scanner dont keep a point of what it has read. I know readline do but since my files are all words separated by only a white space I cant use readline.

Negative 457 pI have an application built using MFC that I need to add BonjourZeroconf service discovery to. Ive had a bit of trouble figuring out how best to do it, but Ive settled on using the DLL stub provided in the mDNSresponder source code and linking my application to the static lib generated by that which in turn uses the system dnssd.dll.p  pHowever, Im still having problems as the callbacks dont always seem to be being called so my device discovery stalls. What confuses me is that it all works absolutely fine under OSX, using the OSX dnssd terminal service and under Windows using the dnssd command line service. On that basis, Im ruling out the client service as being the problem and trying to figure out whats wrong with my Windows code.p  pIm basically calling DNSBrowseService, then in that callback calling DNSServiceResolve, then finally calling DNSServiceGetAddrInfo to get the IP address of the device so I can connect to it.p  pAll of these calls are based on using WSAAsyncSelect like this p  precodeDNSServiceErrorType err  DNSServiceResolveampclient,kDNSServiceFlagsWakeOnResolve,                                                     interfaceIndex,                                                     serviceName,                                                     regtype,                                                     replyDomain,                                                     ResolveInstance,                                                     context      iferr  0               err  WSAAsyncSelectSOCKET DNSServiceRefSockFDclient, pgtmhWnd, MESSAGEHANDLEMDNSEVENT, FDREADFDCLOSE      codepre  pBut sometimes the callback just never gets called even though the service is there and using the command line will confirm that.p  pIm totally stumped as to why this isnt 100 reliable, but it is if I use the same DLL from the command line. My only possible explanation is that the DNSServiceResolve function tries to call the callback function before the WSAAsyncSelect has registered the handling message for the socket, but I cant see any way around this.p  pIve spent ages on this and am now completely out of ideas. Any suggestions would be welcome, even if theyre thats a really dumb way to do it, why arent you doing X, Y, Z. p

Negative 457 pThis is a question regarding making web requests using Http verbs other than GET,POST,DELETE,PUT etc in the Android platform. I can perfectly do a post in my requests using HttpPost and even attach a JSON string to it.However if I have a custom Http verb , Android does not support it directly via existing apis,though I could do that in iOS using setRequestMethod.I did come across HttpURLConnection class that lets me set the request method,however it limits me to POST,GET,DELETE,PUT and throws up an error if any other Http verb is used. I understand that classes like HttpPost,HttpGet,HttpPut etc extend HttpEntityEnclosingRequest class which in turn extends HttpRequestBase and that my solution would be around tweaking these classes and eventually attaching a JSON stringjust like we attach JSON strings to a HttpPost object.p  pI just cant figure out how to do it.Kindly help.p

I would like to remove all of these for sorting purposes and clarity sake.  p  pWhat would be the best way to go about this  If anyone could help Id appreciate itp  pThanks. p
Negative 457 pAbstract classes in Java are classes which cannot be instantiated, meaning we cannot create new instances of an abstract class. The purpose of an abstract class is to function as a base for subclasses. but why java allows to define data member in an emabstract classem, where we can not create object of an abstract class.p

Nothing seems to happen to my string str1 when I execute my code and Im having difficulty figuring out why, maybe I shouldnt be processing my array as such, but nonetheless, heres the codep  precode        .386         .MODEL FLAT          str1   dword  aBcD, cr, Lf, 0         ....          .code start         output str1         sub esi, esi                  sum  0         lea ebx, str1 top    mov al, [ebx  esi]             attempting to move each character value from                                                      str1 into the register al for comparison and                                         possible conversion to uppercase         add esi, 5         cmp al, 0         je zero         sub al, 20h                   convert lowercase to corresponding uppercase         loop top zero   output zeromsg                  for TESTING of al purposes only done   output str1value         output str1 codepre  pNothing changes , and on top of the conversion not taking place, the string it printing in reverse order. why prints out as DcBa. Any inquiry would be appreciated Thanks in advance.p

Negative 457 pI have a function which is called many times. The function has several DECLARE statements in the body of it.p  pIm wondering what the impact of this is if the function is called say, 100,000 times, and if there is a way to make the declaration global such that the same variable is reused each time rather than being allocateddeallocated constantly.p  pI might be thinking too much like a regular programmer in the way that SQL works, but ultimately I need to streamline it as much as possible to improve performance as currently its shockingly bad.p

Negative 457 pIm very new to storyboards and objectivec in general. Basically, I have a welcome screen with 4 buttons on it. Each button loads a new scene via the codemodalcode way. One of the screens requires an internet connection. I have already setup the function to check to see if there is internet. If there is no connection, Id like it to load a separate scene. It looks like this codewebViewcode is the name of my codeUIWebViewcodep  precodevoidwebViewUIWebView myWebView didFailLoadWithErrorNSError error  code  codepre  pNow, the only issue Im having is how to load the scene that it should direct to in this function. I have the feeling that I need to start by creating an outlet for this specific scene, but Im unsure of how to even do that. I tried searching for a guide on how to do it, but it is all going over my head since Im so new to programming. Any help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 457 pIm creating a windows program shown below that contains two OpenGL rendering contexts. Usually when I program using OpenGL, I use the GLUT library functions for the creation and callback registration for my drawing contexts. p  pHowever as Im embedding these contexts into Windows Forms GLUTwould create them each with their own main window complete with windows min,max and X buttons, Ive been forced to create the windows without using GLUT, as SystemWindowsFormsNativeWindows that have been enabled as OpenGL contexts using wgl functions. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPkI5x.png altThe kind of OGL views Im working withp  pI however, now have a need to use functions like glutMouseFunc and glutPassiveMotionFunc in order to process user input in these views These are the functions I usually use for dealing with mouse input. But because these windows werent created using glutCreateWindow I seriously doubt I will be able to use these GLUT functions in association with them. I experimented with glutCreatSubwindow however this only creates subwindows of another GLUTcreated windowsp  pWhat Im currently looking for is a way to process mouse clicks, coordinates amp movements on these OpenGL enabled forms  NativeWindows. Whether that be using the System namespace another GL or GLUT function that I dont know about or anything else. Ill also include the code parent class that both views inherit their constructor from, so that you can see how theyre created.  p  precodepublic ref class COpenGL         public SystemWindowsFormsNativeWindow                  public             COpenGLSystemWindowsFormsForm  parentForm, GLsizei iWidth, GLsizei iHeight                      CreateParams cp  gcnew CreateParams                set its position on the parent form             cpgtX  12             cpgtY  27             cpgtHeight  iHeight             cpgtWidth  iWidth              set the height and width for the benefit of the derived classes,             so that they can find out their own size using the getHeight amp width funcs             currentWidth  cpgtWidth             currentHeight  cpgtHeight              Specify the form as the parent             cpgtParent  parentFormgtHandle              create as a child of the specified parent             and make OPENGL compliant             cpgtStyle  WSCHILDWSVISIBLEWSCLIPSIBLINGSWSCLIPCHILDREN              create the window             thisgtCreateHandlecp              mhDC  GetDCHWNDthisgtHandle.ToPointer              ifmhDC                              wglMakeCurrentmhDC,NULL                 MySetPixelFormatmhDC                 ReSizeGLSceneiWidth,iHeight                 InitGL                                  virtual void Render                      simple render, just refresh the buffers for now             glClearColor1.0f,0.5f,0.5f,1.0f             glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT                   void SwapOpenGLBuffers                      SwapBuffersmhDC               protected         HDC mhDC         HGLRC mhglrc   GLint MySetPixelFormatHDC hdc                      PIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR pfd                    sizeofPIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR,     size of this pfd                  1,                                 version number                  PFDDRAWTOWINDOW                support window                  PFDSUPPORTOPENGL                support OpenGL                  PFDDOUBLEBUFFER,                  double buffered                  PFDTYPERGBA,                     RGBA type                  24,                                24bit color depth                  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,                  color bits ignored                  0,                                 no alpha buffer                  0,                                 shift bit ignored                  0,                                 no accumulation buffer                  0, 0, 0, 0,                        accum bits ignored                  32,                                32bit zbuffer                      0,                                 no stencil buffer                  0,                                 no auxiliary buffer                  PFDMAINPLANE,                    main layer                  0,                                 reserved                  0, 0, 0                            layer masks ignored                             GLint  iPixelFormat                get the device contexts best, available pixel format match              ifiPixelFormat  ChoosePixelFormathdc, amppfd  0                              MessageBoxShowChoosePixelFormat Failed                 return 0                            make that match the device contexts current pixel format              ifSetPixelFormathdc, iPixelFormat, amppfd  FALSE                              MessageBoxShowSetPixelFormat Failed                 return 0                           ifmhglrc  wglCreateContextmhDC  NULL                              MessageBoxShowwglCreateContext Failed                 return 0                           ifwglMakeCurrentmhDC, mhglrc  NULL                              MessageBoxShowwglMakeCurrent Failed                 return 0                           return 1                     bool InitGLGLvoid                                      All setup for opengl goes here                       glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION                 glLoadIdentity             gluOrtho2D0,currentWidth,0,currentHeight these will be set be now so its safe to use them                                                         also makes sure were drawing from the bottom left             glShadeModelGLSMOOTH                           Enable smooth shading             glClearColor0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f                Black background             glClearDepth1.0f                                    Depth buffer setup             glDepthFuncGLLEQUAL                              The type of depth testing to do             glHintGLPERSPECTIVECORRECTIONHINT, GLNICEST   Really nice perspective calculations             glEnableGLBLEND             glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHAactivate the alpha blending functionality             glLineWidth2          Width of the drawing line             glDisableGLDEPTHTEST             glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW              return TRUE                                         Initialisation went ok               codepre

Negative 457 pFor my iOS application, I need to convert an MP3 File Stored in a NSData object to AAC format which will also be stored in a NSData object to be later streamed. Im also doing some DSP in between the conversion, so Im taking advantage of AudioFileOpenWithCallbacks to open the existing, inMemory, MP3 File and this works fine.p  pHowever, Im having trouble creating a readable AAC file using AudioFileInitializeWithCallbacks AFIWCB to fill up an NSMutableData object. To test the audio, Im writing the NSMutableData object to disk when the conversion is done, but when I examine the metadata on this file, there is no bit rate or channel information and the file is unplayable. The file size is approximately correct though.p  pAnd if I skip over AFIWCB and write directly to disk using ExtAudioFileCreateWithURL, it works perfectly, though writing to disk is undesirable for my application.p  pDoes anyone have any familiarity using AFIWCB to write audio to an inmemory buffer The documentation isnt very clear and I have a feeling Im leaving something out or not using the callbacks correctly.p  pThanks for any help you can provide.p  pEDIT Figured out my problem, it was in the outputWriteProc Callback.

Negative 457 pI have a restaurant application i am building that allows restaurants to create menus online. Right now our page loads 6 items on initial page load, and then an infinite scroll interaction takes over as they continue to scroll down the page and dynamically loads 6 more items through ajax. p  pEverything is working, but im having trouble limiting the fields of my database associations. For example, my items have their own sizes, which are established in the item model withp  precodehasmany sizes codepre  pand then i access those sizes using p  precodeitem.sizes codepre  pto organize my data for return through json, i use the following method although i am quite welcoming to improvements in this methodp  precodeitems  Item.whereblah blah items.each do item     item[sizes]  item.sizes end  render json gt items gt items codepre  pall of this works and is simple enough, but when i try to limit the selected columns returned from the database, i start to get strange behavior. Im not sure what is causing it. I have tried doing thisp  precodeitem[sizes]  item.sizes.selectid, name, price codepre  pand i have tried doing this as wellp  precodeitem[sizes]  item.sizes.tojsononly gt [id, name, price] codepre  pboth of these methods work to return only the requested fields ON THE SERVER SIDE, but something seems to happen to it between the request and the return to the web browser my guess is that it is caused by the render method that seems to be undoing my unique field selectors and instead sending back all of the database data so instead of only id, name, price, i am receiving about 20 unnecessary fields of data.p  pIm really looking for any suggestions that might help make this work, no matter how strange they are. Also, if anybody has any other information on ways to improve query times, that would be much appreciated as well. I have already covered all of the basic tutorials, and i am already using eager loading before accessing the items I wonder if that has anything to do with my problems, but i am desparately trying to find good solutions to prevent the bottleneck being caused by these tojson and render json methods. right now a series of queries that takes about 400 ms on the database is taking an additional 1000 ms in render json. p

The issue may be here in my UnitOfWorkp  precodepublic interface IUnitOfWork  IDisposable      void Commit       inventory     IRepositoryltComputerEntitygt Computers  get      IRepositoryltNetworkAdapterEntitygt NetworkAdapters  get       ... plus a bunch more   public class UnitOfWork  IUnitOfWork      private readonly ReportingDbContext dbContext  null      public UnitOfWork              dbContext  new ReportingDbContext           public void Commit              dbContext.SaveChanges            Inventory     public IRepositoryltComputerEntitygt Computers get  return new RepositoryltComputerEntitygtdbContext      public IRepositoryltNetworkAdapterEntitygt NetworkAdapters  get  return new RepositoryltNetworkAdapterEntitygtdbContext        ... lots more  codepre  pThis UnitOfWork has been great is that I can do a bunch of stuff to all my repositories and save it in one shot without having a bunch of contexts floating around to synchronize. It may or may not be relevant to this question, but this is how my UnitOfWork uses the repository. There is only 1 repository class, but it can be fed with any entity type neededp  precodepublic interface IRepositoryltTgt where T  class      IQueryableltTgt GetAll     IQueryableltTgt FindExpressionltFuncltT, boolgtgt predicate     T GetByIdint id     void RemoveT entity     void AddT newEntity   public class RepositoryltTgt  IRepositoryltTgt where T  class      protected DbContext DbContext  get set      protected DbSetltTgt DbSet  get set       public RepositoryDbContext dbContext              if dbContext  null                      throw new ArgumentNullExceptiondbContext                  DbContext  dbContext         DbSet  DbContext.SetltTgt           public IQueryableltTgt GetAll              return DbSet         ... more implementation of the interface, nothing fancy  codepre  pThe endpoint of where this magic is used is inside my WCF service. This is where I want to actually run through an integration test. A particular method in my service initializes a unit of work and uses that do stuff. The UnitOfWork creates a ReportingDbContext when it is newd up, and this ReportingDbContext in turn refers to the connection string of nameReportingDbContext. After much reading, I think the answer is to use an IoC container like Unity or Ninject havent used one before, but Id like to, and Im stuck on how to implement IoC in this situation. Here is an example method that Im using in my WCF service that seems rather hardcoded to the live database connection stringp  precodepublic ComputerDTO GetComputerDetailsstring hostname, string client    dont worry about the return type, its defined elsewhere     using var uoW  new UnitOfWork              var repo  uoW.Computers         var computer  repo.Findx gt x.Hostname  hostname ampamp x.CompanyEntity.Name  client.FirstOrDefault          do stuff       codepre  pId like to keep my connection strings inside my app.config if at all possible and be able to somehow switch to the testing connection string during the [SetUp] part of my NUnit testing of the methods in my WCF service.p

Negative 457 pI have a WPF application written for the .NET 4 Full Framework.  The application uses SQL Anywhere as its database. My application has an unhandled exception handler, which always logs errors to a custom event log for the program.  It then displays the error message to the user.  The program also sends messages to the event log whenever its about to do something in order too make debugging it easier.p  pThe application is installed on a users laptop, which is running Windows 7 and has 8 GB of RAM.  When it is started on this machine, the splash screen is displayed and then the programs main window is displayed.  Less than a second after being drawn, the program dies.  There are no error messages displayed.p  pChecking the event log shows that the programs last message written was that it was doing a check for the existence of a user in the database.  There are no error messages.p  pThe code that follows the last message that was displayed is a call to a method that does some parameter checking and then executes the following EF queryp  precodeLPRCore.CarSystem.User user  null  IQueryableltUsergt query  from u in context.Users                          from m in context.Members.Where m gt m.UserId  u.UserId                                                    .DefaultIfEmpty                          where u.LoweredUserName  userName.ToLower ampamp m  null                          select u try      user  query.SingleOrDefault   catch  Exception ex       ....  codepre  pI cant tell if the code in the catch block is ever called.

Negative 457 pOk, let met try to explain this in more detail. I am developing a diagnostic system for airplanes. Let imagine that airplanes has 6 to 8 onboard computers. Each computer has more than 200 different parameters. The diagnostic system receives all this parameters in binary formatted package, then I transfer data according to the formulas to km, kmh, rpm, min, sec, pascals and so on and must store it somehow in a database. The new data must be handled each 10  20 seconds and stored in persistence again. We store the data for further analytic processing.p  pstrongRequirements of storagestrongp  ul lisupport sharding and replicationli lifast read support btreeindexingli liNOSQLli lifast writeli ul  pSo, I calculated an average disk or RAM usage per one plane per day. It is about 10  20 MB of data. So an estimated load is 100 airplanes per day or 2GB of data per day.p  pIt seems that to store all the data in RAM memcachedliked storages redis, membase are not suitable too expensive. However, now I am looking to the mongodbside. Since it can utilize as RAM and disk usage, it supports all the addressed requirements.p  pPlease, share your experience and advices.p

Negative 457 pI am trying to build my first library.p  pLibraries ought to be installed in different architectures.

Negative 457 pSpecifically speaking for Windows Embedded Compact 7 with a x86 PC.p  pIn a perfect scenario, I would hope to use the common desktop application development workflow. For example, install the provided WCE7 OS from CD, bootup the OS, copy over a console application to the hard drive and execute the console application to run some simple tests  such as I would do on my Windows 7 desktop.p  pHowever, in research, I found the common workflow for developing an application on an embedded system with WCE7, includes but is not limited to, creating the OS image with platform builder, installing a boot loader on the device, connect to the device, load the custom built image and run the image from flash etc. reference a hrefhttpwww.embedded101.comBlogsSamuelPhungtabid72entryid201WindowsEmbeddedCompact7GettingStartedPart1Introduction.aspx relnofollowCompact 7 Getting Starteda by a hrefhttpwww.embedded101.comBlogsSamuelPhungtabid72authorid24SamuelPhung.aspx relnofollowSamuel Phungap  pemstrongCan the former common application workflow apply to WCE7 If yes, how If not, whyemstrongp  pI did see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9394882addcabfiletotheosdesignAdd CAB file to the OS designa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10680107howtoinstallanapplicationintothewindowsce7imageHow to install an application into the Windows CE 7 imagea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11609435howtoinstallexefileonwindowsembeddedcompact7rq1How to install .exe file on windows embedded compact 7a but not sure if their scope helps to fully answers this more general design type question.p  pIn spirit of the former, I did try to executed the installer provided on the WCE7 ISO  but this just appears to load files onto the hard drive, on a partition I made, and was unable to boot into the OS.

There is another table where the keywords are stored to filter data from Main table.p  pThe problem i am facing is that i am not able to put up the exact query which is required as the keywords which arrive in the Main Table Data are required to be filtered out.p  pFor example if there are 10 words in Keyword table then Main table data have to be searched thorough all these keywords so that it can be filtered out correctly.p  pI hope i have made the question clear.p  pAlso i am using LINQ TO SQL solution in it is most welcomep

Negative 457 pIve been trying to read data from a device via Bluetooth 2.1 using an RN42. The device pairs to an iPhone or iPad Mini, and data is streamed across briefly, but the iOS amp BT module disconnect unpair within seconds less than 10. The device is outputting data 510kBs, so well within Bluetooths spec. Something that Ive also noticed is that when I run the function NSInputStream, [NSInputStream read maxLength], the number of bytes returned is always 158 or less. The app and hardware dont crash, but the Bluetooth just unpairs.p  pThe device is still sending data to the RN42 even after the disconnect, which reduces the likelihood of a problem on the electronics side. This setup also works perfectly fine on Android devices. I can stream data without any disconnects or crashes.p  pThings Ive tried...p  ul lifollowed the External Accessory example, EADemo, provided by Apple.li lipurely using the runloop instead of polling.  li liputting the stream on a background thread as suggested in this post. li liremoving all NSLogs to help with performance.li licompiled in debug and release modes.li ul  pOne thing which sort of works is slowing down the data transfer i.e. less than 5kBs, as that allows the iOS and BT module to stay connected and transfer data longer before disconnecting.p  precodedefine EADINPUTBUFFERSIZE 1024     Stream delegate    voidstreamNSStream aStream handleEventNSStreamEventeventCode      switch eventCode  [... other cases ...]          case NSStreamEventHasBytesAvailable                                  uint8t buf[EADINPUTBUFFERSIZE]             unsigned int len  0             len  [NSInputStream aStream readbuf maxLengthEADINPUTBUFFERSIZE]              iflen                   Read successful, process data              else                   Fail                               break                  default             break           Stream delegate with polling for better or worse       [...]         case NSStreamEventHasBytesAvailable                                  while [[session inputStream] hasBytesAvailable]                               Read the data                 NSInteger bytesRead  [[session inputStream] readbuf maxLengthEADINPUTBUFFERSIZE]                  if bytesRead gt 0                       Read successful, process data                   else if bytesRead  0                       End of buffer reached                     return                   else if bytesRead  1                       Failed to read                     return                                           break     [...] codepre

Negative 457 pIn reactiveui and reactive extensions you can combine multiple observables into one. Using functions like CombineLatest or Zip you can make the resulting observable use a function to compute result based on values from combined observables. Though CombineLatest gives you an observable which gives you notifications each time any of the combined observables fires, it starts working only when all of those observables fires at least once. I want it to make notifications from the start  give combined observable an initial value, or something. Sure, I can somehow make those observable fire to set the initial values. But it is not that easy sometimes, or it makes the code look ugly. Heres an example Im making a wpf application using reactiveui. In one of my view models Im trying to create properties by combining observables. So, I have a collection ReactiveList of objects with NumberToSum property, and I need a property that will be used to display the sum of that property values. Objects in that collection are also view models and their NumberToSum property can be changed by user. Number of objects taken for sum is determined by other property. Thats how I tried to do itp  precodeprivate readonly ReactiveListltElementgt collection  new ReactiveListltElementgt private readonly ObservableAsPropertyHelperltintgt sum private int elementsToTake  0  public int ElementsToTake      get  return elementsToTake      set  this.RaiseAndSetIfChangedref elementsToTake, value    public int Sum      get  return sum.Value    public MyViewModel      var elementsToTakeObservable  this         .WhenAnyx gt x.ElementsToTake, x gt x.Value     collection.ChangeTrackingEnabled  true     here Im adding some objects to collection     var sumObservable  collection.ItemChanged         .CombineLatestelementsToTakeObservable,             , c gt collection.Takec                 .Aggregate0, i, x gt i  x.NumberToSum.         .ToPropertythis, x gt x.Sum, out sum, 0  codepre  pSo, I use ReactiveList.ItemChanged to track changes in collection items. Each time change happen the Sum is recalculated. The problem here is initial values of observables combined into sumObservable. I can easily set initial value of elementsToTakeObservable by assigning value to ElementsToTake property, which will raise property changed event and stuff. But its not so easy to do for collection.ItemChanged observable. I need to make at least one of my objects in collection raise propertychanged event, but that just look awful. Is setting these initial values possible Or maybe Im doing this entirely wrongp

Negative 457 pConsider this matrix down below, I am supposed to travel from 1 given point user input point to another user input. For example it could be ocean[1][1] to ocean[2][4]. I need to find the shortest path to the endpoint. Now, this could easily be fixed by implementing BFS. But in this case it is not that simple. Consider every point in the matrix, they each have different values.p  pI am to sail a boat from the starting point to the end point. For each point in the matrix I have different windconditions which will cause the boat to travel faster through some points and slower through others. The speed in each point, and consequently the time it takes to move through one point depends on from what direction I travel into the points. p  pThis means that I can only know the time to get through one point when actually testing it and not from the start. p  pWith this said, my objective is no longer to find the shortest path, but instead the fastest. p  pAlso there is another variable to take into consideration. I can move in 8 directions, horizontally, across and vertically North, northeast, east, southeast etc.... Moving horizontally is sqrt2 units of movement and moving the other directions  1 unit of movement.p  pSo calculating the time spent in one point you would take the direction in which you entered the point to know how many units you moved together with the speed in that point calculated from the windconditions. p  pIn order to find the fastest path I am supposed to use recursive breadth first search, this was given as an instruction. p  pI know how to write a BFS in order to find the shortest path, but I do not really know where to start in order to write recursive BFS, and how to take all my variables into consideration time etcp  pAny hints on where I could gather information for this  Also, does it sound as a logical approach to do recursive BFS for this p  pThis is an example matrix  Consider all the points with 0 on it having different values time it takes to get through that point.p  precodeocean [[0,0,0,0,0,0],           [0,0,0,0,0,0],          [0,0,0,0,0,0],          [0,0,0,0,0,0],          [0,0,0,0,0,0],          [0,0,0,0,0,0]] codepre

So I need to persist the value of channel inside the session.get callback to the value it was when the callback is called so the correct channels[channel].name is used in the session.get callback.p  pI know I have to use a closure for this but after trying a number of different approaches I cant get it working properly. Any clues to point me in the right direction Thanksp

Negative 457 pThanks. Its a small project. This is the code for the whole project. What happens within the code is that when the dropdown box is loaded the values from the ownerName in the entity class, from the dropdown when any of the member is selected then a the credit limit should be assigned by the input box on the jsp page. So no input is made for the ownerName but only the credit limit is set based on the selected ownerName from the dropdown box.

Negative 457 pI need some help with positioning my css elements in a wordpress theme.  Here is my situation.p  pFirst, I call my header.  Inside my header is my horizontal nav menu.p  pNext, I call my slider from the index.php.  The slider is created in such a way as it takes up 100 of my screen width with 0 margintop.  Doing this allows my menu to be within my slider images.p  pMy problem is that the next element I call is place directly under my menu, but I would like it placed under my slider images.  How do I do this  Do I have to give my next element a margintop equal to the height of my slider images  Seems there is probably a better way to do this.p  pThe slider is only used on the index page, not on any of the sub pages.p  pIm thinking maybe the right answer has something to do with the position tag but Im not having any luck getting the functionality to work.p  pHere is the css for my slider positioning.p  precode.slider      position absolute     top 0px     width 100     zindex 1500  codepre  pHere is my index.php filep  precodeltphp getheadergt      ltsectiongt         ltphp gettemplatepartslider, indexgt     ltsectiongt      ltsectiongt         ltdiv classrowgt             test         ltdivgt     ltsectiongt  ltphp getsidebargt ltphp getfootergt codepre  pHere is my headerp  precodeltbodygt     ltheadergt          ltsectiongt             ltdiv classrowgt                 ltnav classtopbar datatopbargt                     ltul classtitleareagt                         ltli classnamegtlth1gtlta hrefltphp echo getoption homegtgtltphp bloginfonamegtltagtlth1gtltligtltli classtoggletopbar menuicongtlta hrefgtltspangtMenultspangtltagtltligt                     ltulgt                 ltsection classtopbarsectiongt                     ltphp wpnavmenu array mainmenu gt Main Menu, container gt false, walker gt new TopBarWalker, menuclass gt rightgt                 ltsectiongt                 ltnavgt             ltdivgt         ltsectiongt      ltheadergt codepre  pAnd here is my sliderindex.php filep  precodeltdiv classrow fullwidth slidergt         ltdiv classpreloadergtltdivgt         ltul classexampleorbit dataorbit dataoptionstimerspeed 6000 slidenumber false pauseonhover false animationfadegt             ltphp             args  arraycategoryname gt Featured             query  new WPQueryargs             whilequerygthaveposts  querygtthepost             gt                 ltligtltphp thepostthumbnailfeaturedgt                 ltdiv idltphp echo getpostmetapostgtID, caption, truegt classorbitcaptiongtltphp theexcerptgtltdivgt                 ltligt             ltphp                 endwhile             gt          ltulgt          ltdiv classrow shadowgtltimg srcltphp bloginfotemplateurlgtimgbottomshadow.pnggtltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 457 pI am seeking some general insight and advise on this issue rather than a specific solution to a problem.p  pI am currently developing an application which will require an admin subdomain, for example codeadmin.mydomain.comcode and this admin subdomain will handle all things such as managing users and setting up content within the panel itself as well as API calls to Dropbox and what not.p  pGenerally, the panel will crossover somewhat with existing models and controllers from the public side of the site as well as managing its own content submitted by users who are administrators.p  pWith that being said how should I go about designing this applicationp  pGiven that my stack consists ofp  ul liNginxli liPhusion Passengerli liUbuntuli liRails 4li ul  pI havent the faintest idea whether or not 2 smaller applications are the go, because I dont know the best way to host 2 applications on the same server. Then there are things like larger memory requirements for two distinct processes, and routing issues between the two applications.p  pConversely, if this was a single application I would need to setup some funky routing to ensure that things like editing users are only available under the admin subdomain to logged in admins.p  pWith all the content read online it gives me a reasonable understanding on how to setup some things physically all though I am still not sure in that area but I am still not sure how to structure this, 2 apps or 1, best routing for a subdomain and so forth.p  pAny insight would be great, I am in quite the pickle.p

After creating a socket and codebindcodeing it to my localhost and some port Id like to use codeselectcode to know when an incoming connection arrives to the bound socket. After that the application should print the message up to a certain lenght and then codeexitcode.p  pMy question is basically if I need to use codelistencode and codeacceptcode when Im expecting only one connection please remember this is just for testing. I believe these functions are not needed in this case and are only needed for accepting multiple incoming requests. Am I wrongp  pWith the above ideia in mind I wrote the following codep  precodeint main      int fd  TCPcreateatoh127.0.0.1, 15000 my localhost address     char str  malloc100     int a     fdset rfds      FDZEROamprfds     FDSETfd,amprfds      a  selectfd1,amprfds,fdsetNULL,fdsetNULL,struct timevalNULL    printfselect returns dnfd  dn, a, fd   printffd is set sn, FDISSETfd,amprfds  yes  no      a  TCPrecvfd, str, 100 receive at most 100B     printfdn, a     printfsn, str      closefd     exit0  codepre  pTCPcreatep  precodeint TCPcreateunsigned long IP, unsigned short port      int fd     struct sockaddrin address      fd  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0     iffd1              return 1           memsetampaddress, 0, sizeofaddress     address.sinfamily  AFINET     address.sinaddr.saddr  htonlIP     address.sinport  htonsport       struct sockaddrin is the same size as struct sockaddr      ifbindfd, struct sockaddrampaddress, sizeofaddress1              return 2           return fd  codepre  pcodeatohcode simply returns its argument in host byte order.p  pWhat happens when I run the program is that codeselectcode doesnt block waiting for a connection. Instead, it immediately returns 1. If I uncomment the codeprintfcodes what I get isp  precodeselect returns 1 fd  3 is set yes 1 blank line codepre  pWhat am I missing here...p

Negative 457 pLets say I have a very simple service with a few properties on it. If I use the service in a controller, put the services properties on the scope so that they are bound to my view, and update them from the controller, they update in the view. This is the behavior Id expect. However, if the same services properties are modified from a directive outside of the controllers scope, the view is not updated unless something triggers a watch to be updated in the controllers scope. There is obviously something fundamental that Im missing here, but search search searching has not led me to the answer. p  pHere is an example on a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netSAsBa45 relnofollowJSFiddlea. p  precodeapp  angular.moduleapp, []  simple service to track applications logon status app.factoryAuthService, function       var status           isLoggedIn false           return          status status,         login function               status.isLoggedIn  true             console.loguser logged in         ,         loggedIn function               return status.isLoggedIn         ,         logout function               status.isLoggedIn  false             console.loguser logged out                 app.controllerAuthViewCtrl, function scope, AuthService       bind some service attributes, functions to the scope so that we can use them in our view     scope.loggedIn  AuthService.loggedIn     scope.login  AuthService.login     scope.logout  AuthService.logout     scope.stat  AuthService.status    a simple directive to allow elements to log out of the app on click app.directiveappLogout, function AuthService      return function scope, element          element.bindclick, function               AuthService.logout                  a simple directive to allow elements to log into the app on click app.directiveappLogin, function AuthService      return function scope, element          element.bindclick, function               AuthService.login                codepre  pAnd the accompanying htmlp  precodeltdiv ngappappgt     ltdiv ngcontrollerAuthViewCtrlgt         ltstronggtAre we logged inltstronggt         ltulgt             ltligtservice func on scope ltstronggt loggedIn ltstronggtltligt             ltligtservice prop on scope ltstronggt stat.isLoggedIn ltstronggtltligt         ltulgt          ltbutton ngclicklogingtlog in from controller scopeltbuttongt         ltbutton ngclicklogoutgtlog out from controller scopeltbuttongt         ltbutton ngclickloggedIngtcall AuthService.loggedInltbuttongt     ltdivgt      ltbutton applogingtlog in from directiveltbuttongt     ltbutton applogoutgtlog out from directiveltbuttongt ltdivgt codepre  pThe app is logged out when you start.

Negative 457 pWhat is the proper way to wait for the result of multiple actors in Akkap  pThe a hrefhttpswww.coursera.orgcoursereactive relnofollowPrinciples of Reactive Programminga Coursera course had an exercise with a replicated keyvalue store. Without going into the details of the assignment, it required waiting on the acknowledgement of multiple actors before it could indicate the replication was complete. p  pI implemented the assignment using a mutable map containing the outstanding requests, but I felt the solution had a bad smell. I hoped there was a better way to implement what seems like a common scenario. p  pIn an attempt to uphold the classes honor code by withholding my solution to the exercise, I have an abstract use case that describes a similar problem.p  pAn invoice line item needs to calculate its tax liability. The tax liability is combination of all the taxes applied to the line item across multiple taxing authorities e.g., federal, state, police district. If each taxing authority was an actor capable of determining the tax liability of the line item, the line item would need all actors to report before it could continue report the overall tax liability. What is the bestright way to accomplish this scenario in Akkap

These services are implemented as diverse stateless and stateful beans with dependencies between them. p  pThe application has a parentchild structure of application contexts in place, so each web app has its own context. An approximate idea is as followsp  precodedao   services         oneappcontext                oneservletcontext                    twoappcontext                twoservletcontext codepre  pTo build this, I have followed instructions given inp  pa hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs3.2.xjavadocapiorgspringframeworkbeansfactoryaccessSingletonBeanFactoryLocator.html relnofollowhttpdocs.spring.iospringdocs3.2.xjavadocapiorgspringframeworkbeansfactoryaccessSingletonBeanFactoryLocator.htmlap  pIm using XML config  annotation based bean scanning, with default shared singleton bean scope instantiation. There is a global properties file and each web app has its own properties files with new properties or variations on global properties  e.g. different values or strings. Also, all dependencies to services are made through interfaces.p  pMy problem is that Im forced to initialize a concrete implementation for each service to satisfy autowiring requirements when starting the shared context  but for a given web app, Id like to use a different implementation or a new instance with different settings. p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pPrasad gave me a good practical reply  however I should have added the case where both controllers use the same implementation of a stateful service, but these are initialized with different settingsvalues  known only to each web layer package.  Id like to see a solution if possible where I use annotationsscanning and dont need to make instantiation acrobatics to get the right wiring  profiles perhaps p  pIn the end, dependencies would look somehow like thisp  precodeonewebcontroller gt serviceAimpl1                    gt serviceBimpl gt serviceDimpl with one.properties                    gt serviceCimpl                    gt serviceEimpl with one.properties  twowebcontroller gt serviceAimpl2                    gt serviceBimpl gt serviceDimpl with two.properties                    gt serviceEimpl with two.properties codepre  pKeeping KISS in mind, how can I effectively setup Spring MVC so that each web app has its choice of custom service instances or implementations or plugins, whatever you prefer but at the same time maximize reusep  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 457 pIm new to Python, so Im sorry if what Im asking is dumbp  pI have a piece of code which can be used by mutliple threads in Python. There is a section of it which needs to be locked so only one thread can process it at a time.p  pTypically I would do this with a semaphore. The problem I have in this particular scenario is that I dont have access to the code which initiates the threads where I could define the semaphore so that all threads have access to it.p  pI thought if I made the semaphore a class variable, it would only create one instance of the variable which would be shared by all instances of the class as followsp  precodeclass SubscriptionDetails     sema  Semaphore1       def initself        ...        print sema stridSubscriptionDetails.sema       def addtoglobalself        SubscriptionDetails.sema.acquire        ...        SubscriptionDetails.sema.release codepre  pBut when I look in the logs, I can see the address printed out for sema as part of the stronginitstrong method in the class is different each time. I can also see overlapping threads running the same part of the code that was supposedly locked.p  pIs there a way around this with only access to the code that is used by the child threadsp

Negative 457 pusually I can figure out a way to make Knockoutjs do what I want.  In this case however, im struggling a little, so Im opening the question up to the community here on SO.p  h2Introductionh2  pIm writing an HTML5 web app using typescript, bootstrap, knockoutjs and a nodejs backend.p  pIn my UI which is all controlled via knockoutJS I have a set of buttons, formed as a bootstrap 3 button group of selectable options.p  pThis justified group, gives me 4 buttons horizontally, but allows the behaviour of the button selections to remain consistant with a group of option buttons.p  pThat consistancy is important, beacuse ONLY one button at a time can ever be selected, so when one is clicked, the rest deselect.p  pThis is a default component in BS3, as the following image showsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKpB3M.png altBS3 button groupp  pAs you can see in the image, the Discarded button is selected, to achieve this a class of active must be added to the existing class list of the label element surrounding the inner radio element that makes up the control.  The following HTML is used to create this imagep  precodeltdiv classbtngroup btngroupjustified datatogglebuttonsgt   ltlabel classbtn btnprimarygt     ltinput typeradio nameoptions idoption1 checked gtRejected   ltlabelgt   ltlabel classbtn btnprimary activegt     ltinput typeradio nameoptions idoption2gtDiscarded   ltlabelgt   ltlabel classbtn btnprimarygt     ltinput typeradio nameoptions idoption3gtHeld   ltlabelgt   ltlabel classbtn btnprimarygt     ltinput typeradio nameoptions idoption3gtHeader Added   ltlabelgt ltdivgt codepre  pAll this works great except for one small flaw, Im using knockout JS to manage the UI.p  h2The Problem Im Trying to Solveh2  pThe checked state of each of the options is tied to a property inside the view model applied to the HTML, so the inner option on the rejected button for example has a normal knockoutjs checked binding added to it as followsp  precodeltinput typeradio nameoptions idoption1 checked databindchecked rejectgtRejected codepre  pEach of the options, each have their own backing fieldp  precodereject discard hold addheader codepre  pand each of those backing fields are a standard boolean value holding truefalse, what I cant figure out is how to addremove the active class on the enclosing label, to reflect which of these states has been selected.p  pTo be more precise, I cant figure out the best way to do it elegantly.p  h2Approaches Ive triedh2  pwhat I know works is to add a simple computed observable to each label that returns p  precodebtn btnprimary active codepre  pwhen that option is set to true, andp  precodebtn btnprimary codepre  pwhen it is not.p  pI know this, because in my view model, I had a simple functionp  precodeSenderDialogViewModel.prototype.isRejectSelected  function           if this.reject  true              return btn btnprimary active                  return btn btnprimary      codepre  pHowever, this approach means 4 functions, one for each flag to test, making it difficult to add new flags at a later date.p  pWhat Id like to be able to do, is something like the followingp  precodeltlabel classbtn btnprimary databindclass isSelectedrejectgt codepre  pas an example.p  pWhich I almost got to work with a slight modification to the abovep  precodeSenderDialogViewModel.prototype.isSelected  function selectionVariable          if selectionVariable  true              return active                  return       codepre  pWhere selection variable could be any of the flags available in the view model, passed in.p  pThe problem here was, that this ONLY updated the first time the UI was drawn, subsequent changes to the flags, failed to update the UI to reflect the given status.p  pTo try and resolve this, I changed the function to a computed observable, only to then receive a JS error when the UI was drawn, stating that the computed observable had to have a write handler added to it, because I was passing a parameter in.p  pIf I need to add a write handler, then thats fine, but Id rather not.p  h2Summaryh2  pSo in summary, there are ways of changing the class list in sync with other options, but most of them are messy, what Im trying to do is create a way thats easily expanded as new buttons are added This is important as some button sets are dynamically generated, rather than adding a handler to individually check and report the status on each and every variable there, in one function call that can be added simply into the viewmodel and reused again and again.p

Negative 457 pI am not very good at data structures, so this might be very silly question. I am looking for a way to implement a hybrid behavior of queue  maps. p  pI am currently using codetbbconcurrentboundedqueuecode documented at a hrefhttpssoftware.intel.comenusnode506201 relnofollowIntels developer zonea from a hrefhttpwww.threadingbuildingblocks.org relnofollowwww.threadingbuildingblocks.orga in a multithreaded single producer single consumer process. The queue has market data quote objects and the producer side of the process is actually highly time sensitive, so what I need is a queue that is keyed on a market data identifier such as USDCAD, EURUSD. The Value points through codeuniqueptrcode to most latest market data quote that I received for this key. p  pSo, let us say my queue has 5 elements for 5 unique identifiers and suddenly we get updated market data quote for the identifier at 3rd position in the queue, then I just store the most latest value and discard the value I previously had. So, essentially I just move my uniqueptr to the new market data quote for this key. p  pIts like it is similar to codeconcurrentboundedqueueltpairltstring, uniqueptrltQuotegtgtgtcode but is keyed on the first element of the pair. p  pI am not sure if this is already available in a thirdparty library may be tbb itself or what it is called if it is a standard data structure.p  pI would highly appreciate any help or guidance on this.p  pThanks.p

Negative 457 pMy web host one.com has a preset PHP memory limit of 128 MB, and they say it cannot be upgraded. I use a PHP script to collect data and store it in a SQLite db on the server NB file db, not memory .p  pWhen the database reaches 128mb, it stops the php script running. I have had to clear the database back to scratch to get it going again. At first I dismissed it as a glitch but then it happened at 128mb again lesson to be learned about dismissing things you cant explain...p  pI cant work out why a memory limit is affected by the SQLite db file size. The script accesses the SQLite db through the PDO abstraction layer. I could change it to use the SQLite3 specific database extension, but thatd be without verifying what the issue was first. And as such theres no way to know if it would help.p  pBefore I delve deeper, is anyone aware of what could cause such an odd situation, am I completely missing something obviousp

Negative 457 pI often use library functions like codeFile.Existscode to check for a files existence before opening it or doing some other action.  While I have had good luck with this in practice over the years, I wonder if it is a poorly thoughtout pattern. p  pAny IO call like a file system read can fail for multiple reasons. The path string could be wrong or the file actually not exist, you could lack permissions, someone else might have a lock that blocks you. You could even have another process or another user on the network move a file in the millisecond between your codeFile.Existscode and your codeOpencode.p  pEven if you get a successful result from codeFile.Existscode, you still really should enclose your actual open statements in a try block to handle one of the other possible failure modes.  If I am thinking about this correctly, codeFile.Existscode just lulls you into a false sense of safety if you use it instead of codeTrycode as I am sure that I have on occasion in the past.p  pAll of this makes it sound like I should abandon codeFile.Existscode and change whatever existing code I find to use the Try...Catch pattern only.  Is this a sensible conclusion I realize that the framework authors but it there for us to use, but that does not automatically make it a good tool in practice.p

Negative 457 pI am pretty new to grails. I have a pre existing application I want to run. The application builds and runs correctly but I am unable to figure out the server it is using  whether the default VMware or Tomcat instance p I included the tomcat plugin in my codeBuildConfig.groovycode as shown below p  pcodebuild tomcat7.0.52.1codep  pI am assuming that the application is infact running on a tomcat server but I know no way of confirming it. On the servers tab of my GGTS, I see only a VMware instance but no Tomcat instance. Is this normalp  pI also tried to check the logs while the application is deployed by changing the log level to codeverbosecode in the codeBuildConfig.groovycode, but that too doesnt give me enough information to get the answer which is where my search ended.p  pFor those interested, my main aim is to configure SSL certificate on tomcat if it already isnt done. Any help regarding this is very much appreciated. p
Negative 457 pIm using VLCJ for audio streaming between a server and a client.

By using codeSystem.out.printlnmediaPlayer.mrlcode it shows that it is opening codefilehomeuserworkspaceaudioProjecthttp3A127.0.0.13A5555code instead of the MRL directly from the HTTP address codehttp127.0.0.15555code.p  pa hrefhttpvlcj.googlecode.comsvnwikiStreaming.wiki relnofollowHerea, it shows an example of how the client opens a stream.p  pAny guesses about what Im doing wrong And a workaround to itp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 457 pThis is my first time using jQuery AJAX so bear with me. I am trying to create a like button for my website similar to the Facebook like button. A user must be logged on via Facebook which will pull their userid from my database. When a user clicks on the like button, it inserts a row into the database with the user info and the page info. If there is already an entry for the user and page, it will update the row.p  pMy code runs perfectly fine on my localhost. I can click on the like button all day and the image will constantly change back and forth from like to unlike and back. The database updates every time as well with no problem.p  pWhen I upload this to my live server, the script runs perfectly fine as well to a point. Once my page finishes loading completely, the database no longer updates from the click. The images will change as usual and I will receive the alertSuccess but no changes are made to the actual database.p  precodeltphp tempstat  1 if stmt  mysqli gt prepareSELECT countid     FROM votes     WHERE businessid and status       stmt gt bindparamss, businessid, tempstat     stmt gt execute     stmtgtbindresultlikecount     stmtgtfetch     stmtgtclose  if likecount    likecount  0  gt ltstylegt karmabar  paddingleft 4px  counter  margin 0 auto textalign center width 50px height 25px backgroundimage urlimageskarmacounter.png  pcounter  fontsize 12px paddingtop 5px  .karma  margin 0 auto fontsize 16px color blue textalign center padding 5px  ltstylegt ltphp iflogincheckmysqli  true   userid  SESSION[userurl]  if stmt  mysqli gt prepareSELECT status     FROM votes     WHERE userid and businessid       stmt gt bindparamss, userid, businessid     stmt gt execute     stmt gt bindresultlikestatus     stmtgtfetch     stmtgtclose  if likestatus   or likestatus  NULL  likestatus  0  gt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   document.readyfunction      likepost.clickfunction        .ajax         url includeslike.php,         type GET,         data useridltphp echo userid gtampbusinessidltphp echo businessid gtamplikestatus1,         success function              alertSuccess         ,         error function             alertSomething went wrong                       counter.htmlfunctioni, val  return val11        likepost.hide       unlikepost.show         unlikepost.clickfunction       .ajax         url includeslike.php,         type GET,         data useridltphp echo userid gtampbusinessidltphp echo businessid gtamplikestatus0,         success function              alertSuccess         ,         error function              alertSomething went wrong                         counter.htmlfunctioni, val  return val11        unlikepost.hide       likepost.show     ltscriptgt ltdiv idkarmabargt     lttable cellpadding0pxgt         ltphp if likestatus  0  gt         lttrgtlttdgtlta hrefjavascript idunlikepost classhidegtltimg srcimageskarmaactive.png titleUndo Karma gtltagtlta hrefjavascript idlikepostgtltimg srcimageskarmainactive.png titleSpread Karma gtltagtlttdgtltp idcountergtltphp echo likecount gtltpgtlttdgtlttrgt         ltphp  else  gt         lttrgtlttdgtlta hrefjavascript idunlikepostgtltimg srcimageskarmaactive.png titleUndo Karma gtltagtlta hrefjavascript idlikepost classhidegtltimg srcimageskarmainactive.png titleSpread Karma gtltagtlttdgtlttdgtltp idcountergtltphp echo likecount gtltpgtlttdgtlttrgt         ltphp  gt     lttablegt ltdivgt ltphp  else  gt ltdiv idkarmabargt     lttable cellpadding0pxgt         lttrgtlttdgtlta href onclickalertLogin with Facebook to Spread Karma gtltimg srcimageskarmainactive.png titleSpread Karma gtltagtlttdgtltp idcountergtltphp echo likecount gtltpgtlttdgtlttrgt     lttablegt ltdivgt codepre    pbusinessid and userid are both defined higher up on the page.p  plike.phpp  precodeltphp includeonce SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT].includesdbconnect.php includeonce SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT].includesfunctions.php userid  GET[userid] businessid  GET[businessid] IP  mysqligtrealescapestringgetClientIP likestatus  GET[likestatus] if stmt  mysqli gt prepareSELECT countid     FROM votes     WHERE userid and businessid           stmt gt bindparamss, userid, businessid         stmt gt execute         stmt gtbindresultcount         stmt gtfetch         stmt gtclose  if count  1      if stmt  mysqli gt prepareUPDATE votes      SET ip, status     WHERE userid and businessid           stmt gt bindparamssss, IP, likestatus, userid, businessid         stmt gt execute         stmt gt close         mysqli gt close       if count  0      if stmt  mysqli gt prepareINSERT INTO votes userid, businessid, ip, status      VALUES  , , ,             stmt gt bindparamssss, userid, businessid, IP, likestatus          stmt gt execute         stmt gt close         mysqli gt close       gt codepre  pI appreciate any help that you guys can give me.

Negative 457 pI have a GUI application which Ive written in PyQT. When the user clicks a button theres a call made to a certain sites API and information is retrieved and shown in a QTableWidget. Processing the information and displaying it shouldnt take more than a second. Im finding that the application is taking up to 15 seconds to display the information, but when I check the CPU time of the Python process via Activity Monitor, that 15 seconds of time only translates to lt1s of CPU time which leads me to believe its a scheduling problem. Id prefer to leave actual code out, because I dont emthinkem its a code problem.p  pIn a terrible attempt to debug it, I threw codeprint time.timecode between almost every other line. What I found is that there is no consistency as to where the slow down occurs which is another reason Im led to believe its a scheduling problem. For example, I found that a line that only contained codefor artist in result.artistscode took 0.2 seconds to process. coderesult.artistscode was a list of size 2 in that particular case. There were slowdowns of similar length 0.2 seconds on similar trivial statements throughout the rest of the code.p  pIve tried setting the thread priority via QT methods, i.e. codemyapp.thread.setPriorityQtCore.QThread.TimeCriticalPrioritycode with no luck. My last option is to recode it in C, but Id really like to avoid that if I can find some kind of work around. Ive also considered that it could be caused in part by how old my computer is Macbook Pro, early 2008 model, 2.4 GHz dualcore, and if I had a newer processor with more cores the Python process might get scheduled more often. Does that make sensep  pThanks in advance for any suggestions.p
Negative 457 pI have a relatively simple Cclass that I would like to marshal into a VB project.

I compile this and create a type library to be used by VB6.  Everything work well in terms of data getting passed from the simple types, but the Messages variable, while the VB runtime recognizes it as an ArrayList, does not contain any data in it even when it should.  What am I missing, in terms of marshaling the data  I know that generics do not marshal, but I believe an ArrayList does.  Am I missing an attribute, or something elsep  pNo need to offer alternative solutions, as I am asking this because I want to know how to do it, not because I dont have alternatives if I can get this to work.

Negative 457 pSo hours later I am still stuck on this, what I think should be simple thing.p  pWhat I need to do is the followingp  ol lipHave the user select the round from a drop down box. This is implemented and seems to be ok.pli lipBased on that roundID that is selected from the dropdown box, there is a group of 9 Radio Button Lists that have home, draw, away in them. The user needs to select one of these options for each game so 9x3 choices in total. pli lipThis is the part that I am stuck on. When the user selects the round, the items in the Radio Button List need to dynamically change so that the home and away teams are placed inside the radio list selection automatically, this information is drawn from a database with each round and the 18 games per round already in it. This needs to be shown like this Home name of team variable, Away name of team variable etc etc Ive tried things like Homelthome1 etc but it seems that I cant do that...pli ol  pAny thoughts on thisp

Negative 457 pDue to a combination of business needs and old habits, our QABA team members seem to think they need an ability to seemingly cherrypick any combination of development work for a potential release candidate at release time. This worries me because at the moment this is leaving a lot of the git scar tissue in terms of revert and revert revert commits and comment out and uncomment commits which are sometimes worse. Sadfaced aside In darcs this would be a bit more easily attainable with the given tools, but of course we arent using darcs we are using git. In doing some research yesterday I came across the a hrefhttpsgithub.comaffinitybridgegitbpfwikiBranchperfeatureprocess relnofollowBranch per featurea BPF workflow automation efforts and their processes for maintaining total isolation, total integration TITI. Now Im trying to figure out if I can implement something similar in our work environment, hopefully without adding too much additional development process work and without throwing out the baby with the bath water to do so. Not to mention the other questions of how I could potentially surface some automation to our QABA structure...p  pThe TITI process in BPF relies heavily on a shared git rerere cache so that integration merges can be done in throwaway branches or in the integration branch, but be reusable for the cherry picking process when building release candidate QA branches. The particular point here is not to merge into the source branch to keep the source branch totally isolated. So Im trying to figure out how that could work in a workflow where we are using GitHub PRs as the integration merge. Clearly a PR does not currently allow complicated merges and the current workflow is fix merge conflicts in the source branch, but that would violate the isolation principle if we were to try BPF. Theoretically we could do the throwaway merge technique, but how do you setup GitHub to share the rerere cachep  pstrongTLDRstrong What would be the best way to handle shared rerere emandem continue to use GitHubs Pull Requests, possibly still as the unit of integrationonly required integration mergep  pHacky Aside Currently we only need to do this on one of our repositories and that repository is currently hosted on premises in GitHub for Enterprises, so there exists a small possibility that I could convince an admin with SSH access to hack the git config on the machine for that repository to turn on the shared rerere and autorerere. However there is a lot of frailty on relying on such a hack, including potential questions from other business units why they cant do what we are doing on public GitHub and also just the issues of potential GitHub updates breaking any git config hacks, presuming that they even work in the first place...p
Negative 457 pIm trying to fix C async code launching a cancelable operation performed in an external dll written in unmanaged C routine.p  pIs there a way to cancel a Task using a Cancellation Token passed to the Task at creation, if the user delegate calls an external non managed C routine p  pAs far I know, Task cancellation involves cooperation between the user delegate and the code that requested the cancellation. A successful cancellation involves the requesting code calling the CancellationTokenSource.Cancel method, and the user delegate terminating the operation in a timely manner either by simply returning from the delegate when he notices that the a cancellation request has been raised by polling the CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested method or by throwing an OperationCanceledException using CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested method. cf a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd99739628vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd99739628vvs.11029.aspxap  pThese two ways involve that the non managed C routine executed by the user delegate cooperates by receiving the CancellationToken as a parameter and by calling at regular intervals its IsCancellationRequested andor ThrowIfCancellationRequested methods.p  pIs that possible to do that from a non managed external C routine p  pIf not, is there a way to force the termination of the task executing the user delegate executing the non managed c routine when the cancellation is requested by the requesting code p  pHere is an example extract of the mixed C  CCli  Unmanaged C code Im trying to fix in order to be able to cancel the operation performed by the user delegate in the C unmanaged code part   p  pFrmDemo.csp  precodepublic class FrmDemo  Form      private CliClass mCliObject     private System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource mCts     private System.Threading.CancellationToken mCt      private void FrmDemoLoadobject sender, EventArgs e               Creating the external CliObject         this.mCliObject  new NSDemo.CliClass         ...

Negative 457 pI have an sqlite database where I need to insert spatial information along with metadata into an Rtree and an accompanying regular table. Each entry needs to be uniquely defined for the lifetime of the database.

Alas this doesnt seem possiblep  precodegttestCon lt dbConnectRSQLiteSQLite, memory gtdbGetQuerytestCon, CREATE TABLE testTable x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y INTEGER gtdbGetQuerytestCon, INSERT INTO testTable y VALUES y, bind.datadata.framey15 gtdbGetQuerytestCon, SELECT lastinsertrowid FROM testTable    lastinsertrowid 1                   5 2                   5 3                   5 4                   5 5                   5 codepre  pOnly the last inserted rowid seems to be kept probably for performance reasons.

Negative 457 pI have an existing app that was created and designed for the iPhone 5s. I am working towards an update for the iPhone 6 Plus and I have the new resolution and layouts working thats all well and good. I have a codeUIViewControllercode which contains some text fields, a codeUIDatePickercode and a codeUISegmentControlcode. p  pI have built up the codeUIViewControllercode using codeAutoLayoutcode in Xcode 6 and so with that in mind, it adjusts itself for the different screen sizes iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. p  pOn the iPhone 5s, the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 6, the codeUIDatePickercode is perfectly workable. On the iPhone 6 Plus however, its unresponsive where users would expect to select dates and instead the user has to select areas strongoutsidestrong of the codeUIDatePickercode to change dates. For example, to change the date, the user has to select to the left of the date for it to move and the same goes for the year  placing your finger on the year doesnt make it move, but moving your finger to the right of it, does. p  pIt looks like the area is being stretched out and therefore not accurately representing the area of the codeUIDatePickercode. p  pHeres the codeUIViewControllercodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrMI6w.png altenter image description herep  pHere are the codeAutoLayoutcode constraintsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRZsZn.png altenter image description herep  pAny thoughts on this would be really appreciated. p

Negative 457 pI was considering using the Python PyPI package codepyinotifycode, but got concerned when I saw this post   a hrefhttpwww.serpentine.comblog20080104whyyoushouldnotusepyinotify relnofollowWhy you should not use pyinotifyap  pThis post is from 012008, and pyinotify has been actively maintained since then up through the last commit on 8162014 [a hrefhttpsgithub.comsebmpyinotify relnofollowgithub repositorya] at the time of this post, and the last PyPI version uploaded on 20121115, so Im wondering if these issues have been resolved  The issues from the post arep  ol liA program using pyinotify can easily lose track of parts of its directory hierarchy. The library doesnt raise an OSError exception if the inotifyaddwatch system call fails instead, it propagates the 1 error result up to the caller as a value in a dict, but without the value of errno to tell the caller why the error occurred.  Its thus trivial to miss errors entirely, because the usual mechanism of raising exceptions isnt used.li liAlmost as bad, its impossible to distinguish between recoverable tried to add a watch on a directory that no longer exists and fatal hit the system maxuserwatches limit errors.li liUnder the hood, though, the implementation is terrible. On every event, the library scans every event that the inotify interface could possibly report, and checks to see if your class implements one of several possible appropriately named methods. This means its traversing a 20element dict, and performing up to 60 attribute lookups of which up to 40 are based on formatted names, for every reported event.br This has disastrous performance implications. If you write a simple monitoring tool that uses pyinotify, use it to monitor activity in a Linux kernel source tree, and then start a build in that tree, try running top while your build runs. When I did this, I found that pyinotify was consuming an entire CPU trying to keep up with the flood of notification events.li liAll that needless attribute lookup churn isnt the only problem pyinotify uses a threading.RLock to protect every access to every attribute of its Watch class, by providing its own codegetattributecode and codesetattrcode methods.br I cant guess what the author thinks hes protecting himself from, but hes got a solid defence mounted against both correctness and performance there. Blindly locking individual attributes isnt going to protect the consistency of an entire data structure, and delegating responsibility for locking out to callers, who are probably all singlethreaded anyway, might help to recover a bit of the execrable performance. Watch isnt often on the fast path, thank goodness.li ol  pNotes  p  ul liBryan OSullivan, the author of that post, wrote pythoninotify to resolve those issues a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgbospythoninotify relnofolloworiginal bitbucket repository by Bryan OSullivana a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypipythoninotify relnofollowPyPI pagea a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgJanKanispythoninotify relnofollownew repo by Jan Kanisa .

Negative 457 pWe have a functioning program that uses codeTkintercode as its GUI.

Negative 457 pFor my project I am building a QA program in exce to check the data of one sheet against the data of another sheet. The problem here is that one of the sheets is extracted from a database so the formatting and the location of everything is different then in the file I will be checking it against. Another caveat is that this program has to work across multiple workbooks.p  pMy first attempt at this problem was to make sure data in both sheets was sorted similarly. This made it so that all of the data is alphabetically sorted on both sides by the lowest possible matching criteria. I then in turn created a new sheets with basic if statements to then check the data in the appropriate rows.p  pThe problem herein lies with missing data. My current code when dragged down accurately identifies if the data in the corresponding table is correct but doesnt account for if an entire row is missing. It will return a fail for that row then every row below it which is unacceptable for the goal I am trying to accomplish. Also I feel as if the program is hardcoded excessively which leaves me open for problems down the road, if I send this program to lower level employees to run QA they wont know to change references in the program to get the correct answers.p  pSo basically what I am asking is how would you code this so that if an error arose by a row missing it wouldnt destroy the rest of the QA and make it useless but instead recognize that that row is gone return a fail for that row and the corresponding data and move on. p  pHere is my code very macro recorded heavy, as I am a very new VBAer. p  precodeThis section returns the heading of the row I am taking the data from     SheetsRatings QA.Select ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1  Sheet1RC[8] This section returns title headings of each row to ensure they match with title headings from the master RangeA2.Select ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1       IFDetailed RatingsR[15]C[8]Sheet1RC[8],Sheet1RC[8],Fail RangeA2.Select Selection.AutoFill DestinationRangeA2A400, TypexlFillDefault RangeB1.FormulaR1C1  Sheet1RC[8] RangeB1.Select Selection.AutoFill DestinationRangeB1BI1, TypexlFillDefault RangeB2.Select ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1       IFDetailed RatingsR[15]C[8]Sheet1RC[8],Pass,Fail RangeB2.Select Selection.AutoFill DestinationRangeB2B400, TypexlFillDefault RangeB2B400.Select Selection.AutoFill DestinationRangeB2BI400, TypexlFillDefault RangeB2BI400.Select    Cells.Select Selection.FormatConditions.Add TypexlCellValue, OperatorxlEqual,      Formula1Pass Selection.FormatConditionsSelection.FormatConditions.Count.SetFirstPriority With Selection.FormatConditions1.Font     .Bold  True End With With Selection.FormatConditions1.Interior     .PatternColorIndex  xlAutomatic     .Color  5287936 End With Selection.FormatConditions1.StopIfTrue  False Selection.FormatConditions.Add TypexlCellValue, OperatorxlEqual,      Formula1Fail Selection.FormatConditionsSelection.FormatConditions.Count.SetFirstPriority With Selection.FormatConditions1.Font     .Bold  True End With With Selection.FormatConditions1.Interior     .PatternColorIndex  xlAutomatic     .Color  255 End With Selection.FormatConditions1.StopIfTrue  False     With ActiveWindow     .SplitColumn  0     .SplitRow  1 End With codepre  pOne proposed solution that I thought might work but I am unsure how to code would be that if a fail was returned in the first row where title heading should be, would be to include a placeholder row. So instead of just putting fail it would fill that row with fail then skip that range of cells then the following row would continue down the range as if nothing had happened. It would return error and not destroy the QA any ideas as how I can add this as a condition of the if statement.p  pThank you,p

Here is what my sample looks like.p  precodelttable idcategorytablegt     lttbodygt         lttrgt             lttd idtitlecell1gt                 lta href idtitle1gtTitle 1ltagt             ltdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd idimagecell1gt                 lta href idimage1gtltimg srcimage.jpg gtltagt             ltdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd idtitlecell2gt                 lta href idtitle2gtTitle 1ltagt             ltdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd idimagecell2gt                 lta href idimage2gtltimg srcimage.jpg gtltagt             ltdgt         lttrgt     lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pI would like to take the title, the image and their surrounding A tags and plug them into a div to make something like thisp  precodeltdiv idcategoriesgt     ltdiv idcategorydiv1gt         lth1gtlta href idnewtitle1gtTitleltagtlth1gt         lta href idnewimage1gtltimg srcimage.jpg gtltagt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idcategorydiv2gt         lth1gtlta href idnewtitle2gtTitleltagtlth1gt         lta href idnewimage2gtltimg srcimage.jpg gtltagt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThis is obviously just an example of two items, but this page will have around 16 of them, so this script would obviously need to incrementally add the equivalent of all the cells into new divs.p  pI have seen different jquery solutions, by using the clone, replaceWith and replaceAll method, for example. But its all been replacing one item with another.  I would like to replace all of them in their own respective divs.  I dont know if a souped up version of one of those methods is best, or if some sort of index system would work better. Im just starting to learn javascript, so trying to put my head around this is overwhelming.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 457 pHas anyone out in the community successfully created a Selenium build in Jenkins using Browserstack as their cloud provider, while requiring a local testing connection behind a firewallp  pI can say for sure Saucelabs is surprisingly easy to execute builds with the Sauce Jenkins plugin in a continuous deployment environment as I have done it. I cannot however, say the same for Browserstack. The organization I work with currently uses Browserstack, and although their service does support automated testing using a binary application I find it troublesome with Jenkins. I need to make absolutely sure Browserstack is not a viable solution, if so. I love Saucelabs and what their organization provides, but if Browserstack works I dont want to switch if I dont need to.p  pThe Browserstack documentation instructs you to run a command, with some available options, in order to create a local connection before execution.p  precodenohup .[binary file] localIdentifier [id] [auth key] localhost,3000,0 amp codepre  pI have added the above statement as a prebuild step shell command.

Subsequent build configurations using the same command never connect. The above message displays, but during test execution Browserstack reports no local testing connection was established. This confuses me.p  pTo give you a better idea of whats being executed, I have 15 build configurations for various projects suites and browser combinations. Two Jenkins executors exist and I have more than 5 Browserstack VMs available at any given time. Five of the builds will automatically begin execution when the associated project code is pushed to the staging server, filling up both executors. One of them will begins and end fine. None of the others will as Browserstack reports local testing is not available.p  pSaucelabs obviously has this figured out with their plugin, which is great. If Browserstack requires shell commands to create local testing connections, I must be doing something wrong, out of order, etc.p  pEnvironmentp  ul liJava 7li liSelenium 2.45li liJUnit 4.11li liMaven 3.1.1li liAllure 1.4.10li liJenkins 1.5li ul  pCan someone post some information who use Browserstack in a continuous testing environment while utilizing multiple parallel test executions and tell me how each build is configuredp  pThanks,p

Negative 457 pI am working with a 3rd party web service which is written in JavaAxis.  I have not worked much with WCF so I am trying to feel my way through this.  I was able to generate the class from the wsdl and using Fiddler I am able to see the call being made to the service, and a response being returned.  But in my code, my response is empty and I am not sure why I am not seeing the response.  I did read one post about the namespace, and tried to update it, but no luck.  Below is the generated class, the wsdl and the response from the web service.  Is there an issue with the auto generated class  Why is my response not being consumed by the C codep  pThis is the generated class.

So maybe the entire use of generics like this is just plain wrong. I think this answers question 1 codey.plus...code returns codeRealNumbercode because y is raw, so Java type system just doesnt care anymore that codeScode extends codeIntNumbercode. However, I want to avoid repeating the codepluscode method in all subclasses of RealNumber, and I should be able to use generics, in some way, to avoid that. So question 2 still stands. What should I be doingp  pNote My actual classes are not Reals and Integers, but some other complicated business classes. Think of them as classes A, B, C and dont question the model. They are addables, yes, but here X.plusY should return type X, for every X and Y.p

Negative 457 pOkay, Im really new to programming just learned how to make database connections and writeread from it today and Im trying to make a basic site that allows you to log a user in, and have some sort of page that is different when a user is logged in. Ive decided to take a stab using Flask, Flasksession, Sqlite3, basically authentication is as follows user logins in using form, form data is checked against the information in sqlite3 database then if it is correct the corresponding values are written to the CLIENT side cookie. Is this an acceptable way of logging someone in Forgive my ignorance, but really new to programming and Im missing some key terminology to search for my own answers here.

firstclass variables is not very nice. The way I have implemented it is as followsp  ol liEvery variable has a codetermcode property which is codenullcode initially to show that the variable has not yet been instantiated.li liWhen a variable is unified with a nonvariable its codetermcode property is set to the nonvariable, which is fine.li liHowever, when a variable is unified with another variable then a problem arises. We cant set the codetermcode property of one variable to the other because that would result in a cyclic reference. Therefore, I create a new variable and set both codetermcode properties of both the variables to the new variable.li liThis causes another problem. If we unify lots of variables then the codetermcode chain will become longer which is why I need the coderesolvecode function in my code above. It traverses the codetermcode chain and returns the last term in the chain.li ol  pSo my question is whether there is a better way to create firstclass variables in JavaScript i.e. one in which sharing values between two variables doesnt require the use of a codetermcode chain. If there is a better way then please describe the algorithm.p
Negative 457 pI asked a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29379228combinemultiplemysqlqueriesonthesametableintooneCombine Multiple MySQL Queries on the Same Table Into Onea and received a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma29381060804104noteworthy answera thanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers4632864paulgriffincodePaul Griffincodea.p  pAs stated in my other question linked above, I have multiple queries combined into one query. These queries consist of exact matching and broad matching search terms. p  pI am searching through posts on a WordPress website. Just to keep things simple, Im looking through the following columns in the posts table codeposttitlecode Article Title, codepostnamecode Article URL Slug, and codepostexcerptcode Article Summary.p  pJust to keep things even simpler for the sake of this question, lets say I have a search term of Floor Finish, and Im only searching through the column codeposttitlecode. p  pAs stated earlier, Im looking for exact matches and broad matches.p  pstrongSo three searches will be placedstrong p  ol liFloor Finishli liFloorli liFinishli ol  pstrongThat would produce a query likestrongp  precode SELECT ID, posttitle FROM tps3posts WHERE poststatus  publish AND posttitle LIKE floor finish    UNION    SELECT ID, posttitle FROM tps3posts WHERE poststatus  publish AND posttitle LIKE floor    UNION    SELECT ID, posttitle FROM tps3posts WHERE poststatus  publish AND posttitle LIKE finish  codepre  pAfter examining my query, I began to realize thats not very efficient.p  pIts placing the Exact Match Floor Finish search first, followed by each of the Broad Match Floor, Finish searches.p  pSo the first go around, finds all posts with Floor Finish somewhere in the title of the article.p  pSo there should already a list of IDs selected.p  pNow, when MySQL goes to place the second search The first Broad Match Floor search. Its looking through ALL posts to find an article title match containing Floor. This includes looking through the same posts which have already been located from the exact match Which I dont want  Seems redundant..p  pThis same behavior is continued for each broad search. Thus causing unnecessary searching.p  pSo is there any way, with multiple queries combined into one, that each following query DOESNT look through posts which an codeIDcode column, and codeposttitlecode column has already been selectedp  pOr another way of wording it... Each query thats selecting the same columns, but has a different search term, checks to see if an codeIDcode column and codeposttitlecode column has already been selected, and if so, ignore that codeIDcode, and continue looking for new codeIDcodes which havent already been selected.p  pOr does MySQL already handle that internally since Im issuing multiple queries combined into one queryp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIt seems I was over complicating it all. Using the selected answer, and querying all three columns as mentioned towards the top of my question. codeposttitlecode, codepostnamecode, codepostexcerptcodep  pThe query looks like thisp  precode  SELECT ID , postname , NULL AS posttitle , NULL AS postexcerpt FROM tps3posts WHERE poststatus  publish  AND  postname LIKE floorfinish OR  postname LIKE floor OR  postname LIKE finish    UNION   SELECT ID , NULL AS postname , posttitle , NULL AS postexcerpt FROM tps3posts WHERE poststatus  publish  AND  posttitle LIKE floor finish OR  posttitle LIKE floor OR  posttitle LIKE finish    UNION   SELECT ID , NULL AS postname , NULL AS posttitle , postexcerpt FROM tps3posts WHERE poststatus  publish  AND  postexcerpt LIKE floor finish OR  postexcerpt LIKE floor OR  postexcerpt LIKE finish    codepre

Negative 457 pIm trying to implement a feature that lets a user know about the activity of other users over certain page, for example, lets suppose we have a blog, and users can edit blog posts, Id like that when a user enters the edit page for a specific post then a message is displayed saying User1, User2, ..., UserN are editing this post too.p  pThe easiest way to implement this would be that when a user enters the edit page a thing we can know based on what controller action we are rendering then we store this data on some kind of memory is Rails.cache a good choice for this, and when the user leaves the page we remove that record from the memory a solution for this could be using the onunload event handler, but this is not useful for my case because it skips several cases, and also im using AJAX which implies that i dont unload my whole DOM. On the other hand i thought of using web sockets or Faye.. but well, lets keep it short and go straight to the point I want it to be as real time as possible, which means,  Im on the edit page, initially a message might be displayed if some users are already editing the page, when a new one comes to edit the same post it should be added to the message, and if one leaves the edit page this should be removed from the edit page...for that the concrete questions arep  ol liWhat kind of memory would you use in Rails to keep this information, or would you use Faye  subscribeunsubscribe to channel event handlerli liHow can a user say 3 things Hey server, im on the page, Hey server, Im still on the page and Hey server, Im leaving this page.li ol  pThank you guys in advance for your helpp  pPD Im usign Rails 3.p

Negative 457 pI currently have a screen that can have multiple range sliders on it. Each slider has a total range of 0 to the maximum the combination of sliders can have. For example codestart 0 end 20codep  pWithin my application I would like to set some limits for the values a user can select via the sliders. So while the slider visual range gives you the full appearance of 0  20 for each individual slider the user can only select 2  10 and then I later validate that the total sum of all the sliders is within an acceptable range up to 20.p  pcurrently I have some code like this which seems to do nothingp  precodeself.qtyForm.onchange.fndtn.slider, .rangeslider, function e      var rng  this,         qty  parseIntrng.dataslider, 10      if qty gt maxChoiceQty          rng.foundationslider, setvalue, maxChoiceQty           if qty lt minChoiceQty          rng.foundationslider, setvalue, minChoiceQty       codepre  pI also noticed that as soon as I touch the slider knob the change event fires.

Negative 457 pIm currently working on a project which leverages the MVVM pattern, and have came across this scenario.p  pSupposed a class Model  INotifyPropertyChanged contains some properties, for examplep  precodepublic class Model  INotifyPropertyChanged      private string rabbit     public string Rabbit              get  return rabbit          setter  rabbit  value OnPropertyChangedRabbit        codepre  pNow, I wish to write a ViewModel which wraps around Model, exposing the properties of Model together with additional properties commands, etc.p  pThe problem comes when writing the getters and setters for the properties already existing in Model. I have commented out the specific portion of the code.p  precodepublic class ViewModel  INotifyPropertyChanged      private Model modelObject     public string Rabbit              get  return modelObject.rabbit          setter                        modelObject.rabbit  value              OnPropertyChangedRabbit  Should OnPropertyChanged be called here                    public ViewModelModel modelObject               this.modelObject  modelObject       codepre  pI am not sure if I should call OnPropertyChanged again in the ViewModel. Since the View binds to the ViewModel but should not be able to access the model, it seems only logical to do so.p  pP.S. the reason I made my model observable is the same model will be used elsewhere apart from the GUI in the same memory space, where there is also a need to be notified of changes to the model.p
Negative 457 pI am making a very basic game in php for school. In this game you can buy money and troops for now. When you press the money button you get 100 and if you press the troops button you can buy the troops for 400. p  pNow here is my problem. If you have too little money you cant buy troops, thats logical. What I want to do is display how much money you are missing. I already have a database with the columns money and troops. So what I need to do is place the value for money into a php variable and subtract that from the 400 dollars that is needed to get 1 troop.p  pHow can I place that value into a php variable Thanks in advance. p
Negative 457 h1Backgroundh1  pIm working with Polymer .5 as an html web component layer, on top of that Ive built a modular JS Core, for pubsub eventing, based on designs by Nicholas Zakas and a a hrefhttpcode.tutsplus.comtutorialswritingmodularjavascriptnet14746 relnofollowwalkthrougha by Andrew Burgess.p  pI know that there are other methods for achieving this, outlined in the Polymer a hrefhttpcode.tutsplus.comtutorialswritingmodularjavascriptnet14746 relnofollowCommunications and Messaging Pagea. But, I dont like coresignals, the recommended pubsub method, as much as a proper JS Core and Sandbox.p  pMy issue is that when I pass a Method inside of my Polymer definition as a callback for a specific event.  When that an event is raised and the method gets called from the Core, this reflects the list of bound events rather than methods and properties in the Polymer element.  Which means I cant update any of my databound variables to effectively update the DOM of my element.  p  h1Codeh1  pThis Code has been stripped down to show the pertinent methods that reflect the issuep  precodeltpolymerelement nameproductpanelgt lttemplategt  ltdiv idproductpanelgt     ltcontentgt     ltulgt          lttemplate repeatitem in listgt         ltli iditem.id datauniquekeyworditem.keywords styleitem.styleString onclickaddToCartgtltimg srcptpresourcesimgitem.imgFilegt             ltpgtitem.labelltpgtltligt         lttemplategt     ltulgt     ltcontentgt ltdivgt  lttemplategt ltscriptgt     Polymerproductpanel,      ready  function           this.input  testinput         this.list  [id 1, keywords red, imgFile1.jpg, labelFirst Item, stylewidth120px, styleString,                      id 2, keywords blue, imgFile2.jpg, labelSecond Item, style, styleString,                      id 3, keywords mobile, imgFile3.jpg, labelThird Item, style, styleString]          this.name  panel         this.sandbox  null          CORE.createmodulethis.name, functionsb, lns          iflns             lns.sandbox  sb                          return              init  function              ,             destroy  function                       , this          this.sandbox.listenperformsearch  this.searchPlain         CORE.startthis.name, this     ,     searchPlain  functionquery          for  product  this.list[i]          if product.label.toLowerCase.indexOfquery.toLowerCase lt 0              product.style.opacity  0.2                                      ltscriptgt ltpolymerelementgt     lthtmlgt codepre  pThe notable portions are the sandbox.listen method which binds the searchPlain method to the performsearch event.

This leads me to believe this is accessing the scope of the Core from where the callback is being made.p  h1Questionh1  pIs it expected that passing a Polymer method as a callback like this will cause it to lose its local scope p  pif so is there another way to bind these methods to events with a JS Core, or a workaround to be able to access the local element variables from a callback methodp

Negative 457 pI am operating in USWest Availability Zone. I was trying to solve the problem for ELB and I courageously or stupidly changed the Source IP of my default VPC security group to fix it. It did not fix the original issue but now I am in to another issue.p  pNow I am trying to restore the default VPC security Group setting in my Amazon Web Service account.p  pAs per my knowledge the default VPC is very restrictive. I dont quite remember what was the value for inbound source IPs.  The issue is that I have changed the Inbound rules Source IP from its original value which I do not remember to Anywhere 0.0.0.00 in the default VPC Security group on AWS Console. p  pSo how do I bring back the original default VPC security rule inbound IP setting that is applicable to my availability zonep  pWhat is the implication of this As a precaution I am not using default VPC Security Group on any of the EC2 instance or ELB. p

Negative 457 pIm working on a Python application which will be handling trajectory data. Im looking at using pandas time series as a way of representing the data basically a series of positions. The documentation describes all the various ways that one can specify the time information, but theres an assumption that its tied to calendar dates. What I really want is to represent time as floating point numbers, starting at 0.0. Is this an appropriate use of pandas constructs If so, is it straightforward to accomplishp
Negative 457 pI am working on a social media site and I am having a problem in profile page. Before I explain you exact problem, let me explain what I am actually trying to do. p  pImagine Facebook... When you go into someones profile page, you see an Add Friend button. But if you go back your page, you wont see the same Add Friend button even though, they use the same view. This is what I was trying to do. And I did it. No problem so far. p  pMy problem starts here. I would like to switch the colour, text, and href of Add Friend according to friendship table.p  pSo, if I am not friend with a person, when I go into persons page Add Friend will appear. This is done. But if I sent a request already and waiting for other user to respond, I want to change button colour to yellow, change text to Cancel Request, and href.p  pThis is my helper and this method figures out whether to display buttons or notp  precodemodule ProfilesHelper     displaybuttons        Purpose of this helper is to find out if user is in hisher own profile page.    According to that, this statement will decide to display buttons or not.    def displaybuttons     if params[id].tos  currentuser.id.tos  params[username].tos  currentuser.username.tos ampamp params[username].tos.blank        This is current users profile, thats why do not display buttons.     else       render commonprofilebuttons     end   end  end codepre  pNow, I have already designed bunch of if statements to figure out which button to use in a profile. And implemented that code to the above code.p  precodemodule ProfilesHelper     displaybuttons        Purpose of this helper is to find out if user is in hisher own profile page.    According to that, this statement will decide to display buttons or not.    def displaybuttons     if params[id].tos  currentuser.id.tos  params[username].tos  currentuser.username.tos ampamp params[username].tos.blank        This is current users profile, thats why do not display buttons.     else       if userid  currentuser.id ampamp friendid  params[id] ampamp status  pending          Cancel Request, Yellow Button       elsif userid  params[id] ampamp friendid  currentuser.id ampamp status  requested          Accept Request, Green Button       elsif  userid  currentuser.id ampamp friendid  params[id] ampamp status  accepted          Unfriend, Red Button       else          Add Friend, Blue Button         render commonprofilebuttons       end     end   end  end codepre  pOkay, My first problem is that, friendid, userid, and status are in friendship table. How can I access this columns, so I can make this if statement workp  pSecond question As you can see in the else statement, I use render to display buttons. So, after I make this if statement work with the help of you, I need to pass variable or somehow manipulate render from helper. So, how can I do that If I use separate buttons partial and render the correct one, I can fix the problem but I will be repeating myself. So, this is not the correct way I guess.p  pBy the way, this is the profilebuttons partialp  precodeltdiv classbuttonsgt   lt linkto Add Friend, addpathprofile.id, class gt btn btnprimary btnsm button gt   lt linkto Send Message, profilepath, class gt btn btndefault btnsm button gt ltdivgt codepre  pThank you.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI guess I figured out the way to access database from helper. I defined this in controllerp  pfriendship  Friendship.findbyuseridandfriendidcurrentuser.id, profile.idp  pSo, by adding friendship in front of userid etc. I can access them. But profile.id is nil. No idea why. But I can print profile.id in a view.p

Negative 457 pNormally when one uses Java 8s parallelStream, the result is execution via the default, common forkjoin pool i.e. ForkJoinPool.commonPool.p  pThat is clearly undesirable, however, if one has work that is far from CPU bound, e.g. may be waiting on IO much of the time.  In such cases one will want to use a separate pool, sized according to other criteria e.g. how much of the time the tasks are likely to be actually using the CPU.p  pTheres no emobviousem means of getting parallelStream to use a different pool, but there is a way as detailed a hrefhttpblog.krecan.net20140318howtospecifythreadpoolforjava8parallelstreamsherea.p  pUnfortunately, that approach entails invoking the terminal operation on the parallel stream from a forkjoin pool thread.  The downside of this is that if the targetfork join pool is completely busy with existing work, the whole execution will wait on it while doing absolutely nothing.  Thus the pool can become a bottleneck worse than single threaded execution.  By contrast, when one uses parallelStream in the normal fashion, ForkJoinPool.common.externalHelpComplete or ForkJoinPool.common.tryExternalUnpush are used to let the calling thread from outside the pool help in the processing.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to embothem get parallelStream to use a nondefault forkjoin pool emandem have a calling thread from outside the forkjoin pool help in the processing of this work but not the rest of the forkjoin pools workp
