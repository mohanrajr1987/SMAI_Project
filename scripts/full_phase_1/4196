Positive 4196 pIm attempting to build a page using Themeroller widgets and Ive run into some bugs and cant figure out why. The first one my drag element keeps going behind my drop element instead of over it.

And the last one Im trying to use datepicker which of course doesnt have a theme right now to have the user input their birthday. I would like them to press and go and receive a notification that just spits their birthday back at them, I cant seem to be able to do this with datepicker.value.

I find that the css and jquery that I am using causes the cell to immediately jump to the end of the fill animation for some reason.p  pIm also not great with this type of transition, probably going about it in a very cack handed way.p  pHere is my code so far, you should be able to copy and paste this into an .html doc and it will run accepting mouse presses in place of finger holdsp  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt   ltmeta charsetutf8gt   ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt   lttitlegtarrived demolttitlegt   ltlink relstylesheet hrefcode.jquery.commobile1.4.5jquery.mobile1.4.5.min.cssgt   ltscript srccode.jquery.comjquery1.10.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript srccode.jquery.commobile1.4.5jquery.mobile1.4.5.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltstylegt   html, body  padding 0 margin 0 webkituserselect none   html, .uimobile, .uimobile body      height 85px      .uimobile, .uimobile .uipage      minheight 85px      nav      fontsize 200     width17.1875em     margin17px auto 0 auto      nav a      color 777     border 2px solid 777     backgroundcolor ccc     padding 0.2em 0.6em     textdecoration none     float left     marginright 0.3em      nav ahover      color 999     bordercolor 999     background eee      nav a.selected,   nav a.selectedhover      color 0a0     bordercolor 0a0     background afa      .box      width 200px     height 100     backgroundcolor e1e1e1      .box.arrived      backgroundcolor green       Shutter Out Horizontal  .hvrshutterouthorizontal, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2    display inlineblock   verticalalign middle   webkittransform translateZ0   transform translateZ0   boxshadow 0 0 1px rgba0, 0, 0, 0   webkitbackfacevisibility hidden   backfacevisibility hidden   mozosxfontsmoothing grayscale   position relative   background e1e1e1   webkittransitionproperty color   transitionproperty color   webkittransitionduration 1s   transitionduration 1s  .hvrshutterouthorizontalbefore, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2before    content    position absolute   zindex 1   top 0   bottom 0   left 0   right 0   background green   webkittransform scaleX0   transform scaleX0   webkittransformorigin 50   transformorigin 50   webkittransitionproperty transform   transitionproperty transform   webkittransitionduration 1s   transitionduration 1s   webkittransitiontimingfunction easeout   transitiontimingfunction easeout  .hvrshutterouthorizontal2background green .hvrshutterouthorizontal2beforebackground e1e1e1  .hvrshutterouthorizontalhover, .hvrshutterouthorizontalfocus, .hvrshutterouthorizontalactive,  .hvrshutterouthorizontal2hover, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2focus, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2active    color white  .hvrshutterouthorizontal.tapbefore, .hvrshutterouthorizontal2.tapbefore    webkittransform scaleX1   transform scaleX1   td      padding 20px     verticalalign middle   tr tdfirstchild      width 500px       ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt  lttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgtPersons namelttdgt         lttd idt1 classbox hvrshutterouthorizontalgtlttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgtSomeone elses namelttdgt         lttd classbox hvrshutterouthorizontalgtlttdgt     lttrgt  ltscriptgt      document .readyfunction          fori1ilt100i             iflocalStorage.getItemti  Y                 ti.addClassarrived                                 var tapTime  0     .box.bindvmousedown vmouseup, function event          if event.type  vmousedown              tapTime  new Date.getTime             ifthis.hasClassarrived                 if already marked as arrived                 this.addClasshvrshutterouthorizontal2                 this.addClasstap              else                  if not arrived                 this.addClasstap                          this.addClasstap          else              event.type  vmouseup             here you can check how long the tap was to determine what do do              var duration  new Date.getTime  tapTime             if duration gt 1000                  this is a taphold                 ifthis.hasClassarrived                     if already marked as arrived                   else                      this.removeClasstap                     this.removeClasshvrshutterouthorizontal                     this.addClassarrived                                     localStorage.setItemt1,Y              else                  this is a tap                 this.removeClasstap                            ltscriptgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pEDIT .gif of how it behaves, the circles around the mouse represent my mouse being clicked and held down a hrefhttpgfycat.comSecondhandSlipperyAngora relnofollowhttpgfycat.comSecondhandSlipperyAngoraap  pYou can see that the initial animation, filling the background with green from the center until the whole cell is green works just fine.p  pHowever when I click again to fill from the center as grey, the whole cell immediately turns grey.

Positive 4196 pIn our case, we develop our website using ASP.NET 4.0 c, p  blockquote   ptheres a tree view control on the left part of web page, and document   html on the right part.p blockquote  pJust like MSDN or Java API. p  pWe want to add a strongresizable splitter barstrong between the tree view control and doc html, so that the width can be changed when user resize it. In addition, strongif the page refreshes or user chooses another node on tree view control, the new width is applied.strong p  blockquote   pCurrently, we use jqueryui to implement the resizable bar, we made   the right border of tree view control resiable, so that it can work   well with node wrap feature of tree view control.

Negative 4196 pI have an application that imports information from a CSV file or from a database and exports it to XML. This XML is currently being persisted to a file. However due to project needs I have decided it may be better to persist this XML to a database.p  pCurrently I have CSV, XML and SQL repositories that deal with importingexporting data. The XML repository persists the passed in object to a file. It currently is where the mapping of the object to XML is stored, hence it is the only place that knows about this structure likewise, the other repositories for their respective structures.p  pNow that I want to store the XML in the database I am beginning to question this architecture. In order to do an insert into the database, the structure of the XML must be accessible from the SQL repository n.b. data in other columns can be inserted into the DB along with the XML. This leads me to wonder if the XML representation should be stored in the object itself, or in a service layer or somewhere else.p  pWhat are the best ways to implement a solution to this problemp  pUPDATE A clarification to my question. The XML repository currently persists to a file. It seems to me that this is the wrong level to keep the knowledge of the structure of the XML at, as then I dont have flexibility in persisting the XML representation to whatever medium I desire. Is it poor design to let the object have knowledge of its XML representation or CSV representation, etc Should the knowledge of that structure be kept at another level, and what level would that bep

Negative 4196 pI currently have a tomcat container  servlet running on it listening for requests. I need the result of an HTTP request to be a submission to a job queue which will then be processed asynchronously. I want each job to be persisted in a row in a DB for tracking and for recovery in case of failure. Ive been doing a lot of reading. Here are my options note I have to use opensource stuff for everything.p  p1 JMS  use ActiveMQ but who is the consumer of the job in this case another servletp  p2 Have my request create a row in the DB. Have a seperate servlet inside my Tomcat container that always runs  it Uses Quartz Scheduler or utilities provided in java.util.concurrent to continously process the rows as jobs uses thread pooling.p  pI am leaning towards the latter because looking at the JMS documentation gives me a headache and while I know its a more robust solution I need to implement this relatively quickly. Im not anticipating huge amounts of load in the early days of deploying this server in any case.p  pA lot of people say Spring might be good for either 1 or 2. However Ive never used Spring and I wouldnt even know how to start using it to solve this problem. Any pointers on how to dive in without having to rewrite my entire project would be useful. p  pOtherwise if you could weigh in on option 1 or 2 that would also be useful.p  pClarification The asynchronous process would be to screen scrape a thirdparty web site, and send a message notification to the original requester. The thirdparty web site is a bit flaky and slow and thats why it will be handled as an asynchronous process several retry attempts built in. I will also be pulling files from that site and storing them in S3.p

Negative 4196 pI was wondering whether anyone had managed to use the listing. command in JPL to examine the contents of the Prolog knowledgebase  JPL requires you construct queries and will return solutions based on the variables which you set in the query.

I suppose what I require if the listing function cannot be called using JPL, is a function which returns as a variable the predicate head along with a list of the relevant goals which must be satisfied.  Unfortunately, Im not familiar with the internals of the listing function, so Im not sure how to go about doing this.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4196 pThis is primarily a question about effective Git usage. I should first say Im not an expert in Rails at least in a production sense and definitely a Git newbie, however, I have had  some experience using SVN.p  pMy problem is that I am trying to create a rails application but do not know the best way to keep development local on my computer but be able to deploy to my shared hosting account on Dreamhost. p  pI figured that Git would allow me to do this, but I am not completely sure how. I was thinking of creating a Git repo on the server and having my local stuff pushed onto it after each commit. I have read a few tutorials on Git, but am still confused on what to do. The alternative to this would be to just use FTP and copy over the files but that doesnt seem right.p  pDoes anybody have a few first steps andor commands that I can use Is this deployment method fishy or is there a better way to do thisp

Thats not the case hereall of the work objects do their work on the same thread, and a complete work operation might span multiple calls to codeworkObject.DoSomeWorkcode. In this case, whats a reasonable approach for offering the caller some handle for progress notification, completion, and getting the final outcome of the operationp

Negative 4196 pI have a page that has a bunch of different iframes A, B, C, D  all of which are fully visible at all times. Together, they make up the various portions of my applications UI. One of these iframes, iframe D  houses another, smaller iframe iframe X that is sometimes made visible by a user action. It should automatically disappear whenever the user clicks outside of it.  I can easily handle this from within iframe D by putting an onclick on the body. If I actually detect a click in iframe Ds body  that means they arent clicking in iframe X, so I can hide iframe X via CSS. No problem. p  pThe problem is the other iframes  A, B, and C. If a user clicks within those, I want to hide iframe X also. Currently, I have it working  but not well. For each of those iframes A, B, C, I have code that will communicate body clicks to iframe D. I dont like this approach because iframes A, B, C all have knowledge of iframe X  there really should be no need for this, and it just adds to files I have to change to support the feature offered by iframe X. strongIs there any way I can handle detecting external onclick events all from within iframe Dstrong This would leave the iframe X showhide logic within iframe D, which makes the code much easier to move around.p  pIf I get that onclick monitoring going  Im also wondering if it would handle emallem clicks  for example, if iframe A has some onclick events set on specific elements  am I sure to also catch those clicks I mention this because my current workaround seems to be flawed iframes A, B, C report their body onclicks to iframe D  certain clicks are not triggering body onclick.p  pThanks in advance guys. Please keep in mind, though, that removing iframes isnt realistic at this point in the project. p

Negative 4196 pI am working on a contest site where there are two types of users, normal site members, and judges.

Negative 4196 pGreetings allp  pI currently am building a web application, and have been debating whether to go with a conventional database login system, or going with an openid based login system as we have on stackoverflow and family.

Negative 4196 pIve create a Windows Service using C that when OnStart is called creates a new thread from another class. This new thread then loops waiting for any incoming TCP connections.

Negative 4196 pIn my WPF application, I host Win32 content using HwndHost. However, creating a HwndHost does not create the native window. Rather, this is done in the overridden codeBuildWindowCorecode method which is called sometime later by WPF.p  pMy hosted content needs the window handle of the native window for its own initialization. Unfortunately, there is no way I can force the creation of the window i.e. having WPF call the BuildWindowCore, so I have a second thread which polls the HwndHost until it has been initialized.p  pIn .NET 4.0  WPF 4.0, a new method codeWindowInteropHelper.EnsureHandlecode was added. I had hoped this would resolve the situation, but it only works for a Window, not a HwndHost which doesnt derive from Window. Do you have a suggestion what I could do insteadp  pEDITp  pI forgot to add some more constraints for a possible solutionp  ol liThe HwndHost is placed in a control which, depending on user settings, can be a child of the applications main window or can be placed in a new Window via a thirdparty docking manager. This means that during creation of the window I do not know for sure what the parent Window and thus its hWnd will be.li liWhile the native code needs the hWnd during its initialization, the window is only displayed when the user requests it to be shown i.e. it is invisible at first. Needing to show the window, only to hide it immediately again, should be avoided, if possible.li ol

Negative 4196 pLooking for a noncloud based open source app for doing data transformation though for a killer and I mean killer app just built for data transformations, I might be willing to spend up to 1000.p  pIve looked at a hrefhttpwww.manning.comcross relnofollowPerla, a hrefhttpkapowsoftware.comproductskapowkatalystplatformindex.php relnofollowKapow Katalysta, a hrefhttpkettle.pentaho.com relnofollowPentaho Kettlea, and more.p  pstrongPerl, Python, Rubystrong which are clearly languages, but unable to find any frameworksDSLs just for processing data meaning theyre really not a great development environments, meaning theres no built GUIs for building RegEx, InputOutput CSV, XML, JDBC, REST, etc., no debugger for testing rows and rows of data  theyre not bad either, just not what Im looking for, which is a GUI built for complex data transformations that said, Id love if the GUIapp file was in a scripting language, and NOT just stored in some not human readable XMLASCII file.p  pstrongKapow Katalyststrong is made for accessing data via HTTP HTML, CSS, RSS, JavaScript, etc. its got a nice GUI for transforming unstructured text, but thats not its core value offering, and is way, way too expensive.

Itd be super cool if it could profile data sets, which is a feature Kettle sort of does, but not super well. Id also like built in unit testing, meaning Im able to build out control sets of data, and run changes made against the control set. Then Id like to be able to selectively filter out rows and columns as I build out the transformation without altering the build for example, I run a data set through transformation, filter the results, and the next run those sets are automatically blocked at the first logical occurrence which in turn would mean less data to look at and a reduced runtime per each enhanced iteration what would be crazy nice is if as Id filtering out the rowscolumns the app is tracking those, and the output was filtered out. and unit testedhighlighted any changes. If I made a change that would effect the application logs and its ability to track the unit tests based on me breaking a branch  itd give me a warning, let me dump the data stored branch... andor track the primary keys for difference in next generation of output, or even attempt to match them using fuzzy logic. And yes, I know this is a pipe dream, but hey, figured Id ask, just in case theres something out there Ive just never seen.p  pFeel free to comment, Id be happy to answer any questions, or offer additional info. p

Negative 4196 pIm new to MVC so have some conceptual issues.  I have a WebGrid that populates with data from a viewmodel, and with that is a DropDownList that the user can select how many records to return 50, 100, etc., which is also a property on the VM.  I have set the DDLs onchange client side event to fire this.form.submit and my controller action gets the POST.  The trouble is logic for refreshing the view doesnt fire.  The View simply updates the selected value in the DDL.p  p Controller actions p  precodepublic ShopsController      ViewBag.PageList      new SelectListnew[]  10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 1000          .Selectx gt new  value  x, text  x , value, text   [HttpGet] public ActionResult Index      var model  new ShopsViewModel     return Viewmodel  [HttpPost] public ActionResult Indexint RowsPerPage      var model  new ShopsViewModel     TryUpdateModelmodel     return Viewmodel  codepre  pThe View uses JSON to update the data in the grid so it can be paged using the technique Malcolm Sheridan a hrefhttpwww.dotnetcurry.comShowArticle.aspxID618 relnofollowblogged about herea. Ive snipped code for brevity.p  precode    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function            fire JSON request to initially fill grid         .getJSONShopsShopsPager, null, function d              grid.appendd.Data              DataTable tfoot a.liveclick, function event                  event.preventDefault                 OnPageClickthis.text                           tLinks a.liveclick, function event                  event.preventDefault                 OnPageClickthis.text                             ltscriptgt Html.BeginForm      this is the DDL that when changed, I want the view to refresh using the new value     ltdiv classrlinks stylefloatrightgtDisplayampnbsp          Html.DropDownListRowsPerPage, ViewBag.PageList as SelectList,             newonchange this.form.submitampnbspItems per page     ltdivgt     ltdiv idgrid classgridWrappergt         lt the grid get inserted here by the JSON callback     ltdivgt codepre  pSo what happens is the page loads and the JSON call fetchs the WebGrid with the number of rows currently specified in Model.RowsPerPage property.  Change it from say 25 to 50 the submit fires and the Index POST action gets called.  The parameter is correct and TryUpdateModel correctly updates the value of RowsPerPage.  The action returns the default view with the updated model, but the View does not refresh, it does not perform the JSON call.  Since Im not really really sure how this routing and AJAX works together this is probably something simple.p

Negative 4196 pI have a class that manages a process. When calling codeStopcode or codeDisposecode on this class, it will first send TCP command to the process to ask it to close itself, then check back in 1 second time, if its not close, call codeCloseMainWindowcode, then wait another seconds, if its still running, call codeKillcode.p  pNow I have a codeListltgtcode of this class to manage a bunch of processes. When I would like to remove them from the list, I would manually call codeDisposecode, then codeRemovecode. I want to make sure that I called codeDisposecode before I loose the only reference. Since calling codeDisposecode will take at least 2 second to return, it will take a while if I have say 5 items to be removed.p  pSo I intended to have another function called codeSafeDisposecode which codeInvokecode codeDisposecode then return. Now removing these from the list and calling codeSafeDisposecode instead of codeDisposecode will be immediate while the classes itself disposing themselves slowly.p  pIs it advisable to do so p

Negative 4196 pI made a web project, packaged it in a war file and deployed in jboss  worked great I have done this 100 times before and succeeded. Today, I modify the same project and created the war file again and deployed the project to a clustered jboss server jboss4.0.5.GA running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.4 Tikanga as usual, I expect the changes to reflect.. When I accessed the project via the browser, my changes do not show. When I deploy the same war file on my laptop Windows 7 the changes show perfectly So I stop the jboss server, delete tmp and work directories on the clustered jboss servers plus the war file in farm folder... then deploy the new .war file.. I start the server again.. I expect the changes to show now on the server but they do not I have tried this over and over but no success in having the latest .war file run..p  pHas anyone experienced this and whats the solution p

Negative 4196 pIm currently working on generating an API from an adhoc enterprise solution and Im stuck in the process of generating a both generic and expressive class for handling the status for operations in related classes.p  pIn a nutshell, what I want to know is which are the standards or best practices on designing a Status handler. What I want to achieve is that methods and classes that belong to a common module, all of them return and handle status messages that belong to a defined status structure, so the different status messages are not that dependent of implementation.p  pA possible solution would be    Create a Status Class in the module that defines a series of status numbers as Constants        The Status class would manage only those defined status numbers and would define status messages for each one.   The methods of the module that require status handling return an instance of Status, that is handled in higher layers of the module, and not hard coded in each method.p  pAny suggestions for better models How does good APIs manage thisp

Actually above case doesnt become a problem since theres no text between two closing parentheses, but it becomes a big problem when theres a link between two closing parentheses.p  pOne dirty solution I can think is thisp  precodescontent of a wikipedia articledepth0s2 fori0iltstrlensi     csubstrs,i,1     ifcdepth     ifcifdepthgt0depthcontinue     ifdepth0 s2.c  ss2 codepre  pHowever, I dont like this solution since it cuts down a string into single characters and that looks like unnecessary...p  pIs there other ways to remove text in a pair ofmatching parenthesesp  pFor example, I want to make this textp  precodeblahasdffoobarlolasdfblah codepre  pinto thisp  precodeblahblah codepre  pbut not like thisp  precodeblahbarasdfblah codepre  hr  pEdit  from a comment of Emil Vikstrms answer, I realized that above approachremove texts between parentheses may remove a link containing parentheses. However, I still want the answer of above problem, since I met similar problem before and I want to know the answer...p  pSo my question is still how to remove texts between matching parenthesesp

Negative 4196 pI have a need to create a packaging of UI classes that can be included in an XCode4 strongemintegration projectemstrong by a developer and then get instantiated through the use of a config file in conjunction withNSClassFromString  a strongemstatic pluginemstrong. I have had success with creating libraries that contain UIViews that layout based on code. Now I am trying to allow the developer to create UIs based on xib files and other resources. I am implementing the most basic version of this...a UIViewController loading a xib file created directly through the new file wizard in XCode4. The only modification I am making is adding a label to the UI in the xib. p  pI am having problems getting the xib loaded. If I include the xib in the strongemintegration projectemstrong all is well. When I create the UIViewController from the library it finds the xib in the root of the app bundle and loads it. However, this is very cumbersome during the build of the strongemintegration projectemstrong, I would like to be able to just link to the library and not have to add each xib to the strongemintegration projectemstrong individually. Additionally the use of the root of the application bundle is bad because there is no directory structure that could facilitate multiplestrongemstatic pluginsemstrong. I have tried creating a folder that thestrongemintegration projectemstrong can includeduring its build and the xibs for thestatic plugincan just be dumped into folder prior to build. If I do this the xib gets into the app bundle but when the UIViewController class loads up it cannot find the xibs. I have been unable to code a solution to get the UIViewController toinitWithNibNamebundleproperly when the xibs are in the subfolder. p  pMy last attempt has been to create a static framework using this articlea hrefhttpsimplyitinc.blogspot.com201104creatingstaticframeworkinxcode4.htmlhttpsimplyitinc.blogspot.com201104creatingstaticframeworkinxcode4.htmla . That seems to get me a framework I can link against and the xib is in that framework directory but ... the xib does not get placed into the app bundle when I link against the framework. My classes are available but fail to load the xib, obviously because it is not in the app bundle. p  pAny suggestion on how this requirement might be accomplished p

Negative 4196 pEDIT resolved. See below...p  pI had async NSURLConnections working just fine when I was using my viewController as the delegate, have all sorts of connections now and I want to do them all through a singleton Connection object. So Im having Connection create a new delegate object for each connection it makes. Connection is instantiated in the app delegate, but the codevoidsendMessage code function probably terminates.p  pMy feeling about how this works is that the delegate listeners get put in the run loop Im not totally clear on this but I think theyre not in separate threads. Shouldnt matter because the delegates allocate their own responseData memory. and the connectionDidFinishLoading executes just fine, but with an empty responseData. By that I mean I find myself in connectionDidFinishLoading but responseData has zero bytes.p  pCode creating the app delegate in the send method isp  precodeConnectionDelegate delegate  [[ConnectionDelegate alloc] init] NSURLConnection connection[[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequestrequest delegatedelegate] codepre  pSo my question is twofold   1 is the problem that the send method terminates The delegate pointer has local scope.   2 if thats the problem, what can I do to keep the delegate alivep  pEDIT resolved. Ive been fighting with this for 48 hours but writing out the question put me on the right track, sorry. p  pIts a server issue. I had a test for correct content in POST with a  in front of it, and was dropping through the logic there returning zero bytes.p

Negative 4196 pIm using Raphael to create a vector based map. The map is biggish so Im using RaphaelZPD to allow zooming and panning while fitting the image in to a smaller frame. Ive used html5 to create a div set as a tablecell with rounded corners and some inset boxshadows set in the css file. Ive idd my Raphael canvas the same as the div and while it loads nicely, shows all the graphics right, has all the animated elements working properly, stays within the boundaries etc. theres still a slight a problem. The SVG overrides the rounded corner and inset boxshadow attributes set in the css. So instead of rounded corners I get sharp corners. If I pan the map so that there is no Raphael produced graphics overlaying the corner, the rounded corner appears again. Same goes for the shadows.p  pSo is there a way to make the js stay behind these effects Or should I try to go around it by creating inversed rounded corners as absolute elements which stay on the top layer and just forget about the shadowsp  pI hope I was clear with my problem, got a good week of programming experience of any kind so bit shaky with my terminology still.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcgnrh4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netcgnrh4a lt with practice images, also very messyp  precodemap    display tablecell   position absolute   margintop 104px   marginleft 350px   borderradius 0 2em 2em 0   boxshadow inset 3px 0 7px 777   width 550px   height 900px   background FFFFFF   var paper  Raphaelmap codepre

Negative 4196 pi have a water pond, in which fishes will move to a food, currently now im having problem making it look realistic, when a food is dropped, all fishes move to it at the same speed, and that is a kind of drift like a car drifting,when it is approaching a food while rotating to it. may i know what is wrong i am thinking it is because of the drag force i have applied, but if i do not apply it, the vx and vy will add up to large amounts.p  pthe link below contains the .swf, i have also attached the nessasry functions needed to make the fish move. a

Negative 4196 pSo im conceptually stuck building my app. Ive read lots of forums but I think I need to try a new route. Heres what im trying to do. p  pI created a game where each level loads a different string for the user to play with. Right now the strings for the levels are stored in a plist. There are 5 categories arrays each of which contains 20 different strings ie 20 levels so there are 100 levels total. p  pWhen the user starts the game they reach the LevelSelect view which consists of a picker. The picker has two components. the first component is a list of categories, and the second component is the list of levels in that category. The user selects which of the levels they want to play, then press a Start button to bring up the GamePlay view an entirely different set of .h, .m, and .xib files. p  pemstrongMY PROBLEMem I dont know how to make the selected level appear on the screen in the Gameplay class.strong I have all the machinery of the game working, so if I create a string in the viewDidLoad, the game appears to work fine, but I want to have the string for that level come onto the screen when that level is selected and the user presses start.p  pstrongMY QUESTION How do I pass the string from LevelSelect to GamePlaystrongp  pThanks for any help you can offerp

Negative 4196 pI am using wordpress to build a portfolio website. I am currently showing the featured image of my post on the main blog and have a coloured overlay when rolling overhovering the image, that changes according to the category the post is in. Currently I am doing that by using a transparent 1x1px image as background url in my CSS resizing it to the size of the image.p  pWhat I would like to do is for the colour rollover to show all different category colours in stripes if a post is in multiple categories. For example if my categories and colours are the following...p  pPrint Work  Greenp  pWeb  Redp  pMoving Image  Purplep  p...and I have a post that goes into Print work and Web the hover state should be half green and half red over the image. If a post is in all three categories the hover state should be in 3 colours 3 stripes  1 green,1 red and 1 purple next to each other.p  pI havent found any clue on whether thats possible in my searches and dont quite know where to start. Is this achievable at all and if so with using CSS only or Jqueryp

Negative 4196 pI have gwt web project, which must use application.properties on client side loaded as TextResource in the code. Everything works fine, but now i want to centralize all properties values in maven pom.xml. So i made application.properties with placeholders like key1param1 and in the pom.xml i configured property param1Valuep  pSo, what happening is that maven replaces the placeholders in application.properties in target dir, but it seems that gwt compiler uses the application.properties file from srcmainresources. I checked the compiled js files and i there i can see that the placeholder is not replaced with its value from the pom.xml targets application.properties is correct.p  pUPDATE The problem is that, the properties file I am filtering is a gwt messages resources bundle file and from what I saw, maven creates a generated folder and puts a generated java file based on the properties file found in the root project sources folder and not in the target folder. After that, it incorporates it in the javascript general file. This means I have two possibilities 1 tell the resources plugin to overwrite the properties file located in the sources folder I am not cool with that because I will certanly have problems on the next subversion update 2 tell gwtmavenplugin to seek the properties file in the targetclasses folder which I think it is impossiblep  pWhat do you think p

Negative 4196 pI am working on a site for mobile devices.  The site is available through normal web browsers and also through an app which is just a browser shell and brings up the mobile site.  In our efforts to speed up the loading of the site in mobile we have reduced requsts, made use of data uris, etc.  Recently we have started using localStorage to save styles and JavaScript data to the device.p  pWhy you may ask In our testing, mobile browsers maintain their cache throughout their session and when the browser is closed and reopened.  The app maintains its cache as long as it is being used, but when it is closed and reopened it rerequests everything, thus slowing down that initial load.p  pThe problem is, we have styles and JavaScript that are specific for if you are in the browser or in the app for a few small things.  Weve seen a few things break around these subtle differences and my best theory is that localStorage is shared between the browser and the app.  And a user that uses both the site and the app may have problems if the localStorage was set by one and needs something else for the other.p  pI cant find any documentation that confirms this theory or not, and short of creating an app just to test this I figured Id ask if anyone has any ideasp

Negative 4196 pstrongThe situationstrongp  pIm writing my first iPhone app its an opengl game and I want to use separate views... The first view is the menu screen, a normal UIViewUIViewController with a high scores list and some buttons for configuring and starting a new game. The second view is a GLKViewGLKViewController combo, which will display the game.p  pI have a model, which includes the game state, player data, the high scores list, etc. I need to share this model between the two views. Ive seen examples of this before, where the model is instantiated in the application delegate, and references to it are passed to each view controller that needs access to it. Id do it that way, but I dont know how to access the view controllers in my storyboard.p  pstrongMy questionsstrongp  pIs this the way I should be doing things To reiterate, I want my model to be owned by the AppDelegate, and I will pass references to the view controllers from the applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions method. If theres a better way to solve this problem, please let me know.p  pAssuming the above is the right way to do things, how would I go about doing it Im not sure how to access the items in the storyboard.p

Negative 4196 pI want to test some code that relies on a network transmission.  The code makes a request and supplies a callback  when the request completes, the callback is fired.  Id like to mock out the network transmission, and use codeThread.sleepcode to simulate some latency... but of course that will make the whole test pause.p  pSo far Ive been making new threads and using codeCountDownLatchcodees throughout the test to stop the test from ending before the callback is fired.  My mock network object makes a new thread, sleeps on that thread, and then fires the callback.  Thats actually working pretty well, but the problem is that any assertion errors in the callback are not reported to the original junit thread  instead, Im getting exception text on the console, where its much harder to understand and use.p  pIm hoping theres eitherp  ol liA way to pipe codeassertEqualscode output from spawned threads into the main JUnit output collector, or li liA totally different and better way to test threaded code in JUnit, or li liSome way to simulate asynchronous code in a single threadli ol  pThanks for any ideasp

Negative 4196 pA strange bug I cant track down. Ive implemented a codeContactListenercode class for  handling collisions in my Android game. In the codebeginContactContact arg0code method I can see that the two bodies in codearg0code is there, and pushed onto a stack. Right after calling codeworld.stepcode I run my own codehandleCollisionscode method, where I pop off the codeContactcode objects and do some game logic. However, occasionally when I pop off a codeContactcode, one or both of its bodies are null.p  pThe codeContactcode goes in the stack with its bodies there, but it comes out with null bodies. I dont know why this is occurring, and more importantly, I cant find when this is occurring. To my knowledge, none of my code elsewhere is removing the bodies, but then again there could be side effects Im unaware of. It doesnt help that this doesnt always happen. Typically it occurs when theres several collisions occurring.p  pAnyone have any ideas on what might remove the bodies Or, does anyone know of a way to track the bodies to determine when they become nullp  pBelow is some code which may or may not be helpfulp  precodepublic class ConcreteContactListener implements ContactListener      private StackltContactgt contacts      public ConcreteContactListener              contacts  new StackltContactgt           Override     public void beginContactContact arg0              contacts.pusharg0         System.out.printlnpush   arg0.mfixtureA.mbody        public int handleCollisionsArrayListltBallgt balls, World world, ArrayListltBallgt smears, SoundEffects sfx, Combos combos      int score  0      while contacts.isEmpty              Contact contact  contacts.pop         System.out.printlnContact   contact.mfixtureA.mbody         int a  1         int b  1          for int i  0 i lt balls.size i                      System.out.printlnBall   balls.geti.getBody             if contact.mfixtureA.mbody.equalsballs.geti.getBody                  a  i             else if contact.mfixtureB.mbody.equalsballs.geti.getBody                 b  i                   ...         codepre

This profile contains users email, name, a link to the avatar and an strongIDstrong which the OpenID provider has returned.p  pMy strategy for keeping the user logged in is thisp  ul liWhen the user logges in for the first time, I create a hash code based on the OpenIDs returned IDli liI store this hash code alongside the users ID in 2 cookies.li liWhen the user comes to my website, I check for these cookies, and if theyre available, try to match the ID and the hash code, if its correct, I log the user in.li ul  pNow the emproblemem is this if somehow this cookie information gets stolen from the user, the hacker can easily log in instead of the user himself. I could create a new hash code for each time the user logges in and update the users cookeis but itll make the information of other browserscomputers cookies invalid.p  pSince the StackOverflow website does not suffer from such problem, I would like to know what should I do to both secure my login strategy and add the functionality to stay signed in for the users.p
Negative 4196 pIve downloaded a webpage html and the images inside it.  Now, im trying to display them to the user.  Ive tried two different methods, and not sure which is best to use.  Both have their issues.p  pFirst, I tried a text view with the following codep  precodeTextView content  TextViewfindViewByIdR.id.articlecontent  MyImageGetter mig  new MyImageGetterthis, urlId Spanned span  Html.fromHtmlcontents, mig, null content.setTextspan codepre  pI really like how this works, except two issues.  The first, and most difficult is when an article has lots of images, I get OutOfMemory fcs.  MyImageGetter code is as followsp  precodepublic class MyImageGetter implements Html.ImageGetter  String urlId  null Context c  null  public MyImageGetterArticleViewer articleViewer, String urlId2      c  articleViewer     urlId  urlId2   public Drawable getDrawableString source      String[] brokenUrl  source.split     String imgName  brokenUrl[brokenUrl.length1]      File image  new Filedatadatacom.that1dev.RibbonReaderOffline  urlId    imgName     Log.wMyApp, image.getAbsolutePath     Bitmap bm  BitmapFactory.decodeFileimage.getAbsolutePath      Drawable d  new BitmapDrawablec.getResources, bm      d.setBounds0,0, d.getIntrinsicWidth,d.getIntrinsicHeight      return d    codepre  pThe other issue is the textview has different widths based on user choice and device orientation.  The images in the view simply get cropped if they are larger than the textview width.  However, I believe I can fix that without too much difficultly on my own.  I just havent tried too hard yet since Im trying to fix the memory issue first.  However, any assistance on either would be much appreciated.p  pThe other method Ive tried is a webview.p  precodeWebView webContent  WebViewfindViewByIdR.id.webcontent  webContent.loadDataWithBaseURL, contents[1], texthtml, utf8,  webContent.setBackgroundColorColor.TRANSPARENT codepre  pUnfortunately with this, the background stays white no matter what I try, and is incredibly ugly.  I cannot seem to find a work around that works in 3.0 and 4.0.p  pIf I had a choice, Id really like the TextView method to work, since I preferred the look of it to the way the WebView rendered things.p

Negative 4196 pWhen users cut content from outside sources, like a MS Word doc or another web page, then post that content into the Wordpress WYSIWYG editor, it also pastes a ton of bloated formatting code that skews the format of the published post.p  pIm looking for a plugin that addresses this.p  pIf theres no plugin available, Id have to build one. The best option I can think of is to use javascriptjQuery to strip the formatting before the post is submitted. I would likely use keyUp and keyDown to catch the new content as its pasted.p  pStep 1 Save cursor position upon keyDownp  pStep 2 Save cursor position upon keyUpp  pStep 3 Use regex to strip formatting from everything between keyUp and keyDown.p  pThis would allow me to operate exclusively on the freshly pasted content while keeping the formatting the user has previously created via the WYSIWYG.p  pThough it seems using JavascriptjQuery to record cursor positions within a string is more complicated than I wouldve expected.p  pPreferably, I like suggestions for a plugin that is ready to go. But if not, are there any tips on what functions I should use to catch these cursor positionsp

Negative 4196 pI had huge problems making pecl run on my MAMP 1.9 on Mac OSX and after spending a day on this whole thing I solved it, so I thought Id share it with the others. If you know a better way to do that, perhaps you could tell mep  pBasically, the problem was that I needed to install a few PHP extensions on my MAMP system and in order to do that I needed either pecl or compiler to work. None were functioning though. So the first thing I did was to upgrate to MAMP 2. Then after this I added the path to the MAMPs pecl to the .profile typing into terminal p  precodeecho export PATHApplicationsMAMPbinphpphp5.3.6binPATH gtgt .profile codepre  pYou can then check if your call for pecl is referring to the correct version and not Mac Osxs internal one by typing inp  precodewhich pecl codepre  pNow in order to be able to build the extensions using pecl we need to prepare the build environment for them to compile correctly. a hrefhttpwww.lullabot.comarticlesinstallingphppearandpeclextensionsonmampmacosx107lion relnofollowA good advice is given on this pagea. In short, you need to download MAMPs libraries from their website, then choose the folder with PHP that corresponds to your currently activated version in my case it was php5.3.6 and copy it to ApplicationsMAMPbinphpphp5.3.6include folder. After that you should go into that folder in terminal and run p  precode.configure codepre  pNow, this will work only if you have XCode installed. The problem though is even if its installed, the newer versions of XCode doesnt include commandline tools such as gcc compilers that you need by default. So what you need to do is to either download it through XCode or from Apples website. Once you download these command line tools you should have gcc installed and the .configure command should work fine.p  pIf thats not the case, you could also install MacPort and then use it to install gcc and autoconf  the tools needed for compiling.p  precodeport install autoconf codepre  pAlthough it may be that they are already working as part of XCodes command line tools.p  pIn any case, after all that is done, youll finally be able to run .configure in your php source folder, have it prepared for future work and you can check if it functions by typing inp  precodepecl install uploadprogress codepre  pin order to have that extension initialized youll probably need to add extensionsuploadprogress.so into your php.ini filep  pThats all, I just thought Id lay it all out, because it took me hours to find the right sequence of actions and I hope it will save time for someone else. If you have ideas for how it could be done more efficiently, let me know. p

Negative 4196 pI recently upgraded my iPad to iOS 6.0, but kept my Xcode install at version 4.4.1 and iOS SDK 5.1, since we are about to package up a client app and dont want to take the risk of switching SDKsiOS versions this late in development.p  pNow this iPad no longer shows up in the build target list with its full name, it just says iOS Device.

Negative 4196 pI have a codelttablegtcode where I want the vertical borders in the codelttheadgtcode  codeltthgtcode to be of a different color than the rest of the borders all borders are 1 pixel wide, no border on top of table.

Negative 4196 pIm trying to do a relatively simple animation that requires rotating an ellipse on a rotating background.  Ive had to resort to a bit of trickery to get codepygame.transform.rotatecode to play nice with the surfaces Im trying to rotate.  Namely, Ive made this function that recenters the new rect obtained from pygames rotation functionp  precodedef recenterorigrect, rotatedsurf     oldcenter  origrect.center      rotRect  rotatedsurf.getrect     rotRect.center  oldcenter      screen.blitrotatedsurf, rotRect codepre  pThe functionning is fairly selfexplanatory.  I realize that the original unrotated surface remains blitted onto the display, but this turns out not to really be a problem.  Dont worry about that.p  pThe above function is used by the rotating functions background amp ellipse as suchp  precode width, height, screen are globals def rotatebackgroundsurf, speed, t0     newangle  pygame.time.getticks  t0  speed  1000  360      w, h  surf.getsize     blittedRect  screen.blitsurf, width  2  w  2, height  2  h  2     recenterblittedRect, pygame.transform.rotatesurf, newangle      return surf   def rotateellipsesurf, coords, speed, t0     newangle  pygame.time.getticks  t0  speed  1000  360     if newangle gt 90         newangle  90   limit rotation      w, h  surf.getsize     x, y  coords     blittedRect  screen.blitsurf, width  2  w  2  x, height  2  h  2  y     recenterblittedRect, pygame.transform.rotatesurf, newangle codepre  pThese rotation functions are called one for each frame.p  pHeres a simplified version of my main game loop.  Note that this is not the actual production code, but serves as an illustration of how the above elements which emareem taken directly from the code base tie togetherp  precodeellipse  createellipse   returns a surf background  createbackground   returns a surf  while True     rotatebackground     rotateellipse     pygame.display.flip codepre  pA word about the codebackgroundcode and codeellipsecode variables above.  Both variables contain a codepygame.Surfacecode instance on which things have been drawn.  I wont go into details about codebackgroundcode since that is working fine.  In codecreateellipsecode, an ellipse was drawn onto the codeellipsecode surface by means of codepygame.draw.ellipsecode, in yellow.  Prior to that, codeellipse.fillGREENcode was called.  The colorkey for codeellipsecode was also set to codeGREENcode to make sure that the entire surface is transparent emexceptem where the yellow ellipse was drawn.p  pstrongThe Problem  Im not seeing the ellipsestrongp  pI commented out codeellipse.setcolorkeycode to make sure that the ellipse was properly blitted.  It is.  I see a green rectagle appear that changes in dimension as the ellipse is rotated.  This led me to infer that there is, indeed, an ellipse being drawn since it can be rotated.p  pWhat gives  I can provide the full code if it can be useful.  The whole thing is approximately 200 lines, but I hope my explanation above is enough for you guys.  I figured we should start locally and work outwards p  pThanks very much in advancep

Negative 4196 pI am trying to create my own RESTbased API using Java and Akka. I have created my main algorithmic implementation using Akka already.

Negative 4196 pI have been wrestling with this for a while, in some cases below sql takes over 30min to execute on a table with 100k rows in codecurrentcode and about 10 is codependingcode. This is a portion of a larger join statement that I have identified as being the culprit. Basically the purpose of the sql is to sort a join of codecurrentcode rows and copies of codependingcode rows so that all pending rows are either at the top or bottom. Its part of a management of change framework. Any ideas how this could be done in a mannaer that performs consistently well For the record in some cases the same sql runs in under 10sec on tables that have 10M rows and 100s of pending changes. The problem is compounded by the fact that sorting is done on the calculated field. Database is ms sql server 2008 R2.p  pUpdate Im adding the rest of the joins to show there is semi reason in the madness.p  pAgain the sole purpose of this is to get a combination of current and pending records, to show how a future table will look like after changes has been approved, sorted so the changes are shown either at top or bottom ASC or DSC on the hasPending, the extra Current2 join is to add some additional identifying data.p  pGenerally it does what its supposed to be doing, fairly decent response times of a few seconds, 10 when reaching around 10M records, however is a few cases everything consistenly slows to a crawl, with responsetimes shooting up to 1230min.p  precodeWITH [ResultPage] AS  SELECT      ROWNUMBER OVER      ORDER BY          CASE WHEN [Current].[ID] IN              SELECT [CID]               FROM [Pending] AS p              INNER JOIN [Current] ON [Current].[ID] like p.[CID]               WHERE p.[User]  admin           THEN 1            ELSE 0         END ASC,         [Current].[ID] ASC AS [RowID],      [Current].[ID],      CASE WHEN [Current].[ID] IN          SELECT [CID]           FROM [Pending] AS p       INNER JOIN [Current]  ON [Current].[ID] like p.[CID]           WHERE p.[User]  admin        THEN 1         ELSE 0      END AS [HasPending]  FROM [Current]  INNER JOIN [Current2] AS [Table2] ON [Current].[T2ID]  [Table2].[ID] SELECT [ResultPage].[RowID], [ResultPage].[HasPending], [Current2].[ID] As [Current2ID], [Tag].Name],  etc... etc...

Negative 4196 pThis is a weird IE quirk.

No other browser does this.

Normally passing in codetruecode would just return codetruecode but since codetruecode now has a method associated with it codetoJSONcode it is returning codefalsecode and breaking the widget.p  pI noticed there are some sites like Google that you can try to do the same test and codetrue.toJSONcode just breaks without returning anything.

Negative 4196 pMy question is about the solution seen in the post below... I think that is is a fantastic idea. Especially since Django has had the composite primary key issue for years. To me this is a great workaround given that you know the items in advance. However, this seems to have little feedback given that so many people have looked into composite keys in django. Can someone please point out the downside to this approachp  pI feel that as long as the salesperson has a unique ID you shouldnt have any hash collisions correct even if the years overlap. Additionally as long as you provide an index on the salesperson column you can perform fast select statements as this simulates the index automatically placed on a primary key.p  pHowever, I am clearly only seeing the positive, is there a danger with using this approach.p  pThank you for any info.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11375156compositeprimarykeygoogleappenginedjango1585386915853869Composite primary key, Google app engine djangoap

Its also   potentially dangerous to performance, because you can end up making   duplicate calls on associations unknowingly.  Instead, your controller   should only manage one instance variable  and perhaps a second for   the currentuser.  That way, all calls to associations are loaded on   demand, and can be instancevariablecached in a single place.p      pThis methodology also works out well for fragment caching, because you   can check caches in views before actually loading associations.p      pFor example, instead of having your Blog controller create an instance   variable for both post and relatedposts, just make a single method,   post, and give your Post model a relatedposts method, so you can   just call post.relatedposts in your views.p blockquote

So even if its updating at 20 or 30 fps, that means the sprite in my case a 100 x 80 px sprite is only going to move 20 or 30 pixels every second.  Is there a way to make it move fasterp  pHeres the dilemmap  pIf I change the speed of the sprite to 5, for example  that sounds great right  Move 5 pixels every update.  But it will be jittery  there is no smooth movement between draw calls, because its hopping 5 pixels each time.p  pSurely, there are enemies and NPCs in games made with canvas that move faster than the framerate rightp
Negative 4196 pI am working on a Spring RooApsectJ project at the moment. I am able to build a project and run it without any issues, implying AspectJ is doing correct weaving at compile time, however in Eclipses I seem to have no IDE support.  Any methods I am calling within the .aj files are being flagged as invalid as they cant be linked to the class through AspectJ, and my Cross References view is not working.p  pCould someone point me in the right direction as to what area of configuration I need to explore to get the IDE run time support of AspectJ working in Eclipse...as the compile time support is working fine.p  pAny ideas appreciated.p  pip

Imagine they are only members of the private phonebook of each user.pli lipstrongUserstrong This is a user again with fullname, email, telephone, and other contact details which can be created by Admins. They can create Contacts but NOT other Users, and they CAN login to the system. They also can and should be members of the Admins Phonebook.pli lipstrongAdminstrong This is a user again with fullname, email, telephone, and other contact details. They can create Users andor Contacts and of cource they can login to the system To keep things simple, lets say that these users are to be created through the submittion of a web formpli ol  pThe simplified attributes for them arep  pstrongContactstrong email, telephone, city, ownerid, dateinp  pstrongUserstrong email, telephone, city, ownerid, password, dateinp  pstrongAdminstrong email, telephone, city, password, dateinp  pthe database table users is something likep  ul liid autoincrementli liownerid ID of the user by whom this user was createdli lifullname textli liemail textli liphone textli licity textli liusertype Contact  User  Adminli lidatein datetime they signed upli lipassword if applicableli ul  pI an not sure wow I should use the inheritance... Is the following scheme correctp  precodeclass Contact   class User extends Contact   class Admin extends User  codepre  pSome other problems There should be a method in Admin and User that can create new users lets name it createuser. But each of them, should do different checks and allow for different options, and insert different type of things to the Database. What is the best practice to do so Write a generic to the parent class and call it through the subclasses and then update the entry from the subclasses with the extra data eg the Admins should also store the password to the databasep  pstrongUPDATEstrong maybe I was not clear enough...p  pThere is going to be PLENTY of common methods, irrelevant to the type of the user, and this is why I want inheritance.

Negative 4196 pIm loading several STL files one by one into the same scene. Those files are different LODs of the same model from lowpoly to highpoly. Id like to simulate a continuous model update from low to high resolution.p  pI tried to create a separate mesh for each LOD and add it to the scene when removing the previous one. Unfortunately, as the LODs get bigger, there is a significant delay in rendering. p  pSee the a hrefhttpsimonvz.github.ioWebglExswebglloaderbulkstlcane.html relnofollowexamplea and a hrefhttpsgithub.comSimonVZtreejs1blobmasterwebglloaderbulkstlcane.html relnofollowfull codeap  pMy questions   would it help if I just replace the geometry in the same mesh without recreating the mesh If so, how to force rendering update I tried to use codemesh.setGeometrycode, but it doesnt seems to work for STL geometry  the new geometry is shown perfectly works for Cube, for some reason.   is it possible to speed up the update somehow by any sort of precalculations or cachingp  pThanks a lot in advance for any hints.

Negative 4196 pI have a DAO method which accepts as a parameter a HashMap.p  pThe key in the HashMap is the name of the column to be searched.p  pThe String[] contains the potential values to be searched for.p  pIf the String array is of length 1, the where clause matches the exact value in the string array. If the String array is of length 2, the where clause looks for all values BETWEEN the two values in the string array.p  pIbatis does not seem to have a mechanism for determining the length of an array in the sqlMap xml file since length of arrays does not have a JavaBean gettersetter.p  pIs it possible in ibatis to conditionally detect the length of the string array and adjust the query to either an exact match or a BETWEEN statementp  pFor example, if the key is age and the value is 18, then all 18 year old users are returned. However, if the key is age and the values are 18 and 23, then all users between 18 and 23 are returned.p  pThe isEqual tag initially looked quite promising, but it does not work with array.length since it does not have a gettersetter. Can ibatis determine the length of an array in the sqlMapp  pThanks.p

Is there any way to get the imageData from a strongrenderTargetstrong is so, howp  pEdit1p  pHeres the code for script that i use for the htmlp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgtltheadgt

Negative 4196 pI have a list of IDs in an Excel spreadsheet. I have a macro with a loop to go through all these IDs, use each of them putting it in a link as a form parameter to get some data from an Internet Explorer page, and put the data retrieved onto the next column of the sheet. p  pIm using the DoEvents inside a loop while IE is busy and this is causing some data inconsistencies. Like thisp  precodeID   Data 12   John Smith, Likes football 13   George Wilson, Has a dog 14   George Wilson, Has a dog 15   Frank Peterson, Eats a lot codepre  pAs you can see, eventhough the correct ID is sent to IE, somehow it gets the data from the previous loop. All variables are reset to blank or empty for the next loop, the currentRow variable increases appropriately.p  pHere is part of the codep  precodesome code Dim ie As Object Dim peopleData As String Dim currentRow As Integer some code     Set ie  CreateObjectInternetExplorer.Application some code  loop code     With ie         Dont show window         ie.Visible  False         ie.Navigate httpswww.mypage.compage.phpid amp Sheet1.CellscurrentRow, 1          Dont show window         ie.Visible  False          Wait until IE is done loading page         Do While ie.Busy             Application.StatusBar  Downloading information, lease wait...             DoEvents         Loop           Make a string from IE content         Set mDoc  ie.Document         peopleData  mDoc.body.innerText         ActiveSheet.CellscurrentRow, currentCol  1.Value  peopleData      End With      peopleData   Nothing     Set mDoc  Nothing end of loop codepre  pThe first time I saw the inconsistencies I debugged the code and when debugging it was perfect everytime. It made me think that maybe somehow Excel was too quick or something and wrote the data before it actually got it from IE, hence the repetition of previous data. So I made sure all the variables were reset and I decided to change the DoEvents for a wait linep  precodeDo While ie.Busy     Application.StatusBar  Downloading information, lease wait...     Application.Wait DateAdds, 1, Now Loop codepre  pAnd it works without any problem. All that data is consistent. The huge downside is that it obviously takes one second for every row. With 30 rows the macro takes 30 seconds, which I can live with.

Negative 4196 pOkey, I solved this when i was just about to post here. I was looking for a way to distinguish between something like  codeevent Action testEvt1code and codeevent Action testEvt1  add   remove  code with reflection, since both end up as a pair of addtestEvt1 removetestEvt1 methods. Surprisingly, CompilerGeneratedAttribute does not help here. p  pThe solution turned out to be to look for private backing filed with the same name as the event  the compiler will only generate one for simple events and wont let you have other fields with the same name.p  pAs the code demonstrates  p  precodeclass Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      EventInfo evt1  typeofa.GetEventtestEvt1             EventInfo evt2  typeofa.GetEventtestEvt2              var evt1Attrib  Attribute.GetCustomAttributeevt1, typeofCompilerGeneratedAttribute             var evt2Attrib  Attribute.GetCustomAttributeevt2, typeofCompilerGeneratedAttribute              var evt1Backfield  typeofa.GetFieldevt1.Name,BindingFlags.NonPublic  BindingFlags.Instance             var evt2Backfield  typeofa.GetFieldevt2.Name, BindingFlags.NonPublic  BindingFlags.Instance                    public class a              private Action testEvt1         public event Action testEvt1         public event Action testEvt2                      add               remove                 codepre  pevt1Attrib and evt2Attrib both end up null. But the backing filed can only be found for the simple testEvt1, not testEvt2. p  pI decided to post this if anyone else happens to have same problem and maybe ask, does anyone know an easier way to distinguis testEvt1 from testEvt2 and why the compiler does not add CompilerGeneratedAttribute to add and remove methods for events Id like to know of a method that does not rely on backing field naming rules that may be changed in the future.p

Negative 4196 pAt the server side, we use p  precodeSocket server  serverSocket.accept codepre  pto create a socket. After the socket is created, we can create a new thread to handle the inputoutput stream of that socket. So we can go back to listening at the same port and create new socket if there are further connection requests come in. Since we already created ServerSocket at a specific port, of course we could not create another ServerSocket at that port again. p  pSo from my understanding, can I conclude that, at server side, we can create multiple sockets under one port similar to what web server doesp  pActually my question is, at client side, when we are creating a socket, we can specify the local port that we want to use. After we have successful created a client socket at that local port, can we reuse that port for other client socket Does that port bind to the socket permenantly until the socket is closed or port close Since there is no Listening concept at client side, are we able to do the same thing as ServerSocket does refer to ServerSocket can create multiple socket under one portp  pI am seriously confused how client side handle the port and socket, because I am comparing ServerSocket with the client socket. p  pPlease point me to the correct direction, I know that my thinking somehow is wrong.

Next there is another thread which is making a call for the model WSDL file loading and there  Classloader 2 is doing the loading. then we wee the below code in org.eclipse.wst.wsdl.internal.impl.MessageImpl fails with Nullpointer exceptionp  pPart part  WSDLPackageEPackage.Registry.INSTANCE.getEPackageWSDLPackage.eNSURI.getWSDLFactory.createPartp  pSo it is clear that with two class loaders we cannot initialize the EMF models if the first time the EMF classes are loaded because second time the isInited is true and initialization is not done.

Negative 4196 pI have a Joomla site and have a PHP script in it. There is a button that redirects people to PHP script. I want to use my Joomla site user groups as access levels. those who are strongnotstrong logged in should be prevented from accessing the emindex.phpem of the PHP script and receive a message such as emyou must login firstem and those that strongarestrong logged in, can access to the emindex.phpem of the PHP script.p  pThe thing that I did was that include the Joomla framework at the top of emindex.phpem of PHP script and put the function codeJFactorygetUsercode. After that I put the whole emindex.phpem in an codeifelsecode condition.

But as I increased the complexity and map size, it becomes very inefficient to load the same image hundreds of times.p  pI arrived at the state of the code above from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2808501callingouterclassfunctionfrominnerclassthisa answer. p  pI believe I would have to put codeResourceLoader.classcode and codePlayer.classcode inside the codegame.classcode, which would not be a good solution considering that there are about 20 files that need this treatment and most of them are 200 lines long.p  pI think my codeTexturecode object as well as initialization of OpenGL and other stuff are pretty generic and should not impact the issue in question. I can provide these if necessary.p

Negative 4196 pI am developing a webapp for mobile phones. There is one xhtml page, where I want to show a picture, which is stored locally on my hard drive for example Dpicturestest.jpg. Since browsers block images when they are located on a local harddrive, I wrote a method in my javabean, where the picture, stored on the localHD, is copied to the webApp directory, when the user enters the xhtml page. After the user leaves the page, the copied file inside the webapp should be deleted. So when Im running my app, copying works perfectly and the pictures are displayed correctly. However, when the files should get deleted, I get this errormessagep  blockquote   pjava.nio.file.FileSystemException DWebAppPathsrcmainwebappresourcespicstest.jpg    The process cannot be accessed because the file is being used by another process.p blockquote  pStrangely enough, after stopping and restarting the application I can delete the same image if it is still in the webApp directory. But Only once after recopying it, I get the error message again.p  pAlso if I want to delete the file manually, by using Windows explorer, I get the error message that the file cant be deleted because it is used by JavaTM Platform SE Binary. p  pSo to delete the file manually or via the bean I have to wait for a restart of the application, which of course is not an acceptable solution for the end user.p  pIm using JSF2.0 with Primefaces and Primefaces Mobile components.

Negative 4196 pI am developing a drag and drop calendar for my website. whereby the user can drag existing date blocks to different times and days. What Im having trouble with is finding a relativly simple way of figuring out if, when the block is droppedon the mouseup event whether the block partially or totally eclipses an existing date block, in which case the block should move back to its mousedown position.Basically I need to find a way to map all the available free area inside the container divthat is all areas where date blocks are not positioned and if the whole of the dragged div does not exceed this area then allow the drop otherwise move it back to its mousedown position.

This info will then be written onto the console from said array. p  pUnfortunately, in attempting to write anything to the structs in the array, I get 2 errors. Cannot convert from const char[8] to char [30] and no operator [] matches these operands, operand types are CountryStats [int]. These errors both refer to the linep  precodecountries[0].countryName  A codepre  pKeep in mind that I have only started to use structs and this is the first time Ive used them in an array. Also, I must use an array, as opposed to a vector.p  pHeres my codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltfstreamgt include ltstringgt include ltvectorgt  struct CountryStats void initArrayCountryStats countries  const int MAXRECORDS  100 const int MAXNAMELENGTH  30  struct CountryStats      char countryName[MAXNAMELENGTH]     int population     int area     double density     All code beneath this line has been giving me trouble. I need to easily edit the   struct variables and then read them. int mainvoid      CountryStats countries[MAXRECORDS]     initArraycountries   void initArrayCountryStats countries      countries[0].countryName  A  codepre  pAs of now I am just attempting to figure out how to write information to a struct within the array and then read the information off of it onto the console. Everything else should fall into place after I find the solution to this.p  pOh, and one final note I have not quite learned the function of pointers  yet. I am still relatively new to C as my past programming education has been primarily in Java. Any and all inclusions of pointers in this code have been influenced by my classmates and professor in the pursuit of solving this problem.p  pThanks in advancep

Common words like how, I, You, should, could... are not part of WordNet.p  pIs there any python module that gives access to a full english dictionary including definitions of wordsp

Now the catch is the swipable tab layout works only with class that extend Fragment and not Fragment Activity as per my knowledge. p  pAlso if I make my class to extend Fragment in place of fragmentActivity then I am restricted to use some methods which are necessary for my app. p  pSo Can anyone suggest what to do in such scenario where I want to swipe between FragmentActivity class and not Fragmentp

Negative 4196 pWe had a problem that took us one week to solve. It was because a function ddot was declared in a fortran program in static .a archive as well as in a C program in .so dynamic library. The linker ld linked to the wrong entry.p  pIt turned out that the problem was solved when the fortran function was renamed from ddot to ddotsparse. But it took us one week to find that.p  pWould it be possible to do this kind of detection automatically As a matter of fact the linker accepted for the ddot from fortran and the ddot from the C library as legitimate. Could this be reported by the linkerp  pOr maybe it is a bug of ld that such things are not detected The man page of ld says Normally when a symbol is defined multiple times, the linker will report a fatal error. This clearly did not happen here.p  pAlternatively, are there tools to show up the tree of dependency between the various symbols of a binary executable That would be wonderfully useful. Something that shows for each symbol the used symbol and the file from which they originate.p

One solution Ive considered is to repeat the codeparentcode id in all the children tablesp  precodecreate table child2    id int,   parentid int not null references parentid,   child1id int not null references child1id,   e text,   f text   create table child3    id int,   parentid int not null references parentid,   child2id int not null references child2id,   g text,   h text  codepre  pThis helps reduce the number of joins, but it also affects database integrity.

Negative 4196 pI am implementing a solution that has a web interface service stack and a long running job service servicestack.p  pI already implemented the web interface and found servicestack a really good framework for creating what i wanted. I used redis as a semi reliable object store.p  pThen i started to think about how to implement the job service. What i originally thought i do was to set up a simple windows service and have the redis client pick up thinks marked for the job service  how exactly i wasnt sure . These are very long running jobs that require alot of resources so i want to throttle how many of them are running at a time and also if i could fan out with worker machines that would be nice.p  pThen i saw that ServiceStack has a RedisMQ that might fit the bill, and hence the question.p  pShould i create a seperate servicestack service and host it in a windows service. Then have a MQ interface on it and let the webservice post to that message queue jobs that need to run. Then the jobservice is decoulpled from the webservice and all is well.p  porp  pAm i over thinking it and should just use the logic part of the service i already have running and implement the job logic there, could pop in a MQ but in the same process that would probably just be a waste of time. I could skip the message part entirely and just call the logic part straight with some throttling algorithm.p  pAlso when i was testing this out i had trouble with creating the RedisMQ serverp  precodeusing ServiceStack.redis using ServiceStack.messaging var mqHost  new RedisMqServerredisFactory, retryCount2 codepre  pReturns RedisMQServer not found.p  pI did a full nuget install of the servicestack and servicestack.redis packagesp  precodeinstallpackage servicestack installpackage servicestack.redis codepre  pWhen i use object browser on the .dll i dont find any mention of the ReidsMQServer, the version i 4.0.15 I found this url a hrefhttpsgithub.comServiceStackServiceStackblobmastersrcServiceStack.ServerMessagingRedisRedisMqServer.cs relnofollowhttpsgithub.comServiceStackServiceStackblobmastersrcServiceStack.ServerMessagingRedisRedisMqServer.csa And would think that this should belong to the servicestack.redis reference.p  pAny help appreciated, cheersp

Negative 4196 pRecently, I started working on a cluster to speed up my work. Currently my job is to profile a code with input data of different sizes. Previously I was doing that in a codeforcode loop for every input file. On the cluster I use MPI to run the program with each different input as a different process.p  pThe source code of the MPI script can be found below. It runs the different processes and there is also a server process that writes out the results, to avoid a situation where two processes would write out simultaneously to the output file. As the code is structured now, I can only access the output if all processes end on time. This is a problem because I try to keep the walltime of my job as low as possible to get the job started fast the cluster is constantly full, so its difficult to get the job started if I require too many resources. So sometimes my job gets interrupted by the scheduler prematurely.p  pMy idea was to add a timer in the server process and if the current walltime gets close to the maximum two minutes in the code below, to close the file stream. In this way, at least I wont lose the data that was already collected. This however will not work, as the timer only gets updated when the server receives new data. Opening the file only when the server receives new data should be avoided, as I prefer to start with an empty output file each time I commit the job. What other options are available to ensure that I do not lose the output that was already collectedp  precodeinclude ltmpi.hgt define RES 1  int mainint argc, char argv[]    int nprocs, myid, server, ndone   double WallTime   struct timeval start, end   double countTime, res[4]   FILE fpt    WallTime  16059    MPIComm world   MPIGroup worldgroup   MPIStatus status   MPIInitampargc, ampargv   world  MPICOMMWORLD   MPICommsizeworld,ampnprocs   MPICommrankworld,ampmyid   server  nprocs1  last proc is server    MPICommgroupworld, ampworldgroup    ifmyid  server  I store the output      ndone  0     fpt  fopenargv[2],wt     gettimeofdayampstart, NULL     do       MPIRecvres, 4, MPIDOUBLE, MPIANYSOURCE, RES, world, ampstatus       fprintffpt,dt10.7ft10.7ftldn, int res[0], res[1], res[2], long int res[3]       gettimeofdayampend, NULL       countTime  end.tvsecend.tvusec1.e6start.tvsecstart.tvusec1.e6       ndone      while ndone lt nprocs1 ampamp countTime lt WallTime     fclosefpt    else ifmyidltnprocs1     do sth with data according to myid ...

Negative 4196 pI want to use execl in child process after doing fork. execl will execute the script which will take around 120 seconds of time. I tried almost all the combination with waitpid, wait and waitid with different argument 0, WNOHANG, etc., but in all case I am getting 1 return value.

Negative 4196 pI have Linux compute server A on which I would like to execute an application, say HV I use this HV application to render a CAE model and capture the image. Eventhough I run this HV in batch mode, from putty terminal, it requires X windows. That is I need to run Xming and forward the display from server A, else it exits with error No valid fonts  exiting. In this case I am connecting to server A from my windows laptop using puttyp  pInstead of using Xming, the workaround I use is Xvfb. This works great in 90 of the cases. In the remaining 10 cases, few of the objects are not rendered in the captured image file.p  pIs there any alternate to Xvfb. There are few mention on net about Xdummy, but not much details. Or, it there any way to pass the relevant font, without forwarding the displayp  pMy actual use case is, I have web application running on another Linux server, let us call it Server B. When I trigger the event from the client browser, the Server B connects to Linux Server A via ssh and executes the HV application. Even in this scenario, I tried ssh X instead of just ssh for the connection between B and A. Still the application is exiting error No valid fonts  exiting if I dont use Xvfb.p

Negative 4196 pIm working in a company where we are creating a web app, and we are moving all the legacy Yii PHP controllers to a more dynamic style.p  pInstead of generate HTML with PHP, the app its moving to ask data to the java private API and receive JSON to generate HTML elements with Javascript, but there still are elements generated in the PHP code.p  pMy question is is it viable to use the server code php, ruby, java... just to generate some data in json and then create everything via javascript once its received maybe everything but body, head tags Pp  pPros consp  pIf its not a bad idea, is there any tips Frameworks like dust.js, backbone... advicesp  pWhy should I continue with this idea or why get away from itp  pstrongEditstrong Examplep  pA php generated page from Yii framework using MVC as said  so not mixing backend and frontend with the basic information like page header, side menu, footer, and some content without functionality. Once this page is received, the js takes control and adds extra functionality, rightp  pThe other point is The same page but PHP not rendering anything but codelthtmlgtltbodygtltbodygtlthtmlgtcode just the basic stuff, maybe something more like including js files, some headers... you know, the minimum needed AND setting some javascript variables using JSON objects, with all the information needed by javascript to render the header, menu, body, etc. So the pattern will be close to the onepage design by js as backbone, angular.js, etc..p

Negative 4196 pEDIT Ive decided to go with Restangular since it seems that the Lodash library plays pretty well with AngularJS. I still have one more question. Restangulars getList function expects the response to be an array however my server responses include two parameters, only one of which is an array. Something like thisp  precodeerror false, topics [id1, titlesomeTitle,id2, titlesomeTitle2] codepre  pI assume I would set this in the RestangularProvider.setResourceInterceptor but Im not quite sure how. Any options I was able to read the response from a .json file which I made an array so at least I know Im reading it right. p  pUPDATE I tried this but i get TypeError Cannot set property metadata of undefinedp  precodeRestangularProvider.addResponseInterceptorfunction data, operation, what, url, response, deferred    var newResponse    This is a get for a list   if operation  getList       First the newResponse will be response.topics which is actually an array     newResponse  response.topics      Then we add to this array a special property containing the metadata for paging for example     newResponse.metadata  response.data.meta    else       If its an element, then we just return the regular response as theres no object wrapping it    newResponse  response      return newResponse  codepre  pltp  pIm pretty new to angularJS and still unsure about several things regarding CRUD operations. Ive heard a lot of praise for ngResource but also suggestions that http was better for more complex model relations. I have a specific problem here and I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction. For this example I opted for using ngResource, though Im not too sure how much I like its data handling. I have two resources on my Api, topics and comments. The Api endpoints are as followsp  precodehttpapi.example.comv1topics To get all topics httpapi.example.comv1topicsid To get a single topic httpapi.example.comv1topicsidcomments To get all comments for a single topic codepre  pIve written the following code to get the topicsp  precodeapp.controllermainController, functionscope, resource, location, http, localStorageService, requestNotification     var Topic  resourcehttpapi.discussorama.comv1topicsid, id id,      query          isArray false,         method GET,         headers XApiSecret xxx, Authorization xxx, ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded            var topics  Topic.query   topics.promise.thenfunctiondata     scope.topics  data.topics      codepre  pAnd then used it in my view like this no problems yetp  precodeltdiv ngrepeatt in topics  orderBycreatedattrue classtopicgt   ltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classcolmd6 topicbodygt       lth3 classtopictitlegt t.topictitle lth3gt       lth5 classtopicsubtitlegtPosted by  t.name lth5gt       lthrgt       ltimg ngsrc t.imageurl  classimgresponsivegt       ltp classtopiccontentgt t.topiccontent ltpgt       ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolmd6gt       ltimg ngsrc t.profilepic  width60pxgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt   lthrgt ltdivgt codepre  pWhat Id like to do now is query the comments Api endpoint within the ngrepeat of the topics to display the comments for that particular topic. Is there a way to pass t.id from the ngrepeat to replace the id in a hrefhttpapi.example.comtopics3aidcomments relnofollowhttpapi.example.comtopicsidcommentsa and how would I go about this.

Negative 4196 pI need to implement a backup solution for virtual machines runnin on Windows Server 2008 R2 using Powershell and PSHyperV module. The module helps loads, as it provides an easy way to get VM properties and other stuff, perform basic functions, etc. p  pI plan for the least downtime scenario, as the VMs in question are potentially used by clients, and they usually dont tolerate any downtime. I am aware that using Windows Server 2012 R2 hypervisor solves this problem altogether because it has live VHD merge functionality, but migration of infrastructure is a long enough process and backups dont wait. p  pCurrently, the backups are done via codesave VM gt copy tree gt start VMcode process, which involves up to 6h downtime for the biggest VM. I am planning to use VM snapshots to lessen the downtime, as once you have performed a snapshot, you can back up the VHDs and the snapshot data elsewhere without disturbing the VM itll be slower, but thats all. Then I plan to save the VM, remove the snapshot VHD merge will occur, wait until merging will complete, then start the VM, potentially reducing the VM downtime to half an hour worst case.p  pSo far my script is able to locate VHDs of a given VM, back them up, but is unable to find the VMs snapshots location. It is possible that just traversing the tree from VHDs folder backwards will not yield me neither Virtual Machines nor Snapshots folder, so guessing is out of option. p  pHow do I get the location of snapshot files in order to do a manual export for the VM snapshotp

Negative 4196 pI am working on a WPF 4.5 application which needs to interact with PDFs and I am stuck with an issue as described belowp  pI have template pdfs stored at a specific location. Based on requirement, a copy of the template pdf is created. This pdf has certain fields including text boxes, dropdowns etc. Some of these fields need to be prepopulated like the dropdown values.  Once it is ready, I need to open it, and let the user complete the form. Once completed, the user saves the file and closes it. p  pNow I need to read the file and send the updated data to the DB. I was able to do all this using iTextSharp by launching the PDF in a separate process and handling the Exited event. Now, the problem I face is this solution does not work if the user uses the SaveAs option to change the name or location of the opened file.p  pI thought if it would be possible to disable the Save options and add a button on the form clicking which would automatically save the form and close it at the expected location would be a possible solution.p  pMy questions arep  p1 Is it possible to find out using the argument of the Exited event handler to find out the saved file name and location As soon as the user saves the file with a different name, the title of the reader gets updated with the current file name. So I am assuming that the current process is using the latest file.br 2 Is it possible to disable the SaveAs and Save file options and close the file on click of a button in the form, using Adobe SDK JavaScript or plugin or APIbr 3 If I use the Adobe SDK, do all the systems on which the application would be installed need to have a licensed version of the Adobe Acrobatp  pIf the above options are not possible then we would have to settle with dynamic forms. We wanted to experiment with PDF since it is easy to create, and supports image annotations, for which we might need to develop a separate solution, if the above options are not feasible.p  pI know this is not a very specific programming question, but I need help in order to be able to figure out which path I can go on to be able to achieve the goal. p  pPlease mark duplicate with the link to the other SO question if it a duplicate since I have not been able to figure out one.br Would appreciate answers, links to other posts on SO that are specific to the questions asked.br Please avoid opinion based answers.br Any help would be appreciated.br Any constructive criticism is also welcome.p

Negative 4196 pI am working on an application that will be using Audio quite heavily and I am in the research stages of deciding whether to use Web Audio API on devices that can support it.

Furthermore the 600kb MP3 turns out to use 8090MB of memory when decoded.p  pMy question is  When decoding audio data using Web Audio API, why is the memory usage so big and also why is the memory never reclaimed From my understanding the decoding is an async operation for the browser and so presumably happens on a separate thread Is it possible the browsers separate thread is never releasing the memory used during decodingp  pMy code is below, any helpexplanation is greatly appreciatedp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt lthead langengt     ltmeta charsetUTF8gt     lttitlegtWeb Audio Playgroundlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltbutton idloadgt     Load ltbuttongt ltbutton idplaygt     Play ltbuttongt ltbutton idpausegt     Pause ltbuttongt ltbutton iddestroygt     Destroy ltbuttongt ltscript typeapplicationjavascriptgt     function           window.AudioContext  window.AudioContext  window.webkitAudioContext          var loadButton  document.getElementByIdload,                 playButton  document.getElementByIdplay,                 pauseButton  document.getElementByIdpause,                 destroyButton  document.getElementByIddestroy,                 audioContext  new window.AudioContext,                 soundBuffer  null,                 soundSource  null          loadButton.addEventListenerclick, function               var request  new XMLHttpRequest             request.openGET, livesprite.mp3, true             request.responseType  arraybuffer               Decode asynchronously             request.onload  function                   audioContext.decodeAudioDatarequest.response, function buffer                      soundBuffer  buffer                                           request.send                   playButton.addEventListenerclick, function               soundSource  audioContext.createBufferSource             soundSource.buffer  soundBuffer             soundSource.connectaudioContext.destination             soundSource.start0                   pauseButton.addEventListenerclick, function               if soundSource                  soundSource.stop0                                destroyButton.addEventListenerclick, function               if soundSource                  soundSource.disconnect0                 soundSource  null                 soundBuffer  null                 alertdestroyed                             ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 4196 pA recurring error I run into when using NumPy is that an attempt to index an array fails because one of the dimensions of the array was a singleton, and thus that dimension got wiped out and cant be indexed.  This is especially problematic in functions designed to operate on arrays of arbitrary size.  Im looking for the cheapest, most universal way to avoid this error. p  pHeres an example p  precodeimport numpy as np f  lambda t, u, i0 t[,i]u[1] a  np.eye3 b  np.array[1,2,3] fa,b fa[,0],b[1] codepre  pThe first call works as expected.  The second call fails in two ways 1 codetcode cant be indexed by code[,0]code because is has shape code3,code, and 2 codeucode cant be indexed at all because its a scalar.p  pHere are the fixes that occur to mep  p1 Use codenp.atleast1dcode and codenp.atleast2dcode etc. possibly with conditionals to make sure that the dimensions are in the right order inside codefcode to make sure that all parameters have the dimensions they need.  This precludes use of lambdas, and can take a few lines that I would rather not need. p  p2 Instead of writing codefa[,0],b[1]code above, use codefa[,[0]],b[[1]]code.  This is fine, but I always have to remember to put in the extra brackets, and if the index is stored in a variable you might not know if you should put the extra brackets in or not.  E.g. p  precodeidx  1 fa[,[0]],b[[idx]] idx  [2,0,1] fa[,[0]],b[idx] codepre  pIn this case, you would seem to have to call codenp.atleast1dcode on codeidxcode first, which may be even more cumbersome than putting codenp.atleast1dcode in the function.p  p3 In some cases I can get away with just not putting in an index.  E.g.p  precodef  lambda t, u t[0]u fa,b fa[,0],b[0] codepre  pThis works, and is apparently the slickest solution when it applies.  But it doesnt help in every case in particular, your dimensions have to be in the right order to begin with.p  pSo, are there better approaches than the abovep

Negative 4196 pIm certain it is possible to have a repository return objects of various data types. We have an inhouse API that returns student test scores for different types of tests. My assignment is to get those scores, transform them to a standard model and then import the scores into a student information system using another API. Currently I am working on the part of importing the scores. My plan is to have a processor for each test type that will import, transform and load the scores. There is a repository that will pull the scores from the API and return them to the processor. Below I have working code that does that for the Reading scores. But I also have 4 other types of scores, each having a slightly different model, and may eventually have more.p  pBelow is code that works for the Reading scores, my question is  how can I reuse this repository to return the differenty score models without writing a Task for each score type p  pHere is what I THINK Ive figured out so far.

For 6 elements, the collection view looks pretty standard where o represents a circlebr o o obr o o o  p  pI do not want them to be laid out as such for every number lower than 6. I want them to be centered.

So, as you can see from above, I want the layout to change based on the number of elements in the data source of the collection view. The number of elements will never exceed 6. p  pAdditionally, the user might be able to edit one of these profiles, in which a  icon will appear, making the collection view appear with the n1 layout. For example, a user editing a profile with 4 elements will look at a collection view layout as if it had 5 elements, the fifth one being a  sign to add another element. A user will only be able to delete elements from a profile that already has 6 elements.p  pInitially, I was thinking of using a bunch of if and switch statements based on the indexPath.row of the collection view and the number of elements in the data source. But, that seems sloppy. Is there a way to do this using a custom UICollectionViewFlowLayout Either way, how would one go about implementing such a layoutp  pThanks for any advice in advance. Sorry that this question is long, and I can provide clarification wherever necessary.p

Negative 4196 pI am very, very memory careful as I have to write programs that need to cope with massive datasets.p  pCurrently my application quickly reaches 32GB of memory, starts swapping, and then gets killed by the system.p  pI do not understand how this can be since all variables are collectable in functions and quickly released except codeTokensStructcode and codeTokensCountcode in the codeTrainercode struct. codeTokensCountcode is just a uint. codeTokensStructcode is a 1,000,000 row slice of [5]uint32 and string, so that means 20 bytes  string, which we could call a maximum of 50 bytes per record. 501000000  50MB of memory required. So this script should therefore not use much more than 50MB  overhead  temporary collectable variables in the functions maybe another 50MB max. The maximum potential size of codeTokensStructcode is 5,000,000, as this is the size of codedictionarycode, but even then it would be only 250MB of memory. codedictionarycode is a map and apparently uses around 600MB of memory, as that is how the app starts, but this is not an issue because codedictionarycode is only loaded once and never written to again.p  pInstead it uses 32GB of memory then dies. By the speed that it does this I expect it would happily get to 1TB of memory if it could. The memory appears to increase in a linear fashion with the size of the files being loaded, meaning that it appears to never clear any memory at all. Everything that enters the app is allocated more memory and memory is never freed.p  pI tried implementing coderuntime.GCcode in case the garbage collection wasnt running often enough, but this made no difference.p  pSince the memory usage increases in a linear fashion then this would imply that there is a memory leak in codeGetTokenscode or codeLoadZipcode. I dont know how this could be, since they are both functions and only do one task and then close. Or it could be that the codetokenscode variable in codeStartcode is the cause of the leak. Basically it looks like every file that is loaded and parsed is never released from memory, as that is the only way that the memory could fill up in a linear fashion and keep on rising up to 32GB.p  pAbsolute nightmare Whats wrong with Go Any way to fix thisp  precodepackage main  import      bytes     code.google.compgo.texttransform     code.google.compgo.textunicodenorm     compresszlib     encodinggob     fmt     github.comAlasdairFBinSearch     ioioutil     os     regexp     runtime     strings     unicode     unicodeutf8   type TokensStruct struct      binsearch.Keystring     Value [][5]uint32   type Trainer struct      Tokens      TokensStruct     TokensCount uint   func checkErrerr error      if err  nil          return          fmt.PrintlnSome Error, err     panicerr    Local helper function for normalization of UTF8 strings. func isMnr rune bool      return unicode.Isunicode.Mn, r  Mn nonspacing marks    This map is used by RemoveAccents function to convert nonaccented characters. var transliterations  map[rune]string E,  D,  L,  OE,  Th,  ss,  e,  d,  l,  oe,  th,  OE,  oe    removeAccentsBytes converts accented UTF8 characters into their nonaccented equivalents, from a []byte. func removeAccentsBytesDashesb []byte []byte, error      mnBuf  make[]byte, lenb     t  transform.Chainnorm.NFD, transform.RemoveFuncisMn, norm.NFC     n, , err  t.TransformmnBuf, b, true     if err  nil          return nil, err          mnBuf  mnBuf[n]     tlBuf  bytes.NewBuffermake[]byte, 0, lenmnBuf2     for i, w  0, 0 i lt lenmnBuf i  w          r, width  utf8.DecodeRunemnBuf[i]         if r                tlBuf.WriteByte           else              if d, ok  transliterations[r] ok                  tlBuf.WriteStringd              else                  tlBuf.WriteRuner                               w  width          return tlBuf.Bytes, nil   func LoadZipfilename string []byte, error       Open file for reading     fi, err  os.Openfilename     if err  nil          return nil, err          defer fi.Close      Attach ZIP reader     fz, err  zlib.NewReaderfi     if err  nil          return nil, err          defer fz.Close      Pull     data, err  ioutil.ReadAllfz     if err  nil          return nil, err          return norm.NFC.Bytesdata, nil  return normalized   func getTokenspibn string []string      var data []byte     var err error     data, err  LoadZipstoredir  pibn  text.zip     checkErrerr     data, err  removeAccentsBytesDashesdata     checkErrerr     data  bytes.ToLowerdata     data  reg2.ReplaceAlldata, []byte2  remove contractions     data  reg.ReplaceAllLiteraldata, nil     tokens  strings.Fieldsstringdata     return tokens   func t Trainer Start      data, err  ioutil.ReadFilelist.txt     checkErrerr     pibns  bytes.Fieldsdata     for i, pibn  range pibns          tokens  getTokensstringpibn         t.addTokenstokens         if i100  0              runtime.GC  I added this just to try to stop the memory craziness, but it makes no difference                 func t Trainer addTokenstokens []string      for , tok  range tokens          if , ok  dictionary[tok] ok              if indx, ok2  t.Tokens.Findtok ok2                  ar  t.Tokens.Value[indx]                 ar[0]                 t.Tokens.Value[indx]  ar                 t.TokensCount              else                  t.Tokens.AddKeyAttok, indx                 t.Tokens.Value  appendt.Tokens.Value, [5]uint320, 0, 0, 0, 0                 copyt.Tokens.Value[indx1], t.Tokens.Value[indx]                 t.Tokens.Value[indx]  [5]uint321, 0, 0, 0, 0                 t.TokensCount                                return   func LoadDictionary      dictionary  makemap[string]bool     data, err  ioutil.ReadFiledictionary     checkErrerr     words  bytes.Fieldsdata     for , word  range words          strword  stringword         dictionary[strword]  false        var reg  regexp.MustCompile[az09s] var reg2  regexp.MustCompilebclalldalldellnellsullcollpellglagldagldeglneglsuglunmtsvdqunj[az] contractions var dictionary map[string]bool  func main      trainer  newTrainer     LoadDictionary     trainer.Start  codepre
Negative 4196 pI have multiple tasks that will be running in parallel. They are gathered in a list of tasks. Each task has a progress bar associated with it.

Negative 4196 pI am trying to implement an drag to sort function on this a hrefhttpbit.ly1q3itLo relnofollowpagea. On the right side there are thumbnails which I want to be able to order. I thought to use jQuerys sortable in codejQuery UIcode. But it seems to be a bit odd since my thumbnails are scaled through codeCSScode and then it does not work correctly. p  pNow I have made something what is basically. When I have a mouse down event on a thumbnail, I clone it hide the original and put the cloned element where my mouse is. But now when I hover while having the cloned element under my cursor over another thumbnail the hover event is not fired for that thumbnail. p  pIs there another way to determine if my cursus is above a certain element in the codeDOMcode E.g so I can detect that the cursor is above another thumbnail while dragging a thumbnail. p

Retrieves back name of file to user  p  pThe problem is that main scripts strongVirtualstrong memory used column is growing up within time. Code is pretty simple and it feels that theres no chance it can be memory leak related anyhow. All the references to variables are deleted manually just incase. On extraction part in step 3 memoryprofiler shows memory usage increase when dealing with reading from file, however, all the references to file should be collected by garbage collector at the end of procedure. Heapy doesnt show any new allocations in there at all.br However, when using subprocessing version of script where each client has its own version of strongmainstrong, theres no problem at all guess since its instance dies upon ending.   p  pI tried to run script separate from twistd with local test files just python scriptname. Running 10 requests provides different virtual memory used depending on order of requests and size of files.

Negative 4196 pI have a Rails app that Im going to start putting on different servers.  Each server the codebase will be slightly different Logo change, small feature changes, etc.  Im working off of one github repo and was wondering what the best way to manage this is.p  pMy initial thought process was to create a github account for each app instance so I can maintain different instances off the app.  So for instance have a github account for server1instance1 and another for server2instance2.p  pMy other thought process was to clone the current codebase, push it to a new github account, and rename it, and add the proper git remote credentials and ssh keys to pushpull properly.p  pBasically Im trying to maintain the same app on multiple servers but with small changes to each app instance again, Logo, small feature changes, etc.p  pWhat is the best way to manage something like thisp  pIf my question is not clear, please let me know and Ill be happy to explain.p

Negative 4196 pThis is a continuation of my work on a gradebook program.  I have been posting my questions related to JSON and connecting two applications to StackOverflow because Ive been having a really difficult time with that part.  p  pI have been attempting to create an HTTP POST request that uses JSON for the purpose of sending information from a Java gradebook application to a Rails webbased application that displays those grades in the form of a report to students.  p  pUltimately, I want to send more than just one students information. Furthermore, each student might have anywhere from 0 to 50 assignments, descriptions of the assignments, as well as grades for those assignments. On top of that there will be multiple classescourses of students. All this information needs to be read in to the JSON object. Does anyone have any suggestions about how I could modify this code so that I could send all that data  The farthest that I was able to take the JSONrelated part of code is shown below.  However, that code needs to be modified as the following questions suggest. 1.   How do I create the array of JSON objects dynamically rather than how it is shown below since the courses, students, and grades will vary and be read in from the Java program 2.  How do I synthesizecombine the three JSON arrays of objects below to make it work  My idea is that I write the array of course objects then somehow embed  the array of student objects as part of each course object, then somehow embed the array of grade objects as part of each student object.p  precode JSONArrayOfCourseObjects  [courseID  Botany101FallSemester, courseInstructor     Mr.  Smith, courseID  Physics101FallSemester, courseInstructor  Mrs. Newton,     etc.]   JSONArrayOfStudentObjects  [Name  John Doe, StudentID  12345678, Address    1234 Main Street, Name  Don Corleone, StudentID  87654321, Address     121 Walberry Ave, etc.]   JSONArrayOfGradeObjects  [nameOfAssignment  Irrigation Homework 1,    dateOfAssignment  Sept 1, 2014, categoryOfAssignment  Homework,    nameOfAssignment  Test 1, dateOfAssignment  Sept 14, 2014, categoryOfAssignment     Test, etc.] codepre

Negative 4196 pIm building an API using rails for the backend of an ember webapp.  We have a model named Palette which has many colors associated with it.  Due to the way the ember app is built, we are deleting the colors and replacing them with new objects whenever the palette is updated.  The challenge is that if the new state of the colors is no longer valid, we have already deleted the old colors and cannot return to the original state.  The only solution we have so far is to create a transaction in our update method of the palette controller which will throw an exception if any of the new color creations fails or the palette fails.  While this solution works, it feels a bit clunky.  Is there a more elegant solution availablep  precodeclass PalettesController lt BaseController    def update     ActiveRecordBase.transaction do       begin         palette  Palette.find params[id]         palette.destroycolors         params[palette][colors].each do color         Color.create palette palette,                      name color[name],                      cmyk color[cmyk],                     colortype color[colortype]         end         return render json palette.errors,            status unprocessableentity unless palette.save       rescue         return render json  error Unable to process the request .tojson,            status unprocessableentity       end       render json palette, status 200     end   end  end  codepre

Negative 4196 pI have a codeUITableViewcode with custom codeUITableViewCellscode and each tableview cell has a codeUITextFieldcode.  By default the textfield has a title already in place that can be edited by the user.  The default title in the textfield is associated with a file in codeNSFileManagercode and when the user finishes editing the text field and taps return, a method that changes the file name to what the user enters gets called.  This works fine, but when the user taps the textfield but doesnt do any editing and then taps back to go to the previous view controller, I get a warning from NSFileManager saying the file name already exists.  This doesnt cause any problems, but its annoying.  I know the method that calls NSFileManager to change the file name shouldnt get called unless the user edits the textfield, but Im not sure of the best way to implement this.  p  pI saw this post, but wasnt sure how to incorporate it into what Im doing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7010547uitextfieldtextchangeeventUITextField text change eventap  pI was wondering if someone could give me some tips on how to make this work.   p  precodevoid textFieldDidEndEditingUITextField textField      textField.delegate  self      NSArray cells  [self.audioTable visibleCells]     for OSAudioTableCell cell in cells              if textField  cell.textField                      NSInteger index  cell.tag               NSIndexPath indexPath  [NSIndexPath indexPathForRowindex inSection0]             Recording  recording  [self.fetchCon objectAtIndexPathindexPath]              NSString  previousPath  recording.audioURL              I left a lot out, but this is where I call the method to change the file name             NSString  returnedURL  [self.managedDocument changeFileNamepreviousPath withNewComponenttextField.text errorampaError]                  codepre

Negative 4196 pI am currently working with the 3rd party library SCRecorder to try and create an AVAsset with a URL and then create an AVPlayerItem  AVPlayer to output a video. p  pI believe my problem arises because the video data I am trying to play is originally being saved to Parse as a raw data file. The reference URL to this file is in the format http files.parsetfss.comsomethingfile. It does not appear that there is a way to create an AVAsset, and ultimately an AVPlayer, using this type of URL.p  pMy question is whether or not there is a way to create an AVPlayerItemAVPlayer using this URL which returns raw data, or create one using the raw data itself as an NSData If this is not possible is there a way to save a PFFile to Parse in a different format, one that would be accepted by AVAssetAVPlayer such as .mov.mp4p

Negative 4196 pI am stuck with a problem where I have multiple tables in an update panel. I bind the ASP.net gridview items from code behind when I click an ASP.net button. This causes a postback which triggers my javascript pageLoad functions.p  pInside the pageLoad block I have following function which gets the length of the table and either displays a detailed view if the length is 2 one row or displays the table when the length is more than 2. This works well.p  precode    function           var len  ltgvClave.ClientIDgt tr.length         if len gt 2              document.getElementByIdframeClaveTable.style.display  block             ltgvClave.ClientIDgt.gridviewScroll                 width frameClaveTable.width,                 height 200                          sliderClaveTable.animate width frameClaveTable.width  50           else if len  2              showClaveDetailsltgvClave.ClientIDgt tr               codepre  pI have a third table in the same update panel which I bind when I search for a value in the SQL database. During the postback when I bind the third table I would expect the other tables to be reset and disappear from view. However in the postback pageLoad event the old table is still found and displayed again. I cant get my head around how to prevent this. I have tried to force a postback prior to refreshing the tables. I have tried to put the tables in seperate update panels but to no avail.p  pAny ideas on this issues are welcome.p  pThanks.p
Negative 4196 pIm trying to implement a logic where the Activity starts normal when the user has already an opened session in Facebook. When the user is not logged in he is forwarded to a LoginActivity.p  pHowever I couldnt find any approach yet that works fine.p  pWhen I use the getActiveSession method in the onCreate its always giving null on first start of the Activity even though I am logged in to Facebook. The result is that I am forwarded to the LoginActivity where the uiHelper then fires the callBack that the session is opened. I also tried to get session from cache and everything else that is on the web regarding the sessionnull. p  pIs there any other way to get not null on first activity start Or to save the current session somewhere when activity is destroyed to restore it afterwardsp  pMy second approach was to use the uiHelper on MainActivity start to see if the user is logged in or not. However it doesnt fire the callback if the session is closed or not opened on Activity start...p  pI hope anybody has an idea how to solve this or knows a different approach. Thank you very much for any helpp

But in PowerPoint 2010 the added shape is black as shown in below screen,p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjbjRr.png altenter image description herep  pThis is not the background color. It should be transparent like below image,p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHMpPK.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I view the slide in emSlide Modeem the PDF file is openned and close it, the OLEObject web browser control becomes transparent how it should be. In addition, in PowerPoint 2013 the OLEObject is added as shown below,p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comae9zb.png altenter image description herep  pThat little black square shows by red circle should not be there. This too when viewed in emSlide Modeem the OLEObject web browser control becomes transparent.p  pIn PowerPoint 2007 there are no issues. When the OLEObject is added, it is transparent.p  pSo how to avoid this black color from the OLEObject in PowerPoint 2010 and 2013 When the OLEObject is added it must not show the black color. I think it is because of the web browser control. What do I need to do herep

Negative 4196 pIm trying to read mulitcast data from a UDP socket from within a Media Foundation MediaSource class.  The codeDatagramSocketcode class in WinRT throws an event codeMessageReceivedcode that contains the codeIInputStreamcode for reading the data received.  p  pHowever, I have not been able to attach an event handler from the MediaSource class.  I embelieveem it is because the MF MediaSource class is not a WinRT class but instead a COM class.  In any case, Im not sure how I could get the data from the codeMessageReceivedcode event handler from an external class into my MF MediaSource.  I will be streaming video packets over UDP...p  pAny suggestions on strategies to take would be very welcome.  Thanksp

Negative 4196 pI am working on a simple game engine that provides a base class for game objects that can be extended with subclasses for the specific game. I need to write a function that can take a file, parse object names from it, and instantiate the corresponding objects in the game providing a mechanism for storing level data in files. I had hoped to use metaprogramming to create a function that allows the caller to pass in a variable number of data types and generates a function that searches for names corresponding to those types in a file. Its use would look something along the lines of this using templatesp  precodefileParseFunctionlttype1, type2 type3gtfilename codepre  pwould generate a function equivalent top  precodefileParseFunctionstring filename      code that opens file called filename and handles tokenizingparsing      iftoken  type1              gameWorld.addnew type1          elseiftoken  type2              gameWorld.addnew type2          elseiftoken  type3              gameWorld.addnew type3           other code to finish loading the level   codepre  pCalled with the parameter filename. This should work for a variable number of types 3 in the example. I wrote some code to test the concept which involves generating a similar function. It uses templates to convert typename symbols to strings this is needed for use in the comparisons in the function I eventually hope to write and also variadic templates to generate a function that prints the names of all the types passed in as template parameters.

Negative 4196 pI am doing performance tests on an algorithm I wrote for parallel matrix multiplication in Java. I get the number of cpu cores from runtime, then divide the calculation loop between the available cores, using a thread pool. I measure the run times of the sequential and parallel version, then display the results in an excel chart. There I noticed a strange behavior img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRIyhG.png altenter image description herep  pThis is a performance test of matrix multiplication of square matrices from size 50 to size 1500. The results are an average calculated from 10 runs. The measurements are indicated by dots on the lines and the lines themselves are smoothed. As you can see, the lines of the sequential and parallel functions cross two times. Actually, three times, but the first one is around the matrix sizes 6080, hence not visible in this chart. That is normal, since threads introduce overhead, so fast functions run better sequentially.p  pAre the other two intersections normal I have done multiple measurements in the 500700 region, this behavior seems prevalent.p  pThings I think could play part in this OS thread management, JVM thread management, some thread poolspecific behavior, Intel Hyper Threading since I have an intel i53210M cpu in my machine. However, what seems to be behaving irregularly to me, at least is actually the sequential algorithm. Notice how, until it hits a size of 650, it barely suffers any time penalty. Then it steepens abruptly at a size of 650. In comparison, the parallel curve seems pretty smooth.p  pI have checked the algorithms a few times, Im pretty sure they are bugfree. The results of the calculations are correct, thats for sure. My functions are measured in a double loop the outer one repeats the measurements for later averaging and the inner one increases the matrix size every step. Inside that, the source matrices are randomized, the sequential function is run and measured, then the parallel one is run and measured.p  pIs the behavior on the chart normalp  pIn mainp  precode     do n measurements     for int n  0 n lt measurements n           display progress         System.out.printlnProgress   float n  measurements  100            single measurement         for int i  0, sizen  size i lt steps i, sizen  increment                allocate memory for matrices source a, source b, result             float[][] srcaseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcbseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcapar  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcbpar  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] resseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] respar  new float[sizen][sizen]               fill source matrices with random values             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcaseq, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcbseq, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcapar, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcbpar, sizen               create time variables             long before, after, deltat               time measurement, serial multiplication             before  System.nanoTime             serialMultiplier.mulsrcaseq, srcbseq, resseq, sizen             after  System.nanoTime             deltat  after  before              add measurement to data             data[i][0]  deltat               time measurement, parallel multiplication             before  System.nanoTime             parallelMultiplier.mulsrcapar, srcbpar, respar, sizen             after  System.nanoTime             deltat  after  before              add measurement to data             data[i][1]  deltat                   System.out.printlnProgress 100.0 codepre  pserial multiplicationp  precodepublic void mulfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res, int size      for int i  0 i lt size i          for int j  0 j lt size j              res[i][j]  0             for int k  0 k lt size k                  res[i][j]  srca[i][k]  srcb[k][j]                             codepre  pparallel multiplicationp  precodepublic void mulfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res, int size        calculate data required for labor division     int n  size  size     int load  n  cpuCoreCount  1     int remainder  n  cpuCoreCount       create thread pool     ExecutorService taskExecutor  Executors.newFixedThreadPoolcpuCoreCount       assign tasks     int m  0     int i  0     while i lt remainder          taskExecutor.executenew MultiplierUnitsrca, srcb, res, size, m, m  load         m  load         i          load     while i lt cpuCoreCount          taskExecutor.executenew MultiplierUnitsrca, srcb, res, size, m, m  load         m  load         i            wait for tasks to finish     taskExecutor.shutdown     try        taskExecutor.awaitTerminationLong.MAXVALUE, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS      catch InterruptedException e          System.out.printlnerror thread pool interrupted exception         System.exit1       codepre  pThe values in the data array are later divided by measurements to get the average.p  pMultiplierUnitp  precodepublic class MultiplierUnit implements Runnable        source a, source b, result     private final float[][] srca, srcb, res      matrix dimensions, first entry to execute, last entry to execute     private final int size, first, last      public MultiplierUnitfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res,             int size, int first, int last          this.srca  srca         this.srcb  srcb         this.res  res         this.size  size         this.first  first         this.last  last            parallel multiplication     Override     public void run           index setup         int i  first  size         int j  first  size         int n  first           computation         while n lt last              while j lt size ampamp n lt last                  res[i][j]  0                 for int k  0 k lt size k                      res[i][j]  srca[i][k]  srcb[k][j]                                  n                 j                          j  0             i                codepre

Negative 4196 pMy code involves doing bitwise operations on a huge array of integers. If understand correctly, 64bit computers do calculations on 64bit integers in one clock cycle. If I am doing an 8bit integer bitwise operation, it still consumes 1 clock cycle. If I do eight 8bit integer operations, it will consume 8 clock cycles. Knowing that I can fit eight 8bit integers into a 64bit integer, and do the bitwise operation on the 64bit integer, will I consume 1 clock cycle instead of 8 clock cyclesp

Eventually ater several days of uptime, roughly from 3 to 5 application becomes unusable, due to every interaction with it taking more then minute to complete or timing out outright.p  pHow can I diagnose this behavior  Is there a proper way to determine where the delays come from and why so much memory is usedp
Negative 4196 pIm currently assigned to create custom page in ExpressionEngine because thats the old code. Im not getting used to ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter either. I do inspecting the structure of current code then I decide to put my script to the template so I just choose the template when I create new page in ExpressionEngine admin page.p  pThe question is How to put my custom PHP script to that template because I could not find one PHP script in other template before or If my way is wrong, How to create custom PHP page in ExpressionEnginep  pFYI custom script is want to connect to other server DB and google map API.p
Negative 4196 pI am using the Armadillo c library, that allows highperfomance computation of matrices and vectors. This library has builtin functions to populate its objects with random numbers. I use it in the context of a procedurial random generation of an object. The object creation is random, but no matter how often I recreate the object, it remains the same as long as the seed remains the same.p  pThe issue is that, although I can set the seed to a determined value, and thus recreate the same run on my machine... I lose the coherence of the randomness when going to a different computer. I come from the enchanted land of Matlab where I can specify the function used for the generation of pseudorandom numbers. So, this generation can be cross platform if one chooses the function well. strongBut how do I specify the RNG function for Armadillostrongp  pMy research has led me to this source documentation, that detail the process of random number generationp  pa hrefhttparma.sourceforge.netinternaldocs4300a01181source.html relnofollowhttparma.sourceforge.netinternaldocs4300a01181source.htmla a hrefhttparma.sourceforge.netinternaldocs4300a00087.html relnofollowhttparma.sourceforge.netinternaldocs4300a00087.htmlap  pBut i have no clue on what to do here this code is much more advanced than what I can write. I would appreciate any helpp  pThank you guysp  pRemarks  I do not care how good the random function used is. I just want a fast crossplatform crossarchitecture generator. Deterministic randomness is my goal anyway.  In details, in case it matters, the machines to consider should be intel processors, windows or mac, 32b or 64b.  I have read the several posts mentionning the use of seeds for randomness but it seems that the problem here is the crossplatform context and the fact that the random generator is buried to my untrained eyes at least within Armadillos code.p

Negative 4196 pI was reading about how the Javascript prototype property works along with inheritance and then began to look through the Angular.js code and came up with some questions.p  pFirst off, I read that the prototype property points to an object that has a constructor property which points back to the original function that is used to create the object. So for examplep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode This is the constructor function Shape      this.position  1    The constructor points back to the original function we defined Shape.protoype.constructor  Shape codepre  pThe prototype also contains any other methods or properties that have been defined on it by us or by the Javascript language itself, and these are shared by all instances of the object. If you want an object called Square to inherit from Shape you need to set Squares prototype equal to a new instance of Shape because the internal [[prototype]] property of Square.prototype gets set to the public object value of the Shape.prototype property.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction Square  Square.prototype  new Shape var square  new Square square.position  This will output 1 codepre  pThis all makes sense to me.p  pHowever, the Angular.js code that I have a question about seems to be related to all of this but does something that I do not understand. It doesnt appear to be dealing with inheritance so I can understand why there would be differences, but Im just curious why they wrote it the way they did.p  pWithin Angular.js, there is a HashMap object and a Lexer object, but they are defined differently yet appear to be instantiated and used in the same exact way. The Lexer constructor is first defined, and then they set the prototype to an object literal containing methods that should be shared by all instances of the Lexer. This all makes sense. What I dont understand is why they specify the constructor property and set it to just Lexer when they dont for HashMap below.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar Lexer  functionoptions      this.options  options    Notice they specify Lexer as the constructor even though they dont for HashMap below Lexer.prototype       constructor Lexer,     lex functiontext  ... ,     is functionch, chars  ... ,     peek functioni  ... ,     isNumber functionch  ... ,     isWhitespace functionch  ... ,     isIdent functionch  ... ,     isExpOperator functionch  ... ,     throwError functionerror, start, end  ... ,     readNumber function  ... ,     readIdent function  ... ,     readString functionquote  ...   codepre  pThen if you look at the HashMap code, they do the same thing except that they do not specify the constructor property. Why is this It appears to work exactly the same, and Ive tested that the constructor still gets called.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode The HashMap Constructor function HashMaparray, isolatedUid      if isolatedUid          var uid  0         this.nextUid  function              return uid                   forEacharray, this.put, this   HashMap.prototype       put functionkey, value  ... ,     get functionkey  ... ,     remove functionkey  ...   codepre  pSo is the constructor property optional when there is no inheritance, so maybe one person wrote the Lexer and another the HashMap and one decided to specify the constructorp

I was hoping I could link the PMML straightforwardly to MongoDB using something like the JPMML library as JPMML integrates well with PostgreSQL.p  pHowever, it seems the only way to link MongoDB to my PMML xml file is to use Cascading Pattern through Hadoop.  Since my dataset isnt large lt50GB, I dont really need Hadoop.  p  pHas anyone used PMML with MongoDB before that doesnt involve having to go down the hadoop route  Many thanksp

Negative 4196 pI have a jsp website that has a menu bar. Upon clicking the logout button, the page redirects to the welcome jsp page. However, I hope to make it so that once the user clicks logout, the welcome page now has a div with some span that reads You have successfully logged out. I have been trying to get this to work, but to no avail.p  pIn my javascript, I start with a globally defined variable, and have two related functions.p  precodelogoutDeterminant  no  function determineword     if word  yes            logoutDeterminant  yes        alertlogoutDeterminant        function showLogoutNotification     if logoutDeterminant  yes         alertlogoutDeterminant        toggle the class      codepre  pThe global variable logout determinant starts with no. When the welcome jsp loads, it runs showLogoutNotification, which means the global variable is assigned no, and the class for the div on the page is not toggled. The div is the successful logout notification, and there is a class that hides it. So the toggle doesnt work, and the hidden class isnt removed.p  pOnce the user enters the main page, and then clicks logout, the function  determineyes runs on click, setting the logoutDeterminant to yes.p  pNow, when the welcome page loads again, I imagined that it wouldve registered logout determinant as yes, and therefore toggled the class. However, it comes out as no. This leads me to believe that the javascript resets when the page changes, and so logout determinant is again no. p  pHow would one go about making the logout notification on the same welcome page I have access to java via jsp servlets, jqueryjavascript, html, and such. p

Why wont it return 100 or 100 when the criteria is met and the last 3 lines of my SWITCH statement are also therep  pAny help would be awesomep  pEDITp  pIve figured out the issue.p  pI managed to figure it out in the end. Even though the SWITCH statement would return a true value for the first expression, it looks like the SWITCH statement wont actually return that value until after its evaluated EVERY expression in the statement. When it was trying to evaluate the last 3 statements, there was a divide by zero occurring and thats why it would return ERROR even though the first expression evaluated to true. p  pStrange behaviour because I wouldve thought that once the SWITCH statement found a true value, it wouldnt bother to evaluate the other ones.p  pMy solution was to wrap IIF statements around the final 3 expressions to avoid divide by zero.p  pCode is belowp  precodeSWITCH              SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0.00 AND SUMFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value gt 0.00, 100,         SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0.00 AND SUMFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value lt 0.00, 100,         SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value ltgt 0 AND SUMFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value ltgt 0.99123131414 AND IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 0, ABSSumFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 1, ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value gt 1.00, Large,         SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value ltgt 0 AND SUMFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value ltgt 0.9912313141 AND IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 0, ABSSumFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 1, ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value lt 0.20, Minor,             SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value ltgt 0 AND SUMFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  SUMFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value ltgt 0.9912313141 AND IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 0, ABSSumFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 1, ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value gt 0.20 AND IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 0, ABSSumFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 1, ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value lt 1.00, IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 0, ABSSumFieldsActualMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  IIfABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value  0, 1, ABSSumFieldsForecastMovementCurrentPeriod.Value,     TRUE, Error      codepre  pI still find it strange that SWITCH wont terminate evaluation of the entire block once it finds the first true value  seems like a waste of computation to me.p  pAnyway thanks guysp

Negative 4196 pHere, I am developing a project with java sockets and I have a problem with the implementation of the correct time synchronization between Server and Client. I am going to describe the problem with a simple examplep  pstrongServerstrong runs on GMT and keeps a database with various items. Some of those items are on special offer, but these offers have a time limit before they expire.br So lets say that strongemserver timeemstrong now is strong900AMGMTstrong and there is an offer item ending at strong1000AMGMTstrong.p  pstrongClientstrong may be on a different time and timezone than the server. So lets say that client time now is strong800AMGMT1strong, I can take the time and adjust it to clients timezone and find that it ends at strong900AMGMT1strong ie in 1 hour.p  pstrongProblemstrong How do I calculate the time remaining when a user has a custom time set. br For example, the above client sets the clock manually to be half an hour ahead, ie strong830AMGMT1strong. If you just do the timezone conversion the item would still be ending at strong900GMT1strong, so the time left for the offer to finish is wrong 30mins.p  pOne may say that a possible solution would be to set the client to ask the time left in seconds from the server instead of the exact date ending. But I want to implement something like a count down of seconds in the client side. If offer ends in 60 seconds, the interface would go 60,59,58,..,1,0. So sending a request strongevery secondstrong to the server to get the time left is not be network efficient.p  pOne more thing that worries me is that if you do go with the scenario of requesting the time left in seconds, on slow network the response from server will not come instantly, so by the time the client receives the result is already off time.p

Negative 4196 pSo I cloned quite a lot of different git repos all from GitHub which are toolboxes and function packages that I use for my projects. I usually dont modify them but keep them as a clone so I can easily follow updates and changes in these toolboxes and stay up to date. But I work across multiple computers employing BitBucket and SourceTree as git solution for my own code. Problem now is I clone a repo on one machine but the othersmy BitBucket account does not know about this clone and I have to add it on every machine  SourceTree installation manually. What is the best way to keep track of the cloned projects Thanks for your helpp

Negative 4196 pSo Im working on a ASP.NET MVC 5 WEB API enabled site, which is using CORS to allow communication between the two. My problem is that when I go to delete through the API, I make one ajax call, but two requests are made. As you can see below, one is a regular request, and the other is a CORS compliant request, and the CORS request is obviously making it through, and its deleting the item. However what I dont understand is why the other one is even there. Any ideas Ive already checked to see if multiple event handlers are on the element and any sort of problem related to that.

So something likep  precode         s       x         y                                                                         t codepre  pNow for E0, 1, I will need another edge going from s to y also with capacity A, so now the Graph looks something likep  precode         s                                                       x         y                                                                         t codepre  pNow my question is since sy has capacity A and yt has capacity A, can I remove these two edges without changing the minimum cut on this graph The reason I ask is that this construction is indeed given by a single edge from x to t in the source code from Kolmogorovs library and I cannot understand this construction.p

Negative 4196 pI am having a hard time making CSRF Guard to work on Ajax Requests in my Grails Application. I already added the Javascript Servlet in the page and followed instructions in their website. The problem is that it kept on saying that I have missing token. Aside from that, our Ajax request is not inside a form which I would assume that CSRF would look for forms and autoinject the token for Ajax POST requests. I just merely get each parameters and pass it as data in my Ajax POST request.p
Negative 4196 pIn the current ColladaLoader.js I dont see anything that reads or applies the Collada standards weighting value 0.01.0 that indicates bump intensity or bumpScale in Three.js Phong material.  I noticed that when I export my collada from Blender it picks up the bump materials instantly in three.js which is amazingly simple  YAY but my materials always get an exaggerated bumpScale of default 1.0.  It gives the materials an exaggerated bumpiness.p  pI managed to edit my ColladaLoader a bit and try out my ideal value 0.05 but wonder if Im missing something or doing this wrong  Anybody else try this  Note that Ive not had good luck with json exports so Im sticking with Collada for now.p  pThanksp

Negative 4196 pSo I have an abstract view controller that presents a file type. I then have a few different subclasses of this view controller all are subclasses of the abstract view controller, none are subclasses of each other. Most of the view controllers use the abstract view controllers implementation, but some of them override certain methods. Because of this, I have to make those specific methods public in the abstract view controller, incase I have to call super in them. p  pI dont use protocols here, but I wonder if that would allow for cleaner code. Any other ideas are welcome here.p  pFor example, in my abstract view controller, I have a method that calls another method codesaveFilecode. The abstract view controller doesnt actually have an implementation for the method, but rather each subclass has its own implementation depending on file type. Thus I have have to make that method public in the interface and theres no way for future subclasses to know that they need to implement that own method themselves, otherwise theyl crash at runtime.p

Negative 4196 pI need some help wrapping my head around doing the following.p  pI have a predefined list if ID numbers, well call them codeAliascode, which I get from a CSV file. What Im trying to do is compare that list to my database and find which ones exist in the CSV but NOT in the SQL database.p  pFirst thing is Im unsure as to how to define a list of say code1,2,3,4,5code as a table with the column name as codeAliascode so that I can join  select from that.p  pSecondly, how would you go about writing this query I was thinking of having to structure it something like the followingp  precodeSELECT  FROM 1,2,3,4,5 WHERE Alias NOT IN  SELECT Alias FROM table1 WHERE Alias IN 1,2,3,4,5 codepre  pIm aware that this query wouldnt work, think of it more like pseudocode, but even if something like that were to work, writing out that list twice could prove to be troublesome I can have upwards of 50K alias in the list and most likely horribly inefficient.p  pThanks for any advicep

Negative 4196 pI have written a simple binary tree using structures and a couple of functions in order to add, search, find the minimum and maximum values, remove a node as well as destroy the node, the problem is that I have been using recursion and dealing with it in the same way and I am having a hard time trying to comprehend if my function for sorting the algorithm is efficient enough.p  pThe whole code isp  precodeincludeltiostreamgt using namespace std     This is a very simple example demonstrating a very basic binary tree to be    implemented using structurs, later on I would like to create this by using   classes, but for now, structures and pointers would suffice       The node is created in here, notice how the pointer has the ability to    self reference to 2 different positions, this means that there is the ability   to store to 2 different branches of memory      struct node   int keyvalue   node  pleft   node  pright        This is the creation of the add function that will add to the linked list      node addnode  ptree, int key    The base case of the recursive function will be placed in here   since binary trees are recursive in nature and linked data structures   are as a whole in terms of space and memory, the recursive function will   suffice for most cases involving binary trees.   In this case, if the given parameter is null, we create the tree   by allocating the necessary memory space   if ptree  NULL      node  pnewtree  new node     pnewtreegtpleft  NULL     pnewtreegtpright  NULL     pnewtreegtkeyvalue  key     return pnewtree    end of base case    Depending of the value of the node, we determine if we will add to the left side or the right side of the subtree   if key lt ptreegtkeyvalue      if it is less than the value, we add to the left     ptreegtpleft  insertptreegtpleft, key      else     ptreegtpright  insertptreegtpright, key      return ptree   end of function          This is where the search function will be created   in here the function will go over all the subtrees untill the one with the necessary key is returned   again, this uses recursive functions doing things step by step      First Look to see if the given tree node is emptyNULL if yes then return NULL      Second If we find the key by referencing the key value, then we are done and return that particular tree     Third Otherwise, look into the left and right sides of the tree making recursive calls to this very same function until          the one that we are looking for is found.        node searchnode ptree, key    First   if ptree  NULL  return NULL     Second   else if ptreegtkeyvalue  key  return ptree     Third   else ifkey lt ptreegtkeyvalue      searchptreegtpleft, key Thus it looks into the left with the same recursive algorithm      else      searchptreegtpright, key    End of recursive search function       Easiest function to implement, since the delete key is used being that the whole concept falls inside memory being allocated to the   list via the creation of new nodesthis means using the new keyword to allocate memory, much like creating new objects in other languages     First Check to see if passed tree is not null, if not null destroy the left and right subtree using the same function          else nothing.      NOTE The return value is set to void since it returns nothing back to the list     void destroynodenode ptree    First   if ptree  NULL      destroyptreegtpleft     destroyptreegtpright     cout ltlt endl     cout ltlt Destroying left subtree node ltlt endl     cout ltlt Destroying right subtree node ltlt endl     cout ltlt Deleting the entire node  ltlt ptreegtkeyvalue ltlt endl     cout ltlt endl     delete ptree    End of recursive destroy function         Finding the max value is simple, we evaluate the left and right node and use base cases to see which node to return   Why just right   looking back at the theory behind binary trees, the tree on the right is always the biggest element. That is how trees are normally sorted.   there is no need to look at the keys, the code will sort out by itself in this space since if it is not null it will return the highest.   node returnmaxnode ptree    if ptree  NULL      return NULL      if ptreegtpright  NULL      return ptree      return returnmaxptreegtpright  End of return max recursive function        Max node, basically the opposite of the avobe taking advantage of the fact that the left node is lesser   recursion will be used again      node returnminnode ptree   if ptree  NULL      return NULL      ifptreegtpleft  NULL      return ptree      return returnminptreegtpleft End of recursive return min function       We need a remove max function in order to properly remove the biggest node in case it is found, that way we can implement a recursive   algorithm inside the  function in charge of removing the node we want, we can simply remove the node by using delete or destroy once we   find it because that would only destroy the entire tree No no, that is not good.     node removemaxnodenode ptree, node pmaxnode    if ptree  NULL  return NULL    if ptree  pmaxnode      return pmaxnodegtpleft Because the left one is lesser      Now for the recursive call, implementing this means that we will remove from the node on the right   basing us on the sense that the right tree is the highest one, it will go then from top to bottom   ptreegtpright  removemaxnodeptreegtpright, pmaxnode   return the tree after the changes in the addresses have been conducted properly   return ptree                   Removing from a tree is also simple based on the recursive nature of the element being discussed     First Check to see if the tree is null, if yess, return null     node removeNnode ptree, int key    First   if ptree  NULL  return NULL   Second   ifptreegtkeyvalue  key      Third     if ptreegtpleft  NULL        node prightsub  ptreegtpright       delete ptree       return prightsub          if ptreegtpright  NULL        node pleftsub  ptreegtpleft       delete ptree       return pleftsub           node pmaxN  returnmaxptreegtpleft     pmaxNgtpleft  removemaxnodeptreegtpleft, pmaxnode     pmaxNgtpright  ptreegtpright     delete ptee     return pmaxnode      else ifkey lt ptreegtkeyvalue      ptreegtpleft  removeNptreegtpleft, key      else      ptreegtpright  removeNptreegtpright, key      After all  changes have been done   return ptree        The entire implementation is sorted when calling return min and max         node sortedNnode ptree   if ptree  NULLreturn NULL    return sortedNreturnmaxptree        int mainint argv, char []    cout ltlt This is merely a test ltlt endl   return 0  codepre  pMy understanding is that the way I defined the other functions originally already sort and return the state of the node itself in a new way being that I am using pointers. Maybe I am wrong to think that my sorting function works. I have been with this all day and cannot think of a better way, most of my code was written for the understanding I have in it and the help of my books, my instructor is not being much help as well so I came here seeking some wisdom.p
