Positive 23 pI have a set of about 200 unique IDs from a revenue batch that I need to run a stored procedure against. My idea was to create a temp table, insert the unique values, run the stored proc against the temp table and drop the temp table. However whenever I execute my code I am receiving the error message Conversion failed when converting from a character string to uniqueidentifier. I can not figure out why I am getting this error. Is anyone familiar with this error that could possibly help me out Can you look at my code and see the reason for this message Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Positive 23 pIm trying to convert some MS Access queries to TSQL to use in SSIS basically converting Access db to SQL server 2008 and Im having trouble converting an IIF statement. I tried several approaches and it always resulted in an error.p  pThe query creates a column with dates that are original Date  2 years if the condition is met and original Date  1 if the condition is not met. The first part of the IIF eliminates the case of the original year being a leap year and so the possibility of generating a nonexisting date.p  pThe original IIF statement isp  precodeIIfDayDate29 And MonthDate2,    IIfDesc Like  amp 123 amp ,     DateSerialYearDate2,MonthDate,DayDate1,     DateSerialYearDate1,MonthDate,DayDate1,   IIfDesc Like  amp 123 amp ,     DateSerialYearDate2,MonthDate,DayDate,     DateSerialYearDate1,MonthDate,DayDate AS Term codepre  pSo the problem is not only an IIF statement but also DATESERIAL function. I found the solution for the DATESERIAL function using CAST SQL server 2008 does not have the DATEFROMPARTS function....p  pI tried using CASE like thisp  precodeCASE WHEN DAYDate29 AND MonthDate2 THEN     CASE         WHEN Desc LIKE 123 THEN     CASTCASTYEARDate2 AS VARCHAR4  RIGHT0  CASTMONTHDate AS VARCHAR2, 2  RIGHT0  CASTDAYDate1 AS VARCHAR2, 2 AS DATETIME          ELSE CASTCASTYEARDate1 AS VARCHAR4  RIGHT0  CASTMONTHDate AS VARCHAR2, 2  RIGHT0  CASTDAYDate1 AS VARCHAR2, 2 AS DATETIME  END  ELSE CASE     WHEN Desc LIKE 123 THEN     THEN CASTCASTYEARDate2 AS VARCHAR4  RIGHT0  CASTMONTHDate AS VARCHAR2, 2  RIGHT0  CASTDAYDate AS VARCHAR2, 2 AS DATETIME      ELSE CASTCASTYEARDate1 AS VARCHAR4  RIGHT0  CASTMONTHDate AS VARCHAR2, 2  RIGHT0  CASTDAYDate AS VARCHAR2, 2 AS DATETIME END END AS Term codepre  pI also tried using COAELSCE but with no better outcome.p  pI really dont know if I have made some kind of syntax error or where the problem could be.p  pThank you in advance for any help.p  pedit Ill add error message Im getting Incorrect syntax near ....

Sample data is listed below a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comd0Ca3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd0Ca3.png altCurrent Resultsap  pThe query I use to get that data isp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT AH.locationid as locationid ,AH.adate as date ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  201 THEN Amount END  AS attrib1 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  204 THEN Amount END  AS attrib2 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  206 THEN Amount END  AS attrib3 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  212 THEN Amount END  AS attrib4 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  215 THEN Amount END  AS attrib5 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  218 THEN Amount END  AS attrib6 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  221 THEN Amount END  AS attrib7 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  231 THEN Amount END  AS attrib8 ,AH.checkid as checktype FROM [asum] ASum  INNER JOIN [Ahead] AH ON  Asum.AID  AH.AID  WHERE AH.code IN 212,201,206,204,215,218,221,231  AND AH.checkid ltgt c AND AH.checkid ltgt b  GROUP BY   AH.code ,ASum.amount ,AH.adate ,AH.checkid  ORDER BY   AH.locationid ,AH.adate ,attrib1 ,attrib2 ,attrib3 ,attrib4 ,attrib5 ,attrib6 ,attrib7 ,attrib8 ,AH.checkid codepre  pSo what I am trying to do is return the newest two dates for every location  and all of the attrib for those newest two dates. p  pSo I am essentially trying to get something that looks like this a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comG0zNw.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG0zNw.png altWanted Resultsap  pThe closest I have gotten is doing adding the below inner join code to the query and that gets me just the top date...the problem I face is how to get two max dates from this subquery that I innerjoin too.p  precode  INNER JOIN SELECT                  locationid,                 MAXadate as newest               FROM   ahead               GROUP BY locationid t1  ON t1.locationid  AH.locationid  AND t1.newest  AH.adate codepre  pSo with that inner join I just get 1 of each location id instead of two of each location id like I need. The rough part is that this is on a SQL Server 2000 database...UGH. p  pThanks so much in advance for any tipsadvicep

Positive 23 pI am using healthcare data and need to identify a patients number of stays and admit date and leave date in location X. However, the problem is that patients move between different locations and I need to account for the time in between. Sometimes a patient will start in location X, move to location Y, and then move back to location X. For this scenario, if the stay at location Y is less than or equal to 48 hours, then I need the length of stay to be calculated using the in date of the first stay at location X and the out date of the last stay at location X.p  pExample datap  precodePatientID     Location        InDateTime           OutDateTime     1            x            792003 1000am     792003 100pm     1            y            792003 100pm      7102003 200pm     1            y            7102013 200pm     7102003 400pm     1            x            7102003 400pm     7132003 800pm     2            y            7202003 100pm     7212003 900am     2            x            7212003 900am     7242003 800am     2            y            7242003 800am     7302003 1000am     2            x            842003  300pm     872003 1100am codepre  pDesired outputp  precodePatientID      InDateTime           OutDateTime     1          792003 1000am     7132003 800pm     2          7212003 900am     7242003 800am     2          842003 300pm      872003 1100am codepre  pI have tried using case statements, minmax, laglead, etc. In the case above, minmax doesnt work because I need to keep two separate visits to location X for PatientID and therefore cannot group on PatientID.

Negative 23 pI have a UserControl that consists of three TextBoxes. On a form I can have one or more or my UserControl. I want to implement my own tab behavior so if the user presses Tab in the second TextBox I should only move to the third TextBox if the the second TextBox has anything entered. If nothing is entered in the second TextBox the next control of the form should get focus as per the normal tab behavior. If the user hasnt entered anything in the first or second TextBox and the presses tab there is this special case where a control on the form should be skipped. p  pBy using the ProcessDialogKey I have managed to get it work kind of ok but I still have one problem.

Negative 23 pEverywhere I go on google I get the same answer to this problem but it is the wrong answer for me. Originally I installed Subversion 1.5.6 for windows i run Windows Server 2008 on my server and i made a repository for a project. Then I used a Tortoise client version 1.6.X on my laptop to update the project. Everything was hunkydory until I tried to use a postcommit hook script i am updating folders in wwwroot on commit to reflect changes on a web page. I got a message to the effect of This client is too old to work with working copy XXX.p  pSo I uninstalled the SVN client on my laptop and removed the repository from the server. I then made a new repository on the server from scratch and installed TortoiseSVN version 1.5.6 thinking if the client version is the same as the Subversion on the server then they should play nice. After i downloaded the repository on my laptop again and reinstalled my hook script I get the same message...p  pIt is quite painstaking and disruptive to have to keep obliterating my repositories and reinstalling my client to find ones that cooperate through trial and error. I see no reason and can find none online as to why the repository would argue if both TortoiseSVN and my server Subversion are both 1.5.6.p  pIs there anyone out there that can give some insight as to why I would be getting this message Perhaps even someone who could let me know what version of TortoiseSVN I need to use in order for my Server SVN 1.5.6 to not complain. My hook script works from the command line on my server so I know its not its fault. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 23 pMy site is here a hrefhttptreethink.com relnofollowhttptreethink.comap  pWhat I have going is a news ticker on the right that is inside a jquery function. The function starts right away and extracts the news ticker and then retracts it as it should. When a navigation it adds a class to the div, which the function then checks for to see if it should stop extractingretracting. This all works great. p  pThe problem I am having is that after the close button is clicked in the content window, the removeClass wont work.

Negative 23 pI am using ASP.NET MVC2 with NHibernate, but am facing an issue. All calls to the database via NHibernate should be inside a transaction, however code inside the view kicks off database calls in some instances. Thus there is a need to be able to commit the transaction after the view has rendered.p  pFor example displaying a list of users and their user roles you might show the user role using this code  lt Model.UserRole.Name p  pThis will cause a hit on the database as the UserRole is loaded using a NHibernate proxy.p  pYou can fetch the UserRole eagerly which circumvents the issue in this case, but there are cases where it is much faster to use lazy loading.p  pAnyway, is there a way to run code after the view has renderedp

No minimum platform version decided yet, but rather likely could be API level 7.li listrongBlackberrystrong. It would use the same base source of J2ME but taking advantage of some advaced capabilities of the platform. No minimum configuration decided yet maybe 4.6 because of 64 KB limitation for RMS on 4.5.li ul  pBasically the API would sport three kind of storesp  ul liemFilesem. These would allow standard directoryfile manipulation readwrite through streams, create, mkdir, etc..li liemPreferencesem. It is a special store that handles properties accessed through keys Similar to plain old java properties file but supporting some improvements such as different value data types such as SharedPreferences on Android platformli liemLocal Message Queuesem. This store would offer basic message queue functionality.li ul  h3Considerationsh3  hr  pInspired on JSR75, all types of stores would be accessed in an uniform way by means of an URL following a hrefhttpwww.faqs.orgrfcsrfc1738.html relnofollowRFC 1738a conventions, but with custom defined prefixes i.e. file for files, prefs for preferences or queue for message queues. The address would refer to a virtual location that would be mapped to a physical storage object by each mobile platform implementation. Only files would allow hierarchical storage folders and access to external extorage memory cards by means of a unit name, the same way as in JSR75, but that would not change regardless of underlying platform. The other types would only support flat storage.p  pThe system should also support a emsecure version of all basic typesem. The user would indicate it by prefixing s to the URL i.e. sfile instead of file. The API would emonly require one PINem introduced only once to access any kind of secure object types.p  h3Implementation issuesh3  hr  pFor the implementation of both plaintext and encrypted stores, I would use the functionality available on the underlying platformsp  ul listrongFilesstrong. These are available on all platforms J2ME only with JSR75, but it is mandatory for our needs. The abstract File to actual File mapping is straight except for addressing issues. li listrongRMSstrong. This type of store available on J2ME and Blackberry platforms is convenient for Preferences and maybe Message Queues though depending on performance or size requirements these could be implemented by means of normal files.li listrongSharedPreferencesstrong. This type of storage, only available on Android, would match Preferences needs.li listrongSQLite databasesstrong. This could be used for message queues on Android and maybe Blackberry.li ul  pWhen it comes to encryption some requirements should be metp  ul liTo ease the implementation it will be carried out on readwrite operations basis on  streams for files, RMS Records, SharedPreferences keyvalue pairs, SQLite database columns.

What approach would you prefer And when it comes to using a standard KeyStore with multiplekey generation given this is your preference, would it be better to use a recordstore per storage object or just a global KeyStore keeping all keys i.e. using the URL identifier of abstract storage object as aliasli listrongMaster keystrong. The use of a master key seems obvious. This key should be protected by user PIN introduced only once and would allow access to the rest of encryption keys they would be encrypted by means of this master key.

If that reveals nothing,  and this has happened to me before  then I try various inputs in hopes of getting the bug to surface also in the Debug build. If that fails, then I would try to track changes to find the most recent version for which the two builds diverge in behavior.

Negative 23 pI was just pointed to a very interesting a hrefhttpwww.fortify.comservletdownloadspublicfortifyattackingthebuild.pdf relnofollowarticlea about a security problem called Cross Build Injection XBI. Bascially it is a fancy name for smuggling bad code into an application at build time via automated build systems such as ant, maven or ivy.p  pThe problem could be alleviated by introducing a cryptographic signature validation fr dependencies as it is currently in place with many operating systems for downloading packages.p  pTo be clear I am emnotem talking about simply providing md5 or sha1 hashes for the artifacts. That is already done, but those hashes are stored in the same location as the artifacts. So once a malicious hacker compromises the repository and can replace the artifact they can replace the hashes as well.p  pSo what is acutally needed is some kind of PKI, that allows the developers to sign their artifacts and maven to verify these signatures. Since the signature is done using the private key of the developer it cannot be tampered with when only the repository is compromised.p  pDoes anyone know the state of this in mavenp

Negative 23 pThis is what Im trying to accomplish. Im making a remote call to a server for information, and I want to block to wait for the info. I created a function that returns a Deferred such that when the RPC comes in with the reply, the deferred is called. Then I have a function called from a thread that goes codethreads.blockingCallFromThreadreactor, deferredfunc, argscode.p  pIf something goes wrong  for example, the server goes down  then the call will never unblock. Id prefer the deferred to go off with an exception in these cases.p  pI partially succeeded. I have a deferred, codeonConnectionLostcode which goes off when the connection is lost. I modified my blocking call function top  precode    deferred  deferredfuncargs     self.onConnectionLost.addCallbacklambda  deferred.errback         failure.FailureExceptionconnection lost while getting run     result  threads.blockingCallFromThread         reactor, lambda  deferred, None     return result codepre  pThis works fine. If the server goes down, the connection is lost, and the errback is triggered. However, if the server does not go down and everything shuts down cleanly, codeonConnectionLostcode still gets fired, and the anonymous callback here attempts to trigger the errback, causing an codeAlreadyCalledcode exception to be raised.p  pIs there any neat way to check that a deferred has already been fired I want to avoid wrapping it in a codetryexceptcode block, but I can always resort to that if thats the only way.p

Negative 23 pThis is more out of personal curiosityinterest than a specific problem Im trying to solve.p  pSuppose you have a program that is performing some operation on usersupplied information such as a search string that changes as the user types it. Suppose that you want to show the user the most relevant information for what theyve typed at any given time.p  pIf threads were really abortable, we could simply have one thread running based on the lastchanged search string, and cancel any previous threads that were in progress.p  pNow the generally accepted best practice for doing this today is to use a delay timer as the user types, which waits for .5 to 1 second before initiating the operation. I hope its obvious enough that this isnt an emidealem solution, theoretically speaking any kind of artificial delay imposes an artificial bottleneck that can never be overcome, even if it is only 0.5 seconds.p  pFurthermore, todays best practice goes on to state that any subsequent operations should wait for the previous one to complete before executing. In a world where we cant abort operations, this makes sense, but again, theoretically speaking this is far from ideal. Imagine the user types a single character and pauses just long enough for the operation to begin. Suppose that this operation takes 10 seconds to execute. The user is now forced to wait an unacceptable amount of time before the results of hisher query are visible.p  pAn unideal workaround to this would be to have multiple operations executing concurrently, presuming it is safe to do so, but this would still result in significantly reduced performance.p  pSo Im just wondering peoples thoughts on this, specific to .NET at least, and whether there are any new developments in this area since I last researched it that I should know about parallel libraries perhaps. Id also be curious to know if any other languagesframeworks can handle this sort of finegrained control of operations better than .NET can.p  pCheers.p

Negative 23 pI have been looking at setting up web applications that rely heavily on the ability for users to frequently and substantially modify subscriptions.

For instance one user might have 1 Plan A billed monthly at 10 and 10 plan C billed at 50 per month and 1 Plan D billed at 100 per year.li liSupport changing of arbitrary payment amounts. For instance, user was on the 40 per month plan, but then changes that to a 100 per month plan. Then cancels, then signs up again at 50 per month before the 100 period was up. The user should still get 100 of service for the month that he paid 100 for, and then should change to the 40 per month plan.li liAllow for payments of subscription amounts between my users. So one user might initiate a payment of 50 of whatever amount he has paid into the system so far. My application will be handling these types of marketplace style operations and these payments should work in the context of subscriptions... li ul  pIt does not appear that there is an Open Source PHP library that does what I need either with Amazon or Paypal.

I cannot use the a hrefhttpanswers.onstartups.comquestions3852newstartuphowtohandlebillingvarious subscription services that are availablea. Because they generally do not support the features above, and because I need to have direct access to the PayPal or Amazon FPS API for later cleverness via marketplace issues.  p  pWhich brings me to my question. Which payment platform should I choose for ease of managing subscriptions Please send me in the right direction, I only have so much time. But I also do not have time to make the wrong decision. Please provide evidence for your preferences, and if possible detail your work comparing the two systems. Google has the only other payment platform and currently their subscription system is in beta..

Is there a more efficient way to make the subsequent queries not have to filter by date Would there be a speed difference p  pAlso what do you think would be the best method for caching the objectBase query since theoretically it could hold hundreds or thousands of objects for the dates filtered and the likely hood of the start, end dates being the same for a request is very unlikely. p  plike say somebody could request the stats between dates t1 and t2, and then later request t3 to t4 where t1 lt t3 lt t2 and t2 lt t4 so there is some overlap. Is there a way to cache it so where there is overlap between the requests that it would have to access the db for itp  psorry if this seems like a hefty request, but any help would be appreciated. p

The theory is that each subsequent call to the service will round robin the servers and balance the load.p  pHowever this does not work presumably because the result of the DNS lookup is cached for a small amount of time on the client. The result is that we get a flood of requests to each server before it moves on to the next.p  pIs that presumption correct and what are the alternative options herep  pa bit more googling has suggested that I can disable client side caching for DNS a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb318803 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb318803ap  p...however this states the default cache time is 1 day which is not consistent with my experiencesp

For all users who have javascript enabled, this works fine.  p  pBut I wanted also a fallback for the users who have javascript disabled. For them, a click on the submit button on page 1 does not lead to page 2 but to a postback to page 1. Page 1 could now detect this and do a codeServer.Transferpage2.aspxcode to page 2. The problem is When page 2 uses codePreviousPagecode then page 1 is created again and would do a codeServer.Transfercode again and again and again ...   p  pMy workaround for this is to do the codeServer.Transfercode not in the codePageLoadcode event but only in the codePagePreRendercode event because this event does only occur when it is a normal postback and not when the page is created as codePreviousPagecode.br This workaround works but it is very dirty. If I could differentiate between the two scenarios already in the codePageLoadcode event, it would be much better.p  pIs this possiblep

Negative 23 pI am working on and app called whereami from the BNR Guide to iOS programming chapter 5. I have the app working and left it on my phone to show the wife and family I am learning stuff. It is exhibiting a regular crashing behavior though. Here is what happens....p  pWhen you first open app and run it it does fine, If you hit home and then open it again within just a few minutes it does fine, If you leave it in the background then reopen more than a few minutes say like 5 or more later it crashes.  You can then reopen it then and it does fine but the pattern repeats. p  pI have double checked all my code with the book and looked on the errata page but cant figure out what could be wrong. The Xcode organizer shows logs for all the crashes but I dont know how to read that yet. I was starting to wonder if since this is just a learning project app, not meant for real use, maybe it is missing something that makes it multitaskbackgroundreopen correctly I am using Xcode 4.1 on Lion with iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3.4.

I did some research and the consensus was that you have to write your own ClassLoader for every JAR you produce, but since Im already having a tough time seeing that forest through the trees, that statement isnt sinking in with me.p  pCan someone provide a concrete example of how writing my own ClassLoader would put a bandaid on this gaping wound I know, I know, the only real solution is OSGip  pSay I write a new JAR called codeSuperJar1.0.jarcode that does all sorts of amazing stuff. Say my codeSuperJar1.0.jarcode has two other dependencies, codeFizz1.0.jarcode and codeBuzz1.0.jarcode. Both codeFizzcode and codeBuzzcode jars depend on codelog4jcode, except codeFizz1.0.jarcode depends on codelog4j1.2.15.jarcode, whereas codeBuzz1.0.jarcode depends on codelog4j1.2.16.jarcode.

Negative 23 pIm having a really strange problem. Ive written an iOSRails app in which users have accounts, and need to log in to perform all kinds of actions within the app.p  pWhen the app launches, the app detects whether the users username and password have been stored. If not, it prompts for login credentials. Anyway, logging in seems to be working perfectly, and the server sends back the appropriate response. p  pHowever, when I try to do anything else in the app that requires being logged in, I get an error from the server saying I dont have the login credentials. I didnt think I had to do anything special with the cookies i.e. I thought they were stored automatically, but maybe Im wrongp  pIf some code samples would help, let me know what snippets youd like to see and Ill post them, but I feel like this is more of a conceptual misunderstanding on my part than anything else.p  pAny help is much appreciatedp  pEDIT I tested the app on my friends phone, and it works fine. Its only my phone which is having trouble with the app. I looked for any settings involving cookies, but because all the apps are sandboxed, changing settings with cookies in Safari, for example, wont help. Im pulling my hair out with this issue. Ive restarted my phone, deleted and reinstalled the app, and tried changing some of the code, without any success. The Facebook app works as expected, so I assume cookies are being stored in Facebooks sandbox. Only my app seems to be having this problem, but it was working yesterday. Any suggestionsp

Negative 23 pI have a layout where a splash screen asks for input from a user, and upon getting the appropriate input it slides away off the top of the screen, revealing the main interface of the app. The splash screen bit of the layout is a RelativeLayout hierarchically at the same level as the LinearLayout which contains the main interface.  Due to constraints of the application these cant be two separate activities. Heres the animation XML Im using to make the splash slide away.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltset xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid gt     lttranslate         androidduration600         androidfromYDelta0         androidtoYDelta100          androidstartOffset300      gt ltsetgt codepre  pandp  precodelaunchLayout.startAnimationmSlideOutTop launchLayout.setVisibilityView.GONE codepre  pthis works really well, but it seems like after the startoffset of 300ms when the view actually starts to move, all of the views from the main layout of the app move in front of it, zaxiswise.

Negative 23 pWhen a webview is done loading it only shows a white page. The strangest part is that events like a click on an anchor are still working. After i perform this event and go back with the back key, the webview is rendered correctly.p  pThis behavior doesnt appear on a HTC Desire with Android 2.3.7, but it appears on the Asus Transformer Prime with Android 4.0.3.p  pIf i put a Thread.sleep10000 in onPageFinished the page is visible for 10 seconds but then turns white, events are still working.  p  pThe Activity is the Launcher activity and extends a custom base activity. Every activity in my app extends this base activity. The base activity detects if a user is authorized and shows the login activity is needed. When i press the back button after the login activity is displayed, the launcher activity is shows the behavior as described above. p  pDont know what to do right now to solve this problem... p  pThe easiest way is to say that it is a bug in Android. But that doesnt solve my problem. Any suggestions to solve this case p

Negative 23 pIm wondering what is the best way to initialize log4Net in a NUnit project. Of course I want to call the init code ie. codeXmlConfigurator.Configurecode as soon as I can to get as many early log output as I can. But since my project is run through NUnit, I have little control on its entry point.p  pAccording to NUnit documentation, it should call some constructors first, then a method marked with the code[SetUp]code attribute in a class marked with code[TestFixtureSetup]code.p  pSo, First, I created a static helper class which I can call several times without trouble. p  precode  public static class LoggingFacility        private static bool loggerIsUp  false      public static void InitLogger            if loggerIsUp  false         XmlConfigurator.ConfigureAndWatchf        loggerIsUp  true         codepre  pThen, I made all my code[TestFixtureSetup]code inherit a single one that does pretty much nothing else than calling codeLoggingFacility.initLoggercode. But that still leaves all constructors that are run earlier, in an order I can only assume random. And moreover, it will probably do some static initializations before I am even able to execute some code.p  pIn fact, as I can see in my log, the first 4 seconds or so of execution are completely unrecorded.p  pDoes it mean I will have to call my codeInitLoggercode in every constructor and forbid the use of any static initializer Thats tough jobp  pDoes somebody know a magic trick with thisp

Negative 23 pWe have a simple WCF service that is tagged with InstanceContextMode  Single and ConcurrencyMode  Multiple. For methods  that return Lists, rather than going out to our database and filling the list when the call is made, we simply return a local copy of the list.  The list is maintained by a background thread that goes out to our database every 24 hours and repopulates the list. We handle the concurrency issues by locking on an object in 2 places inside the method returning the collection, and inside the method filling the collection.p  pMy question is, how can we make this more efficient. Currently, we have a bottleneck in out service method GetCustomers that the client will callp  precodepublic ListltZGpCustomergt GetCustomers      ListltZGpCustomergt customerListCopy  new ListltZGpCustomergt     lock customerLock              customerListCopy  new ListltZGpCustomergtcustomers           return customerListCopy  codepre  pSince customers is being filled only every 24 hours, it seems like we should only every need to lock inside the GetCustomers method ONLY when were modifying the collection. The way it is currently set up, if 1000 requests come in at the same time, were effectively queuing the 1000 requests since only 1 thread will have access to that method at a time. This is rendering the multithreading aspect of the service somewhat useless, no  p  pIs there a best practice for this sort of pattern Should I be using a more appropriate data collection to store my objects in Would a BlockingCollection be a more suitable fitp

At worst it can take 3 or 4 clicks before one is registered.p  pIm guessing that Im doing something obviously wrong in my code, but Im not sure what.

With the code below I just have the basic applet and the mouselistener and on right click a count increments in console and prints its value to screen. This works fine most of the time, but every now and again, a right click is lost and not registered.p  pWith the full class, I could sometimes get sequences of 3 or 4 or more right clicks not being registered, so the bug was much more obvious.

Negative 23 pI looked at the sqlite.org docs, but I am new to this, so bear with me. I have a tiny bit of experience with MySQL, and I think using it would be an overkill for what I am trying to do with my application.p  pFrom what I understand I can initially create an SQLite db file locally on my MAC and add entrees to it using a Firefox extension. I could then store any number of tables and images as binary. Once my site that uses this db is live, I could upload the db file to any web hosting service to any directory. In my site I could have a form that collects data and sends a request to write that data to the db file. Then, I could have an iOS app that connects to the db and reads the data. Did I get this rightp  pWould I be able to run a Python script that writes to SQLite What questions should I ask a potential hosting service I want to leave MediaTemple, so I am looking around... I dont want to be limited to a Windows server, I am assuming SQLite would run on Unix Or, does it depend on a hosting service Thanksp

Negative 23 pI ran into a problem that suggests I may be implementing a design pattern improperly. I have dynamic subviews whose sizes are language dependent. When I present a modal view, I set the layout during viewDidLoad. I noticed that a UILabel object was not dispalying correctly and found the problem to be that the size of the modal view during viewDidLoad is not the same as the size when the view is shown.p  pThe width of the modal view during viewDidLoad s 768. After the view has appeared, the width is 540.p  pThis suggests that I should be setting layout during viewWillAppear, and not during viewDidLoad. p  pThis seems to contradict my understanding of the DRY principle, if I apply it to execution, as the layout isnt going to change once the view is loaded, so I would be unnecessarily repeating the layout code every time the view appears. I know that in my example, the language setting could be changed in between presentations of the modal, but there may be other examples where this type of dynamic doesnt exist.p  pI implement the layout in nonmodal views the same way  in viewDidLoad. p  pShould I be doing this differentlyp

Negative 23 pI have an ASP.Net Calendar control that, on DayRender, loops through a list of CalendarEvents one of my classes.  If the day that DayRender is on is in the list of CalendarEvents, then fill that calendar cell with the details of the event.p  pIn my test environment, there is no problem, but I imagine with thousands of records, it might become a problem.  Here is what Im doingp  precodepublic partial class calendar  System.Web.UI.Page      CalendarEventList allevents  CalendarEventManager.GetListAll      PageLoad, etc...      protected void calmaincalendarDayRenderobject sender, DayRenderEventArgs e              foreach CalendarEvent x in allevents                      if e.Day.Date  x.EventDate                              logic to extract the data from x, and modify the e.Cell to display that data                             codepre  pMy questions arep  p1 Im putting the events as a page level variable, so that the database only needs to be called once, and not on every single DayRender.  Good, bad  Potential issues  This page is purely to read the Calendar Events, not edit or delete.p  p2 Looping through the allevents list on every DayRender, is that potentially dangerousresource intensive  Does the Calendar control call DayRender for just the month thats being displayed  If so, meaning only 30 or 31 calls at a time, it might be fine.  But if it does something like calls DayRender for the entire year, or the previous and next months as well...Anyway, hopefully you get my point.  Advice on this would be appreciated.p  p3 Is there anything that I could be doing better  I realize I only posted the bare skeleton, but if anyone has any similar experience, or pitfalls they wished they had realized earlier, that advice would be appreciated.p  hr  pAs I was typing up the questions I realized that when I get the CalendarEventList at the page level, I could immediately loop through it and cut out everything except for the last 3 and future 3 months or something.  Problem there is, somehow keeping track of it so that when the user goes back 4 months, Id have to realize this and call the database again.  I have a vague feeling that the answer is somewhere in that direction, but still not sure.p
Negative 23 pIm a little unsure of how to ask this question, so Ill start as best I can from where Im at.  I have a data type, Ill call it program, that I load some core information from a single data source.  I have my loading  caching logic worked out for the central data model, but there are externally loaded nodes that my framework will need to append to the data model based on project settings.p  pWhat Im looking for is a design pattern that will allow me to load these appended data nodes if the project requires it and to not execute the program until all the data has loaded.  I can assume that I will know what the nodes will be in advance and where to get the data when they are required.  My current setup looks something like belowp  precodevar programs  ,     loadCuePoints  function uuid, callback          will call the callback with the data once loaded and add the program         to programs, keyed by the uuid     ,     loadLinkedFiles  function uuid, callback          will append the data to programs[uuid] and call the callback with the         data once loaded     ,     loadProgram  function uuid, callback          will append the data to programs[uuid] and call the callback with the         data once loaded     ,      hash where the key is the node on program and the value is the function      used to load the data, this will be based on project settings, but Im not      concerned with this logic for this question     requiredData           cuePoints  loadCuePoints,         linkedFiles  loadLinkedFiles     ,     getProgram  functionuuid, callback          if programs[uuid]              callbackprograms[uuid]          else              assume the key in the requiredData hash is the required node on             Program, and that the value is the callback method, the functions             in this table sre already set up to load the data and return it             via the callback once loaded               codepre  pI can certainly hack my way through this, so Im not asking for a solution so much unless you have something that works very well or is particularly elegant as Im asking if theres an established pattern for queuing a callback after a collection of asynchronous actions.  Im happy to elaborate if the explanation is unclear.p

Negative 23 pCurrently I am facing really ugly issue.p  pI have ViewFlipper with few semitransparent children. In and Out animations for ViewFlipper are made so that those children overlay each other i.e their alpha values gets mixed. Children are made semitransparent so that background beneath them would be visible so I cannot set background to each of those child.p  pThe problem is I do now want those children to intersect  child that is drawn later should be clipped. Based on that need I override ViewFlipper.drawChild method, and apply animation transformation matrix to view bounds. Next I clip canvas drawing area using complement to previously counted bounds. yet, no mater what I do there appears to be small rectangle that still overlays.

Negative 23 pIm going to take the example of a codeusercode object.  A user needs to be registered, logged in, logged out, edited e.g., email change, etc.p  pSo on one hand I have a codeusercode object, which includes a variety of class variables pseudo, email, etc along with getters and setters and maybe some functions that do not deal with the db.p  pOn the other I have a codeDAOcode class which is the object that directly deals with the database through a variety of MySQL  PDO queries create record, update, retrieve info, etc.p  pIs there any reason to not have the codeusercode object interact directly with the codeDAOcode object  In other words, when the codeControllercode request a database query relating to an existing codeusercode instance e.g., during the registration process, should it simply call a function in codeusercode which itself calls a function in codeDAOcode, or should there be a layer in betweenp  pI have seen examples where the controller calls a 3rd class to interact with the DAO, and passes a codeusercode instance as an arg.  Sometimes instead, this third layer is in charge with creating the codeusercode instance and dealing with the codeDAOcode.  It seems to me that all the functions used to deal with the codeDAOcode could reside inside the codeusercode object.  What am I missingp

Negative 23 pFor an upcoming project with node.js I need to perform various housekeeping tasks at periodic times. Specifically some tasks every millisecond, others every 20 ms 50 times per second and still others every second. So I thought about using setInterval, with funny results many function calls were being skipped.p  pThe benchmark I used is as followsp  precodevar counter  0 var seconds  0 var short  1 setIntervalfunction          counter      , short setIntervalfunction          seconds          logSeconds   seconds  , counter                counter  , missed                seconds  1000  short  counter     , 1000 codepre  pThere is a long timer of one second and a short one that can be adjusted using the variable codeshortcode, in this case 1 ms. Every second we print the difference between the number of expected ticks in the short cycle and the actual number of times the short counter was updated.p  pHere is how it behaves when the short timer is 1 msp  precode20120914T230332.780Z Seconds 1, counter 869, missed 131 20120914T230333.780Z Seconds 2, counter 1803, missed 197 20120914T230334.781Z Seconds 3, counter 2736, missed 264 ... 20120914T230341.783Z Seconds 10, counter 9267, missed 733 codepre  pMany function calls are skipped. Here it is for 10 msp  precode20120914T230156.363Z Seconds 1, counter 93, missed 7 20120914T230157.363Z Seconds 2, counter 192, missed 8 20120914T230158.364Z Seconds 3, counter 291, missed 9 ... 20120914T230205.364Z Seconds 10, counter 986, missed 14 codepre  pBetter, but roughly one function call is skipped every second.

There is this a hrefhttpejohn.orgblogaccuracyofjavascripttimemuch cited Ressig posta and lots of related JavaScript questions, but most assume that the code runs in a browser and not in node.js.p  pNow for the dreaded question what is going on here Just joking obviously function calls are being skipped. But I fail to see the pattern. I thought that the long cycles might be preventing the short ones, but it doesnt make any sense in the 1 ms case. Short cycle function calls are not overlapping since they just update a variable, and the node.js process is near 5 CPU even with a short cycle of 1 ms. Load average is high though, at about 0.50. I dont know why a thousand calls are stressing my system so much, though, since node.js handles a hrefhttpblog.caustik.com20120408scalingnodejsto100kconcurrentconnectionsmany more clients perfectlya it must be true that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6650134issetintervalcpuintensivesetInterval is CPU intensivea or I am doing something wrong.p  pAn obvious solution is to group function calls using longer timers, and then run short cycle function calls many times to simulate a shorter timer. Then use the long cycle as a broom wagon that makes any calls missed in the lower intervals. An example set up 20 ms and 1000 ms setInterval calls. For 1 ms calls call them 20 times in the 20 ms callback. For the 1000 ms call check how many times the 20ms function has been called e.g. 47, do any remaining calls e.g. 3. But this scheme is going to be a bit complex, since calls may overlap in interesting ways also it will not be regular although it may look like it.p  pThe real question is can it be done better, either with setInterval or other timers within node.js Thanks in advance.p

Negative 23 pI have been working on a weather app for several weeks now.I currently have 4 view controllers setup and functioning. Everything is currently linked to my tab bar controller however I need more space on the bar and 3 of the view controllers are similar. Im not sure what the best way to do this is.The 3 like view controllers are forecast controllers, one is a current conditions, one is a extended forecast and the third is a weekend view. what I would like to do is have the current controller linked to the tab bar easy enough and have the option to switch the views to the other options from the current view. I tried adding another tab bar controller but I didnt like the way it looked with two tab bar controllers. I added a picture so you can see how it is currently setup, basically I want to elliminate the last 2 tabs and access them through the 2nd tab.

Negative 23 pI have a datagridview showing baisc document data Name, type, which the user navigates to access each document. A richtext box shows the first page of each document as navigation occurs. However, since there can be multiple pages per document, the pages are managed in a separate BindingSource so the user can flip through them and make changes.p  pIf the user makes changes to either say the document name or to information on any of the pages, he has 2 choices for saving these, either via an Update button or via navigating to another document in the datagridview.p  pThe button is fine because all binding sources are in a static state.p  pHowever, Im having trouble with the second option since datagridview doesnt offer a row changing event. The RowLeave event isnt appropriate since the user may be in a row, but click over to the richtext box to edit a corresponding page which, of course fires the RowLeave event. I only want to capture an event when the user actually changes document.p  pIve tried the Documents BindingSource CurrentChanged and PositionChanged events but they both occur after the Current pointer has changed so I dont have the correct context for the updates. I could have a global CurrentPosition variable which is used to regain context while I do the updates, but that seems inelegant. Being fairly new to this, Im guessing that Ive missed something so any help would be fantastic.p  pThanks, Jamesp

Negative 23 pMy app has several Activities, including codeStartActivitycode which is declared withp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltintentfiltergt     ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt     ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt ltintentfiltergt codepre  pin the manifest. I also have an codeApplicationcode subclass, and it is here that some initialization tasks are kicked off. The initialization code executes in a background thread, so codeStartActivitycode simply displays a splash screen and waits for the background initialization to complete. It is important that control does not pass to any other Activity until the initialization is complete.p  pOccasionally, after my app has been running, it will be sent to the background by the user pressing the HOME key, and possibly some other apps being opened. If my app is relaunched from the launcher after a short while, the app resumes happily in whatever Activity was active when the app was last open. This is fine.p  pIf there is a delay of a couple of hours before my app is relaunched, then funny things start happening. It appears that the process is restarted  I can tell from log output that my codeApplication.onCreatecode has been called, and the background initialization task is started  but, critically, codeStartActivitycode is bypassed and the system has attempted to go straight to whatever Activity was active last time the app was open.p  pThis seems to me like an impossible situation. It should never be possible for the process to be relaunched after previously having been terminated, presumably due to inactivity and jump directly to a noncodeMAINcode Activity. Either the app is alive, and the lastused Activity can simply be resumed without the app having to reinitialize or, the app is dead and should reinitialize from scratch, including launching the codeMAINcode Activity. It should never be in this weird zombie state.p  pIs my understanding wrong, or is Android doing something totally crazyp  psubPossibly related a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2447588androidwhendoclassesgetunloadedbythesystemAndroid When do classes get unloaded by the systemasubp
Negative 23 pI am not asking a general guid vs ints which is better question. I know that, or atleast think I know that they both have specific scenarios where one is better than the other. But I do have a specific scenario where I am writing a chat application. I started the application with all my primary keys being ints. But after doing a bit of research I realized that I might be having a security flaw in the application as I am passing the primary key to a users browser for different entity requests such as chatrooms, talkers and such. One would agree that a subsequent primary key could be guessed and hence it is possible for users to alter other users sessions and states. In trying to prevent this, I was considering using guids as my primary key but then another thought hit me. A thought about performance. Since this is a chat application, is using a guid really going to cost me performancewise if the application comes under heavy load, say 10s or 100s of thousands of users simultaneously for e.g. I am not really informed enough to make a choice here. My question in short is, do I need to change my primary keys to guids to help make guessing primary keys harder or is there some other way that I could secure my application without resorting to guids. If the question is not clear enough, let me know and I will clarify, thanks.p

Negative 23 pI need to develop an Android application and I am a starter to this environment. Actually, we need to port our existing application written for iPhone with ObjectiveC to Android. We are targeting four devices for now Samsung S2, S3, Note and Note 2. The application completely consists of custom images in its buttons and backgrounds. As from my experiences in iOS development, we designed 320x480 and 640x960 backgrounds for nonretina and retina devices and the system selected the correct ones provided we give appropriate 2x suffixes. I am trying to understand the Androids way of handling this. I have read the [Supporting Multiple Screens] httpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.html document, but I am still confused on a few things.p  pAs far as understand, there are size and density categories named as small,normal,large and xlarge and ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi. We need to generate appropriate bitmap resources and place them under correct drawableXY folders. This looks like an advanced version of the 2x notation in iOS. But I dont get exactly how we should prepare background images. For example Note1 and Note2 have resolutions of 449x718dp and 431x767dp respectively if I calculated correctly and therefore they both fall into normal size category. If we prepare a background image for Note1, its screen ratio wont be the same for Note2 and the background image will have to be resized. So, the system does not handle different sized devices which fall under the same size and pixel density category. So, what I do not get is how this system allows us to reuse the same background image for similar devices under the same sizedensity category. Should we prepare separate background images, say, for Note1 and Note2 If so, what is the meaning of this categorization, am I missing somethingp

Think of it as a typical MenuContent app like the default Android Contacts app. MenuFragment Contacts list on the left and some ContentFragment Contacts details on the right. So far there is not too much functionality involved except for setting up the UI behavior. There is nothing happening in the background, no saving of states or similar. Ive basically focused on making sure that the correct fragment shows up when I select an item from my MenuFragment, that the correct layouts are drawn when a fragment launches, and that the correct fragment is displayed when the user presses the back button. p

Negative 23 pAs a out of course project, I am currently developing a kernel in an attempt to better understand all the aspects of an actual OS. So far, I am done setting up a flat physical memory model with support for paging and the basic interrupts keyboard and perhaps trackpadmouse next. I thought the step forward would be to implement a filesystem and I am keen about the ext2. I have looked around, even on SO but there isnt anything explicit that answers my questionsp  ol liIs it possible to write a driver to access an ext2 filesystem in C or do I need to go lowerli liIf I plan to access the filesystem off a USB device, I am assuming I will need to get the device driver for USB running first. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.li liI know the code for detecting a filesystem is already available on the MINIX and other kernels but what I really want to know is if I want to build a custom albeit simple filesystem, how do I go about it I am considering this possibility too. li ol  pMy apologies if the question and details sound a little ignorant but I am still in the learning process.p  pThanks p

Negative 23 pOne of my projects I am developing is a Keyboard hook that traps some of the higher numbered function buttons f13f20.

Negative 23 pI know that codeFormatterServices.GetUninitializedObjectcode can do that, but the core library for xbox does not contain the class.p  pIm working on a XNA game and Im trying to make this work there. codeActivator.CreateInstancecode is available but than I need a default constructor, whats ugly.p  pI thought of if there is no default constructor, I take the shortest and pass in any values for example when it requires an codeintcode and an codeobjectcode, I pass in code0code and codenullcode. But the problem on that is that the constructor could throw an exception if it works with the objects passed in. Well I still could write it in a try catch block and maybe it works that way. But I really unlikely would do that. Is there any other solutionp  pThanks for any help p

Negative 23 pI have an ASP.NET page that needs to push a little data to an MS Access 2003 database.  The process requires a Select on one record, Inserting one new record and Updating one record.  I am connecting to the Access database via an codeOleDbConnectioncode connection.  So far, the Select and Insert functions are working exactly as expected so I know my connection is good.  The Update, however, fails to update any rows.  The function to update the record looks like thisp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodepublic static int UpdateDeviceDatesint deviceId, DateTime nextTestDate      var conn  DbConnect.AccessConnection     var sqlString  WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings[UpdateDeviceDates]     using var cmd  new OleDbCommandsqlString, conn              cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueDeviceID, deviceId         cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueNextTestDate, nextTestDate         cmd.CommandType  CommandType.Text         conn.Open         var result  cmd.ExecuteNonQuery         return result       codepre  pThe sqlString pulled back from the web.config file looks like thisp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeUPDATE tblDevice  SET tblDevice.NextTestDate  nextTestDate,      tblDevice.FirstNoticeDate  Null,      tblDevice.SecondNoticeDate  Null  WHERE DeviceIDdeviceId codepre  pThis query works fine if you paste it into a new Access query window and hit run, so I know the syntax is correct.  I have done quite a bit of testing and figured out that it is the codenextTestDatecode field that is causing it to fail.  When I took that out of the SQL string, it updated the record as expected.  This is disconcerting, because the date I pass through to the Insert function works just fine.  p  pI have looked around quite a bit and the closest I found to an answer was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2653373cantupdatedateinaspxtoamsaccesstableCan39t update date in aspx to a MSACCESS tablea.  The main answer there was to change the parameter to a codeShortDateStringcode.  I tried that to no effect.  It was also suggested to bracket the date in codecode, since that is what Access does in its own queries.  Unfortunately, that didnt work either.  p  pI dont know why either of these should have been necessary, because the date comes through in exactly the same format as in the Insert statement and that works fine.  Im at my wits end here because the only thing Ive found to make that query work is to remove the date parameter which would defeat the main purpose of the query.p

The thing is, in attempting to force the use of a new index that wasnt being utilized, I stumbled upon a nifty trick in DB2 A noop COALESCE in the predicate that can potentially reduce cost and runtime.p  pBasically, it works like thisp  precodeSELECT ... FROM A JOIN B ON A.ID1  B.ID1 AND A.ID2  B.ID2 More inner and left joins WHERE B.TYPECODE IN parameter AND A.X IN subquery AND COALESCEB.TYPECODE,B.TYPECODE  B.TYPECODE codepre  pThe COALESCE does nothing from a logical standpoint and B.TYPECODE is never null. However, this tricks the DB2 optimizer into estimating a lower number of rows, explanation herep  pa hrefhttpwww01.ibm.comsupportdocview.wssuidswg21259831 relnofollowhttpwww01.ibm.comsupportdocview.wssuidswg21259831ap  pAs for TABLE B, the TYPECODE column has about 15 different possible values and the distribution is not uniform. There are about 2.7 million rows in there and about 900k rows in A. As such, the ID1ID2 columns in B may repeat the same value pair up to 15 times or occur only once. The parameter is no more than four values.p  pThe odd thing is that the COALESCE statement cuts the query time in half. In checking the explain plan, I noticed that several table scans on A became index scans, likely due to the lower estimate of returned rows making an index scan feasible to the optimizer. Ive been digging around and trying to find a possible reason for this. RUNSTATS was very recently run on these tables and the SYSCAT.COLDIST table has some pretty recent data in it, at least within 1 of the values if I check the counts manually. I did notice that it doesnt have all of the values from the TYPECODE column in it, but the missing ones occur very rarely and omitting the rare values from the IN clause has no real effect on the query time. Ive tried the COALESCE on other columns, but never with the same effect.p  pThe only explanation that I can think of is that some stats are stale, bad, outdated, etc, but darned if I know where to look at this point. I can say that there are no column group stats in place, but Im not knowledgeable enough to say if thats going to make a difference. p  pI dont want to put that COALESCE statement into production as its a bit hacky and is more of a bandaid on a deeper problem than a solution in and of itself. It seems to me that DB2 is overestimating the number of rows that will be returned in that join, but darned if I know why. I was hoping some others with DB2 experience might be able to shed some light on this.p

Negative 23 pImagine two forms and one grid. Form A consists of comboxes. The boxes show data from database. The user selects the comboboxes and the result is a new record of the grids store. It is also possible to put new valuesrecords into the comboboxes. No database insert Form B consists of several textfields. Its kind of MasterDetail. Grid is Master, Form B is Detail. At the end i want to submit form B and the grids store at one request ajax. At serverside i want to store the detail data and connect them with existing records or even create new records and connect them. I want to run that operations into transaction context.p  pNow i dont know what is goodbest practise. I tried to use the sync method of the grids store and include the form form B values as extraParams. That works, but it is possible that after successfull request i need to do another request with same untouched store only form B changes, so i would have to reset records states. sync performs changes onlyp  pMaybe a simple Ext.ajax.request would to the job, but how to pass the store I can add form B values as param, but i dont know how to add the store Do i need to add every record item to the params config by my own p  pinfo serverside is php, db is mysqlp

And I find the codesynclongcode method which is used to find a sync marker a 16 bytes MD5 when generated at file creation time in SequenceFile when splitting SequenceFile into file splits in MapReduce.   p  precode Seek to the next sync mark past a given position. public synchronized void synclong position throws IOException    if positionSYNCSIZE gt end      seekend     return       try      seekposition4                          skip escape     in.readFullysyncCheck     int syncLen  sync.length     for int i  0 in.getPos lt end i        int j  0       for  j lt syncLen j          if sync[j]  syncCheck[ijsyncLen]           break              if j  syncLen          in.seekin.getPos  SYNCSIZE      position before sync         return              syncCheck[isyncLen]  in.readByte         catch ChecksumException e               checksum failure     handleChecksumExceptione     codepre  pThese codes simply look for a data sequence which contain the same data as sync marker.p  pMy doubtbr Consider a situation where the data in a SequenceFile happen to contain a 16 bytes data sequence the same as sync marker, the codes above will mistakenly treat that 16bytes data as a sync marker and then the SequenceFile wont be correctly parsedp  pI dont find any escape operation about the data or the sync marker. How can SequenceFile be binary safe Am I missing somethingp
Negative 23 pI am a little bit confused by chosing the right design pattern for my problem. Here is my codep  precodeltphp  class ReportJournal ... class ReportRecommendation ... class ReportCustomer ...  type  journal  value can also be recommendation or customer  gt codepre  pNow I want to create the correct object for that specific type, means in that case ReportJournal. I was thinking of the factory pattern, but what I do not like about a factory are its dependencies that are not injected but defined inside the class.

Negative 23 pWe use class based views for most of our project.  We have run into an issue when we try and create a CSV Mixin that will allow the user to export the information from pretty much any page as a CSV file.  Our particular problem deals with CSV files, but I believe my question is generic enough to relate to any file type.p  pThe problem we are having is that the response from the view is trying to go to the template say like codefrom django.views.generic import TemplateViewcode.  We specify the template in the codeurls.pycode file.p  precodeurlr, MyClassBasedView.asviewtemplatenamemytemplate.html codepre  pHow can you force the response to bypass the template and just return a standard codeHttpResponsecode  Im guessing youll need to override a method but Im not sure which one.p  pAny suggestionsp  pEDIT1  It appears that I was unclear as to what we are trying to do.  I have rendered a page via a class based view and the user will see reports of information.  I need to put in a button Export to CSV for the user to press and it will export the information on their page and download a CSV on to their machine.p  pIt is not an option to rewrite our views as method based views.  We deal with almost all class based view types DetailView, ListView, TemplateView, View, RedirectView, etc.p

Negative 23 pI am implementing a ClientServer API with long job processing times order of minutes in some cases. Some of api calls are short and respond immediately but a coupe require some backend processing. I am using node.js as the web server. My current implementaion is as follows  p  pClientbrowser lt node js lt engine p  pThe engine is a backend process which processes each job C code. All the interactions are http. Now, traditionally I would implement the long jobs as async ajaxrestful requests and short jobs as sync restful requests.p  pI am going to have status updates for the long processing jobs processing large data  like intermediate results, percent complete etc.p  pI am loolking at WebSockets as an alternative and I am relatively new to it. Here are my questions  p  ol liShould I look into websockets for the long jobs instead of the async restful api I would love to avoid handling clienttimeouts, longpolling etc. li liHow about moving all the requests to websockets why bother with rest at all li liIn general, any best practices to implement this architecture. Previously, I worked on projects with the interaction between the webserver and engine as a simple TCP connection with custom commands.li ol  pNOTE I am not worried about crossbrowser support especially the older versions right now.p

Im working on a project with cakePHP where it will allow users to log there drug use. Be it alcohol, caffeine, or whatever else. When people add a log, they select the substance from a drop down, they then enter the amount they took, and then type in the unit they choose to use for the measurement.p  pFor example someone can choose Alcohol from the drop down, then enter in 12 for the dose, and then mL for the unit.p  pIve been working on ways to refine the way my data is structure so that when I have many entrys, its easy to mold them to what I need them for. I will be using the data to generate graphs and charts for the users but that is unreleated.p  pI need help with figuring out the best way to organize this datap  pMy current structure is like this.p  pMy tablesp  precodedrugs id  drug 1    Alcohol  records id  dose  unit  userid 2    12    mL     3   recorddrugs id  recordid  drugid 4       2         1 codepre  pI have these tables associates. So strongdrugsstrong is a list of all the available drugs provided in the drop down, the strongrecordsstrong table is where they can store the dose and unit and some other misc stuff, and the strongrecorddrugsstrong basically pairs the record with the drug.p  pSome problems I havep  pstrong1strong. Lets say a use has multiple records for alcohol, I made a small script that adds all there alcohol doses, and then displays to them the total amount of alcohol theyve recorded. If I do a simple findlist I can get the drug name, and the total amount of dose, but then I cant get the unit associated with the drug. Because it seems like a foreach statement only supports passing two variables.p  pstrongEDIT MORE INFOstrong My find is pretty complex looking but what it does is go through my three tables listed above and grabs 3 fields. It is displayed like this in an arrayp  precodearray mL gt array     Alcohol gt 12 , codepre  pThen, in my view I try to loop these results in a foreach to display my data like this.p  precodeAlcohol 12 ml codepre  pI know how to format it and echo the variables I just dont know how to grab the three values in the array I need, and then put them into the echo.p  pstrong2strong. What if id like to pair up many similar type of drugs. For example if I added Beer, Whiskey, Rum to the list. All of these are in the same category and I would like to use these categories for certain features.p  hr  pA solution ive been thinking of would be to also make the units part of another dropdown menu. And then only have one unit associated with the drug. So id probably change my drugs table top  precodedrugs id  drug  unit 1  Alcohol mL codepre  pBut then, that leaves no room for customization for the user setting the unit. Maybe he wants to measure in beers, maybe he wants to measure in shots.p  hr  pstrongEdit 2strongp  hr  pIve been working on normalizing my database heres the resulting layoutp  precoderecords id  date  title  userid 1   Jan   Title  1  units id  unit 1   mL 2   l  drugs id  drug 1   Alcohol  recorddrugs recordid  drugid  unitid  dose 1          1        2        5  There is a users table, but it is unrelated, and correctly formatted. codepre  pFew questions p  ol lipFor the first three tables above, for the id field. Should I name it tablenameid or just idpli lipThe title field will be a title that the user can choose to enter if theyd like to title there entry. Is it in the correct formpli lipHow does a unit relative value workpli ol  pstrongI appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. I, of course, do not expect to have an entire solution to my problem just handed to me.

Please help mep  pNote Im not sure if this is relevant, but Ive run cmd on another computer connected to the same router via wifi and executed the command ping 192.168.0.107, which seemed to run fine...p  pstrongEDIT strong My httpd.conf file can be found here a hrefhttppastebin.comh639eFgA relnofollowhttppastebin.comh639eFgAa.

The problem probably had something to do with port 80 of my PC somehow being blocked by my router or some application I think.p

Negative 23 pI have a collection view controller with a vertical flow layout, which has some custom layout attributes to warp it into a semicircle, but is otherwise fairly normal.  Under iOS 6, codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode is called precisely twice, once when the view is initialised, and again after it has got its data.  But under iOS 7, it is then getting called repeatedly whenever the collection view scrolls, whether with finger down or under its own momentum.  It looks like it could be once per didscroll.  Does anybody know the reason why this might be happening in 7p

The separators of the cells are set to be white in color, and the table view initially appears with the correct separator color.

Negative 23 pI have a large workbook full of employee information for keeping track of employee certifications.  What I am wanting to do it to link the employee certification information on different sheets to one master sheet.  I have been able to create links and use the data, but when I sort the employees by last name, the links from the other sheets are not staying with the employees, it is staying with the cell reference from the corresponding sheet, therefore not providing correct information for employees.  This creates a problem for me when I am adding in new employees and sorting the list by the last names.  Please help.p

Negative 23 pI am working with openCV on Android platform.With the tremendous help from this community and techies i am able to successfully able to detect a sheet out of the image.         These are the step i used.p  precode1.Imgproc.cvtColor  2.Imgproc.Canny  3.Imgproc.GausianBlur  4.Imgproc.findContours  5.Imgproc.approxPolyDP  6.findLargestRectangle  7.find the vertices of the rectangle  8.find the vertices of the rectangle topleft anticlockwise order using center of mass approach  9.find the height and width of the rectangle just to maintain the aspect ratio and do warpPerspective transformation. codepre  pAfter applying all these steps i can easily get the document or the largest rectangle from an image but this highly depends on the difference in the intensities of the background and the document sheet.As Canny edge works on the principle of intensity gradient ,a difference in intensity is always assumed from the implementation side.That is why Canny took into the account the various threshold parameters.p  ol liLower Thersholdli liHeigher Thershold li ol  pSo if the intensity gradient of a pixel is greater than the Higher Threshold,it will be added as an edge pixel in the output image.A pixel will be rejected completely if its intensity gradient value is lower than the Lower Threshold.And if a pixel have a intensity between the lower and higher threshold ,it will only be added as a edge pixel if it is connected to any other pixel having the value larger than the Higher Threshold.p  pMy main purpose is to use Canny edge detection for the document scanning so i want to know how to compute these threshold dynamically so that it can work with the both cases of dark and light background.p  pI tried a lot by manually adjusting the parameters , but i couldnt find a relation ship associated with the scenarios.p  pHope i clear my point ,and Thanks in advance p

Negative 23 pI am facing an issue while trying to open a drill through report window using Javascripts window.open function. It works fine in Chrome and the new report window pops up when I click on the hyperlink but nothing happens in IE. The parent page is embedded in a web page using IFrame and through go to URL hyperlink it takes to the drill through report.p  pI am using SSRS2008 R2. The parent report has a hyperlink on one of the columns and in the action I have mentioned javascript to popup drill through report in a new window. I pass a parameter to run the drill through report.p  pHeres the javascript which I tried usingp  pjavascriptvoidwindow.openhttpmywebsite.comReportServerPagesReportViewer.aspxAvailableOrdersDrillDownReportrsCommandRenderrcParametersfalseOrderNumber1234,OrdersDrillDown,innerWidth860,innerHeight500,blankp  pI also tried using this script javascriptvoidwindow.openhttpmywebsite.comReportServerPagesReportViewer.aspxAvailableOrdersDrillDownReportrsCommandRenderrcParametersfalseOrderNumber1234,OrdersDrillDown,innerWidth860,innerHeight500,blankp  pNone of these work in IE. However, if I directly paste only the javascript in IE  address bar and try from there, it works. Is this a know problem with IE when using SSRS drill through via javascript Can this be achieved by any other way if this doesnt work at allp

Negative 23 pWhen representing data models through a RESTful interface it is understood to create top level endpoints that associate to a typegroup of objectsp  ul liusersli licarsli ul  pWe can reuse HTTP verbs to enable actions upon these groups GET to list, POST to create, etc. And when representing a model with a dependency being that it cant exist without a parent, we can create deeper endpoints to represent that dependency relationshipp  ul liusers[id]tokensli ul  pIn this case, it makes sense to not have a toplevel endpoint of codetokenscode, as they shouldnt be able to exist without the user.p  pManytomany relationships get a bit more tricky.

The issue is that if I run the program, say N times, then on some of the runs, the first file gets imported but not the second, on other runs the second gets imported but not the first note that if the first doesnt get imported, the program stops. strongBefore I explain the errorstrong, please know that there is no issue with the AIFF files, for the sake of this problem you can assume they are identical and that even their absolute paths and filenames are identical except one has a suffix codeA.aiffcode and the other codeB.aiffcode.

This is working exactly like it was before I changed it.  The socket still closes on an orientation change, and I have no idea why.p  pstrongUpdate  Code and descriptionstrongp  pI added the code changes recently made for StartStop service and STARTSTICKY.  I also recently read a very good article explaining how the orientation change process flow works and why its NOT a bad idea to add the codeandroidconfigChangesorientationscreenSizecode line to your manifest. So this fixed the orientation issue, but its still doing the same thing if I put the activity into background mode, and then bring it back to the foreground.  That still follows the same SaveDestroyCreate process that the orientation does without that manifest line...and it still closes my socket, and I still dont know why. p  pI do know that it doesnt close the socket until the recreate process...I know this because the message queue will display messages that were received while the app was in the background, but once I bring it back forward it closes the socket and nothing else can be sent or received.p

Negative 23 pIm planning on writing a servlet application meant for deployment with OSGI and use some filters for HTTP header preprocessing. While originally settled on the javax.servlet filter implementation, it occured to me that I actually dont know whywhen one would choose to use that vs the Jersey ContainerRequestFilter.  Granted the latter comes with some prebuilt filters, but arguably so does the former eg Cors filter. Thus, what should be considered when choosing which API to use Are there specific cases when one should not be used in favor of the otherp

Negative 23 pSo I have a problem. I have my own CustomMembership class that i use in virtually all of my MVC applications, and this custom class inherits MembershipProvider. p  peach app has its own user database and so the user information is rarely replicated across the individual applications, unless people have accounts in each. At any rate, since deploying them, I realize more and more, that the HttpContext is replicating across these applications over the IIS. I have 2 major problems p  ol liSomeone will sign in as user1, yet the HttpContext is returning a username for user3li liThe User context from one application will be in cache or a session, or whatever, and then show up in another application. Eg. I was about to test an application and it gave me an exception when fetching the user roles because the username it was searching for does not exist in this application, but another, and for some reason is being touting as the current context. li ol  pThis is perplexing, I was wondering if I am missing something or failed to initialize something.

All text data is coming through as NULL with the codeODBCDataReader.GetValueintcode method.p  pHeres the basic structure of the codep  precodepublic static void test      OdbcDataReader DataReader     try              using OdbcConnection ODBCConnection  new OdbcConnectionDriverMicrosoft Excel Driver .xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsbDBQ  filename                       ODBCConnection.Open             OdbcCommand Command  new OdbcCommandSELECT  FROM [  sheetName  ], ODBCConnection              Command.CommandType  System.Data.CommandType.Text             DataReader  Command.ExecuteReader              while DataReader.Read                              field0  DataReader.GetValue0.ToString                 field1  DataReader.GetValue1.ToString                 field2  DataReader.GetValue2.ToString                 field3  DataReader.GetValue3.ToString                 field4  DataReader.GetValue4.ToString                                catch Exception ex              throw ex       codepre  pcodefield4code is the field in question, and all the data for the other fields are passing properly through the code.GetValueintcode method.  p  pHow can I override the data type for this field prior to the SELECT statement  Thanksp
Negative 23 pI am trying to do the exact same thing in python as what I can in JavaScript. In JavaScript I can easily draw on a canvas and then use toDataUrlimageFormat, quality to get the image in base64 encoded string. p  pIs there anything in Python that can do the exact same thingp  pI have done this in Pythonp  precodefrom PIL import Image,  im  Image.newL, width, height output  StringIO im.saveoutput, JPEG, quality89 codepre  pbut the output is not in JPEG format. I believe that it is in PNG.p  pSo is there anyway that I can perform the same thing as what the todataurl url does I need this to be in jpeg and at a specific quality.p  pIf anyone has any ideas on how to go about this, it will be much appreciatedp
Negative 23 pI wrote a shell script that Im distributing to my friends. On my computer, it works great, because I set the default application for shell scripts to be Terminal. However, when my friends open it, the script opens in TextEdit. Is there a way to add an argument to the shell script before it launches so it  opens in Terminal instead of a text editorp  pThanksp  pPS, I did chmod ax to the file. I also made sure to add binsh to the script. Ive also been testing with using the extensions .command, .cmd, and .tool. That would solve my problem except then Gatekeeper wont let the script run because Im not a registered Apple Developer.p
Negative 23 pHeres my situation Ive got a field that once the user double click, itll edit the field. Thats fine and working. Ive got two functions codeokcode and codecancelcode. Cancel disables the editing mode. ATM, the user has to click cancel to disable the editing mode. What Id like to is to allow the editing mode to be disabled when the user clicks anywhere else on the page. How can I accomplish this with Angularp  pEDIT Im adding my markup Note this is Jadep  precodetrngrepeatuser in users  filtersearchTexts      tdngdblclickeditItemuser, hmdoubletapeditItemuser, ngblurcancelEditing          spannghideuser.editing user.name          formngsubmitdoneEditinguser, ngshowuser.editing, classinlineediting2, ngblurcancelEditing              inputtypetext, classformcontrol, ngmodeluser.name          buttonclassbtn btnsuccess mr1, ngshowuser.editing, ngclickdoneEditinguser              spanngclickdoneEditinguser.fa.facheckcircle          buttonclassbtn btnwarning mr1, ngshowuser.editing, ngclickcancelEditinguser              spanngclickcancelEditinguser.fa.fatimescircle codepre  pAs you can see, Ive got a hgrepeat on user. When double click on the codetdcode element it makes codeuser.editingcode true so the form shows up. the codecancelEditingusercode makes the variable false and only the field is displayed. p  pIve added codengblurcancelEditing on thecodetrcode,codetdcode,codespancodeandcodeform and none of it worked.p  pAny ideas what am I missingp

Negative 23 pI have a fiddle here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netqbr3oty6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netqbr3oty6ap  pThe headers are schools.  If you click on the header the .content div reveals a list of dates.  If you select a date, the .content div remains open so that you know you selected it, while you browse through others you may select up to three.p  pMy predicament is, if you select two dates from the same school for instance, two from Archbishop John Carroll, then I click Archbishop Wood and select a date from there, then uncheck one of the dates from Archbishop John Carroll WITHOUT clicking on the header first  the div closes. It would be fine if nothing was checked off, but since I checked off two events, unchecking one should not make the div collapse.  How can I alter my JS to make this workp  ul liheaders are only .active if youve clicked to reveal its content  it stays open if youve checked a box by adding the .selected class to the .head and .content.

Negative 23 h2Backgroundh2  pI have some ListViews and LinearLayouts, each has dividers between items.p  h2The problemh2  pWhen selectingchecking an item, I would like to know how to have its dividers above and below it to become hidden invisible, but still take spacep  pThe reason for this is that the items have a selectedbackground using a selector which, together with the dividers, look pretty bad.p  pIn short I want to avoid this scenariop  ul liitemli lidivider li liitemli lidividerli listrongselecteditemstrongli lidividerli liitemli lidividerli liitemli ul  pInstead, I wish to have thisp  ul liitemli lidividerli liitemli listrongselecteditemstrongli liitemli lidividerli liitemli ul  pThis looks even worse in case I use androiddividerPadding , which shows something like thatp  ul liemptyspace, divider, and again emptyspaceli listrongselecteditemstrongli liemptyspace, divider, and again emptyspaceli ul  pThe problem is that I cant find out how to do such a thingp  pIve noticed that Google handled this issue on the Play stores app, inside the navigation drawer They removed the dividers, and set the selected items to simply be bold. On most cases though, this isnt handled p  h2The questionh2  pIs there a way to do it, other than putting the dividers in the views and updating their visibility according to which item is being selectedchecked p  pIs there maybe a workaround of making the selector take a bit more space than it really needs, so that when the item is selected, it will be on top of the dividersp

Negative 23 pI have a consistent hashing router scalaakka that assigns a particular message type codeacode to a particular set of perrequest actors codeAcode, and a message typecodebcode to a particular set of perrequest actors codeBcode... etc. Question is how do I appropriate the set of actors codeAcode to a its own thread codeAcode, and the set of actors codeBcode to its own thread codeBcodep  pThe hope is that actor set codeAcode does not block actor set codeBcode and codeBcode does not block codeAcode. Sadly, my Akka dispatcher experience lacks, as does my multithreading experience. Thanks.p

Negative 23 pI have an iOS app that was developed using the Flash IDE and AIR 4.0.0.1390 for iOS. When I installed it on a device with iOS 8, upon launch I received the dialog box that the app wanted to send push notifications. This did not happen when I installed the same app on iOS 7.p  pWhats particularly weird is that I checked the provisioning profile and the App ID, and it says that push notifications are disabled for that app ID its a wildcard app ID. So I wonder if it is an issue with iOS 8 itself.p  pIn any event, Id like to figure out if there is a workaround to make sure that the app is not added to the notification center.p

Negative 23 pIm trying to access PHP session variables using jQuery so that I can redirect a user using jQuery instead of PHP.  Right now, when a user logs in, a PHP script runs which checks a database for their logged in and registered status.  If the user is already logged in, they are redirected to a denied page using PHP and redirected to the registration page if they are not registered.  If the login attempt is successful, the user is redirected to their profile page.

Negative 23 pIve implemented simple updateinsert query like thisp  precode NOTE time is replaced in real code, ids are placed statically for example purposes  set statusid1 to existing rows, update others UPDATE accountaddresses SET statusid  1, updatedat  time WHERE accountid  1   AND addressid IN 1,2,3   AND statusid IN 2   filter values according to what that update query returns, i.e. construct query like this to insert remaining new records INSERT INTO accountaddresses accountid, addressid, statusid, createdat, updatedat SELECT accountid, addressid, statusid, createdattimestamptz, updatedattimestamptz FROM VALUES 1,1,1,time,time,1,2,1,time,time AS subaccountid, addressid, statusid, createdat, updatedat WHERE NOT EXISTS    SELECT 1 FROM accountaddresses AS aa2   WHERE aa2.accountid  sub.accountid AND aa2.addressid  sub.addressid  RETURNING id   throws  PGUniqueViolation ERROR  duplicate key value violates unique constraint ...  DETAIL  Key accountid, addressid1, 1 already exists. codepre  pThe reason why Im doing it this way is the record MAY exist with codestatusid2code. If so, set codestatusid1code. Then insert new records. If it already exists, but was not affected by first UPDATE query, ignore it i.e. rows with codestatusid3code.p  pThis works nicely, but doing it concurrently, it crashes on duplicate key in race condition.

Negative 23 pI have a design question. I am using jenkins to automate tasks. Lets say someone wants to perform taskA, he would run a pexpect file using jenkins and everything would be done automatically. Some of these tasks require to switch unix user and I was wondering if there is a more nice and secure way to getset passwords for these users instead of just putting them in a property file. The solution I have right now is to ask the user to set the password in jenkins before running the task, and to put the passwords in a property file which will be used by the pexpect file. I know its very bad to hardcode passwords but this is for internal tasks test only so if there is no other way to do it Ill probably go for that option.p  pThanksp

Negative 23 pI am an R novice and have been running into a brick wall with what should be a simple for loop process.  Data consists of a list with dimensions of 81161 by 9.  The observations are of individuals over time.  The current need is to isolate an unique group of observations and randomly extract one of the observation data points.  At this stage I have reviewed and been attempting a few options none of which are being executed property.  First the for loop then apply.p  pTo provide a better idea of the workflow I have outlined.  This should be a relatively straight forward splitapplycombine.  The apply is a sample with restriction to unique individualdays.  To do this the code goes through the basic defining of over all dimensions, then defining of unique values, a sort and rank from which the unique individualsday are set to an ordianl scale and then these are linked back to the originsl data using the individualsday as the key.  From this point I have attempted two alternatives with the for loops  first using a split by rank to provide DSrank1, 2, 3...n attempted to be used in example 2 and using the subset seen in example 1.  A single sample would then be extracted at random and collated into a subdataset.  From this point other analysis will be performed.p  precode example 1 for loop  SDS lt list fori in 1lengthUID   SDS[[i]] lt  samplenrowSplitDS[i], 1, replaceFALSE  SDS[[i]][Samples] lt i   headSDS   example 2 for loop  SDS lt list fori in 1lengthUID  SubSDID lt subsetDSID, DSrank  i,  SDS lt samplenrowSubSDID, 1, replaceFALSE   headSDS   example 3 apply subset  bootstrap lt lapply1lengthUID, functioni  samp lt sample1nrowDSIDDSrank, rep  TRUE DSIDDSrank[sampl, ]   codepre  pThese have been based off examples I have found through CRAN, stackoverflow, and other Rcode search results.p  pIf you have any suggestions, tips, or tricks that you could share it would be greatly appreciated.p  pMBp

Negative 23 pI am in the process of setting up an auto scaling group in AWS with a custom AMI.

Any advice for the best way to carry this process out I would appreciate some guidancep  pAs for deployment of new code to already running instances, I will be using Capistrano for that.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 23 pI am writing a voting plugin for my Wordpress site. I would like for a client to be able to vote without logging in. What I have done is I have used codeSERVER[REMOTEADDR]code to only allow each client to vote once. Since the voting also uses AJAX, the voting is quick and easy. p  pHowever, I have run into a problem with mobile devices as they dont have unique IP addresses. What solution can I use to make sure that people cannot spam the vote button or if someone double clicks on it, that two votes are not registered etc. on a mobile devicep  pThis does not need to be a foolproof method. I realize that codeSERVER[REMOTEADDR]code is not foolproof either although if anyone has any foolproof ideas that can be implemented easily, Id love to hear those as well.p

Negative 23 pThis is a bit of a strange question  Im designing an ad production specification sheet and template for a clients clients. I have good basic knowledge of HTMLCSS, and could probably cobble together a rudimentary JS plugin if need be. This client requested that I use PowerPoint for this template, but Id much rather attempt to do this with an HTML form. TLDR  heres my questionp  pWould it be possible to provide a zipped folder containing a localized site that allows his clients to drop their media and text into an HTML form p  pI know this isnt optimal, but I lack serverside experience and he probably wont be willing to pay someone to do backend work that is, I doubt we could add this form to his website. I suppose Id need to write a plugin to process the input, place it into a specified folder, and then display a screenshot of the media and text integrated into the UI that it will eventually be displayed in.p

In the example above, if a model was configured to use the localMysql connection, then both localMysql and remoteMysql would attempt to connect at run time.

Negative 23 pI need to develop a 3D mappingvisualisation system that tightly integrates with Google Mapslike functionality. I need the ability to change the angle of view to the ground instead of the fixed perpendicular on Google Maps and then render content above ground e.g. to show an aircraft or some other content actually floating above the ground at a given elevation and possibly in 3D, it might just be 2D labels.

Negative 23 pI am working on a project involving OCRing handwritten digits which uses a typical preprocessingsegmentationrecognition pipeline. I have done the first two stages manually by adjusting some standard algorithms from codeOpenCVcode for my particular task. For the third stage recognition, Id like to use a readymade classifier.p  pFirst I tried Tesseract, but it was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27321553forcingtesseracttogivesomeanswerreally bada. So I started looking into the progress on codeMNISTcode. Due to its popularity, Id hoped it would be easy to get a nice highquality classifier. Indeed, the top answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13319730suggestionsfordigitrecognitionherea suggests using a codeHOGSVMcode tandem, which is conveniently implemented in a hrefhttpsgithub.comItseezopencvblobmastersamplespython2digits.py relnofollowthis codeOpenCVcode samplea. Unfortunately, it isnt as good as Id hoped. It keeps confusing code0codes for code8codes where it is obvious for my eye that it is actually a code0code, which accounts by far for the greatest amount of mistakes my algorithm makes.p  pHere are some examples of the errors made by codeHOGSVMcodep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.com9oS7Umy.png altp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comDlZp8Qr.png altp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comArhPfDK.png altp  pThe top line are the original digits extracted from the image higherresolution images do not exist, the middle line are these digits deskewed, sizenormalized and centered, and the bottom line is the output of codeHOGSVMcode.p  pI tried to hotfix this code08code error by applying a codekNNcode classifier after codeHOGSVMcode if codeHOGSVMcode outputs an code8code run codekNNcode and return its output instead, but the results were the same.p  pThen I tried to adapt a hrefhttpsgithub.comlisalabpylearn2treemasterpylearn2scriptspapersmaxout relnofollowthis codepylearn2code samplea which claims to achieve 0.45 codeMNISTcode test error. However, after spending a week with codepylearn2code I couldnt make it work. It a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicpylearnusersWLm8pZ2Vb0M relnofollowkeeps crashing randomly all the timea, even in an environment as sterile as an codeAmazon EC2code codeg2.2xlargecode instance running a hrefhttpthecloudmarket.comimageami735bda04ubuntu1404mklcudadl relnofollowthis imagea I dont even mention my own machine.p  pI know about the existence of codeCaffecode, but I havent tried it.p  pWhat would be the easiest way to set up a highaccuracy say, MNIST test error lt1 handwritten digit classifier Preferably, one that does not require an codeNVIDIAcode card to run. As far as I understand, codepylearn2code since it heavily relies on codecudaconvnetcode does. A codePythoncode interface and an ability to run on codeWindowscode would be a pleasant bonus.p  pNote I cannot create a new codepylearn2code tag since I dont have enough reputation, but it surely should be there.p

Negative 23 pI currently have a Travel site built using Asp.Net MVC. The site have many articles and albums with lot of images asssociated with it.

Negative 23 pI have overloaded several compare operators like operator in my class CXmlAttr. Then I wrote generic functions where I used these operators and was shocked that this didnt work in C or not in every case. Then I recoded some generic functions to explicit functions which work with the CXmlAttr type as argument. Additional I decided to use extensive unit test functions to check the behavior in several situations. And there was the next problem.

Negative 23 pIm quite a newbie when it comes to DBs and search so please bear with me. Im trying to implement a search function in Meteor app.  Ive checked through atmosphere and chanced upon these 4 options. p  ol liMattodem easy search li liSearch Source li liElastic search package on Atmosphere heard this is dated li liElastic big data package on Atmosphereli ol  pMy needs are for a simple search, able to handle larger data sets that may have data nesting. For example a task, may have comments or links etc. Full text and more than regex query will be goodp  pI read that for easy search, even with some form of elastic or Mongodb application, seems to be application only for a single Mongo collectionFor example what if I wanted to search across  codeDinosaurs  new Meteor.Collectiondinosaurscode and  codeMammals  new Meteor.Collectionmammalscodep  pAppreciate any advice on the pros and cons on the 4 options above 1 seems relative easy to implement but I,m not sure what it means by using elastic engine a hrefhttpmatteodem.github.iometeoreasysearchdocselasticsearchherea.

Negative 23 pstrongProblem Descriptionstrongp  pI design in SystemVerilog and write the testbenches in the same language. I want to be able to compile my design and test different functions during simulation in the way you would using an interpreter with e. Ideally, I would have a terminal popup upon simulation when the simulator hit some line.p  pstrongPotential Ideasstrongp  pIve looked at the DPIC and it seems like I would have to export all tasks in my project in order to run them from the interpreter. However, Im not sure how to do this automatically or if theres a better way. Furthermore, I have no idea how I would get C to open up a second shell for me to type the SystemVerilog tasks in that I would want to run.p  pThis is a problem echoes by my colleagues and it would make life a lot less painful to not have to wait 10 minutes between compiling just a testbench.p

necessarily ordered.             I do not have control over the file. Thus transactions for a plan for an employee              for different effective dates are no necessarily together or in ascending or descending order             of effective date.            2 Transactions are for different plans and are effective a certain date           3. The effective date indicates the date from which that transction is effective for the employee for a specific plan.           4. The transaction is effective from the effectivedate through the next               effective date of the transactionif there is one  and may end earlier if there is an end date on the transaction.br           5. The transaction could have effective dates before the PFromDate or after the PToDate.          6. Similarly, the EndDate could be before the PFromDate or after the PToDate. p  precode      Objective              Determine the total amount for each employee for the period between PFromDate and PToDate.         See expected output.        Other Notes         1. The total cost is to be determined for the period between PFromDate and PToDate.       2. The general formula to derive the cost for each transaction for a plan for an employee is as follows            No of days div 365 or 366 for leap year  totalcost.            Use PToDate for leap year determination.             This will be added up for that employee to determine employee total cost.       2. If there are trasactions with effective date before the pfrom date, they will not impact the total cost          unless that transaction is effective for part of the period between PFromDate and PToDate.           If the end date of this transaction falls before the pFromDate, then this transaction will also           not impact the cost as it is no longer effective.       3. Transactions with effectivedate between PFromDate and PToDate will be included in determining the total cost as follows           1. The No Of Days for which the cost will be determines is as follows.              From date  will be the effective date of the transaction.              To Date   If the transaction has an enddate and the end date falls after PtoDate, then PToDate                         else, enddate                          If the transaction does not have an end date But there is another transaction for same employee and plan                         with an effective date grater than the effective date of this transaction and the effective date of                         that other transction falls after then PToDate, the To Date will be PToDate. Else it is the                          effective date of that other transaction  1 day.                          Period No Of Days  To date  From date  1day.                               4. Similarly, if the end date of the transaction falls after the PToDate, then that end date is not relevant         in the computation of the period as the employee will be charged upto ptodate as long as the transaction is effective during         the PFromDate and PToDate codepre

Negative 23 pIm working on a plugin for wordpress that I would like to fire every time a custom post of the type job is posted, published, edited, trashed, untrashed, etc. basically whenever there is an update to that post type.p  pIm having a bit of trouble finding the correct action hook to call. I have searched, and from my understanding I cant use for example publishpost because I am using a custom post type, so it should be something along the lines of publishjob. However, that doesnt seem to work for me either, if I go in to the jobs category and publish a draft in the jobs category.p  pSo, I guess I have two questionsp  p1 What is the correct action I should be using in the context of a custom post type.p  p2  a. Is there some sort of action that I can use to encompass all sorts of changes to the jobs category ie post editing, publishing, unpublishing, trashuntrash, etc. b. If not, how would I go about calling addaction for all of those possible actions.p  pThank youp

So much that it started to freeze my computer up. As i said before, it got to 1500 cycles without issue. Around then it was using 80 to 100 megabytes of memory, but after that it started to climb slowly. And by 2500 cycles it was using a little over 1GB of memory.

Negative 23 pIm debugging issues with running our web app in multiple browser tabs and have added a client log using log4javascript. Im now trying to identify which log line is written by which browser tab, so I want to add a unique tab ID to each log line.p  pWhat this boils down to is that I need a way to identify that a browser tab is new and needs to receive a new tab ID. Tabs that have already received a tab ID should keep this ID.p  pBut I have not found a way to store such an ID in a way thatp  ul lisurvives tab reloadsli liis always different between tabsli liworks within an iframe that is hosted in a different domain than the embedding pageli ul  pHere is what Ive triedp  ol lipStore the tab ID in the strongsession storagestrong and generate a new ID if a tabs session storage does not yet contain such an ID.p  pThis works quite well in most cases. However, there are cases where a new tab starts out with a full copy of the session storage of the tab its been opened from. This seems to be the case when the new tab is being opened by clicking a hyperlink that references a new window target, or if the tab is duplicated. In this case we cannot differentiate between both tabs, so that both tabs end up using the same tab ID.pli lipAttach the tab ID to an HTML element using strongjQuery.datastrong and generate a new ID if the HTML elements data does not yet contain such an ID.p  pThis was stupid because it obviously does not survive tab reloads.pli lipStore the tab ID in the strongwindow.namestrong of the iframe that contains our application and generate a new ID if the window.name does not yet contain such an ID.p  pThis doesnt work because the embedding application that generates the HTML iframe tag and which we cannot change sets the iframe name, so the tab ID is lost after each tab reload.pli lipStore the tab ID in the strongwindow.top.namestrong and generate a new ID if the window.top.name does not yet contain such an ID.p  pThis doesnt work because we cannot set the window.top.name due to cross site security constraints the embedding application is hosted in a different domain than the contents of our iframe.pli lipEmbed strongyet another iframestrong within the iframe that contains our application, store the tab ID in the window.name of that iframe and generate a new ID if the inner iframes window.name does not yet contain such an ID. p  pThis does not work because even though we do not explicitly set the inner iframes name when opening it, the iframes name is reset to the empty string upon tab reload.

Negative 23 pId like to profile functions in an installed R package codedata.tablecode using codeRprofcode with codeline.profilingTRUEcode. Normally, installed package are byte compiled, and line numbers are not available for byte compiled packages.

Maybe there is some way to codesourcecode into the correct namespace  p  pAlternatively, perhaps I can build a modified version of codedata.tablecode that is not byte compiled, and then load that in a way that keeps line numbers   What alterations would I have to make, and how would I then load it I started by setting codeByteCompile FALSEcode and then trying codeR CMD INSTALL l Rlib build data.tablecode, but this still seems to be byte compiled.   p  pIm eager to make this work and will pursue any suggestions.

Negative 23 pHi guys I am making a tool which will fetch telephone numbers from the database and make a curlapi request to validate the number and get its info then update certain fields in the database based from the API response.p  pSo I have a table called codephonescode which hasp  precodegtid gtnumber gtnetwork gtcountry codepre  pSo in my table only the codeidcode and codenumbercode which has values, codenetworkcode and codecountrycode is null. Which is the reason I will use API that will update those fields depending on the number. However theres a problem, so basically what will happen is I will loop on all those numbers like sop  precodephone  Phoneall foreach phone as key gt value      Call the API that will get the details in the current number    and update the details in the table for the current number      Some code for API Call     Update Script   update  Phonefindvaluegtid   updategtnetwork  network   updategtcountry  country   updategtcountryprefix  countryprefix   updategtstatus  status   updategtremarks  remarks   updategtsave  codepre  pThat will work fine and do my task, but problem is this is very slow when I looped in lets say, 50,000 records, coz before it can send the next curl request, it must wait for the response of the previous one right Question is how can I make it a 20 request per loop count Coz the API Im using supports 20 request per second so I want to maximize it.p  pI know my loop will change coz I need to get 20 records at a time and not repeating the same records again.p

Negative 23 pSo I have written some code which stops a thread when a STOP button is pressed. It works, with some caveats. It tends to freeze up resources for a second or two and it stops everything as soon as it is pressed. I would like for the stop button to stop the thread once it is finished what it is doing.p  pHere is the function I have created for the stop eventp  precodedef Stopself, event     if myClass.worker  None         if myClass.browserNone             whilemyClass.browser.quitNone                 myClass.browser.quit         myClass.worker.stop         myClass.worker  None         while True             try                 myfile  openself.fpath, r                 myfile.close                 break             except IOError                 myClass.closeItself         os.unlinkself.fpath         os.renameself.temp, self.fpath codepre  pBasically if no thread is spawned hence it is not None, it quits a browser window and then stops the thread which is scraping information from a webpage on the browser.

Negative 23 pI have been working on a Words Formation game sample a hrefhttpwww.popcap.comgamesbookwormonline relnofollowhttpwww.popcap.comgamesbookwormonlinea for quite long. Everything is done, except for one last thing that I can not figure out how to implement.  p  pIn short, I am displaying a 2D grid of Jbuttons with letters one them I have implemented a graphical version of JButton. The user has to form words from the random letters on the buttons, and the score is added. Now when the user can no longer form any words, I want the game to end. The idea I tried using to implement this is as follows  p  pI store ALL the coordinates of the grid in an ArrayList I will call this AllCoordinates. Then, I store the coordinates of the selected JButtons in a separate ArrayList I will call this Coordinates. I compare the two lists, and store the coordinates in the ArrayList AllCoordinates that do not exist in Coordinates. I do not know how I can form various words with so many random coordinates. Could someone help me with a way of doing this  p  pIf you have any better ideas of doing this, I would be grateful for your input.  p  pPSbr I am sorry for not posting the code. It is too long and complicated to be posted here  p  pThanks p

Negative 23 pI have created forms that will allow the user to dictate the constraints of a query i.e. student attendance for their state versus another state with the use of ComboBoxes. The problem arises when I add multiple constraints to the query. I have had intermittent success with 2 categories but it seems only consistent with 1 category. I need three categories but I have had no success getting all three categories to work on the same form.  However, all categories work by themselves if run independently removing some constraints from query. So, I know that the ComboBoxes on my form work properly. It seems the problem is with the querys SQL.p  precodeSELECT  StudentsAllClasses.LastName, StudentsAllClasses.FirstName,      StudentsAllClasses.[Class Name], StudentsAllClasses.State,      StudentsAllClasses.ClassDate FROM StudentsAllClasses WHERE      StudentsAllClasses.[Class Name][Forms][User Input][ComboClass]     AND      StudentsAllClasses.State[Forms][User Input][ComboState] AND      StudentsAllClasses.ClassDate[Forms][User Input][ComboDate] codepre  pI think the problem is with the AND operator in the where statement.  If I change it to OR I can use all three constraints. But, I need the constraints to be cumulative so it it catagory x AND category y AND category Z. Any help would be appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 23 pIm currently building a web app in C with MVC, where I use a Bootstrap modal form for either of two uses at seperate times, obviously.

Negative 23 pWhenever the performance advantages of Lumen compared to Laravel are mentioned, the router component is named as the biggest speed boost.p  pLets keep the possibilites of what the default Illuminate router Laravel and nikicFastRoute Lumen component provide aside.p  pWith Laravel you have the option to cache routes with this commandp  precodephp artisan routecache codepre  pIs the performance boost of Lumen negligible when caching for routes in Laravel is usedp  pSince Lumen can be build up to a complete Laravel install excepting the router component or just replace the default router in Laravel, I dont see any remarkable speed benefits in doing this when the routes can be cached.p  pWhen we are talking about speed, functions like Eloquent for database related stuff or other things too should probably be the same in Laravel and Lumen. Although less configuration options are offered in Lumen or even have disabled features like Facades, the impact shouldnt be significantly higher.p  pIs my assumption correct that they are close to being equal performance wise when route caching is usedp

Negative 23 pI am new to Angular development. I have a list of images which is being retrieved from a remote server and needs to be displayed in two different image carousels. At the moment, I have a setup likep  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerMainCtrlgt     ltdiv ngcontrollerCarouselCtrlgtltdivgt    ltdiv ngcontrollerCarouselCtrlgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pWhere the data is retrieved and stored in the scope of MainCtrl, then used in both image carousels. But that ends up with the two carousels linked together, so that any operations on one are reflected on the other.p  pPlunker example here a hrefhttpplnkr.coedite79x0d2fF5zwx0UwXIxWppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coedite79x0d2fF5zwx0UwXIxWppreviewap  pWhat is the best and right way to fix this, so that the same underlying data set can be used by both carousels, but their interactions are not tied togetherp  pEdited I forgot that about the loose way that parameters can be setdefined. Both carousels were using the same parameter .active to determine their active slide. So when one changed .active, the other reflected the change. Changing them to .activeA and .activeB delinked in in the way I needed them delinked.p
