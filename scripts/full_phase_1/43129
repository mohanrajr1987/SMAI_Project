Positive 43129 pIm using vs2012 and have a project where I have an Entity Framework v4.4 model pointed at a Sql Server 2008R2 database. For a while I have been adding stored procs and functions to the database and using Update Model From Database to bring them into the model without any problems.p  pRecently another developer working on the project started having trouble adding new stored procs and functions  he is using VS2013. When he chooses Update Model From Database, new stored procs show up in the list of procs to add, but when Finish is pressed, they are not added to the model, and in fact if he chooses Update Model From Database again, they are still listed in the new stored procs to add. Same thing happens with new functions.p  pHe was able to get around this by modifying the edmx file manually, but we dont like this solution.p  pWe have looked on SO and seen messages regarding giving EXECUTE permission on the procs which we have not had to do before this. We tried giving the Execute permission, but that didnt change anything  same behavior.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 43129 pIve been toying around with the Parallel library in .NET 4.0. Recently, I developed a custom ORM for some unusual readwrite operations one of our large systems has to use. This allows me to decorate an object with attributes and have reflection figure out what columns it has to pull from the database, as well as what XML it has to output on writes.p  pSince I envision this wrapper to be reused in many projects, Id like to squeeze as much speed out of it as possible. This library will mostly be used in .NET web applications. Im testing the framework using a throwaway console application to poke at the classes Ive created.p  pIve now learned a lesson of the overhead that multithreading comes with. Multithreading causes it to run slower. From reading around, it seems like its intuitive to people whove been doing it for a long time, but its actually counterintuitive to me how can running a method 30 times strongat the same timestrong be slower than running it 30 times sequentiallyp  pI dont think Im causing problems by multiple threads having to fight over the same shared object though Im not good enough at it yet to tell for sure or not, so I assume the slowdown is coming from the overhead of spawning all those threads and the runtime keeping them all straight. Sop  ul liThough Im doing it mainly as a learning exercise, is this pessimization For trivial, nonIO tasks, is multithreading overkill My main goal is speed, not responsiveness of the UI or anything.li liWould running the same multithreading code in IIS cause it to speed up because of alreadycreated threads in the thread pool, whereas right now Im using a console app, which I assume would be singlethreaded until I told it otherwise Im about to run some tests, but I figure theres some base knowledge Im missing to know strongwhystrong it would be one way or the other. My console app is also running on my desktop with two cores, whereas a server for a web app would have more, so I might have to use that as a variable as well.li ul
Negative 43129 pI am working on a program to automate parsing data from XML files and storing it into several databases.

When I run the exact same code on the exact same copy of the database over the exact same network path from my machine, all the data that should be there is there.p  pMy coworker and I are both on Windows XP computers with Microsoft Access 2000 and the same versions of Python, lxml, and pyodbc installed.  I have no idea how to check whether we have the same version of the Microsoft ODBC drivers.  I havent been able to find any difference between the records that are there and the records that arent.  Im in the process of testing whether the same problem happens with the other databases, and whether it happens on a third coworkers computer as well.  p  pWhat Id really like to know is ANYTHING anyone can think of that would cause this, because it doesnt make sense to me.  To summarize Python code executing SQL queries will silently fail half of them on one computer and work perfectly on another.p  pEditbr No more problem.  I just had my coworker run it again, and the database was updated completely with no missing records. Still no idea why it failed in the first place, nor whether or not it will happen again, but problem solved.p

Negative 43129 pThis is an assignment question that I am having trouble wording an answer to.p  pSuppose a tree may have up to k children per node. Let v be the average number of children per node. For what values of v is it more efficient in terms of space used to store the child nodes in a linked list versus storage in an array Whyp  pI believe I can answer the why more or less in plain English  it will be more efficient to use the linked list because rather than having a bunch of empty nodes ie empty indexes in the array if your average is lower than the max taking up memory you only alloc space for a node in a linked list when youre actually filling in a value. p  pSo if youve got an average of 6 children when your maximum is 200, the array will be creating space for all 200 children of each node when the tree is created, but the linked list will only alloc space for the nodes as needed.  So, with the linked list, space used will be approximately the average with the array, spaced used will be the max.p  p...I dont see when it would ever be more efficient to use the array.  Is this a trick question  Do I have to take into account the fact that the array needs to have a limit on total number of nodes when its createdp

Negative 43129 pIve recently started using LINQ quite a bit, and I havent really seen any mention of runtime complexity for any of the LINQ methods. Obviously, there are many factors at play here, so lets restrict the discussion to the plain codeIEnumerablecode LINQtoObjects provider. Further, lets assume that any codeFunccode passed in as a selector  mutator  etc. is a cheap O1 operation.  p  pIt seems obvious that all the singlepass operations codeSelectcode, codeWherecode, codeCountcode, codeTakeSkipcode, codeAnyAllcode, etc. will be On, since they only need to walk the sequence once although even this is subject to laziness. p  pThings are murkier for the more complex operations the setlike operators codeUnioncode, codeDistinctcode, codeExceptcode, etc. work using codeGetHashCodecode by default afaik, so it seems reasonable to assume theyre using a hashtable internally, making these operations On as well, in general. What about the versions that use an codeIEqualityComparercode p  pcodeOrderBycode would need a sort, so most likely were looking at On log n. What if its already sorted How about if I say codeOrderBy.ThenBycode and provide the same key to both p  pI could see codeGroupBycode and codeJoincode using either sorting, or hashing. Which is it p  pcodeContainscode would be On on a codeListcode, but O1 on a codeHashSetcode  does LINQ check the underlying container to see if it can speed things up p  pAnd the real question  so far, Ive been taking it on faith that the operations are performant. However, can I bank on that STL containers, for example, clearly specify the complexity of every operation. Are there any similar guarantees on LINQ performance in the .NET library specification p  pMore question in response to commentsbr Hadnt really thought about overhead, but I didnt expect there to be very much for simple LinqtoObjects. The CodingHorror post is talking about LinqtoSQL, where I can understand parsing the query and making SQL would add cost  is there a similar cost for the Objects provider too If so, is it different if youre using the declarative or functional syntax p

Negative 43129 pI am learning how to use data binding in WPF for a codeTreeViewcode.

Negative 43129 pThis is more a cosmetic issue, rather than an actual problem. Ive got a solution in which I am converting a lot of PageMethods into WebService calls instead. Some of the PageMethods created a page overhead of several hundred kilobytes, so I thought Id extract them into their own WebServices, thus reducing the page overhead and enabling client side caching of the JavaScript proxies.p  pHowever, the project is structured with a lot of namespaces eg. codeCompanyName.Website.Services.MyService.ServiceMethodcodep  pThis translates literally into JavaScript in the same namespaces. In most cases I find this quite nice, but when I have around 20 methods in a service, it becomes quite tedious, always writing the same namespaces.p  pI did a bit of research, and found that I could write my own alias like sop  pcodevar MyAlias  function  CompanyName.Website.Service.MyService codep  pDoing that, however, makes Visual Studio 2010 unable to provide intellisense. It works as expected, but I dont get to use the sweet, sweet intellisense Ive come to love so much p  pSo, my question is this Are there any ways I can provide an alias for the generated proxy like I can with custom typesp  pIve tried using the attribute code[System.Web.Script.Services.GenerateScriptTypetypeofMyService, ScriptTypeId  MyServiceAlias]code It does create some sort of alias, but I couldnt really figure out what impact it would have. Furthermore I dont think thats supposed to be used for static types like the WebService class is.p  pMy requirements are, that I can shorten the generated proxy namespaces while keeping the original in the WebServices, but still get to use intellisense.p  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 43129 pstrongHow should you place one validator on a masterpage that wont allow postback of any content pages until all changed control data on that page has been either saved or canceled.strongp  pThe specifics of my current situation and the way its currently being done on my project are listed belowp  pThis is an IE web application. The application is currently uses CSS behaviors to set HTML Components on certain control types which add properties to the control. These properties are set with the data contained by the control by javascript after the page has been served up to the client. The master page has a validator that uses javascript to compare the data in these new properties with the current values of the controls to see if data has been changed. This is destroying the performance of the app and needs to be changed. The CSS HTML component stuff really drags and is not even compatible with many browsers. Two possibilities im considering pursuing are 1. add the attributes to the controls serverside on init of the basepage, or around there, and then continuing using the current javascript to set them. or 2. using the same javascript that sets the properties to add them as well.p  pIf someone has encountered this issue before or has any better ideas on how i should handle a situation like this please let me know.p  pThanksp

Of course, swapping started.p  pThis is leading me to believe that 1.8.7 simply has a larger footprint than 1.8.6.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strongp  pI put MRI 1.8.7 on a server, it was much worse that MRI 1.8.6 in terms of memory usage, so I immediately went back to MRI 1.86.p  pIve run an average of Rails process size, as listed by passengermemorystats.  The REE 1.8.7 processes were 73 MB larger, which seems rather large.p  pThis means that I need to have significantly less processes running to fit in the same memory footprint.  p  pWill see how they perform with fewer processes.  Im also starting the GC tuning.p  pstrongUPDATE 4strongp  pSeems Ruby 1.8.7 does not support Rails 1.2.6.  The first officially supported version of 1.8.7 is Rails 2.1.  Well know after the upgrade if thats the root of the problem.p

Then I tried with 2 threads to insert 2 millions rows, expecting a similar result around 34min. bUT i gor a result like 7min...twice the first result. As I check on differents forums, multithreading is recommended to improve performance. That is why I am asking that question  is it useful to use multithreading to insert data in local node client and server are in the same computer, in only one column familyp  pSome informations    I use pycassa   I have separated commitlog repertory and data repertory on differents disks   I use batch insert for each thread   Consistency Level  ONE   Replicator factor  1p

Negative 43129 pIm facing a design challenge that I just cant seem to solve in a satisfactory way.  Ive got a class library assembly that contains all of my shared ORM objects using EntitySpaces framework.  These objects are used in 2 or more different applications which is why they are in their own assembly.  This setup has worked fine for 4 years for me.p  pI also have a couple of applications built on the Composite Application Block CAB from Microsofts Patterns amp Practices group PampP.  Yes, I know this is really old but Im a part time developer, onemanshop and cant afford to update to whatever the current framework is.p  pHere is where my problem comes in I have been exercising my OO design skills and whenever doing a substantial refactoring I try to shift from a procedural approach to a more OO approach.  Of course a major aspect of OO design is placing the operations close to the data they work with, this means that my ORM objects need to have functionality added to them where appropriate.  This is proving a real head scratcher when I also consider that Im using PampPs Object Builder DI container within CAB and that much of the functionality I would move into my ORM objects will need access to the services exposed by my applications.p  pIn other words, lets say I have a shared business object called Person original, I know and I have two applications that do ENTIRELY different things with a person.  Application A provides a set of services that the Person object would need to have DIed in order for it to take on some of the methods that are currently littered throughout my services layers.  Application B also has a different set of services that IT needs to have DIed into the person object.p  pConsidering how the PampP Object Builder resolves dependencies using attribute decoration and Type reflection I dont see how I can accomplish this.  In a nutshell, I have a shared object that when used in various applications I would need to inject dependencies so that it can perform certain operations specific to that application.p  pThe only approach I can come up with is to inherit a new Type in Application A amp B from the Person object.  I would then add my nonshared functionality and DI code into this applicationspecific specialized Person object.  Now that I write that it seems so obvious, however its still my only solution I can come up with and I wanted to ask here to see if anyone else had a different solution they would like to proposep  pOne problem I would have with my solution is that I can see myself getting caught up on naming my inherited type  I mean... its a person, so what else would you call it  Anyways, hopefully you will have some ideas for me.p  pAlso, Im not hip on the current technologies that are out there and really, to be honest only barely grasp the ones Im currently using.  So if Ive said something contradictory or confusing I hope you can understand enough from the rest of the post to get what Im asking.p

Negative 43129 pIve got a simple WCF service that lets clientsconsumer applications log in by providing a username and password. If both the username and password are correct, the WCF service provides the client with a GUID. The GUID and the username are then stored as a keyvalue pair within the WCF service. From here onwards, the client sends their GUID with every request as a means of identification.p  pSince Im storing the keyvalue pair in a DictionaryHashmap, this approach would only work if the WCF service is stateful. Question is, are they stateful by default or is there something I have to do to make them behave in that mannerp

Negative 43129 pMVVM pattern is wonderful with MVVM Light better but sometimes I think I dont understand anything. Ive a business application in SL 4 where Ive, by now, 18 VM.. and more to write Im applying the pattern Laurent Bugnion used in his session at MIX11 with SimpleIoc class.p  pA viewmodel is bind to a view name it A but the very same viewmodel is bind to another view too name it B. Viewmodel bound with view A is called in a standard way in the ViewModelLocator. Viewmodel bound with view B is called with a different key so to be sure they are 2 different istances. Besides they are injected with different DomainService so entities bind with controls on view are different.p  pThe view model registers for some messages to keep track of the variation in other viewmodels it interacts, say a selection changed means the user wants to display other things in order to retrive data on DB.p  pThe problem is if I call view A and then view B I register for the same messages 2 times so Ive 2 operations on DB.p  pWhat I think correct is to dispose viewmodel bound to view A when I call view B generally when I close view A. But I dont really know where to dispose it, when and how Ok.. I could imagine when and how.. but WHEREp  pIf youre thinking Im confused, youre rightp

Negative 43129 pIn most cases, languages will not allow manipulations of references to primitives.

Negative 43129 pIm having bit complicated object model that forms a triangle. There is codeUsercode entity that has collections of codeItemscode and codeTaxonomiescode. codeItemcode has a taxonomy, too.

Negative 43129 pAm trying to optimize some legacy SQL SPs against an Oracle view which is built from 6 tables, each joined by the same field, a numeric ID. Some of the tables in the view have an index which is solely this ID field, others do not. p  pIf I create an index on the remaining tables in the view using this field only, and then perform the actual select query using this field as the sole parameter, will it improve performance notably I can post the s.proc if its necessary as there may be other flaws in the SP which may not be solved by indexing alone. The query in question takes around 6 seconds to return 1 row, none of the tables contain a large amount of records, nothing over 100,000 records anyway.p  pThanks in advance,p  pScottp

If strtok sees a pipe symbol, it should increase the count of pipes and go to the next row of the matrix.

My goal is to make sure they dont repeat either the first card or themselves.p  pThis is how I do itp  precode     Array of cards ids to use     var randomCardsIds  []       Get the active cards element id, add it to the array     randomCardsIds[0]  this.activeCardId       Get the current cards collection     var allCurrentCards  this.carouselEl.items.items       Get three random ids of other cards     var i  0     while ilt3            Get a random card element         var randomCardEl  allCurrentCards[Math.floorMath.random  allCurrentCards.length]          Get its id         var randomCardElId  randomCardEl.body.down.card.id         randomCardElId  randomCardElId.substringrandomCardElId.indexOf1          console.lograndomCardElId, randomCardsIds, randomCardsIds.indexOfrandomCardElId           Make sure it is not in the array yet, and then add it         if randomCardsIds.indexOfrandomCardElId  1              randomCardsIds.pushrandomCardElId             i                   Otherwise, the loop will have to run again       codepre  pBasically, in a loop, for each item I check whether it already exists in the array or not. If it doesnt, push it to the array, otherwise, run the loop again. Here is the console logging resultp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtDJU1.png altenter image description herep  pWell, the first thing it always shows the final state of the array as if it is already filled with the results, which is weird. But the most important thing the script does not recognise a duplicate e.g. in the first result, 74 is repeated, and in the second to last, 47.p  pIt only returns something different then 1, when it finds a match in the second position returns 1, obviously. When a match is in a different position in the array, it always returns 1.p  pWhat am I doing wrong herep

Negative 43129 pId like to implement a feature whereby allowing a user to resize a DataGridView column, but without affecting the adjacent columns. Ive noticed in many programs that you can resize a specific column, and all the columns to the left or right will stay fixed in size. This is not the default behavior in .NET though, because when I expand a column, the columns to the right side will compress in equal amounts to account for the added size of the old column.p  pIs there a way to stop this from happeningp  pEDITp  pI obviously didnt explain that the best, so lets try this againp  pI have a DataTable that holds 8 columns, and a bunch of rows. I add that DataTable as the DataSource for the DataGridView. When my form opens up, the 8 columns are spread evenly across the DataTable, which is set to codeAutoSizeColumnsMode  System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.Fillcode. I want to keep the AutoSizeColumsMode this way. The form or the control will not be resized. Only the columns within the control.p  pWhat I want is for a user to be able to resize an individual column like, say, column 3 without it affecting the size of all the columns to the right of it. Default behavior is to resize all the other columns to accomodate for the new change. However, I would like it to only resize the column immediately to the right. This way, it wont screw up any custom sizes that were set on column 8.p  pI saw an application do this properly earlier today, though I wish I could remember which it was so I could take a screenshot. All I know is that when I resized one column in the middle of the table, it didnt change the width of all the columns to the right only the one immediately next to it.p

Negative 43129 pI am using the FB like button in button layout count bubble immediately to the right of the like button, similar to twitter. The count bubble does not show up when there are zero likes, and I have heard in other places that it wont show up until there are at least 3 likes. I am wondering if there is a way to change this so that the count bubble shows up all the time no matter how many likes there are. Since all of the other social buttons do this, I have no idea why this exception should exist. It makes my social button bar look inconsistent. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 43129 pMSTest  Visual Studio generates accessors which appear on the NCover coverage report. They usually have a low coverage in my case.

Negative 43129 pJust to clear it up this is on an actual device and not an emulator. I have a file set up that I store images in and suddenly the device will give a no space left on device warning in the logcat. I can see that I have room left in memory but for some reason it just wont save any more files. Im using small numbers to name the images so I dont have crazy name sizes. p  pRight now I have about 80 or so images in the file before it gives that error.p  pIm thinking I can catch the out of space error and empty the file and I know I should probably do this by checking how full the space actually is and how much room I have left but I havent tried to figure that out yet. p  pAnother problem that I have is that Im telling the app to store the data on the sd card withp  precodeandroid.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory codepre  pbut its storing the data on the internal memory. I have all my permissions set up and everything but for some reason its storing on internal rather than external. p  pSo can some one point me to some info on how check for the amount of memory available for the storage of my app and also maybe some hints on why I end up storing to internal when Im trying to store on external.p

Negative 43129 pOur unit tests extend something like ApplicationContextAwareBaseTest which during the past several years has bloated with lots and lots of mocks and an Spring ApplicationContext which is filled with these mocked DAOs and Services.p  pI understand that this has been a convenient way to do tests and not care about what exactly is always needed for the plumbing to get a new test running. But this also feels like a death march as most tests only use a small part of the provided stuff and tests are getting slower. Id like to refactor this to something healthier.p  pHow would you go about thisp  pBasically Im thinking about stripping the base class to a lot smaller version and then new base classes that extend this that have more specific stuff for certain area of tests.p  pBut is there some way to help this process. The code base is considerably large and Im left wondering if theres a suitable dependency analyzer for this task or if some scripting would help me in finding suitable subsets.p  pIm also thinking if the current baseclass could somehow make the mocking lazy. Like writing an aspect that fires when a mock is touched and only then initializes it. But this is problematic as the mocks get added to the ApplicationContext so the aspect would always be fired.p  pHow would you go about partitioning a big test set with the above described scenario Im guessing this is somewhat typical problem with big codebases. p
Negative 43129 pIs there a data structure like a queue which also supports removal of elements at arbitrary points Enqueueing and dequeueing occur most frequently, but midqueue element removal must be similar in speed terms since there may be periods where that is the most common operation. Consistency of performance is more important than absolute speed. Time is more important than memory. Queue length is small, under 1,000 elements at absolute peak load.In case its not obvious Ill state it explicitly random insertion is not required.p  pHave tagged C since that is my implementation language, but Im not using and dont want to use any STL or Boost. Pure C or C only I will convert C solutions to a C class.p  pEdit I think what I want is a kind of dictionary that also has a queue interface or a queue that also has a dictionary interface so that I can do things like thisp  precodeContainer.enqueuemyObjPtr1 MyObj myObjPtr2  Container.dequeue Container.removemyObjPtr3 codepre

Negative 43129 pI have a Magento 1.6.2 site hosted on 1amp1.  Because of certain installed extensions I must have support for PHP version 5.3, but sadly the available options with 1amp1 are PHP 5.2 or something they call PHP Dev.  A quick codephpinfocode shows that this is in fact PHP 5.4.p  pMy problem is that when Im set to 5.4, the Categories page of the backend throws a 500 error.  Rolling back to 5.2 fixes the issue, but that breaks my product pages.  In the short term I can handle having to swap between them, but this is obviously unacceptable for a longterm solution when the site is handed to the client.p  pCan anyone suggest where this incompatibility might lie, and what steps I might take to fix it  My biggest impediment is that the hosting is on a shared server, and so I am not allowed to look at the Apache logs.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  p  pAs per CCBlackburns suggestion in the comments, I have tried to track the point that the error originates from, but I have to admit that I dont really understand the results Im getting.

It is therefore the maximum value for variables declared as int in many programming languages running on popular CPUs, and the maximum possible score or amount of money for many video games. The appearance of the number often reflects an error, overflow condition, or missing value.[8] Similarly, 214 7483647 is the sequence of digits represented as a United States phone number and is the most common phone number listed on web pages.[9]   The data type timet, used on operating systems such as Unix, is a 32bit signed integer counting the number of seconds since the start of the Unix epoch midnight UTC of 1 January 1970.[10] The latest time that can be represented this way is 031407 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038 corresponding to 2,147,483,647 seconds since the start of the epoch, so that systems using a 32bit timet type are susceptible to the Year 2038 problem.[11]p blockquote  pHow can I handle this situation to ensure good performancep

Negative 43129 pI have a Web Application ASP.NET application developed with C and .NET Framework 3.5 that uses the SAP.NET Connector to call some BAPIs on a standard SAP R3 installation. So far things work fine. The BAPIs are called to insert information in a couple of SAP tables from the Web App. p  pHowever, today the customer requested to add to those SAP tables further data. After reviewing with the SAP team, they concluded that doing such task would require the Web App to invoke several dozens of different BAPIs. As such, they decided to create a Z Function that would take many parameters and insert the values where needed. p  pSince I need to change the Web App, I was required to approve this line of action. However 1 I dont know what a Z Function is, and 2 dont know whether the SAP.NET connector. To solve 1, I googled for a while, yet found no significant result. From what I can tell, a Z Function is a custom ordinary function created by an ABAP programmer. As for 2, I know that the SAP.NET connector can invoke both BAPIs and Remote Function Calls, or RFCs. However I am unsure as to whether a Z Function can be invoked through RFCs.p  pSo this is where Im stuck. Any help on this matter either letting me know what a Z Function is, and how is it different from an RFC, or whether it can be invoked from SAP.NET connector will be really appreciated and will earn my eternal gratitude. p

However, after settingp  precodeself.addresses  [NSArray array] codepre  pthe property is still nil. Funny thing is, I believe this worked well with earlier versions of Xcode. Im currently using Xcode 4.4 4.4.1 and Im not sure if Im simply doing it wrong, or if some property related stuff changed in this context. Id be very grateful if someone can tell me how to do it correctly.p

Negative 43129 pI encountered some unauthorized strangeness working with Scalas SortedMap[A,B].  If I declare the reference to SortedMap[A,B] a to be of type Map[A,B], then map operations on a will produce a nonsorted map implementation.  p  pExamplep  precodeimport scala.collection.immutable.  object Test extends App      val a Map[String, String]  SortedMap[String, String]a gt s, b gt t, c gt u, d gt v, e gt w, f gt x     printlna.getClass a      val b  a map x gt x   identity     printlnb.getClass b  codepre  pThe output of the above is p  blockquote   pclass scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap Mapa  s, b  t, c  u, d  v, e  w, f  xbr   class scala.collection.immutable.HashMapHashTrieMap Mape  w, f  x, a  s, b  t, c  u, d  vp blockquote  pThe order of keyvalue pairs before and after the identity transformation is not the same.  p  pThe strange thing is that removing the type declaration from a makes this issue go away.  Thats fine in a toy example, but makes SortedMap[A,B] unusable for passing to methods that expect Map[A,B] parameters.p  pIn general, I would expect higher order functions such as map and filter to not change the fundamental properties of the collections they are applied to.p  pDoes anyone know why map is behaving like thisp

Negative 43129 pI am developing in Java using Spring for my company. We are developing an application that we have a local LDAP server. The LDAP server will be used to fetch information. However, we do not want the user of the application to know the LDAP structureschema. This is because the customeruser will have their own LDAP server with their own LDAP structureschema.p  pFor example, the customeruser will fetch information through a user interface by providing the LDAP server details that will be used to conect to the LDAP server. Once connected, they will be able to fetch information by executing a query. Now, they will not know information about the LDAP structure. The code that will be written, will be done by executing the user query. If the query is run, then it will return that information, otherwise it will give an Exception.p  pThe problem that I am facing is thatp  pWhen you use Spring LDAP, there is something called AttributesMapper and ContextMapper. In order to use this, I have to pass in a strongly typed object. So for examplep  precodepublic class EmployeeAttributesMapper implements AttributesMapper   public EmployeeAttributesMapper        This method maps the Employee Entity to data stored in the LDAP Server through a Attribute.   param attrs the name of the Attribute to get   return the Employee Entity.   public Object mapFromAttributesAttributes attrs throws NamingException      Employee employee  new Employee     employee.setFirstNameString attrs.getcn.get     return employee   codepre  pThe above code when executed depending on the query, will fetch information only about the cn attribute and nothing else. Is there something else that doesnt require an strongly typed objectp  pI am not sure what to do.p  pFor example, to search for all employeesp  precodepublic List getAllEmployees      return ldapTemplate.search, objectclassperson, new EmployeeContextMapper  codepre  pThis will return all the employees but only set the cn attributes. But, on the customer LDAP server they may not have the attribute called cn.p  pWhat is the best way to do this Our code that we write, acts as a proxy between the user interface and the customer LDAP server.p

What Im having a hard time figuring out how to define this mapping for a resource that will be something like thisp  pcodelth1gtText string with ltstronggtemphasized phraseltstronggt in the middlelth1gtcodep  pI could probably just use the codesioccontentcode type and then rely on the user to bold the emphasized phrase in the editor but i would rather have it be edited explicitly.p  pIs there a way to do this Also if anyone could point me towards solid RDFa tutorials that would be great. My googlefu is usually strong but all i can seem to find are the actual spec, and a bunch of posts about seemingly unrelated usages.p

Negative 43129 pI have a rather large VB6 application that features dragging and dropping controls between sub forms in an MDI application. The problem is the performance is really bad during the drag operation. You can see the element redrawing slowly as you drag it.p  pI first encountered this issue in Windows 7 and after some research concluded that it was a compatibility issue with the Aero interface. I was able to work around it by switching off the Aero effects. Now I am using Windows 8 the problem is back, however, this is no longer any Aero to disable.I have tried stopping the dwm.exe process but this just restarts itself in windows 8, I assume that this is because its required for the stupid ModernUI interface.p  pI am planning to migrate to .NET in the future but its going to be a big job. For now I need a workaround to get this drag problem working in Windows 8.p

Negative 43129 pI have a large list of documents to upsert into MongoDB possibly n  100000. I dont want to create 100000 deferreds all at once, but I dont want to execute and wait for each query sequentially because I have a connection pool to MongoDB and I want to utilize it fully. So I have a generator function that will yield deferreds to be consumed by a codeDeferredLazyListcode.p  precodedef generateupdatedeferredscollection, manydocs     for doc in updatedocs         d  collection.updateid doc[id], doc, upsertTrue         yield d codepre  pThis is the code linking the generation of the deferred upserts, and the codeDeferredLazyListcode.p  precodedefer.inlineCallbacks def updatedocscollection, manydocs     gendeferreds  generateupdatedeferredscollection, manydocs     results  yield DeferredLazyListgendeferreds, countpoolsize, consumeerrorsTrue codepre  pThe codeDeferredLazyListcode is similar to a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comdocumentscurrentapitwisted.internet.defer.DeferredList.html relnofollow titleDeferredListDeferredLista, but instead of accepting a list of deferreds to wait for it accepts an iterator. The deferreds are retrieved from the iterator while only having codecountcode deferreds active simultaneously. This is used to effectively batch deferreds because they are created as they are yielded.p  precodeclass DeferredLazyListdefer.Deferred          The DeferredLazyList class is used for collecting the results of     many deferreds. This is similar to DeferredList     twisted.internet.defer.DeferredList but works with an iterator     yielding deferreds. This will only maintain a certain number of     deferreds simultaneously. Once one of the deferreds finishes, another     will be obtained from the iterator.           def initself, deferreds, countNone, consumeerrorsNone         defer.Deferred.initself          if count is None             count  1          self.consumeerrors  boolconsumeerrors          self.iter  enumeratedeferreds         self.results  []         for i in xrangecount              Start specified number of simultaneous deferreds.             if not self.called                 self.nextsaveresultNone, None, None             else                 break      def nextsaveresultself, result, success, index                  Called when a deferred completes.

Negative 43129 pI am using my desktop application written for Windows 8 in C to provide the readings of different device sensors on clipboard. Now, there is an external application I dont have any control over its structure that my application will be interacting with. Both the applications use a mutual text file as a switch. When the external app needs my readings, it renames the text file to SensorsTurn.txt and puts a trigger word on the clipboard, such as sensors When my application sees that the file has been named such, it reads the clipboard for trigger, collect data accordingly, puts it on clipboard and renames the text file back to  RBsTurn.txt. The problem is, I need my program to continuously check for the name of that file as long as it is running. One very basic way that I thought of was to throw the program into an infinite while loop. But that obviously is a very bad approach. When I see my application in the task manager, it is taking up crazy amount of CPU processing which it shouldnt. Another suggestion that I found was to make my loop a background thread, this was a little more efficient. But the time between two consecutive readings is slowed down. The guy that I am working for reported this The first time I try to write to the clipboard, it writes very quickly but on subsequent writes it takes about 3 seconds I have often had two program communicate with the clipboard. I suspect that your program is not releasing the clipboard in some way. As soon as I am able to write to the clipboard, I change the file name and get your data back immediately. So the problem stems from the clipboard write....

Negative 43129 pI have a game here called mancala but I cannot figure out why when one side is empty why it doesnt add it to the correct bin. The function gameover is supposed to add beadArray[05] to side 1 and beadArray[712] to side 2 and if side 1 ever equals 0 then it is to add side 2 to beadArray[6] and if side 2 ever equals 0 then it is to add side 1 to beadArray[13]. But it never does that when one of the sides empties and then it wont output who the winner is. Any help would be greatly appreciated   Mancala rules here a hrefhttpboardgames.about.comcsmancalahtplaymancala.htm relnofollowhttpboardgames.about.comcsmancalahtplaymancala.htma  except on mine it

Negative 43129 pI have read the posts on this topic on Stackoverflow but couldnt understand the gist. Maybe we can limit their difference to a specific example.p  pThere is a toilet with a lock.  Mutex One thread takes the key goes in. If any other threads need to enter the toilet they wait. The current owner comes out and gives the key to the the guardOS kernel, who gives the owner ship of the toilet to another person.p  pProblem Statement I see that all the people agree that the shared resource must be unlocked by the same mutex in that thread that locked it. But for a binary semaphore, it can be unlocked in any other thread as well.  Now please consider the implementation of a semaphore.p  pFirst person reaches the toilet, executes the wait statement, and the value of the semaphore structure goes from 1 to 0. Now if any other personother thread comes and executes the wait statement, it will block because the value  0. So why is it always said that any other thread can unlock the toiletCritical section specially when no other thread can enter the critical section p

Negative 43129 pIm a fairly novice programmer, and making a Windows Store App. I have an object that contains an codeObservableCollectionOf Tcode that I want to group for display in a codeListViewcode. Using LINQ to return a set of grouped items seems like it would be the best and easiest choice. Every piece of documentation I could find says that Group By returns codeIEnumerableOf IGroupingOf TKey, TItemcode and you set codeCollectionViewSource.IsSourceGroupedcode to True, bind to the CVS and it should all work perfectly. Rightp  pNot so much.p  pI have a class that containsp  precodePublic Property Items As ObservableCollectionOf Item  Public ReadOnly Property GroupedItems As IEnumerable     Get          Return grouped items     End Get End Property codepre  pAnd in the XAML for the page, where codeGroupedItemscode is set as the codePagecodes codeDataContextcode in codebehindp  precodeltPage.Resourcesgt     ltCollectionViewSource xNameGroupedItems SourceBinding IsSourceGroupedTrue gt ltPage.Resourcesgt  ltGrid BackgroundStaticResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrushgt     ltListView ItemsSourceBinding SourceStaticResource GroupedItemsgt         ltListView.GroupStylegt             ltGroupStyle.HeaderTemplategt                 ltDataTemplategt                     lt Template gt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltGroupStyle.HeaderTemplategt         ltListView.GroupStylegt         ltListView.ItemTemplategt             ltDataTemplategt                 lt Template gt             ltDataTemplategt         ltListView.ItemTemplategt     ltListViewgt ltGridgt codepre  pNow, if I bind the codeListViewcode to the codeObservableCollectionOf Itemcode directly, the codeListViewcode renders all the items as expected, following the codeItemTemplatecode. But when it is bound to the supposedlygrouped codeCollectionViewSourcecode, the codeListViewcode renders the groups according to the codeHeaderTemplatecode, but it doesnt render any of the items within the group.p  pIve inspected the results of the LINQ logicp  precodeDim x  From i As Item In Items         Group i By Key  i.SubItem Into Group codepre  pAnd codexcode has a codeKeycode property and a codeGroupcode property, though it is some kind of IEnumerableOf anonymous type rather than an codeIEnumerableOf IGroupingOf TKey, TItemcode.p  pSo what am I doing wrong here Is there another caveat to the VB.NET implementation of LINQ that Im missing Is there a property Im forgetting to set What is the right way to do thisp

However, if this paging system does work well, it has a flaw the list shown in the view is not the full list, but rather what portion of the list the user is viewing based on the page number. The flaw being that if I use a jQuery system to sort the items, it will only sort the items in the current page, and not the total list.p  pAllow me to demonstrate my meaning.

Negative 43129 pEarlier I asked about the same topic, a simple calculator, but the thread now is kind of cluttered and isnt uptodate any more. I hope gets annoyed by this, but I find a new thread kind of useful.p  pI got an JavaScript exercise to do, which is to script a calculator, which has almost the same functionality than the builtin Windows 7 one.

Negative 43129 pI have a parallel code that uses MPI. The proper way to use this code is to compile from source on a PCCluster and then run asp  precodempiexec n X .application options codepre  pUnfortunately some people using this code are nix challenged who find building from source a little daunting dont ask why. These users only use the code on their own desktopslaptops.p  pFor such users I simply compile a static binary on an old enough OS with an old enough glibc that it runs on most PCs running Linux. The user can then run the code as followsp  precode.application options codepre  pSo now my question is that how can I ship mpiexecmpirun along with my static binary so that a user can do something likep  precode.mpiexec n 2 .application options codepre  pThis way they can also take advantage of multiple cores on their desktops. Until now I have been telling them to do the right thing i.e., install MPI and compile my code from source.p  pBy doing some testing I have found that if I compile hydra and ship codempiexec.hydracode along with  codehydrapmiproxycode then I can run the code as followsp  precode.mpiexec.hydra n 2 .application options codepre  pBut I am not sure if this is the right approach Will this cause any issues I am thinking of doing the same thing for a Windoze binary running in Cygwin.p  pThe other option is a VBox image with everything prebuilt but then downloading a large file becomes an issue.p

Negative 43129 pI am facing a situation, where I thought that Maven offers me the correct tools. Either I am wrong or Maven op  pSeriously.p  pWe are writing software to work with a 3rd party lib, lets call it prod.jar. This lib needs an environment that can connect to the prod.jar servers. Obviously, our Jenkins is not and cannot be set up in this way. Thus, when running the tests with the prod.jar, everything will fail, as no connection can be set up.p  pMy idea was to write a simulator that behaves like the real prod.jar and can be used for unit tests, called simulator.jar. Both, the prod.jar and the simulator.jar hold the same packages with the same class names. They only do differ in functionality. I have done this, to enable development and to cover as much on JUnit side on Jenkins. Of course, we also do test against the prod.jar, but not with Jenkins.p  pSo what I did is to create two eclipse projectsp  ul liprodcode with a pom.xml that has prod.jar as a dependencyli lisimulatorcode with a pom.xml that has the simulator.jar as a dependencyli ul  pSo depending on which project you add as a dependency to the main project, either the simulator or the prod code are used. That works fine.p  pBut then we get the error that the build contains the wrong jar.p  pHow can I set up maven, if possible, so that I can use always the same pom, but maybe with different mvn parameters, to use the simulator during the test process and to use the prod code during the build process.p  pI tried with maven profiles, but when using the build jar, it will complain.p  precode    ltprofilesgt     ltprofilegt         ltidgtsimulatorltidgt         ltdependenciesgt             ltdependencygt                 ltgroupIdgtmainprojectltgroupIdgt                 ltartifactIdgtsimulatorltartifactIdgt             ltdependencygt         ltdependenciesgt         ltactivationgt             ltactiveByDefaultgttrueltactiveByDefaultgt         ltactivationgt     ltprofilegt     ltprofilegt         ltidgtjenkinsltidgt             ltdependencygt                 ltgroupIdgtmainprojectltgroupIdgt                 ltartifactIdgtsimulatorltartifactIdgt                 ltscopegttestltscopegt             ltdependencygt             ltdependencygt                 ltgroupIdgtmainprojectgroupIdgt                 ltartifactIdgtprodltartifactIdgt             ltdependencygt         ltdependenciesgt         ltactivationgt             ltactiveByDefaultgtfalseltactiveByDefaultgt         ltactivationgt     ltprofilegt     ltprofilegt         ltidgtrealSystemltidgt         ltdependenciesgt             ltdependencygt                 ltgroupIdgtmainprojectltgroupIdgt                 ltartifactIdgtprodltartifactIdgt             ltdependencygt         ltdependenciesgt         ltactivationgt             ltactiveByDefaultgtfalseltactiveByDefaultgt         ltactivationgt     ltprofilegt ltprofilesgt codepre  pAny help appreciated.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 43129 pPlease forgive if this question sounds basic... Im basically a QA Eng. not a dev my trade, and Im writing tools for testing a voip framework  using Grails.  The tool I built works great, but when i got to the step of making a reports view like a Dashboard, I feel Im just not doing this right.p  pThe problem is, the Dashboard page takes about 20seconds to load.  Its too slow for my stakeholder, who would like this page to load in a few seconds.p  pSo what Im looking for is a strategy to implement a better way to pull data into this gsp page.  p  pHow Im doing this currently is probably the worst way possible... so Im hoping to hear of a better way to accomplish this.  Im looking more for a strategy or an idea of what I should research on how to better accomplish this.p  pThe grails application basically dials phone numbers via some quartz jobs running every 10min to verify the phone carriers complete the calls  the app marks them as a pass or fail as well as getting a fail count over a period of time i.e. the sprint number failed 1 time in 1 hour, 3 times in 6 hours, 10 times in 24 hours, etc. p  pFor the Dashboard controllerpage, in the class I have many queries like thisp  precodedef proxyRowCount24Hours  ProxyScan.executeQueryselect countid from ProxyScan where ipProxyxxxxxxxxxxxx AND dateCreated gt within24Hours,[max 1][0]   def proxyFailCount6Hours  ProxyFailCounter.executeQueryselect proxyFailCount from ProxyFailCounter where proxyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx AND dateCreated gt dateMinus6Hr order by proxyFailCount desc,[max 1][0] codepre  pThe Dashboard page shows data like the passfail, failures per 1 hr, failures per 6 hours, failures per 24 hrp  pSo if I have 30 phone numbers by carrier to call I have 30 queries to get passfail, 30 other queries to get failure by hour 30 queries to get failures over 6hours... 30 queries to get failure by 24hours.  So its a lot of queries.  p  pI return the values and in a GSP called dashboard.gsp, I pull in these returned values.  p  pIt works, but ... its slow.  So how can I do this better  I have a lot of queries, and I think maybe thats the first problem.  p  pIm using the H2 db, instead of MySQL.p  pAlso... Should I be caching the page  Currently the queries all run each time the Controllerpage loads.  p

Negative 43129 pI am implementing a threads pool using pthreads. All threads share a work queue and the host main thread pushes the work into this shared queue. My implementation will be used as a library, it should be able to run any applications, therefore I want the work here be an arbitrary routine with arbitrary number of arguments. I searched this on the Internet but didnt find any solution. p  pPart of most implementations is like thisp  precodetypedef struct    void routinevoid  work routine   void arg work routine argument  work  typedef struct    work work   pthreamutext worklock   pthreadcondt workready  tpool  static tpool tpool  NULL  void threadroutinevoid args    work work   while1     pthreadmutexlockamptpoolgtworklock     whiletpoolgtwork         pthreadcondwaitamptpoolgtworkready, amptpoolgtworklock          work  tpoolgtwork     pthreadmutexunlockamptpoolgtworklock     workgtroutineworkgtarg      return NULL  codepre  pWhen threads are created, they are waiting until a work is pushed into the work queue. In this example, I assume there is only one work in the queue. The problem here is that the work routine has only one argument, although this argument could contain multiple arguments if it is a struct in C. If an application is given, we can easily define such a struct, but since it is a library, it should handle arbitrary applications. The question is how to handle an arbitrary routine which has unknown number of argumentsp  pFor instance, I would like the implementation be like thisp  precodetypedef struct    void routinevoid  work routine   void args  point to a list of arguments   int numargs  number of arguments  work codepre  pand in the codethreadroutinecode, it should launchp  precodeworkgtroutineworkgtargs[0], workgtarg[1], workgtarg[2], ... codepre  pThe point here is that we do not know what routine the thread will execute. It could be any routine. For example, the routine here could bep  precodework1int a  work2int a, double b  work3float a, int c, double b codepre  pAny suggestions on how to achieve this goal Thanks.p

Negative 43129 pIve noticed something very strange about blitting items in pygame. If you have a list of items to be blitted to the screen, if the screen has no colorkey then there is no problem, the framerate stays level.

For example, in dataset 0 the key a is 1, the key b is a, and the key c is NaN, and so on. However, in my case, there is no connection between a, b and so on. In fact, most of the Panda Table would consist of datasets with NaN. The concatenated a might have ten thousand entries, while the concatenated b could be empty in an extreme case. Also, I might have hundreds of dictionaries that I want to concatenate. Finally, the linked question has keys that are present in one dictionary but not in the other. This is impossible in my case.p  pIm wondering, given these circumstances, if the Panda Dataframe approach is still the best way to go, considering Id need to create a dataframe for every dictionary, and the end result would be a dataframe with LOTS of NaNs.p  pThanksp

Ive read a few articles on it, and from what it can tell, it seems that a good way to go for what Im trying to do is to put my various controls within a view, like a contentView with constraints aligned in that view.  Then have that contentView be the sole subview of the UIScrollView.  I have the contentView with constraints tied to the edges of the UIScrollView.  p  precodeUINavigationView gt UIScrollview gt contentView UIView gt Control Subviews codepre  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comkbR0OUX.png altxibp  pIt works fine in portrait, even if I add content in my contentView that requires scrolling to see, but when I go to landscape, it doesnt let me scroll down far enough. Its like the content size gets reset to the frame of the visible area or the frame of the navigation controller superview when I rotate. p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comMZ1OdJs.png altsimulatorp  pIm wondering if I need to check for rotation and then set the content size again at that time  If so, is there a way to get that size dynamically from the view contentView p  pThanks for any help you can offer Jimp

Negative 43129 pI am using MATLAB to write a code that multiplies polynomials. Most parts of my code work however there is one part where I have two row vectors codeacode and codebcode. I want to remove repeated elements of codeacode and then add the corresponding elements of codebcode. This is what I have writtenp  precodeclengtha dlengthb remove[] for i1c     for ji1c         if aiaj             remove[remove,i]             bjbibj         end     end end aremove[] bremove[] codepre  pThe problem with this is if there is an element in a that appears more than twice, it doesnt work properly. For example if codea[5,6,8,9,6,7,9,10,8,9,11,12]code and codeb[1,7,1,1,3,21,3,3,4,28,4,4]code then once this code is run codeacode becomes code[5,6,7,10,8,9,11,12]code which is correct but codebcode becomes code[1,10,21,3,3,27,4,4]code which is correct except the 27 should be a 26.p  pI know why this happens because the 9 in codea1,4code gets compared with the 9 in codea1,7code so codeb1,7code becomes codeb1,7b1,4code and then codea1,4code gets compared with the 9 in codea1,10code. and then later the codea1,7code compares with codea1,10code and so the new codeb1,7code adds to the codeb1,10code however the codeb1,4code adds to the codeb1,10code too. I somehow need to stop this once one repeated element has been found because here codeb1,4code has been added twice when it should only be added once. I am not supposed to use any built in functions, is there a way of resolving this easilyp

Negative 43129 pIm new to Pandas and would like some insight from the pros. I need to perform various statistical analyses multiple regression, correlation etc on 30 time series of financial securities daily Open, High, Low, Close prices. Each series has 5001500 days of data. As each analysis looks at multiple securities, Im wondering if its preferable from an ease of use and efficiency perspective to store each time series in a separate df, each with date as the index, or to merge them all into a single df with a single date index, which would effectively be a 3d df. If the latter, any recommendations on how to structure itp  pAny thoughts much appreciated.p  pPS. Im working my way up to working with intraday data across multiple timezones but thats a bit much for my first pandas project this is a first step in that direction.p

Negative 43129 pIm trying to create a filter that both dulls the brightness down to 30 and also greyscales the image to 90.

Negative 43129 pId like to create a button on a menu bar that can generate a link to a random article from my blog posts much like Wikipedia has. Its for a client, and theyd like to have this functionality on the site. Im not familiar with PHP so Id like to find a way around that, especially since I dont have access to the root user on my server hosts mySQL installation if this is relevant. p  pI had a theoretical solution have a .txt or .xml file containing a list of all the URLs to each of the posts, with a key assigned to each of them. Then, when the user clicks the random article button, the current time ex. 145 is hashed and mapped to a specific URL. I am fairly new to Drupal, however, I was wondering if there was some way to have the random article button use a .c file to execute these steps. The site is being hosted on a server that uses Apache 2, and I looked through some modules that were implemented in C code. Im pretty new to all of this although proficient in C, and spent many fruitless hours searching for solutions. p

This works really well for other users running single core jobs, however anyone wishing to run something with multiple threads arent able to. The single core jobs keep skipping ahead, never allowing say 6 cores to be available. p  pI dont really want to separate the users into two queues i.e. single and multicore since those using the multicore jobs use it briefly and then there are multiple cores left unused.p  pIs there a way in SGE to allow multi core jobs to reserve slotsp  pMany thanks,p  pRudigap
Negative 43129 pSince this has already wasted a day and a half of my life, I am bringing it to the community someone can save me while I still have some hair left to pull out.p  pI am attempting to use parsley.js and it actually works for the most part, except when I simply want to do something as basic as requiring that a field has ANY value.p  pI know that Parsley.js is loading, and I know its working, because for example, if its looking for an email address, and I add one character to the field and submit it, the form stops the submit and correctly outputs an error message indicating I must have an email in the field. As I type an email, the validation works and turns green as soon as a valid email is recognized. So it works just fine for that part. The problem is that despite me indicating that the field is required, parsley seems to let the form submit if there is no value in the field. I would like it to throw an error if the field is blank, thats the part thats not working. But even putting one character in the field causes the rest of the validation to work, but a blank field slides right through. Please let me know any ideas you all have.p  precodeltform roleform action methodPOST classparsleyvalidategt   ltdiv classformgroupgt     ltlabelgtEmailltlabelgt     ltinput typetext dataparsleyrequiretrue dataparsleytypeemail classformcontrolgt   ltdivgt   ltbutton typesubmit classbtn btnsuccessgtSubmitltbuttongt ltformgt codepre  pSeems basic enough right I can not possibly figure out why the require is not working.

What I did with this was to use the iPhone amp iPod Touch preset, check the Web Optimized option, and change the Average bitrate option in the Quality section to 1000kbps you should then save this as a new preset called Android.   Youll also need to change the size of the output video in the Picture Settings optionsI changed mine to 480 wide keeping the aspect ratio and they came out really crisp and sharp. You can see the result of that below if your browser supports it.p blockquote  pIt looks like everything I done same earlier, strongexcept that I used much smaller kbps setting and picture size left default.strong Will later try to experiment which caused to make it work, because still it does not make sense for me how different bitrate or picture size can make it not work. It should be just affecting quality.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Had another problem  when using handbrake and trying to convert many files at once, first file picture width gets converted to what I set, but other files  to the default, maybe some bug or something.  But then I tried another program  Freemake Video converter  it has various params and I tried convert 2 files at once, and were no problems, worked on that phone also.  a hrefhttpwww.freemake.comfreevideoconverter relnofollowhttpwww.freemake.comfreevideoconverterap

Negative 43129 pI want to use ptrace to trace a process with input and output,so I decide to use exec.Com to start a process instead of os.StartProcess. But something confusing me happened,I am not sure if it is caused by gorountines schedule . I sleep 5 seconds,and send alarm signal every millionsecond but test results show it quickly exits. But If I test with a process running real CPU time,it will pass the test.I find the source code of exec.Com,and there are gorountines to pipe stdin and stdout,which is different from os.StartProcess. If I change to use os.StartProcess , it will pass the test. So I wonder it is something wrong with the gorountines running with sleep.

This is where my problem starts.  I have a picture box and when I select a row it will display the photo for that entry stored in the database.  However I have the picture box bound via the designer usingp  precode this.selectedFirearmPictureBox.DataBindings.Addnew System.Windows.Forms.Bindingimage, this.firearmsTableBindingSource, image, true codepre  pWhen I refresh the data, all is well except the picture box no longer updates when I select other rows.  If I close the application and run debugger again it works fine.  Could it be that I need to refresh the binding sourcep

Negative 43129 pWe currently have a solution were we are having more and more the need to store unstructured data of various kinds. For example clients have the ability to define their own workflows where they define what kind of data should be captured of various types...some simple some complex. This data then needs to be stored and are then displayed on a web application with a bit of functionality to modify the data.p  pUntil now the workflows have been defined internally and therefore a MS SQL database was designed to cater for these specific workflows and their data. However now that clients have the ability to define workflows we need to relax the structure of our db. At first I thought that a key value table in ms sql might be a good idea but obviously I loose the typeness of the data being capture and then need to deserialize all the data in websiteMVC.NET.  I am also considering something like raven db but are not sure if this would be a good fitp  pSo my question  is thus what would be the best way to store this unstructured data bearing in mind users must be able to search and editdisplay this data as wellp

Negative 43129 pI have a training set where the input vectors are speed, acceleration and turn angle change. Output is a crisp class an activity state from the given set rest, walk, run. e.g say for input vectors [3.1 1.2 2]run  [2.1 1 1]walk and so on. p  pI am using weka to develop a  Neural Network model. The output I am defining as crisp ones or rather qualitative ones in words categorical values. After training the model, the model can fairly classify on test data. p  pI was wondering how the internal process mapping function is taking place Is the qualitative output states are getting some nominal value inside the model and after processing it is again getting converted to the categorical data because a NN model cannot map float input values to a categorical data through hidden neurons, so what is actually happening, although the model is working fine.p  pIf the model converts the categorical outputs into nominal ones and then start processing then on what basis it converts the categorical value into some arbitrary numerical valuesp

Negative 43129 pI have a problem where a revealed DIV does not close on the first attempt.

However, if the nodes included in their own beacon the identifiers of their neighbours they can kind of share enough information.p  pe.g. In example 2 above, if A can hear B, then As beacon could include B is 250ms after me. Likewise, if B can hear A, then Bs beacon could include A is 750ms after me.p  pWith this style of information this problem starts to look a lot like a network graph problem, where each node can build outwards from itself based on the nodes it can hear and the nodes they can hear in turn. I have looked into things like Spanning Tree Protocol for inspiration but havent had much luck yet.p  h1The problemh1  pAlthough it looks like a network graph problem, the issue is really how to shift the timing of the beacons.p  pIn essence, the algorithm answers the question Should I move my own beacon If yes, which direction, but it takes into accountp  ul liHow hard it is for neighbours to move i.e. if they already have a well optimised neighbourhoodli liHow will my neighbours be moving i.e. will we both move apart, or should just one of us moveli ul  h1Actual questionsh1  pSooooo, after quite a lot of text, my questions really arep  ol liAre there any examples of this behaviour anyone knows aboutli liDo you think that the graph creation is a goodbad ideali liDo you think the graph will just get in the way of what Im really trying to do  space temporallyli liIs gradual convergence a good ideali liIs the virtual slot idea a good oneli liDoes this have parallels to STP, but that we could have multiple root nodesli ol  pBTW Im not interested in RadioMAC layer solutions to this, it really is an application issuep  h1EDIT The End Resulth1  pI never got around to solving this slotting idea.

Negative 43129 pI have a problem implementing a custom asynchronous action in Oozie. My class extends from ActionExecutor, and overwrites the methods initActionType, start, end, check, kill and isCompleted.p  pIn the start method, i want to to start a YARN job, that is implemented through my BiohadoopClient class. To make the call asynchronous, i wrapped the client.run method in a Callablep  precodepublic void startfinal Context context, final WorkflowAction action  ...   CallableltStringgt biohadoop  new CallableltStringgt      BiohadoopClient client  new BiohadoopClient     client.run        submit callable to executor   executor.submitbiohadoop     set the start data, according to httpsoozie.apache.orgdocs4.0.1DGCustomActionExecutor.html   context.setStartDataexternalId, callBackUrl, callBackUrl ...  codepre  pThis works fine, and for example when I use my custom action in a forkjoin manner, the execution of the actions runs in parallel.p  pNow, the problem is, that Oozie remains in a RUNNING state for this actions. It seems impossible to change that to a completed state. The check method is never called by Oozie, the same is true for the end method. It doesnt help to set the context.setExternalStatus, context.setExecutionData and context.setEndData manually in the Callable after the client.run has finished. I tried also to queue manually an ActionEndXCommand, but without luck.p  pWhen I wait in the start method for the Callable to complete, the state gets updated correctly, but the execution in forkjoin isnt parallel anymore which seem logic, as the execution waits for the Callable to complete.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20671386howexternalclientsnotifyoozieworkflowwithhttpcallback2068030120680301How external clients notify Oozie workflow with HTTP callbacka didnt help, as using the callback seems to change nothing well, I can see that it happened in the log files, but beside from that, nothing.... Also, the answer mentioned, that the SSH action runs asynchronously, but I havent found out how this is done. There is some wrapping inside a Callable, but at the end, the call method of the Callable is invoked directly no submission to an Executor.p  pSo far I havent found any example howto write an asynchronous custom action. Can anybody please help mep  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrongp  pHere are the implementations of initActionType, start, check, end, the callable implementation can be found inside the start action.p  pThe callable is submitted to an executor in the start action, after which its shutdown method is invoked  so the executor shuts down after the Callable has finished.

Negative 43129 pMy app can stream audio files. Their size can exceed 100MB. Modern 4gLTE connections can downloadbuffer a file of this size in under a minute. The problem is that, if the user decides after 2 minutes not to finish listening to a fully buffered 60minute item, then a vast amount of data from the users cellular data plan gets wasted.p  pIt seems that the default behavior of AVPlayer  AVPlayerItem is to buffer the entire file.p  pI know how to continuously monitor the buffer using a timer and AVPlayerItems codeloadedTimeRangescode.

Negative 43129 pHi I am trying to make a Meteor web app that uses primarily modals to navigate from one page to another.

How can I add those features in Meteor I have been using Crater Modals, but let me know if your solutions requier use of other modals.p

After I did that and rebooted, the mouse or touchpad wouldnt work anymore NOTE The touchpad is working fine when I boot into mac osx but it does not work when I boot into ubuntu. Now I dont know if the direct cause for it not to work is me downloading wine or if its for any other reason, my question is p  pHow can I solve this problemp  pHow do I completely remove wine from my system with all of the files that come with it  If that even is the problemp  pIs there some kind of configuration file for the touchpad found in the ubuntu system  If so how do i access it and check it and alter it to work again or something. I just need any solution to this problem I really need the touchpad to work again.

Negative 43129 pIn NHibernate, there is a codewherecode mapping that allows you to specify a condition on a property mapping that affects how it is pulled from the database. For example, if I wanted to implement a soft delete and exclude all deleted items from a set, I could map it like sop  h3FluentNHibernateh3  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode in class ParentMap  ClassMap HasManyx gt x.Children.WhereIsDeleted  0 codepre  h3Hbm.Xmlh3  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltclass nameParent table[Parents]gt     ltbag cascadeall lazytrue nameChildren whereIsDeleted  0gt         lt rest of map here gt     ltbaggt ltclassgt codepre  pIs there anything similar in Entity Framework 6p  pThe closest thing I found was a library called stronga hrefhttpsgithub.comjbogardEntityFramework.Filters relnofollowEntityFramework.Filtersastrong, which allows you to add global filters for properties, but it doesnt seem to work when that property is a collection. p  hr  pTo give a better example of why a mapping like this is necessary, lets say I have a class that has a collection of objects that have a recursive child entity relationship i.e., a collection of objects of the same type. They follow this basic structurep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class ReportOutline      public long Id  get set      public string Title  get set      public string Author  get set          public virtual ICollectionltOutlineItemgt OutlineItems  get set    public class OutlineItem      public long Id  get set      public string Name  get set       public long ReportOutlineId  get set      public long ParentOutlineItemId  get set           public virtual ReportOutline ReportOutline  get set      public virtual OutlineItem ParentOutlineItem  get set           public virtual ICollectionltOutlineItemgt OutlineItems  get set   codepre  pAnd these are mapped with the EF fluent API like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodemodelBuilder.EntityltReportOutlinegt     .HasKeyo gt o.Id     .HasManyo gt o.OutlineItems     .WithRequiredi gt i.ReportOutline     .HasForeignKeyi gt i.OutlineId  modelBuilder.EntityltOutlineItemgt     .HasKeyp gt p.Id     .HasManyp gt p.OutlineItems     .WithOptionalc gt c.ParentOutlineItem     .HasForeignKeyc gt c.ParentOutlineItemId codepre  pThis produces the correct database structure, and my records look fine. Heres an example of what the codeOutlineItemscode table would look like with two items on a codeReportOutlinecode, if one had two child items four altogetherp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeId    Name           ReportOutlineId    ParentOutlineItemId 1     Introduction   1                  NULL 2     Pets           1                  NULL 3     Cats           1                  2 4     Dogs           1                  2 codepre  pWhen the codeReportOutlinecode gets loaded through the codeDbContextcode, however, since codeReportOutlineIdcode matched the outlines codeIdcode, the codeReportOutline.OutlineItemscode is getting populated with all four items. This results in the subitems appearing both under the parent items and the main outline itselfp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeTitle  My Report Author valverij  I.  Introduction  Id 1 II.

Dogs         Id 4 lt Duplicated codepre  pNow, if I were using NHibernate with FluentNhibernate, I could specify a codewherecode condition on the entity mapping, so that codeReportOutline.OutlineItemscode emonlyem pulls parent itemsp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode in ReportOutlineMap HasManyx gt x.OutlineItems.WhereParentOutlineItemId IS NULL codepre  pWithout that, I would have to remember to emonlyem access codeReportOutlinecode objects through a prewritten query that explicitly deals with the codeOutlineItemcode collection.p

Negative 43129 pI have implemented a UIScrollView with a UIView which I add when viewDidLoad to the UIScrollView which is set to the UIViewControllers view.

Negative 43129 pFor an ASP.NET SPA app, the code template that ships with VS2013 is very different from the code template that ships with VS2013 Updates 234. For reference, heres the same template fromp  pVS2013 a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsnc9t691adg2q9acOldTemplate.zipdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comsnc9t691adg2q9acOldTemplate.zipdl0ap  pVS2013 update 4 a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comssk8qajyxy4kx4m3NewTemplate.zipdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comssk8qajyxy4kx4m3NewTemplate.zipdl0ap  pThe biggest difference seems to be that logging in with the original template is done without a postback, entirely through JavaScript which seems to keep with the SPA spirit. But in the later version of the template, a full postback happens during login. There is a plethora of other changes that seem connected to this main change, for example, in the older version there exists this method inside ApplicationOAuthProvider.csp  precodepublic override async Task GrantResourceOwnerCredentialsOAuthGrantResourceOwnerCredentialsContext context              using UserManagerltIdentityUsergt userManager  userManagerFactory                      IdentityUser user  await userManager.FindAsynccontext.UserName, context.Password              if user  null                              context.SetErrorinvalidgrant, The user name or password is incorrect.                 return                           ClaimsIdentity oAuthIdentity  await userManager.CreateIdentityAsyncuser,                 context.Options.AuthenticationType             ClaimsIdentity cookiesIdentity  await userManager.CreateIdentityAsyncuser,                 CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType             AuthenticationProperties properties  CreatePropertiesuser.UserName             AuthenticationTicket ticket  new AuthenticationTicketoAuthIdentity, properties             context.Validatedticket             context.Request.Context.Authentication.SignIncookiesIdentity               codepre  pThis method is completely omitted from the newer template.p  pWould appreciate any insight as to why such significant changes were made. I dont see any advantages, and for a SPAstyle app I prefer the lack of postback. But perhaps there were important security or design reasons considered which I should also consider.p  pThanks... Benp

Negative 43129 pI have an ASP.NET MVC project that encompasses the bulk of a web application as well as a web API that is consumed by clientside code. The API component is beginning to sprawl and I would like to separate the API and MVC app into two projects. MyAppMVC and MyAppAPI. However I am unsure how to get the MVC app to play nicely with the API when they are not part of one project.p  pRight now I have an API controller codeMyAPIControllercode that answers POST and GET requests sent from clientside JavaScript to codeapiMyAPIcode. When both the JS and API live under the same project, I run the solution from Visual Studio and hit the API with no issues.p  pHowever, when they run in different projects, this no longer cooperates. To avoid violating crossdomain security, the JS must be hitting the API within the same domain  port. However Visual Studio runs my API and MVC application on different ports, and attempting to hit the API from the Javascript file living inside the MVC file causes sameorigin errors.p  pIs there any way to have these two different but complementary projects running on the same domain  port For organization and modularity I would really like to be able to separate my web application into multiple projects rather than lumping them into a single massive one.p

Negative 43129 pI hope the title is not too convoluted to understand...   Please have some patience while I explain as the restrictions of the platform I am working on make this convoluted.p  pI am working on a functionality feature on a commercial eCommerce platform, ie BigCommerce.  This causes many restrictions in terms of what and how things can be done.  p  h2What I am trying to accomplishh2  ul lipI need to bring strongcolor swatch connected to the appropriate product image color when user clicks a color in the colorswatchstrong functionality to a categories page of the site.   pli lipThis functionality already exists on the individual product pages, however there is no straight forward way to bring it to the categories page, hence this script.pli lipSo essentially, when a user is on a product page, they see a line of little colored boxes ie, red, green, blue, yellow, etc which when clicked, will bring up the appropriate product color image into the main image DOM element so if they click red, the red product appears in the main image DOM element, if they click green, the green product appears, and so onpli ul  h2The problem in implementing thish2  ol liThe rule sets of matching a certain color to a certain image are not available to developers for some terrible reasons.  They are not even available thru the API with any language ruby, python, PHP.  li liOn the product page, where the feature exists, the URLs are not present as they are automatically generated by backend PHP I think when a user clicks the boxes.  to be honest, I am not sure how the URLs to the images are generated but I cant find any reference to the URLs either directly or by dynamic rules.  Ive scoured through all the JS manually and through some searches and cant find any reference to this functionality.li liIve written a script to imitate a user click as this seems to be the only action that changes the image.  Ive also tried writing a script that reproduces the same behavior as clicking ie, change class of one box from selectedValue to nothing, and set the clicked box to selectedValue, but this does not change the DOM element.  The script I am using utilizes .click.   Can click be used with AJAX to imitate user behavior on an external page, generating dynamic content, and then to bring the result of that action to the current pageli ol  h2My questionh2  ul liIs it possible to achieve this by  ol liusing AJAX to visit each product page, li liimitate user clicks on each color box, li lirecord each URL of the image DOM element that is changed by the click, li lithen bring those URLs with their respective color values to the current page li liand utilize them in recreating the colorswatchclick behavior on that pageli olli ul  h3Is there some other way you can think of to accomplish thish3  pI am more than happy to share the JS I wrote, along with the relevant HTML from each of the two pages, but I do not think it will necessarily help to answer my question.p

Negative 43129 pLets say we have a class which has an instance method that accepts another instance of that class, and then returns a new instance of that class.p  pAn example of an this type of class is an integer. It has the codemulcode method, which accepts another integer and returns an integer, which is the product of both numbers.p  pHeres the problem. I have a class that implements a method like codemulcode. I have a list of instances of this class, and I want to apply the aforementioned method of the last object to the object before it, then take the result of that and apply it to the one before it, etc., until we have processed the entire list, and have ourselves one object.p  pA concrete example looks like this. Imagine we have a list of objects...p  precodemyobjs  [do, re, me, fa, so, la, te, do] codepre  p... And imagine they have the combine method, which follows the pattern outlined above, and we want to apply the procedure I outlined to it. You might think of it like this ...p  precodemyobjstogether  do.combinere.combineme.combinefa.combineso.combinela.combinete.combinedo codepre  pThats pretty gnarly, obviously.

Negative 43129 pHi I am a newbie to Meteor and I would like to know what is the use of hashedToken generated inside the Meteor.user object. p  pIn Meteor documentation it is explained that the services object,p  blockquote   pcontaining data used by particular login services. For example, its reset field contains tokens used by forgot password links, and its resume field contains tokens used to keep you logged in between sessions.p blockquote  pWhen I check the localstorage, Meteor.loginToken seems different from the hashedToken. p  pso my question is, 1.what is the difference between Meteor.loginToken generated in the local storage and hashedToken generated inside the service object  2.Also why do resume.loginTokens inside service object is an arrayp  pAny help is appreciated...p
Negative 43129 pSo a coworker and I were discussing making a data object for our e2e tests. From my understanding about data objects they are used for decoupling your test suites. For example, my first test suite is to create an account and to test if the fields are valid and the second test suite logins into the account and does its own tests. I am told it is good to use data objects not a page object just incase the first test suite fails when making an account. That way we can use the data object in the second test suite to create a new user just for testing login. My problem is that if my first test suite fails at making an account, why would creating an account in my second test suite pass Whatever error I get in the First test suite, I should also get in the second test suite right I have many more questions about data objects and how to use them. I was wondering if someone could explain data objects and how to usewrite one. p  precode         Test Data Object   var Member  function      var unixTime  StringMath.roundnew Date1000     this.username  TestAccount  unixTime     this.email  this.username  gmail.com     this.password  password   Member.prototype.create  function       var signup  new signupPage.Signup     signup.getPage     signup.memberAsthis.username, this.email, this.password   Member.prototype.login  function       var login  new loginPage.Login     login.getPage     login.memberAsthis.username, this.password   Member.prototype.logout  function        k.logoutMember   exports.Member  Member codepre  pThis is the data object my coworker wrote.

Negative 43129 pWe are rewriting a very large legacy Webforms .NET application. Ideally, I would like to have it completely as SPA, based on AngularJS, Bootstrap, and WebAPI. Obviously, the overall look and feel should be consistent across the application.p  pI have one big concern, however. There are many rich controls calendar, table not to mention light or shared controls like tooltips or tabs. These control libraries come with their JavaScript and CSS.p  pThe easiest way is to minimize and load all JS and CSS in index.html. But easiest isnt always the best. Even minimized, these libraries come up to a significant size, especially when over half of it is not needed. I realize that Web Components emwillem allow such dynamic loading but until then, should I go for more traditional MVC design, and go to the server for full page reload Or with the power of todays desktops and browsers I am exaggerating the problem and should just load all the libraries upfrontp

Negative 43129 pMy names Mario Garrido, a postdoctoral student in Biology. I am relatively new with R and despite I find it brilliant I am having some difficulties in finding some functions and interpreting the syntaxes.p  pAt the moment I am working on a GLZM model which fits a Poisson distribution using codelme4code package. After calculating Akaike weights of several best potential models, my best model is one including a 4way interaction term. It is the followingp  precodemodel7ltglmeractive treatment daytype time age1indiv,familypoissonlinklog,nAGQ1 codepre  pMy first intention is not to test between the different levels of different factors but to know which subset of 2 and 3way interaction terms have more influence on the model. Is there any function on the package codephiacode or in other package to perform a Post hoc test to know which subset of 2 and 3way interaction terms have more influence on the model p

Negative 43129 pI would like to set my MVC 5 application to not cache the page for my Login view i.e. I would like the Login view to actually reload if my user has pressed Back in the browser in order to navigate to the Login page.p  pThis is so that I can log the current user out before the user attempts to log in as somebody else.p  pI saw an example of somebody using this in Global.asax p  precodeprotected void ApplicationBeginRequest      Response.Cache.SetCacheabilityHttpCacheability.NoCache     Response.Cache.SetExpiresDateTime.Now.AddDays1     Response.Cache.SetNoStore     Response.Cache.SetProxyMaxAgenew TimeSpan0, 0, 0     Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpiresfalse     Response.Cache.SetRevalidationHttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches  codepre  pbut this stops caching for basically every page on every request.

Negative 43129 pIm using struct.unpack to read the 11th byte of a file to the 21st byte which represents a field that is supposed to read SNA. The field is populated as BCSA where it is left justified and padded to the right boundary with BCS spaces. Since the field is 10 bytes long, my format string is 10s. However, per the output mentioned, the remaining 7 bytes are spaces. To eliminate those spaces I use strip. Unfortunately, this still yields SNAx00. What am I doing wrong p  precodefield  struct.unpack10s,data[startstop] field[0].strip since the output of a strut.unpack is a tuple codepre
Negative 43129 pWhen i read colleagues code in my team, i usually found there were two different types of definition for const NSString objectsp  pcodestatic NSString const code   and codestatic NSString  constcodep  pAs far as i know, the former is a pointer point to a const codeNSStringcode object, and the latter defines a const pointer to a codeNSStringcode object.  p  pMy question is which is a better programming practice and a preferred way when defining a const codeNSStringcode object in codeobjectiveccode p  pThx.p
Negative 43129 pWell I am trying to create a constructor for my ASP.NET MVC 5 Controller, which is used to initialize properties such as Repository, Mapper and Services.  This is the code I write as below, for a group pagep  precode    public ApplicationDbContext Db  get private set      public GroupMapper Mapper  get private set      public ImageUploadService ImageUploader  get private set       public GroupsController              this.Db  new ApplicationDbContext         this.Mapper  new GroupMapperDb         this.ImageUploader  new ImageUploadServicethis.Server      codepre  pThe issue here is, the properties for parent controller aint initialized and therefore cannot be used in child constructor. In this case, the property is this.Server, but this value does not exist until the object is completed. If I use this.Server in a controller action, it is available. But if I use it in the constructor, it is not, and instead returns a null reference.p  pI have no idea why ASP.NET MVC behaves this way, I thought when I create a child controller all parent properties are already there, but I was wrong. This leads to an issue when I use the ImageUploader service, as the dependency this.Server is null and I get tons of errors.p  pSo does anyone know how to fix or get by this issue It really surprises me and I have no idea what I can do. p

Negative 43129 pI have a few questions about applications based on Google cloud endpoint  data store.p  pSpecifically, I know that we can write a JDO class, and in Eclipse, have the Google plugin to generate an endpoint class for CRUD operations, and since the CRUD operations deal directly with the data store, conceptually they seem to  belong to Data Access Layer.p  pMy questions arep  p1. Where do we put the business logic e.g. data validation, workflow logic specific to the application. If we put all that in the generated endpoint classes, will that be a mix of Data Access and Biz Logic, which will result in maintainability and reusability issues p  p2. For data store, are there any visual tools for designing the domain model, similar to traditional relation database technologies e.g. tools from Entity Framework from Microsoft, Data Model in IOS Are there tools for data importexport from other formats, e.g. CSVp  pIf the questions are not clear please let me know so that I can clarify a bit.p  pThank a lot John.p

Negative 43129 pSOLVED Had underscore in header field.  Should be contenttypetextplain NOT contenttypetextplainp  pIve been trying to make some VBA code work on Mac without success.

Negative 43129 pHi I have array with a number of nan values. I am looking for a way to estimate values for those nan values through plane defined by other finite data. The plane covering the full dimension more than 10001000 will be an exaggeration of data. So my idea is to loop through each nan value location with window of 2020 and find the plane defined by the data avialable in that window and estimate the value at the center of window.

Negative 43129 pI am converting a project that use to use nib files to a project where I am using Storyboards.  The app has a home screen HomeVC that is loaded into a navigation controller.  When the app launches it starts a data handler that pulls rss data from a number of sources and stores them in CoreData.  In the HomeVC I was instantiating the next view in the stack FeedVC so that I could call a reloadData method on it when the data handler finished downloading the feeds.  To instantiate FeedVC I wrote the following code when I set up the data handler in the HomeVC.p  precode This initializes the Feed VC for use later in the VC     FeedViewController view  [[FeedViewController alloc] initWithNibName FeedViewController bundle nil]     self.feedViewController  view codepre  pWhen the data handler finished I reloaded the table view with the following code.p  precode[self.feedViewController.feedsTableView reloadData] codepre  pThis worked well.  p  pThe new project is coded in Swift and as I mentioned is using Storyboards.

Negative 43129 pI have an application that uses an externally referenced library that is, the directory of the library is in the same level as the application  it is not copied inside the applications folder.

When I built the app, all referenced to the classes defined in the library are not found  I get cannot find symbol class ... errors on all imports of library classes. As I found, this is because when rebuilding the application, proguard obfuscates all classes and variables and therefore the application cannot reference them.

This appears to work  calling codeCountcode on the codeIEnumerableltLeadgtcode object returns the total records.p  pWhat Id like to know is where the enumeration operation takes place. Is it Dynamics side, or is it pulling all leads into my web server memory and counting there The whole reason Im performing the count in the first place is to guard against pulling too large a dataset into memory...p

Negative 43129 pI have a problem similar to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6714046clinuxdoubledestructionofstaticvariablelinkingsymbolsoverlapc linux double destruction of static variable. linking symbols overlapa only my issue is with two vendor supplied libraries, so I do not have access to the code. The vendor has two dynamic libraries and linking against either one works fine, but linking against both causes the double delete of at least one static variable when the program finishes running. The vendor primarily targets windows and as in the referenced question, they use the appropriate dllexport attributes on that platform I think they just missed it on linux and I dont expect it to be fixed. Is there something I can do when linking to their libraries to hide symbols then or is there some command I could run on their libraries to change the static variable namesp

Negative 43129 pOkay, Im stumped on this.

I have two versions of the page, one that asks for credit card info, and one that just creates a user. The one that just creates a user passes the message fine when I redirect. But the page that has two Ajax calls, one to create the user, and the other to process their payment, doesnt pass the message.p  pI tried disabling the redirect and then manually going to another page to see if the flash message is passed after the user was created and the payment was processed, but the message is not there I have a section in my master blade template that is already set up to display my flash messages.p  pI was having this same problem on the registration page without credit card info and the problem was that I was redirecting to a page that was blocked with a middleware and so my flash message was being killed. But this is not the case with the registration page with credit card info. It is just trying to redirect to the home page and the user is logged in, so it should work...

Negative 43129 pThis is not a blocking issue, but I would like to understand how Play handle controller injection better.p  pIn a hrefhttpswww.playframework.comdocumentation2.4.2ScalaRouting relnofollowPlay document about Routing in 2.4a, it is said thatp  blockquote   pPlay supports generating two types of routers, one is a dependency injected router, the other is a static router. The default is the static router, but if you created a new Play application using the Play seed Activator templates, your project will include the following configuration in build.sbt telling it to use the injected routerp      proutesGenerator  InjectedRoutesGeneratorp      pThe code samples in Plays documentation assumes that you are using the injected routes generator. If you are not using this, you can trivially adapt the code samples for the static routes generator, either by prefixing the controller invocation part of the route with an  symbol, or by declaring each of your controllers as an object rather than a class.p blockquote  pSo, to my understanding, with coderoutesGenerator  InjectedRoutesGeneratorcode in codebuild.sbtcode, if I use codecode prefix for controller invocations, it is the same as making a controller as a singleton codeobjectcode. This goes against the fact that I have been declaring my controllers as codeclasscode that has some injections using codeInjectcode, and I prefix all my controller invocations with codecode so that IntelliJ does not report error.p  pSo, what does the codecode really do my the controller invocationsp

Negative 43129 pI have an UPDATE query in a stored procedure, in which I need to update a table variable that has been already populated by some data.

Negative 43129 pI work at a university and weve received several requests to get Netflix and Amazon Instant video working on our kiosk, lab, and classroom computers.  We currently secure them with a combo of group policies, Forensit Profile Manager, and Faronics Deepfreeze.p  pI set up some locked preferences on Firefox with a custom config file.  Most of the changes work, but Ive noticed clearing passwords doesnt work until Firefox has been used once and shut down.  After that everything seems to work as intended.  IE keeps throwing random Netflix errors that dont seem applicable install media pack even though it should already be installed, enable protected media playback although it is already enabled etc.  We found that running IE 11 in developer mode as IE 10 worked, but it seems hard to get that change to stick.

Negative 43129 pI am trying to make my way through a lot of Azure documentation on multitenant identity management, for a bespoke ASP.NET MVC SaaS site. It is difficult as it seems that a lot of the online examples and articles are now outdated and not applicable to latest VS templates, and other vague aspects, such as determining what is Preview and what is not. Also, MS tend to use the word multitenant when specifically dealing with partner companies who have their own Azure AD, which is not our case.p  pOur proposed system will offer a web application to different customers. The backend will have a separate db per customer tenant. The front end will select which db connection and probably use impersonation depending on the logged in user. The identity management would preferably be offloaded to Azure ACS, so that in future if we want to integrate with corporations with their own Federation identity provider we can, but for those smaller companies that dont have their own domain, we want to create accounts on their behalf.p  pI am thinking that a good way to do this is by using Azure ACS for federating with corporate customers and a general Azure AD directory for everyone else, where in the second case I create a group per tenant customer. Then, in Azure ACS, I translate all claims, either the group from my own AD, or the company name from the federated identity provider, and use that in the MVC app to establish the tenant.p  pIs this an OK way to do it Am I overlooking some standard, simple way that Azure already offers Is this future proof wrt to the Azure roadmapp

It only returns cookies set by my site such as Language and User preferences. The cookie should be persistent cookie since I am still logged in after I close and reopen the browser. Any thoughtsp
