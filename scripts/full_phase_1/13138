Positive 13138 pThe title seems a little bit confusing, but Ill explain everything.p  pIm developing a project where I show the image captured by a webcam in a JPanel, Java Swing. Now I have to integrate this with JavaFx. I have a controller where I have the method startRecording, that would initialize the cameraThread and tell the class Camera to startRecording, inside Camera class a have a method DrawFrameBufferedImage, JPanel panel where I call the function drawImage from OpenCV to draw in the Panelp  pControllerp  precodepublic void startRecording     cameraInstance.setCameraRGBPanelwindowsInstance.getCameraRGBPanel     cameraInstance.setCameraHSVPanelwindowsInstance.getCameraHSVPanel     cameraInstance.setCameraThresholdPanelwindowsInstance.getCameraThresholdPanel     cameraInstance.setRecordtrue     cameraThread  new ThreadcameraInstance     cameraThread.start  codepre  pClass camerap  precodeprivate void drawFrameBufferedImage buff, JPanel pane     pane.getGraphics.drawImagebuff, 0, 0, null  codepre  pTo start with, JavaFX has no JPanel and the Pane an option has no getGraphics, Ive tried to use a SwingNode, add the JPanel and then do everything as usual, but the image simply wont be shown.p  pThe following code was a test, thats why it seems to be so bad.p  precodepublic void startStage stage throws Exception       stage.setTitleTela Teste      pCamera  new Pane     SwingNode swing  new SwingNode     pCamera.getChildren.addswing     createAndSetSeingContentswing      Group root  new Group     root.getChildren.addpCamera     stage.setScenenew Sceneroot , 500, 500     stage.setResizabletrue     stage.show   private void createAndSetSeingContentSwingNode swing                      ControllerCamera control  new ControllerCamera     System.loadLibraryCore.NATIVELIBRARYNAME      JPanel panel  new JPanel     JLabel label  new JLabelAbc     panel.addlabel     swing.setContentpanel      Button teste  new ButtonA     pCamera.getChildren.addteste     teste.setOnActionnew EventHandlerltActionEventgt           Override         public void handleActionEvent event              control.startRecordingpanel             System.out.printlnabc                codepre  pI changed to method startRecording to something likep  precodepublic void startRecordingJPanel panel     cameraInstance.setCameraRGBPanelpanel     cameraInstance.setRecordtrue     cameraThread  new ThreadcameraInstance     cameraThread.start  codepre  pStill nothing appears in the panel, but if I add a label or button, then it appear and works as intended to. The abc is always shown in the console.p  pI think thats all the code related to the problem. Something else I want to say is that yesterday was the first day I was dealing with FX, lets say the project is divided, the other guy is also working on the problem, but we havent gotten anywhere so far, thats why I decided to ask you here.p  pEdit 1 everything was working perfectly before all this situation everything works with Swing, but not in FX.p

Positive 13138 pIm working on an assignment for class where we need to create a JComboBox and each option opens a new window where you can do whatever you want on those new windows.  Please keep in mind Im very new to GUI and new to Java in general, in case my questions are dumb. p  pI have a question and an issue...p  pMy questionbr strongWhen the user selects The Matrix option a new window pops up with a quote and two buttons.  Right now I have two JPanels panel and panel2 panel adds the quote to the NORTH position and then panel2 adds the two buttons to the CENTER position both using BorderLayout.  My question is am I doing this correctly...Could I use just panel to add the quote and the buttons or is it necessary to create separate panels for separate items being added to the JFrame When I had them both added to the same panel the quote was not on the window when I ran the program.strongp  precode    panel.addmatrixQuote     newFrame.addpanel, BorderLayout.NORTH codepre  pThats how I had it when it wasnt showing up p  pstrongI GOT THE ISSUE WITH CLEARING THE JFRAME FIXEDstrongbr I am trying to add an ActionListener to the bluePill button and instead of opening another new window I thought I could clear everything from the existing window when the button is pressed and then display something new on said window.

Positive 13138 pI am notdoing a school project, so please do not be alarmed. I am doing some private programming to brush up. My program, a program of type .java, creates a form that asks for the boundaries and quantities of a lotterydrawing activity and acts on the generating based on the input.p  pHeres my problem. On the WIndows 2000 computer where I coded the program, shows itself, perfectly. Thats only half the story. When I tried to put it on another computer, the program shows a blank window it compiles and runs, but it shows a blank window. Now, I do consider version numbers to be factors, so I will provide the versions and ask for confirmation if those are the root of the evil.p  pOn my original computer, which is Windows 2000, the version is 1.6.031b05.

Positive 13138 pI have a problem with codeJPanelcode location. I started the creating a small game... I created 2 panels in design on a codeJFramecode. All worked good and the panels were on the correct places. In my game I have to use 2 graphic tables so I use 2 panels and I add every one of them panel set layout codenew Grid Layout10,10code. p  pAfter that I run the project to see how it works and I discover my panels in other places and with another size. I found the way that helps my to change back the size but I cannot found the way to change back the location or a way to give my own location...p  pI tried to add pictures that can show you what I see but the site blocked the pictures... p  pThe code isp  precodepublic class GameFrame extends javax.swing.JFrame  int [][]p1 int [][]p1Attac int [][]p2 int [][]p2Attac static int size10 int player JPanel [][]b1 JPanel [][]b2 int w1100,h900     Creates new form GameFrame   param player1   param player2   public GameFrameint [][]player1, int [][]player2      initComponents     setSizew, h     setVisibletrue     size10     p1new int[size][size]     p1Attacnew int[size][size]     p2new int[size][size]     p2Attacnew int[size][size]     b1new JPanel[size][size]     b2new JPanel[size][size]     initplayer1, player2     leftBoard.setBackgroundColor.red     rightBoard.setBackgroundColor.blue     GridLayout glnew GridLayoutsize, size     leftBoard.setLayoutgl     rightBoard.setLayoutgl     forint i0iltsizei         forint j0jltsizej             b1[i][j]new JPanel             b1[i][j].setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.black             b1[i][j].setBackgroundColor.red             b2[i][j]new JPanel             b2[i][j].setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.black             b2[i][j].setBackgroundColor.blue             leftBoard.addb1[i][j]             rightBoard.addb2[i][j]                   leftBoard.setPreferredSizenew Dimensionw250, h2     rightBoard.setPreferredSizenew Dimensionw250, h2     leftBoard.setIgnoreRepainttrue     leftBoard.setLocation0, h5  public void initint [][]player1,int [][]player2     forint i0iltsizei         forint j0jltsizej             p1[i][j]player1[i][j]             p2[i][j]player2[i][j]             p1Attac[i][j]0             p2Attac[i][j]0                   This method is called from within the constructor to initialize the form.

Positive 13138 pSo basically if I put codeJPanelcodes inside a codeJPanelcode that uses codeGridBagLayoutcode and I restrict the size with codesetPreferredSizecode, eventually it reaches a point where it cant hold all of them, and it exhibits the behavior shown in the attached picture p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comXhIvS.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXhIvS.png altenter image description hereap  pIm making an a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiAccordion28GUI29 relnofollowaccordiona. This is just an example to showcase the problem Im having. Each part of the accordion can open individually and theyre of arbitrary size and get added on the fly. Its easy enough to get the heights of all the individual panels and compare them against the total height, but when too many are added it exhibits the crunching behavior Ive shown. This also shrinks the heights so its much more difficult to determine when the crunching has happened. I would have to cache heights and somehow precalculate the heights of the new parts getting added. The end goal is to remove older panels when a new panel is added and there isnt enough room for it.p  pIs there an easy way to determine what height something would be if it werent constrained, or maybe a supported way to detect when such crunching has is happening so I can quickly thin it out before it gets painted again An option that makes codeGridBagLayoutcode behave like some other layouts and overflow into a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiHammerspace relnofollowhammerspacea instead of compressing would work too.p  pCode for examplep  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event. import javaisms.out import javax.swing.  public class FoldDrag extends JLayeredPane      public TexturedPanel backingPanel  new TexturedPanelnew GridBagLayout,dataguigrayerbricks.png     static JPanel windowbasenew JPanel     static JPanel restrictedpanelnew JPanelnew GridBagLayout      GridBagConstraints gbc  new GridBagConstraints      public FoldDrag          JButton addpan   new JButtonAdd things         windowbase.addaddpan         windowbase.addrestrictedpanel         restrictedpanel.setBackgroundColor.red         restrictedpanel.setPreferredSizenew Dimension200,200         gbc.weighty1         gbc.weightx1         gbc.gridx0         gbc.gridy0         gbc.gridheight1         gbc.gridwidth1         gbc.fillGridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL         addpan.addActionListenernew ActionListener              int number0             Override             public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                              number                 gbc.gridynumber                 JPanel tmppanel  new JPanel                 tmppanel.setPreferredSizenew Dimension100,30                 ifnumber30                     tmppanel.setBackgroundColor.blue                 ifnumber31                     tmppanel.setBackgroundColor.yellow                 ifnumber32                     tmppanel.setBackgroundColor.green                 restrictedpanel.addtmppanel,gbc                 restrictedpanel.validate                               windowbase.setVisibletrue          private static void createAndShowUI          JFrame frame  new JFrameDragLabelOnLayeredPane         frame.getContentPane.addwindowbase         FoldDrag thedragnew FoldDrag         windowbase.addthedrag         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         frame.setPreferredSizenew Dimension300,300         frame.pack         frame.setResizabletrue         frame.setLocationRelativeTonull         frame.setVisibletrue           public static void mainString[] args          out.activetrue         java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable              public void run                  createAndShowUI                             codepre  pstrongEDIT Seems I didnt describe my version of the accordion very well.

Ive tried to just refer to it generally byp  precodeString mass  txts[1].getText codepre  pHowever this doesnt recognise txts as existingp  pAny help on this would be much appreciated.p  pBelow is the full code in case it helps.p  precodeimport javax.swing. import javax.swing.border.EmptyBorder  import java.awt.event. import java.awt.  public class InitScreen       public static void createHomeScreen           Creates a Java Frame with the Window Name  HomeScreen         JFrame frame  new JFrameHomeScreen         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         frame.setSize400,400         frame.getContentPane.setPreferredSizenew Dimension400,300         frame.pack                     Creates the main JPanel in form of GridLayout         JPanel mainPanel  new JPanel         mainPanel.setLayoutnew BoxLayoutmainPanel, BoxLayout.YAXIS         mainPanel.setBordernew EmptyBordernew Insets20,20,20,20          Creates the first sub panel         JPanel firstPanel  new JPanel         firstPanel.setLayoutnew GridLayout1,2,75,100         firstPanel.setMaximumSizenew Dimension300,100          Creates the buttons in the first sub panel         JButton[] btns  new JButton[2]          String bText[]  Calculate, Clear         for int i0 ilt2 i              btns[i]  new JButtonbText[i]             btns[i].setPreferredSizenew Dimension100, 50             btns[i].setActionCommandbText[i]             btns[i].addActionListenernew ActionListener                 public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                      String choice  e.getActionCommand                     JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Clicked choice                     JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Force                                             firstPanel.addbtns[i]                    Creates the second sub panel         JPanel secondPanel  new JPanel         secondPanel.setLayoutnew BorderLayout          Creates the labels for the second sub panel         JLabel label  new JLabelCalculate the Force of an Object, SwingConstants.CENTER         secondPanel.addlabel,BorderLayout.NORTH          Creates the third sub Panel for entering values         JPanel thirdPanel  new JPanel         thirdPanel.setLayoutnew GridLayout3,1,10,10         thirdPanel.setMaximumSizenew Dimension400,100          Create labels and text fields for third sub panel         String lText[]  Mass of Body, Acceleration of Body, Force         JLabel[] lbls  new JLabel[3]         JTextField[] txts  new JTextField[3]         for int i0 ilt3 i              txts[i]  new JTextField             lbls[i]  new JLabellText[i], SwingConstants.LEFT             lbls[i].setPreferredSizenew Dimension50, 50             thirdPanel.addlbls[i]             thirdPanel.addtxts[i]                    mainPanel.addsecondPanel         mainPanel.addthirdPanel         mainPanel.addfirstPanel          frame.setContentPanemainPanel         frame.setVisibletrue             public static void mainfinal String[] args          javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable              public void run                  createHomeScreen                              codepre
Positive 13138 pas the title says, I would like to add a JLabel to a class in my case, named GamePanel which extends JPanel. I tried withp  precode    public class GamePanel extends JPanel implements Runnable, KeyListener       Some of my instructions          public void gamelabel                      JLabel mylabel  new JLabel              mylabel.setBounds0, 0, 1280, 720              GamePanel.addmylabel    Here Im getting an error message          Others instructions        codepre  pSo I really dont know how to do it, but I have the feeling it must be an easy solution... Nevertheless, I couldnt find it.p  pHow could I do it Thanks in advance.p
Positive 13138 pGood day,p  pI mightve been a bit vague with the title of my question, but I hope this will explain. The scenario is quite basic  I have a JFrame, in which I have an array of JPlanes. The idea is that when I click on one of them, upon clicking in should become black. Here is the codep  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter import java.awt.event.MouseEvent import java.awt.event.MouseListener  import javax.swing. import javax.swing.border.Border  public class PixelArt       JFrame frame     Border blackline     JPanel squares[][]  new JPanel[100][100]     int x     int y      public PixelArt           frame  new JFramePixel Art         frame.setSize1000, 1000         frame.setLayoutnew GridLayout100, 100         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE          for int i  0 i lt 100 i              for int j  0 j lt 100 j                  x  i                 y  j                 squares[i][j]  new JPanel                 squares[i][j].setBorderBorderFactory.createDashedBordernull                 squares[i][j].addMouseListenernew MouseAdapter                       public void mouseClickedMouseEvent e                           x  e.getX                         y  e.getY                         squares[x][y].setBackgroundColor.black                                                          frame.addsquares[i][j]                                frame.setVisibletrue           public static void mainString[] args          new PixelArt       codepre  pThe actual problem is that this code does not do what I explained above. It does color in one of the JPlanes black when clicked, but within a em9x9 area starting from the upper corner of the gridem. I do not have an explanation for this. The problem seems to be in the following 2 linesp  precode    x  e.getX     y  e.getY codepre  pOne of my guesses is that I have some kind of an offset in the coordinate system, but then this does not explain why regardless on which JPanel I press, the JPanels colored are only in the upper 9x9 area.p  pDoes anyone have a clue how I could fix the problem I described above If something is unclear in my explanation, please ask. Thank you in advance. p  pHere is a screenshot of the working codep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com3dKxM.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3dKxM.png altScreenshot of working codeap
Positive 13138 pI have a very strange and rare bug in my simple 2d game using Java Swing. The game is a sort of flappybird, the player can move up and down, that works fine. My collision didnt work so I printed out the player y coordinate. The problem is Every time after the player y was printedwhich was correct, Java printed the coordinate 357which is not correct. It says that the player coordinate was 357 but that wasnt because I could still move the player correctly.

I tried to follow my teachers instructions on how to make an application to work both as an applet and an application and now the panels show on the frame only in the applet mode.p  precodeimport

Positive 13138 pMy program generates random numbers from 0 to 12 but if the result is 12 it would set dash as the text of JLabel, instead of the number generated.p  pNow, I wanted to sort my codeJPanelcode in ascending order based on the codeJLabelcode contents. In case of similarities in numbers, the black codeJPanelscode are placed on the left. It works fine except when there are dashes included, in which it doesnt sort properly. I would like to insert the codeJPanelscode containing dashes anywhere but its not working as expected.p  pScreencaps from a shorter version of my programp  pPure numbersp  pa

Negative 13138 pI need to store database passwords in a config file. For obvious reasons, I want to encrypt them preferably with AES. Does anyone know a Delphi implementation that is easy to introduce into an existing project with  10,000 lines of historically grown URGH source codep  pClarification Easy means adding the unit to the project, adding max. 5 lines of code where the config file is read and be done with it. Should not take more than 15 minutes.p  pAnother clarification The password is needed in order to create a connection to the db, not to support a user management scheme for the application. So using hashes does not help. The db engine checks if the password is valid, not the app.p
Negative 13138 pWe use Guids for primary key, which you know is clustered by default.p  pWhen inserting a new row into a table it is inserted at a random page in the table because Guids are random. This has a measurable performance impact because the DB will split data pages all the time fragmentation. But the main reason I what a sequential Guid is because I want new rows to be inserted as the last row in the table... which will help when debugging.p  pI could make a clustered index on CreateDate, but our DB is auto generated and in development, we need to do something extra to facilitate this. Also CreateDate is not a good candidate for a clustered index.p  pBack in the day I used a hrefhttpwww.informit.comarticlesarticle.aspxp25862Jimmy Nielsons COMBsa, but I was wondering if there is something in the .NET framework for this. In SQL 2005 Microsoft introduced newsequentialid as an alternative to  newid, so I was hoping that they made a .NET equivalent, because we generate the ID in the code.p  pPS Please dont start discussing if this is right or wrong, because GUIDs should be unique etc.p

Negative 13138 pI am using and working on software which uses MySQL as a backend engine it can use others such as PostgreSQL or Oracle or SQLite, but this is the main application we are using. The software was design in such way that the binary data we want to access is kept as emBLOBsem in individual columns each table has one emBLOBem column, other columns have integersfloats to characterize the emBLOBem, and one string column with the emBLOBems MD5 hash. The tables have typically 2, 3 or 4 indexes, one of which is always the MD5 column, which is made codeUNIQUEcode. Some tables already have millions of entries, and they have entered the multigigabyte in size. We keep separate peryear MySQL databases in the same server so far. The hardware is quite reasonable I think for general applications a Dell PowerEdge 2Uform server.p  pMySQL codeSELECTcode queries are relatively fast. Theres little complaint there, since these are most of the time in batch mode. However, codeINSERTcode queries take a long time, which increases with table size number of rows. Admittedly, this is because the MD5 column is of type codeUNIQUEcode and so each codeINSERTcode has to figure out whether each new row has a corresponding, alreadyinserted, MD5 string. And its not too strange I think if the performance gets worse if there are other indexes not unique. But I still cant put my mind to rest that this software architecture choice I suspect keeping emBLOBsem in the table row instead of disk has a significant, negative impact is not the best choice. Insertions are not critical, but it is an annoying feeling to have.p  pDoes anyone have experience in similar situations With MySQL, or even other preferably Linuxbased RDBMes Any insights you would care to provide, maybe some performance figures p  pBTW, the working language is C which wraps C calls to MySQLs API.p

Negative 13138 pI wrote a reasonably basic memory allocator using sbrk. I ask for a chunk of memory, say 65k and carve it up as needed for variables requesting dynamic memory. I free the memory by adding it back to the 65k block. The 65k block is derived from a union sizeof16bytes. Then I align the block along an even 16byte boundary. But Im getting unusual behavior.p  pAccessing the memory appears fine as I allocate and begin to populate my data structures accept that on one of my function calls, I pass a pointer to a member variable in a global structure but the address of the pointer argument doesnt map directly to the address of that member.p  pFor example, the real address of this particular member happens to be 0x100313d50 but when executing a particular function nothing special the address of the member is being represented as 0x100313d70. Inside the debugger I can query the real address and it appears correct when inside the function where this manifests. This isnt the first member being accessed either, its the third so two prior memory accesses are fine, but during the third access Im seeing this unusual shifting.p  pIs it possible that Im accessing this memory via a misaligned block Its possible but Id expect the get a SIGBUS exception thrown SPARC chip. Im compiling using memalign16s so it ought to SIGBUS instead of trapping and fixing the misalignment.p  pAll of my structures are padded on a multiple of 16bytes sizeofstructure16  0. Has anyone had experience with this type of behavior Generally speaking, what type of thingsstuffetc. might cause a pointer to misrepresent a memory addressp  pCheers, Tracy.p  pSolaris 10, SunStudio12, C language on modern SPARC processor in case this helps.p

Negative 13138 pIve just recently completed a personal project and one technique I did use to break down the interface was to have one main Model View Controller that was handling a lot of the main logic of the application. Then for the most part, there were many generic controls lets say a Slider and a Text Field that were bound together to a single float value. They themselves would make up another Model View Controller that the parent Model View Controller would interact with. Though the communication would allays be down hill, never self reflecting loop.p  pSo in general, The controller would interact with the controller of the Slider and textField that were bound together. But both did not have access directly to each others view, so when a event did occur for the Controller of the Text field and slider it would be handled by the parent controller that would handle most of the logical flow of the program then down to the controller of the slider and text field.p  pThis worked great and got a lot of great responses of the users who used the application and loved the flex ability it did bring with very logical readjusting controls that they didnt have to think.p  pThough the developer in me questions the pragmatism and purity of the design. The design of the system was a top town approach that I took from this Adobe post castp  pAdobe, general algorithms a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv4moyKUHApq4 relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv4moyKUHApq4ap  p,and generally usage of using MVC as objects inside objects reflected this instead of one global MVC controller.p  pAnd suggestions where i could improve in the next project or should i use this same approach againp

Negative 13138 pIs there a way to escape the one big stack model of Win32 without crippling SEH Id like to be able to allocate stack frames on the heap, as a way to implement coroutines. However, my code is currently depending on SEH, and a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comcbrummearchive2003100151524.aspx relnofollowthis articlea, a few pages down, says relating to traversal of exception handlers, scanning, emphasis minep  blockquote   pThe OS is pretty paranoid about corrupt stacks during this chain traversal.  It checks that all chain entries are strongwithin the bounds of the stackstrong.  These bounds are also recorded in the TEB.  The OS also checks that all entries are in strongascending orderstrong on the stack.  If you violate these rules, the OS will strongconsider the stack to be corruptstrong and will be unable to process exceptions.  This is one of the reasons that a Win32 application cannot break its stack into multiple disjoint segments as an innovative technique for dealing with stack overflow.p blockquote  pSo basically, if an exception occurs while the current stack frame is outside the one big stack, the process will terminate instantly. Not ideal behavior.p  pHas anyone been able to work around this issue and utilitze SEH with a disjoint stack in a native Win32 app Also, are there any other Win32specific gotchas with disjoint stacksp

Negative 13138 pIf while an application is running one of the shared libraries it uses is written to or truncated, then the application will crash. Moving the file or removing it wholesale with rm will not cause a crash, because the OS Solaris in this case but I assume this is true on Linux and other nix as well is smart enough to not delete the inode associated with the file while any process has it open.p  pI have a shell script that performs installation of shared libraries. Sometimes, it may be used to reinstall versions of shared libraries that were already installed, without an uninstall first. Because applications may be using the already installed shared libraries, its important the the script is smart enough to rm the files or move them out of the way e.g. to a deleted folder that cron could empty at a time when we know no applications will be running before installing the new ones so that theyre not overwritten or truncated.p  pUnfortunately, recently an application crashed just after an install. Coincidence Its difficult to tell. The real solution here is to switch over to a more robust installation method than an old gigantic shell script, but itd be nice to have some extra protection until the switch is made. Is there any way to wrap a shell script to protect it from overwriting or truncating files and ideally failing loudly, but still allowing them to be moved or rmdp  pStandard UNIX file permissions wont do the trick because you cant distinguish movingremoving from overwritingtruncating. Aliases could work but Im not sure what entirety of commands need to be aliased. I imagine something like trussstrace except before each action it checks against a filter whether to actually do it. I dont need a perfect solution that would work even against an intentionally malicious script.p

Negative 13138 pI have an open source VSPackage that I would like to release with support for Visual Studio 2005, Visual Studio 2008, and Visual Studio 2010.  Im trying to figure out how to create the installer and how to perform the package registration with each edition of Visual Studio.p  pThe deployment research Ive done indicates my best bet for an installer is a VSIX inside an MSI.p  pThe registration research Ive done is a lot less clear.  VSPackage registration seems to differ for every edition VS2005 uses regpkg, VS2008 uses pkgdef, VS2010 uses VSIX.p  pCan anyone share their experiences andor point me towards any information about the best approach for targeting multiple versions of Visual Studio  Im looking for the easiest implementation and preferably keeping it in a single installer if reasonably feasible.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 13138 pIs there a way in Windows using C to record a sample of the stereo mixp  pIn other words, record all pings, beeps and music being played via any application Ive had a look at a hrefhttpnaudio.codeplex.com relnofollowNAudioa which will record the microphone as its source, but I cant figure out how to point it at Windows stereo mixp  pOr, if anyone knows, any pointers on how to target and record sound from a specific application For this Im only concerned with Vista or Windows 7, as both the aforementioned operating systems support mixing applications separately  so I wasnt sure if there was a way to tap into that.p  pIve looked at WINMM and COREDLL too, but Im a bit lost.p

Negative 13138 pI have to write a lot of code that deals with serial ports.

Negative 13138 pI have a Django web site which I want ot be viewable in different languages. Until this morning everything was working fine. Here is the deal. I go to my say About Us page and it is in English. Below it there is the change language button and when I press it everything magically translates to Bulgarian just the way I want it. On the other hand I have a JS menu from which the user is able to browse through the products. I click on TShirt then a submenu opens bellow the previously pressed containing different categories  Men, Women, Children. The link guides me to a page where the exact clothes I have requested are listed. BUT... When I try to change the language THEN, nothing happens. I go to the Abouts Page, change the language from there, return to the clothes catalog and the language is changed...p  pI will no paste some code.p  pThis is my change button codep  precodefunction changeLanguage      if getCookielanguage  EN          setCookielanguage, BG      else          setCookielanguage, EN          window.location.reload  codepre  pMy About Us pagep  precodebase def aboutUsrequest     return ltbgtsltbgt  getTranslationAbout Us Text, request.COOKIES[language] codepre  pThe base methodp  precodedef basemyfunc     def innerfuncargs, kwargs         try             args[0].COOKIES[language]          except             args[0].COOKIES[language]  BG           raise Exceptionrequest           if I am in the AboutUs page           and I click on the language change button          the cookie value in the request object changes          if however I am in the displayClothes page          the value stays the same           some code I removed          contents  myfuncargs, kwargs          return rendertoresponseindex.html, title title, categoriesByCollection categoriesByCollection.iteritems, keys enumeratekeys, values enumeratevalues, contents contents, btnHomegetTranslationHome Button, args[0].COOKIES[language], btnProductsgetTranslationProducts Button, args[0].COOKIES[language], btnOrdersgetTranslationOrders Button, args[0].COOKIES[language], btnAboutUsgetTranslationAbout Us Button, args[0].COOKIES[language], btnContactsgetTranslationContact Us Button, args[0].COOKIES[language], btnChangeLanguagegetTranslationButton Change Language, args[0].COOKIES[language]     return innerfunc codepre  pAnd the catalog pagep  precodebase def displayClothesrequest, category, collection, page     clothesToDisplay  getClothesFromCollectionAndCategoryrequest, category, collection      contents         some code I removed              return s  contents codepre  pLet me explain that you neednt be alarmed by the large quantities of code I have posted. You dont have to understand it or even look at all of it. Ive published it just in case because I really cant understand the origins of the bug.p  pNow this is how I have narrowed the problem. I am debuging with raise Exceptionrequest every time I want to know whats inside my request object. When I place this in my aboutUs method, the language cookie value changes every time I press the language button. But NOT when I am in the displayClothes method. There the language stays the same. Also I tried putting the exception line in the beginning of the base method. It turns out the situation there is exactly the same. When I am in my About Us page and click on the button, the language in my request object changes, but when I press the button while in the catalog page it remains unchanged.p  pThat is all I could find, and I have no idea as to how Django distinguishes my pages and in what way. p  pP.S. The JavaScript I think works perfectly, I have tested it in multiple ways.p  pThank you, I hope some of you will read this enormous post, and dont hesitate to ask for more code excerpts.p

Negative 13138 pThis question may sounds trivial, but i am struggling with the issue, so, please help if u can. So, here it is  i am using a codeCheckboxTreeViewercode for some good reasons.

Negative 13138 pIm not sure whether this is a server issue, or whether Im failing to understand how HTTP caching really works.p  pI have an ASP MVC application running on IIS7. Theres a lot of static content as part of the site including lots of CSS, Javascript and image files.p  pFor these files I want the browser to cache them for at least a day  our .css, .js, .gif and .png files rarely change.p  pMy web.config goes like thisp  precodeltsystem.webServergt     ltstaticContentgt         ltclientCache cacheControlModeUseMaxAge                       cacheControlMaxAge1.000000 gt     ltstaticContentgt ltsystem.webServergt codepre  pThe problem Im getting is that the browser tested Chrome, IE8 and FX doesnt seem to be caching the files as Id expect.

I dont care if the image gets out of date when the file on the server changes.p  pThere are a lot of these files even with spritemaps and the like and many of our clients have very slow networks. Each round trip to ping for that em304em status is taking about a 10th to a 5th of a second. Many also have IE6 which only has 2 HTTP connections at a time. The net result is that our application appears to be very slow for these clients with every page taking an extra couple of seconds to check that the static content hasnt changed.p  pWhat response header am I missing that would cause the browser to aggressively cache the filesp  pHow would I set this in a .Net web.config for IIS7p  pAm I misunderstanding how HTTP caching works in the first placep

Negative 13138 pSo heres the problem. Im writing an application that queries a webservice for some data. The returned data is an arbitrary number of strings.p  pI need to display a list of these strings, which obviously is most easily done by nesting a ListView in an other ListView. That is making a ListView whose rows contain other ListViews. The problem Ive run into is, that when I do this, the inner ListViews only display the first element in the backing array.p  pIm using a custom ListAdapter that extends BaseAdapter. Using the Eclipse debugger Ive been able to determine that the getViewint,View,viewGroupmethod for each instance one for each row in the nesting ListView gets always called three times, but always with the same intargument that is 0. The number of times the getView for a ListAdapter gets called seems to have little to do with the number of elements the backing array contains.p  pIve created a fairly simple test application that illustrates what Im actually doing.p  pThis is my ListAdapter.

Negative 13138 pI understand exactly why unused variable warnings occur. I dont want to suppress them in general, because they are incredibly useful in most cases. However, consider the following contrived code.p  precodeNSError error  nil BOOL saved  [moc saveamperror] NSAssert1saved, Dude1 , error codepre  pXcode reports that codesavedcode is an unused variable, when of course it isnt. I suspect this is because codeNSAssert1code is a macro. The codeNSBLOCKASSERTIONScode macro is emnotem defined, so Objective C assertions are definitely enabled.p  pWhile it doesnt hurt anything, I find it untidy and annoying, and I want to suppress it, but Im not sure how to do so. Assigning the variable to itself gets rid of the compiler warning, but Id rather do it the right way if such a thing exists.p

Negative 13138 pIm writing an ORM and am unsure of the expected behaviour of the Repository, or more precisely, the frontier between the Repository and the Unit Of Work. From my understanding, a Repository might look like thisp  precodeinterface IPersonRepository      public function findCriteria criteria     public function addPerson person     public function deletePerson person  codepre  pAccording to Fowler emPoEAAem, page 322p  blockquote   pA Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an inmemory domain object collection. [...] Objects can be added to and removed from the Repository, as they can from a simple collection of objects.p blockquote  pThis would imply that the following test should work assuming that we already have a Person persisted, whose last name is Fowlerp  precodecollection  repository.findlastnameEqualsFowlerCriteria person  collection[0]  assertEqualsperson.lastname, Fowler  person.lastname  Evans newCollection  repository.findlastnameEqualsFowlerCriteria  assertFalsenewCollection.containsperson codepre  pThat means that when mapping to a database, even if no explicit save method has been called somewhere, the Person model must have been automatically persisted by the Repository, so that the next query returned the correct collection, strongnotstrong containing the original Person.p  pBut, isnt that the role of the Unit Of Work, to decide which model to persist to the database, and whenp  pIn the above implementation, the Repository has to decide to persist the Person previously retrieved when receiving another find call, so that the result is consistent with the modification. But if no other find call were issued, the model would not have been persisted implicitly at all.p  pIn the context of a Unit Of Work, it is not really a problem, because we can start a transaction at the beginning, and rollback any insert to the db anyway if needed. But when used alone, cant this Repository lead to unexpected, unpredictable behaviourp

Negative 13138 pAny anecdotal comments or suggestions are welcome. p  pWe have applications that consume 3rd party vendor data through views.

Is there a better solution to this problem Perhaps keeping each supported release of the views in its own schema and having the views pull from the global schema where the tables are defined and where the data is p
Negative 13138 pConfused. Writing a VB app that uses a webservice. The URL for this webservice will change based on where the app is running from so I need to change it at runtime.

Negative 13138 pI have a Single Page Application in which the browser does all the logic work.  Except for initial loading, the server is pretty much a fancy interface to the database.p  pThe browser sends data dictionary keys, column name  value pairs, and where clauses for SELECT, for example.  The server assembles the parts into SQL, executes the queries, and replies.  NEW In a SELECT, for example, the table name and columns pulled are from the data dictionary  the browser supplies the data dictionary key and the SELECT where clause.p  pThis very open environment is very susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.  The goal is to emprevent damageem from said attacks.p  h2Problems to be Overcomeh2  pFirst, as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7291630sqlinjectionhowtosanitizeprogramgeneratedsqlclausediscusseda, it is impossible to paramaterize a random SELECT codewhere clausecode  SELECT cannot use a prepared statements.p  pSecond, codemysqlicode, the library for paramaterized statements with MySQL, does not support NULL nor MySQL functions, eg, CURRENTDATE or NOW, as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7330744usingmysqlitopreventsqlinjectionhowtosetnullorcurrentdatediscusseda.p  h2Proposed Solutionh2  pFirst, if SELECT cannot be paramterized, then execute SELECT by a user who has no DML or DDL rights.  This will prevent SQL Injection Attacks from changing the database.p  pSecond, write a wrapper function for codemysqlicode that will allow NULL and MySQL functions to be passed as parameters.  This will allow parameters to be easily used for all DML.p  pThird, shadow highly sensitive data where it cannot be seen or touched by normal queries or normal users.  This will put sensitive data, such as passwords, out of the range of attacks.p  pForth, write a wrapper order to enforce the user  query type relationship.  This will ensure SELECT are executed by the codeselectcode user, for examplep  pThe result of that effort is a hrefhttpsgithub.combangkokmacoMySQLsqlinjectionprevention relnofollowherea.  The question is, logically, will this approach successfully protect against SQL Injection Attacksp  h2NonAnswer Answersh2  pI proposed this same question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7401852resqlinjectionattackusingmysqlwhatarebaselinerequirementsbeforea.

Still understandable for me I guess. p  pThe problem is that this data contains russian, spanish, czech and all sort of international characters representable in UTF8.p  pIm not even sure, what encoding the char represents, probably win1250, because the strings returned are just bad. The function returns strongstrong instead of strongstrong. The first string is the UTF8 but represented in ASCII.p  pThe bigger picture Im playing with this C library which has already been written by someone else  the library exposes just two functions, open file returns pointer and get string from this file by string key returns string. This library is being used in a C project.p  pAt first, I thought that there might be something wrong with passing UTF8 strings between an C app and DLL libraryp  precode    [DllImportMoReader.dll, CallingConvention  CallingConvention.Cdecl]     public static extern IntPtr OpenFilestring path      [DllImportMoReader.dll, CallingConvention  CallingConvention.Cdecl]     public static extern string FindStringIntPtr filePointer, string key codepre  pC code p  precode    extern C declspecdllexport BinaryFileType OpenFilechar filePath     extern C declspecdllexport char FindStringBinaryFileType locText, char key codepre  pFindString returns the string but in a wrong encoding. And I dont know, how one could read ASCII represented in C strings which are Unicode as UTF8...I tried some conversion methods but to no avail.p  pThough I think the problem is in the C code, id love the char type to be in the UTF8 encoding, Ive noticed theres something called ema codepageem and there are some conversion functions and utf8 stream readers but because of my weak C knowledge, I dont really know the solution.p  pstrong UPDATE strongp  pIve found a property in the Encoding class... When I read the output string like thisp  precodeEncoding.UTF8.GetStringEncoding.Default.GetBytese codepre  p...the result is right. Im just getting the bytes from the string via some Default encoding and then I read the bytes again with the UTF8. The Default encoding here on my computer is ISO88592 but it would be just plain stupid to rely on this property.p  pSo...the question remains. I still need to know, how to read the void type with a particular encoding. But at least, I know now that the string is being returned in the default encoding used by Windows.p  p  ANSWER  p  pThanks everyone for answers.p  pAs James pointed out, char  are just numbers. So I avoided all encoding troubles by just getting the numbers and not trying to interpret them as a string at all. There was another problem...how to get an array of bytes in C out of a char in the C library There is a Marshal.Copy method but I need to know the size of the string. Every char in C must end with a null character 0. So in the end, I just read a byte after a byte until i find this null character. The code then looks like this.p  precodeIntPtr charPointer  ExternDll.FindStringfileIntPtr, someString Listltbytegt bytes  new Listltbytegt for int i0 i      byte b  Marshal.ReadBytecharPointer, i     if b  0         break       bytes.Addb   string theResultStringInTheUTF8  Encoding.UTF8.ToStringbytes.ToArray codepre

Negative 13138 pSome background, have a web app built on JSF2Primefaces 2.2.1, hosted on JBoss 5.p  pWe recently delivered this web app to our client for them to test in their own QA environment.  This has been going well for a while but recently they discovered a strange issue that we are not able to reproduce inhouse.p  pThe app is fully functional, but if at emanyem point the user minimizes the browser window and recovers the window by clicking on the Task bar, then the browser hangs and consistently consumes around 20 CPU until it is killed through Task Manager.  There are no script errors.p  pWhat is further strange about this is that this ONLY happens with Internet Explorer, it is not reproducible with Firefox or Chrome.  This web app contains NO thirdparty plugin components, no Flash, no Java applets, no video or audio players, nothing.p  pWe ruled out a single workstation issue as this is reproducible within every workstation in their organization.  My initial reaction is that they must have an IE plugin conflict of some kind, perhaps some local client software that is causing this, but they are not convinced.p  pThey were never very keen on JSF and are convinced that it must be a server issue.  Upon inspection of the server logs we uncovered no logged exceptions, however we did find several messages like thisp  blockquote   p20111205 132441,162 FINE  [javax.faces.component] ajpXXXXXXX2Fxx.xxx.xxx.xxx80091 No renderertype for component javaxfaceslocationHEADp      p20111205 132441,163 FINE  [javax.faces.component] ajpXXXXXXX2Fxx.xxx.xxx.xxx80091 No renderertype for component jidt15 p blockquote  pI have been searching for similar messages and havent really found anything.  If they do not minimize the app works perfectly fine so perhaps these log messages are a red herringp  pPlease give me any suggestions you may have, even if you are not sure.  At this point even if I cant figure it out I at least need to take some kind of action.  Thank youp

Negative 13138 pSearch is the most used feature on our website and the search query is the most CPU intensive, complex and frequent query that executes on our db, causing heavy CPU usages on the db server. To reduce the load on the db we have been looking at various caching strategies. For now, we intend to use the ASP.NET Cache. p  pThe idea is to have an inmemory db of the most frequentlyrecently createdaccessed objects in the cache and then query the inmemory db using linq to come up with search results. My initial thought was to Cache a List of the Users and then query or modify this List using linq. But given the complexities of multiple threads accessing or trying to modify List I was looking at other options. p  pWhich is when I thought that instead of Caching a List, cache the individual User objects with its Id as the key and try and query the Cache. At a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.caching.cache.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.caching.cache.aspxa I see that the Cache has an extension method AsQueryable but I am not sure what does this mean. Cache is a key value pair so with AsQueryable will I able to query the keys and get a set of User Objects or will I able to query the User objects and get my desired resultp

Negative 13138 pSo, im working on a progress bar for a CSV processing script.  codedncscrubber.phpcode goes through the CSV and checks a phone number against a database, returning matched and unmatched data in separate files.  codelines.phpcode returns the total amount of lines to be processed while codeprogress.phpcode returns how many lines have been worked through.

Negative 13138 pI am using the C VS2010 TableAdapter Wizard for my project to interface with my db.  I have generated my own Insert, Update and Delete commands for this adapter since it uses a join and can not generate its own.  Im okay with that, but unfortunately when I created the Insert command I am not able to call the Insert method on the tableadapter.  The other methods are working fine.  p  pFor example,p  pthis.joinTableAdapter  new MyTableAdapterp  pthis.joinTableAdapter.Insert lt does not exist.p  pIt was my understanding that once you create a valid insert command that this method should become visible on the table adapter.  Am I mistaken about this  It is working for my update and delete command.  Any ideas what I am doing wrongp  pAny help is appreciated.  Thanks everyonep
Negative 13138 pI have a function codeeventIterablecode in six different classes, each with different names. These classes are being stored in an codeObject[]code.p  pI have a custom codeArrayListcode class I had to create my own  long story, dont bother suggesting I use the standard one, and within it, you can access indexes from the codeArrayListcode.p  pEach of these class objects are stored at an index in the array list. However, since the type of the array is codeObjectcode, I cant call the functions. I cant change from codeObjectcode to a specific class because each of the classes is unique. They all share the codeeventIterablecode function, however.p  pThe goal is to be able to iterate through all of the classes in the codeArrayListcode, and run the codeeventIterablecode function within each class.p

Negative 13138 pIm using the Resources plugin in Grails 2.0.1.

Negative 13138 pI have a product.xhtml and a ProductBean. I use productid to access the products so I have a viewParam in product.xhtml with valueProductBean.id. The problem is that inside the bean I use an init function with a PostConstruct annotation in order to fill the details of the product. To do this I need the id to call an external function. I guess though that init is called before viewParam sets the id of the bean and therefore inside init I cannot call the external function because id is not set yet. What am I doing wrong and how do I fix thisp  blockquote   pUPDATEp blockquote  pI found what was wrong. I think the viewParam method works with CDI beans but the ManagedProperty method works with JSF beans..p  pI do have one other problem now. My CDI bean is RequestScoped and when the product.xhtml is rendered the bean is created and I guess is later discarded. The funny thing is that I have a function inside that bean which when I call, I can read the id which I assume this happens because is connected to the view param but not any other properties.

Negative 13138 pI have a working Java app that can find the most recently created file in a folder. My end goal is to have that app on a web page so when a user opens the web page the page will cause the most recent file in a folder to open. Ive read some tutorials from oracle on creating simple applets, but everything Ive come across involves making a GUI that my page will not need.p  pCurrently, when I open the html page in firefox it loads all the html except for the applet. It gives no error messages, it just doesnt do anything. I think its because it isnt recognizing my java app as an applet, so I think I may need to do more to convert my code to an applet. I added extends Applet to my java class name, and I looked into adding an init method, but that seems more geared towards those who want GUIs.p  pThe java app is below in case that may help.

Negative 13138 pAmong the four timing functions, codegetrusagecode, codeclockgettimecode, codeclockcode, and codegettimeofdaycode I want to understand clearly how they are implemented and what are their return values in order to know in which situation I have to use them.p  pFirst we need to classify functions returning strongwallclock valuesstrong compare to functions returning strongprocess or threads valuesstrong. codegettimeofdaycode returns wallclock value, codeclockgettimecode returns wallclock value strongorstrong process or threads values depending on the codeClockcode parameter passed to it. codegetrusagecode and codeclockcode return process values.p  pThen the second question regards the implementation of these functions and as a consequence, their accuracy. Which hardware or software mechanism does these functions use. p  pIt seems that codegetrusagecode uses only the kernel tick usually 1ms long and as a consequence cant be more accurate than the ms. Is it right  Then the codegetimeofdaycode function seems to use the most accurate underlying hardware available. As a consequence its accuracy is usually the microsecond cant be more because of the API on recent hardware.  What about codeclockcode, the man page speak about approximation, what does it mean  What about codeclockgettimecode, the API is in nanosecond, does it means that its able to be so accurate if underlying hardware allows it What about monotonicityp  pAre there any other functionsp

Negative 13138 pI have the following scenario 1. I creat a strongJFramestrong jFrame in a FrontEnd.java class implementing strongActionListenerstrong. Then I add a strongCanvas3Dstrong object to its strongContentPanestrong, and right afterwards, I add a strongJMenuBarstrong with a few strongJMenusstrong and a couple strongJMenuItemsstrong each. 2. Then I have a strongRendererClass.javastrong class that I use to render spheres into the Canvas3D object. So from strongFrontEndstrong, clicking on one of the JMenuItems, I handle the event and from the strongactionPerformedstrongActionEvent ae method I call RendererClassjFrame and I get the jFrame object from the Renderers side, and so the Canvas3D to paint spheres in it. So, I paint them in their initial positions. 3. Then, I update spheres coordinates in a strongloop sitting in FrontEndstrong, which calls updateCoordinates which is in the RendererClass. This is a heavy loop that may last for up to a minute. While updating spheres coordinates, I show how are they being updated in the Canvas3D in each iteration, coordinates vary only slightly  this is done by the updateCoordinates in the RendererClass.p  pThe problem is, while in the loop, which was called from the actionPerformed... method, I cant interact with the jFrame, not event close it.

If there is any other information you need, please let me knowp  hr  pBelow is the full test question text, along with the table completely filled in with the solutionsp  pConsider the following function for computing the product of an array of n integers.p  pWe have unrolled the loop by a factor of 3.p  precodeint prodint a[], int n   int i, x, y, z int r  1  fori  0 i lt n2 i  3      x  a[i] y  a[i1] z  a[i2]     r  r  x  y  z  Product computation  for  i lt n i     r  a[i]  return r  codepre  pFor the line labeled Product computation, we can use parentheses to create five different associations of the computation, as followsp  precoder  r  x  y  z  A1 r  r  x  y  z  A2 r  r  x  y  z  A3 r  r  x  y  z  A4 r  r  x  y  z  A5 codepre  pWe express the performance of the function in terms of the number of cycles per element CPE. As described in the book, this measure assumes the run time, measured in clock cycles, for an array of length n is a function of the form Cn  K, where C is the CPE.p  pWe measured the five versions of the function on an Intel Pentium III. Recall that the integer multiplication operation on this machine has a latency of 4 cycles and an issue time of 1 cycle.p  pThe following table shows some values of the CPE, and other values missing. The measured CPE values are those that were actually observed. Theoretical CPE means that performance that would be achieved if the only limiting factor were the latency and issue time of the integer multiplier.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKaRTU.png altenter image description herep  pFill in the missing entries. For the missing values of the measured CPE, you can use the values from other versions that would have the same computational behavior. For the values of the theoretical CPE, you can determine the number of cycles that would be required for an iteration considering only the latency and issue time of the multiplier, and then divide by 3.p

Negative 13138 pI am looking for a way to embed Windows Forms applications written in C in a C windows application. The native application main window is subdivided into several panes. The C app is supposed to appear within one of those panes, i.e. the root window of the C component the outermost form must be a child window of the main application.p  pCan this be done If so, howp  pSome additional context To my knowledge, there are two ways to go about this. First, host the CLR in the native app by using the .net hosting APIs ICLRRuntimeHost, etc.. Second, host the CLR by putting the windows form in an ActiveX control.p  pRegarding the first approach, I have managed to get the CLR started up and to load a C assembly thanks largely to a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles416471CLRHostingCustomizingtheCLRMattias Hgstrma. Where I am hitting a road block is that I see no way how to tell the component I am running in the CLR that it needs to be a child of a window passed in from the C side.p  pI have also experimented with the second method using ActiveX and thanks to a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles42965HowtoIntegrateCWindowinCProjectDaniel Yanovskya. It almost, but only almost, works for my purposes. I can let arbitrary Windows Forms components run in a child pane of the native app. BUT they always run on the main thread of the main app. This means they use the windows message loop of the main app. MSDN says this will not work reliably since the standard Windows message loops dont meet the requirements of Windows Forms I wanted to post the link to MSDN here but have already used up my newusertwolinkallotment.p  pThe exceptions to the message loop issue are, according to MSDN, Internet Explorer and MFC apps. The native app I am using as a host is definitely not Internet Explorer. Also, it uses the windows API as wrapped by wxWidgets so MFC is not or at least not a welcome option.p  pThe solutions Microsoft proposes involve letting the C components run in their own message loops on their own threads. This, at least as far as I can tell, necessarily leads back to the first approach mentioned above. So I am back to the question of getting a Windows Form to work under a passedin parent window.p  pAgain, I am interested in any input that clarifies the child window issue, independent of the approaches I have mentioned here. But in light of the context I could reduce the general question to two specific questions and I would need an answer to only one of themp  ul liGiven a Windows Form hosted in an ActiveX control, how can I allow the form to run in its own message loop on its own threadli ul  porp  ul liGiven a Windows Form running in a CLR hosted by a native app, how can I make the form be a child window of a window in the native appli ul
Negative 13138 pI have a problem which I do not know how to proceed further in Java TCP socket issue. So far as what we can get from the Internet, its not hard to get quite a number of working solution for TCP server amp client communication in Java. However, most of the example will have their server listen to a port, and then loop until they get a client which connects to the the server, then the code will perform server.accept and move further. For examplep  precode public static void mainString[] args throws IOException      ServerSocket s  new ServerSocketPORT     System.out.printlnStarted   s     try         Blocks until a connection occurs       Socket socket  s.accept       try          System.out.printlnConnection accepted  socket codepre  pIt will work perfectly if theres a client connecting to the server. And, my problem is that I need to continue some other procedures even though theres no client connecting to the server. In fact, I will need to launch another JFrame to continue the procedures even if there is no client connecting to the same port and ip. However, I have been struggling but as long as there is not client connecting to the server, my Java program will hang there with white popped up JFrame. p  pI would need to know how to overcome this as I am not quite sure whether theres a mistake in my understanding.

There is now multiple steps between these two shaders a patch constant function the hull shader and then the domain shader. p  pIf anyone can give me some insight into how to pass data through each of these sections , and if possible maybe some quick pseudo code to demonstrate it, Id be very thankful.

Negative 13138 pHi Ive been looking all over and cant seem to find an answer to my issue. I have very little experience with programming, especially ObjectiveC.br In my app there is a codeplistcode with a certain number of strings.

Say if there were 20 strings in the plist, and the app generated the number 5, then the app is supposed to read the 5th string in the plist.p  pIs there a way to do such a thing or is there another, more efficient way to accomplish this ANY help is GREATLY appreciated.

Negative 13138 pI started using Django release 1.5 and got a problem with my old codep  precodelta href url auto.views.viewpost post.slug gtlth3gtpost.titlelth3gtltagt codepre  pError  url requires a nonempty first argument. The syntax changed in Django 1.5, see the docs. Docs p  blockquote   pOne deprecated feature worth noting is the shift to newstyle url   tag. Prior to Django 1.3, syntax like  url myview  was interpreted   incorrectly Django considered myview to be a literal name of a   view, not a template variable named myview. Django 1.3 and above   introduced the  load url from future  syntax to bring in the   corrected behavior where myview was seen as a variable.p      pThe upshot of this is that if you are not using  load url from   future  in your templates, youll need to change tags like  url   myview  to  url myview .

Negative 13138 pI have a table view that is embedded inside a regular view controller which is embedded inside a navigation controller.p  pGenerally speaking, calling methods such as codetableViewnumberOfRowsInSectioncode, codetableViewtitleForHeaderInSectioncode and codetableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathcode work fine, they are seen and function properly....p  pNow comes the problem of displaying sections.  For some strange reason the method codenumberOfSectionsInTableviewcode is emnotem being seen when the program runs.  Ive tested this by inserting codeNSLogcodes as well as inserting breakpoints.  Nothing is being recognized inside this method.  When calling to display sections Im organizing it all through codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode it only displays the first section when it currently should display 5 because codenumberOfSectionsInTableviewcode is not required and defaults to 1.p  pIm thinking this is happening because of my tableView being embedded inside a view controller rather than it actually being a tableview controller.  But if thats the case, why do I not need to do anything special for the other codetableViewcode methods  As best I can tell, the sectionInfo part of the code inside the NSFetchedResultsController is set up properly since the other codesectioncode methods are working properly put codeNSLogcode inside each one to ensure the method is called.p  pAny help you can give at understanding andor correcting this issue would be greatly appreciated  Let me know if you need any more info on my code.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere is all the code Im using as it relates to this fieldp  precode NSFetchedResultsController fetchedResultsController  if fetchedResultsController  nil       NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]      NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameActiveList inManagedObjectContextself.managedObjectContext]     [fetchRequest setEntityentity]      NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptor1  [NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKeycategory ascendingYES]     NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptor2  [NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKeyname ascendingYES]     [fetchRequest setSortDescriptors[NSArray arrayWithObjectssortDescriptor1, sortDescriptor2, nil]]      [fetchRequest setSortDescriptors[ sortDescriptor1, sortDescriptor2 ]]       Only retrieves items where isActive SQLite field is 1 or YES     NSPredicate predicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatisActive  , [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES]]     [fetchRequest setPredicatepredicate]      [fetchRequest setFetchBatchSize20]      fetchedResultsController  [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc]                               initWithFetchRequestfetchRequest                               managedObjectContextself.managedObjectContext                               sectionNameKeyPathcategory                               cacheNameActiveLists]       fetchedResultsController.delegate  self  return fetchedResultsController    voidperformFetch   NSError error if [self.fetchedResultsController performFetchamperror]      FATALCOREDATAERRORerror     return     voidviewDidLoad  [super viewDidLoad]   [self performFetch]     NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableviewUITableView tableView  return [[self.fetchedResultsController sections] count]    NSString tableViewUITableView tableView titleForHeaderInSectionNSIntegersection  id ltNSFetchedResultsSectionInfogt sectionInfo  [[self.fetchedResultsController sections] objectAtIndexsection] return [sectionInfo name]  codepre

integration platform trying to sync created date and changed date on revisions. I am now focussing my efforts on directly querying the TFSdefaultcollection DB and getting the dates. Here is the sql.. select  from WorkItemswere where id   order by rev This will give all the revisions for a given ID. We can write a post migration script to loop thru all work items and update the created date [The CreatedDate column in WorkItemsWere will give that] and the revised date and changed date columns will have all the dates u need. However, the challenge is updating the changed dates [I am updating the Created date via the TFS API. Starightforward. Just run console app as a service account TFS user, open the work item, modify the created date and save it].  I am querying the source systems WorkItemsWere table, getting the Changed and Revision dates by each Rev and updating the target systems WorkItemsWere [Its important that the source and target systems are locked so no updats are happening during this script]. After the script ran, I picked a workitem on a taregt system and checked its history. All the history disappeared.. So, bad idea directly updating the changedrevision dates in DB. However, I found a workaround. If you just update the revision date and NOT the changed date, it does show the history. [without the Rev ]. This is an ok workaround for us. Will keep everyone posted.p

Negative 13138 pWhat are the best ways to create a multiprocessing GUI coding systemp  pI would like to create a place for the internet community to come and find examples on how to use  the codemultiprocessingcode module in python.  p  pI have seen several small examples of codemultiprocessingcode processes on the internet of simple global functions which are called in a main module, but I have found that this rarely translates easily into anything that anyone actually does with regard to GUIs. I would think that many programs would have the functions which they want to use in a separate process as methods of objects which may be aggregates of other objects etc. and perhaps a single GUI element would have an associated object that needs to call this process, etc. p  pFor example, I have a relatively complex program and I am having problems in getting a responsive GUI for it, which I believed to be due to my lack of understanding in codemultiprocessingcode and threading with codeQThreadcode. However, I do know that the example given below will at least pass information between processes in the manner I desire due to being able to execute codeprintcode statements but my GUI is still locking.

I get some suggestions from Intellisense, including the ToInt32 method I am looking for. But as long as I confirm this suggestion with Tab or Space, I get the followingp  precodeConvert.ToInt32[0] codepre  pSo, the text from the cursor position to the end of the word is substituted with suggestion, and this is definitely not what I want.p  pThis problem is not specific for VS 2012 and might be due to some extensions I have installed, but my attempt to pursue its origin did not yield anything. I have following extensions installed ReSharper, PowerCommands, Productivity Power Tools.p

Negative 13138 pSo I have a project that I think is simple enough to learn with, but complex enough to be interesting that I would like to write using the Happstack library.  At its most fundamental level, this project would just be a fancy file server with some domainspecific REST methods or whatever, I dont really care if its truly RESTful or not for searching and getting said files and metadata.  Since Im also trying to really learn monad transformers right now, I decided this would be the perfect project to learn with.  However, Im running into some difficulties getting it started, particularly with how to construct my transformer stack.p  pRight now, Im only worried about a few things config, error reporting, and state, and logging, so I started withp  precodenewtype MyApp a  MyApp      runMyApp  ReaderT Config ErrorT String StateT AppState IO a  deriving ... codepre  pSince Im always going to be in IO, I can really easily use hslogger with this to take care of my logging.  But I also knew I needed to use codeServerPartTcode in order to interact with Happstack, thusp  precoderunMyApp  ReaderT Config ErrorT String StateT AppState ServerPartT IO a codepre  pI can get this to run, see requests, etc, but the problem Ive run into is that this needs codeFilterMonadcode implemented for it in order to use methods like codedircode, codepathcode, and codeokcode, but I have no idea how to implement it for this type.  I just need it to pass the filters down to the underlying monad.  Can someone give me some pointers on how to get this obviously crucial type class implemented  Or, if Im just doing something terribly wrong, just steer me in the right direction.  Ive only been looking at Happstack for a few days, and transformers are still quite new to me.  I think I understand them enough to be dangerous, but I dont know enough about them that I could implement one on my own.

Negative 13138 pI have investigated options to deploy my web project to production server after git push.

Negative 13138 pI have a partial view in an MVC 4 project, which is strongly typed. It takes an IEnumerable collection of a table of a database. In that table there are IDs, Names, and ParentIDs for storing hierarchical connection between records. The view that calls the partial view is also strongly typed, it takes the whole database as the model, and passes the Categories table to the partial view, as an enumerable collectionp  precodeHtml.PartialTreeCategories, Model.Categories.ToList codepre  pAnd in the partial view, I want to take the root nodes first, so I can extend the whole tree in a recursive way. In the database table, all records are considered as root nodes with a ParentID  null.br  So generally, my way to do this would look likep  precodemodel IEnumerableltTreeCollections.OpenAccess.Categorygt  if Model.ToList.Count gt 0          if Model.ToList[0].Parentid  null              lttextgtltul idnavigationgtlttextgt           foreach var node in Model              ltligtlta hrefnode.Idgtnode.Nameltagt             foreach var subNode in Model.Wheres gt s.Parentid  node.Id                              Html.PartialTreeCategories, subNode                      ltligt          if Model.ToList[0].Parentid  null              ltulgt       codepre  pSo I check if the first elements ParentID of the Model is null, and if it is, then it should create a lt ul tag with the id navigation, so the jquery plugin can recognise that it is meant to be a treeview control. Then it creates a list tag with a recursive call within. The recursively called partial view takes the children of the node as the model. And lastly if we arrived to the end of the partial views rendering, and we are at the root level, it should write a closing lt ul tagbr  There are some problems, however. First, at the end, that closing unordered list tag is wrong, VS cant find the matching start tag for that. Second, I dont know why, but at the top, I can put the starter lt ul tag in between  tags, and I cant do it at the closing tag below. But Im not sure about these lt ul  tags either, I feel those are wrong too. br br  Please, help me, Im stuck with this for days now.p

So far, the only 2 Ive found are a hrefhttppecl.php.netpackagerrd relnofollowphp5rrda, and a hrefhttpgraphite.wikidot.comcarbon relnofollowCarbonGraphitea.p  pThe PHP5RRD solution seems simple enough, though Im worried Ill be needlessly reinventing the wheel.  Can anyone recommend other similar software packages that can help generate a bunch of live charts or graphs with a web frontendp

Negative 13138 pI have set up my scene to contain an edge loop and a ball shaped object which is supposed to drop down and then bounce around until all its energy is gone. However I cant seem to get the physics in SpriteKit to minimize restitution. The ball always drops and bounces back up only a few pixels.p  pMy parameters arep  ul liworld gravity  4fli libody of the ball  circular with radius half the width of the frameli lirestitution  0fli lifriction  0fli ul  pI tweaked already gravity, mass of the ball and all other properties. My last idea is to apply a force to the ball as soon as it hits one of the borders but that just feels wrong. I should be able to simulate a bouncing ball.p

Negative 13138 pFor example, Im trying to combine String1 String2 and String3 to read as String1  String2  String3.

I dont know if its a simple syntax error, or if this isnt even the correct way to go about making the date.p

Ive tried deleting the app from the sim, cleaning the build folder, resetting the simulator, restarting both...all the standard stuff. Still happens.p  pThis is a project I had been working on in iOS6Xcode 4. When I first opened it in XCode 5, I was prompted to update the storyboard. I hit yes because it seemed like a good idea.

Negative 13138 pI am teaching myself IOS development and I am running into an issue with one of the excercises I am trying to do.  Basically I have a list of pictures I want to display, so I created a Table View with a list of these pictures, and the goal is to click on a cell and show the picture autozooms to the size of the screen.  I have ARC turned off so I can learn to manage memory myself.p  pWhen I select a cell in the table view it invokes a UIViewController that has a scroll view and an image view.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu34VL.png altstoryboard snapshotp  pThis is how I connected the outletsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comURavu.png altHow the outlets are connectedp  pIn the PhotoViewControllers implementation under the method viewWillAppear, I wrote this codep  precode void viewWillAppearBOOLanimated  [super viewWillAppearanimated]  [self.scrollView setZoomScale1 animatedNO] CGSize boundsSize  self.scrollView.bounds.size NSLogAMRO scrollboundsSize  is width f and height f, boundsSize.width,  boundsSize.height    codepre  pI need the boundsSize to help me figure out how to zoom my picture.  The problem is that it always reads zero.  I know based on the the storyboard, the boundsSize is 320x455.  Obviously I do not want to hard code it.p  pIn my .h of that PhotoViewController, I definedp  precodeproperty strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UIImageView imageView property strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UIScrollView scrollView codepre  pNow if in ViewWillAppear, I do thisp  precodeCGRect fullScreenRect[[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame] self.scrollView[[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFramefullScreenRect] codepre  pThen I get bounds to be defined, but the size is off, its  width 320.000000 and height 548.000000.  I understand that the height of 548 is probably because it includes the Title Bar and the Tab Bar at the bottom.  Is there a way for me correctly set the bounds based on the viewing are of 320 by 455 as seen in the story board. I looked at other code snippets of folks doing the same thing and they do not even allocate the scrollView, is that because ARC is ON and that is something that is managed automaticallyp  pIf I use this approach, then I do get the correct size, but is this the right approach, I have seen examples where scrollview was never initialized and yet they have the bounds set correctlyp  precodeCGRect viewBounds  self.view.bounds self.scrollView[[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrameviewBounds] codepre

Negative 13138 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUwnST.gif altenter image description herep  pTo summarize, I have a recursive task and I want to use all 4 of my processors to process this really big tree faster. My current production implementation uses codeParallel.ForEachcode and is out of control, pegging all 4 of my cpus and running out of memory quickly. So, I know the right algorithm can give me all 4 cpus at 7080, which I have found will get the crawling job done quickly whilst leaving the UI responsive and my computer overall responsive for light UI userdriven tasks. This task is a background task.p  pThe method I am attempting listed below is parallel and recursive, and I want to use conditional locks to limit the threads. p  pI want this code to use a max of 4 threads to keep recursively creating 20 scary heads until a nesting depth of 10 is reached in all branches. I changed it from 2 to 20 heads because thats more like my actual problem. My actual tree is only 45 levels deep but quite wide, and each node requires alot more cpu than codeConsole.WriteLinecode.p  pThis has not as easy to accomplish as I envisioned it would be.p  pIm trying to make all threads greater than 4 wait until enough of the threads that came before finish to bring the total threads back down to 4 before they continue. So its ok if a few more than 4 threads get created, as long as the ones  4 are just waiting. Hence the conditional waiting locking part.p  pMy code example is just for concept purposes obviously and is just what I tried. Feel free to diverge from my implementation details.p  pEdit I changed my implementation last night to use SemaphoreSlim, a cousin of fat boy slim, to handle the traffic cop role. It only results in 2 processors busy at 20.p  pMy next iteration will probably involve looping four times to create 4 workers that crawl nodes independently of one another. But the difficulty with that is, theyll need to know which nodes subtree are currently being crawled or have already been crawled by another worker. Im not sure if thats less complicated than the approach below. It does seem the listed approach avoids processing nodes in the wrong order e.g. child before parent, but maybe thats just an illusion given off by the appearance of the structure of the code.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Threading using System.Threading.Tasks      public class ScaryTeddy              public ScaryTeddyScaryTeddy parent, int position                      Parent  parent             Position  position             DoSomethingHeavy                   public BlockingCollectionltScaryTeddygt Heads  new BlockingCollectionltScaryTeddygt         public ScaryTeddy Parent  get set          private string path         public string Path                      get                              if path  null                                      if Parent  null                         path  string.Format0.1, Parent.Path, Position                     else                         path  Position.ToString                                  return path                                public int Position  get set            short in duration but taxing on cpu and memory         private static void DoSomethingHeavy                       look at all the text inside every jpg in my pictures.

Negative 13138 pI have a database of articles that contains about 4,000 broken links in roughly 8,000 articles. About half of these broken links follow a pattern that, with the right PHP script, can be used to automatically fix those broken links.p  pThe broken links in question contain links like this p  precodelta hrefhttpwww.mydomain.tldarticle1234plusaslug thatvariesinlength.htmlgtsome textltagt codepre  pThe 1234 part represents the unique ID of the article.

Negative 13138 pOK so I am using SDL 1.2, and have created a planetary simulation of 2 bodies using it, I am near the end however, and there is one problem I cant seem to solve. in my program SDL reads the coordinates from a text file right, and then uses that text file to display the bodies on the screen afterwards. So my program can end one of two ways. What can happen is that either  a The two bodies collide, if this happens, the text file will read the coordinates 8888 8888 8888 8888 x1, y1, x2, y2  b One of the two bodies leaves the screen, if this happens, the text file will read the coordinates 9999 9999 9999 9999  x1, y1, x2, y2.  Anyways, so what I want the program to do is when it sees those coordinates, close SDL, and paste the picture on the screen that contains the error message. What I have tried so far is p  precode while x11[x11.size  1]  9999      Start the frame timer     fps.start      If the user has Xed out the window     ifevent.type  SDLQUIT              Quit the program         quit  true           Move the dots     myDot.move     MoDot.move2      Fill the screen white     SDLFillRect screen, ampscreengtcliprect, SDLMapRGB screengtformat, 0xFF, 0xFF,    0xFF       c      Show the dots on the screen     myDot.show     MoDot.show2      Update the screen     ifSDLFlipscreen  1              return 1           Capping the frame rate     iffps.getticks lt 1000  FRAMESPERSECOND              SDLDelay1000  FRAMESPERSECOND  fps.getticks       codepre  pAs you can see, in that while loop, as long as x11 which is coordinate x1 is not 9999, the while loop will continue to run, however what happens is that the program closes immediately So in other words, the program closes within like a second, and you dont get to see the simulation, however, if i change that line to      while quit  false the simulation shows, and when it gets to the point of the 8888 or 9999 coordinate it just crashes.  So my question is  How do i make the simulation stop when the coordinate being shown on the screen is 88889999 cuz if i do what i did before, the program stops immediatleyp

Negative 13138 pWe recently moved a number of static websites from multiple regional domains onto a single .com domain which uses Joomla to serve up content. The new site uses subdirectories and allows uses to navigate between countries. Like thisp  ul linewdomain.comcountryname1li linewdomain.comcountryname2li linewdomain.comcountryname3li ul  pWe would now like each site to go back to having its own domain, but to essentially serve up the same website the user would be seeing by viewing the sub directory well probably drop the ability to navigate between countries, back thats largely irrelevant to this post. p  pHow can we do this with as little work as possible to the templates whilst retaining a single Joomla instance Has anyone got any experience of similar Ive read some articles but am not sure any of them give the user a true sense of being on a separate domain.

If the updated resources bundle is available, the code will download and unpack it, replacing old files, so that the user will see the most resent content.p  pQuestions I have  is such approach a goodbad idea In other words, are their specific disadvantages to doing update in such manner or is it a commoin practice  how can I implement something like that Service Is there an existing sample piece of code that I could reusep  pThanksp

Negative 13138 pIm trying to run a SELECT statement on PostgreSQL database and save its result into a file.p  pThe code runs on my environment but fails once I run it on a lightweight server.p  pI monitored it and saw that the reason it fails after several seconds is due to a lack of memory the machine has only 512MB RAM. I didnt expect this to be a problem, as all I want to do is to save the whole result set as a JSON file on disk.p  pI was planning to use codefetchrowarraycode or codefetchrowarrayrefcode functions hoping to fetch and process only one row at a time.p  pUnfortunately I discovered theres no difference when it comes to the true fetch operations between the two above and codefetchallarrayrefcode when you use codeDBDPgcode. My script fails at the codesthgtexecutecode call, even before it has a chance to do call any codefetch...code function.p  pThis suggests to me that the implementation of codeexecutecode in codeDBDPgcode actually fetches ALL the rows into memory, leaving only the actual format its returned to the codefetch...code functions.p  pA quick look at the a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgpodDBIRowsInCache relnofollowDBI documentationa gives a hintp  blockquote   pIf the driver supports a local row cache for SELECT statements, then this attribute holds the number of unfetched rows in the cache. If the driver doesnt, then it returns undef. Note that some drivers prefetch rows on execute, whereas others wait till the first fetch.p blockquote  pSo in theory I would just need to set the a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgpodDBIRowCacheSize relnofollowcodeRowCacheSizecode parametera. Ive tried but this feature a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgpodreleaseTURNSTEPDBDPg3.0.0Pg.pmRowCacheSize relnofollowdoesnt seem to be implemented by codeDBDPgcodea p  blockquote   pNot used by DBDPgp blockquote  pI find this limitation a huge general problem codeexecutecode call prefetches emallem rows and more inclined to believe that Im missing something here, than that this is actually a true limitation of interacting with PostgreSQL databases using Perl.p  hr  pUpdate 20140309 My script works now thanks to using a workaround as described in my comment to Borodins answer. The maintainer of codeDBDPgcode library got back to me on the issue actually saying the root cause is deeper and lies within codelibpqcode postgresql internal library  used by codeDBDPgcode. Also, I think very similar issue to the one described here affects pgAdmin. Being postgresql native tool it still doesnt give in the codeOptionscode chance to define the default limit of the result set row size. This is probably why it makes codeQuery toolcode sometimes waiting a good while before presenting results from bulky queries, potentially breaking the app in some cases too.p
Negative 13138 pI write a cmdlet for Exchange 2010 management. So I need to debug it on Exchange 2010 server.  I have an Exchange 2010 started on virtual machine the one I have VS2012 on. p  pMy debug is planned like this. As postbuild operation I set followingp  precodecmd.exe c copy TargetPath testexch20101ctemp y codepre  pAs run command I set following p  precodeStart external command CWindowsSystem32WindowsPowerShellv1.0powershell.exe Command line arguments NoExit Command ImportModule CTempExchMgmt.dll codepre  pWhen I run the project the Powershell with proper command runs on the target server. But when I run the cmdlet no breakpoint is hit at all.p  pIf I build project in same way but then run Powershell on the target server manually, import module and then attach VS2012 to the powershell.exe process all breakpoints are successfully hit. Though sometimes same issue happens. p  pThe Exch2010 server is in domain, the VS2012 computer isnt. I use the only account in domain to connect, which is adminstrator of everything  Additionally Ive given explicit permission to this user to debug programs in SecPol.p  pAdditionally I tried to debug this project is VS2010. There Im getting a message The following module was built either with optimizations enabled or without debug information.  I doublechecked the project settingsbr    Optimize code is disabledbr    Debug info is fullbr    PDB file is generatedp  pI digged through the similar topics and found out that disabling of Just My Code setting helps. I tried this but it didnt help in my casep  pIve noticed the warning that System.Data.dll has different platform target I use x64. That  could be a reason. Since I didnt use this assembly I removed it from the list of references. After that Ive noticed no changes when I run the project. But when I attach debugger to the running powershell.exe process on remote computer with loaded my module I see Debug log stating followingp  precodepowershell.exe CLR v2.0.50727 DefaultDomain Loaded CtempExchMgmt.dll. Cannot find or open the PDB file. codepre  pHowever I ensure I copy both DLL and PDB files to the remote computer.

When I opened Symbol Load Information window Ive found following entry p  precodedProjectsExchMgmtExchMgmtobjx64DebugExchMgmt.pdb PDB does not match image. codepre  pIve checked the powershell.exe process is x64. But I also noticed it states the CLR is 2.0.50727. Not sure if its correct because the target framework for my module is 3.5p

Negative 13138 pIn our application, we have a Money type, which contains an amount decimal and a currency code string.

Negative 13138 pWe are deploying app to WildFly 8.0.0.Final. The app used to run on Jboss EAP 6.0AS7.1 fine with Seam3 managing JTA transaction.p  pHowever, since Seam3 does not work with WildFly, we are replacing it with DeltaSpike. We deployed the core and jpa module. However, it does not seem it works with mysql XA datasource well, even we tried hard to follow the instruction on their website and added apachedeltaspike.properties file to enable JTA support. When there are more than one datasource is involved, we see transaction errors. By turning on trace level logging for org.jboss.jca, we see warnings such as cannot list another datasource form current one and the jdbc driver failed.p  pThe other problem we saw is that the Transactional requires a presence of EntityManager. But sometimes, we have to look up an entitymanager at runtime instead of injecting one. In this case, we would get NullPointerException.

Negative 13138 pAs the title already says I try to draw a line which is defined by 2 mouse events. The start point of the line should be onClick so when the left mouse button gets clicked and the end point of the line should be onRelease. My basic idea was that I will call two events One for when the left mouse button is clicked and the second for when the left mouse button is released. This should simulate the dragging of the mouse. I save the coordinates for each event and after the 2 events happened I want to draw a line between the saved coordinates. Thats a least my basic idea...

Negative 13138 pbEDIT2b The issue was with how my Perl client was interpreting the output from PHPs codejsonencodecode which outputs Unicode code points by default. Putting the codeJSONcode Perl module in ascii mode codemy j  JSONgtnewgtasciicode made things work as expected.p  hr  pIm interacting with an API written in PHP that returns JSON, using a client written in Perl which then submits a modified version of the JSON back to the same API. The API pulls values from a PostgreSQL database whose encoding is UTF8.

Negative 13138 pThe EntityFramework seems very slow when populating a filtered child EntityCollection on an Entity  p  pWere running a RIAWCF Web App using database first Entity Framework written in C with a Silverlight client. We have a collection of about 70,000 Eval entities and a similar number of InCo entities. Each Eval has a child collection of InCo entities containing at most 2. The relationship is one to many so an Eval can have multiple InCos but an InCo is tied to a single Eval. After loading the entity collections from the database Im looping through the Evals like so p  precode    foreachEval eval in Evals         if eval.InCos.Count gt 0              Do something codepre  pThis is taking a long time minutes. Stepping through the code I found theres a generated function strongFilterInCosstrong on the Eval entity to determine whether an InCo has an association with it in the generated .Web.g.cs file and this is passed to the constructor of the Evals InCos EntityCollection and invoked to populate that collection when one of its properties is referenced for the first timep  precode    private bool FilterInCosInCo entity              return entity.EvalID  this.EvalID      codepre  pFrom what I can see the FilterInCos function is called for each InCo in the InCos collection for each Eval  thats 70,000 calls for each of the 70,000 Evals resulting in around 5 billion iterations to loop through the Evals and query the InCos collection on each one. As the EvalInCo database relationship is 1 it should be possible to loop through the InCo objects, retrieve the Eval with a matching EvalID and add the InCo to that Evals InCos collection  70,000 iterations. However there doesnt seem to be a way to circumvent the generated logic as I see it. Neither can we just assign an EntityCollection to the InCos property of the Eval as it is read only. p  pHeres the relevant database relationship from the EF edmx file p  precode    ltAssociation NameFKInCoEvalgt       ltEnd RoleEval TypeAspireEntityModel.Store.Eval Multiplicity1gt         ltOnDelete ActionCascade gt       ltEndgt       ltEnd RoleInCo TypeAspireEntityModel.Store.InCo Multiplicity gt       ltReferentialConstraintgt         ltPrincipal RoleEvalgt           ltPropertyRef NameEvalID gt         ltPrincipalgt         ltDependent RoleInCogt           ltPropertyRef NameEvalID gt         ltDependentgt       ltReferentialConstraintgt     ltAssociationgt codepre  pHeres the InCos property on the Eval clientside entity from the generated .Web.g.cs with the generated constructorp  precode     ltsummarygt      Gets the collection of associated ltsee crefInCogt entity instances.      ltsummarygt     [AssociationEvalInCo, EvalID, EvalID]     [XmlIgnore]     public EntityCollectionltInCogt InCos              get                      if this.InCos  null                              this.InCos  new EntityCollectionltInCogtthis, InCos, this.FilterInCos, this.AttachInCos, this.DetachInCos                          return this.InCos               codepre  pHas anyone found similar behaviour on a databasefirst EF application and can suggest a workaroundp

Negative 13138 pI have two scripts running in python on the same machine as endless loops, they are monitoring some values constantly.

So while B is writing and A wants to read then B will halt for short time and then continue. p  pThere is no need to sync the two. Actually I want them to be independant, not threaded or run in parallel.  For example B can go to cycles while A only goes one or vice versa. Or if A is delayed for some reason the messages would just pile up in file.txt since B continues running.p  pI have read about putting lock on the file.

Negative 13138 pa question from a newbie to c and apologies for the lenght of it.  I have the following scenario.  I have a small console application that populates a datatable by connecting to an external system and then needs to update existing records and insert new ones into an oracle table.  The columns in the datatable are not named the same as the oracle table columns and not in the same order.  I read another post on here with a similar scenario loading from a file into a table and it mentioned that doing an updateinsert with an OracleDataAdapter would work.  A simplified datatable and oracle table arep  pcodeDataTable table  new DataTable table.Columns.AddProduct, typeofString table.Columns.AddPrice, typeofdouble table.Columns.AddEffectiveDate, typeofDateTimecodep  pcodesample data table.Rows.Addabcd, 1.011, DateTime.Today table.Rows.Addefg, 1.00, DateTime.Today table.Rows.Addhijk, 20, DateTime.Todaycodep  pThe oracle table has the structurep  pcodeITEM VARCHAR220 BYTE NOT NULL ENABLE,  EFFDATE DATE,  VALUE NUMBERcodep  pI have tried the following code to use the datatable and an adapter to update the oracle table but Im missing something.  Im also wondering if Im barking up the wrong tree.  The majority of examples I have seen of using a dataadapter first does a select from the table and then puts the results into a grid where a user would be able to add, update, insert, or delete records and then uses the dataadapter to update the table.  In my case Im wondering if I get it to work if all records in the datatable will be treated as an insert anyway as there is no connection between the datatable and the oracle table.p  pIm using the Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client to connect and do the updatesp  precodepublic static void UpdateOrSaveItemsDataTable dt      String insertstatement, updatestatement, selectstatement      selectstatement  SELECT  from items     insertstatement  INSERT INTO items item, effdate, value values pInsItem,pInsEffDate,pInsValue     updatestatement  UPDATE items set effdate  pUpdEffDate, value  pUpdValue where item  pUpdItem      using OracleConnection conn  theDatabase.ConnectToDatabase              using OracleDataAdapter oraAdapter  new OracleDataAdapterselectstatement, conn                       build updateinsert commands and parameters          oraAdapter.UpdateCommand  new OracleCommandupdatestatement, conn          oraAdapter.InsertCommand  new OracleCommandinsertstatement, conn           oraAdapter.UpdateCommand.BindByName  true          oraAdapter.InsertCommand.BindByName  true           OracleParameter pUpdItem  new OracleParameterpUpdItem, OracleDbType.Varchar2          pUpdItem.SourceColumn  dt.Columns[0].ColumnName                             OracleParameter pUpdEffDate  new OracleParameterpUpdEffDate, OracleDbType.Date          pUpdEffDate.SourceColumn  dt.Columns[2].ColumnName           OracleParameter pUpdValue  new OracleParameterpUpdValue, OracleDbType.Double          pUpdValue.SourceColumn  dt.Columns[1].ColumnName           OracleParameter pInsItem  new OracleParameterpInsItem, OracleDbType.Varchar2          pUpdItem.SourceColumn  dt.Columns[0].ColumnName           OracleParameter pInsEffDate  new OracleParameterpInsEffDate, OracleDbType.Date          pInsEffDate.SourceColumn  dt.Columns[2].ColumnName           OracleParameter pInsValue  new OracleParameterpInsValue, OracleDbType.Double          pInsValue.SourceColumn  dt.Columns[1].ColumnName              oraAdapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.AddpUpdItem           oraAdapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.AddpUpdEffDate          oraAdapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.AddpUpdValue           oraAdapter.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddpInsItem          oraAdapter.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddpInsEffDate          oraAdapter.InsertCommand.Parameters.AddpInsValue           oraAdapter.Updatedt         codepre  pWhen I run this I get an error that I cannot insert a null into column that is defined as a key.

I wanted to avoid  p  pcodeloop through datatable select to see if record is in oracle table if in table update else insertcodep  pbecause the volume of records could a couple of hundred thousand and wasnt sure what the performance would be like.p

When I run mvn dependencytree it lists dependencies and their dependencies as expected but it fails to list any dependencies for X.jar. p  pX.jar is a custom jar from a project I wrote I have indeed added X.jar to the local repo so perhaps the problem lies there.

Negative 13138 pI work on some tests for several games. Most of the games have identical tests, only some values constants in my java code are different. p  pUnder these circumstances, I decided to reuse the class and create separate test pages in FitNesse interface for the games. The problem is to identify the correct game that is being tested in the Java code, so that the appropriate values are set.p  pI have considered several approaches, and currently I created in each of the tests a new column with the name of the game in fact, an input parameter and I set the constants in the code in accordance with this parameters value. p  pI would like to know though if there is a way to send an attributevariable from the interface to the Java code in a hidden way, so that the user doesnt need to put those values in the table. p

Negative 13138 pIve got a cURL request that works from the command line, but I cant figure out how to translate it into the PHP implementation of cURL. I believe that my issue is with the formatting of the data thats being sent, but Im not 100 sure that is the case. This is the curl command I want to sendp  precode curl X PUT d sharedlink accessopen  H Authorization Bearer ACCESSCODE httpsapi.example.comfiles12345 codepre  pI know that command works So heres how Im trying to reproduce it in PHP where I have a variety of other curl commands working, but none quite like this.p  precodeurl  httpsapi.example.comfiles1234 header  arrayAuthorization Bearer ACCESSCODE data  arraysharedlinkgtarrayaccessgtopen ch  curlinit curlsetoptch,CURLOPTURL,url curlsetoptch,CURLOPTCUSTOMREQUEST,PUT curlsetoptch,CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER,true curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS,data curlsetoptch,CURLOPTHTTPHEADER,header output  curlexecch curlclosech return output codepre  pWhat I expect to get and what I do get, when running the command from the command line is a JSON response from the API server containing all the info about the file, including a change to the sharedlink value. What I get instead is a JSON response containing all the info about the file, with the sharedlink value unchanged. This is identical to if I were sending a GET request, or a PUT request where the format of the data was valid, but which didnt match any of the files fields that were possible to update. p  pSo I dont know if the problem with my request is the format of the data this is what I think is the most likely or whether Im correctly configuring curl to do a PUT. I believe Im doing that the way Ive seen it described in a number of other examples, but it still seems a bit strange to me, so I cant be totally sure Im doing it correctly. In addition, there could be some other area where Im making a mistake that I dont recognizep  pIve tried a number of different ways of formatting the data, none of which worked for me, includingp  precode This fails with 400 bad request data  httpbuildqueryarraysharedlinkgtarrayaccessgtopen   So does this data  urlencodesharedlink[access]open  This fails because the JSON gets converted into objects,   which POSTFIELDS wont accept data  jsondecodesharedlink accessopen codepre  pIm running out of things to try.

Thanks CBroep  pIn my sort of defense, the documentation for CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.curlsetopt.php relnofollowhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.curlsetopt.phpa says that the value for that option has to be either an array or a urlencoded string, which is what I was going on. So I was working under that assumption, which was clearly mistaken, since what worked is definitely neither an array nor a urlencoded string.p

Negative 13138 pI am developing an AIR application targeting Android OS, using flex 4.6.0  AIR 14.0 sdk.

The simulator itself does emnotem crash. I can still use the shortcut for the home button and restart my application.p  pI do have 16GB of Ram. I dont think its a memory problem.p  pDo I invoke something on my app when I move the simulator window I cant reproduce this behaviour, but it happened to me multiple times a day since I updated Xcode.

Negative 13138 pI am using the gems a hrefhttpsgithub.commbleighactsastaggableon relnofollowhttpsgithub.commbleighactsastaggableona and a hrefhttpsgithub.comcrowdintrails3jqueryautocomplete relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcrowdintrails3jqueryautocompletea to implement tags on a Rails 4 app.p  pI have a model named codeQuestioncode with two distinct categories contexts of tags codetopicscode and codecoursescode. The issue I cannot seem to solve is to filter the tags for autocomplete so that only the tags from the proper context are offered to the user. Otherwise the basic functionality of tags and autocomplete works fine, meaning that the user can type the first three letters of a given tag, and be offered a list of tags to select from just not filtered by context.p  pstrongquestion.rbstrongp  precodeactsastaggableon   topics, courses codepre  pstrongquestionscontroller.rbstrongp  precodeautocomplete topic, name, classname gt ActsAsTaggableOnTag autocomplete course, name, classname gt ActsAsTaggableOnTag codepre  pNote I tried to change the codeclassnamecode to codeActsAsTaggableOnCoursecode or codeActsAsTaggableOnTopiccode, but got a somewhat expected error codeNameError uninitialized constant ActsAsTaggableOnTopiccodep  pstrongquestionsform.html.erbstrongp  precodelt f.autocompletefield courselist, autocompletecoursenamequestionspath, datadelimiter gt ,  gt lt f.autocompletefield topiclist, autocompletetopicnamequestionspath, datadelimiter gt ,  gt codepre  pstrongconfigroutes.rbstrongp  precoderesources questions do   get autocompletetopicname, on gt collection   get autocompletecoursename, on gt collection end codepre  pstrongGemfilestrongp  precodegem actsastaggableon, gt 3.4.1 gem rails3jqueryautocomplete, gt 1.0.14 codepre  pShould I think of ditching coderails3jqueryautocompletecode and use the jQuery UI widget directly Is there perhaps a way of using the codescopescode option from coderails3jqueryautocompletecode to achieve the desired result Am I just approaching the problem in the wrong way by using different tag contexts in the same model Perhaps override the codeautocomplete...code methods in the codeQuestionscode controller to filter the proper tags Any and all thoughts are appreciated.

Negative 13138 pIm currently implementing OAuth with LinkedIn, and running into some issues. Most of them I think I have already overcome, but there are two last issues left unresolved.p  pWhen I make the OAuth request I get redirected to LinkedIns authentication page. Here, LinkedIn asks me if I autorize the app to have access to some info and it lets me know which info it is. If I change the codescopecode parameter the list present there emdoesem change, so I guess LinkedIn is receiving that OK. That is, codescope  rfullprofilecode asks me for my full profile, and codescope  rfullprofile,remailaddresscode asks me for both the profile and email address. So far so good. Heres part of the codep  precode    if provider.name  linkedin         scope  rfullprofile,remailaddress,wmessages      return  scope scope  if scope is not None else  codepre  pThen I authorise the app, I do get a response, but I only get some basic info. Always. This info includes the following, which I assume is the basic profilep  ol liheadlineli lilastNameli lisiteStandardProfileRequestli lisiteStandardProfileRequest[url]li lifirstNameli ol  pAnd thats it, even though Im asking and authorising the info for the email address, for instance.p  pThen theres another issue, which is the user ID. Shouldnt I be getting it with the basic profile I noticed I can parse an ID from the codesiteStandardProfileRequest[url]code, because theres a parameter for that URL which is the user ID, but is there a better way If not, is it safe to parse from the URLp  pBest.p  pEditp  pThis is the URL Im requesting the profile from codehttpsapi.linkedin.comv1peoplecode. Should it be something different Ive seen something like codehttpsapi.linkedin.comv1peopleid,firstname,emailcode, but I cant find it in the docs, and honestly doesnt make much sense...p  pEdit Im now using the app settings in LinkedIn to set the default permissions, instead of passing them in the URL query parameters. The result is the same, I only get basic info.p

Assigning a view controller to this property either programmatically   or using Interface Builder installs the view controllers view as the   content view of the window. If the window has an existing view   hierarchy, strongthe old views are removed before the new ones are   installed.strongp blockquote
Negative 13138 pI am trying to change the sliced point colour on pie chart. When it is drilled down, the colour couldnt be changed using the select function on the slice. The colour is always changed back to the colour of its parent slice. p  pFor example, when a green slice is clicked on the parent chart to drill down, whatever slice clicked on the child chart will change to green, even though I tried to change it to yellow in the select event which is set in plotOptions. But unselecting it will change the colour to yellow, by clicking another slice. p  pIt seems like a bug to me. p  precode       container.highcharts             chart                  type pie             ,             title                  text Browser market shares.

Negative 13138 pI want to find a way of achieving the autocompleting functionality that the vim plugin DelimitMate provides for parentheses but instead for dollar signs. For example, typing codecode should yield codecode with the cursor inbetween both characters. Moreover, after typing said text within the dollar signs, e.g. codemath stuff herecode, typing codecode again should move my cursor out of the inline math block. Is there any way of doing thisp

Negative 13138 pI have created a subclass of UITableViewCell with a set of UIViews used as containers and labels. The entire cell uses auto layout, and Ive defined most of the constraints using apples Visual Formatting Language.p  pThe issue that Ive run into is that when the tableview is scrolled, and cells get reused, the labels constraints are not being calculated properly. It seems that I should only have to call updateConstraints on the cell, but that doesnt seem to help either.p  pJust enabling view frame debugging in the emulator ends up forcing the currently displayed cells to be realigned correctly. After I scroll again, the frames will be off.

Negative 13138 pBackground I want to draw several Polygons on a map few thousand coordinates in all. This worked pretty fast on Google Maps V1 by Overlays. But Google Maps V2 seems to be ineligible for that. First of all I tried to add polygons directly to the map by p  precodegoogleMap.addPolygonmyPolygonOptions codepre  pbut this is not just unusable slow, it seems to be buggy too, because it always forgets some polygons. Then I tried to draw the polygon on an invisible view placed above the map, by drawing paths. But the method p  precodeprojection.toScreenLocationgeoCoordinate  codepre  pis a joke to its toPixels Google Maps V1 counterpart. Where Google Maps V1 takes 1 second, Google Maps V2 takes 21 seconds, so this is unusable too.p  pThen I thought about giving Overlays a try. a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationandroidgroundoverlay relnofollowGround overlaysa seems to be what Im looking forp  blockquote   pA ground overlay is an image that is fixed to a map. Unlike markers,   ground overlays are oriented against the Earths surface rather than   the screen, so rotating, tilting or zooming the map will change the   orientation of the image. Ground overlays are useful when you wish to   fix a single image at one area on the map.p blockquote  pBut then I read a comment in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14105531whatisthesuggestedwayofimplementingoverlaysinv2oftheandroidgooglemthis postinga that it is not performant too and doesnt even work well. p  pSo the last hope are a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationandroidtileoverlay relnofollowTile Overlaysa. The question is What happens with tile overlays when I rotate the map. Do they change their orientation too or will they stay oriented as loadedp  pstrong[UPDATE]strongbr I tried GroundOverlays and they are pretty fast, even on old Smartphones, so I will choose this approach.p

Negative 13138 pI have 10 functions with generic names which return references likep  precodeintamp function0 intamp function1 ...intamp functionN codepre  pAs you can see only one letter changes in the function name. Each function does a different job. My use case is given some length, say L, I have to call functions from 0 to L. So I want to somehow generate these function names and call them instead of hardcoding all the function calls based on L. So if in a loop where index i is from 0 to L, for each i I want to call functioni. p  pOne approach that I tried was to store these functions into an array of function pointers but that does not work as these functions return references and array of references is not possible. I also tried to use macro concatenation to generate function names but that is also not possible because macro cannot substitute the value of some variable at preprocessing MACROfunction,i does not substitute value of i, concatenates to functioni.p  pHow can I do such thing in Cp

Negative 13138 pI am using a hrefhttpcode.google.comppgu relnofollowPGUa as a GUI for a game I am writing in python3 with pygame. This game is going to have multiplayer in it so I have been working on an ingame chat system.

Negative 13138 pIm extending a server application written in Java to allow userdefined callbacks written in Javascript to be run in response to requests. Ive done some reading, and while it seems possible to disable Java classes in Nashorn, there is nothing stopping a user from creating Javascript code that allocates an enormous array without using any Java APIs. Im wondering if there is any way to restrict this, either proactively or reactively.p  pThe solution I came up with is to have a process pool of JVMs with small max heap sizes, which are responsible for running the userdefined code. There will be a worker pool manager to spawn new processes when needed. This way, the main process, as well as other userdefined code, will not be affected by a single malicious user. While this solution will likely work, it seems heavyhanded. Is there no better solution for preventing malicious users from using too much memoryp  pIm not particularly set on Javascript, so if there exists any other scripting language that can be run within a JVM and also has support for memory usage limits, I would be open to using it instead of Nashorn. Unfortunately, it seems like Jython, JRuby, and LuaJava all dont have what Im looking for. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 13138 pGiven a PDF with Electrical Wiring schematicsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLpDJV.png altenter image description herep  pI have to read through and configure software to match the wiring for specific motors placed on individual emergency stop circuits. In practice, the beginning of the circuits is always on the same page printed page, not pdf page number.p  pWhat I would like are some pointers in the direction I need to go, to be able to trace wires and make a list of components along each wire, to build the circuits. I know this involves both character recognition, and I guess image recognition Being able to follow the lines.p  pAn example of one circuit is at 2012101 which means control panel 20. page 121. line 01 PBL2012101  CR2012103p  pThen the next circuit COS8001  COS8002  ...  COS804  CR2012133p  pThose individual nodes have a standard look, with an exception being, if the circuit were to continue past the end of that page this is just the left half of the page it would go to a box indicating where the circuit continued like from the PushButtonLight at line 01  [2014263].p  pSo I know, essentially what I need to parse from the pdf, but I am having trouble getting started. I have found plenty of results on reading characters, but typically the discussion is about something like reading pages of a book.

Negative 13138 pRecently we are seeing a significant increase in crashes related to COM at our client sites after they upgraded to Windows Server 2008R2. Initially we thought it might be due to COM reference counting issue, but after further investigation going through the code, we have ruled it out.

Negative 13138 pIn my application I fetch some data from my server and after deserialization from JSON to objects Im going to put these objects in my database.

I want to pass a single call to the template and have it do the math much as Im not a fan of programming in a template  Ive chosen to keep HTML generation out of direct scala code  not sure yet if that is a great decision or not... p  pThe Call will be similar to this p  precoderoutes.AController.listconstraint.id, pageNumber, pageLength codepre  pThe args are Long, Int, Int in case that is relevant. p  pI believe what I need is referred to as a partial function I could be way off base herep  pHow do I pass this to sayp  precodepagination.scala.html  codepre  pAnd how would I subsequently call it inside the twirl template p  pPS I have no problems passing fully formed augments to templates  I just want to wipe the arguments off the argument being passed man that IS confusing... and generate those at a later moment in time. Failing that I would have to pass a minimum of four arguments up front which gets ugly really fast. p  pemOf course I wish to make this generic enough to be reusable but I think I can handle that once I understand the mechanics of how to pass the initial augment.em p

Negative 13138 pstrongSome Contextstrongp  pI am playing around with Angularmaterial and trying to see how well it plays with bootstrap. The a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularmaterialstart relnofollowAngularmaterial start projecta shows off some of the cool things it can do, but it seems like it seems like Angular Material still requires a lot of custom CSS for my nondesigner skills. Ergo, why Im trying to see if its a good idea to try to use bootstrap and angularmaterial together.p  pemIf this is a terrible idea, please let me know.emp  pstrongMy Problemstrongp  pThe icons in the side panel of a hrefhttps.codepen.iotroylelandshieldsdebugBNYBOa relnofollowthis codepena should be circles, but they are squares I can see the borderradius property with Chrome debugger tools but I cannot figure out why it is not being honored.p  pTo add to the mystery, when you click one of the items then all of the icons below that emdo in fact become circles for a moment.emp  pCan someone with more CSS experience than myself tell me whats going on or how I might debug this more completely p  pAnd any feedback about using angularmaterial  bootstrap together is also much appreciated.p

Negative 13138 pSo I am writing a program that will soon be passed on to another programmer. What I want to do is make it so he can create a new derived class from parent class Process [the actual code for it, not just a new instance], and it will automatically be added to lists which are used in other parts of the program. That way when he creates a derived class, he does not have to then go through and add it to other parts of the program to integrate it. All he has to do is make the class, and it is useable with the program as is.p  pFor example, part of the program prompts the user what type of process they want to run. If the next programmer is to add a new derived class to process, I want that process to automatically appear in the list of what processes the user can run.p  pSome code... Programmer makes new header file such as psuedo coded some parts for sanity, does not compilep  precodeclass Golay  public Process  public     virtual void runData data     static string processName  golay  codepre  pThe program runs and prompts user what process to runp  precodecout ltlt What process would you like to run ltlt endl foriterate through all derived process classes here     cout ltlt derivedClassprocessName ltlt endl cin gtgt processChoice runProcessprocessChoice, data codepre  prunProcessstring processName, Data data would look something like thisp  precodeProcess process  NULL foriterate through all derived process classes or an indexed map would be nice     ifprocessName  derivedClassprocessName         process  new derivedClass processgtrundata codepre  pThats the idea of it. I want the for loop part for all derived processes to already be created when you make a new derived class header file. runProcess will call functions as needed from the derived class. Otherwise I will just make an indexed map that the programmer has to add his newly derived class to manually.p  pI am lost on how to accomplish this, anyone have an ideap  pThanks Timp

Negative 13138 pI am working for the DOD. The application they have requested is web based, and will be on their internal network. The request is for CAC authentication, which is easy enough... The remaining problem is authenticating a user. The CAC authentication is happening at the IIS level, so by the time the user gets to the application, all I am doing or had planned on doing is checking the ID on the CAC, and comparing it to a user table in the database. If the user exists and has been approved, then they are off and running in the system. If they do not exist, then they are pushed to the registration screen.p  pGiven my lack of experience with web development, I am unsure if I need to actually authenticate the user in some way beyond the CAC authentication, or if I can just manually assign roles to the user and let the roles dictate what can or cannot be done in the application. Windows authentication is not an option while this application is internal for the military, it is accessible from different mil networks.p  pIf I do indeed need to authenticate a user... this is where I run into trouble. I have not found anything that says there is a way to manually authenticate a user. I could use the standard ASP tables in the database, but it seems... messy... to include things that wont be used meaning the password field would always be an empty string  why include it in the db if it isnt being used.p  pThanks in advance for any help... If theres links to where I can read more about the authentication process, those would be very much appreciated as will.p
Negative 13138 pIm working on a web app which makes use of UIBootstraps datepicker and timepicker directives. For the datepicker I am using a simple popup dialog, and for the timepicker I simply have the dialog on the page next to the datepicker.p  pUnfortunately I am having difficulty getting these two directives to work together. When the user selects a date, everything works correctly, but when the timepicker is updated, Im not sure how to get it to consequently update the datepicker as well.p  pI considered two options for getting around this, the first one was to have the timepicker simply update the ngmodel of the datepicker whenever it is changed, but unfortunately this does not also retroactively change what is displayed on the datepicker, so does not work for me. The second option I thought about was having the directives interact with each other, but unfortunately I am a novice at looking at and editing directives, so would need some help with this solution.p  pIf anyone knows of a way to achieve what I want with the dynamic updates, please give me any advice you can offer.p  pHere is the HTML of my schedule view from the Plunker, which is attache belowp  precodeltdiv classcolmd12 containerfluid stylepaddingbottom20pxgt   ltdiv classcontainerfluid ngstylevm.contentStylegt     lth2gtSchedulelth2gt     lt DatePickers gt     ltdiv classcolmd11 stylepaddingbottom20pxgt        ltdiv classcolmd6gt          ltpgtltlabel classcontrollabel stylecolorAAB4BE forstartDategt vm.displayName ltlabelgtltpgt         ltp classinputgroupgt           ltinput typetext classformcontrol ngchangevm.datePick datepickerpopupyyyyMMdd HHmm idstartDate ngmodelvm.date isopenvm.opened.start datepickeroptionsvm.dateOptions ngrequiredtrue closetextClose gt           ltspan classinputgroupbtngt             ltbutton typebutton classbtn btndefault ngclickvm.openevent, startgtlti classglyphicon glyphiconcalendargtltigtltbuttongt           ltspangt         ltpgt        ltdivgt        ltdiv classcolmd6 stylepaddingtop2pxgt          lttimepicker ngshowvm.date ngmodelvm.time ngchangevm.timePick showmeridianfalsegtlttimepickergt        ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coeditWlKMIe5Bu8BqOACluxJAppreview relnofollowHere is a plunkera with an example of what I am trying to do.

The most significant differences are in terms of p  ul liCost amp Time  li liNeed to rewrite the access database to be in SQL Serverli liNeed to rewrite the front end li liConcurrent use.li liScalability of solution and performance.li liUse SQL Server to store the data.li liSimplicityli ul  pHeres the options as I see it.  p  pstrong1. Create a desktop front end file linked to the sql server data.strong  p  pEach user has their own copy on the PC of the front end file.  You manage your own SQL Server database  instance yourself or use MS Azure or similar web service.  There is a free version of SQL Server that can be installed and used on a server, or you can us p  pPROS You dont need to rewrite you front end file.p  pCONS You need a SQL Server instance.  You need to migrate your data tables and you may need to do some work to replicate them in SQL Server, especially if you have data macros, or use special data types like YesNo, Multipel select combo boxes and a few others.  There are free tools that do most of the migration and paid for ones that do more.p  pstrong2. Store a file on dropbox or similar and facilitate sharingstrong p  pThis works if ONLY one user will ever need to UPDATE the database at a time.p  pStore the file on dropbox and use a vbscript like that described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19328371canishareanmsaccessdatabaseapplicationviadropboxherea to grab the file from dropbox to the local disk, allow the user to update it, then put it back to dropbox.  A mechanism is used to stop other users grabbing the file IF another user has grabbed it..  This approach could be adapted to allow users to grab the file for READ ONLY purposes if another user has grabbed it for updating.p  pNote that this method minimises the need to rewrite the database and can use free online file storage to facilitate sharingp  pNote that 2 could be modified to Auto update a front end file stored on a users PC as suggested in option 1.p  pPROS Cheap Minimal changes. p  pCONS Only one user updating at a time. You need to write fairly complex VB scripts.  You need to manually set up dropbox for each user and its sync to c drive.p  pstrong3. Use Access 2010 to create a Web app.strong  The data gets stored in Sharepoint lists, and the forms use macros to respond to the users actions.  Info a hrefhttpssupport.office.comeniearticleBuildanAccessdatabasetoshareontheWebcca08e358e5145ce92698942b0deab26toc262221095 relnofollowherea and video demo a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvAU4mH0jPntI relnofollowhereap  pCONS An old school way of doing it  Access 2013 is better.p  pstrong4. Use Access 2013 web apps.strong This stores the data in SQL Server and uses new Access features to provides a web GUI ie Views.  You can also access the same SQL Server data from a desktop access front end for reporting etc.p  pCONS for 3 amp 4 p  pThe forms that you create do not have as good functionality as a desktop front end as VBA cannot be used  macros are used instead.  But this can be ok in many cases.  p  pA sharepoint subscription is required and this may stop your database being widely available as most of the users will need sharepoint accounts.  p  pYou will probably need to rewrite your existing access forms. PROS More scalable as SQL Server is used.  Easy to create and manage using Access.p  pstrong5. Use a virtual hosted desktop server.strong  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32643313microsoftaccessdatabasecloudoptions3264853732648537mentioned herea  eg a hrefhttpsaws.amazon.com relnofollowAmazon Web servicesa.p  pI need help with this.  As I understand it this might be quite costly.  I have questions likep  p5a  Does each user need to subscribe to their own workspace Do these workspaces need MS Accessoffice licenses  eg If so Amazons would be 40usermonth, or can you just use an Access runtime so Amazon would only be 25usermonth. p  p5b. Can each users workspace link to the same access data file stored on a fileserver or can one workspace get to another workspaces files.  There are costs for having a fielserver.p  pstrong6. Use third party software.strongp  peg 50usermonth a hrefhttpeqldata.comonweb relnofollowEQL Data plugina claims to be able to Run unmodified Access applications, right inside a web browser.p  pCONS Expensive  PROS Might be easier than other methods above.p  pstrong7. STOP using MS Access and write or rewrite the whole database using another language.strongp  pThis is always an option.  My main question here is if you are proficient at Access and a VB or C, will creating the same app. in Access be quicker than in VB, java, C etc.  Mates of mine write apps in JAVA and it takes them ages to do things that I can do in Access in minutes.  Also, the great thing about Access is that its often end users that create the database for themselves and it gives them what they need.p  pstrong8. Upsize the data from Access to SharePointstrongp  pExcept from SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28422670splitmsaccessdatabaseandstorebackendinsharepoint3266467432664674hereap  pYou can upsize the data from Access to SharePoint or low cost office 365. SharePoint tables now support relational data, so basic master to child tables and cascade delete is supported when you move Access tables up to SharePoint you are however limited to PR of auto number, and child records foreign keys must be a long number.p  pDepending on the size and number of rows of data, the above solution is OFTEN better then moving tables up to SQL server. A VERY nice feature of this setup is that your application can continue to run without any internet connection. The instant you find some WiFi etc., then your data syncs.p  pSo I would not write off the SharePoint tables option, as they can work VERY well with many kinds of Access applications, including ones with related tables. And the off line mode can be great for those laptops in the field without an internet connection.p  pstrong9. Use remote control softwarestrong like a hrefhttpwww.teamviewer.com relnofollowteamViewera to allow use of a remote PC and hence the the database.  Only allows one user at a timep

Negative 13138 pIve been working for a while with codeibeaconscode and for testing purposes I bought some devices from a company back in Hong Kong for a couple of bucks each. I wish I didnt... They kinda suck, I really understand why they cost so low.p  pAnyway since I could not come up with anything interesting I started playing with codeiPhonesiPadscode using a mocking app I created to turn them into codeibeaconscode, and the result was way way better than the real hongkong beacons. I also used the codeEstimotecode app to turn codeiPhonescode in live beacons and everything was fine.p  pIm asking now, if you ever boughtused codeEstimotecode beacons, is there any difference between them and an codeiPhoneiPadcode broadcasting the signal I mean, is a mocked codeiDevicecode always better than any beacon you can purchase say for better hardware components Or are just the one I purchased to be shtp  pThanksp
