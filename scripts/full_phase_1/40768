Positive 40768 pIm trying to create a programming exercise for setting up a simple push notification system. Im not sure I have it right, and to be honest I cant say why other than it just feels wrong. On paper, it seems it should work like thisp  ol lipClient requests a page from the web server with a flag to get a token. If a token exists in the database and isnt expired using an expired at timestamp, return that otherwise generate a new one. Generate them using PHPs codeopensslrandompseudobytescode method.pli lipOnce the response is returned to the client, check if a websocket and close it if one exists. Open a new one with the token.pli lipAt a future time when some event occurs, a post request is sent to the websocket server from the web server containing the token as the destination user and a message.pli lipIf the websocket server has an active connection matching that users token, send the message but if not then discard it. Inform the web server if it was successful or not. If it was unsuccessful, the web server will create a notification so that on the users next login, they get the message.pli ol  pIs this sufficient for something simple Is there something Im missing, are there any potential problems As I said, it will be an exercise mostly but if someone tried to implement this in a production environment what do they need to consider for securityp
Positive 40768 pIm trying to figure out the best way for my client apps angular to have a callback with data triggered from a server event. My current scheme is thisp  ul liclient app uploads a document not a very frequent operationli liregular rest server receives it, and dispatches it to a worker over an amqp queue, where many version are generated and shuffled around S3 could take a whileli liwhen workers are done, a message is sent, ultimately meant to trigger a callback in the client side appli ul  pIssues  we will have many cooperating apps on different machines  we have to support IE9p  pThe simplest solution seems to be that the workers put the result into redis, and the client app polls another serverapp whos only job is to hand back results from redis json params and a token to a callback to fire. If this answer callback server does nothing else, it can be plenty fast and tweaked for polling. In our case, the only server push events will be emresponsesem to something the client occasionally initiates. So a client only really needs to poll if they have a uploaded a file and b not gotten their response yet. We dont need all clients polling all the time for random server events like you would for chat, say. I wonder if this means that vanilla shortpolling would be fine, or are there advantages to using websockets or long polling that Im not aware of Any suggestions or pointers to resources welcome.p

It basicly transfers a pile of messages from one end to the other.p  pThe service itself runs great, atleast with Chrome, Firefox and IE10. The problem begins when I start using Safari.p  pIn the case where my JavaScript Client sends data to the Server, the Client  checks the bufferedAmount value of the WebSocket to see if the buffer has gone  empty. If so, more data is transfered in order to ensure that the connection is always saturated.   p  pEvery browser, except for Safari, gives me a plausible value for the BufferedAmount. Only Safari tells me everytime that the BufferedAmount is zero, no matter how much data I send.  This is leading to the problem that the client is sending more and more data until it freezes.p  pI could reproduce the problem on a MacBook 2008 running OS X 10.10.3 and Safari 8.0.6.  According to the logs of my service, other Safari setups seem to have problems too. Including IPhonesIPads with Safari 8.x.  A test on the MacBook using Chrome worked like intended.p  pAnyone an idea about the strange behavior of Safari 8 p
Positive 40768 pIm using socket.io, which works great locally, but once in production with heroku it times out. I know this is because heroku will killtimout a web socket connection if nothing is heard inside the 55 second rolling window. p  pThe problem Ive got is that Im setting the socket.io hearbeat interval to 60000 so nothing is heard for 60 seconds, i.e outside the 55 second windowp  precodeio.setheartbeat interval, 60000 heroku timeout with Idle connection error.  codepre  pI need some way of polling the server inside that 55 second window that keeps the connection alive. Changing the heartbeat interval isnt really an option, so Im not sure how to go about this.p

Positive 40768 pI have to implement a chat application using websocket, users will chat via groups, there can be thousands of groups and a user can be in multiple groups. Im thinking about 2 solutionsp  p[1] for each group chat, I create a websocket endpoint using camelatmospherewebsocket, users in the same group can subscribe to the group endpoint and sendreceive message over that endpoint. it means there can be thousands of websocket endpoints. Client side lets say iPhone has to subscribes to multiple wbesocket endpoints. is this a good practicep  p[2] I just create one websocket endpoint for all groups. Client side just subscribes to this endpoint and I manage the messages distribution myself on server get group members, pick the websocket of each member from list of connected websockets then write the message to each member via websocket.p  pWhich solution is better in term of performance and easy to implement on both client and serverp  pThanks.p

I was thinking of lazy loading or loading only the required fields. But then in that case I would need to create another method which returns a full list of customers including the bio so that 3rd party apps can use it through a service layer. So is it ok to create a method like thisp  precodeCollectionltCustomergt FindAllCustomersbool loadPartial codepre  pIf loadPartial  true, then do not load Bio, else load it. In this case  since I do not want to return the Bio from the SP, I would need to create 2 select statements in my SP based on the bool value.p  pI think using lazy loading here will not work, because then the DAL method can be accessed by a 3rd party app, which might want to load the bio too.p  pAny suggestions on the best pattern to implement in such casesp  pthanks,p  pVikasp

Negative 40768 pI have a two classes, Service and Customer, with a manytoone association from Service to Customer. I want to delete a Customer and any Service that references it. Im using JPA as the ORM with Hibernate underneath attached to a PostgreSQL db.p  pItd be great if I could define the association in such a way that deleting the Customer would cascade to the Services that reference it. But, and maybe Im misunderstanding something, since the association is defined using ManyToOne in Service the operations would cascade from Service to Customer but not the other way around p  pSo without the cascading delete, I set out to simply remove all Services that reference the Customer. Seemed easy enough except JPAHibernate wants to batch the deletes up and executes them in the wrong order My code basically queries the Services that reference the Customer, calls entityManager.remove on each, and then calls entityManager.remove on the Customer. But when I flush it, I get an exception that the delete from Customer failed due to the foreign key constraint. p  pDo I really need to try to commit the delete from Service before the delete from Customer Id rather not as my transactions are container managed and itd be a pain in the neck to make it commit.p  pThanks, Andyp

Negative 40768 pI handle commands inside a RoutedCommand class that implements RoutedUICommand. This would help me to block or override a command by checking their CanExecute and Execute if needed. I can override EditingCommand, ApplicationCommand, etc.. One of the command that I cannot even handle is Ctr  Spacebar. Is it a MediaCommand or some other types that I cannot find I guess it is been handled somewhere else, and thats why I cannot control it.p

Negative 40768 pI have a managed object in a c dll that maintains an anonymous integer handle to an unmanaged object in a c dll. Inside the c dll, the anonymous integer is used in an stdmap to retrieve an unmanaged c object. Through this mechanism, I can maintain a loose association between a managed and unmanaged object using an anonymous integer handle.p  pIn the finalize method destructor of the managed object I have a call into the unmanaged dll to delete the unmanaged object.p  pAll is well as the c program runs, but I have a problem when the program exits. Becuase I have no control on the order of delete operations on the managed side, the unmanaged dll is deleted from memory BEFORE any managed object. Thus when the managed objects destructor is called which in turn calls the unmanaged destructor [at least indirectly], the unmanaged object has already been deleted and the program crashes.p  pSo how can I safely delete a unmanaged object in an external c dll that is associated with a managed object in a c program.p  pThanksp  pAndrewp

Negative 40768 pIn a hrefhttpfaq.perl.orgperlfaq5.html relnofollowperlfaq5a, theres an answer for a hrefhttpfaq.perl.orgperlfaq5.htmlHowdoIcountthen relnofollowHow do I count the number of lines in a filea. The current answer suggests a codesysreadcode and a codetrncode. I wanted to try a few other things to see how much faster codetrncode would be, and also try it against files with different average line lengths. I created a benchmark to try various ways to do it. Im running this on Mac OS X 10.5.8 and Perl 5.10.1 on a MacBook Airp  ul liShelling out to codewccode fastest except for short linesli licodetrncode next fastest, except for long average line lengthsli licodesngcode usually speedyli licodewhile ltfhgt   count code almost always a slow poke, except when codetrcode bogs downli licode1 while ltfhgt  .code very fastli ul  pLets ignore that codewccode, which even with all the IPC stuff really turns in some attractive numbers.p  pOn first blush, it looks like the codetrncode is very good when the line lengths are small say, 100 characters, but its performance drops off when they get large 1,000 characters in a line. The longer the lines get, the worse codetrncode does. Is there something wrong with my benchmark, or is there something else going on in the internals that makes codetrcode degrade Why doesnt codescode degrade similarlyp  pFirst, the results.p  precode                         Rate verylonglinestr verylonglinescount verylonglines. verylongliness verylonglineswc verylonglinestr     1.60s                                    10               12              39               72 verylonglinescount 1.78s                11                                     2              32               69 verylonglines.     1.82s                13                     2                               31               68 verylongliness      2.64s                64                    48                45                               54 verylonglineswc     5.67s               253                   218               212              115                                      Rate longlinestr longlinescount longlines. longliness longlineswc longlinestr     9.56s                           5           7         30          63 longlinescount 10.0s            5                           2         27          61 longlines.     10.2s            7                2                     25          60 longliness      13.6s           43               36           33                     47 longlineswc     25.6s          168              156          150          88                                  Rate shortlinescount shortliness shortlines. shortlineswc shortlinestr shortlinescount 60.2s                            7           11           34           42 shortliness      64.5s                 7                        5           30           38 shortlines.     67.6s                12            5                        26           35 shortlineswc     91.7s                52           42            36                        12 shortlinestr      104s                73           61            54            14                                    Rate variedlinescount variedliness variedlines. variedlinestr variedlineswc variedlinescount 48.8s                              6             8            29            36 variedliness      51.8s                  6                          2            24            32 variedlines.     52.9s                  8             2                          23            30 variedlinestr     68.5s                 40            32             29                          10 variedlineswc     75.8s                 55            46             43             11               codepre  pHeres the benchmark.

When debugging the cursor gets to line that evaluates the query var maxAddressID.., strongthen jumps back to start of the methodstrong, and keeps on doing this until it raises a stack overflow.p  pHeres my generator classp  precodepublic class AddressIdGenerator   IIdentifierGenerator      public object GenerateISessionImplementor session, object obj              var castAsSession  ISessionsession         var allAddresses  castAsSession.CreateQueryselect maxCode from Address a         var maxAddressID  stringallAddresses.List[0]         var previousNumber  int.ParsemaxAddressID.Substring3, 6          return GetNewIdADR, previousNumber           private string GetNewIdstring prefix, int number              return prefix  number  1.ToString.PadLeft6, 0       codepre  pHeres my mapping foe the EndPoint CLassp  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt     lthibernatemapping xmlnsurnnhibernatemapping2.2     assemblyDataClasses     namespaceDataClassesgt     ltclass nameEndPoint table[AddressesContacts]gt     ltcompositeidgt     ltkeyproperty name Address column [Address ID] typestring gt     ltkeyproperty name Contact column [Contact ID] typestringgt     ltcompositeidgt      ltmanytoone nameAddress classDataClasses.Address, DataClasses cascadesaveupdategt     ltmanytoone nameContact classDataClasses.Contact, DataClasses cascadesaveupdategt      ltclassgt     lthibernatemappinggt codepre  pand the mapping for addressp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt lthibernatemapping xmlnsurnnhibernatemapping2.2 assemblyDataClasses namespaceDataClassesgt ltclass nameAddress table[Lookup Addresses] gt ltid nameCode columnID typestringgt   ltgenerator classNhibernate.AddressIdGenerator, Nhibernate gt ltidgt ltproperty nameOrganisationName column[Name of Organisation]gt ltproperty nameStreetAddress1 column[Parkcentreestate] gt ltproperty nameStreetAddress2 column[Street Name] gt ltproperty nameTown column[TownCity] gt ltproperty nameState column[Region State] gt ltproperty namePostCode column[Postal Area Code] gt ltproperty nameDistrict column[Local District] gt ltproperty nameAirport column[Airport code] gt ltmanytoone nameCountry classDataClasses.Country, DataClasses column [Country Code]gt ltclassgt lthibernatemappinggt codepre  pIf I try to save and Address on its own, it works fine, the ID is generated with no problems.p  pAlso if I remove the Address and Contact properties from the mapping but not from the composite ID, and save the Address and Contact before saving the Endpoint, its fine too.p  pIt seems to me that when Im doing the cascade save, for some reason it cant run other queries during the process, but rather than throwing an exception its behaving strangely restarting the method again and again. I havent ever seen a C method do this before. Id love to know if anyone has an idea of how to fix this.p

Negative 40768 pIs there a way to unload the default .NET AppDomain from an unmanaged applicationp  pIm using a third party tool called a hrefhttpwww.etecnologia.netProductsCLRExtenderCLRExtenderindex.htm relnofollow.NET Extendera for using .NET assemblies from within Visual FoxPro which allows me to host .NET controls and also make use of .NET classes and methods from within a FoxPro environment.p  pThe problem Im having is that when debugging an application from within Visual FoxPro it runs the everything under the main vfp9.exe application file for the IDE and it appears that handles to my managed assemblies are not released. So when I make a change to these .NET assemblies and want to update them I have to close the VFP IDE and reopen it otherwise I get a sharing violation when attempting to overwrite the files.p  pI started looking into ways of ensuring that the controls are disposed but then I came across a hrefhttpwww.westwind.compresentationsVfpDotNetInteropDotNetFromVFP.asp relnofollowthis article by Rick Strahla where he basically describes that the problem is really that the main AppDomain isnt unloaded. After looking through information about how to unload the default AppDomain Ive come to the conclusion that this isnt possible at least from a managed application but is it possible for an unmanaged application. My thought is that just because an unmanaged application has used a .NET resource it shouldnt have to continue to carry around the AppDomain and Runtime baggage.p

Negative 40768 pThe documentation below is for a module, which has now been decommissioned and Im writing its replacement. Before i write the replacement I want to get my terms right. I know the terms are wrong in the documentation  it was hacked together quickly so i could instruct a college working on the hardware side of this project on how to use a program Ild made. Full documentary can be found a hrefhttpwiki.ucc.asn.auLURCFrontEnd relnofollowherea for any who are interested in so much as has been written and added to our wiki, the Website may only be available to certain IPSs depends on you ISP  university internet connections are most likely to work, and the SVN repo is private.p  pSo there are alot of terms that are wrong. such as. BR strongdeliminatorsstrong BR strongformatted string containing value expressionsstrong might now be wrong but is hard to sayp  pWhat are the correct terms for these. And what other mistakes have I madep  pre        formatted string containing value expressions      Before I start on actual programs an explanation of     formatted string containing value expressions and how to encode values in them.      The formatted string containing value expressions is at the core of doing low level transmission.     We know the decimal 65, hex 41, binary 0100 0001, and the ascii character A all have the same binary representation, so to tell which we are using we have a series of deliminators  numbers preceded by       are decimal       are Hex       are binary      No deliminator, then ascii.       Putting a sign indicator after the deliminator is optional. It is required if you want to send a negative number.      You may put muliple values in the same string.     eg a2110011110F      All values in a formatted string containing value expressions must be in the range 128 to 255 inclusive as they must fit in 8bytes other values will cause an error. Negative numbers have the compliment of 2 representation for their binary form.      There are some problems with ascii  characters that cant be sent in future versions this will be fixed by giving ascii a delineator and some more code to make that deliminator work, I think.      Characters that cant be sent       The delineator characters        Numbers written immediately after a value that could have contained those digits        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 for decimal        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f,A,B,C,D,E,F for hex        0,1 for binary pre

This is because Im pretty certain that the scope of the dialog needs to be at the same level as the function which calls it.p  pHowever, the issue is that when you click Confirm nothing happens. The submit action does not continue. Ive tried codecompleteform.submitcode also, which doesnt seem to work. I have tried removing the .preventDefault to ensure that the form submission isnt completely cancelled, but it doesnt seem to make a difference between that and returning false.p  pNot checking the box, show and alert fine. Might change to dialog at some point , clicking Cancel closes the dialog and remains on the page, but the elusive Confirm buttons seems to not continue with the form submission event.p  pIf anyone can help, Id happily share my lunch with you p
Negative 40768 pWell, here we are. Yet another proposed practice that my C book has an opinion on. It says a returningvaluenonvoid function should not take reference types as a parameter. So basically if you were to implement a function like thisp  precodeint readfileintamp into    ...  codepre  pand used the integer return value as some sort of error indicator ignoring the fact that we have exceptions then that function would be poorly written and it should actually be likep  precodevoid readfileintamp into, intamp error   codepre  pNow to me, the first one is much clearer and nice to use. If you want to ignore the error value, you do so with ease. But this book suggests the later. Note that this book does not say returning value functions are bad. It rather says that you should either only return a value or you should only use references. p  pWhat are your thoughts on this Is my book full of crap again p

Negative 40768 pI have a C application that runs on a computer connected to a large display in our cafeteria.  The application pulls all the PowerPoint files out of a folder and runs each one as a slide show continuously.  Everything was working fine until someone decided to insert a movie clip onto a slide.

Negative 40768 pIm in the middle of trying to fix my session timeout code, and have run into an interesting problem. Ive taken the recommendations a hrefhttpaspalliance.com520DetectingASPNETSessionTimeouts.2 relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions427264aspnetsessiontimeoutdetectionissessionisnewsessionandsessioncookiedeteherea to assume Ive hit a timeout when codeSession.IsNewSessioncode is true and a session cookie already exists. According to multiple posts, these are signs that a timeout has occurred. All of these checks I have on my homepage before the user logs in theyre redirected to this page in timeout and logout situations.p  pSo lets assume thats all correct. When the user clicks LogOut in the application, I run my necessary database code to end the session, then I run thisp  precodeabandon session Global.Session.Abandon  redirect Response.RedirectFormsAuthentication.LoginUrl, false codepre  pWhat I noticed immediately in my homepage, when Im performing the session timeout checks, was that Session.IsNewSession was true, eventually leading to the logic that thinks theres a session timeout. Obviously it wasnt the user just clicked Log Out. By putting a breakpoint in SessionEnd in my Global file, I was able to see that SessionEnd is fired after I do the Response.Redirect statement when the user logs off.p  pSo Im wondering if thats supposed to happen Originally I thought that it had something to do with Session.Abandon, but that doesnt seem to be causing SessionEnd to fire. Any ideasp  pThanks.p

Negative 40768 pI wrote a virtual machine in C, which has a call table populated by pointers to functions that provide the functionality of the VMs opcodes. When the virtual machine is run, it first interprets a program, creating an array of indexes corresponding to the appropriate function in the call table for the opcode provided. It then loops through the array, calling each function until it reaches the end.p  pEach instruction is extremely small, typically one line. Perfect for inlining. The problem is that the compiler doesnt know when any of the virtual machines instructions are going to be called, as its decided at runtime, so it cant inline them. The overhead of function calls and argument passing is killing the performance of my VM. Any ideas on how to get around thisp

Negative 40768 pOpenFeint has a content delivery system for those who want to have IAP support in their apps. You can just embed the purchasable content into the app on distribution but a much more versatile approach is to use a server that delivers the content to the device. OpenFeint charges 15 of your sales to use their service. I believe this is ridiculously high.p  pI plan on making this service and making it available to anyone but first I want to know what you would think is a fair price. This would come with a simple SDK to interact with the service and download you content but it would also manage Apple payment verification server side.

Negative 40768 pI learned that a signal is not changed immediately when encountering an expression, but when the process ends. In this example herep  precode... signal x,y,z  bit ... process y begin   xlty   zltnot x end process codepre  pThe example says thisp  pemIf the signal y changes then an event will be scheduled on x to make it the same as y. Also, an event is scheduled on z to make it the opposite of x. The question is, will the value of z be the opposite of y Of course, the answer is no, because when the second statement is executed, the event on x has not been processed yet, and the event scheduled on z will be the opposite of the value of x before the process begins.emp  pWell, I need to understand some thingsp  ol liFrom what I learned, signals values are updated only strongat the end of the processstrong. Is this correctli liThe signal codexcode is updated as the first statement. This does not still change the value of codexcode, this change is put in a queue to be executed after the process ends. So everything after this statement codex lt ycode will not see the change and will see codexcode having its old value. Is this correctli liThe second statement is an attempt to change the value of signal codezcode. The same here, z will not change its value but it depends on the value of another process. The change on codezcode will be put in queue to be executed at the end of the process. Is this correctli ol  pWhat does happen at the end of the processp  pPossibility number 1 The value in codexcode is changed so x has its new value. The second signal codezcode is updated, the first signal codexcode was updated and, given that codezcode depends on codexcode, its value is changed basing on the NEW UPDATED value of codexcode. And the example should work fine.brp  pPossibility number 2 The value in codexcode is changed so x has its new value. The second signal codezcode is updated. Given that codezcode was assigned an old value of codexcode, thats the value that codezcode will hold, the old value of codexcode which was updated, but this update is not considered.p  pCould you please tell me which one is the correct wayp

Negative 40768 pI am new to Maven. I am trying to compile Flex using maven plugin flexmojos. I am having hard time to get maven download files from public repository. Currently we do not have any company intranet repository. Maven always fails to download required files eg flexframework from repository. Initially I did not configure the proxy, but now I did. After that maven was able to communicate to the repositories but unable to download all the files. I did try deleting the repository directory couple of times, and also tried reinstalling maven software.p  pBecause, it could not download the files I thought may be I should try copying the files manually into the default repository location .m2repository and did that.

I now need to filter out any duplicate results from this Cartesian Product. A duplicate in this case constitutes any line in the result set with the same quantity of each distinct list element as another line, that is,p  p1,2,2,4,3 is the same as 1,3,2,4,2p  pbecause each distinct item within the first list occurs the same number of times in both lists 1 occurs once in each list, 2 appears twice in each list, ....p  pThe final result set should therefore look like this...p  ul li1,2,2,4,2li li1,2,2,4,3li li       li li1,2,3,4,3      li li                    li li                       li lili li1,3,3,4,3li ul  pAnother example is the worstcase scenario from a combination point of view where the ListOfLists is 2,3, 2,3, 2,3, 2,3, 2,3, i.e. a list containing inner lists of the maximum size  in this case there would obviously be 32 results in the Cartesian Product resultset, but the pruned resultset that I am trying to get at would just bep  ul li2,2,2,2,2li li2,2,2,2,3  lt all other results with four 2s and one 3 in any order are suppressedli li2,2,2,3,3  lt all other results with three 2s and two 3s are suppressed, etcli li2,2,3,3,3 li li2,3,3,3,3li li3,3,3,3,3li ul  pTo any mathematicallyminded folks out there  I hope you can help. I have actually got a working solution to part 2, but it is a total hack and is computationallyintensive, and I am looking for guidance in finding a more elegant, and efficient LINQ solution to the issue of pruning.p  pThanks for reading.p  ppipp  pSome resources used so far to get the Cartesian Productp  ul lia hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20100628computingacartesianproductwithlinq.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20100628computingacartesianproductwithlinq.aspxali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions710670cpermutationofanarrayofarraylistsC Permutation of an array of arraylistsali lia hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusvcsharpaa336800.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusvcsharpaa336800.aspxali ul  h1UPDATE  The Solutionh1  pApologies for not posting this sooner...see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma18671046879367belowap

Negative 40768 pIve got a hibernate interfaced mysql database with a load of different types of objects, some of which are periodically retrieved and altered by other pieces of code, which are operating in JADE agents. Because of the way the objects are retrieved in queries, returning collections of objects they dont seem to be managed by the entity manager, and definitely arent managed when theyre passed to agents without an entity manager factory or manager.p  pThe objects from the database are passed about between agents, before arriving back at the database, at this point, I want to update the version of the object in the database  but each time I merge the object, it creates a new object in the database. p  pIm fairly sure that Im not using the merge method properly. Can anyone suggest a good way that I can combine the updated object with the existing database object without knowing in advance which properties of the object have changed Possibly something along the lines of searching for the existing object and deleting it, then adding the new one, but Im not sure how to do this without messing up PKeys etcp

Negative 40768 pToday, I compiled the Telerik RadControls ASP.NET AJAX Live Demos project which I compiled several times last week and worked in Visual Studio 2008.  I made some unique changes to the solution because our company doesnt use Visual Studio 2010, yet.  See the link below for the changes I made.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7352975teleriklivedemossolutionconnectionstringsdatabasesetupTelerik quotLive Demosquot solution  connection strings amp database setupap  pWhen I tried to compile it, I first got three errors that are shown below under compilation 1 errors.  When I double click those errors, it doesnt take me to the source file.    I then purposely changed some code in a random file to cause a 4th compilation error so I could see what columns are normally populated in a compilation error.  Thats my compilation 2 errors.  Then I fixed that problem I purposely put in, and recompiled again, and got the compilation 3 errors.  Notice the slight error visual differences even though they are the same line numbers.  Again, in the 3 errors, when I double click them, it doesnt take me to the source files.  Ill try getting out of Visual Studio 2008 and going back in... perhaps this is a memory issue with Visual Studio left open untouched for 3 days over the weekend.  If that solves, Ill post that as the answer, and well call it a Microsoft fluke.p  pFYI recompiled meaning Rebuild Solutionp  pstrongCompilation 1 errorsstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUTbhZ.jpg altenter image description herep  pstrongCompilation 2 errorsstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDKmrL.jpg altenter image description herep  pstrongCompilation 3 errorsstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC9spC.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 40768 pAccording to the a hrefhttpshop.oreilly.comproduct0636920010388.doHadoop  The Definitive Guidea.p  blockquote   pThe new API supports both a push and a pull style of iteration. In both APIs, keyvalue record pairs are pushed to the mapper, but in addition, the new API allows a mapper to pull records from within the map method. The same goes for the reducer. An example of how the pull style can be useful is processing records in batches, rather than one by one.p blockquote  pHas anyone pulled data in the MapReduce functions I am interested in the API or example for the same.p

Negative 40768 pIm stuck in a weird problem.  I am currently working on mapkit on iPhone. I need to show two routes in my map, for which there is a source city and two different destination. For a route between two cities my code was fine. for that purpose in one place in my code  i was doing like this.p  precode voidloadWithStartPointNSString startPoint endPointNSString endPoint optionsUICGDirectionsOptions options  [googleMapsAPI stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString[NSString stringWithFormatloadDirections, , , startPoint, endPoint, [options JSONRepresentation]]]  codepre  pIn the above code stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString was passing javascript to my delegate method due to which route was drawn.   Now, i have to draw two different routes, for that purpose i have changed above code like this..p  precode voidloadWithStartPointNSString startPoint endPointNSMutableArray endPoints optionsUICGDirectionsOptions options      for int idx  0 idx lt [endPoints count]idx                NSString msg  [NSString stringWithFormatloadDirections, , , startPoint, [endPoints objectAtIndexidx], [options JSONRepresentation]]         mstr  [msg retain]         if idx  0                      [googleMapsAPI stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringmsg]                  else              [NSThread detachNewThreadSelectorselectorloadroute toTargetself withObjectmstr]                codepre  pi have the following to create and implement NSThread.p  precodevoidloadroute NSString message      NSAutoreleasePool pool  [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]     [self performSelectorOnMainThreadselectorloadComplete withObjectmessage waitUntilDoneYES]     [pool release]    voidloadCompleteNSString message      [googleMapsAPI stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringmessage]  codepre  phere, i have created another thread due to which i would be able to pass strings to stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString separately. But only the last string is passed to the delegate method.What im missing please help me out. im stuck in this weird problem since last week. Any help would be appreciated. Thnx in advance.p

Negative 40768 pI need to synchronize my user table with repositorythe other DB during application startup. I have two Tomcat nodes with Apache modjk. So when I restart both of them I make double inserts and double updates. It seems like T1 begin  T2 begin T1 read the data T2 read the data T1 modify the data T2 modify the same data T1 insert T2 insert T1 commit T2 commitp  pWhen T1 modifies the data and then T2 modifies the same data I have lost update. And of course I have duplicates during insert operation. How should I do the synchronizationp  ol liI suppose I can lock all the table using select  for update for instance and perform two synchronizations. One full and the other one empty.li liI can create special table for this and put STATUS colum there. When one node starts it performs SELECT FOR UPDATE of the STATUS field and changes it to RUNNING. When the other transaction reads the STATUS it doesnt perform synchronization if its set to RUNNING.li ol  pWhats the best solution Any other suggestions. Thanksp

Negative 40768 pGood day everyone. I have a question concerning strongggobistrong and strongrggobistrong package. I am using R version 2.13.2 and Ubuntu 11.04. I am new to ggobi and Im reading the book emInteractive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysisem. The book was published 2007. p  pMy question is how can I export a graph for strongrggobistrong to pdf to include it in latex. For example I have lots of variables in ggobi and I need to export the ggplot like scatterplot of any two variables or parallel cordinates graph to a pdf. So far Ive read that the authors suggests to solve it like thisp  precodelibraryDescribeDisplay d lt ddloadfig.R plotd codepre  porp  precodep lt ggplotd printp codepre  pwhich produces nice graphics which you can use with codepdfcode function. But neither the strongDescribeDisplaystrong package, nor strongggplotstrong are available in 2.13.2. p  pI browsed the web for solution, but I found only that codeggobidisplaysavepicturecode could be useful for image graphs but not for pdf. I also tried save display description toolssave display description and then plotting it with codeqplotcode or codeplotcode. But all I get is a blank screen while codeggobidisplaysavepicturecode gives a good picture. There is probably a much easier solution since R is changing and becoming more convenient to use.p

Negative 40768 pAs a very rudimentary scenario, lets take these two operationsp  precodeUserManager.UpdateFirstNameint userId, string firstName      User user  userRepository.GetByIduserId     user.FirstName  firstName     userRepository.SaveChanges   InventoryManager.InsertOrderOrder newOrder      orderRepository.AddnewOrder     orderRepository.SaveChanges  codepre  pI have only used EF in web projects and relied heavily on the stateless nature of the web.  With every request I would get a fresh copy of the context injected into my business layer facade objects services, managers, whatever you want to call them, all of the business managers sharing the same instance of the EF context.  Currently I am working on a WPF project and Im injecting the business managers and subsequently the repositories that they use directly into the View Model.p  pLets assume a user is on a complicated screen and his first button click calls the UpdateFirstName method.  Lets assume SaveChanges fails for whatever reason.  Their second button click will invoke the InsertOrder method.p  pOn the web this is not an issue as the context for operation 2 is not related new http request to the context used by operation 1.  On the desktop however, its the same context across both actions.  The issue arises in the fact that the users first name has been modified and as such is tracked by the context.  Even though the original SaveChanges didnt take say the db was not available at that time, the second operation calling SaveChanges will not only insert the new order, it will also update the users first name.  In just about every cause this is not desirable, as the user has long forgotten about their first action which failed anyway.p  pThis is obviously being a silly example, but I always tend to bump into these sort of scenarios where I wish I could just start fresh with a new context for every user action as opposed having a longer lived for the life of the WPF window for example context.p  pHow do you guys handle these situationsp

Negative 40768 pI have a prewritten PHP class which I wrote for paging.

One where all content is gathered from the server using PHP and then categorised into pages, making the paging practically immediate so initial load is longer but paging is on the fly, and the other is where independate ajax calls are made based on the option from the user. Which is considered best practise all round loading, SEO, user experience.p  pSome references to good material or tutorials will be greatp

Negative 40768 pI have some existing Core Data code that uses the 10.6andearlier pattern of creating a new NSManagedObjectContext in each new thread, performing data modifications as appropriate, saving the NSManagedObjectContext and thus to the persistent store, and then any other contexts that need the changes can observe NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification and merge the changes.p  pFor various reasons, Im retrofitting this code to use 10.7s new multithreaded Core Data features, by changing the pattern so that all contexts I create are children of a shared context that has a NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType.  I save the contexts, and then the shared parent observes the NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotifications, but instead of merging the changes as before, I simply save the parent, thereby propagating the changes that way.p  pIm also using two persistent stores one store backed by an SQLite database on disk, and one backed by an in memory store.  Im storing crossstore relationships by saving the URI of the managed objects from one store in the other, like sop  precode AFStoredTrack storedTrack      [self willAccessValueForKeystoredTrack]     AFStoredTrack theStoredTrack  [self primitiveStoredTrack]     [self didAccessValueForKeystoredTrack]      if theStoredTrack  nil          NSString IDString  [self storedTrackObjectIDString]         if IDString  nil              if  [IDString isEqualToString]                  NSManagedObjectContext objectContext  [self managedObjectContext]                 NSPersistentStoreCoordinator coordinator  [objectContext persistentStoreCoordinator]                 NSURL objectURL  [NSURL URLWithStringIDString]                 NSManagedObjectID storedTrackObjectID  [coordinator managedObjectIDForURIRepresentationobjectURL]                  NSError retrieveError  nil                 theStoredTrack  AFStoredTrack [objectContext existingObjectWithIDstoredTrackObjectID errorampretrieveError]                  if theStoredTrack                      [self setPrimitiveStoredTracktheStoredTrack]                                                  return theStoredTrack    voidsetStoredTrackAFStoredTrack aStoredTrack      [self willChangeValueForKeystoredTrack]      NSString stringRepresentation  nil     if aStoredTrack          NSManagedObjectID theObjectID  [aStoredTrack objectID]         if [theObjectID isTemporaryID]              [NSException raiseAFTriedToSetTemporaryStoredTrack                         formatYou tried to set a temporary AFStoredTrack]                  stringRepresentation  [[theObjectID URIRepresentation] absoluteString]           [self setPrimitiveStoredTrackaStoredTrack]     [self setValuestringRepresentation             forKeystoredTrackObjectIDString]      [self didChangeValueForKeystoredTrack]  codepre  pAFStoredTracks are backed by the ondisk store.  self is an NSManagedObject backed by the inmemory store.p  pThis code worked perfectly well with the 10.6andearlier pattern.  However, its failing in the retrofitted code.  For some reason, the AFStoredTrack objects that are being returned by the storedTrack method are sometimes just empty shells any retrieved attribute is just nil, and sometimes they throw up an exception saying that Core Data couldnt fulfill the fault.p  pWhats weird is if I add this code to the storedTrack methodp  precode AFStoredTrack storedTrack      ...      if theStoredTrack  nil          ...      else          if [theStoredTrack isFault]              NSManagedObjectContext objectContext  [self managedObjectContext]             NSPersistentStoreCoordinator coordinator  [objectContext persistentStoreCoordinator]             NSURL objectURL  [NSURL URLWithStringIDString]             NSManagedObjectID storedTrackObjectID  [coordinator managedObjectIDForURIRepresentationobjectURL]              NSError retrieveError  nil             AFStoredTrack testTrack  AFStoredTrack [objectContext existingObjectWithIDstoredTrackObjectID errorampretrieveError]             NSLogAFStoredTrack ,testTrack                   ...  codepre  pthen the AFStoredTracks are logged with the proper data, rather than being null or throwing an exception.  If youll note, this is the emexact sameem code used in the previous block to set the primitive storedTrack property in the first place.  It doesnt seem to make any sense.p  psIve checked to make sure that the AFStoredTrack and the NSManagedObject its being accessed from are using the same context, too.s  The ondisk data is all there in the SQLite file, just as it should be if the saves are happening as they should.  Ive even logged the stored URI of the AFStoredTrack objects, and theyre valid  the URIs from the first block and the second block show the same managed object URI, even though the first one gets bogus nil data or throws an exception, and the second gets the correct data. br br p  p[UPDATE Err, I take that back, the NSManagedObject and its AFStoredTrack primitive attribute emdontem have the same NSManagedObjectContextp  precode AFStoredTrack storedTrack      ...      if theStoredTrack  nil          ...      else          NSManagedObjectContext storedTrackContext  [theStoredTrack managedObjectContext]         NSManagedObjectContext selfContext  [self managedObjectContext]         if storedTrackContext  selfContext              NSLogself context , storedTrack context ,selfContext,storedTrackContext                  ...          ...  codepre  pIm getting log lines from this code snippet, and furthermore, storedTrackContext sometimes but not always logs itself as null  Huh  How can an NSManagedObject not have a context  That makes even less sense.p  pMaybe somethings changed, and its not possible or harder to have attributes with NSManagedObject primitive values] br br p  pAnybody have an idea of whats going onp

The customer may have created assemblies on his own which are referring to some of our strongly named assemblies. Now a new version upate of our solution is to be shipped, which should not break the customer assemblies. My understanding is that a publisher policy allows for just that, but we would could ship it only with the update. Is that a problemp  pii which assembly does the last word in that sentence refer to The assembly containing the publisher policy, or the assembly for which the publisher policy defines the binding redirectionp  piii the documentation says that the publisher policy has to be added to the GAC, but it does not say anything about the strongly named assemblies affected by the publisher policy. Right now, for our solution, these are deployed into the application directory and we want to keep it that way. My understandig of the concept is that this is possible.

Negative 40768 pI may be trying to be too ambitious here but Im hoping someone might be able to suggest a solution.p  pI have a number of UserChoice objects, such as TravellingChoices, SocialisingChoices, SportChoices etc and in a users profile, each user specifies exactly which one they fall under, so in the DB they have a single profile row mapped with INT ids corresponding to the keys of the choice options they have chosen.p  pWhen you load the profile up with NHibernate, I use manytoone mappings to build up a profile object which actually contains the TravellingChoice, SocialisingChoice, SportChoice etc objects themselves, not the ids, which is what I want.p  pThe problem is I then want people to be able to search for other users who fit certain criteria, but you are allowed to select multiple ones. Eg users with either one of two different travelling choices, or you can choose 3 sport choices to search on.p  pSo the search criteria object I wanted to have in memory as a number of strongly typed lists egp  precodeIListltTravellingChoicegt IListltSocialisingChoicegt codepre  pand so forth.p  pThe problem is I am storing the search criteria object in db as a number of columns with id separated lists egp  precodeSocialisingChoicesColumn  1,2,6 TravellingChoicesColumn  5,8 codepre  petc..p  pWhat I want to be able to do is have an nhibernate mapping take my table with columns full if idcomma lists, and translate each one into the relevant Typed Ilist with fully populated objects.p  pSo how do I go from the above table with idcomma lists, to an object withp  precodeIListltTravellingChoicegt IListltSocialisingChoicegt codepre  petc.. propertiesp  pIs this possible or too complex for Nhibernatep

Im seeking suggestions for alternative design approaches.p  precodepublic class PaymentRule       Im not 100 comfortable with this, as this will      really be an Int32 value for quantity sold ranges     public decimal RangeMinimum  get set      public decimal RangeMaximum  get set        This will always be a decimal value, but may represent      a dollar amount or percentage depending on the context     public decimal PaymentValue  get set        Specify a type for the range QuantitySold or Revenue     public string RangeType  get set        Specify a type for the value AmountPerEachSold or RevenuePercentage     public decimal ValueType  get set       public decimal CalculateRoyaltyDueint quantitySold, decimal revenue               ...       codepre  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATE 592012strongp  pI should mention that these rules must be persisted to a SQL Server database.p

Negative 40768 pI have on a form a UserControl that I use as a DataEntry form. I show and hide it constantly with new data. p  pOften not all the times the same two memoboxes are shown on the screen first for a second, and then the full control is visible.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions487661howdoisuspendpaintingforacontrolanditschildrenthisa link, Im not sure if thats my solution, but in any case I dont know where to call it and when.p  pEDIT I noticed that it happens only if the program is idle for a couple of minutes. I could show and hide the control 10 times one after the other no problem. but if I hide it and show it again after 23 minutes then I get this behavior.p  pI guess it has to do with the time it takes to reconnect to the MsSQL database to pull the data. But how can I tell this 2 boxes to stay invisible like there parent until the parent is ready to showp

Negative 40768 pIn an experiment with Prolog I would like to use the data provided from a hrefhttpwww.openstreetmap.org relnofollowOSMa to calculate, for example, the shortest path to traverse a collection of points of interest. I have an idea how to do that with Prolog, and even how to access my Prolog program from a Java servlet responsible of rendering the page with the map, or provide information to it if needed.p  pHowever, since I am new to OSM I still do not know how to let the users select a certain amount of nodes from the map, and how to answer I mean, how to draw in the map the shortest path to traverse them given a user selected starting node. Could someone give me a hint about how I can ask, using an OSM map,  many points of interest from a user and later draw a path between them as an answer p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 40768 pIm currently writing some basic ARM assembler. The idea is to control a theoretical furnace and its coolingheating system on the LPC2378 development board with an application board attached. p  pIm getting there as far as recognising input from the devices is concerned. However, im having trouble getting my loop right and I was hoping you guys may be able to point out why my loop is getting stuck, and even after button 1 has been pressed, the fan is not turning on. I previously had the fan working, but when I started trying to control the fan by the temperature of the heater it does not seem to ever start up, and the heater stays on, getting hotter and hotter without the fan to cool it down. p  pIm guessing it could come down to the way im reading the temperature from the ADC controller. p  pPlease dont hesitate to ask if you need any more information to answer the question.p  precode  MotorControl1   BUT1 turns motor ON and BUT2 turns motor OFF   No interrupt support except for Reset  as simple as it gets   WDH, November 2008    Setup interrupt vectors and stack support  LPC2378InterruptVectors.s   After a reset exception, execution starts here  the processor is in ARM  mode and supervisor state with interrupts disabled      SECTION .textCODENOROOT2      REQUIRE vector   Forces reference to this symbol  required by linker      ARM   iarprogramstart  defined start symbol. iarprogramstart   Include lpc2378 IO register definitions include iolpc2378.h   Include Olimex LPC2378STK IO definitions include OlimexLPC2378BoardDefs.h   Main entry point  required by debugger    main starts here  main    Stack setup   Stack pointer r13 or SP is assigned the highest address in a 32kB  section of onchip SRAM  assumes a FULL descending stack convention       ldr r13,  0x40008000     ldr r2,  0x000050    Load the delay value     ldr r3,  0x028       Start set point at 40     ldr r4,  0x000       Start temp difference as 0         ldr r6,  0x0f        Temp High Value 15         ldr r7,  0xF        Set r7 to 15.

Like thisp  precodeprivate Long getHashKeyBitmap first, Bitmap second       TODO this IS costly, it render useless the cache optimization.      also, it doesnt detect that compA,B is the same as compB,A.      much work to do here.      ifD Profiling.startTAG, getHashKey      ByteArrayOutputStream stream  new ByteArrayOutputStream     first.compressBitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 100, stream      byte[] firstArray  stream.toByteArray     second.compressBitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 100, stream      byte[] secondArray  stream.toByteArray     byte[] bitmapBuffer  new byte[firstArray.length  secondArray.length]      System.arraycopyfirstArray, 0, bitmapBuffer, 0, firstArray.length      System.arraycopysecondArray, 0, bitmapBuffer,              firstArray.length, secondArray.length      Adler32 md5Hash  new Adler32     md5Hash.updatebitmapBuffer     long hashKey  md5Hash.getValue      ifD Profiling.stop      return hashKey  codepre  pHowever, this method, according to the profiling I did, cost about 53 ms to run, which causes a lag in the UI that is quite unpleasant.  TIn more detailed profiling, I found that roughly 95 of the computing time is done in the codecompresscode methods.  However, I have not found another way to get the bytes backing the Bitmaps.p  precode0526 175613.220 DProfiling9458 Profile for ImageCompareActivity.getHashKey 0526 175613.220 DProfiling9458 gt          Count  1996 calls 0526 175613.220 DProfiling9458 gt  Total runtime  105765140 us 0526 175613.220 DProfiling9458 gt    Avg runtime  52988 us codepre  pI know my way to hash the Bitmap is quite brute.  But I dont know much about hashing functions, and which parts of a Bitmap I could use to uniquely identify the files.  I dont want to use the filename or something like that, as I want to send those Bitmaps in a database eventually.p  pb[Update 1]b I didnt know about Object.hashCode.  Now, I modified the method like thisp  precodeprivate Integer getHashKeyBitmap first, Bitmap second      ifD Profiling.startTAG, getHashKey      Integer hashKey  new Integer             1013  first.hashCode  1009  second.hashCode        ifD Profiling.stop      return hashKey  codepre  pWhich runs in average for about 18 us.p

Negative 40768 pMy specific problem is that I need to execute a potentially large number of Javascript functions to prepare something like a batch file each function call adds some information to the same batch file and then, after all those calls are completed, execute a final function to send the batch file say, send it as an HTML response. Im looking for a general Javascript programming pattern for this.p  pGeneralize problem Given the Javascript functions funcA, funcB, and funcC, I would to figure out the best way to order execution so that funcC is only executed after after funcA and funcB have executed. I know that I could use nested callback functions like thisp  precodefuncA  function      Does funcA stuff     funcB  funcB  function      Does funcB stuff     funcC   funcA codepre  pI could even make this pattern a little more general by passing in callback parameters, however, this solution becomes quite verbose. p  pI am also familiar with Javascript function chaining where a solution might look likep  precodemyObj   myObj.answer   myObj.funcA  function      Do some work on this.answer     return this  myObj.funcB  function      Do some more work on this.answer     return this  myObj.funcC  function      Use the value of this.answer now that funcA and funcB have made their modifications     return this  myObj.funcA.funcB.funcC codepre  pWhile this solution seems a little cleaner to me, as you add more steps to the computation, the chain of function executions grows longer and longer.p  pFor my specific problem, the order in which funcA, funcB, etc. are executed DOES NOT matter. So in my solutions above, I am technically doing more work than is required because I am placing all the functions in a serial ordering. All that matters to me is that funcC some function for sending the result or firing off a request is only called after funcA and funcB have ALL completed execution. Ideally, funcC could somehow listen for all the intermediate function calls to complete and THEN would execute I hoping to learn a general Javascript pattern to solve such a problem.p  pThanks for your help. p  pAnother Idea Maybe pass a shared object to funcA and funcB and when they complete execution mark the shared object like sharedThing.funcA  complete or sharedThing.funcB  complete and then somehow have funcC execute when the shared object reaches a state where all fields are marked complete. Im not sure how exactly you could make funcC wait for this.p  pEdit I should note that Im using serverside Javascript Node.js and I would like to learn a pattern to solve it just using plain old Javascript without the use of jQuery or other libraries. Surely this problem is general enough that there is a clean pureJavascript solution p

Negative 40768 pI have run into an interesting limit with the App Engine datastore.  I am creating a handler to help us analyze some usage data on one of our production servers.  To perform the analysis I need to query and summarize 10,000 entities pulled from the datastore.  The calculation isnt hard, it is just a histogram of items that pass a specific filter of the usage samples.  The problem I hit is that I cant get the data back from the datastore fast enough to do any processing before hitting the query deadline.p  pI have tried everything I can think of to chunk the query into parallel RPC calls to improve performance, but according to appstats I cant seem to get the queries to actually execute in parallel. No matter what method I try see below it always seems that the RPCs fall back to a waterfall of sequential next queries.p  pNote the query and analysis code does work, it just runs to slowly because I cant get data quickly enough from the datastore.p  h1Backgroundh1  pI dont have a live version I can share, but here is the basic model for the part of the system I am talking aboutp  precodeclass Sessionndb.Model     A tracked user session. customer account company, version, OS, etc     data  ndb.JsonPropertyrequired  False, indexed  False  class Samplendb.Model    name       ndb.StringProperty  required  True,  indexed  True    session    ndb.KeyProperty     required  True,  kind  Session    timestamp  ndb.DateTimePropertyrequired  True,  indexed  True    tags       ndb.StringProperty  repeated  True,  indexed  True codepre  pYou can think of the samples as times when a user makes use of a capability of a given name.  ex systemA.featurex.  The tags are based upon customer details, system information, and the feature.  ex [winxp, 2.5.1, systemA, featurex, premiumaccount].  So the tags form a denormalized set of tokens that could be used to find samples of interest.p  pThe analysis I am trying to do consists of taking a date range and asking how many times was a feature of set of features perhaps all features used per day or per hour per customer account company, not per user.p  pSo the input to the handler be something likep  ul liStart Dateli liEnd Dateli liTagsli ul  pOutput would bep  precode[    companyaccount ltstringgt,    counts [       timeperiod ltiso8601 dategt, count ltintgt, ...    ]  , ... ] codepre  h1Common Code for Queriesh1  pHere is some code in common for all queries.

I thought about rewriting the client to make multiple requests to app engine in parallel but this seems pretty brute force.  I would really expect that app engine should be able to handle this use case so I am guessing there is something I am missing.p  h1Updateh1  pIn the end I found that option C was the best for my case. I was able to optimize it to complete in 6.1 seconds.  Still not perfect, but much better.p  pAfter getting advice from several people, I found that the following items were key to understand and keep in mindp  ul liMultiple queries can run in parallelli liOnly 10 RPCs can be in flight at onceli liTry to denormalize to the point that there are no secondary queriesli liThis type of task is better left to map reduce and task queues, not realtime queriesli ul  pSo what I did to make it fasterp  ul liI partitioned the query space from the beginning based upon time.  note the more equal the partitions are in terms of entities returned, the betterli liI denormalized the data further to remove the need for the secondary session queryli liI made use of ndb async operations and waitany to overlap the queries with the processingli ul  pI am still not getting the performance I would expect or like, but it is workable for now.  I just wish their was a better way to pull large numbers of sequential entities into memory quickly in handlers.p

Negative 40768 pI need to plot a real time graph keeping the background an image. Lets say I am plotting the graph with a red color. p  pBut the logic I use for plotting is drawing small lines using painter.drawline, where painter is a pixmap painter. Then I am constantly drawing this pixmap using a painter to parent widget on a timer timeout event. So it appears the updated Image which is the graph gets plotted in the Gui. p  pThe pixmap is black in background and plotting pen color is red, So when it reaches the end of screen width, I have to start drawing the graph from position 0, but from the second cycle onwards I have to fill the previously drawn pixels not the entire pixmap, just a rect of width few pixels and height, height of pixmap with black color.p  pBut now I need to keep a background image, and draw a graph over it. So the fillling with black color doesnt do, as I have to keep a background an image. So how can I plot a graph over an image like aforementioned p  pIs there any way to blend two images such that the pixels only having a particular color red in source image is blendedreplaced with corresponding pixels in destination imagep

Negative 40768 pIm currently working on a script to be placed on a 3rdparty site...in order to test it Im opening the 3rd partys site and running the script in the browsers console Chrome. Some code I need to executed on window.load, but that code isnt being executed with this method of testing. Im assuming its because the code bound by load to the window is being bound after the load event has taken place, thus never being triggered. My question has two partsp  ol lipIs the reason that window.load is not being triggered in fact because its being added after the load event has been triggered Or is this wrong and there is likely a problem elsewherepli lipHow best can one simulate events triggered on load when appending javascript through the console like thispli ol

Negative 40768 pstrongQuestionstrong There is an strongmstrong x strongnstrong grid  strong0 lt m, n lt 500strong. Each cell in the grid contains  strongkstrong coins k could be negative or 0 too. You start from strong0, 0strong and end at strongm1, n1strong, and you can move either 1 step down or 1 step right, collecting as many coins as you can. If strongk lt 0strong, then that particular cell has a robber and you cant move into that cell. If you move into any of the strong8strong neighboring cells, you will be robbed of strongkstrong coins.

Negative 40768 pI would have a question about models and migrations in rails.p  pLets take an example.

So, I have to create the Car model etc ... Now, I have to modify both models adding codebelongtocode and codehasonecode rules but also create a new migration and add codecar.integer memberidcodep  pI find it pretty unpractical and redundant. Is there any trick letting do this automatically  Furthermore, unlike Symfony2 where model are totally dissociated from the database, here we need to inform a foreignkey column. Is there any way to write something like codecar.member membercode instead of codecar.integer memberidcode  It is a detail, but I would appreciate.p  pThanks p

Negative 40768 pSo Im trying to implement some memory management techniques here. In my program, I created an stl list so that it would contain objects of the class Blast with its respective iteratorp  precodelistltBlastgt blasts listltBlastgtiterator it1 codepre  pIve looked around and found that if you use the erase function, it will call the destructor of the class, and then delete the iterator to which it points to the object and return some other pointer iterator. However, if the class is a POD, then the call for the destructor wont do anything, hence all the information that was saved in that object will be kept in memory.p  pTo go around this, I tried to allocate the object dynamically so that I could use the delete function to wipe it out of memory as suchp  precodeBlast blast blast  new Blast codepre  pHowever, here I encountered a problem. When i tried to push the object onto the list, it only lets me push the pointerp  precodeblasts.pushbackblast codepre  pAt first, I didnt think anything about it. So I continuedp  precodeifit2gtgetX gt 600      delete ampit2    it2  blasts.eraseit2      codepre  pI realized then, that what this does is that it erases the pointer that was pointing to the object, and then the pointer that was pointing to the pointer pointing to the object.p  pIm not entirely sure if that is actually correct, as I have no way of knowing if theres a memory leak. So my question is thisp  pWhat do I have to do to erase the object from memory BEFORE deleting whatever pointer is pointing to that object Is my implementation correct Is its result the same as if I were to just simply push the object onto the list p

Negative 40768 pI am looking for an algorithm that would make it possible to prove emanyem large number for primality.  By large number, I mean numbers with at least 100,000,000 decimal digits in them and which cannot be expressed with simple formulas like Mersenne primes, etc.p  pHere are my requirementsp  p1 it must be completely correctp  p2 it must be runnable on a basic home computerp  p3 It must complete its course within a few weeks or months.p  pMy memory limitation is 8 GB of ram I can set my options on how much cache is available on a dedicated machine with a 1tb hard drive.  I will be considering numbers one at a time over the course of several months.p  pEdit1 I am well aware of the fact that this is a difficult arena to compete in, if not nearly impossible using current methods.  Im not using current methods, and I need a way of proving my methods correct for very large numbers.p  pEdit2 Part of the reason why I need a nonprobabilistic method is because this will be an attempt at an EFF award, and, succeeding there, at a second EFF award.  If my methods are correct and thats one honking IF, I should be able to do all that with my notebook PC.p

Then if its type matches the exception named   after the except keyword, the except clause is executed, and then   execution continues after the try statement.li   liIf an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the except clause, it is passed on to outer try statements if no   handler is found, it is an unhandled exception and execution stops   with a message as shown above.li   ul blockquote  pYet, after reading this description, Im realizing that a hrefhttpmatt.might.netarticlesimplementingexceptions relnofollowI dont understand exceptions, but I shoulda.p  pSo to state the question simply is this codereturn Nonecode statement necessary, and why Also, where am I wrong about how exceptions workp

Im a bit confused  The console outputs the following but the code references to the bundle have not been generated in the filesp  precodeWelcome to the Symfony2 bundle generator      Your application code must be written in bundles. This command helps you generate them easily.  Each bundle is hosted under a namespace like AcmeBundleBlogBundle. The namespace should begin with a vendor name like your company name, your project name, or your client name, followed by one or more optional category subnamespaces, and it should end with the bundle name itself which must have Bundle as a suffix.  See httpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbookbundlesbestpractices.htmlindex1 for more details on bundle naming conventions.  Use  instead of   for the namespace delimiter to avoid any problem.

For example this app is very close to what i need  a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.hl2.hudampfeaturesearchresulttW251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5obDIuaHVkIl0 relnofollowhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.hl2.hudampfeaturesearchresulttW251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5obDIuaHVkIl0a.p  pThanks p
Negative 40768 pI am now making a drawing app where user can import pictures from gallery and further draw on it. Pictures can be loaded successfully and things could be drawn successfully, but i would like to further modify because when the imported files dimension is greater than the screen size, it will only show part of the image. p  pHence i load the screen dimension and the importing file demension and if certain conditions, it will popup the alertdialog such that the user can either choose to stetch or to import that pic by filling up the maximum width or height, keeping the widthheight scale.p  pFor loading the picture, it is in codeActivityAcode calling a method in codeActivityB name as DrawView.code p  h2Questionh2  pThe alertdialog underlines an error codeThe constructor AlertDialog.BuilderDrawView is undefinedcode at the phrasep  precodenew AlertDialog.Builderthis   codepre  pI have tried modified the above as p  precodenew AlertDialog.BuilderDrawView.this   codepre  pbut still fails.

Negative 40768 pEnvironment Windows XP Eclipse Java EE Junop  pOne day I tried starting Eclipse I clicked my shortcut to Eclipse The usual splash screen and workspace chooser appeared.

See end of this posting for complete listing.p  pThe last thing I remember doing that might have caused this problem was downloading a new version of the jre jre1.6.001 through one of those automatic download popups from Oracle.p  pI tried looking in the jre directory but it was corrupted so I downloaded it again. I got the same error when starting Eclipse so I uninstalled Eclipse then installed it again but the issue persists.

Negative 40768 pMy app stores an ArrayList of custom Food objects which are posted to a ListView in the main Activity. The ListView portion of the app works perfectly, but Im having an issue saving and loading these Food objects to and from SharedPreferences.p  pIm saving these Food objects to SharedPreferences by saving each of its attributes as a String, putting them in a StringSet, and saving each one via the putStringSet function. When the app resumes, it reads through each StringSet from SharedPreferences and creates a new Food item with the read attributes, then adds each one to the ArrayList. The code seems like it should work, but just doesnt load the data between sessions. Can anyone help me figure out why Thank youp  precodeCode removed codepre

Negative 40768 pIm programming a turn based strategy game and I have a special single pair shortest path problem. I have a weighted directed graph with nonnegative nonzero edge weights and here is the catch, with multiple travelers, that is units with different movement types traveling together as a group. Each edge of the graph has different weights for different units depending on movement type.p  pNormally one would use eg. Dijkstras algorithm to solve the shortest path problem. But with multiple units moving together as a group and different edge weights for each unit the case may be that the optimal path is not the same as the optimal path for any single unit moving alone. As can be seen from a hrefhttpi46.tinypic.comso7lso.png relnofollowthe example picturea with red and green moving from S to D. The optimal path for red moving alone would be SAD with a cost of 2 and the optimal path for green moving alone would be SCD with a cost of 2. In both cases, however, the other units movement cost would be 5 and thus the optimal path, with the units moving together, is SBD with a maximum movement cost of 4.p  pDifferent amounts of movement points per turn per unit type seems not to be a problem since the edge weights could be normalized. Could this be formulated as a linear program and solved with the simplex algorithm  It would seem we would have multiple objective functions and we would like to minimize the maximum. But is there perhaps a simpler solution p

Negative 40768 pIm fairly new to C so forgive me if this is a stupid question, but Ive searched and I only found something about codestdfindcode which doesnt seem to do what I want perhaps Im not using it properly.p  pAs an example, say I have a basic program that can store your gender. I have an if statement that just checks if the user entered male or Male and then does whatever I want it to do like sop  precodeifgender  male  gender  Male      Do stuff  codepre  pId like to expand it so a user can enter m or M as well, and itll be detected as male. However, I think the if statement would be a bit messy so Im thinking about sticking the options into a simple array and doingp  precodeifgender is in maleArray      Do stuff  codepre  pIs this possible Im not too bothered about any bad practices involved as this is a learning scenario, although any useful criticisms or alternatives are appreciated, as are examplesp  pThanks in advance, hope I made it clear enough.p
Negative 40768 pI have a simple page with a BorderContainer. The top region is a simple ContentPange, and the center region is a TabContainer. On the top region there is a button that creates a dijit.Menu and binds it to the top region. There is also another button that creates a EnhancedGrid and adds it to the TabContainer. The issue is a followsp  pScenario 1 If you create the menu, and then do a rightclick, the menu will show correctly, as long as the grid is not created before the menu is shown for the first time.p  pScenario 2 Any other option create the menu, the grid, and then do the rightclick, or create the grid, the menu and then do the rightclick will provoke a blink in the page, like the page is resizing. A scroll bar will be shown for a second on the right side of the body, and the menu will appear for a second, and then disappear. If you click again, the menu will appear, but opening a sub menu will close will close the main menu, and the options in the sub menu will not work.p  pIve been able to create a small test case. The behavior is reproducible with any version of dojo previous to 1.8. Ive also seen that the menu works just fine if the Border Container has an height diferent than 100 the width does not affectp  pI believe the issue is related to that blink. It seems like the moment the menu is shown the layout is resizing, and in that moment the menu lost the focus and closes itself.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt  ltheadgt   ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetUTF8gt   lttitlegt  demolttitlegt  ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsdojo1.7.4dojodojo.js djConfigparseOnLoad true, locale enusgtltscriptgt  ltscriptgt  dojo.requiredijit.layout.TabContainer dojo.requiredijit.layout.ContentPane dojo.requiredojox.grid.EnhancedGrid dojo.requiredojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore dojo.requiredojox.grid.enhanced.plugins.NestedSorting dojo.requiredojox.grid.enhanced.plugins.Menu dojo.requiredijit.Menu dojo.requiredijit.layout.BorderContainer dojo.requiredojox.layout.ContentPane ltscriptgt      ltstyle typetextcssgt import urlhttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsdojo1.7.4dojoxgridenhancedresourcestundraEnhancedGrid.css import urlhttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsdojo1.7.4dijitthemestundratundra.css ltstylegt  ltstyle typetextcssgt     html, body  overflow auto width 100 height 100 margin 0  ltstylegt  ltscriptgt     function createMenu         var sMenu  new dijit.Menu         var pSubMenu  new dijit.Menu          Para enviar por mail         pSubMenu.addChildnew dijit.MenuItem             label email 1,             onClick functione                 alert1                                pSubMenu.addChildnew dijit.MenuItem             label email 2,             onClick functione                 alert2                                 Aadimos el submenu a la entrada de SendTo         sMenu.addChildnew dijit.PopupMenuItem             label SendTo,             popup pSubMenu               sMenu.addChildnew dijit.MenuItem         label Open          sMenu.startup     return sMenu  ltscriptgt    ltheadgt  ltbody classtundra ecogt    ltdiv idBorderContainerLevel1 dojoTypedijit.layout.BorderContainer stylewidth 100 height 100 background none bordernone padding10px 0px 0px 0pxgt    ltdiv idpanetest1 dojoTypedijit.layout.ContentPane regiontop styleheight 105px gtlt zindex10gt     La cabecera     ltbutton dojoTypedijit.form.Button typebutton onclicklaunchgtCreate gridltbuttongt     ltbutton dojoTypedijit.form.Button typebutton onclicklaunchMenugtCreate Menultbuttongt    ltdivgt     ltscriptgt  function launch     var layout  [[                  name ampnbsp,         hidden true,         field idDocument,              name ampnbsp,         field contentType,         width 8,              name Name,         field name,         width 62,              name Date,         field date,         width 20,              name Size,         field size,         width 10     ]]     var i  0      var gridId  grid  i      var grid  new dojox.grid.EnhancedGrid         id gridId,         query              idDocument          ,         titletitulo,         structure layout          bankerTabContainer.addChildgrid     grid.startup       var myJson  identifieridDocument,items[contentTypepdf,date20111026T161045,documentTypeUSERDOCUMENT,documentTypeDescriptionUser Document,idDocument534044,idUserOFFMARA,nametest II Modules.pdf,size15704]         grid.setStorenew dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore                 data myJson                  ltscriptgt ltdiv dojoTypedijit.layout.TabContainer idbankerTabContainer jsIdbankerTabContainer styleheight 100width 100 border 0px padding 0px regioncentergtltdivgt      ltdivgt  ltscriptgt function launchMenu     dijit.byIdBorderContainerLevel1.resize     var menu1  createMenu     menu1.bindDomNodedojo.byIdpanetest1  ltscriptgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 40768 pOk I have a Problem. I implemented a SlideMenu with jfeinstein10s Library. Im switching between the different items all FragmentActivities with startActivity and Intents. For the normal Transition Im using overridePendingTransition. Nearly all Activities are ViewPagers with TabPageIndicator from Jake Wharton.p  pThe thing is Im using a custom layout Google Now card style with animations. One slide up and one slide down animation. I extended LinearLayout and for for the animations I loop through the childs cards and start the animation for each child. The cards are RelativeLayouts added to the custom LinearLayout.p  pMy idea was that after starting the app the cards slide up from buttom Google Now like and when I switch Activities the cards from the current Activity slide down, then the now blank Activity switches to the new Activity with a fade via overridePendingTransition and the cards from the new Activity slide up.p  pI tried to use a onGlobalLayoutListener for the slide up stuff, but this behaves weird in the ViewPager The first tab slides up, the second stays the way and the third slides up too. The Animation should only appear after starting the app or switching between the Activities. p  pFor the slide down animation I have no clue at all. I tried creating a additional method in my custom layout and starting it with onPause  not working at all.p  pSo I wanted to ask if anyone got a idea Or is this possible at all This problem really drives me crazy Dp  pstrongEditstrongp  pa hrefhttppastebin.com8mDefv50 relnofollowhttppastebin.com8mDefv50a My NowLayoutp  pand this a hrefhttpsgithub.comjfeinstein10SlidingMenublobmasterexamplesrccomslidingmenuexamplefragmentsResponsiveUIActivity.java relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjfeinstein10SlidingMenublobmasterexamplesrccomslidingmenuexamplefragmentsResponsiveUIActivity.javaa is basically my base ui Same method with the contentframe and check for menuframe.

Negative 40768 pIm trying to use matrix algebra with the purpose of manipulating strings. This means being able to multiple matrixlike structures using concatenation and pasting of string or of arrays of strings.p  pI previously tried to implement the thing on R, but it was not possible as matrices can have only one dimensional entries.p  pI hope to be enough languageagnostic and abstract, but Ill use Rlike code for sake of clarity. I should make explicit that I dont require real matrices, but matrixlike structure on which we can do matriceslike multiplication and retrieve the ij element of the structure.p  pstrong, MATRICES MULTIPLICATIONstrongp  pThe ,product of two square matrices strongAstrong and strongBstrong of dimension n is a matrix strongCstrong defined by the elements  strongCstrongsubi,jsub  Sumsubk1,...,nsubstrongAstrongsubi,ksub  strongBstrongsubk,jsub.p  pFor example, consider the matrix  codeM lt matrixca,b,0,0,c,d,0,0,e,3,3code.  Then M times M is  codeM lt matrixca2,abbc,bd,0,c2,cdde,0,0,e2,3,3code.p  pstrongc,,paste0, MATRICES MULTIPLICATIONstrongp  pThe rule of this operation I would like to implement are the same of the previous stated multiplication with the essential mutation that the sum should be a concatenation and the product should be a paste. In other words, where in the previous formula we found codeabcode, now the output should be ca,b, and when we found codeabcode, now we should read this as codepaste0a,bcode.p  pSome of the usual properties have to be respected, namely the distributive properties and the 0 element properties. Hence, if codea lt cq,0,wcode and codeb lt cecode then codeab lt cqe,0,wecode and we should freely forget the 0 element, dropping it as it wont affect the computation.p  pMoreover, we are multiplying equaldimensioned matrices, hence each element  strongCstrongsubi,jsub  Sumsubk1,...,nsubstrongAstrongsubi,ksub  strongBstrongsubk,jsub is now to be read as  codecA[i,1]B[1,j],...,A[i,n]B[n,j]code.p  pFinally, the outcome matrixlike structure should be something that we can use again for computations so for example to make more complex computation as multmultA,B,C and so on....p  pstrongA SIMPLER CASEstrongp  pFor simplicity sake, lets start from the computation of product of the form codemultA,Acode, codemultmultA,A,Acode and so on. We may also impose strongAstrong to be a emsimpleem matrix, meaning that each of its elements are one dimensional string, and not concatenation of string.p  pLets give an example. Lets be strongAstrong a 3 dimensional matrix defined as  codeA lt matrixca,b,0,0,c,d,0,0,e,3,3code,  then the multiplication of strongAstrong times strongAstrong should be  codemultA,A  matrixcaa,cab,bc,bd,0,cc,ccd,de,0,0,ee,3,3code  and strongAstrongsup3sup should be  codemultmultA,A,A  matrixcaaa,caab,abc,bcc,cabd,bcd,bde,0,ccc,cccd,cde,dee,0,0,eee,3,3code.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow would you implement this Which language seems more fittingp

Negative 40768 pHave this design problem and trying to find a best way to implement it using JMS. p  pWeb App has single Listener and multiple Producer and multiple WorkerBee. Listener pushes messages from its queue to WorkerBee. All of the messages produced are queued in a Listener. I want to implement a process than can send messages from Listener queue to each WorkerBee using some kind of load  balancing process. Only single instance of the message occurs in the Listener queue or in the WorkerBee queue. p  pWhats the best way to do it Does JMS sounds like a good choice here How would I push the message from Listener queue to WorkerBee queuep  pOpen for suggestion  And appreciate your response. p

Negative 40768 pI have a few design questions about Androids codeBroadcastReceivercodes.p  pMy scenario is the following when a certain wifi network is connected, detect if there is a captive portal and, if so, authenticate to it. The scenario involves network IO and takes several seconds to complete especially when you need to wait for an SMS with the password.p  pBy debugging the codeBroadcastReceivercode for Wifi state change I found that it is invoked on applications main thread. This was something I didnt know since a few minutes. Im saying this, not asking, because the question is also a consequence of my discovery.p  pDuring the wireless authentication phase, I should handle the case in which the user gets suddenly disconnected e.g. due to hotspot failure, user walking out of range... and reconnected, by strongavoiding two broadcasts to overlapstrong and possibly strongcancel authenticationstrong which eventually fails.p  pAfter I discovered that the BroadcastReceiver is executed in main thread, I came to the conclusion that I need an codeAsyncTaskcode to execute network IO, but feel free to suggest other ideas.p  pThe question is in the event that a consecutive broadcast is fired in the middle of the longrunning task, how do I stop that Indeed, codeAsyncTaskcodes can be canceled, but how can I store a shared instance of the codeAsyncTaskcode in order to cancel it from a different BroadcastReceiver without complicating my life too muchp  pstrongAre Android codeBroadcastReceivercodes emde facto singletons or does Android create a new instance of declared receivers every time it needs to fire a new broadcastemstrongp

Negative 40768 pCan anyone show me how to control javas order of execution while still organizing the code in a simplified, easytomaintain structurep  pI am programming a rather complicated algorithm in java.  One method got to be several hundred lines long, to the point where isolating critical parts of the code for fine tuning the algorithm became too laborintensive.  To simplify the code, I identified each section of the code that could be resolved to a single variable, and I moved each of those sections to their own methods, which are then called from the formerly complicated method.  This is good, because it makes the code readable, and much easier to maintain.  p  pThe problem is that now I am getting some errors that indicate that the calling method is continuing to execute subsequent code before some of the earlier methods have returned their values.  p  pHere is an example in code  p  precodevoid myMethodDouble numb       double first  new getFirstnumb       double second  new getSecondnumb       double third  new getThirdnumb       double anAside  new getAnAsidefirst, second, third       double fourth  new getFourthnumb    codepre  pThe error messages that come up have to do with things happening in codegetFourthnumbcode at the same time when I am getting codeSystem.out.printlncode results in the eclipse console indicating that codegetFirstnumbcode is still running.  Back when I had all the contents of codegetFirstnumbcode, codegetSecondnumbcode, codegetThirdnumbcode, codegetAnAsidefirst,second,thirdcode, and codegetFourthnumbcode within codemyMethodnumbcode, I was not getting the same evidence that code blocks were running out of order.  Because their were no submethods, the code was all in one long block.  However, the code was difficult to read.  How can I make changes to codemyMethodnumbcode above so that each method must be fully returned before moving on to the next, so that I can still have easy to read codep

Negative 40768 pNot sure if theres a reasonable way to do this or if maybe Im missing something. I have a content management system that Ive build that passes everything through a template system which is essentially a single PHP file that does the processing. With that in mind, the following rules will send requests to lucy.php where the url is validated and the appropriate template loaded.p  precodeRewriteRule  lucy.php [L,QSA] RewriteRule [.] lucy.phpsection11 [L,QSA] RewriteRule [.][.] lucy.phpsection11ampsection22 [L,QSA] RewriteRule [.][.][.] lucy.phpsection11ampsection22ampsection33 [L,QSA] codepre  pSo each part of the URL is sent as a section variable to the script. My issue is when Im using a template that requires its own URL system. In this case... a blog. Normally, I would do something likep  precodeRewriteRule blog[09]4[09]2[09]2[.] siteblog.phpyear1ampmonth2ampday3ampblogurl4 [L,QSA] codepre  pto send the request to a one off script. The way Im doing it now is that a hrefhttpdomain.comblog relnofollowhttpdomain.combloga will still go through the aforementioned lucy.php script where a blog template is loaded and displayed. So, is it possible to continue allowing the blog portion of the request to be routed to the appropriate rewrite rule but to also append the year, month, day, and blogurl fields to the query string The blog url will not consistently be the same and may not even be called blog, so I need something that will work dynamically. p  pThe only idea I had was to duplicate each instance of the lucy.php rewrites to include optional parameters for date based structures. Something like...p  precodeRewriteRule [.][09]4[09]2[09]2[.] lucy.phpsection11ampyear2ampmonth3ampday4ampitemurl5 [L,QSA] codepre  pBut I thought there might be more efficient way of doing it. The other issue with that convention is that Id like this to work for other scenarios like category, author, and other nonblog scenarios. I dont want to have to duplicate the block of lucy.php rewrites for every one of these instances. Thoughtsp

Negative 40768 pHere is my problem. p  pI have a main that takes in a command line option, say foo, which is a boolean. Then main calls a bunch of functions, main calls fcn1, fcn1 calls fcn2, fcn2 calls fcn3, fcn3 calls fcn4, fcn4 calls fcn5, then in function fcn5 we reach the place where option foo is used. p  pI can see two choices to pass this option to fcn5. p  pFirst, for every function in the call chain, have a function parameter called foo, and pass foo through these parameters. This looks a bit messy. All functions need to have a function parameter, but for fcn1  fcn4, they are not really used.p  pAnother choice is to have a global variable, and in main, I set the global variable gfoo, then in fcn5, it reads the value of gfoo.

I have implemented it in my way.

Negative 40768 pI have a set of tables in Access 2007 that I need to get to display the total number of items received.  We order items against a job using the job number as a common reference like an ID. p  pEach job has multiple items required.  Most items have multiple shipments we receive.  Each shipment is given a unique receiving ticket number, so they need to be entered individually and totaled.p  pI havep  ul litblJobItems emJobNumber, Item, QtyNeededemli litblReceived emJobNumber, Item, QtyRecvd, RTNumberem  RT  Receiving Ticketli litblJobs      emJobNumber, JobQtyem   and more, but not relevant to this issueli ul  pJobQty is not always the same as the items QtyNeeded. The job is like a run of a certain model of computer, the job qty is how many of that model. Items are sometimes 11, like a case or power supply, but can be 21 or 31 like having multiple hard drives.p  pI have a query that works fine to show the number of items placed on order, but we want to expand it or combine with other queries to show the total number of items received per the job number on the same line.  Eventually Ill use this number to change the status and other functions.p  precodeSELECT tblJobItems.JobNumber, tblJobItems.Item, tblJobItems.QTYNeeded, tblJobItems.PartStatus, FirsttblJobs.BDT AS FirstOfBDT, FirstDateAddww,2,[BDT] AS DueBy FROM tblJobItems INNER JOIN tblJobs ON tblJobItems.JobNumber  tblJobs.JobNumber GROUP BY tblJobItems.JobNumber, tblJobItems.Item, tblJobItems.QTYNeeded, tblJobItems.PartStatus codepre  pThis shows me in a listbox the items ordered and how many, the JobNumber is stored as code[Tempvars][JobNum]code, and the listbox only shows the records that match the JubNumber.  the tempvar is global, so it can be used in a query if that helps anyonep  pIm not opposed to having this go through two or three queries to get to the answer.p

The first thing I tried was to download m4sugar.m4, which I found a hrefhttpwww.opensource.apple.comsourceautoconfautoconf10autoconfm4sugar.m4 relnofollowherea  I didnt really think it would work since I downloaded it from apple.com, but I thought it was worth a shot, I put it in the correct directory, and hit build... This time it displayedbr codeGenerating qgsexpressionparser.cppcode but it just stalled there and wasnt able to give anymore output. p  pAfter doing some reading I got the impression that m4sugar.m4 is somehow not a standard file and that you need to use it while running msys or cygwin.  So then I tried to do my Visual Studio Build with MSys but I was unable to run vcvars32.bat.  Maybe I should try harder with that approach  Anyway to get this m4 file workingp

The other thing that I am not sure about is how to draw the circles so that they are space out across the JPanel.p  pThe Codep  precodeimport javax.swing. import java.awt. import java.awt.event. import java.awt.geom. import java.util.Random  public class keyExample extends JPanel implements ActionListener, KeyListener       private Circle[] circles  new Circle[7]      Timer t  new Timer5, this current x and y     double x  150, y  200     double changeX  0, changeY  0     private Circle     private int circlex  0, circley  0  makes initial starting point of circles 0     private javax.swing.Timer timer2      public keyExample           t.start         addKeyListenerthis         setFocusabletrue         setFocusTraversalKeysEnabledfalse                     timer2  new javax.swing.Timer33, new MoveListener         timer2.start            public void NewCircle          Random colors  new Random         Color color  new Colorcolors.nextInt256, colors.nextInt256, colors.nextInt256          Random num  new Random         int radius  num.nextInt45          for int i  0 i lt circles.length i              circles[i]  new Circlecirclex, circley, radius, color           public void paintComponentGraphics g          super.paintComponentg         Graphics2D g2  Graphics2D g         g2.setColorColor.BLUE         g2.fillnew Rectangle2D.Doublex, y, 40, 40         NewCircle         for int i  0 i lt circles.length i         circles[i].fillg            public void actionPerformedActionEvent e          repaint         x  changeX         y  changeY         changeX  0         changeY  0            public void up          if y  0              changeY  3.5             changeX  0                    public void down          if y lt 350              changeY  3.5             changeX  0                     public void left          if x gt 0              changeX  3.5             changeY  0                    public void right          if x lt 550              changeX  3.5             changeY  0                    private class MoveListener implements ActionListener           public void actionPerformedActionEvent e               repaint             Random speed  new Random             int s  speed.nextInt8             circle.move0, s                    public void keyPressedKeyEvent e          int code  e.getKeyCode         if code  KeyEvent.VKUP              up                  if code  KeyEvent.VKDOWN              down                  if code  KeyEvent.VKRIGHT              right                  if code  KeyEvent.VKLEFT              left                    public void keyTypedKeyEvent e            public void keyReleasedKeyEvent e        codepre

Negative 40768 pstrongBACKGROUNDstrong Im working on a project that uses Celery to schedule tasks that will run at a certain time in the future. These tasks push the state of the Final State Machine forward. Heres an examplep  ul liA future reminder is scheduled to be sent to the user in 2 days.li liWhen that scheduled task runs, an email is sent, and the FSM is advanced to the next stateli liThe next state is to schedule a reminder to run in another two daysli liWhen this task runs, it will send another email, advance stateli liEtc...li ul  pIm currently using CELERYALWAYSEAGER as suggested by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma13945884128507this SO answerap  pThe problem with using that technique in tests, is that the task code, which is meant to run in a separate thread is running in the same one as the one that schedules it. This causes the FSM state to not be saved properly, and making it hard to test. I havent been able to determine what exactly causes it, but it seems like at the bottom of the call stack you are saving to the current state, but as you return up the call stack, a previous state is being saved. I could possibly spend more time determining what is going wrong when the code is not running how it should, but it seems more logical to try to get the code running how it should and make sure its doing what it should. p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong I would therefore like to know if there is a way to run a full on celery setup that django can use during a test run. If it could be run automagically, that would be ideal, but even some manual intervention would be better than having to test behavior by hand. Im thinking something could be possible if I set a break in the tests, run the celery worker to connect to the test DB, continue the django tests. Has anyone tried something like this beforep

Then, the device will push the changes to iCloud too.p  pIm thinking of the following scenariop  ol liThe app works normal without the option to create snapshots its just an optional safety feature for the user.li liIf the user opts in to create snapshots from time to time, hes asked to enter his Dropbox login credentials already implemented.li liFrom time to time, my app then creates a background thread in which a second store and a second MOC and a second PSC will be set up. Every object together with its relationships gets copied into this 2nd MOC. The 2nd MOC gets saved, the persistent store will be copied to Dropbox and the thread will end.li liIf the user wants to restore a snapshot and discard every change made after the creation of the snapshot, my app will rebuild the data by reversely doing whats described in point 3.li ol  pAny thoughts of that Is this save to do, are there any caveats to think of esp. together with iCloud Has anyone done this yet in a similar wayp  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pI was successful in creating a copy of the store with the steps described above. Recreation of the store seemed also to work in some first tries. But, I still have worries about my way of loading the store file pulling the old file away and then replacing it with my saved one.p  pHowever, Ive come across Apples emSave as...em or emRelocateem method p  precodeNSDictionary options       NSPersistentStoreRemoveUbiquitousMetadataOption YES  NSPersistentStore copy  [psc migratePersistentStorecurrentiCloudStore                                                 toURLurl                                               optionsoptions                                              withTypeNSSQLiteStoreType                                                 erroramperror] codepre  pwhich will remove all iCloud associated metadata, and also removes the current store from the coordinator I dont want that and adds the newly created store to the PSC I dont want that either.p  pWhat is the better way to go My current approach or Appless built in emSave as...

Negative 40768 pIn a spring mvc application using hibernate and jpa, I have a query that needs to return all the records whose date falls within a specified day.

I manage them using socket.io and there is also redis available.

And I need to avoid this somehow.p  pSaying briefly, I need a kind of collection which will behave a kind of strongadd items one by one, until adding next item would cause OutOfMemoryErrorstrong, but Im not experienced enough to find a proper approach. I believe, some sort of weakreference collection should be implemented.p  pI like codeWeakHashMapcode, but there is one crucial problem with it  I cannot control how items will be discarded. In my app, bitmaps are added in order of priority the most important bitmaps, that should be stored as long as possible, go first. codeWeakHashMapcode, as I understand, doesnt provide such prioritization. p  pAny working approaches or ideasp  pemP. S. This question is not about bitmap optimization. Imagine, there are some big objects instead of bitmaps, that cannot be compressed or optimized. The question is about strongstoring items in memory directly controlling their priority, such that objects with low priority can be GCd quickly or not added at allstrong.emp  hr  pP. P. S. So far, I discovered two possible solutionsp  p1 dividing a collection in 2 parts, such that first, more prioritized, will contain emitems themselvesem i. e. strong references, and second will contain emsoft referencesem. Control of adding can be processed using codeRuntime.getRuntime.maxMemorycode and code.totalMemorycodewhen totalMemory occupied by the heap exceeds some  of maxMemory, adding new items into collection should be prohibitedp  p2 using a collection of soft references and track items codefinalizecodewhen it is invoked i. e. corresponding object is going to be picked by GC, return this item as a soft reference back to the collection and replace another itemwith least priorityby phantom reference. Theoretically, this would give more strict priority control, but Im not sure how it will behave in practice.p

Negative 40768 pI am working on a webpart which makes use of 5 dropdowns each dropdown represents Project table columns like projectNo, ProjectPM, ContractNo etc. The table has more than 3000 items, so when the dropdownlists are finally databound, they have more than 3000 items to load, which pretty much brings IE to a halt.p  pWhat is the best way to go about architecting a solution, so users can still make use of the dropdown list interface, may be like first rendering an empty dropdownlist and then using a modal window to first find the project number they are looking for and then set the item as selected in the dropdownlist.

Negative 40768 pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLazyevaluation relnofollowLazy evaluationa is said to be a way of delaying a process until the first time it is needed. This tends to avoid repeated evaluations and thats why I would imagine that is performing a lot faster.

Negative 40768 pIm in the process of cleaning up messy JavaScript code. In this code, I need to react to the codebeforechangecode event of the codepagecontainercode for example to redirect the user to a login page.p  pIn the messy code everything works as intended, i.e. the code got the event, reasoned about what to do, and did it.p  pHowever, Id like to clean up the code by separating concerns using the MVC pattern. For that, I have a view that knows when the codebeforechangecode event is fired for the corresponding page, and a controller that is informed by that view to react on that.p  pHowever, the controller must register itself in the view before the first event is fired. So far I had no luck achieving this, i.e. the view first informed all registered controllers, and only after that the controller registered itself.p  pWhat is a clean way to do something before codebeforechangecode is fired Just writing the registration inside the outermost scope is there a name for that does not help, as then the order of files is important. In other words, I need all JavaScript files to be parsed before I can actually start running code.p  pIs there another way to deal with such problemsp

I also have attempted setting TreeViewNode text and experience the same result.

Negative 40768 pI am starting to use the RProvider. For starters, I have just tried to evaluate functions in different ways. It seems I have already run into problems perhaps a problem with my understanding of how the RProvider works. I have run the same function in four different ways, which I thought to be equivalent. However, the four example provides me with two different results.p  precodeR.sapplyR.c1,2,3,4,5, R.evalR.parsetextmean.GetValueltfloat[]gt   val it  float []  [1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0] R.sapplyR.c1,2,3,4,5,mean.GetValueltfloat[]gt   val it  float []  [1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0] R.meanR.c1,2,3,4,5.GetValueltfloat[]gt   val it  float []  [3.0] R.evalR.parsetextmeanc1,2,3,4,5.GetValueltfloat[]gt   val it  float []  [3.0] codepre  pCan anyone tell me why this is My own guess is that codeR.sapplycode applies the given function elementwise.

Negative 40768 pI am working on a website where users can book vacation houses.  Booking always is from saturday to saturday. If users click on any date in that week, the whole week must be selected.

Negative 40768 pIm pretty much a complete beginner when it comes to PHP and have been having some problems with updating the values in the database  when the script fires it updates every users value in the column rather than just the individual who is logged in. p  pSome background info p  pDatabase name userp  pTable users with columns User ID , Username , Password , Emailaddress , Offer. p  pSite that Im working on allows users to complete a number of offers and then get rewarded upon completion. The offer column has the default value of 1 and Upon login the user is redirected according to the value in the offer column. So on first login user is redirected to example.comoffer1 , after offer 1 is completed this value is updated so on next login user is redirected to example.comoffer2  in essence storing the users progress p  pThis is the script which is played after an offer is completed in this case after offer 3 is completed  aim to connect to database and then update that users offer value so when they next login they will be directed to the correct offer  thus storing their progressp  precodeltphp sessionstart con  mysqliconnectlocalhost,name,pass,user select  mysqlifetchassocmysqliquerycon,SELECT offer FROM users      WHERE Username  .SESSION[username]. plus  select[offer] mysqliquerycon,UPDATE users SET offer3.plus headerlocation httpexample.comoffer4.plus gt codepre  pThis does work in updating the values but does so for emall usersem in the database rather than just the one user who is logged in. So lets say Jim has completed this offer , his Offer value will be updates to 3 but so will all the other users will have their offer value set to 3 when only Jims should be.  hope that this makes sense.

Negative 40768 pMy question is rather simple What is the recommended way to implement the typographic and metric rules of Material Design a hrefhttpwww.google.comdesignspecmaterialdesignintroduction.htmlhttpwww.google.comdesignspecmaterialdesignintroduction.htmla in a Polymer application For example, how to implement the units sp and dp in CSSp  pIs there an official CSS file I could include I am also not sure whether the Core and the Paper Elements of Polymer all conform to the general rules of Material Design. It says that the Topeka application bundled with Polymer is an example of Material Design. However, I havent understood this by reading its source and in particular its style sheets. For example, the profile screen a hrefhttpsgithub.comPolymertopekaelementsblobmastertopekaprofile.htmlhttpsgithub.comPolymertopekaelementsblobmastertopekaprofile.htmla does not follow all the metric rules, does it Or am I completely mistakenp

Negative 40768 pI have been developing web applications lately using Codeigniter framework, have also worked with Opencart for a few years. Ive read on MVC implementation in PHP and understand that there is a lot of disagreement regarding the purity or correctness of the MVC pattern as applied in various PHP MVC frameworks. I want to ask the more experienced guys here what would be the more correct way to deal with the following situation.p  pI have a database with arbitrary data, say emtable1em, emtable2em, .emtable3em that each have a slightly different schema.p  pI strive to make my SQL queries as generic as possible, so I use variables like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM .sTable. WHERE .sUserRefCol.  123 codepre  pI also store each table specific information in configuration array, likep  precodeconfig[dbmap][1]  array     table  table1,     userref  sellerid,     cols  array...  codepre  pSo, based on user input POST parameter, I get DB variables for specific section. I am not sure whether this mapping should happen in the controller or I can do it in model.p  pRight now, I do this in the controller, likep  precodesection  POST[id] dbmap  config[dbmap][section] sTable  dbmap[table] sUserRefCol  dbmap[userref] ... codepre  pThen I pass all these to the model method, likep  precodethisgtmymodelgtgetdatasection, sTable, sUserRefCol codepre  pSo, my question is Could I just pass the section id to the model and let it handle the loading of the configurationp  pAnother example, instead of POST parameter, say we have a session variable pertaining to user section or department or access rights etc.p  pShould I read these values in the controller, then call the appropriate model method with appropriate parameters Or I could just do a straight call top  precodethisgtmymodelgtmysmartmethod codepre  pthat would read the session vars and perform appropriate operationp

Negative 40768 pIve got the situation that I have to load a child application context, where I dont know if certain configurations are already loaded by the parent application context. In order to not instantiate services twice I want to load only Configuration classes that are not already present in the parent application context.p  pIve already implemented an ImportSelector that checks the parent application context. This works, but fails with transitive dependencies declared via Import on Configuration classes loaded in the child application context. With an ImportSelector I can check if a Configuration is already in the parent application context, but if it is not, then Ive found no way to prevent that an Imported class on the Configuration to be added is NOT imported into the child context because its already available in the parent context.p  pAny help is welcomep  pThanks Peterp

Negative 40768 pIm working on an angular web application that must support IE10. I need to make a cross domain call to our enterprise salesforce server.

But I get an Access is Denied. error thrown from deep inside the angular code.p  pFurther digging reveals that the specific line in angular v1.2.21 that is failing isp  precodexhr.openmethod, url, true on line 8544 if you happen to have version 1.2.21. codepre  pIn looking at a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularangular.jsissues4288 relnofollowgithuba, a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicangularkvolRc490 relnofollowgoogle groupsa, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5087549accessdeniedtojqueryscriptoniestack overflowa threads, I see that the issue might be with the way IE wants to handle cross domain requests, specifically which xhr object is being invoked to make the call.p  pIt seems that older versions of angular had this issue, but it was addressed by adding a function prior to the codexhr.opencode call to retrieve the correct codeXMLHttpRequestcode object for the version of IE that is runningp  precodevar xhr  createXhrmethod  xhr.openmethod, url, true forEachheaders, functionvalue, key    if isDefinedvalue        xhr.setRequestHeaderkey, value     codepre  pSo in theory, the correct xhr object is having its code.opencode method called. However for me, that line throws an Access is Denied error.p  pIn the links above, it seems commonly suggested that instead of using the codeXMLHttpRequestcode object for cross domain calls, you have to use codeXDomainRequestcode. Thinking it was unlikely that the angular folks missed this, I tried it anyway, just manually altering the code in the angular.js file to return that object for our specific salesforce callp  precodevar xhr if url.indexOfsalesforce.com gt 1    xhr  new XDomainRequest  else    xhr  createXhrmethod   xhr.openmethod, url, true forEachheaders, functionvalue, key    if isDefinedvalue        xhr.setRequestHeaderkey, value     codepre  pExcept now the line where the code tries to call codexhr.setRequestHeaderkey, valuecode fails.

File sizes are typically in the 500KB range so the total transfer time shouldnt be more than a few seconds.p  pIve changed the code to move the file to a directory same physical drive on the same server outside of the FTP root prior to processing and Im seeing the same behavior.  The code.MoveTocode call always seems to complete, its the subsequent access that isometimesi fails. Even if moving the file to a different directory worked, I wouldnt be happy not knowing what is going on. p  pIve just changed the code to move the file to a different directory on a different physical drive.  Is it possible that the code.MoveTocode call could complete while the file is still being transferred if the move is to the same physical drive I guess in that instance, maybe the code.MoveTocode could just update the file metadata and not need access to the actual bits  The subsequent file access would then fail because the file is still being written p  pWeve applied this a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb2723776 relnofollowhotfixa, installed all updates, and rebooted.  Ive searched SO and all other file access issues seem to be related to the actual FTP transfer, not subsequent access.p  pIm still working through this in trialanderror fashion. Just wondering if anyone could offer some insight.  At this point, I dont care if your advice is to pray to a head of lettuce named Fred, Ill try anything.p  precode    private void TimerElapsedobject sender, ElapsedEventArgs e              this.timer.Stop          var files  new DirectoryInfothis.config.Path.GetFiles          for int i  0 i lt files.Length i                                         this.PreProcessFilefiles[i]                                   this.timer.Start           private void PreProcessFileFileInfo file              const int MAXRETRIES  10          try                         string workFile  CTemp  Guid.NewGuid.ToString  file.Extension              Task.Factory.StartNew gt                               20141110 FJL Ive tried having the .MoveTo within and outside of the task.

If it doesnt do this, how does the requesting system know that the request has been received and is being worked on, or doesnt it know thisp

In Maya I select all the meshes and use MeshCombine after that the model is still working and I can drag and drop animations on it and it works well. If I try to export this new model with combined meshes I get and error saying Unsupported Operation on Mesh Vertices 1. I did a lot of search on this error message and all I could find was to editDelete All by Type and click on NonDeformer History. This does not work after I combined the meshes though, I get an error saying it can not be done with reference to the newly created polymesh. I tried to delete the history and then combine the meshes. that gave no error when exporting but it only saved the models nodes, no mesh at all.p  pIf I do not combine the meshes I can export to FBX and then import into my game but then I have the problem of too many draw calls and I am developing for mobile.p

Negative 40768 pThis is my first time asking a question here but I have a problem that I really cant wrap my head around which is Prolog recursion especially when it deals with list. So the task that I am supposed to solve is to write a drop predicate that works like this. For example, codedrop[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], 2, Lcode where codeL  [1,3,5,7,9]code and codeNncode where elements at position n, 2n, 3n.... will be removed. The list starts from 1 is another thing to be noted. p  pHere is my attempt so far and thought process p  precodedrop[], , [].  indexOf[X], X, 1. Using 1 because the question says the first element starts from 1.  indexOf[Ys], Y , I     indexOfYs, Y, N,     I is N  1.  drop[XXs], Y, [X]      indexOf[XXs] , X , A,     Z is A mod Y,     Z  0.  drop[XXs], Y, Zs      indexOf[XXs], X, A,     dropXs, Y, Zs. codepre  pI created an codeindexOfcode predicate to find the index of the elements starting from 1 . Next, my idea was to use the my first drop recursive case in the code above it is the 5th case to check and see whether the position of the element returns a remainder of zero when divided by the codeYcode second input. if it does not return a remainder of zero, then the codeXcode remains inside the list and is not dropped. Then, prolog moves on to the 2nd drop recursive case which can only be arrived when codeZ0code and it will drop codeXcode from the list to return codeZcodes. In essence, an element with index n, 2n, 3n... that is returned by codeindexOfcode will be dropped if it does not return a remainder of zero when divided by codeYcode second input.p  pI have not learnt Cut at this point of the course at the moment. I would appreciate if someone can point me to the right direction. I have been working on this for almost a day.p  pI am still trying to adapt the logic and declarative thinking in this programming paradigm. I would appreciate it if you could share with me, how did you personally go about mastering Logic programmingp

Negative 40768 pI tried to ask this question on the Raspberry Pi forums, but I have received no responses at all.  I thought I might query the minds of the StackOverflow community that has been so helpful in the past.p  pIm writing a userspace driver for the Raspberry Pi specifically, may be ported to other platforms later which makes use of the bcm2835 library GPIO and uinput Linux userinput virtual devices. I need to read GPIO pins and translate their values into simulated keypresses on a virtual keyboard. The GPIO part has been completed, and the translation part is also completed. Unfortunately, the virtualkeyboard part has not been solved. Uinput refuses to cooperate.p  pNow, the exact same code works perfectly on a Debian desktop machine.  The codeevdevcode and codeuinputcode modules are required, both of which were loaded in all test cases.  On the desktop, inputs can be triggered, however, on the Raspberry Pi, I can verify that the GPIO subsystem has registered the input, but the uinput events do not trigger.  Does anyone have a lead on what I might dop  pThank you very much, if you need any information, logs, or otherwise, please let me know and I will post them as soon as I can.p

Negative 40768 pI need to detect user dynamics in my application. I started by using GooglePlayServicesClient which till three months ago worked perfectly, Then it stopped working on my HTC one device although it was still working on three different devices Ive checked. I know it is now replaced by GoogleApiClient, so I thought this was my problem, but it keeps not working even after changing to the new API. The problem is that the intent given to ActivityRecognition.ActivityRecognitionApi.requestActivityUpdates is never called. I used the same implementation as  a hrefhttpsblacode.wordpress.com20141226useractivityrecognitionthroughnewactivityrecognitionapiinandroidactivityrecognitionclientdeprecated relnofollowhttpsblacode.wordpress.com20141226useractivityrecognitionthroughnewactivityrecognitionapiinandroidactivityrecognitionclientdeprecateda And again, this implementation works on three other devices but not on HTC one.p  pI did some reading online and I saw some similar issues that were solved by updating google play or activating google play location services or disable mock location on the android developers settings. Non worked for me.p  pHas anyone encountered the same problem or maybe has some idea what can be the cause p

Negative 40768 pI am working on a project involving a Java backend with Delphi frontend. I am attempting to generate XML bindings based off of an .xsd in java. The XSD contains a object called TaskList which has item Tasks. Tasks is a list of Task. When I generate the XML bindings Delphi attempts a CreateCollection function using TXMLTaskList but throws an error because TXMLTaskList is IXMLNode instead of IXMLNodeCollection.p  pI am still new to using XSD files and the XML bindings generation feature but based off of what little I do understand I was assuming since TaskList contains a single object Tasks that it should not be getting used in the CreateCollection Function, instead I would think that Tasks which is a list of Task should be getting used.p  pThis is the line that my XML bindings file is throwing an error onp  precodeFExportOnClientChange  CreateCollectionTXMLTaskList, IXMLTask,    exportOnClientChange as IXMLTaskList codepre  pThis is my TXMLTaskLisk, showing that it is an TXMLNode instead of TXMLNodeCollectionClass which CreateCollection is looking for.p  precodetype   TXMLTaskList  classTXMLNode, IXMLTaskList   protected      IXMLTaskList      function GetTasks IXMLTasks   public     procedure AfterConstruction override   end codepre  pIn my attemps to figure out the problem I did notice that if I make TaskList an unbounded list of tasks and leave tasks as an unbounded list of task that everything generates fine in the delphi xml file, but that would mean that I have a list of a list which is not what I am wanting.p  pOne thing that might be hard to tell here is that TaskList and tasks are in different XSD files although they are linked.p  precodeltcomplexType nameTaskListgt     ltsequencegt         ltelement nametasks typestructtasksgtltelementgt     ltsequencegt ltcomplexTypegt   ltcomplexType nametasksgt     ltsequencegt         ltelement refstructtask maxOccursunbounded minOccurs0gtltelementgt     ltsequencegt ltcomplexTypegt codepre

Negative 40768 pI am newbie to MFC. I have a native C MFC app. I want to show a dialog from main dialog. In the main dialog I am having three button Back, Next, Cancel respectively. On the Next button click event I am calling DoModal to show another dialog by hiding the main dialog as follows,p  precodevoid CFirstPageOnBnNextButton      ShowWindowthisgtGetSafeHwnd,SWHIDE     CSecondPage secondDlg     secondDlg.DoModal  void CSecondPageOnBnBackBtnClicked      ShowWindowthisgtGetSafeHwnd,SWHIDE     CFirstPage FirstPage     FirstPage.DoModal  codepre  pAfter executing this code snippet, the main dialog got hidden and even the application icon also disappears from the taskbar and again appears when the other dialog pops up. Basically I am having the same icon for both the dialogs, the icon should not get disappeared and appear again. It has to remain same without appearing and disappearing .p  pHow can show the icon in the taskbar without any flickering effectp  pDuring traversing from back to next in middle I clicked cancel and the Cancel event is handled as follows,p  precodevoid CFirstPageOnCancel      CDialogEndDialogTRUEFor closing the dialog.  void CSecondPageOnCancel      CDialogEndDialogTRUEFor closing the dialog.  codepre  pSteps1Click Next in the main dialogp  pStep2 Click Cancel in the second pagep  pNow the application closes. But still instance is active in the TaskManager. As per my understanding no instance should be alive once windows is closed  I suspect as the first dialog is only hidden not ended that instance is still existing in the TaskManager. Is this understanding correctp  pHow can I resolve this issuep  pCan anyone kindly help me to resolve this issue.p
Negative 40768 pI work for a company which handles some websites that have educational forms prospective students can fill out if they wish to be contacted by a college.p  pWe have attempts coming in from two overseas countries, which are continually filling out and attempting to submit forms using ridiculously bogus information. The only possible outcome if these were to go through would be that the school would try to call them.p  pI cannot figure out how this could potentially benefit them, in any way shape or form. It seems like its probably a bot, because they are inserting integers for first name, last name, and email address. Ive even considered that some companies Ive heard of boost their site traffic unethically by having people or bots falsely cause hits on their pages, etc. I dont think thats the case here but Im not sure.p  pThis isnt my project, but someone mentioned it to me and I found it intriguing. What possible benefit would a bot or hacker have from doing this Each attempt has been unsuccessful but even if it got through, whats the point Did someone actually send a bot to try and spam educational websites where all you can do is submit an inquiry to a school Whats going on here, ideasp  pMy best guess is that its a bot someone put out there and its hitting our site by mistake. I dont get it, but Im not a security ninja. I would love possible scenarios, preferably evidencefactbased, not opinions if you cant back it up  nothing personal, its just that I know these are the rules of Stack Overflow. p  pSo if you have a factbased hypothesis why this may be happening, I would love to understand the howwhy...p

Negative 40768 pI am relatively new to R and I am trying to process a lot of weather data stored in a data frame. My goal is to loop through the data and compare the Element column of my data frame to several values.

Currently the element column is a factor with 24 levels.

However, I am wondering if this would be the most efficient way to do this. Even though only one field is being updated, would it cost me the same as writing a million entities into the datastorep  pAnother approach could be to remove codemembercountcode from the codeForumcode model and create a new model to store only the codemembercountcode field, like sop  precodeclass ForumMemberCountndb.Model     forum  ndb.KeyPropertykindForum     membercount  ndb.IntegerProperty codepre  pWill updating this model be cheaper since it has fewer fields However, since the datastore does not support joins, I will have to fetch both the codeForumcode and codeForumMemberCountcode entities and programmatically join them  does this approach really help and would it cost me less in terms of datastore operationsp  pWhat would be the best practice when I need to update a large number of rows but only one of the fields is changingp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 40768 pI have a Cloud Endpoints generated library in Android Studio. The Endpoints library interacts with a Cloud SQL database that I have. p  pIn my Android application I have a MainActivity with a button. Clicking this button takes you to ActivityA. p  pHowever, I have a table in my Cloud SQL database that I want to query upon clicking this button. If that table has a certain entry, I want to launch ActivityB instead. p  pSo by default clicking the button launches ActivityA, but if something exists in the database, I want to launch ActivityB. p  pHow should I set it up so that when you click my button, the Endpoints API which is a REST API queries the database, and based on the query results either launch ActivityA or ActivityBp  pThe reason I ask is because I know you are supposed to put Restful calls into an AsyncTask to prevent the UI from getting hung up. However, AsyncTasks run in the background, so by the time it processes the query, it may be too late and ActivityA will just launch anyways. p

Negative 40768 pCurrently, within a realworld application development, I am struggling with the consumption of a custom codeUserControlcode in the MVVM pattern.p  pIn my application, there is a codeDataGridcode where the user can select an entry. The codeDataGridcodes codeSelectedItemcode is codeTwoWaycodebound to a field of the ViewModel set as codeDataContextcode. When the user selects an entry, the field is properly updated tested. In the codePagecode where holds the codeDataGridcode, the field is bound through XAML to a codeDependencyPropertycode of a custom codeUserControlcode devised in the MVVM pattern  it bares its own ViewModel which is set as codeDataContextcode.

Negative 40768 pI am working with Spring JPA and PostgreSQL. I have two classes which persisted to two database tables.  First table relates to second with a field, contains second table tuple ID and marked in java the following wayp  precodeManyToOne  JoinColumnname... NotFoundaction  NotFoundAction.IGNORE codepre  pAnd this field has in Java type of second table entity Javaclass. When first table contains in that field ID which does not exists in second table, the last annotation makes this field have null value.

How I can prevent this erasing Has JPA mechanism which allows not to save field in that situation But if field manually updated, new value should be saved.p
Negative 40768 pI have recently taken over a Woocommerce webshop built by someone else. That someone else has done an incredibly bad jobb and now I am asked to clean up the mess.p  pAfter almost two weeks of careful evaluation I came to the conclusion that the best solution is to start over on a clean install. There is a catch though the shop has already about 5000 products I tried to exportimport but I got some issues on the way like exporting product images.p  pSo, since the problems of the webshop are mainly on the WordPress itself and not on WooCommerce, I wonder if it is possible to make a clean reinstall files and DB of WordPress but keep everything that concerns WooCommercep  pI have searched a lot about this but the only stuff I find i only about keeping WordPress and reinstalling WooCommerce...

Negative 40768 pI have a test set of roughly 680 images and I am detecting one small object in the images biclass classifier. The images are large and it is possible for the object to occur multiple times in one image at different places and it needs to be detected for each occurrence. It is also possible for the object to appear at different distances. I trained a classifier using an OpenCV implementation of SVMHOG and I am using the detectMultiScale function.p  pMy question is, how does one draw precisionrecall curves There are two variables that can be adjusted in this function namely hitThreshold and groupthreshold. Should I vary for example hitThreshold and determine the precisionrecall per value of hitThreshold for the entire test set and repeat this process for different values of hitThreshold. Each iteration would then give a certain precisionrecall. Or should I just choose fixed values for these parameters, then set detectMultiScale to output the prediction certainty of each window tested, sort these values from high to low and vary a threshold to achieve the curvep  pUsually in papers, they give a curve for a particular value of a variable but never explain what was varied to achieve different precisionrecall values for the plot.p  pI am truly lost in the exact method of drawing the curve so any assistance would be greatly appreciated.p

So when all is said and done, each row in codecoordptscode variable for my vector of vectors should represent a face of the object being read in and therefore should have several sets of xyz coordinates. p  pIm working on the premise that each line in the file being read in represents a single face of a cube, teapot, whatever object.p  pI know I should push back each set of three coordinates into a temporary vector, and then push that temporary vector back into codecoordptscode, but Im having trouble accessing the elementsp  pMy code compiles when I do the above, but anytime I try to access an element Im getting errors.p  pstrongAm I missing something obviousstrongp  pI mostly just want to print out the data so that I can see if Ive read it in correctly also because Ill have to access it in other functions later on.p  h3Header fileh3  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  Definitions for standard IO routines. include ltfstreamgt include ltcmathgt     Definitions for math library. include ltcstdlibgt include ltstringgt include ltvectorgt include ltlistgt  using namespace std  class Vertex  public     Vertex      float x, y, z  float to store single coordinate.   class Object  public Vertex  public     Object      vectorltvectorltVertexgtgt coordpts  vector of x, y, z floats derived from vertex class.      vectorltVertexgt coordpts  codepre  h3Program fileh3  psupI know main isnt there, Ive included it in another file.supp  precodeinclude header.h  Include header file.
