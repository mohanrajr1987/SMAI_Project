Positive 5617 pToday we had a problem with our web application when database was updated but web application was not restarted.br After investigation we found that during db update one user defined type was dropped and created again.br Type was not changed  it was just dropped and created again using the same sql statement as it was before.  p  pFollowing code can show this problem.br There is java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException ORA00902 invalid datatype when second prepared statement is executed.  p  precodeString str  select  from MYTESTTABLE where test in select columnvalue from TABLE  tmp  OracleConnection conn  null Properties connectionProps  new Properties connectionProps.putuser, user connectionProps.putpassword, pwd  conn  OracleConnection DriverManager         .getConnectionconn, connectionProps  Statement stmt  conn.createStatement stmt.executedrop table mytesttable stmt.executecreate table MYTESTTABLE  test NUMBER22 System.out.printlnTable MYTESTTABLE was created  stmt.executedrop type mytype System.out.printlnType mytype was dropped stmt.executecreate type mytype as table of NUMBER22 System.out.printlnType mytype was created  String[] northEastRegion   10022, 02110, 07399   oracle.sql.ARRAY arr1  new oracle.sql.ARRAY         oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor.createDescriptorMYTYPE, conn,         conn, northEastRegion  PreparedStatement ps  conn.prepareStatementstr ps.setArray1, arr1 ps.executeQuery  stmt.executedrop type mytype System.out.printlnType mytype was dropped stmt.executecreate type mytype as table of NUMBER22 System.out.printlnType mytype was created  oracle.sql.ARRAY arr2  new oracle.sql.ARRAY         oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor.createDescriptorMYTYPE, conn,         conn, northEastRegion  ps  conn.prepareStatementstr ps.setArray1, arr2 ps.executeQuery java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException ORA00902 invalid datatype codepre  pWhy arr1 and arr2 are treated as different typesbr As I understand the problem is that these types have different OID.br But in java code I work with these types only by name.

Positive 5617 pI am stuck. I refuse to stay stuck for long so I am asking for help. What I am trying to do is take a ResultSet that I am retrieving from a select statement from another Database throw it into a ArrayList and then convert the array list to a insert prepared statement in Java. p  p UPDATE  The problem is that I am getting a java.sql.SQLException Parameter index out of range 6  number of parameters, which is 5. which means that it is receiving 6 parameters and not 5 and I cant see how this is happening. Since in the debugger I am watching as the values update correctly but my logic is now incorrect.p  pI ran the debugger and saw that I was just dumping all the values into the first parameter. I understand what I need to do. This is to split the ArrayList result into each parameter of the insert statement. My brain is dead. Its the end of the day and this is the last piece of my puzzle so I can move on. I just dont know how to do it.

Negative 5617 precodeltphp    My codebase is littered with the same conditionals over and over   again.  Im trying to refactor using inheritance and the Factory   pattern and Ive had some success but Im now stuck.     Im stuck because I want to derive a new class from the one   returned by the Factory.  But I cant do that, so Im obviously   doing something wrong somewhere else.        The old implementation was as follows.  Theres if statements   everywhere throughout both LayoutView and ItemIndexView and   SomeOtherView.   class LayoutView   class IndexView extends LayoutView   class SomeOtherView extends LayoutView       Below is the new implementation.  So far Ive managed to tidy   up LayoutView I think I have anyway.  But now Im stuck because   the way Ive tidied it up has left me not knowing how to extend   it.     For examples sake, lets say the conditions were relating to a   type of fish salmon or tuna.   abstract class LayoutView      protected function prepareHeader  echo METHOD, n      protected function prepareLeftHandSide  echo METHOD, n      protected function prepareFooter  echo METHOD, n      public function prepare          thisgtprepareHeader         thisgtprepareLeftHandSide         thisgtprepareFooter        class SalmonLayoutView extends LayoutView      protected function prepareLeftHandSide  echo METHOD, n    class TunaLayoutView extends LayoutView      protected function prepareLeftHandSide  echo METHOD, n      protected function prepareFooter  echo METHOD, n    class ViewFactory      public static function getLayoutViewfishType          switchthisgtfishType          case salmon             return new SalmonLayoutView             break         case tuna             return new TunaLayoutView             break                    Now LayoutView has been cleaned up and the condition that was once   scattered through every LayoutView method is now in one place.   view  ViewFactorygetLayoutView ConfiggetOptionfishtype  viewgtprepare     Now heres where Im stuck.  I want to effectively extend whatever   class view is an instance of.     The reason being, I wish to derive a view to show an index of   articles within the appropriate LayoutView.  The IndexView code is   the same for Salmon and Tuna.     I can do something like this    class SalmonIndexView extends SalmonLayoutView   class TunaIndexView extends TunaLayoutView       But then Ill be writing the same IndexView code twice.  What Id   like to do is something like this    view  ViewFactorygetLayoutView ConfiggetOptionfishtype  class IndexView extends getclassview       But Im pretty certain thats not possible, and even if it was   it seems very wrong.     Can someone more experienced in refactoring and OO please let   me know where Ive gone wrong and suggest a clean way to solve   this   codepre

The sourcepath is a seed database file installed with the application  so on first run it copies that from the CProgram Filesapp installseed.dbp  pIs there a way to set the permissions on the file when I copy it  File.SetAccessControl perhaps  I am not clear on how that works.p  pThe other issue is that the log4Net rolling file appender will not roll the old file and create a new as the old file was created by the admin user when they ran the app.p  pAny ideas  Ironically this all works perfectly fine in Vista with limitedadmin accounts  this is ONLY happening in XP with adminlimited accounts.p

Negative 5617 pI wrote a windows program many years ago, which created music by sending notes to the midi mapper and thence to the midisynth on my soundcardp  pToday, I have a softsynth which, allegedly accepts midi information, so Id assume it should be possible to use todays equivalent of a midimapper to route the midi output from my program to the softsynth.p  pTheres clearly no longer a midimapper application in windows, but my program still works on XP in that it drives the builtin soundcard synth, so there must be some sort of midi handling layer in windows. How can I get at this And maybe redirect the midi to the softsynth p

So far Ive been using a .plist that stores hundreds of strings for a puzzle game and that works great, but if my app is to be any good, its going to have to store tens of thousands of strings representing premade puzzles. p  pIve read that its a bad idea to use .plist for large files, so what is the best way to store lots of information read only for an iPhoneiPad app [Can you also point me to a solid tutorial on how to store it Many thanks in advance from a puzzled developer.]p  p[I dont need to load all the strings into my application at any one given time, only around 50 per each round of the game].p

Negative 5617 pIm currently trying to make it so that when I take a string, it fills up the first textblock until it overflows and then it should start in textblock 2. Currently, I have it to where the string is cut into two pieces at the last end of the last word before it hits what I guess to be the max characters that can fit into textblock one, and the second half is in 2, but the problem Im encountering is that its never really possible to figure out where to cut off text, since when it wraps, the spaces left over take up different sizes. So Im left with textblock 1 having some cut off text at the end, making it look like some words are missing between the two. Is there any way to programmatically find the overflow on a textblockp  pps the Textblocks are created at runtime in the C instead of the wpf markup.p  pThis is what I do. I take myDescription and try to fit it into myDesc[0] and then [2] based on the sizes I approximate. The problem is that if I guess the size threshold to be too big, it leaves myDesc[0] with a ... or cut off word, and if I approximate it to be too little, it has huge awkward gaps.

Negative 5617 h2Goalh2  pI want to create a web app with a horizontal GUI bar that floats with the user as they move from site to site. e.g. A user will sign into the web at the home page and then proceed to say Google to start searching for their topic. Once they are signed in and leave the web app homepage a horizontal GUI bar will appear on each page they visit until they log out. So when a user goes to Google to start searching the GUI bar will be there. When they click on a link and go to that page, the GUI bar will be there too. p  h2Known Waysh2  pI noticed apps like Get Glue and Layers.com work by having the user install browser extensions. I would like to avoid this if possible. p  pAdditionally it can not be like the Digg Bar because it only appears when a user presses the book marklet or places emdigg.comem in front of the sitepage URL. It also cant be like the Facebook or Meebo bars because it requires the web developer to already have implemented that code on their site. p  h2Closest Exampleh2  pThe best example of what I am trying to go after is something like Google Image search where if you click an image Google will open up the site but grayed out with the picture hovering above it and a left side bar with image info in it. So Google opens a site with in it self. Another example might be Stumble Upons top GUI bar. p  pstrongIs my idea possible with technologies like AJAX and Pythonstrongp

Negative 5617 pIt is consistently advised to override implement the codetoStringcode method of a class.p  ul liThe a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangObject.htmltoString2829 relnofollowJava API documentationa itself says It is recommended that all subclasses override this method..li liBloch, in emEffective Javaem has the item Always override toString. And only a fool contradicts Bloch, rightli ul  pI am however coming to doubt this advice is it really worth implementing codetoStringcode strongfor entity classesstrongp  hr  pIll try to lay out my reasoning.p  ol lipAn ementityem object has a unique identity it is never the same as another object, even if the two entites have equivalent attribute values. That is, for nonnull emxem, the following invariant applies for an entity class by definitionp  pcodex.equalsy  x  ycodepli lipThe codetoStringcode method returns a string that textually represents its object in the words of the Java API.pli lipA emgoodem representation captures the essentials of the object, so if two representations are different they are representaions of different nonequivalent objects, and conversely if two represenations are equivalent they are representations of equivalent objects. That suggests the following invariant for a good representation for nonnull emxem, emyemp  pcodex.toString.equalsy.toString  x.equalsycodepli lipThus for entities we expect codex.toString.equalsy.toString  x  ycode that is, each entity object should have a unique textual representation, which codetoStringcode returns. Some entity classes will have a unique name or numeric ID field, so their codetoStringcode method could return a representation that includes that name or numeric ID. But in general, the codetoStringcode method does not have access to such a field.pli lipWithout a unique field for an entity, the best that codetoStringcode can do is to include a field that is unlikely to be the same for different objects. But that is exactly the requirement of a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangSystem.htmlidentityHashCode28java.lang.Object29 relnofollowcodeSystem.identityHashCodecodea, which is what codeObject.toStringcode provides.pli lipSo codeObject.toStringcode is OK for an entity object that has no data members, but for most classes you would want to include them in the text representation, right In fact, youd want to include emallem of them if the type has a non null data member emxem, you would want to include codex.toStringcode in the representation.pli lipBut this creates a problem for data members that hold references to other entities that is, which are emassociationsem. If a codePersoncode object has a codePerson fathercode data member, the naive implementation will produce a fragment of that persons family tree, not of the codePersoncode itself. So maybe skip the data members that hold associationspli lipBut what about a value type codeMarriagecode having codePerson husbandcode and codePerson wifecode data members Those associations ought to be reported by codeMarriage.toStringcode. The simplest way to make all the codetoStringcode methods work is for codePerson.toStringcode to report only the identity fields codePerson.namecode or codeSystem.identityhashCodethiscode of the codePersoncode.pli lipSo it seems that the provided implementation of codetoStringcode is actually not too bad for entity classes. In that case, why override itpli ol  hr  pstrongEditedstrong following a replyp  pTo make it concrete, consider the following codep  precodepublic final class Person      public void marryPerson spouse           if spouse  this           throw new IlegalArgumentExceptionthis   may not marry self               more...          more...  codepre  pJust how useful would an override of codetoStringcode be when debugging an codeIlegalArgumentExceptioncode thrown by codePerson.marrycodep

My trouble is in getting the foreign key to insert into the flights table, due to the asynchronous way that BBs SQLite implementation works.p  precodedb.transactionfunctiontx       forvar i  0 i lt eventsArray.length i            var insertId  0           tx.executeSqlINSERT INTO eventid,eventName,venueName VALUES ,,,                             [null,                              eventsArray[i].eventName,                              eventsArray[i].venueName],                              functiontx,result  success callback                                  insertId  result.insertId                                  If I try inserting flights here, eventsArray[i] always returns                                  the last item in the array, the for loop has kept running                                                      If I try inserting here, I dont have the insertId            to populate the foreign key still set to 0 as the            callbacks havent fired yet  codepre  pSo it seems wherever I try to perform the insert query for the flights, Im missing a piece of data. Either the insert ID or the actual event object containing the flights I need to insert.p  pIs there a better way of doing thisp

Negative 5617 pI think Ive stumbled upon a bug in the .NET or the native windows API concerning combo boxes. p  pIll give a specific scenariop  pI have two database tables, with a one to many relation ship between the two, a brief description is as followsp  precodeTable FinSage Column     Type SageCode   nvarchar10 PK Desc       nvarchar100  Table FinCode  Column     Type  FinCode    nvarchar10 PK  Desc       nvarchar100  SageCode   nvarchar10 FK codepre  pThese are entirely user maintained, with only the PK obviously being constrained to be unique. When creating or editing a record on the FinCode table I have a combobox on the screen which has the display member bound to the Desc column and the value member bound to SageCode.p  pThe problem arises when there are duplicate entries in the Desc column, which is quite common under the expected use of the system. It seems the .net combo boxes does a reverse lookup using the display value to get the value member. So when the combo box gains focus it will change the value to the first occurrence of the display member. p  pI understand that in theory, if there are duplicates in the display value then the combo box effectively has no use as the user doesnt know which value they have selected. However as we know users are not perfect and so they will and do enter the same descriptive value for a code. p  pI currently get around this by combining the code and the description, however my boss wants them to be able to edit this value by using either the code or the description as some uses prefer to use one or the other. I tried using two combo boxes bound to the same binding source but saw this problem arise. p  pApologies for the verbose description, its not really a problem that can be summed up in code. p  pOn a slightly related note, the combo boxes that Access use dont have this bug. But I believe Access is comparable to WPF in that it draws all its own UI components rather than using the Win32 API. p  pIs there not a way of forcing a native combo box to find the correct item in the list based on the associated value or was the concept of valuedescription pair developed after Microsoft designed their native combo box p  pThank you for any insightsp  pMarlonp  pcodeeditcode br The answer below prompted me to quickly dev up a test application and Im not getting the same behaviour unless the combobox is inside a datagridview which is unrelated to the original question.p  pSorry Microsoft, I would delete this question but I cant now, ah well, mistakes are good. p

Alright, to be quite honest, I still have to delve deeper into layouts and related material. What I had tried to do here was to use Qt Designer in order to design the window. Ive done what perhaps amounts to a stupid mistake I didnt use an overall parent layout for the entire window, but hacked it with a couple of smaller layouts that I therefore have to move about and resize individually. See the Qt Designer screen the red rectangles are the sole layouts img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfLNsy.jpg altcalibrationWindow. p  pWhat is happening is that in the frame to the right, I am playing a video clip that can be of various resolutions. I want the frame to resize depending on this resolution, which also means that the buttons and window have to moveresize accordingly. That is where the window resize comes in. Im sure there is a more elegant solution than what I am doing here, but I am trying to handle several other scenarios here and hence the lack of quality of code.p  pThe result is that when I load a clip, the window attempts to resize, but does so badly the following is the result img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comU6Nq0.jpg altcalibrationWindowBp  pIf the window is dragged, it pops into its correct size in the meantime, however, it just looks ugly.p  pA couple further questions do you use the Qt Designer to design your UIs I found that programmatically you can achieve much better control of your interfaces. One thing which I could not do in the designer was to have a layout parented by the main widget, i.e. the equivalent of having the following bit of codep  precodeQVBoxLayout layout  new QVBoxLayout thisgtsetLayoutlayout codepre  pA layout placed in the designer always seems to create this layoutWidget subwidget, which the layout you placed is emthenem parented to.

Negative 5617 pIm developing a simple kinetic menu UI component for AIR for iPad. Its basically a lightweight fillin for a combobox that matches the style of iOS. I have a sprite containing any where from 2 to 60 item buttons that pops up and lets you flick scroll through them, only showing about 7 items at any given time.p  pMy first attempt at this used a mask over my sprite, moving my menu sprite up and down under the stationary mask. This produced lackluster results on the test device lt 20 fps. p  pI then tried a blitting solution, leaving the menu sprite off the display list and using BitmapData.draw to render only the part to the list i needed visible. This produced the best results on my Windows dev platform, but this time the framerate dropped below 10 fps on iPad. I am assuming I was incurring either a taxing CPU usage or a GPU readback penalty. Originally I had hoped to be able to run my app a 60 fps, however Ive ratcheted my goal down to a more humble 30 fps. p  pWhich brings me to my 3rd attempt at this UI component using the sprites .scrollRect masking function in conjunction with .cacheAsBitmap . Again, the observed behaviors differ wildly between AIR on Windows vs. iOS. On Windows it only redraws the part of the menu sprite bounded by the dimensions of the scrollRect as it should. With iOS i can touch the area of the screen above or below the visible area of the menu sprite and still drag the menu even though my finger is over empty space The performance here is decent, hovering between 19  25 fps and would almost certainly be perfect at 30 if it worked as it did on windows.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas either about the scrollRect features behavior on AIR for iOS or a better way of implementing an iOS native style gliding menu in AIR for iOS   p  pNote, the above methods were tried in both CPU and GPU mode, but CPU mode performed vastly better. I used AIR 2.7 installed on top of Flash Pro CS 5.5, with FlashDevelop as my IDE.p

Negative 5617 pIm writing an iPad app and have a problem with ui responsiveness  lock up.p  pI have a strongUITableViewstrong with items, when an item is clicked, it goes out on the internet and fetches that item and displays it. The rest of the program not shown will use the item downloaded, so only one item can be downloaded at a time.p  pFetching the item can take a long time. During that time I want the user to still be able to scroll around the UITableView, but not to be able to select anything until the previous item clicked has been downloaded.p  pI know this can be done using threads,blocks, and callbacks, but right now I dont have time to do that impossible time constraint.p  pI thought a quick way would be to download it sequentially and use run loops and a flag like this two step processp  ol lipWhen the user clicks on a table cell didSelectRowAtIndexPath is called, in there I set a global flag, then call the download method to download the item. If the user clicks on another item before the download is completed, it will see the flag checked and exit that function without downloading anything. Basically thisp  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      static BOOL alreadyInHereFALSE     if alreadyInHere return     alreadyInHereTRUE     ....     downloadItem...     ShowAndUseItem...     alreadyInHereFALSE  codepre  pThis allows the user to select only one item at a time.pli lipTo allow the user to be able to still scroll around the UITableView during the long download, I put in a run loop in the downloadItem... method shown above like this...p  precodevoid downloadItem....      BOOL downloadingTRUE     callFunctionsToStartdownload...      while downloading          downloadingDownloadSomeBytes...           CFRunLoopRunInModekCFRunLoopDefaultMode, 0.5, YES       codepreli ol  pThe result of 1 and 2 is that the user can still scroll around the UITableView during the sequential download, the alreadyInHere flag prevents them from selecting something and starting another download.p  pThis works in most cases, but around 50 of the time, during the download, the UITableView becomes unresponsive cant scroll to other items in the table, and even after the download   didSelectRowAtIndexPath is never called again when you click on something making theUITableView basically locked up.p  pMy question is, did I do the runLoop correctlyp  pI know there are other ways to do it, but I have to do it using this general method for now because of other reasons.p  pThanksp

Negative 5617 pI have a question with regards to saving data to an XML file to be opened by Microsoft Excel. I have built a report control using MFC in Visual C, and in that I have been exporting data to Excel using a simple CSV comma separated values file. The CSV method has worked well as it shows all the rows and columns in the report on Excel. p  pThe problem however comes when having to save the datatype for each column, since the CSV method disregards the datatype when exporting data as it will show all cells in string once opened in Excel. The datatype of the cells in the report is important as my client will run macros on the report data once exported  or opened  in Excel.p  pI hope to use XML to overcome this problem. Is it possible to save data type with XML since it offers formatting and schema  Can you please give me any links or any pointers that would allow a custom application to use XML to save data to be opened in Excel whilst preserving the data type p  pthanks in advance.p

Negative 5617 pI spent about a week learning and using OGLES 1.0.  I realized I needed to use 2.0 for some features that I found appealing.  I have been working on converting from 1.0 to 2.0 for a couple days now.  I have finally hit a point where I am not getting errors That I can find and have a screen rendering.  All I see is the clearcolor though.  I have tried changing things around and reading ALOT to figure out what my problem is but I just cant find the answer   So here I am asking you why all I see is the clearcolor.  Assuming my parser is correct it was working flawlessly for 1.0 my BufferObjectsarraysindices are correctthey were for 1.0 my problems is in the code I am posting.

Negative 5617 pHas anyone successfully tried minifying AND concatenating all the jqGrid locale files so that they could be loaded in one HTTP request and cached in the browser  p  pIt is a simple task to minify each file separately, but the current jqGrid i18n model requires dynamically loading the correct script file e.g. code..i18ngrid.localeXX.min.jscode based on the users locale.  This is because the resource files simply extend the .jgrid object without even knowing what their own locale is.  Including more than one in a download would simply apply the last one to be loaded and executed.p  pI would prefer to have all those static locale objects available to the clientbrowser at once, and then programmatically apply one via the grid options or perhaps via a jqGrid method.  This seems to be a more common pattern for client side localization, e.g. the jQuery UI Datepicker, Globalize fka jqueryglobal, Moment.js and others.p  pSo has anyone successfully done this, or should this be a feature requestcontribution to the jqGrid projectp

Negative 5617 pThere are some other questions on here that are similar but sufficiently different that I need to pose this as a fresh questionp  pI have created an empty class, lets call it Test. It doesnt have any properties or methods. I then iterate through a map of keyvalue pairs, dynamically creating properties named for the key and containing the value... like sop  precodedef langMap  [] langMap.putZero,0 langMap.putOne,1 langMap.putTwo,2 langMap.putThree,3 langMap.putFour,4 langMap.putFive,5 langMap.putSix,6 langMap.putSeven,7 langMap.putEight,8 langMap.putNine,9  langMap.each  key,val gt     Test.metaClass.key  val  codepre  pNow I can access these from a new method created like thisp  precodeTest.metaClass.twoPlusThree   return Two  Three  println test.twoPlusThree codepre  pWhat I would like to do though, is dynamically load a set of instructions from a String, like Two  Three, create a method on the fly to evaluate the result, and then iteratively repeat this process for however many strings containing expressions that I happen to have. p  pQuestions a First off, is there simply a better and more elegant way to do this Based on the info I have given  b Assuming this path is viable, what is the syntax to dynamically construct this closure from a string, where the string references variable names valid only within a method on this classp  pThanks p
Negative 5617 pSo. I have 4 for loops inside other for loops in JS, and my code appears FireBug agrees with me that my code is syntactically sound, and yet it refuses to work. Im attempting to calculate the key length in a vigenere cipher through the use of the Index of Coincidence, and Kappa tests lt if that helps any.p  pMy main problem is that the task seems to be too computationally intensive for Javascript to run, as Firefox shoots up past 1GB of memory usage, and 99 CPU when I attempt to run the keylengthfinder function. Any ideas of how to solve this problem, even if it takes much longer to calculate, would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 5617 pim starting to explore a brand new world for me that is the world of the games. Ive started using the cocos2d framework to get the interface done. The brain of the game is a c class that is called when in the interface happens something. As this brain should keep track of everything and keep track on what happened in the game, i think that the correct design pattern is the singleton one. Now my question is  does anyone have experience in creating singletons in c and add those to an iphone app  Obviously ive googled for a day and read a lot of docs but the informations ive got are not very clear  Links are welcome  thanks p
Negative 5617 pThere are codencode object which perform some actions. After performing an action a timestamp will be updated. Now I want to implement a timeoutthread which verifies if a timestamp is older than for example 60 seconds. p  pMy first solution was to do that with a thread whileloop  sleep which is holding a list with all objects including the last timestamp.

Negative 5617 pI am trying to do some GPGPU using OpenGL ES 2.0.br It seems to me that the GLNVdrawbuffers and the a hrefhttpwww.khronos.orgregistryglesextensionsOESOEStexturefloat.txtGLOEStexturefloata extensions are some of the essentials here.brbr This question relates to the a hrefhttpwww.khronos.orgregistryglesextensionsOESOEStexturefloat.txtGLOEStexturefloata extension From the desktop world Im used to textures being in the [0..1] range when accessed in the shader if the format is fixed point like GLRGBA.brConsulting the respective OES extension page, it saysbrbr  ... If the internal format of the texture is fixedpoint, components are clamped to [0..1]. Otherwise, values are not modified.p  pNow Ive heard several times on the web for example the answer here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9398889doopenglglslsamplersalwaysreturnfloatsfrom00to10Do OpenGL GLSL samplers always return floats from 0.0 to 1.0a that ES 2.0 supports access to unclamped values in the fragment shader, too. But where is this functionality specified The extension says otherwise, values are not modified but since the OpenGL ES specification only knows fixedpoint formats it doesnt make sense to me.p  pAlso, as I understand it, the extension only specifies that float values can be read from client memory into a texture but does not specify how i.e. how many bits per channel the texture is represented in graphics memory. Is there any official spec on thisp  pFinally Id like to write unclamped floating point values to an FBO color attachment in my fragment shader, preferably using 32 bits per channel. Is this possiblep
Negative 5617 pIve got an NginxGunicornDjango server deployed on a Centos 6 machine with only the SSL port 443 visible to the outside world. So unless the server is called with the codehttpscode, you wont get any response. If you call it with an codehttpdomain443code, youll merely get a 400 Bad Request message. Port 443 is the only way to hit the server.p  pIm using Nginx to serve my static files CSS, etc. and all other requests are handled by Gunicorn, which is running Django at codehttplocalhost8000code. So, navigating to codehttpsdomain.comcode works just fine, as do links within the admin site, but when I submit a form in the Django admin, the https is lost on the redirect and Im sent to codehttpdomain.comcoderequesturi which fails to reach the server. The POST action does work properly even so and the database is updated.p  pMy configuration file is listed below. The location codelocation code section is where I feel like the solution should be found. But it doesnt seem like the codeproxysetheader Xcode directives have any effect. Am I missing a module or something Im running nginx1.0.15. p  pEverything I can find on the internet points to the codeXForwardedProtocol httpscode like it should do something, but I get no change. Im also unable to get the debugging working on the remote server, though my next step may have to be compiling locally with debugging enabled to get some more clues.

Negative 5617 pI have a Domain that I generate using Entity Developer. This creates all of my Entities and my Database tables. I use NHibernate to populate my Entities which are exposed via Repositories. I then have a services layer that aggregates the Repositories into useful services. This layer is used in two ways. One, I use services as my only means of communication to and from my web layer and I want to someday use the services for WCF. Right now, Im working on my web layer and Im trying to figure out the best way to communicate with my services. My services are currently returning Entities. My web layer is grabbing these Entities via the services in the controllers. This is probably not very DRYDDD. Im assuming my services layer needs to interface via DTOs. DTOs would be perfect for my WCF services. As for my Web layer, Im assuming that I would take the DTOs that are returned from my services layer and I would want to map those to View Models Im using ASP.NET MVC 3.p  pSo this is what my architecture would end up looking likep  precodeDomain   Entities   Repository Interfaces Infrastructure   NHibernate   Concrete Repositories Services   DTOs   Concrete Services   Service Interfaces   IIS hosted WCF Website   ViewModels codepre  pAnd I would either use Automapper or ValueInjecter to do my mappings probably ValueInjector due to the ability to flatten and unflatten my EntitiesDTOs.p  pSo is this overkill The system Im using this architecture is quite large Im rewritting everything. Am I doing it right Everything is decoupled dependencywise with Ninject because I could see wanting to change out any part of the system at any time. Any thoughts, ideas or criticism is very welcome and appreciated.p

Negative 5617 pWe have an ASP.NET 1.1 application installed on server A and SQL Server 2000 on server B. We want to migrate our database from SQL Server 2000 to SQL Server 2008. p  pThe issue is we dont have the code for ASP application as it was developed by some third party development company which does not exist any more. So the only thing we are left with is precompiled code and DLLs. I disassembled the DLL files with PE explorer to figure out that the ADODB connection is made using DSNs. We upgraded SQL Server 2000 to SQL Server 2008 on server B and installed SQL Server native client driver in server A so that our application can use that ODBC driver to connect to SQL Server 2008. I reconfigured DSN with the new ODBC driver and the ASP application still does not work. It is not able to connect to database. p  pAdditional Information we have an application pool for the ASP.NET application in IIS and I restarted the COM component but no luck.

Negative 5617 pA common goal of software design seems to be to structure an application so that changes impact a minimal amount of components i.e compiled assemblies which can then be published individually.

Is this the case And is it the case if theyre across multiple files So if I write with ODIRECT  ODSYNC to A, then ODIRECT  ODSYNC to B, am I guaranteed that, no matter what happens, if the data is in B its also in Ap  pDoes fsync even guarantee that the datas written a hrefhttplwn.netArticles270891Thisa says not, but I dont know if things have changed since then.p  pDoes the journalling of ext4 completely solve the issue of corrupt blocks that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma9706180750875this SO answera says existp  pIm currently growing files by calling posixfallocate and then ftruncate. Are both of these necessary, and are they enough I figured that ftruncate would actually initialise the allocated blocks to avoid a hrefhttpsext4.wiki.kernel.orgindex.phpClarifyingDirectIO27sSemanticsWritesintopreallocatedspacethese issuesa.p  pTo add confusion to the mix, Im running this on EC2, I dont know if that affects anything.

Negative 5617 pIve created a navigation bar where an admin can add and remove links with a simple form. When the form is submitted to add a link, an AJAX call is made to add the new information into the mySQL database. As part of the callback function, the navigation bar is updated to include the new link using the following line of codep  precode.nav ul.loadgetnav.php codepre  pThe  file getnav.php is as followsp  precodeltphp   requireconnect.php   query  SELECT id, title, url             FROM nav             ORDER BY position ASC   result  mysqligtqueryquery    while data  resultgtfetchassoc          if emptySESSION[valid]            echo   ltdiv classcontainergtltbutton typebutton name.data[id]. classdelButton altDeletegtltbuttongtltdivgt    echo   lta href.data[url]. alt.data[title].gt.data[title].ltagt   gt codepre  pThe issue is that when the nav bar is updated in the AJAX call, only the links are being shown, and the delete buttons disappear. codeSESSION[valid]code is set, so the code right after the if SHOULD be executed. However, its that ifs code that is missing after the AJAX call is made. The only explanation I have for this is that when getnav.php is being loaded into code.nav ulcode, the session isnt being accessed. Anyone know why that isp
Negative 5617 pAn codeAuthorcode has multiple codeBookscode, both of which are codeNSManagedObjectscode modeled as a onetomany relationship using Core Data. 20 of the time I just need to know how many books an author has written, so I check codeauthor.bookscode.p  p40 of the time I need this data by order of date published, and 40 of the time I need it ordered by title. Multiple classes will want to access these ordered lists.p  pstrongQuestion 1strongp  pIs it reasonable to add two additional methods to codeAuthor  NSManagedObjectcode Since I need to request them from multiple places, it seems smarter than sorting the NSSet each time in the class making the request. I.ep  precodeproperty NSSet books core data generated  just returns the unordered set  NSArray booksByDate applies an NSSortDescriptor to self.books, returns an NSArray  NSArray booksByTitle applies an NSSortDescriptor to self.books, returns an NSArray codepre  pstrongQuestion 2strongp  pUsing the codeNSSortDescriptorcode has proven expensive, with an impact on UI performance. Ideally, I would like to try using the newish codeNSOrderedSetcode to model the relationship as ordered, to see if there is a performance benefit. But I cant really pick which way to order the relationship, since whichever I choose by date or by title will be nonoptimal 40amp of the time. Not to mention that I may want to add more sorted variants later.p  pIs there some way I can have the best of both worlds, and store the relationship 3 times in my Core Data model Once for the unordered relationship codeNSSetcode, and once each for the ordered relationships codeNSOrderedSetcode. I would only consider this if keeping all three properties in line with each other could be automatic  perhaps by tweaking how the codeNSManagedObjectcode adddeletesupdates its Books. For example, I would like to somehow customize codeauthor.addBookcode to also insert the same book in the correct location into codeauthor.booksByDatecode and codeauthor.booksByTitlecode. And probably hide the p  pIs something like this possible Advised Remember, my main goal is to speed up retrieval of the ordered lists  I am willing to sacrifice write times for insertsupdatesdeletes.p

Negative 5617 pI am trying to get the most recent NWS radar images using c. There are a hrefhttpradar.weather.govridgeRadarImgNCROKXCMOD relnofollowdirectoriesa on the NWS website that contain a list of the most recent images. However, the files are named by the date uploaded, not in numerical order. They are generally uploaded every few minutes, but the exact amount of minutes can vary by as much as 5 minutes. To get the URLs of the images, I could write an XML parser to extract the URLs from the index page, however this seems over complicated for such a simple task. In addition, this index page is not an API, and if they might change something with the format that would screw up the XML parser. Is there some other way to get the URLs of the most recent imagesp

Trace logs dont show jack and for some reason the same error would not occur on my local machine, only on the server. The Server Trace logs wouldnt even show the client call when I would receive this error. Like the call never made it to the WCF Service from the Client.... On top of that, the Clients trace log didnt show anything besides a strongSystem.Threading.ThreadPoolWaitCallback.PerformWaitCallbackObjectstrong erroring, which didnt help.p  pIve tried everything online as possible solutions or possible ways to provide a more meaningful trace but without luck. Anyone else run into this, without a Trace log that helpsp

Negative 5617 pI have a Java webservice running on Tomcat in our internal environment. Lets say the wsdl is p  precodehttpactual8080apptempwsdl codepre  pTo provide access to this webservice from outside the network, we created a proxy using Apache on another server and used ProxyPass to do something likep  precodeProxyPass apptemp httpactual8080apptemp codepre  pSo externally when we access proxyapptemp over http, it gets diverted to actual8080apptemp just fine. So no issues with that, and I can also access the wsdl. p  pBut the WSDL has references to actual server for the webservice location on the port. This causes failure when an actual call is made to the webservice methods from a client.p  pAny ideas on how this can be fixed, please Thanks.p  pNote The client is generated using Metro. I found a way to force a different endpoint in the client using a code like below. But I am looking more for a pure proxy solution that we can do, instead of developers using our webservice having to touch their code. p  precodeBindingProviderport.getRequestContext.putBindingProvider.ENDPOINTADDRESSPROPERTY, httpproxyapptempwsdl codepre

Negative 5617 pI am defining a multiquine asp  blockquote   pA set of emnem programs in emnem different programming languages, such that each one of them, when given no input, outputs its exact source code, and when given emnem as input, output the source code of the nth program.p blockquote  pThis is not to be confused with a circular sequence of programs, where each program outputs the source code of the next, until the first program has been outputted. In this instance, each program is not a quine, which defeats the point. These cyclic sets, while being interesting brainteasers for high values of emnem, are quite trivial to implement.p  pComplex, in this instance, means for values of emnem greater than emor equal toem 2. I believe that a solution for coden  2code is complex enough in this instance. However, a general solution read strategy for all values of emnem is the target.p  pI understand how simple quines are written, however I cannot seem to get my head around complex multiquines, which fascinate me. A part of me hopes that there is no solution except for shear ingenuity in the mind of the programmer  although I see this as unlikely.p

Negative 5617 pI apologize in advance, this one is hard to explain.p  pI have a GridView full of tiles that are selectable. When a selection is made, the bottom AppBar appears by setting IsOpen and IsSticky to true.

I end up touching the screen twice to perform a second selection.p  pIn the start screen of Windows 8, you can select multiple tiles one after another seamlessly.

Negative 5617 pIm adding a logging system to a .Net ASMX WebService which is running as a windows service. The aim is to log each call to a WebMethod under a different request id to be able to identify in the logs all the entries made for a particular request.p  pTo set the scene a little more, each WebMethod creates HttpWebRequests to communicate with other hosts.p  pIn the first attempts at solving the problem I made use of storing the request id per thread using the followingp  ul lipstrong[ThreadStatic] static int requestIdstrongpli lipstrongThread.GetDatastrong and strongThread.SetDatastrong to store the request id per thread.pli ul  pHowever I soon realised that the requests were swapping threads and this was not reliable.p  pI lastly attempted to use strongHttpContext.Current.Itemsstrong to store the request id per WebMethod request, however this wasnt entirely reliable as HttpContext.Current.Items could be empty at times.p  pInvestigating further I believe this could be due to the sending of HttpWebRequests within the WebMethod, my reason for thinking this is due to async calls occuring within the HttpWebRequest which may lose the original HttpContext and therefore its items.p

Negative 5617 pI have many tables that have TextID column which refers to the translation table. Translation table needs also LanguageID to get translated text in desired language.

Negative 5617 pI have an abstract super class that implements an interfacep  precodepublic abstract class FooMatrix implements Matrix      public Vector multiplyVector vec           Code for Matrix  Vector        public interface Matrix      public Vector multiplyVector vec  codepre  pand then I have a subclass that extends the super class and implements a second interface that  represents a mathematical subclass of the mathematical class represented by the first interfacep  precodepublic interface Vector       Methods   public class FooVector extends FooMatrix implements Vector      Override     public Matrix multiplyVector rightVec           Code for Vector  Vector       codepre  pSo the subclass is returning a super class of the return type of the abstract super class. This isnt working, and I want to know how I can make it work.p  pIn mathematics, vectors are a subclass of matrices. A matrix times a matrix yields another matrix, in general. If the second matrix is a vector, the result is a vector. If both matrices are vectors, the result is a matrix or a scalar for column vector times row vector or row vector times column vector, respectively. This assumes the dimensions are compatible.p  pI would like to represent this behaviour with Java classes in a way that respects mathematics and gives the most specific return types possible. In other words, I want codefooMatrix.multiplyVector veccode to return codeVectorcode, and not just codeMatrixcode, but I want codefooVector.multiplyVector rightVeccode to return codeMatrixcode and not codeVectorcode which would be incorrect. I can deal with a scalar as a 1x1 codeMatrixcode with another codeVectorcode method codeinnercode that calls codemultiplyVector rightVeccode and then returns the single element of the 1x1 return codeMatrixcode as a scalar.p  pI have found questions regarding covariant return types, but nothing like this.p  pThanksp
Negative 5617 pRecently I did some web design work for a person. I continued to show him progress by giving him a link to his new site on my development server. Nearing the end of completion, he dropped all contact with me and I was completely unable to get a hold of him. I took a look at his site recently, and he mixed a combination of his old site, with the new one I was creating. I thought maybe he redesigned it himself after looking at my version, however a quick look at his source code shows that the parts I recognized were full out just copied by viewing the source code on my dev server. So he completely stiffed me and I received no payment from him.p  pJust wondering if theres anyway to prevent that in the futurep  pMy first thought was obfuscation, but a quick search shows that doing that to html is not recommended and not foolproof anyway.p  pObviously this is a lesson learned for me to get some sort of up front payment first, but being able to prevent work from being so easily stolen in the future would be nice.p  pAre there any developers that have come across similar issues How do you show someone the progress of your work without giving them plain as day access to your sourcep

Negative 5617 pWhat are the practical differences between using modules with use statement or isolated files with include statement I mean, if I have a subroutine that is used a lot throughout a program when or why should I put it inside a module or just write it in a separate file and include it in every other part of the program where it needs to be usedp  pAlso, would it be good practice to write all subroutines intended to go in a module in separate files and use include inside the module Specially if the code in the subroutines is long, so as to keep the code better organized that way all subroutines are packed in the mod, but if I have to edit one I dont need to go though a maze of code.p

Negative 5617 pI just started Windows Phone app development and my app is making a fair amount of money via advertisements through PubCenter. I really like Microsofts Dev Center app for Windows Phone but they dont have an app that allows you to check your advertisement statistics. I wanted to initially make one for personal use then, if polished enough, publish one. The problem is Ive never done anything like this. Is it even possible I looked at the source on the reports page and see where I could extract todays and this months earnings, but I dont know where Id start regarding authentication. Could someone please point me in the right direction or shut me down if it isnt possiblep  pHeres the link in question  a hrefhttpspubcenter.microsoft.com relnofollowhttpspubcenter.microsoft.comap

Negative 5617 pIm designing a set of mathematical functions and implementing them in both CPU and GPU with CUDA versions.p  pSome of these functions are based upon lookup tables. Most of the tables take 4KB, some of them a bit more. The functions based upon lookup tables take an input, pick one or two entry of the lookup table and then compute the result by interpolating or applying similar techniques.p  pMy question is now where should I save these lookup tables A CUDA device has many places for storing values global memory, constant memory, texture memory,.... Provided that every table could be read concurrently by many threads and that the input values, and therefore the lookup indices, can be completely uncorrelated among the threads of every warp resulting in uncorrelated memory accesses, which memory provides the fastest accessp  pI add that the contents of these tables are precomputed and completely constant.p  pEDITp  pJust to clarify I need to store about 10 different 4KB lookup tables. Anyway it would be great to know wether the solution as for this case would be the same for the case with e.g. 100 4KB tables or with e.g. 10 16KB lookup tables.p

Negative 5617 pIm new to OpenGL, and one of the operations I want to do is write pixels directly to to screen not using vertices and polygons. I have investigated a variety of answers to similar questions, the most notable ones a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10040961openglpixelperfect2ddrawingherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6644248pixelartwithopenclopenglhereap  pI see a couple ways drawing pixels to the screen might be possible, but they both seem to be indirect and use unnecessary floating point operationsp  ol lipDraw a codeGLPOINTcode for each pixel on the screen. Ive tried this and it works, but this seems like an inefficient way to draw pixels onto the screen. Why write my data in floatingpoints when its going to be transformed into an array of pixel data.pli lipCreate a 2d quad that spans the entire screen and write a texture to it. Like the first options, this seems to be a roundabout way of putting pixels on the screen. The texture would still have to go through rasterization before getting put on the screen. Also textures must be square, and most screens are not square, so Id have to handle that problem.pli ol  pSo heres my final question. How do I get, a matrix of colors, where codepixels[0][0]code corresponds to the upper left corner and codepixels[1920][1080]code corresponds to the bottom right, onto the screen in the most direct and efficient way possible using OpenGL Writing directly to the framebuffer seems like the most promising choice, but I have only seen people using the framebuffer for shading.p

Negative 5617 pI have a datagrid that contains some columnsbr strongCategoryID, SubcategoryID, SubcategoryName emInvisible, Invisible, Visibleemstrongp  pWhen creating new subcategory, CategoryID is reqired. p  pI am inputing a new subcategory name from UI.

Data Adapter raises an error, saying that CategoryID cannot be null. From what I have tested this is caused by the new row containing some invisible trash.

Negative 5617 pI am using the Laravel framework and was reading through Laravel Testing Decoded by Jeffrey Way.  It goes into depth on how to test and why to test, and talks about testing anything and everything.p  pMy question is this strongemIf I am performing most of my tests on my model, do I need to test my controllers in depth as wellemstrongp  pFor instance, my model tests validation, it tests saving, hashing passwords, miscellaneous functions... all which can be called by the controller.  My controller just receives the request, calls the model methods, and then serves up the view.p  pThe section on controller testing shows that you can test the controller for validation, redirects, model saving, etc.  It seems like a lot of this is repetitious, and there should be no need to test validation and saving if I have tests that do that already on the model level.p

Negative 5617 pI wanted to know how I can gain access to the sectionsInserted slot.I need access to the parameters of that method.

Negative 5617 pDont know if this is the right place to write but I ran into some problems with Eclipse and Android SDK.p  pI installed some updates in Eclipse through HelpCheck for updates, including the Android plugin or what its called.p  pSo after the installation I restarted the eclipse and now everything is gone I cant create new Android projects, cant run existing ones.p  pI taught that maybe I will just install this plugin again, but when I copy the google url for the plugin in software window it shows Error  Duplicate location.p  pIts like everything is gone. When I want to create new project, I even cant create new Java project I have only these kind of options as shown in picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkoGMZ.jpg altenter image description herep  pCan anyone tell me how to fix thisp
Negative 5617 pIm using a poorly developed app that keeps restarting because of memory leaks or other random errors that do not repeat if restarted. I do not have access to the code and cant fix it.p  pIve developed a c app that manages restarts and keeps the program running if it just stops, but how do I identify a hang or when it crashed but a windows error message keeps it running.p  pI could use codeSystem.Diagnosticscode to detect if CPU time delta is 0 in 60 seconds time as the process is usually at 2530s, 50cpu usage, but this can cause unwanted restarts when the process idles for resources as it has a queryintensive step that can last between 10min and 2hours.p  pSo how can I detect if program is waiting for mssql query or network resources, andor how can I detect and implement something like this  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa373347.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa373347.aspxap  phere is

Negative 5617 pI have multiple tiny Linux emembedded serversem on Beaglebone Black could by a RaspberryPi, it makes no difference that need to exchange information with a emmain serverem hosted on the web. p  pIdeally, each system talks to each other by simple RESTful commands  for instance, the main server sends out new configurations to the embedded servers  and the servers send back data. Commands could be also issued by a human user from the main server or directly to the embedded servers.p  pstrongWhat would it be the most standard way of authentication of each server against each otherstrong Im thinking OAuth, assuming that each machine has its own OAuth user  but Im not sure if that is the correct pattern to follow.p

Negative 5617 pSo, Im investigating MySQL deadlock exceptions on our RailsUnicornNginx app. What Ive found is that sometimes, well see a storm of requests that get a 499 status code from one client. From a hrefhttpforum.nginx.orgread.php2,213789,213793msg213793 relnofollowthis posta, it looks like nginx returns 499 when the client closes the connection unexpectedly or, um, something. Im not quite clear on whether the client actually sees the status code or not I cant replicate this locally.p  pFrom the nginx logs, it looks like in these requests, we wind up writing 0 bytes to the client. In my Rails logs, theres nothing remarkable about the requests theyre finishing in normal amounts of time 40120 ms and returning a 302 redirect.p  pSo, whatever, right But What makes this bad is that the client appears to be interpreting whatever its seeing or not seeing as an invitation to try its request again. Even if its a POST. And my Rails app is happily handling those requests and creating duplicate entries in the database. Sometimes it creates quite a lot of records  in one case, we had a client repeat a request some 6500 times over about ten minutes. Thats... suboptimal.p  pIm trying to figure out what to do. What Id really like is to fix whatever interaction Im seeing with nginx, but Im not sure how  if the client is closing the connection before it gets data, I cant control what its gonna do.p  pAn alternative which feels like a horrible hack is to do something like include a unique key say, from a a hrefhttpwww.microshell.comdatabasemysqlemulatingnextvalfunctiontogetsequenceinmysql relnofollowsequencea in a hidden form and have a unique index on the corresponding database column. But there are millions of rows on this table so screwing around with its schema is not something I want to do lightly.p  pIn case it matters, the requests are being done via HTTPS. It looks like it comes most commonly from a small subset of our clients.p  pHas anyone else seen this other than a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9914115whatcouldcauseduplicaterecordstobecreatedbyrails99151409915140this posta Am I totally mad Can anyone think of an elegant solutionp

Negative 5617 pUsing Asp.Net Identity 1.0 RTM version. The default implementation creates an AspNetUsers table.

Negative 5617 pIm working on a simple application that hooks into Wirecast, a streaming software, and forces it to change it source every X seconds. I thought that this would be a good way for me to learn ASP MVC 4, but Im not very familiar with it and have run into some problems. Id like the user to be able to enable and disable the loop by selecting a radio button and hitting Apply, or something similar. Starting the loop works fine, but Im unable to end it. The way  Im trying to do this is to create a thread that runs the loop and start the thread when the user selects the Enable Loop radio button, and abort the thread when they select Disable Loop. I can see that the Abort method is getting called, but the thread is still running. The relevant code is belowp  precodepublic Thread loop  new Threadnew ThreadStartThreadLoop  [HttpPost] public ActionResult LoopModels.Loop model       if model.doLoop  true              loop.Start          else              loop.Abort           return View   public static void ThreadLoop      object oWirecast  GetWirecast     object oDocument  Late.InvokeoWirecast, DocumentByIndex, 1     object oNormalLayer  Late.InvokeoDocument, LayerByName, normal     shotCount  intLate.InvokeoNormalLayer, ShotCount     int shot  0      while true              shot  shot  1         if shot gt shotCount                      shot  shot  shotCount                  int shotid  intLate.InvokeoNormalLayer, ShotIDByIndex, shot         Late.SetoNormalLayer, ActiveShotID, shotid         Late.InvokeoNormalLayer, Go         Thread.Sleep3000       codepre  pSo, if you see any problems with this, or can point me in the right direction, Id love your help.

Negative 5617 h2Questionh2  pI want to know if you can specify a step size in a numeric range.p  pFor example, exist something like code50..100 in 10code that resolve to code[50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]codep  por if not exist can I make something like code5..10  10code and the same resultp  hr  h2Explanationh2  pHere an explanation about my problem if you like to know more. I have a configuration file with two blocks, the second related with the first.p  pSomething likep  p   p  pThis will configure the application to do first A with parameter 100 and then do B with parameter 200.

Negative 5617 pIm writing a maintenance script in PHP. The script keeps about 100,000 keyvalue pairs in an associative array and compare a bunch of other data with that array.p  pThe keys are 12 or 16byte hexademical strings.p  pThe values are arrays containing 110 strings. Each string is around 50 bytes.p  pIm populating my array by reading a text file linebyline with codefgetscode in a loop.p  pstrongAll is fine until I hit about 44,000 keys, but after that the memory usage suddenly skyrockets.strongp  pNo matter how much I increase the memory limit and Im relunctant to give it any more than 256MB at the moment, the memory usage increases exponentially until it hits the new limit. This is weirdp  pThe following is a table with the number of keys on the left and the memory usage on the right.p  precode10000     6668460 20000    12697828 30000    18917768 40000    25045068 41000    25658148 42000    26760304 43000    27350368 44000    27920400 45000    33438520 46000    77800344 47000   114203960 48000   161989660 49000   168419992 50000   206265572 Fatal error Allowed memory size of 268435456 bytes exhausted codepre  pAs you can see, the memory usage is consistent at strong620660 bytes per keystrong until I reach 44,000 keys. After that, memory usage suddenly begins to increase, until it reaches strongover 4KB per keystrong at 50,000 keys. This is very strange because the size of my keys and values are always similar.p  pstrongIt seems like Im hitting some sort of internal limit on the number of keys I can have in an array, beyond which it all becomes very inefficient.strongp  pIf I can maintain a memory usage of 620600 bytes per key which sounds reasonable given the usual overhead of using an array, my entire dataset should fit in approx. 64MB of memory and therefore easily accessible when I need to reference it later in the same script. This was the assumption when I first started writing the script. Its a maintenance script run from the CLI, so its OK to use 64MB of memory from time to time.p  pBut if the memory usage keeps increasing like the above, Ill have no choice but to offload the keyvalue dataset to an external daemon like Memcached, Redis, or an SQL database, and the network overhead will greatly slow down the maintenance script.p  pstrongWhat I tried so farstrongp  ul liI tried flattening the twodimensional array into multiple onedimensional array. No luck.li liI tried splitting the large array into multiple smaller arrays. No luck.li liI tried not using arrays at all and turning every key into a separate variable.

Negative 5617 pI am developing an app that contains a web view. A certain times during the app it does a call to Webview loadUrl.p  pSometimes the call will come directly from an event on the UI thread and other times it comes from an event on a background worker thread. When it originates from the background thread I do a call to runOnUIThead to ensure the actual call to loadURL happens on the UI thread.p  pWhat I am experiencing is that loadUrl works fine when originating from the UI thread, however it fails to work when it comes from a worker thread even though the actual call to loadUrl happens via a runnable I pass into runOnUIThread.p  pHaving set a break point I can see that in both instances loadUrl is being called on the UI thread. Yet it works in one case but not the other.p  pI am currently sifting through the Android Webview source code to see if I can track down why sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. If anyone can shed any light on the matter it would be greatly appreciated. p  p UPDATE p  pI have tried a few suggestions from this post here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14279335webviewloadurlworksonlyoncerq1WebView loadUrl works only onceap  pMainly doing the following before calling loadUrlp  precodewebView.clearCachetrue webView.loadUrlUrl codepre  pAndp  precodewebView.clearCachetrue webView.clearView webView.reload webView.loadUrlaboutblank webView.loadUrlUrl codepre  pUnfortunately neither of them work.p

Negative 5617 pI am working with jQuery.Gantt and am attempting to add in my own snap to functionality to the bars in the chart. p  pMy original idea was to make each cellday within the chart .resizable, and use the resizable extension for jQuery UI to make these elements snappable, which should then allow the bars to snap to the cells.p  pHowever, the cellsdays were just a repeated background image within one large element, as opposed to individual HTML elements themselves as I had thought. p  pMy new idea is to compare the length of a resized bar on the chart against numerical values. For example, one cell  24px, if the new width is 24 and lt36 as that is the cell size plus half a cell then set the width of the element back to 24, creating the appearance of snapping backwards. To snap forwards I check the new width 36 and lt48 then set the width of the element to 48 the size of two cells.p  pI have done the code for 3 cells worth of size, as you can see belowp  precodevar onecell  24 var startwidth var endwidth      .selector.resizable              handles e, w     ,              stop functionevent, ui                    endwidth  this.width             ifendwidth lt onecell                            this.widthonecell Checks current size vs minimum size, if is less than or equal to one cell size, set to one cell size                        else ifendwidth gt onecell ampamp endwidth lt 36                            this.widthonecell                        else ifendwidth gt 36 ampamp endwidth lt 48                            this.width48                        else ifendwidth gt 48 ampamp endwidth lt 60                            this.width48                        else ifendwidth gt 60 ampamp endwidth lt 72                            this.width72                     codepre  pThe issue I face is that there are many cells and if I do the function this way,  it will require many lines of code and will not be efficient.p  pWould anyone be able to help me improve this or point me in the right direction p  pI was thinking there might be a way to use the modulus operator and rounding one way or the other to create the desired effect.p

But I see that when using some of ObjectiveC features that uses Blocks as Arguments in Methods, some variables are assignable, even if they are not declared with this codeblockcode statement.p  pHere are 2 codes for examplep  precode[UIView animateWithDuration2 animations                self.animatedView.backgroundColor  [UIColor blueColor]          self.animatedView.center  CGPointMake100, 100      ] codepre  panimatedView is a simple UIView connected with an IBOutlet.p  precode    int myInt  10     NSMutableString mString  [NSMutableString stringWithStringMutable Hello]     NSString imString  Imutable Hello      void myBlockvoid                [mString appendString Block] working         imString  Imutable Hello Block error         myInt  11 error      codepre  pMy question is strongHow come I can assign values to the UIView instance propertiesstrongp  pIm not addressing an Object and changing it, like my mString.p  pI would expect the center property to behave like my myInt, as its a C struct accessed directly, and not a pointer to an object.p  pI would expect backgroundColor to behave like my imString, as its a pointer to an object which is assigned with a new object, isnt itp  pI couldnt find a satisfying explanation in the documentation... I would appreciate if anyone can provide one, or address me to one. p

Negative 5617 pI am trying to set the text color using css in a jinja2 template.  In the following code  I want to set the output string to print in a specific font color if the variable contains a string.  Everytime the template is generated though it prints in red due to the else statement, it never see the first two conditions even though the output should be matched, I can tell what the output from the variable is when the table generates and it is as expected.  I know my css is correct due to the printing of the string in red by default.p  pMy first thought was to enclose the string I was checking for in quotes but that didnt work.  Next was that jinja was not expanding codeRepoOutput[RepoName.indexrepo]code but the for loop above it works, codeRepoNamecode is expanded upon properly.  I know if I add the braces it will print the variable which I am fairly certain will either break the template or just not work.p  pI tried looking at these sites and went through the list of global expressions as well but couldnt find any examples similar to mine or a direction in which to look further.p  pa hrefhttpjinja.pocoo.orgdocstemplatesif relnofollowhttpjinja.pocoo.orgdocstemplatesifap  pa hrefhttpwsgiarea.pocoo.orgjinjadocsconditions.html relnofollowhttpwsgiarea.pocoo.orgjinjadocsconditions.htmlap  precode for repo in RepoName             lttrgt              lttdgt lta hrefhttpmongit201.be.monster.comicinga repo gt repo ltagt lttdgt         if error in RepoOutput[RepoName.indexrepo]               lttd iderrorgt  RepoOutput[RepoName.indexrepo]  lttdgt lt I want this in green if it is uptodate, otherwise I want it in red gt          elif Already in RepoOutput[RepoName.indexrepo               lttd idgoodgt  RepoOutput[RepoName.indexrepo]  lttdgt lt I want this in green if it is uptodate, otherwise I want it in red gt           else              lttd iderrorgt  RepoOutput[RepoName.indexrepo]  lttdgt lt I want this in green if it is uptodate, otherwise I want it in red gt            lttrgt        endif        endfor  codepre  pThanksp

Negative 5617 pI want to implement a CSRF prevention mechanism for my application by setting a cookie and sending an HTTP header with the same value with every POST  PUT  DELETE request. Everywhere I read, the best practices suggest that the csrf cookie should be set from the server. Im building a single page app using AngularJS and they also suggest that for security reasons the cookie should be send by the server on the first GET request.p  pMy question is  why should the server send the cookie and not just set it on the client using simple javascript and a generated random uuid valuep  pAlso, if you have a public app that can be accessed by everyone and still need to protect it from csrf, how would the server side remember what token it sends to what user, if they do not have session cookiesp

Negative 5617 pIn Word VBA, I have built a tool that uses the Word InsertCrossReference function to automatically insert a link into a Word document, e.g., the function can create a link to section strong2.1.5strong.p  pThe link worked and everything seemed to be fine.  But when used under industrial conditions, it was found that when a writer changed the document structure by, for example, adding a section, so that for example, section 2.1.5 becomes section 2.1.6, then the F9 Refresh function did not change the link to strong2.1.6strong. It stayed as 2.1.5.p  pSo after investigating the problem, I found that the problem was that the strongInsertCrossReferencestrong function created an absolute link instead of a relative link.p  pOn examining the internals of the link   by doing a ShiftF9  I saw that the link looked as followsp  p REF Ref378698314 n h p  pwhich is apparently an absolute link.p  pSo I tried changing the n to r to change the field to  p  p REF Ref378698314 r h p  pThat worked When I then applied ShiftF9 to the field,  the value of the field became strong2.1.6strong, which is what it is now supposed to be. p  pSo...

Negative 5617 pThe Setup  I have a code base that includes a few PCLs one of those PCL is a group of data access classes that call out to my WCF Data service.  Ive leveraged the Task.Factory.FromAsync to manage the beginExecuteendExecute of calling out to the WCF Data service.  I then await for the results and send the data to the application.  I started out by first creating a Win Store app and everything worked great.  Now Im in the process of creating a win phone 8 UI.  Now Im running into a snag.  The snag seems to be an exception on the line that awaits the task created by the Task.Factory.FromAsync method.  To further complicate matters the exception does not happen if I install and run the application for the first time.  The second time I open the application the error is thrown.  So Im really confused as to why the second run causes the error since all of the same logic is being followed.  The exception I get isnt from anything in my code but seems to be from the .NET library itself.  Ive tried a few other things to try to solve this mysterious issue.  I created a Task.Delay task and that line has no problem, but when I call await on its task I get the exact same error.  I tried to just get the Task.Result instead of awaiting it and the result is never returned so the application just hangs and an exception was never thrown either.p  pI didnt run into any issues in my WinRT application so Im guessing all of my logic is sound and there shouldnt be any odd threading issues, etc.p  pThe Exceptionp  pA first chance exception of type System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException occurred in mscorlib.ni.dll When I get this exception I also get a tab in visual studio that says Source Code Not Available.

Its really frustrating as I was hoping all the hard work was done with the WinRT app and now all I need to do was create a quick simple UI on the windows phone 8.

Negative 5617 pI am looking to preprocess timestamps to obtain the corresponding weeknumbers using mapreduce as the dataset has hundreds of millions of instances that need to be processed. I have so far figured out that the first MR job needs to preprocess and sort each line according to timestamp as the key and the rest of the line as value. p  pThe second job then appends the corresponding date to each timestamp object. p  pI however do not know how to perform the third task I need to accomplish which is to create a continuous timeline of weeknumbers .Meaning, if my minimum timestamp corresponds to the date 03102000 I would like to tag this with a number 10 indicating that this is the 10th week of the year 2000  lets assume it is if its not in this case.. Then lets say I have the next timestamp corresponding to 02012011, if we assume 52 weeks in the year 2000 and that 02012011 is the 5th week in 2011, I would like to tag this date as week 57 and not as week 5. I would like to know how to achieve this last step in mapreduce. Assuming I have the following input filep  precodesortedtimestamp1datevals.... sortedtimestamp2datevals... ... ... ... sortedtimestampndatevals..... codepre  pSimple pseudocode with map and reduce in java would suffice for my case, actual code would be great also.p  pThanks in advance for your helpp

Negative 5617 pI have an eclipse workspace for work that has an ear project that I use to exportdeploy an ear file to a JBoss server. p  pHowever, they recently asked me to create an ant script that can build the workspace and create the ear, and I have done this successfully. The problem arises when I try to run my program with this ear that was built using the ant script for deploying Im simply copying the resulting ear file and pasting it into the JBossstandalonedeployments folder and running the application. p  pThe JBoss AS starts fine, but then I get a few exceptions that halt my application that I do not get when I do a build and deploy through eclipse. The two ear files are identical when viewing the two ear files using 7zip, however I see in the eclipse workspace, in the ear project, theres a .settings folder that has 4 files, one of them being org.eclipse.wst.common.component and Im guessing this if not all 4 files is necessary when deploying somehow.p  pDoes ecplise use this .settings folder and the files inside when deploying an ear What happens during this process and how can I replicate it in an ant script so that my application runs identically from either ant or eclipse buildsp  pstrongemEDITemstrongp  plet me just add that none of the files in the .settings folder get packaged up in the ear file, so Im guessing theyre somehow used when eclipse does a builddeploy, but it doesnt get placed in the final ear productp  pthank youp

Negative 5617 pI am again asking a question on this progressbar project although this should just be a clarification question.p  pMy code causes for a progressbar to be created to track the creation of a file. The user selects the type of file they want to create and then hits go which causes for the file to begin changing and for the progressbar to appear. Progressbar works great. File writingmanipulation works great. p  pProblem When the user selects several files to manipulate, despite the progressbars being created correctly, they do NOT update correctly.

Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.            If the persistent store is not accessible, there is typically something wrong with the file path. Often, a file URL is pointing into the applications resources directory instead of a writeable directory.

If, however, the URI is   of the form a hrefftpcontoso.compath relnofollowftpcontoso.compatha, first the .NET Framework logs   into the FTP server using the user name and password set by the   Credentials property, then the current directory is set to   path.p blockquote  pWhich is how the AS400 is expecting the data to come through.p

Negative 5617 pI am trying to allow access to certain resources such as JS, CSS, etc. while silently redirecting everything else to index.php which will eventually decide whether the remainder of the content exists or not. This is to allow friendly URLs without everything i.e. static files going through PHP.p  pI am testing the code in the publichtmltest directory but some .htaccess directives need test while other dont. When I have it working to my satisfaction I will move it to the publichtml directory but I dont want to have to edit the file to get it working in the new location. What Im saying is that I want the file to work the same way regardless of the location and without having to hardcode the full path in so I can move it to a server with a different structure.p  pI have the following .htaccess file in codehttplocalhosttestcodep  precodeOptions Indexes  RewriteEngine On RewriteBase    Specifically deny includes RewriteRule includes  [R404,L]   Allow images, css amp js but deny everything else, e.g. lib RewriteCond REQUESTURI testimages RewriteCond REQUESTURI testcss RewriteCond REQUESTURI testjs RewriteRule .  [R404,L] codepre  pIm going to change the last rule to rewrite to index.php later instead of giving a 404. For the moment I just want to get the .htaccess file working a bit nicer.p  pHow can I make the rules consistent i.e. remove codetestcode from each codeRewriteCondcode I would like to be able to test it in the test directory but then move it to the web root directory i.e. inside publichtml or even one lower without changing the paths. I have tried changing codeRewriteBasecode but I dont understand exactly what it does and I havent seen any difference with other values.p  pHow can I make this .htaccess file work if I move it down to the same level as publichtmlp  pIdeally Id like the following structurep  precodepublichtml publichtmltest publichtmltestcss publichtmltestimages publichtmltestincludes publichtmltestjs publichtmltestlib publichtmltestindex.php publichtml.htaccess codepre  pwhere everything still works if I move it top  precodepublichtml publichtmlcss publichtmlimages publichtmlincludes publichtmljs publichtmllib publichtmlindex.php .htaccess codepre

Negative 5617 pI require developing a .NET 4.5 Client for a SOAP based web service. The problem is the company who are developing these SOAP based services do not provide WSDLs.

Negative 5617 pLead wanted simpler code reviews PRs. So branched code into 3 branches. ABC. Then deleting code from A. Deleting the additional code so A will be a simpler code review. Then will make a code review for B, and later C.p  pSince B is branched from A, then I assume I can never do a pull on it. Is this correct Similar but not the same question  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20450537howtoturnagitbranchintoforkHow to turn a git branch into forkap  pI guess what I should have done is using original code base ABC done thisp  precodeABCgtA  delete B and C stuff. Code review A. ABCgtBCgtB  delete C stuff and code review B BCgtC code review the total. Or ABCgtC even. codepre  pThis way changes to ABC could be pulled into A, or B, or C. Correctp  pSo, given I didnt do that, is there any way to save my code on a Pull or Merge. That is, if I dont Pull into B but do merge B into the EPIC, then will the deletes done in A be applied not what I want. Or perhaps if I touch every file deleted in A while working on B and C will that save my files and prevent them being deleted on Merge. Afraid I might get burned here.

I have two tabs The Create tab opens a container that allows you to insert paragraphs, the Home tab opens another container containing a Select paragraph button.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pIt wont update the values of the array when I do it for the second time. I.e., if I switch between the tabs and go on select mode again to selectdeselect, it will not update the new selection, instead I get the same selection from the first time.p  pIve created an example so you can look at it and if there is a better way to accomplish this which I know there is then be my guest. Link is below the next paragraph.p  pstrongInstructionsstrongp  pIn order to select a paragraph, first you need to add a paragraph which is created on the fly, then you switch to Home section, click on the Select paragraph button, this takes you to the Create section on select mode. To selectdeselect, click on any paragraph. When you select a paragraph, it stores its position using jQuery  index in the storeClass array. Once youre done selecting paragraphs then you exit the select mode by clicking Ok button and it switches to Home section, but lets say you want to create another paragraph then you click on Create tab, create the paragraph, switch to Home tab, go on select mode and select again and switch between tabs and you will see just the first selection you made on the first time.p  pHere is the same example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net7mbhnvas8 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net7mbhnvas8ap  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltul classtabgt ltligtlta classparagraphtabgtCreateltagtltligt ltligtlta classselecttabgtHomeltagtltligt ltulgt ltdiv classwrapgt     ltdiv classcreateparacontgt            lth3gtCreate a paragraphlth3gt         ltul classpararesultsgt             ltulgt                    ltdiv classparatoolgt             ltpgtlttextarea classtextareagtlttextareagtltpgt             ltbutton typebutton classcreateparabuttongtCreate paragraphltbuttongt             ltdivgt                 ltbutton typebutton classselectokbuttongtOKltbuttongt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classselectparacontgt         lth3gtSelect Modelth3gt         ltpgtltbutton typebutton classselectparabuttongtSelect paragraphltbuttongtltpgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  codepre  pstrongjQuerystrongp  precodeul.tab li afirst.addClasstabactive .createparacont.addClasscontactive  .createparabutton.onclick, function .createparacont.addClasscontactive    var parent  .pararesults var child  ltligtltligt var p  ltpgtltpgt var textarea  .textarea.val  if.createparacont.hasClasscontactive           p.texttextarea        child.appendp        parent.appendchild            else      return false      var storeClass  [] .selectparabutton.onclick, function .createparacont.addClasscontselect if.pararesults li.length gt 1      .textarea, .createparabutton.hide     .selectparacont.hide     .selecttab.removeClasstabactive     .createparacont.show     .paragraphtab.addClasstabactive      .selectokbutton.show      for  var i  0 i lt storeClass.length i  i  1               .pararesults.eachfunction index                this .find lieq storeClass[ i ]  .addClasspselected                            ul.tab li.onclick,a, function    ifthis.hasClassparagraphtab     .pararesults.childrenli.removeClasspselected     .selectparacont.hide     .selecttab.removeClasstabactive     .createparacont.show     .paragraphtab.addClasstabactive  else      .createparacont.removeClasscontactive     .createparacont.hide            .paragraphtab.removeClasstabactive     .selectparacont.show     .selecttab.addClasstabactive   ul.pararesults.onclick,li, function  if.createparacont.hasClasscontselect       this.toggleClasspselected      var selected  .pselected               var pSelected  selected.parent.children.indexthis     storeClass.push pSelected             else       return false       .selectokbutton.onclick, function if.createparacont.hasClasscontselect     .createparacont.removeClasscontselect     .createparacont.removeClasscontactive     .createparacont.hide            .paragraphtab.removeClasstabactive     .selectparacont.show     .selecttab.addClasstabactive      codepre

Negative 5617 pI am performing a custom traversal in Neo4J, using my own evaluator. In the traversal are two nodes, connected by two different relationships. What Im seeing is that only one of the two relationships will be walked during the traversal.p  pHowever, my custom evaluation changes its behavior based on whether both relationships are present.p  pIt seems like during a traversal, Neo4J maintains a set of visited nodes, and if a candidate path ends at a node that has already been visited, then that path is never sent to my evaluator. Is there a way around this How can I have a custom evaluator examine every possible path to the nodesp  pHeres a quick examplep  pSay that the graph looks like thisp  precode             EDABC codepre  pThe traversal begins at A. A has two different relationships tying it to B of two different types. All of the remaining nodes are connected by only 1 relationship. The goal of the evaluator is to return AD, AB, and BC, but not DE. The determination that BC is valid comes from the fact that there are two relationships between A and B.p  pHow can this be solvedp

I do not however understand the terms on which a CPU will do thisp  pCPU2 may wish to load a value which has been written in to CPU1s store buffer. As I understand it, the problem is CPU2 cannot see the new value in CPU1s store buffer.

Negative 5617 pIve figured out the answer to this, but thought Id post the question and the answer since it took me quite a while to figure it out.p  pI had been using the Google Drive iOSObjective C API see a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdriveiosquickstart relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comdriveiosquickstarta in my app for some time. And all was going fine. In the last few days I was trying to extend my use of it, and in my new use, as part of what I was doing, I wanted the Google API access to occur in the background, and not hold up the UI. So, I dispatched the call to the Google API like thisp  precode        dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYLOW, 0,               Call Google Drive          codepre  pThe results were mixed. I was getting partial results. Seemingly, it would work until I relaunched my app, and then it would stop. Despite the fact I still had the user authorization credentials.p

Negative 5617 pI find that in some cases, there is a lot of code in a constructor, or a class has two or more constructors which have comparable code. In these cases, I often create a private method. In the former case to improve readability, in the latter to prevent duplicate code.p  pIn some of these cases this results in a private method that should ONLY be called from the constructor for whatever reason. Is there a way to enforce this I could imagine doing something like thisp  precodeusing System.Diagnostics  public class Foo    private bool constructing  true    private Foo        constructing  false       public Foostring someString  this         constructorspecific code     Initialize       public Foodouble someDouble  this         constructorspecific code     Initialize       private void Initialize        Debug.Assertconstructing, Initialize method should only be called from constructor       shared code     codepre  pbut this feels somewhat clunky. Does anyone have a better suggestionp  pEdit added constructor chaining to example I meant for this to be in the original example.p  pEdit I think I missed a point in my original question  while chaining constructors does provide a solution in some cases, the chained code is always executed prior to the code in the constructor that youre chaining from which, incidentally, is why the above example doesnt work. There are cases where you want to execute some part of shared code, and then do something else. Ill add another example to reflect thisp  precodeusing System.Diagnostics  public class Foo    private bool constructing  true    public Foostring someString         constructorspecific preprocessing code     Initialize      constructorspecific postprocessing code      constructing  false       public Foodouble someDouble         constructorspecific preprocessing code     Initialize      constructorspecific postprocessing code      constructing  false       private void Initialize        Debug.Assertconstructing, Initialize method should only be called from constructor       shared code     codepre
Negative 5617 pIm working on a Android APP. Theres a main activity and a service.

Negative 5617 pI am currently developing an SPA application using AngularJS which allows endusers to add amp edit orders via a form.p  pWhat I would like to know is what is considered the best practice for determining whether the application is in an codeEditcode or codeCreatecode statep  pFor example, when I click on a menu item that says Add New Order I would expect a partial view called order.html displayed with all entry fields blank.  If its possible, I would also like is to reuse this same view when editing an order with the entry fields prefilled from the current order being edited.p  pDo I need to use a codeservicefactorycode for this that has a property to determine state, for examplep  precodeangular.moduleapp     .factoryorderService, [http, functionhttp          var state               addOrder false,             order                  orderRef ,                 orderDate                            ] codepre  pThen I could set the codeaddOrdercode property from the relevant controller according to the edit state, as well as filling out the codeordercode property with the details of the order when codeaddOrder truecode.p  pI have looked around the net, unfortunately such examples of this appear to be scarce.p

Negative 5617 pI need to make an inventory db and I came up with the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHp7dQ.jpg altenter image description herep  pBoth STRUCTUREs and CONTAINERs PKs are also FKs to PLACEs PK. PLACE also has a PARENTID column so I can put a container inside a container and inside a structure.p  pSo an INVITEM can be stored either in a structure or a container, and a container can be placed in another container and in a structure with the recursive relationship.p  pThe same with EQUIPMENT. I can store it either in a structure by itself or in a container.p  pThe problem is that I could also store a piece of equipment, a container or an inventory item in an equipment thats not designated as a container. For example, a car and a wrench are both EQUIPMENT, and a wrench can be stored in a car or in a container inside a car. How do I solve thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong br More details br STRUCTURE a building with various uses. Can be a warehouse, a plant, a shed etc. br CONTAINER a more specific location used for storage that resides in a structure. Can be a physical item like a bin or a pallet, but also just a location, like drawer 3. If its a physical item that has the sole purpose of storing things, its a container, not equipment. br EQUIPMENT tools used by the company. A car, a wrench, a forklift. Not for sale. Can be stored either in a structure OR a container. Has a serial column to uniquely identify it. br INVITEM A product, anything that the company routinely buys or sells. Stock. For example shirts, candlesticks, sunglasses, screws. It also includes fuel for companys equipment. Can be stored either in a structure OR a container. Has a quantity on hand column. br PLACE base table that solves the exclusive arc problem between STRUCTURE and CONTAINER and allows us to put a container in a structure.p

Negative 5617 pI was wondering why people dont use uppercase in name of header files. I see many header files with name only in lowercase. But I thought it would be more easy to read if they write them with uppercase, say BaseClass.h, SubClass.h, instead of baseballs.h, subclass.h. Why is that Or its just that the header files Ive seen are named only in lowercasep

Negative 5617 pGood day. I am building an Android Application where Im aiming to scan a form using OpenCV for Android. I am planning to use the same concept that QR Codes use, the alignment squares, in order to make sure that Ill make the scan properly every time. p  pI know I can just use the ZXing Library, however, I am not using a QR Code. Im only borrowing the alignment square idea before I run my image processing on it.p  pI found a hrefhttpdsynflo.blogspot.com201410opencvqrcodedetectionandextraction.html relnofollowthis bloga wherein he uses the OpenCV C Library to find the alignment squares and then he realigns the image and outputs a realigned QR Code. a hrefhttpsgithub.combharathp666opencvqrblobmastervideo.cpp relnofollowHis C Code can be found in his github here.a I dont have much background about C aside from the classes I took back in college and I havent had experience in using OpenCV in C.

Negative 5617 pIve spent quite some time trying to figure out how to use auto layout and size classes to create a grid 4x4 of equal sized buttons with fixed margins that expand to fit the size of the target device. The problem is that the widths will be different on every device with a different width which is more than the compactanyregular provided by size classes. p  pHas anyone done this so that widths are based on a calc such as this where N is the number of buttonsp  pbutton width  device frame width  N  1  margin  Np  pThe alternative is to do the layout in code which I know I can do with minimal code. At this point, it seems like if I can actually get auto layout to sort of work, it will be at the price of a very fragile configuration that will need pages and pages of documentation so I can figure it out again a year from now.p

Negative 5617 pIm reading through Paulsons emML For the Working Programmerem and am a bit confused about the distinction between datatypes and structures.p  pOn p. 142, he defines a type for binary trees as followsp  precodedatatype a tree  Lf      Br of a  a tree  a tree codepre  pThis seems to be a recursive definition where a denotes some fixed type.  So any time I see a, it must refer to the same type throughout.p  pOn p. 148, he discusses a structure for binary treesp  p...we have been following an imaginary ML session in which we typed in the tree functions one at a time.  Now we ought to collect the most important of those functions into a structure, called emTreeem.  We really must do so, because one of our functions emsizeem clashes with a builtin function.  One reason for using structures is to prevent such name clashes.p  pWe shall, however, leave the datatype declaration of emtreeem outside of the structure.  If it were inside, we should be forced to refer to the constructors by emTree.Lfem and emTree.Brem, which would make our patters unreadable.  Thus, in the sequel, imagine that we have made the following declarationsp  precodedatatype a tree  Lf      Br of a  a tree  a tree  structure Tree       struct     fun size Lf  0          size Br v, t1, t2  1  size t1  size t2     fun depth...     etc...     end codepre  pIm a little confused.p  p1 What is the relationship between a datatype and a structurep  p2 What is the role of struct within the structure definitionp  p3 Later on, Paulson discusses a structure for dictionaries as binary search trees.  He does the followingp  precodestructure Dict  DICTIONARY       struct      type key  string     type a t  key  a tree     val empty  Lf      lta bunch of functions for dictionariesgt codepre  pThis makes me think struct specifies the different primitive or compound types involved int he definition of a Dict.  p  pThats a really fuzzy definition though.

Negative 5617 pI am trying to use OpenCV to estimate one pose of a camera relative to another, using SIFT feature tracking, FLANN matching and subsequent calculations of the fundamental and essential matrix.

The rotation matrices when converted to Euler angles give wrong results in both the cases. This happens with a lot of other datasets as well. I have tried switching the fundamental matrix computation technique between RANSAC, LMEDS etc., and am now doing it with RANSAC and a second computation using only the inliers with the 8 point method. Changing the feature detection method does not help either. The epipolar lines seem to be proper, and the fundamental matrix satisfies x.F.x  0p  pAm I missing something fundamentally wrong here Given the program understands the epipolar geometry properly, what could possibly be happening that results in a completely wrong pose I am doing the check to make sure points lie in front of both cameras.

Negative 5617 pConsider the followingp  precodeclass base        base class  public     void doBaseStuff           do something basic       private     int someDataMember   class derived  public base        this class inherits doBaseStuff as well as someDataMember  public     void doDerivedStuff           do something in addition that only this type of derived class can do         class specialDerived  public base        say doBaseStuff doesnt make sense in the context of this class      we do not want to inherit that function here      is there a way to prevent instances of this class from calling it      we still want someDataMember, so we must derive from the base class  public     void doSpecialStuff           do something in addition that only this special derived class can do        codepre  pTheres a class that serves as a common base class for multiple other classes. But lets say one of the base class member functions it NOT wanted in one of the derived classes. Is there a way to explicitly ban an inherited function in a derived classp  pRealisticly we could be talking about a base class that has a 1000 members, and we want to inherit 999 of them, so simply abandoning inheritance and just duplicating all the code will result in very bad code maintainability.p  pMaking that function in the base class virtual, and providing a dummy implementation of it in the codespecialDerivedcode class would work. But what if that function has an actual return type, instead of codevoidcode The codespecialDerivedcode class would then have to provide an implementation that returns something. The caller then could assume that the value they got is something meaningful, when its really not, and thats a problem.p  pSimply implementing the virtual function in codespecialDerivedcode with a single codethrowcode in the body could be a solution, as long as some documentation exists that explicitly states that calling this function on objects of this specific derived type has no meaning, and that this operation will throw. I think this is one possible solution, but Im not sure if its the best way to go.p

Negative 5617 pWith grails 2.5, is it possible to write tests unit and integration in java and have them executed by the grails test runner grails testappp  pIll provide a little background on our situation.  If we had a brand new app, wed just write our tests as spock tests in groovy, and everything would be fine.  However, we have a large application that started out years ago as a Spring MVC application written in java.  We ported it to grails 2.1 about 3 years ago.  When we ported it into grails, parts of it were converted to groovygrails, but much of it remained in java, including a lot of test code.  Since grails uses Spring MVC under the covers, we were able to get it to work without too much effort.   With grails 2.1, the grails test runner grails testapp does run our java tests for us without problems they are all JUnit 4 tests.  However, we are now upgrading to grails 2.5, and we we run grails testapp with grails 2.5, only the groovy tests are executedthe java tests are all now ignored.  Does anyone know how to get grails to execute java tests in grails 2.5p  pHere is an example integration test that runs under grails 2.1 but is just ignored with grails 2.5p  precodepackage com.finch.google.adwords.updaters  import com.finch.domain.client.Client import com.finch.testing.DomainCreatorUtil import com.finch.testing.TestProfile import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired import org.springframework.test.annotation.IfProfileValue import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.AbstractJUnit4SpringContextTests  import static org.junit.Assert.assertFalse import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue   IfProfileValuenameTestProfile.INTEGRATIONWS, valueTestProfile.RUN ContextConfigurationlocationsconfigapplicationContext.xml,configdbLocalPoolContext.xml,configtestContext.xml public class AccountUpdaterTest extends AbstractJUnit4SpringContextTests       Autowired     private DomainCreatorUtil mDcu      Autowired     private AccountUpdater mAccountUpdater      public void testDataPartitions          Client client  mDcu.addNewTestClient         assertFalsemAccountUpdater.confirmPartitionsclient         mAccountUpdater.createPartitionsclient         assertTruemAccountUpdater.confirmPartitionsclient         mAccountUpdater.dropPartitionsclient         assertFalsemAccountUpdater.confirmPartitionsclient       codepre  pThis test is located under the testintegration directory of the grails project the standard place for grails tests.  We know that we cant leverage a lot of the nice testing functionality that grails provides with this sort of test, but these are legacy junit tests just testing java code, so thats finewe just want them to run when we execute grails testapp like they did under grails 2.1.p

Negative 5617 pWe are using Protractor 1.3.1 and most of the teams complaint when they run tests on Saucelabs grid. Because the same set of tests works fine on local grid all the times. Upon debugging what I noticed on the Saucelabs grid is that it sometimes resolves protractor promises fine but sometime it doesnt. For resolution we have to stop relying on protractor promises which makes our jasmineprotractor code ugly and of course extra efforts.p  pAs I described the failures happens after any promise related events like click, sendKeys, customWaitFunction, etc.p  pI wonder if its older version of protractor or there is some network latency that is causing those failures Any suggestion to improve test success rate is highly appreciated. p  pNotes  Almost all the apps are nonangular applications.  Contacted Saucelabs people and they dont see any issue rendering the app suggesting to resolves the issue in script.p

Negative 5617 pI am developing an app using Electron and node.js. I know how to connect it to a MySQL database, but I need it to work even if the device is offline, so I have to clone the database somehow locally when the app starts and every 30 minutes.  I need some advice about how I can clone a MySQL database what packages should I use. The main database is hosted on a webserver and the app will be run on many devices about 10.p
