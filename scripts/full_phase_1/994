Positive 994 pIm writing a emSwiftem command line tool that uses codeNSTaskcode to interact with codegitcode. In the simplest scenario I want to run three commands codeinitcode, codeadd .code, and codecommit m Initial Commitcode. I intend to use a separate codeNSTaskcode for each command, and want to house each command in its own function  returning codetruecode if the task succeeded or codefalsecode if it didnt. This setup would allow my codemaincode function to look like thisp  precodefunc main       if runInit          if runStage              if runCommit                   NSLogsuccess                             codepre  pTo accomplish this each of the three functions must do the following before returning i launch the task ii wait for it to complete, iii obtain whatever is in codestdoutcode, and iv set the return value codetruecode or codefalsecode.

Positive 994 pI have implemented an NSSplitView which essentially keeps a table on the left of the window like a sidebar, and a webView on the right. The user clicks the different rows of the table to load a url in the WebView.p  pMy issue is that when I run the app, the divider moves to the right edge of the width of the left view and the window size does not increase to accomodate the webView. At first I thought the webView was just not working, until I discovered I was able to drag the divider to the left which revealed the webView.p  pIts my understanding that the auto layout constraints setup within the view itself is how the split view resizes, however I create the webView programatically via a subclassed view controller rather than on a storyboard or xib. As a test, I tried placing a button and applying width constraints but it had no affect, the webView is still hidden, essentially with a width of 0 points and is only able to be revealed by dragging the split view divider to the left.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions how I can go about resolving this issuep  pThanks in advancep

Positive 994 pWhen I create models in core data, Im always a little perplexed by which integer type I should choose16, 32, 64.  Im almost always needing something for a simple, basic number a count of people in the household, for my present case. Probably going to be a number between 120.  Or, I have an incrementing case id number in another instance...cant imagine that going further than  few hundred people.  p  pAnd heres the deal...Its clear that true computer science folk think of numbers differently, taking into account factors like the architecture thats going to be processing the numbers, the space required to process and store the data, backwards compatibility, future proofing, etc.  When I think of numbers, I basically think of how large a value is being represented.  So when I get to that point of my process when I have to choose between three types of integers, I basically say to myself, Well, this is going to be a small number, lets just use the Int 16 option..., or Shoot, I could end up with a really big number here so lets use the Int 64 choice.  Basically, I pick these data types with the same sort of logic I use when ordering fries...if Im really hungry I go for the large, if Im feeling a big guilty Ill just get the small.  p  pIm learning enough to know that Im not thinking about this in the right terms, but I dont really know why, and I dont know the appropriate way to choose the best option.  What factors should I really be considering...whats the most important criteria for selecting between Int 16, Int 32, and Int 64p

Negative 994 pAt work we have two competing theories for salts.  The products I work on use something like a user name or phone number to salt the hash.  Essentially something that is different for each user but is readily available to us.  The other product randomly generates a salt for each user and changes each time the user changes the password.  The salt is then encrypted in the database.p  pMy question is if the second approach is really necessary  I can understand from a purely theoretical perspective that it is more secure than the first approach, but what about from a practicality point of view.  Right now to authenticate a user, the salt must be unencrypted and applied to the login information.  p  pAfter thinking about it, I just dont see a real security gain from this approach.  Changing the salt from account to account, still makes it extremely difficult for someone to attempt to brute force the hashing algorithm even if the attacker was aware of how to quickly determine what it was for each account.  This is going on the assumption that the  passwords are sufficiently strong.  Obviously finding the correct hash for a set of passwords where they are all two digits is significantly easier than finding the correct hash of passwords which are 8 digits.  Am I incorrect in my logic, or is there something that I am missingp  pstrongEDITstrong Okay so heres the reason why I think its really moot to encrypt the salt.  lemme know if Im on the right track.  p  pFor the following explanation, well assume that the passwords are always 8 characters and the salt is 5 and all passwords are comprised of lowercase letters it just makes the math easier.p  pHaving a different salt for each entry means that I cant use the same rainbow table actually technically I could if I had one of sufficient size, but lets ignore that for the moment.  This is the real key to the salt from what I understand, because to crack every account I have to reinvent the wheel so to speak for each one.  Now if I know how to apply the correct salt to a password to generate the hash, Id do it because a salt really just extends the lengthcomplexity of the hashed phrase.  So I would be cutting the number of possible combinations I would need to generate to know I have the password  salt from 1326 to 826 because I know what the salt is.  Now that makes it easier, but still really hard.  p  pSo onto encrypting the salt.  If I know the salt is encrypted, I wouldnt try and decrypt assuming I know it has a sufficient level of encryption it first.  I would ignore it.  Instead of trying to figure out how to decrypt it, going back to the previous example I would just generate a larger rainbow table containing all keys for the 1326.  Not knowing the salt would definitely slow me down, but I dont think it would add the monumental task of trying to crack the salt encryption first.  Thats why I dont think its worth it.

Negative 994 pWinForms has given way to WPF and new models such as MVVM, that better enable Test Driven Development, work very nicely with WPF.  Also, it seems to me that ASP.NET is very closely aligned with the WinForms way of doing things, for example event handlers in the codebehind which is linked using inheritance or partial classes.  With WPF and MVVM, this mechanism falls out of favor and Data Binding is used to further decouple the user interface to the point where it is just a skin.p  pSo, I would bet that Microsoft is building something like a WPFinspired, XAMLbased replacement for ASP.NET.  That is, HTML page views that are written in XAML so that they can take advantage of binding, but when run will render standardsbased HTML.  However, I cant find any reference online.  There is a a hrefhttpaspnetmvvm.codeplex.com relnofollowASP.NET MVVM article at CodePlexa, but the binding there seems pretty manual.p  pThis is not intended as a community wiki question, I really do want to know what Microsoft is working on.  However, Im guessing that I cant stop the speculation Ive already done some.p  pEdit Quite a few responses pointing to Silverlight have come through.  I should have been more explicit.

Because some of the nodes fall into that range I want to display that entry. But if I was given a range of 1115 none of the nodes fit so I wouldnt want it displayed.p  pThe problem is... I have absolutely no idea how you would do this. I know you can IF a single value but I cant think of a simple way to test each node.p  pBy the way, this is all being done inside the latest stable release of the Symphony CMS.p  p[edit] The problem with the first two results is they display the ITEM nodes, what Im looking for is to return only ENTRY nodes that have at least one ITEM node that matches.

Negative 994 pHow do computer games render their ground I will be using a heightmap for geometry though I will later optimize it but I am wondering what the best technique is, for example, to paint my ground grass most everywhere, dirt paths here and there, gravel inside towns, and smooth transitions between each type of material.p  pDo I just use a huge prebaked texture That seems very inefficient, when I could tile existing textures. So then do I use a huge alpha map for each existing texture In theory it sounds okay to me but how do I actually go about doing that and what are the consequences I really dont know where to start, and my Google searches arent proving very effective.p  pId rather not have to snap the texture to the grid i.e. space 0,0 is grass, space 0,2 is dirt, space 0,1 is grassdirt transition Id rather be able to arbitrarily paint so that it looks more convincing.

Im using OpenGL so if you can provide tips as far as OpenGLs way of doing things, and functions that I may never have heard of, that would be great.p  pJust for clarification, Oblivion is a good reference as to what Im looking for.

Negative 994 pI want to send emails through a web app, for example, reminders of a tasks manager, reminders of birthdays... I want to program a date and an hour, and get the email sent at that moment.p  pI think I have two options to do this using cron or sending email with a future timestamp.p  pUsing cron involve to run a command which will query the database each one, two o five minutes to check if there are any email to be sent. Or, another way, when I save a new reminder, put a new crontab task via execute a system command from the web app at the time indicated. With the first option, I think the server load will be excessive. With second option, Ill have hundreds of crontab tasks, what looks dirty for me.p  pPerhaps I could send the email at the very moment of creating the reminder, but changing the email timestamp to a date and hour in the future. I know some email servers can manage this like Mercur for Windows, but, is it a standard I will use my Gmail account to do this job. And, with this solution, I wont be able to cancel a reminder, because the email has been sent at the moment I created the reminder.p  pI can use PHP or Ruby RoR for server language, so the language isnt important, because both of them can send emails and call system commands. If the solution entails scripting, I can use bash scripts, Perl, Python... the server is a Linux box.p  pWhich do you think is the best method to accomplish the solution to this problemp  pI apologize for my poor english.

Negative 994 pSQL Server 2008 database design problem. p  pIm defining the architecture for a service where site users would manage a large volume of data on multiple websites that they own 100MB average, 1GB maximum per site. I am considering whether to split the databases up such that the core site management tables users, payments, contact details, login details, products etc are held in one database, and the database relating to the customers own websites is held in a separate database.p  pI am seeing a possible gain in that I can distribute the hardware architecture to provide more meat to the heavy lifting done in the websites database leaving the site management database in a more appropriate area. But Im also conscious of losing the ability to directly relate the sites to the customers through a Foreign key as far as I know this cant be done cross database. p  pSo, the question is two fold  in general terms should data in this sort of scenario be split out into multiple databases, or should it all be held in a single databasep  pIf it is split into multiple, is there a recommended way to protect the integrity and security of the system at the database layer to ensure that there is a strong relationship between the twop  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 994 pI put together a quick WinFormembedded IE browser control which logs into our companys bank website each morning and scrapesexports the desired deposit information the bank is a smallish regional bank.  Since we have a few dozen pseudoaccounts that draw from the same master account, this actually takes 1015 minutes to retrieve.  p  pAnyway, the only problem is that our business bank account reuires an RSA security token httpwww.rsa.comnode.aspxid1156if you are not familiar, it is a small device which shows a random 6 digit number every 15 seconds, so I have to prompt for this value before starting.  This is on top of the websites login based security model, so even if you create a readonly account that cant do anything, you still have to put the RSA number in.  We have 5 of these tokens for different people in the company.  p  pFrom our perspective this is nusiance security.  I was joking about using a web camera to OCR the digits from the key fob so they didnt have to type it in  mainly so that the scrapingexport would be done before anyone arrives in the morning.  Well, they asked if I could really do it.p  pSo now I ask you, how hard how many hours do you think it would take to OCR these digits reliably from a JPEG image produced by the camera  I already know I can get the JPEG easily.  I think you get 3 tries to log in, so it really needs to hit a 99 accuracy rate.  I could work on this on my off time, but they dont want me to put more than a few hours into it, so I want to leverage as much existing code as possible.  This is a 7segment display like an alarm clock so its not exactly text that an OCR package would be used to seeing.  p  pAlsothere is a countdown timer on the side of the display typically when it is down to 1 bar, you wait until the next number appears and it starts over at 5 bars like signal strength on your cell phone.  So this would need to be OCRd as well but it is not text.p  pAnyway the more I think about it as I type this, the less convinced I am that I can truly get this right, so maybe I should just work on it in my spare timep

Negative 994 pWe have a WPF application that has a print preview dialog.  When we create the PDF to match this print preview dialog, we want the PDF to show a 100 match.  For instance, we have a WPF TextBlock with a set height and width and some content that wraps in the text block.  We then want to recreate this text exactly in the PDF.  So far we have tried a PDF component and we have found that for the most part this looks correct, but wrapping will not always match 100.  For example, where the print preview WPF TextBlock shows 7 words on a line, the PDF created with the PDF component may only show 6 with the seventh on the next line. p  pIs it possible to get a 100 match between our WPF TextBlocks and the PDF textblock  Or is this a limitation in going from the WPF textblock to the PDF textblock which any component will never be able to overcome  We really want the print preview to show a perfect match to what will be delivered to our customers in the PDF.p

Negative 994 pWe are using MS Word as a spell checker for a few fields on a private company web site, and when IE security settings are correct it works well.  Zone for the site set to Trusted, and trusted zone modified to allow control to run without prompting.p  pThe script we are using creates a word object and closes it afterward.  While the object exists, a winword.exe process runs, but it is destroyed when the Word object is closed.p  pIf our site is not set in the trusted zone Internet zone with default security level the call that creates the Word object fails as expected, but the winword.exe process is still created.  I do not have any way to interact with this process in the script, so the process stays around until the user logs off users have no way to manually destroy the process, and it wouldnt be a good solution even if they did.  p  pThe call that attempts to create the object is...p  precodetry        wordApplication  new ActiveXObjectWord.Application  catcherror         irrelevant code removed, described in comments..        notify user spell check cannot be used        disable spell check option  codepre  pSo every time the page is loaded this code may be run again, creating yet another orphan winword.exe process.p  pcodewordApplicationcode is, of course, undefined in the catch block.p  pI would like to be able to detect the browser security settings beforehand, but I have done some searching on this and do not think that it is possible.p  pManagement here is happy with it as it is. As long as IE security is set correctly it works, and it works well for our purposes.  We may eventually look at other options for spell check functionality, but this was quick, inexpensive, and does everything we need it to do.p  pThis last problem bugs me and Id like to do something about it, but Im out of ideas and I have other things that are more in need of my attention.p  pBefore I put it aside, I thought Id ask for suggestions here.p

Negative 994 pIm writing a latency sensitive app that in effect wants to wait on multiple condition variables at once. Ive read before of several ways to get this functionality on Linux apparently this is builtin on Windows, but none of them seem suitable for my app. The methods I know of arep  ol lipHave one thread wait on each of the condition variables you want to wait on, which when woken will signal a single condition variable which you wait on instead.pli lipCycling through multiple condition variables with a timed wait.pli lipWriting dummy bytes to files or pipes instead, and polling on those.pli ol  p1 amp 2 are unsuitable because they cause unnecessary sleeping. With 1, you have to wait for the dummy thread to wake up, then signal the real thread, then for the real thread to wake up, instead of the real thread just waking up to begin with  the extra scheduler quantum spent on this actually matters for my app, and Id prefer not to have to use a full fledged RTOS. 2 is even worse, you potentially spend N  timeout time asleep, or your timeout will be 0 in which case you never sleep endlessly burning CPU and starving other threads is also bad.p  pFor 3, pipes are problematic because if the thread being signaled is busy or even crashes Im in fact dealing with separate process rather than threads  the mutexes and conditions would be stored in shared memory, then the writing thread will be stuck because the pipes buffer will be full, as will any other clients. Files are problematic because youd be growing it endlessly the longer the app ran.p  pIs there a better way to do this Curious for answers appropriate for Solaris as well.p

Negative 994 pI have a dependency property on my ViewModel which is the DataContext for my View.  The ViewModel has no reference to the View.  The property on the ViewModel is going to reference a control on the view, but I need to be able to set this property in XAML.p  pHow is this possible  One thought I had was to develop a  custom control which has a Property property and a Value property, so you could do something like this in the View to set the property on the ViewModel  p  precodeltPropertySetter PropertyBinding MyViewModelDependencyProperty ValueBinding ElementNameaControlOnMyView gt codepre  pBefore I went down this route, I wanted to check if there was any other approach I could takep  hr  pThanks for the detailed reply Ray, but if I give you a bit more detail about the problem Im trying to solve, you might get a better idea of why I mentioned the approach I did.p  pBasically, what Im trying to do is set the focus to a textbox when the user hits a button.  Ive written an attached property which you can attach to the Button control, specify what the trigger event is in this case the Click event, and then what control to focus on.  This works really nicely, and keeps everything in XAML.p  pHowever, I now have a use case where the focus should be set to an arbitrary text box from the click event on a button which is part of a toolbar.  This toolbar is itself a user control which is sitting inside another user control, which is inside another user control  This toolbar needs to be reusable across various different forms, and each time, the control to set focus on after you click the button will be different per form.  p  pThats why I had the idea of making the focus control i.e. a textbox a property on the view model itself on my ViewModel base to be precise, and have the ViewModel base code which the toolbar is bound to, set the focus to the control when the button is clicked and the e.g. AddEdit method is called on the ViewModel base.p  pIn unit test land, the control to focus on property will be null, so its .Focus method just wont be called.  So I cant see an issue there.  My problem is then how you set the focus control property from XAML, which is why I had the PropertySetter idea.p  pI dont like the fact that the ViewModel has any reference to controls sitting on the view, but I cant see another way to achieve what I need.  What if the logic that dictates whether to set focus to the control is quite complex  This would sit in the ViewModel surely  Therefore, is there any harm in the ViewModel having this UIElement property  It still knows nothing about the specific View it is bound to, it just knows that there is a control which it needs to set focus to when some action happens on the ViewModel.p

Negative 994 pI understand the benefit to unit testing of preferring the viewmodel over the codebehind.  However, I cannot understand the obsession with achieving completely empty codebehinds.  At compile time, the code behind and the XAML are combined, so they are actually the same thing.  I, to, love using XAML due to its declarative nature which is very cool.  But is there actually any practical reason for insisting that all viewrelated code be XAML rather than Cp

Negative 994 pI wanted to load and display imageem.jpg,em.png having large size e.g. 1800x1200 or 2000x1800 width x height. If I display such large size images 1800x1200 or 2000x1800 in UIImageView, it also consume lot of memory and application is getting crashed. Also as per Apples documentation a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarydocumentationUIKitReferenceUIImageClassReferenceReference.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarydocumentationUIKitReferenceUIImageClassReferenceReference.htmla,we should avoid creatingUIImageobjects that are greater than 1024 x 1024 in size. One solution is to resize image.

But when it loads large image in device context to resize, it consume lot of memory for a second and because of it application is crashing. So this approach is not working. Please share if you have better approach to resize without crashing it.p  pAlso in thisa hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarydocumentationUIKitReferenceUIImageClassReferenceReference.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarydocumentationUIKitReferenceUIImageClassReferenceReference.htmla link, Apple said that p  blockquote   pYou should avoid creatingUIImageobjects that are greater than 1024 x 1024 in size. Besides the large amount of memory such an image would consume, you may run into problems when using the image as a texture in OpenGL ES or when drawing the image to a view or layer. This size restriction does not apply if you are performing codebased manipulations, such as resizing an image larger than 1024 x 1024 pixels by drawing it to a bitmapbacked graphics context. In fact, you may need to resize an image in this manner or break it into several smaller images in order to draw it to one of your views..p blockquote  pCan somebody elaborate more on codeThis size restriction does not apply if you are performing codebased manipulations, such as resizing an image larger than 1024 x 1024 pixels by drawing it to a bitmapbacked graphics context.code  How to draw image on bitmapbacked graphics context What isbitmapbacked graphics context It would help me if somebody can share sample code.

Negative 994 pWe have some JavaScript code that resizes codeltdivgtcode elements adjusts heightwidthpaddingmargin etc. based on the dimensions of a parent codeltdivgtcode element, specifically the height and width of the parent we use in the calculation. The parent div height and width is defined in a external CSS file, and codeltlinkgtcode is used to include the stylesheet, in the codeltheadgtcode section of the page. All stylesheets are included before javascripts. The JavaScript resize code is fired inside of a jQuery document ready event using the standard codefunction code. All stylesheets and javascripts automatically have timestamps appended to them Rails application to ensure they are not cached in development.p  pIn Firefox 3.6 the resizing works every time. However in Safari 5, occasionally the resizing fails, because the parent heightwidth is incorrect, which appears to be because the stylesheet has not loaded before the JavaScript. Frustratingly, this happens every few times, and is different depending on the browsermachine load. I can put the resizing code inside a codesetTimeoutcode and delay it by 1 second or so and get it to work reliably, but this is not a releasable solution because it is too slow, and still varies by machine. Ideally there would be a way to emguaranteeem the stylesheet is downloaded, then fire the JS resize code. p  pFirst of all, is this a bad design, to have JS resizing based on CSS loaded from an external stylesheet Im considering trying to place the height and width inline so it is rendered from the server, but this requires significant app code change and tighter coupling to the UI, and Id like to avoid inline style if possible. Is there a webkit event by chance when stylesheets are loaded I dont think there is. Any suggestions on a method other than a timeout to ensure all stylesheets are loaded before firing JavaScript Anyone else experienced differences in stylesheet load ordertiming between Webkit and other browsers and have a solution to share I could use some fresh thinking on this problem.p  pNote in general for images, we use the load codething.loadfncode event on images to ensure they are loaded before applying any JavaScript to them. That would be a good pattern to follow if such a thing existed. Thanksp

Negative 994 pI am building a windows forms application where a very consistent look and feel across all modules is of very high priority. Apart from standard .NET controls it uses a lot of third party controls from different vendors. I would like to have the ability to change the entire look and feel of the application in one go, may be with upgraded versions of the software. Very much like skinning, but generally I have seen that skinning abilities by third party providers work well with their set of controls only while I have controls from multiple vendors.p  pI am planning to build a complete set of user controls inherited from either .NET controls or third party controls where relevant, and use our set of controls only. That way I might have to create a lot of controls e.g. Text, DropDown, List, Grid, DTPicker, etc. etc. but I guess I will have a reasonable command over the look and feel, i.e. I can propagate any changes in the base e.g. use Tahoma font in all places instead of MS Sans Serif by just rebuilding the complete app.p  pI was also thinking that the ability to change the font across the app alone, among others, is something that would cost almost all types of controls to be inherited.p  pQuestionsp  ol lipDo you feel that this is the right way control inheritance to proceed towards consistent look and feel across an app pli lipDo you support the ability to change the entire application font in one shot as a good requirementpli ol  pSuggestions, comments are greatly appreciated. p

Mostly because Air has a lot more oomph when it comes to the general look, feel and customization of its UI.

As an examplep  precodeltnexteventgt   lttitlegtMy Conferencelttitlegt   ltlocationgtLondon, UKltlocationgt ltnexteventgt codepre  pThat XML might change, but every time I load my view, I want to load the current event and store it as an object in my Django application. For this example, Im not concerned with checking duplicates. p  pMy question is, where structurally is the best place to perform the loading of this data, and how to I programatically create these objects in Djangop  pemNote Im happy using codelxmlcode and codeurllibcode to parse and load the XML, so answers dont need to dwell too much on that aspect.emp

Negative 994 pIm writing a particular serialisation system. The first version works well. Its a hierarchial stringkey, datavalue system. So to get a particular value, you navigate to a particular node and say getIntsome key etc. etc. p  pMy issue with the current system is that the file size gets quite large very quickly. p  pIm going to combat this by adding a string table. The issue with this is that I cant think of a way to support the old system. All I have is a file identifier which is 32 bits long. p  pI can change the file identifier, but everytime I make another change to the format, Ill need to change the identifier again. p  pWhats an elegant way to implement new features while still supporting the old features p  pIve studied the PNG format and creating chunks seems like a good way to go. p  pIs there any other advice you can give me on chunk dependencies and so forthp
Negative 994 pthe following code is a handler that takes in a Percent percent of the graph to show as blue, Max maximum value, and a Gallons value number to create a thermometerstyle progress meter. It outputs a graph which is added to a web form as codeltimg srcThermometer.ashx alt gtcode. p  pSince this graph is intended to show progress as the number of gallons of water saved, it would be nice to have the blue color fill up a water barrel image. To do so I have attempted to add a barrel image with a transparent interior to the web form and tried to position it in front of the thermometer image but this has not worked, as it seems impossible to layer an image on top of one created using a handler.p  pMy question is this is it possible to added the barrel image through code so that is serves as the outline for the blue thermometer Or does the barrel image need to be created from scratch in the code I fear the latter since I am probably unable to code it.p  pPlease see below and let me know if there is anything I can do. p  pThank youp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Web using System.Drawing using System.Net using System.Drawing.Imaging using System.Web.UI.HtmlControls namespace rainbarrel      public class Thermometer  IHttpHandler              public bool IsReusable                      get  return false                    public void ProcessRequestHttpContext context                      int Percent  25             int Max  20000             bool Gallon  true              float Pixels  floatPercent  2.15f             Bitmap TempImage  new Bitmap200, 250             Graphics TempGraphics  Graphics.FromImageTempImage             TempGraphics.FillRectangleBrushes.White, new Rectangle0, 0, 200, 250             Pen TempPen  new PenColor.Black             BarrelFillTempImage, Percent             bool DrawText  true             float Amount  Max             for float y  20.0f y lt 235.0f y  10.75f                              TempGraphics.DrawLineTempPen, 119, y, 125, y                 if DrawText                                      Font TempFont  new FontArial, 8.0f, FontStyle.Regular                     if Gallon                                              TempGraphics.DrawStringAmount.ToString   Gal, TempFont, Brushes.Black, 130, y                                          else                                              TempGraphics.DrawStringAmount.ToString, TempFont, Brushes.Black, 130, y                                          DrawText  false                                  else DrawText  true                 Amount  Max  100  5.0f                           string etag    Percent.GetHashCode               string incomingEtag  context.Request.Headers[IfNoneMatch]              context.Response.Cache.SetExpiresDateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime.AddDays1             context.Response.Cache.SetCacheabilityHttpCacheability.Public             context.Response.Cache.SetMaxAgenew TimeSpan7, 0, 0, 0             context.Response.Cache.SetRevalidationHttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches             context.Response.Cache.SetETagetag              if String.CompareincomingEtag, etag  0                              context.Response.StatusCode  intHttpStatusCode.NotModified                 context.Response.End                          else                              context.Response.ContentType  imageGif                 TempImage.Savecontext.Response.OutputStream, ImageFormat.Gif                 TempImage.MakeTransparent                                private void BarrelFillBitmap TempImage, int Percent                      if Percent  100                              FillRectangleTempImage, 60, 20, 235                          else                              FillRectangleTempImage, 60, int235.0f  floatPercent  2.15f, 235                                private void FillRectangleBitmap TempImage, int x, int y1, int y2                      int MaxDistance  50             for int i  x  MaxDistance i lt x  MaxDistance i                              for int j  y1 j lt y2 j                                      float Distance  floatMath.Absi  x                     int BlueColor  int255.0f  1.0  Distance  2.0f  MaxDistance                     TempImage.SetPixeli, j, Color.FromArgb30, 144, BlueColor                                               codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI found this post here which showed me how to solve a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1239624overlayingimageswithgdioverlaying images with GDIap  pHere is my solutionp  precodeImage Barrel  Image.FromFileCInetpubwwwrootbarrelbarreltrans.png             TempGraphics.DrawImageBarrel, 5, 0, 120, 240             Barrel.Dispose codepre  pHowever, The quality of the png layer is bad slightly blurry, although the original is very sharp and clear.

This is fairly temporary cache as I have set the expiration policy to Absolute and the timeout to 2 minutes.  I also have a CacheDependencyKey that resets everytime the page loads. I did this so that caching will primarily be used when someone loads a large dataset and begins paging or sorting through the data. And this prevents any issues with the data not being fresh. If they refresh, it is fresh.p  pWe have been having an issue lately where the server stops responding to requests until we recycle the associated app pool.  The server has 2GB of RAM. Server 2003. x86p  pTo get around this, weve set the app pool to recycle automatically every 30 minutes. This isnt a good long term solution obviously.p  pI have been unable to find any clear memory leaks, so I suspect the problem is the space caching the SqlDataSources is taking up. However, I havent been able to find any information online about how caching and memory usage work and how to prevent memory problems.p  pSo, my questionsp  ol liIs there a rule of thumb for SqlDataSource caching or anything I need to do as a programmer to clean up cache, even after it should have expiredli liWhen does cache expire Automatically when the expiration timeout is reached or dependency is reset Or, is it whenever GC gets around to itli liWhat is the best way to find the memory needs of this application other than putting it under real load and watch it die Ive read about profiling ASP.net applications, but havent found a clear strategy for this. li ol  pI apologize if these are stupid questions. Please forgive my ignorance.p  pThanks in advancep  pClifp

Negative 994 pAn excerpt from the stairway bookp  blockquote   pIf efficiency is very important, lean towards using a class. Most Java   runtimes make a virtual method invocation of a class member a faster operation   than an interface method invocation. Traits get compiled to interfaces   and therefore may pay a slight performance overhead. However, you should   make this choice only if you know that the trait in question constitutes a performance   bottleneck and have evidence that using a class instead actually   solves the problem.p blockquote  pI wrote some simple code to see what really happens behind the scenes. And I did notice codeinvokevirtualcode being used in case of an abstract class and codeinvokeinterfacecode in case of an interface. But no matter what kind of code I wrote they always roughly performed the same.

Negative 994 pI have two PLSQL systems, residing in two separate databases. SystemA will need to populate SystemBs tables. This will probably be done over a datalink. Everytime a set of records is inserted in SystemBs tables, a process in SystemB must run. I could wait for SystemA to complete and then run a script to start processing in SystemB, but since SystemA could spend many hours processing and then populating SystemB, Id rather that SystemB handle each set of records as soon as they become available each set can be processed indpendently of the others so this should work OK.p  pWhat Im not sure of is how I can do evendriven programming in PLSQL. Id need SystemA to notify SystemB that a set is ready for processing. My first idea was to have a special event table in SystemB and then when SystemA finishes a set, it inserts into the event table and there is a trigger on insert that starts the process and the process could be a long one, possibly 510 minutes per process in SystemB. I dont have enough experience with triggers in Oracle to know if this is an established way of doing it, OR if theres a better mechanism. Suggestions Tips Advicep

It would be convenient for my clients if they didnt have to rebuild the assembly using C if they wish to use my application, so i was wondering if there was a way to fix this.p  pI looked into this problem for a while and thought it might be because my assembly wasnt a strong named assembly, since I think C does that automatically, so i tried doing it in my batch file and it couldnt recognize the al and sn commands necessary to generate the cryptographic key to give an assembly a strong name, and i tried doing it in the  signing tab in the C project properties, but i encountered the same problem. Any ideas how to fix thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 994 pI may be trying to abuse the preprocessor. I want to see if what I have in mind is even possible.p  pMy class has properties that all have the same bodies. I want to generate these bodies with a preprocessor macro. E.g.p  precode float accelerometerSensitivity      return [dict floatForSelectorcmd or1]   void setAccelerometerSensitivityfloat n      [dict setFloatn forSelectorcmd]     [dict writeToFile[self globalDataFilename] atomicallyYES]    float returnSpringTension      return [dict floatForSelectorcmd or0]   void setReturnSpringTensionfloat n      [dict setFloatn forSelectorcmd]     [dict writeToFile[self globalDataFilename] atomicallyYES]   setForSelector methods are in a category on NSMutableDictionary and depend on a function that translates selectors into strings  NSString keyFromSelectorSEL selector codepre  pThe idea is that instead of using string literals or string constants as keys into the dictionary, I derive the string from the selector name. This way I am sure that the spelling of the key matches the property name and essentially get the benefit of compiletime validation of dictionary keys.p  pWhat I want to do is say something like codeSELECTORPROPERYaccelerometerSensitivitycode and have it expand into the the getter and the setter. The main difficulty I have in implementing this as a preprocessor macro is generating the setter name from the property name. I need to uppercase the first letter of the property name, and I have no idea how to do that in the preprocessor.p

Negative 994 pI originally had all of my modules in one package. I recently created a subpackage in the original package, and moved a few modules into that. My src folder, and the 2 package folders, are all in my PYTHONPATH.p  pSince I relocated those modules, changes that Im making to their .py files dont seem to be making their way into the generated py.class files, which I believe are ultimately what get run, based on what codeprint FILEcode spits out.p  pThe .class files are located in the toplevel packages directory, which I believe is because the first place they are imported from is within a module thats in that package. So I think theyre in the right place.p  pMoving the modules back to the toplevel package does make the problem go away, but being forced to have all modules in one package is hardly a solution. Is there something I have to do to register a module as part of a package, other than having it in a folder with an codeinit.pycodep  pstrongNote The rest of this question is just the symptoms that have caused me to conclude that the .class files are not being updated when I change the .py files.

Negative 994 pI have a list of N JSliders N does not change procedurally, only as I add more features. Currently N equals 4. The sum of all the sliders values must equal to 100. As one slider moves the rest of the sliders shall adjust. Each slider has values that range from 0 to 100.p  pCurrently I am using this logic when a slider is changed pseudocodep  precodenewValue  currentSlider.getValue  otherSliders  allSliders sans currentSlider othersValue  summation of otherSliders values properOthersValue  100  newValue  ratio  properOthersValue  othersValue  for slider in  otherSlider      slider.value  slider.getValue  ratio codepre  pThe problem with this setup is sliders values are stored as ints. So as I adjust the sliders I get precision problems sliders will twitch or not move at all depending on the ratio value. Also the total value does not always add up to 100.p  pDoes anyone have a solution to this problem without creating an entirely new JSlider class that supports floats or doublesp  pIf you want an example of the behavior I want, visit a hrefhttpwww.humblebundle.com relnofollowHumble Indie Bundlea and scroll to the bottom of the page.p  pthank youp  pp.s. Multiplying the values by the ratio allows for the user to lock values at 0. However, I am not sure what to do when 3 of the 4 sliders are at 0 and the 4th slider is at 100 and I move the 4th slider down. Using the logic above, the 3 sliders with 0 as their value stay put and the 4th slider moves to where the user puts it, which makes the total less than 100, which is improper behavior. p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere is the SSCCEp  precodeimport javax.swing. import javax.swing.event.ChangeEvent import javax.swing.event.ChangeListener import java.awt. import java.util.LinkedList  public class SliderDemo      static LinkedListltJSlidergt sliders  new LinkedListltJSlidergt      static class SliderListener implements ChangeListener              boolean updating  false          public void stateChangedChangeEvent e                      if updating return             updating  true              JSlider source  JSlidere.getSource              int newValue  source.getValue             LinkedListltJSlidergt otherSliders  new LinkedListltJSlidergtsliders             otherSliders.removesource              int otherValue  0             for JSlider slider  otherSliders                              otherValue  slider.getValue                           int properValue  100  newValue             double ratio  properValue  doubleotherValue              for JSlider slider  otherSliders                              int currentValue  slider.getValue                 int updatedValue  int currentValue  ratio                 slider.setValueupdatedValue                           int total  0             for JSlider slider  sliders                              total  slider.getValue                          System.out.printlnTotal    total              updating  false                    public static void mainString[] args              JFrame frame  new JFrameSliderDemo         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE          Container container  frame.getContentPane         JPanel sliderPanel  new JPanelnew GridBagLayout         container.addsliderPanel          SliderListener listener  new SliderListener          GridBagConstraints gbc  new GridBagConstraints         gbc.gridx  0         int sliderCount  4         int initial  100  sliderCount         for int i  0 i lt sliderCount i                      gbc.gridy  i             JSlider slider  new JSlider0, 100, initial             slider.addChangeListenerlistener             slider.setMajorTickSpacing50             slider.setPaintTickstrue             sliders.addslider             sliderPanel.addslider, gbc                   frame.pack         frame.setVisibletrue       codepre

Negative 994 pI am writing a new canvas app using the iframe approach. My backend supports both HTTP and HTTPS for the canvas responses, but it seems by default Facebook puts users on HTTP and sends all the important credentials i.e. access tokens in the signedrequest payload, etc directly in plain text over HTTP. This is of course a security vulnerability on shared networks coffee shops, offices, etc, where it would be trivial to sniff the access tokens.p  pHow can I force all my canvas requests to operate over HTTPS, and protect my users credentialsp  pI think all developers should want  or be required  to do this. While I am new to Facebook development, I am surprised that they would not be using HTTPS for all direct transmissions of user access tokens. Oauth 1.0 had mechanisms to enable the use of access tokens over HTTP since requests had to be signed by the client application but OAuth 2.0 did away with all of that in favor of using HTTPS for any request with an embedded credential. Facebook helped design OAuth 2.0 and is, afaics, undermining the security of the design by deviating from HTTPS usage in canvas requests.p

Negative 994 pWere using jQuery Mobile to create a web app for iOS devices.p  pIn testing on the iPhone, we noticed hidden images that appear via jQuery e.g., show, fadeIn for the first time will appear black momentarily before the image loads into the element.p  pPer the advice of other SO posts, we load the images as background images to an element, which allows us to account for Retina vs. nonRetina displays.p  pWe dont believe this is related to the flicker problem described in other SO posts, as we already implemented the uipage solution.p  pWe suspect this is due to jQuery only loading visible background images first. We can hack this, of course, by showing elements off screen, but were wondering if a more elegant workaround exists.p

Negative 994 pI have been trying to understand the user level and kernel level threads better but I feel I am completely lost. I framed few questions to clarify my doubts.p  pI read somewhere that threads can be supported in the following ways.p  ol lipCompletely managed at user level. Kernel is unaware of it. When one thread gets blocked, even though there are runnable threads, they do not get a chance to runpli lipKernel threads Scheduled by kernel In kernels view, it is like a process only, but a lightweight process. Each such thread is a schedulable entity. In this case, are there any support needed from the user level library Are there any scheduling happens at the user space Do any systems use such thread modelspli lipUser threads on top of kernel threads Here kernel is aware of the threads that are running in the user space. So user level threads can make blocking calls and kernel can run other threads from the same process. So in this case, do we have two different schedulers  one in kernel level and one in user level If so, What is the purpose of user level scheduler Also, I read that, if one user level thread blocks, then the kernel thread on which the user thread was running, is also blocked And if that kernel thread was the only thread that was running on a processor, then the processor becomes unusable. If the user level thread is blocked, why can not the kernel pick another user level thread and run it with the same kernel thread They say that the solution is, to have multiple kernel threads and context switch between them. In this case, if all the kernel threads are blocked because the corresponding user level thread blocks, then none will be running in the system. Instead of this, why can not we change the association i.e., change the user level thread that runs on a given kernel thread In this case, we can avoid the need to create multiple kernel threads rightpli ol  hr  pI know some of these questions might not make sense. But I read a lot of materials and got confused enough. Please clarify. I would greatly appreciate if you can suggest any good online materialresearch papertext books that talk about the basics of userkernel threads and the varying scheduling policies.p

Negative 994 pIm working on a script that loops through an array of LED UIImageViews that are setup in numerical order and are selected by tag. Depending on the step aka number its on the led image is shown as on or off. The main goal of this method is to take the current step and display the LED on image while subtracting it by one and display the LED off image for the previous step. So, only one LED should be lit up at a time.p  pUnfortunately, I can only get the LED on image to display correctly. All of the LEDs in the sequence light up, but they never turn off.

However, I now have the need to rename many of the associations in the designer.  The problem is that each time I have to recreate the LINQ to SQL files I lose the change that I manually made to the files.  Can someone tell me if there are any new solutions andor methods for solving this problem.  The post that I have included as well as many other dated sources of information mentions that SQLMetal and Huagati are good tools.  Additionally, I have read that you can manually create your LINQ to SQL files rather than autogenerate them with the designer this is what I had to do when using Hibernate with Java.p  pI know that manually creating the domain classes and mapping files will be consuming.  I am not familiar with SQLMetal or Huagati.  Can anyone recommend the most elegant or preferred way to deal with this issue  I know that I could use Entity Framework but, I have inherited this project and I am under a very tight deadline.  I can refactor it to another Framework once I have this phase complete.p

Negative 994 pI have 5 functions that need to be run on a separate thread. Grand Central Dispatch is supposed to be more efficient than threads so I decided to use it. Each function has an infinite while loop  codewhiletruecode that runs throughout the duration of the program. So the function doesnt return until the program exists. The thing is though, GCD doesnt run queues at the same time  it runs each queu one at a time. When the first queu completes, it begins the second queu. If I put each function on a queue, only one will run because Grand Central Dispatch will be waiting for the first one to return to run the next one but the function will never return since it is an infinite while loop. Is there any way I can use GCD with infinite loop functions Or should I just use threads p  pXcode 3.2.6 on Mac OSX Snowleopard 10.6.8.p
Negative 994 pIve been trying to solve this bad reference for 2 days now, but I cannot find a fix.p  pMy application is a basic todo list with several pages UIPageControl for different categories and a first page for statistics about the tasks the user has finished.  if you got 3 categories, you end up with 4 pages.p  pIt loads an array of categories from NSUserDefaults, which can be modified by a modal view accessed through a UIButton just like the i in the wheather app. p  pThe Page Control is built by the codeViewControllercode class, which is the primary view. For each element in the array of categories, the view controller generates a new codeTasksPageViewControllercode class instance and instantiates a storyboard view for it. p  pEverything was working fine untill I put a codeUITableViewcode in the codeTasksPageViewControllercode view in storyboard and linked its dataSource to the same class. p  pAfter implementing the required classes for the UITableView dataSource in the codeTasksPageViewControllercode, it runs fine, but if I try to go to the modal view for modifying the categories, when I press DONE and it should reload the ViewController and rebuild the many pages for the UIPageControll, the application crashes with a EXECBADACCESS. p  pDebugging with NSZombiesEnabled, I gotp  blockquote   p20120212 185549.460

Negative 994 pIm having a problem with checkbox bindings not quite working with KnockoutJS 2.0.  I have an array of objects.  One of the properties of those objects is an array of different objects.  In the child objects there are a few properties, one of which is a boolean.  I build a list for each parent object and under each parent I show the children.  For each list of children I have two views, a read only and an edit view.  In the read only I have images that represent whether or not the item is checked based on the boolean property.  This works and if I update the boolean value through the console, Im seeing what I would expectthe image goes away or displays based on the value I assign.  In the edit view, the images are replaced with a checkbox.  I see the same behavior when I update the value through the consoleit is checked when I expect it to be and not when I dont.  The problem comes in when I check or uncheck the checkbox.  Doing this doesnt change the underlying value the checkbox is bound to.p  pHeres the basic idea of my data.p  precode[              xxx yyy,         xxx yyy,         ...

Negative 994 pI use springhibernate template to process entities. There is rather big amount of entities to be loaded all at once, so I retrieve an iterator from hibernate template.p  pEvery entity should be processed as a single unit of work. I tried to put entity processing in a separate transaction propagation  REQUIREDNEW. However I ended with exception stating that proxy is bounded to two sessions. This is due to suspended transaction used for iterator lazy loading. I am using the same bean for lazy loading and for processing entities. May be it should be refactored into two separate daos one for lazy loading and one for processingp  pThen I tried to use single transaction that is committed after each entity is processed. Much better here, there are no exceptions during entity processing, but after processing is finished and method returns, exception is thrown from spring transaction managing code.p  precodeTransactional public void processManyManyEntities      org.hibernate.Sesstion hibernateSession  myDao.getHibernateTemplate.getSessionFactory.getCurrentSession     IteratorltEntitygt entities  myDao.findEntitesForProcessing     while entities.hasNext          Entity entity  entities.next         hibernateSession.beginTransaction         anotherBean.processSingleEntityentity         hibernateSession.getTransaction.commit       codepre  pcodeprocessSingleEntitycode is a method in another bean annotated with codeTransactionalcode, so there is one transaction for all entities. I checked what transaction causes an exception it is the very first transaction returned from codehibernateSession.beginTransactioncode, so it just not updated in transaction manager.p  pThere are several questionsp  pstrikeis it possible to avoid session bind exception without refactoring the daostrike that is not relevant question as problem is with Session and hibernate not with daop  pis it possible to update transaction in the transaction manager strongsolvedstrongp  pis it possible to use the same transaction for codeanotherBean.processSingleEntityentitycode without codeTransactionalcode annotation on codeprocessManyManyEntitiescodep
Negative 994 pIm working on a school project which is to create an GPS for an android platform. Im working in Java. All the information regarding addresses is saved in text files looking like this  139284664 Bjrlandavgen 26493483 57.7278007 11.9353406. ID number, name, ref number, latitude, longitude.p  pThe problem Im having is that I dont know what to save this into in my program. I started out with array lists but then I get Java heap space problems so I moved on to using HashMaps, but then I got the problem that some of the names will be the same AND when searching for an address I want to be able to use some sort of code.containcode and not code.equalscode. Another requirement we have is that the application has to be offline with only a GPS signal, no internet connection. Is there any kind of list, map or anything I can use to bypass these problemsp

Negative 994 pIm making a fairly complex HTML 5  Javascript game. The client is going to have to download images and data at different points of the game depending on the area they are at. Im having a huge problem resolving some issues with the Data Layer portion of the Javascript architecture.p  pThe problems I need to solve with the Data Layerp  ol liData used in the application that becomes outdated needs to be automatically updated whenever calls are made to the server that retrieve fresh data.li liData retrieved from the server should be stored locally to reduce any overhead that would come from requesting the same data twice.li liAny portion of the code that needs access to data should be able to retrieve it easily and in a uniform way regardless of whether the data is available locally already.li ol  pWhat Ive tried to do to accomplish this is build a data layer that has two main components 1. The portion of the layer that gives access to the data through get methods 2. The portion of the layer that stores and synchronizes local data with data from the server.p  pThe workflow is as followsp  pWhen the game needs access to some data it calls get method in the data layer for that data, passing a callback function. p  precodebs.data.getInventory teamId this.refTeam.PartyId, callback this.inventories.initialize.bindthis.inventories  codepre  pThe get method determines whether the data is already available locally. If so it either returns the data directly if no callback was specified or calls the callback function passing it the data.p  pIf the data is not available, it stores the callback method locally setupListener and makes a call to the communication object passing the originally requested information along.p  precodegetInventory function obj       if obj.teamId ampamp this.teamInventory[obj.teamId]  obj.refresh          this.setupListenerthis.inventoryNotifier, obj         bs.com.getInventory teamId obj.teamId           else if typeof obj.callback  function          if obj.teamId              obj.callbackthis.team[obj.teamId].InventoryList                   else          if obj.teamId              return this.team[obj.teamId].InventoryList                codepre  pThe communication object then makes an ajax call to the server and waits for the data to return.p  pWhen the data is returned a call is made to the data layer again asking it to publish the retrieved data.p  precodegetInventory function obj      if obj.teamId          this.doAjaxCall orig obj, url ItemGetTeamEquipment  obj.teamId, event inventoryRefreshed       , doAjaxCall function obj       var that  this      if this.inprocess[obj.url  obj.data]          this.inprocess[obj.url  obj.data]  true         .ajax             type obj.type  GET,             contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,             dataType json,             data obj.data,             url obj.url,             async true,             success function data                  try                      ig.firebs.com, obj.event,  data data, orig obj.orig                                   catch ex                       this enables ajaxComplete to fire                     ig.logex.message  n  ex.stack                                  finally                      that.inprocess[obj.url  obj.data]  false                              ,             error function   that.inprocess[obj.url  obj.data]  false                 codepre  pThe data layer then stores all of the data in a local object and finally calls the original callback function, passing it the requested data.p  precodepublishInventory function data       if this.inventory this.inventory        for var i  0 i lt data.data.length i          if this.inventory[data.data[i].Id]              this.preservingUpdatethis.inventory[data.data[i].Id], data.data[i]                  else              this.inventory[data.data[i].Id]  data.data[i]                     if we pulled this inventory for a team, update the team      with the inventory     if data.orig.teamId ampamp this.team[data.orig.teamId]          this.teamInventory[data.orig.teamId]  true         this.team[data.orig.teamId].InventoryList  []         for var i  0 i lt data.data.length i              this.team[data.orig.teamId].InventoryList.pushdata.data[i]                     set up the data well notify with     var notifyData  []      for var i  0 i lt data.data.length i          notifyData.pushthis.inventory[data.data[i].Id]           ig.firethis.inventoryNotifier, refresh, notifyData, null, true  codepre  pThere are several problems with this that bother me constantly.

Negative 994 pWe have an old CC .dll that a customer accesses via COM. p  pWe have tried to replace our old .dll with a new one written i .NET. p  pCustomer cannot recompile their client so it is important that the old .dll can be replaced simply by COM unregister  register new using regsvr32  regasm.p  pWe believe we have built the .NET .dll with the same COM interface as the old GUIDs, names, dispids etc. all match. We have verified this by writing our own C test application and it continues to work when we unregister old .dll  register new one. p  pThe problem is that the customers client failes to start.p  pStrangely if we leave the old .dll registered e.g. both .dlls are registerd it works The customers application starts and calls methods in our new .dll. But as soon as we unregister the old .dll the application fails to start again. p  pWe have tried different ways to register the new .dll using regasm with codebase option, tbl, etc. p  pIf I inspect with OLECOM Viewer I can see some minor differences between new and old .dll, for example the type library name differs. But I suppose since our own C test client works with either .dll the COM interfaces are enough similarp  pPlease, anyone has any idea How is it possible for one C client to load with our new .dll while another fails Why do both work if we leave the old .dll registered in parallel to the new one Is there any explanation why the two C clients behave differentlyp  hr  pUPDATE  The error message in the client says p  h2failed when running CLSIDFromProgID. Check if [myDll].dll is registered.h2  pKind Regards P.Tp

Negative 994 pI would like to create a textwidgetcomponent wich looks like the firefox address bar. I mean a Textfield wich allows me to place little Buttons inside the field e.g. cancelreload...p  pI tried customizing a JLayeredPane, by creating a custom layout manager which maximizes the Textfield, and places the remainder from right to left. My problem is that this gave painting issues, I would not always see the items I added over the textfield. This might be Jython related, I try suppling codejava.lang.Integer1code to the codeJLayeredPane.addcode. However the Layers are ordered exactly reverse to what the documentation says.p  pTO cricumvent this I derived my own codeJLayeredPanecode class and redefined codepaintcode to call codepaintComponentscode which in turn iterates over all components and calls their paint method, starting with the textbox, the rest thereafter.p  pHowever I dont always get the updates right away, meaning the buttons are hiddenonly partly displayed and I cant Interact with the button.p  ol liWhat do I have to acutally see the update on screen is it hidden in a bufferli liHow can I make it so that I can interact with the buttonsli liHow can I shorten the Texxtfield, so that the text starts scrolling to the front before I reach the end of the Textfield so that the text does not get hidden by the buttons I still want the Textfields area to extend under the buttonsli ol  pstrongeditstrong the button is only displayed in the right place after i make the window smaller, after that it is also clickablep  pstrongedit2strong I took the freedom to boil the answer down to this, which hides away a lot of that button codeunneccessary stuffp  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event.ItemEvent import java.awt.event.ItemListener import javax.swing.  public class playground       private Icon errorIcon  UIManager.getIconOptionPane.errorIcon     private Icon infoIcon  UIManager.getIconOptionPane.informationIcon     private Icon warnIcon  UIManager.getIconOptionPane.warningIcon      public playground          JPanel panel  new JPanel         panel.setLayoutnew BorderLayout          panel.addmakeButton, BorderLayout.WEST          JTextField text  new JTextField20         text.setBordernull         panel.addtext, BorderLayout.CENTER         JPanel buttonsPanel  new JPanel         buttonsPanel.setOpaquefalse         buttonsPanel.setLayoutnew GridLayout1, 2, 2, 2          buttonsPanel.addmakeButton         buttonsPanel.addmakeButton          panel.addbuttonsPanel, BorderLayout.EAST         panel.setBackgroundtext.getBackground          JMenuBar menuBar  new JMenuBar         menuBar.addpanel         menuBar.addBox.createHorizontalGlue         JFrame frame  new JFrameMenuGlueDemo         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         frame.addmenuBar         frame.pack         frame.setVisibletrue           public JToggleButton makeButton          final JToggleButton button  new JToggleButton         button.setFocusablefalse         button.setMarginnew Insets0, 0, 0, 0         button.setContentAreaFilledfalse         button.setBordernull          button.setIconerrorIcon         button.setRolloverIconinfoIcon         button.setSelectedIconwarnIcon         button.setPressedIconwarnIcon          button.addItemListenernew ItemListener               Override             public void itemStateChangedItemEvent e                  if button.isSelected                   else                                                  return button           public static void mainString[] args          javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable               Override             public void run                  playground menuGlueDemo  new playground                             codepre

Negative 994 pIm trying to make a calendar popup on a website to allow the user to pick a date.  This is for a remindertask implementation.  I do not want the user to be able to select a previous date or time.  p  pAll that anyone has given for advice to this question is codemindatetoday get new Datecode.  Which is great, because it makes previous days not able to be selected.  However, people could still choose a time of the day today, that is previous to right now.  So, one would naturally pick codeminHourcode and codeminMinutecode, but those retain for future days as well.  So if I have all 3 of those set, we get close, but the issue is, if I select a date of tomorrow, it will only allow times of day based off of codeminMinutecode and codeminHourcode, which are based off of your system time of codetoday get new Datecode.  You should be able to select any time you want tomorrow.p  pCan I make the calendar only valid for days and times after right nowp  pThis seems like a natural setting.  codefutureDatesdisabledcode, codepastDatesdisabledcode, etc.p

Negative 994 pI have a multitiered ASP.Net MVC 3 application in which different layers need to share some settings, and I am wondering how to best achieve this. p  pFor now, all my AppSettings are in the Web.config file, but I just added a new project to my solution to create a console application that will be called every night buy the Windows Task Scheduler to perform routine maintenance tasks.

Negative 994 pIm using a periodic timer where the handler function rearms the timer when it is done using modtimer. When I kill the timer using deltimersync and the handler is running, does this mean that the timer gets rearmed and isnt deleted, or does the function somehow kill the timer In the case that it doesnt kill the timer, is there a way to know through the return value if the function had to wait for the handler to finish in that case I can call deltimersync in a loop until the return is not that value.

Negative 994 pIm a little confused about Basic authentication in regards to web browsers. I had thought that the web browser would only send an Authorization header after having received an HTTP 401 status in the previous response. However, it appears that Chrome sends the Authorization header with every request thereafter. It has the data that I entered once upon a time in response to a 401 from my website and sends it with every message according to the developer tools that ship with Chrome and my webserver. Is that expected behavior Is there some header I should use with my 401 to infer that the Authorization stuff should not be cached Im using WWWAuthenticate header currently.p

Negative 994 pI have installed FastRWeb 1.10 on an installation of R 2.15.2 Trick or Treat running on an Ubuntu 10.04 box.  I hope to use the resulting system to run a web service.p  pIve configured the system by setting http.port to 8181 in rserve.conf and unsetting the socket destination.  Ive assigned .http.request to FastRWeb.http.request.  I exchange JSON blobs between the client and the server using HTTP POST the second blob can exceed 150KB in size, and will not fit in an HTTP GET query string.p  pEverything works end to end  I have a little clientside R script which generates JSON RPC calls across the channel.  I see the run function invoked, and see it returned.p  pIve run into a significant performance problem, however the return path takes in excess of 12 seconds from the time run returns including the call to done and the time that the R client gets the return value.  RCurl doesnt seem to be the culprit it appears that something is taking twelve seconds to do a return.p  pDoes anybody have any suggestions of where to look  I can easily shift over to using Apache 2.0 and CGI, but, honestly, Id rather keep everything R centric.p

Negative 994 pI am iteratively building a custom recommender system based on a frequently changing probabilistic latent factor model. I have already written some Java code that implements the model. It factorises the useritem rating matrix into two matrices UxK user feature vectors and IxK item feature vectors to estimate the missing ratings.p  pI am looking for the simplest way to plug perhaps by rewriting my code into a framework to build a recommender system, a baseline, and be able to compare these against each other in a standard way  e.g. cross validation to calculate precision, recall, RMSE... As my system still lacks this, the framework should provide methods to calculate and make recommendations based on the estimated useritem rating matrix.p  pIt looks like Mahout should do the job. However, its documentation says It does not currently support modelbased recommenders.. Can anybody tell me whether what I am trying to achieve is possible with Mahout and whether it is worth spending the time to learn how to use it. If Mahout is not suitable, can you suggest any alternativesp  pMany thanksp

Negative 994 pI am designing an API wrapper in C for a hrefhttpdeveloper.asana.comdocumentation relnofollowAsanaa, a project management solution. During the design process, I ran into a few roadblocks. I am wondering what a good way to design the API wrapper would be.p  pThe Asana API I am integrating with works with REST. The requests return JSON.p  pThere will be 6 data classes User, Task, Project, etc, each containing a bunch of strings to hold the data returned from the REST requests. My first idea with these classes is to give them each factory Parse constructors so I can easily pass in json and get a data object in return. I realize I cant extract the static factory methods into an interface.p  pI will have a REST request class that will manage sending and receiving data from the REST server. It will always return a JSON string.p  pFinally, I would like a AsanaAPI class that will contain methods to wrap those exposed on the REST server i.e GetUser, GetAllUsers, GetTask. Every method either returns a specific data class or an array of data classes. Here are the two casesp  precode    public User GetSingleUserstring userID  me              ifuserID   throw new ArgumentExceptionUserID cannot be blank          string url  string.Format012, userUrl, userID, optfieldsid,name,email,workspaces,workspaces.id,workspaces.name         JSONNode root  JSON.ParseGetResponseurl[data]         return User.Parseroot           public ListltUsergt GetAllUsers              ListltUsergt users  new ListltUsergt          string url  string.Format01, userUrl, optfieldsid,name,email,workspaces,workspaces.id,workspaces.name         JSONArray root  JSON.ParseGetResponseurl[data].AsArray         foreachJSONNode userRoot in root                      users.AddUser.ParseuserRoot                   return users      codepre  pEach method will have that same format, but the User type will be replaced with Project, Task, etc. I want to extract the logic in these two methods because there will be many more methods with almost the exact same format.p  pIn summary, the roadblocks I ran into were the fact thatp  ol liI cant extract the factory constructor method from the data class.li liI cant extract the parsing logic from the request methodsli ol  pIs there something I can do with generics or is there just a better way of designing this projectp

We got a bit stuck with stuck connections with after some idle period and would appreciate any help or things to try.p  pWere using v1.4.1 ofactiverecordoracleenhancedadapter with ojdbc6.jar in a Sinatra app on jruby 1.7.2. My controller calls a helper class method and returns a json string. The helper class method simply queries an Oracle database for data.

We can see one call to establishconnection at the beginning expected. What we dont expect is that right after the sleep, the first connection to the database always gets stuck. What wed see in the log is just 1. After 15 minutes, the client times out and makes another call to the controller. This second call seems to have the effect of waking up the connection pool, in that it always resumes thread 1 and so wed see 2, 4 and 5. Concurrently, wed also see thread 2s log messages 1, 2, 4 and 5. We know because the actual code prints Thread.current.objectid as part of the message.p  pWe tried adding ActiveRecordBase.connection.verify right before execquery but that only shifts the stuck call to the verify line.p  pDid we use the adapter correctly Is there something else we can tryp

Negative 994 pin my developing application of online test, i have stumbled upon a new possibility today about variable length radiobuttonlistcheckboxlist options. As in generalcommon systems we have only 4 optionswhich even i feel is very rigid and incomplete, my client have asked me to create a test which on display gives 4 or 5 optionsmultiple or single select aka radio or check box based on DB entry.p  pNow DB is not a problem ,everything is fine except the fact that how to variate the lenght of control or show that particular control based on given data in gridview. For example our gridview have a Lable for Question and Question No. and two controls checkboxlist and radiobuttonlist for options to be filled by user, so in short he wants top  pRadio Button Listp  ul liDisplay 4 options if db value for multioptions is false and total option is 4li liDisplay 5 options if db value for multioptions is false and total option is 5li ul  pCheck Box Listp  ul liDisplay 4 options if db value for multioptions is true and total option is 4li liDisplay 5 options if db value for multioptions is true and total option is 5li ul  pSo this is the general idea, and i cant figure out how to pt these things in my gridview, Which is needed to show this data as an OMR sheet and i wouldnt even bothered you guys if it was to be a normal test with a Next question button where we display only single question at a time or a simple static 4 option question.p

Negative 994 pThis is strongnotstrong a question how to do things. It is a question of strongwhystrong is it the way it is.p  pArrays in Java know their component type at run time, and because of type erasure we cannot have array objects of generic type variables. Array types involving generics are allowed and checked for sound readwrite, the only issue seem to be the allocator expressions.p  pNotice that the Java compiler also disallows the followingp  precodePongltIntegergt lotsofpong []  new PongltIntegergt[100] codepre  p...where codePongcode is just any old parametric class. There is nothing unknown here. Yes, at runtime, codelotsofpongcode would just be an array of codePongcode, but I cannot see a reason why the compiler cannot remember the type parameter for compiletime purposes. Well, it actually does remember it, because those types exist at compile time, so the only problem seems to be the refusal to give the allocator at compiletime a particular genericparameterinvolving component type.p  pEven if the parameter of codePongcode was a generic type variable that should not make a difference either. The dynamic array would still be an array of codePongcode, requiring per element the size of a codePongcode, which does not depend on its type parameter.p  pYes, I know there are ways around it  either use casts perhaps with SuppressWarning from the nonparametric type, or subclass codePongltIntegergtcode with a nonparametric class and use that type instead. But is there a reason why this kind of allocator is not allowedp

Fortunately, codeatomicflagtestandsetcode and every codeexchangecode operation have this crucial feature they always read fresh data.

Negative 994 pI am pretty new to working with Plists and IOS. I am trying to load a tableview of records, and I am trying to load the Tableview from my documents folder in the project. It used to load from the bundle and then I pointed to the documents folder. I removed the plist from my project, and kept it in the documents folder, but I received a copy error So, please look over my code and give me some idea of how to load from the documents folder in my application. I ran it in debug and it still loading only the 5 records from the plist in the bundle, not the 7 records that reside in my documents folder. Just to note, after I load the initial screen of tableView records, I take the option  at the top to load a blank screen to load another record, this I am writing to the document folder and it works, now I want to display those changes on the Master. I also am not certain how to refresh the screen. I have read a bit about ViewDidLoad, but I am not certain how to use this method.

Negative 994 pAlright, heres the scenario A team of developers wants to ensure all new code matches the defined coding standards and all the unit tests are passing before a commit is accepted. Heres the trick, all of the tests need to run on a dedicated testing machine and we do not have access to modify the git server so this must be done using a local commit hook on each dev machine.p  pWhile the specs are pretty strict were not switching to windows or subversion, for example this is a real world problem so there is some flexibility if you have a solution that almost fits.p  ul liWere using Git and nix. li liThe updated code needs to be sent to another server to run the test suite.li liA list of modified files needs to be provided to ensure they match the coding standard.li liIts a rather large codebase, so we should send the smallest amount of information necessary to ensure identical copies of the codebase.li liIf the tests fail a message needs to be displayed with the error and the commit should be blocked.li liAssume we trust our dev team and its okay to allow the tests to be bypassed with codenoverifycode option.li ul  pstrongThe questionstrong What is the best way to get the test server to sync up with the local environment to run the tests Some sort of hashtohash matching with a git patch for the new commit Skip Git altogether and just do an rsync Something else altogetherp  pstrongUpdate 8713strong I shot myself in the foot by even mentioning the remote repo. The point isnt to block the code from being pushed to the shared  remote repo, its to prevent the local commit from even happening. Whether or not this would be considered a best practice is not really the point in this case, as this is specific to a small team of developers who all want this exact functionality. The question is about the best way to achieve the goal.p

Negative 994 pHere is the situation. I have an Excel worksheet that I developed in the US that uses some VBA code in addition to the worksheet function codeCONVERTcode available with analysis addin, to convert units. I send the worksheet to Germany to be filled up, and when I get it back, it has renamed my convert functions to codeUMWANDELNcode which breaks my sheet in the US.p  pMy question is if I write a VBA wrapper to codeWorksheetFunction.Convertcode and use that instead of the cell formula codeCONVERTcode, will the German office break it, because convert will not be available. Will codeWorksheetFunction.Umwandelncode be available To I try both with error catching p  pSo how can I make my Worksheet usable both in the US and in Germany if I need to rely on the codeCONVERTcode function Is there is VBA solution, or am I stuckp  pAnother workaround would be to rewrite my own convert unit function which might be a hassle with all the different combinations I have.p

Negative 994 pIm creating a fairly simple chrome extension. All it needs to do is remove two dom element whenever I visit a specific website. p  pThe problem is that my script runs when document.ready and checks if the two elements Im looking for exist. The two elements dont exist and then my script does not perform its required task. After the script runs is when the website actually inserts the elements to the html. So my script essentially ran too early. p  pIt doesnt seem like document.ready is actually waiting for all elements to be present. Is there a solution to thisp

This is bc I realized that the values in the table arent known until the user enters them in.p  p[The basic premise of the app allows the user to add information regarding the item and its price. The Listview right now just pulls that information as is off the DB. But I want the ListView to search the DB for items that have the same value, and consolidate it into single view of the ListView. That view would also calculate the average price calculated from the DB if that item had more than one instance entered. Clicking the item in the list would reveal its history, e.g. other times the instances were entered.]p  pI am thinking that dynamic SQL will solve this issue with the search and calculation but Im not sure if its the right track. I am thinking that it would also be used for the 2nd half where you click on the item to look at the history. Can anybody tell me if this is the right train of thought and maybe a good resource to study if that is the case. p  pWould prefer to try and study amp improve my problem solving first rather than just ask about the codep  pThanks so much if anyone can provide guidance.p

All answers that I have found up to now say that it is not possible  one has to enable the parent and disable the child controls except the ones that should still be enabled.p  pHowever, by overriding the Metadata for the IsEnabledProperty in the App.xaml.cs file, I was able to change this default behaviorp  precodeprotected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e      UIElement.IsEnabledProperty.OverrideMetadatatypeofFrameworkElement,              new UIPropertyMetadatatrue,IsEnabledChanged, CoerceIsEnabled   private void IsEnabledChangedDependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e      var childrenCount  VisualTreeHelper.GetChildrenCountd     for int i  0 i lt childrenCount i              var child  VisualTreeHelper.GetChildd, i         child.CoerceValueUIElement.IsEnabledProperty       private object CoerceIsEnabledDependencyObject d, object basevalue      var parent  VisualTreeHelper.GetParentd as FrameworkElement     if parent  null ampamp parent.IsEnabled  false              if d.ReadLocalValueUIElement.IsEnabledProperty  DependencyProperty.UnsetValue                      return false                   return basevalue  codepre  pNow you can manually set the codeIsEnabledcode property on a child, which overrides the parent value.p  pAre there any drawbacks of this approachp

Negative 994 pThis is my first question, so sorry if I am off topic or something is wrong I am creating an android application and i am stuck at somewhere.. I have found tutorials and tried something like following. The scenario is that I want to use XMLParser in my application and I am using tabs with swipable views. I want to display the items in a listview inside a tab fragment. I have managed to get them in listview but the problem is that I cant get it to work in background.

Negative 994 pI am using a game engine from Beginning Android Games and making a breakout game from scratch. I have the paddleballbricks working but right now I am working out the bugs. Randomly, my pong will hit any wall and it will just stick to it and vibrate left and right and kind of just fly off the screen. Another example is sometimes the pong hits the paddle in such a way that instead of bouncing off of it, it goes through it and then proceeds to change direction after it goes through it, I feel like its not obeying my bounds.

UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.  It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for  running httpd, as with most system services.  User www Group www  ltIfModulegt ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin youexample.com    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName www.example.com80    DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your  documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.  DocumentRoot optlocalapache2htdocs DocumentRoot pathtowebrootSymfonyweb    Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect  to which services and features are allowed andor disabled in that  directory and its subdirectories.    First, we configure the default to be a very restrictive set of   features.    ltDirectory gt     Options FollowSymLinks     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI     AllowOverride All     Order deny,allow     Allow from all     Require all granted ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.     This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.  ltDirectory optlocalapache2htdocsgt           Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,      or any combination of        Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews           Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All      doesnt give it to you.           The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see      httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modcore.htmloptions      for more information.          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks            AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.      It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords        Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit          AllowOverride None            Controls who can get stuff from this server.          Order allow,deny     Allow from all  ltDirectorygt    DirectoryIndex sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory  is requested.  ltIfModule dirmodulegt     DirectoryIndex index.php index.html ltIfModulegt    The following lines prevent .htaccess, .htpasswd and .DSStore files and  Mac resource forks and named forks from being viewed by Web clients.  ltFiles  .[Hh][Tt][Dd][Ss][Ss]gt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all     Satisfy All ltFilesgt ltFiles rsrcgt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all     Satisfy All ltFilesgt ltDirectoryMatch ...namedforkgt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all     Satisfy All ltDirectoryMatchgt    ErrorLog The location of the error log file.  If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog logserrorlog    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.  LogLevel warn  ltIfModule logconfigmodulegt           The following directives define some format nicknames for use with      a CustomLog directive see below.          LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti combined     LogFormat h l u t r gts b common      ltIfModule logiomodulegt        You need to enable modlogio.c to use I and O       LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio     ltIfModulegt            The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.      If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt      container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do      define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be      logged therein and not in this file.          CustomLog logsaccesslog common            If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information      Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.          CustomLog logsaccesslog combined ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule aliasmodulegt           Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to       exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client       will make a new request for the document at its new location.      Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAlias cgibin optlocalapache2cgibin  ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule cgidmodulegt           ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX      socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.          Scriptsock logscgisock ltIfModulegt    optlocalapache2cgibin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased  CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.  ltDirectory optlocalapache2cgibingt     AllowOverride None     Options None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt    DefaultType the default MIME type the server will use for a document  if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.  If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, textplain is  a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications  or images, you may want to use applicationoctetstream instead to  keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are  text.  DefaultType textplain  ltIfModule mimemodulegt           TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from      filename extension to MIMEtype.          TypesConfig confmime.types            AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration      file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.          AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.           To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI      You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.          AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml AddType applicationxhttpdphp .php AddType applicationxhttpdphpsource .phps ltIfModulegt    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile  directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.  MIMEMagicFile confmagic    Customizable error responses come in three flavors  1 plain text 2 local redirects 3 external redirects   Some examples ErrorDocument 500 The server made a boo boo. ErrorDocument 404 missing.html ErrorDocument 404 cgibinmissinghandler.pl ErrorDocument 402 httpwww.example.comsubscriptioninfo.html     MaxRanges Maximum number of Ranges in a request before  returning the entire resource, or one of the special  values default, none or unlimited.  Default setting is to accept 200 Ranges. MaxRanges unlimited    EnableMMAP and EnableSendfile On systems that support it,   memorymapping or the sendfile syscall is used to deliver  files.  This usually improves server performance, but must  be turned off when serving from networkedmounted   filesystems or if support for these functions is otherwise  broken on your system.  EnableMMAP off EnableSendfile off   Supplemental configuration   The configuration files in the confextra directory can be   included to add extra features or to modify the default configuration of   the server, or you may simply copy their contents here and change as   necessary.

Is there anyway that to catch the error, write it, then end it. The error can came from any functionp  pPS Lets assume you cant modify or read the program that gives order. This is competition, the reason I said this, is since that when I access the codestderrcode, its empty.p

Negative 994 pI am very new to  RTC source management and recently started using it in my project. Currently i am stuck with an issue for which i could not find any proper answer may be i am missing something below is the description of problem. kindly bear with me for the detailed description. I am using the Eclipse 3.x bundled with STS for development.p  pThere was an incoming changeset which contained a file say processemail.java which had  conflicting changes with the processemail.java version i had in my workspace. I accepted that change and later a red arrow started appearing on the file in my unresolved changes. I tried to auto resolve but RTC threw error that cannot auto resolve use manual resolve.p  pSo i did a manual merge of the file using the compare editor and clicked the mark as resolve button to resolve it.Red arrow gone and My workspace contained merged file. After this a new changeset by the name Merges appeared automatically in my outgoing changes which contained this merged file version.p  pLater i had to do some additional code change in processemail.java which i did and it appeared in Unresolved changes. Now when i try to add the updated version of processemail.java to a brand new change set along with other related files RTC throws error stating cannot create a new change set let the file decide which change set to use. If i select the processemail.java in the unresolved changes it is getting highlighted with a Blue color and the Merges in my outgoing also gets highlighted with that.p  pI am not sure what to do now. Should i add the file to the Merges changeset that got created automatically which i did not try or what will happen if this possible will the version in the Merges get updated with this modified version of processemail.java. i also have other files along with this change what should my approach be. Can anybody please help me with their suggestion on this. been stuck with this issue for a long time now.p  pThanksp  pVikeng21p

Negative 994 pApologies in advance for what I think might be a stupid question. I promise I have searched, but Im not sure if Ive searched for the correct things. Im a very new programmer, Ruby is my first serious language, and I taught myself it over the past few months. Ive also never asked a question on StackOverflow, so hopefully this is acceptably clear and meets the other requirements for questionasking. Here is the questionp  pI have a branching method that calls various different APIs and various different URLs within them, based upon the values passed to the method. As is, it looks likep  precodeif api  x url  httpurl.x.comapivariable elsif api  y url  httpurl.y.comapipublicvar1var2variable codepre  petc.p  pThe urls being called are different for each operation, as are the necessary variables. The variables used in the requests are being created as instance variables at the beginning of the method. The possible values of the instance variables are stored in a large hash or are being passed into the method by the call itself. The hash is structured likep  precodeglobalhash    api1 gt   calltype1 gt info1 gt , info2 gt , calltype2 gt info1 gt , info2 gt  , api2 gt  calltype1 gt info1 gt , info2 gt , calltype2 gt info1 gt , info2 gt    codepre  pThe problem I have is that this branching section goes on for a long time in the codepartially because Ive done it suboptimally, Im sure. Im also sure that my code would be much more efficient if the branching section didnt exist. Ideally, instead of the branching section, Id like to make this happenp  precodeurl  globalhash[api][calltype][url] codepre  pThe value that pulls would be a URL specific to the call type and the apithe address, formatting, and various other differences included. So some values would bep  precodehttpapi.x.comvar1var2variable httpapi.y.compublicvariable codepre  pand so on. So the structures vary, and I need to access the instance variables stored within the method call, but I need to do so dynamically. The issue Ive had is that every way Ive tried to implement this results in the values of the instance variables in the strings for url being set when globalhash is read as the program begins to run, with them all being nil. I need it to check the variable when the request is being made, and not before, basically. I have a similar same issue with setting the postdata for the requestif I could find a way to set it in the hash, Id have cleaner code that runs faster. The postdata is asp  precodepostdata  value gt var1, value2 gt var2, value3 gt var3 codepre  pand so on. The postdata is different for each API and for each calltype the values are different as are the requested variables for them. Id like to implement a set of keyvalue pairs in the hash that look vaguely likep  precodeglobalhash  api1 gt calltype1 gt url gt httpapi.x.comvariable, postdata gt value gt var1, value2 gt var2, etc. codepre  pExcept, of course, it would need to workthe variables it needs to reference are nil when globalhash is being read. Im not sure how best to solve this.p  pThe program works asis, but I have a very derpylooking 80 lines of branching code that figures out the structure of the URL and the postdata, and then requests it.p  pThe only solution Ive considered is creating an instance hash within the method to replace the branching code, that only gets created after declaring the instance variables. However, Im afraid that would create a similar problem to the current one, of it being inefficient to create a huge new hash every time.p  pThanks for reading, and I appreciate your help. I hope the pseudocode is acceptable, I found it the best way to explain my question.p  pEDIT Found a solution. Codep  precodeurl  eval globalhash[api1][calltype1][url] codepre  p[url] references a hrefhttpapi.x.com relnofollowhttpapi.x.comavariable, single quotes prevent interpolation within the hash, eval function puts it in double quotes and string interpolation collects the instance variable at the time it is called. Its an ugly methodology BUT it does let me greatly shorten my code. Source a hrefhttpswww.rubyforum.comtopic3237101 relnofollowhttpswww.rubyforum.comtopic3237101ap

Negative 994 pI am creating a geomipmapped terrain. So far I have it working fairly well. The terrain tessellation near the camera is very high and gets less so the further out the geometry is. The geometry of the terrain essentially follows the camera and samples a heightmap texture based on the position of the vertices. Because the geometry tessellation is very high, you can at times see each pixel in the texture when its sampled. It creates obvious pixel bumps. I figured I might be able to get around this by smoothing the sampling of the heightmap. However I seem to have a weird problem related to some bilinear sampling code. I am rendering the terrain by displacing each vertex according to a heightmap texture. To get the height of a vertex at a given UV coordinate I can usep  precodevec2 worldToMapSpace vec2 worldPosition      return  worldPosition  worldScale  0.5    float getHeight vec3 worldPosition           ifdef USEHEIGHTFIELD         vec2 heightUv  worldToMapSpaceworldPosition.xz         vec2 tHeightSize  vec2 HEIGHTFIELDSIZEWIDTH, HEIGHTFIELDSIZEHEIGHT  both 512         vec2 texel  vec2 1.0  tHeightSize          float coarseHeight  texture2DBilinear heightfield, heightUv,  texel, tHeightSize .r         float coarseHeight  texture2D heightfield, vUv .r         return altitude  coarseHeight  heightOffset     else         return 0.0     endif  codepre  pWhich produces this notice how you can see each pixelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2odr4.png altenter image description herep  pHere is a wireframep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeU8Ag.png altenter image description herep  pI wanted to make the terrain sampling smoother.

Negative 994 pI am working on a project with multiple spring configuration java classes. Many of them have beans from other config classes autowired in and then injected in the constructors of other beans. p  pTo make this as flexible as possible, I have been using spring profiles to define which implementation of an interface to use in the case where multiple are available. p  pThis works fine, but I was wondering if there was any way with Spring that you could define a default bean p  pFor example If no bean of type Foo found on classpath, inject implementation Bar. Else, ignore Bar.p  pI have looked at this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5466462spring3injectdefaultbeanunlessanotherbeanpresentSpring 3 Inject Default Bean Unless Another Bean Presenta, and the solution shown with Java config would work fine if you knew the name of all of the beans, but in my case I will not know what the beans are called.p  pDoes anybody know of a way this can be achievedp

Negative 994 pIn my application I use parses services to connect users to Facebook. When a user tries to connect to an facebook account that is already linked to another user in the app, an error is given and the user is not allowed to connect. Since I am using anonymous users in my app, this is a particular problem if the user deletes the app and reinstalls, as their old account still exists in the database connected to their facebook account, but they now have a new anonymous user account, and cannot link the new account to facebook.p  pWhat is the best way for me to fix this problem If Im not mistaken, there is no way to tell when a user deletes your application, so I cant delete the old user from the database when the app is deleted.  I need a way to either log out the old user and log in the new user when a new user tries to connect to facebook or to allow multiple users to be linked to the same facebook account. Or I suppose to merge the new anonymous user account into the old one that is linked with Facebook.p  pAnyways, has anybody had an issue like this and found a good solutionp

Negative 994 pstrongIm trying to figure out how to share an established connection to a database among classes to execute different SQL statements.strong I read through some of the topics, but as Im fairly new to programming I have a hard time to adapt the given information to my problem.p  pstrongProblemstrong I have two classes with one opening a connection to a database, executing some SQL statments and calling the other class to do the same only using different tables and SQL statments. Now as long as I run the classes separatly with their own main method and connections everything works fine.

Negative 994 pstrongUsing Case IF statements in queriesstrong   SQL 2008p  pI have servers with 3 instances each.

Negative 994 pI am trying to implement a classification NN in Matlab. My inputs are clusters of coordinates from an image. Corresponding to delaunay triangulation vertexes There are 3 clusters results of the optics algorithm in this format img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMN7Q1.jpg altenter image description herep  p Not all clusters are of the same size.. Elements represent coordinates in euclidean 2d space . So 110,12 is a point in my image and the matrix depicted represents one cluster of points. Clustering was done on image edges. So coordinates refer to logical values always 1s in this case on the image matrix.After edge detection there are 3 dense areas in an image, and these collections of pixels are used for classification. There are 6 target classes.p  pSo, my question is how can I format them into single column vector inputs to use in a neural network There is a relevant answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18099345howtonormalizecoordinatesinputsforneuralnetworksherea but I would like some elaboration if possible.  I am probably too tired right now from 12 hours of trying stuff and dont get it 100 D   Remember, there are 3 different coordinate matrices for each picture, so my initial thought was, create an nn with 3 inputs of different length. But how to serialize thisp  pHeres a cluster with its tags on in case it helps img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIKhC9.jpg altenter image description herep
Negative 994 pI have a simple UIView, and inside an imageview. The idea is to have the UIView resize programmatically, and the image view inside automatically stretch so its always same size. For the sake of simplicity I will skip all the parts where I calculate the size needed, but here is the code that is supposed to resize UIView containerView2 AND ImageView imageHolder2p  precode    imageHolder2.clipsToBounds  true     containerView2.clipsToBounds  true      Resize  UIView     var ff  CGRect  containerView2.frame     ff.size.width  175  aspectRatio     ff.size.height  175     containerView2.frame  ff      Resize ImageView to same size, which is inside UIView     var tt  CGRect  imageHolder2.frame     tt.size.width  175  aspectRatio     tt.size.height  175     imageHolder2.frame  tt      containerView2.contentMode  UIViewContentMode.ScaleAspectFill     imageHolder2.contentMode  UIViewContentMode.ScaleAspectFill codepre  pAll this is in a IBAction button. What is strange, is that when I tap the button once, it will resize the UIView but NOT the ImageView. But when I tap a second time, then it will correctly resize the imageView. Why is that And how to fix this Note that I use autolayout and constraint on this project, in this view, but NOT on elements involved in this code.p  pPlease answer in Swift.p

Negative 994 pAhoy, looking for a little helpp  pI am taking sensor data from a microcontroller, sending it to a mysql database, and pulling it with coded3.jsontempdata.php,codep  pI realized that mysql has no good array support, and sending a single value at a time was worthless... So I had the idea to take many values over a known period, and send them as a single string. Said string is the accelX string. I am absolutely flustered with figuring out how to parse the subarray of accelX data...p  pId like to parse those values so I can update a graph with each consecutive iteration of accelX. id is simply an automatically updating index.

Negative 994 pIm attempting to write an application that can read and write to a device that accepts ordinary serial communication through a serial com port. Im using a bluetooth to serial device.

Either method SEEMS to work when I am watching the incoming bluetooth to serial communication on my computer.p  pTo communicate with the serial device, I would normally use PuTTY and hit tab then enter on my keyboard. This puts the serial device in command mode. You can do this multiple times. Thus the tr. After you send a tr, you should be able to enter a command followed by a r. So in PuTTY, I would enter on my keyboard something like tabentercommandstringenter. The command Im sending should change some settings on the serial device, yet when I connect to it through PuTTY, the settings are unchanged.p  pIs there anything I may be overlooking that could be causing this issue I have spent a lot of time trying to figure this out and have yet to come up with a solution.p

If I try to export this new model with combined meshes I get and error saying Unsupported Operation on Mesh Vertices 1. I did a lot of search on this error message and all I could find was to editDelete All by Type and click on NonDeformer History. This does not work after I combined the meshes though, I get an error saying it can not be done with reference to the newly created polymesh. I tried to delete the history and then combine the meshes. that gave no error when exporting but it only saved the models nodes, no mesh at all.p  pIf I do not combine the meshes I can export to FBX and then import into my game but then I have the problem of too many draw calls and I am developing for mobile.p

I think an example will help to understand.p  pI have the main script codemain.pycode, which might look like thisp  precodeimport os import subprocess import sys  ... subprocess.call[python, script.py, arg1, arg2] ... codepre  pAnd codescript.pycode is using some functions, accessible via module os e.g. os.path.join.... p  pIs it possible to avoid codeimport oscode in codescript.pycodep
Negative 994 pI received an RSA2048 bit public key 256 bytes as a file which contains just those 256 bytes. Which function in SSL enables me to load this key as an RSA structure so I can convert it to another format This is in C code using openssl source.p  pI think its the DER format, but Im not 100 certain.p
Negative 994 pI have a Flask REST service where one POST action may take a long time for instance thirty seconds before returning an HTTP 204 No Content.p  pThe service is hosted on two servers acting as a failover, with Nginx deciding which server should be used, Nginx configuration beingp  precodeupstream demofailover      server httpdemoprimary.example.com weight1000 maxfails0     server httpdemofailover.example.com backup   server      servername demo.example.com     proxynextupstream error timeout invalidheader     proxyconnecttimeout 2     proxyredirect off     proxyreadtimeout 240s  codepre  pWhen doing the concerned POST request, Nginx transmits it to codehttpdemoprimarycode, and since it doesnt receive any response within the two seconds, abandons and does another request to codehttpdemofailovercode. Obviously, this is not suitable since the first machine is up and running, Nginx should not failover to the second machine.p  pI imagine that sending headersactually any header will do the trickfrom the service will be enough for Nginx to understand that the machine is active and that it shouldnt failover to another one.p  pI know how to do it in PHP and ASP.NET. On the other hand, the only similar thing I can find in Flask is a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.orgdocs0.10patternsstreaming relnofollowStreaming Contentsa section of the official documentation, which seems unsuitable in my case, where the response is HTTP 204.p  pHow should I flush some headers in a context where the entitybody returned by the server is emptyp

Negative 994 pI have sort of a strange question, Im just trying to see if this is possible.  p  pWhat I am looking for is a way to update the url as the user is using the app   when they click a few different items on the page I would like it to almost bind to the urlParameters I have set up. So I have like p  precode url appmod1mod2, codepre  pin my route and as the user interacts with buttons on the page, 2 of them are binded to scopes in the controllers, lets sayp  precode scope.mod1  true  scope.mod2  false codepre  pAnd then as the user interacts with them it would change the url accordingly. So if they clicked the buttons and made mod1  false and mod2  true, the url would change top  precodeappfalsetrue codepre  pHere is the catch  I would love to be able to do this without refreshing the page each time if its even possible in the first place. The idea is so that the user can then copy the url and use it later  kind of like a save state. Any advice on this matter would be much valued, as I am not sure where to look. Thank you for taking the time to readp

Negative 994 pIm working on a Java Swing application. I have a codeJTextAreacode inside a codeJScrollPanecode inside a codeJTabbedPanecode inside a codeJPanelcode.

Supposing I want to free up some space, and run that script in FUnrealProjects, which has a bit over 5060 subfolders, I would like that script to traverse all of its subfolders, check whether it contains a folder named codeBinaries, Build, Intermediatecode and delete everything in it including the folders itself it it exists.p  pIm not quite lazy to do it manually once, but when reopening some projects, they do partially or fully rebuild themselves and that eats up space since I really dont need them fully built at all times. I just need to have them archived  And build only the ones i do want to have built.p  pThanks for any help in advance guys or gals, its appreciated alot.

Negative 994 pI use the codeMPISendrecvcode MPI function to communicate arrays of data between processes. I do this in Python using mpi4py, but Im pretty sure my question is independent of the language used.p  pWhat I really want is to add an array residing on another process to an existing local array. This should be done for all processes, so I use the codeMPISendrecvcode function to send and receive the arrays in one go. I can then add the received array in the coderecvbufcode to the local array and Im done.p  pIt would be nice however if I could save the step of having a separate coderecvbufcode array, and simply receiving the data directly into the local array emwithout overwriting the existing dataem, but rather updating it using some operation addition in my case.p  pI guess what Im looking for is a combined codeMPISendrecvcodecodeMPIReducecode function. Do some function like this exist in MPIp

I just canceled it to rearrange domain names that Im working on, but Im pretty sure a whole year of Plesk was in that price range on Godaddy but I never got a download, just a login password to a cloud based thing.p  pAre you supposed to download Plesk in arrangements like that, or not Its ease of use was substantially worseat least less intuitive than my cPanel experience, and cPanel had been cloud based also.p  pI hope this question isnt rambling on too much. There are a lot of gaps in my understanding on this whole thingeven though Ive successfully put up websites beforejust didnt really understand the interface I was working with that well.p  pAnd how does that relate to FTPs Do I have to download that separately I was able to write my own htmlcss and put up a site in the past without even knowing what FTP was so Im not even sure if its something I should be manually controlling.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 994 pSorry if theres already an answer to this. I cant seem to find it.p  pIm working on an application that pulls legislators voting records on bills, and Im trying to come up with some interesting ways of visualizing the data. Theres one idea in my head right now, but Im not sure its mathematically possible to do the visualization I want to in two dimensions.p  pThe data begins like thisp  precode       HB1 HB2 HB3  Smith   1   0   1   Hill    1   1   1   Davis   0   1   0    Where 1  aye, 0  nay.   codepre  pThe next step I take is to measure the distance of each legislator from the other by summing the XORs of their voting records, so that each time one legislator disagrees with another they get a distance point with that legislator. That creates a table like thisp  precode       Smith Hill  Davis Smith    0     1     3 Hill     1     0     2 Davis    3     2     0 codepre  pSo my idea is to graph each legislator as a point on a plane, and to have the distances between those points reflect the distance rating in the table. I think it presents an interesting opportunity to see if there are clusters of legislators with similar voting patterns, etc.p  pNow, obviously, this is easy to do with 3 points since you can always draw a triangle with three given lengths for sides. But I cant figure out whether its mathematically possible to graph lots more 3570 legislators and still have all the distances right within a 2dimensional space, or whether you potentially need one additional dimension with each legislator after three.p  pSo, for example, is it possible to preserve all the distances if the data table looks like thisp  precode    0   13    6    8   10   14   12   14   12   12    13    0   13   13   13    7    9   11    9    7     6   13    0   12    8   16   14   10   12   14     8   13   12    0   12   10    6   10   10    8    10   13    8   12    0   10   12   12   14   14    14    7   16   10   10    0   10   10   12    8    12    9   14    6   12   10    0   12    8   10    14   11   10   10   12   10   12    0    8   10    12    9   12   10   14   12    8    8    0   10    12    7   14    8   14    8   10   10   10    0 codepre  pIf so, does Octave have a builtin function or can anyone point me to an algorithmp

But when I go back to enter a second song, the song1 object has the values name  null, artist  null, filesize  0, duration  0. p  pIve been at this for hours now and am really confused, any help would be amazingp  pSongDatabase class   p  precodepublic class SongDatabase   Scanner console  new ScannerSystem.in  public void addNewSong       Song song1  new Song     Song song2  new Song     Song song3  new Song     Song song4  new Song   if song1.isEmpty              System.out.printlnName of song     song1.setNameconsole.next      System.out.printlnArtist     song1.setArtistconsole.next      System.out.printlnFile size MB     song1.setFileSizeconsole.nextInt      System.out.printlnDuration seconds     song1.setDurationconsole.nextInt     System.out.printlnSong successfully added.

Negative 994 pIm new to Clojure so this could very well be an easy question.  Im having an issue with the REPL while using Leiningen.p  pPreviously, I had created an codeappcode project while following a tutorial.

Negative 994 pI have a 23 node cluster running CoreOS Stable 681.2.0 on AWS across 4 availability zones. All nodes are running etcd2 and flannel. Of the 23 nodes, 8 are dedicated etcd2 nodes, the rest are specifically designated as etcd2 proxies.p  pScheduled to the cluster are 3 nginx plus containers, a private Docker registry, SkyDNS, and 4 of our application containers. The application containers register themselves with with etcd2 and the nginx containers pick up any changes, render the necessary files, and finally reload.p  pstrongThis all works perfectly, until a singe etcd2 node is unavailable for any reason.strongp  pIf the cluster of voting etcd2 members loses connectivity to a even a single other voting etcd2 member, all of the services scheduled to the fleet become unstable. Scheduled services begin stopping and starting without my intervention.p  pAs a test, I began stopping the EC2 instances which host voting etcd2 nodes until quorum was lost. After the first etcd2 node was stopped, the above symptoms began. After a second node, services became unstable, with no observable change. Then, after the third was stopped quorum was lost and all units were unscheduled. I then started all three etcd2 nodes again and within 60 seconds the cluster had returned to a stable state.p  pSubsequent tests yield identical results.p  pAm I hitting a known bug in etcd2, fleet or CoreOSp  pIs there a setting I can modify to keep units scheduled onto a node even if etcd is unavailable for any reasonp

Im finding this strange because my impression would be that id get a not found error if something is incorrect in my controller or repository. p  pDoes anybody with experience know how something like this happens. I have an already completed example to work off of, and in that example navigating to a specific will return records only for that customer, which is what im looking to do. p  pHere is the code in my api controller, which is almost identical Im thinking there must be something subtle in the routing configs that could cause this without causing an errorp  pCustomersAPIController.csp  precodepublic class CustomersAPIController  ApiController            GET CustomersAPI      private INorthwindRepository repo      public CustomersAPIControllerINorthwindRepository repo              repo  repo           This routing doesnt work, but if it is a possible issue,     the call for a specific customer wasnt working before I added it     [RouteapiCustGetOrdersid]     public IQueryableltOrdergt GetOrdersForCustIDstring id              return repo.GetOrdersForCustIDid            [RouteapiCustGetCustomers]     public IQueryableltCustomergt GetAllCustomers              return repo.GetCustomers           [HttpGet]     [RouteapiCustGetCustomersalfki]     public Customer GetCustomerByIDstring id              Customer customer  repo.GetCustomerByIDid         return customer                    protected override void Disposebool disposing              repo.Dispose         base.Disposedisposing          codepre  pand here is my repop  prepo.csp  precodepublic interface INorthwindRepositoryIDisposable      private northwndEntities ctx  new northwndEntities       IQueryableltCustomergt GetCustomers     IQueryableltCustomergt TakeTenCustomers     Customer GetCustomerByIDstring id      IQueryableltOrdergt GetOrders     IQueryableltOrdergt GetOrdersForCustIDstring id     Order FetchOrderByIDint orderID   public class NorthwindRepository  INorthwindRepository        northwndEntities ctx  new northwndEntities       public IQueryableltCustomergt GetCustomers              return ctx.Customers.OrderByc gt c.CustomerID           public IQueryableltCustomergt TakeTenCustomers              var foo  from t in ctx.Customers                    select t.Take10         return foo            public IQueryableltOrdergt GetOrdersForCustIDstring id               var orders  ctx.Orders.Wherex gt x.CustomerID  id.OrderByDescendingxgtx.OrderDate.Take4           return orders            public Customer GetCustomerByIDstring id              return ctx.Customers.Findid           public void Dispose              ctx.Dispose       codepre  pHere is a link to a screenshot of the url in my example to work off of, working as intended and returning the records for a specific ID a hrefhttppostimg.orgimageoup88k83f relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimageoup88k83fap  pIn this second one, it is a link to my api that I have been basing on my example to work from. a hrefhttppostimg.orgimage858t1oph9 relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimage858t1oph9ap  pAs mentioned above, the code is nearly identical, except for some small changes to the routing and maybe the api controller names.p  pIf anyone has any idea what is causing this, all suggestions are appreciated.

Negative 994 pI asked similar question yesterday but get no answers which will help me to solve the problem. Im noob in coding so please dont judge me I have wordpress theme with rail gallery . It was working like max image height was 900 and on 13,15 inch displays it was fine but on 24, 27 displays the pictures are looking really small ,so I decided to change image sizes. First of all I deleted from functions.php code lines which was controlling resize options for gallery like max height and width was 900x600. Now I have fullsize pictures like max height 1500px and its fine for big displays I think. So I have gallery block with paddings on top and bottom and pictures inside them, but they are cropped to the div size and I want just to make this images automatically resizing to the div block heightdiv block height is resizing by display size I will give my site url to understand what I have and will give the example website of what I want to get . strongTHIS IS WHAT I HAVEstrong a hrefhttpwww.arnoldpiscel.comstorybook relnofollowMY WEBSITEa and what strongI want to havestrong a hrefhttpwww.chantamakeup.com relnofollowWEBSITE WITH PROPER GALLERYa .

In the real world, those numbers are much more random so firebase treats them as an object since they arent ordered. p 2 For some reason, Intellij wasnt showing the Children objects contents. I had to type in something like data.val.Children[3] to get a value or something like forvar property in data.val.Children to iterate through the fields.  Weird. p 3 I bSTILLb cant do .childitems.orderByChildChildren ... since that returns all records.  Oddly enough, however, it returns the ones that have Children first.p
