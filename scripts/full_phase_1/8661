There are likely many other employee endpoints besides roles.p  pUsing Jersey I split this up into a root resource with several subresources, for examplep  precodePathemployees public class EmployeesResource      ...     GET     PathemployeeIdroles     public RolesResource getRolesPathParamemployeeId long employeeId          return new RolesResourceemployeeId       codepre  pThis produces the desired JSON result when I GET codeemployeescode and codeemployees1code but when I GET codeemployees1rolescode I get the response bodyp  precode     roles [                      id 20,             responsibility 1000         ,         ...     ]  codepre  pJersey has wrapped my collection of Role representations in some object. Note The object seems to be connected to the name of the subresource resource method within RolesResource for example, if the method is named codegetRolescode I get coderoles [...]code, if the method is named codegetFoocode I get codefoo [...]code.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong There must be a reason Jersey does this. Why would I want my representation to be wrapped like this And if there isnt a good reason, how can I get rid of thisp  pEdit Im using Dropwizard version 0.8.2, which it looks like a hrefhttpmvnrepository.comartifactio.dropwizarddropwizardjersey0.8.2 relnofollowfrom mavena is pulling in Jersey 2.19. It uses Jackson as the JSON provider  again, from maven it looks like the version is 2.5.1. No web.xml as this is a dropwizard application.p

Positive 8661 pIs it considered bad practice to design a REST API that may have an ambiguity in the path resolution  For examplep  precodeGET animalsid    Returns the animal with the given ID GET animalsdogs    Returns all animals of type dog codepre  pOk, thats contrived, because you would actually just do codeGET dogscode, but hopefully it illustrates what I mean.  From a path resolution standpoint, it seems like you wouldnt know whether you were looking for an animal with codeiddogscode or just all the codedogscodep  pSpecifically, Im interested in whether Jersey would have any trouble resolving this.  What if you knew the codeidcode to be an integerp

Positive 8661 pUsing the default REST implementation Jersey codecom.sun.jersey.spi.spring.container.servlet.SpringServletcode along with Spring running inside Jetty, a data source problem emerged.p  pA custom data source manager based on Hikari is used and the JdbcTemplate is fetched directly from the manager bypassing Jetty and Jersey. This leaves the transaction management entirely to the application and the developer. Since this is an unnecessary burden and an unnecessary  source of various hard to spot defects, it would be nice to hand over the transactional integration to the container JettyJersey and Spring.p  pWhat would be the best configuration option availablep
Positive 8661 pI am currently working on a RESTeasy based RESTful service. I have a filter class which serves as a server request filter as well as a server response filter i.e. it implements codeContainerRequestFiltercode and codeContainerResponseFiltercode interfaces. p  pAt the beginning of the request, I use the filter to put an object into codeThreadLocalcode. This object is used by the resources throughout the request. At the end of the request, before sending out the response, the filter removes the object from codeThreadLocalcode.p  pMy question is that is there a guarantee that the the request filter, the resource and the response filter will all execute in the same thread Is there a possibility that after the request filter puts the object into codeThreadLocalcode, a different thread will execute the request and thus not have access to the objectp  pI was sure that this was the case but then I saw this a hrefhttpjersey.576304.n2.nabble.comDoesfiltermethodofContainerRequestFilterruninresourcemethodthreadtd7582648.html relnofollowhttpjersey.576304.n2.nabble.comDoesfiltermethodofContainerRequestFilterruninresourcemethodthreadtd7582648.htmla official Jersey forum and now I have doubts.p

Positive 8661 pI have a RESTful Java backend with Jersey. The thing is that I dont know how to implement authorization for the methods. I mean how do I check a user is authorized to use a given method of my REST APIp  pOf course if I look for Jersey authorization, I have those nice annotations like RolesAllowed, PermitAll and DenyAll. However those annotations act against the server realm, with the users of the server, nothing to do with your application users that you store in the database.p  pSo for the sake authorization, what should I do I define a filter that checks if the user is logged in in my application I have to apply the filter to the REST endpoints that need authenticationp  pThis seems a bit like the old days, thats why Im asking the better way to do it.p
Positive 8661 pI am pretty new to the REST world and we are trying our hands at migrating our application to a REST based architecture. We are working on a proof of concept and we need to come up with a working proof that what we are set to achieve can be done using REST. p  pIn our architecture, the front end screens would use Angular and would call REST services to open up a customer session and performmaintain transactions within that session and when the session is complete, the session details i.e. all the customer transactions within the customer session would be sent over for commit to the DB. We only want to write to the DB after customer completes all transactions within a session. In other words, a commit to the DB happens only when the session ends.p  pI am hoping to get some directions on how best to perform the below steps in our Java classes.p  p1 Browser initiates a request to open a new customer session. A session POST service is used to generate a new session ID. The session ID is sent back as response to the browser. p  pstrongQuestion strong emWhat is the best way to maintain this session ID value in my Java classesemp  p2 Customer transactions are performed within the session. For each transaction processed a transaction POST service is used to save the transaction information along with the session information. p  pstrongQuestion strong emIn my Java classes what is the best way to maintain this transaction information and how best do I associate this transaction information with the session information that was created by the previous session POST information The client would maintain the session ID but on the service side I need to be able to map the transaction with the session ID so that I can send back a combined session payload that includes session information and the transaction within that session.emp  p3 A customer can perform some more transactions and each transaction performed would be a transaction POST request which would have to get associated with the session id created before. Each additional transaction performed would have to be associated to the session id on the service side such that when I do a GET on the session id, I need to get the session details along with all transactions within that session.p  p4 Finally when the session is complete the information from the session and the session payload on the service side along with all the transactions will commit to the DB.p  pI am just looking for some general guidance on how best to do this using my Java classes and Jersey REST. p  pAny pointers would be appreciated.p  pThanks Ali.p

Positive 8661 pUsing mule 3.7 with a RESTful application and a design which calls for using dynamic links.

Negative 8661 pIm kind of curious how I should approach a problem with iPhones and communication between two phones.p  pI have an idea for an application that needs to send data between two known phones. The problem is that the data could be very small or very large. I want to have intermediate storage on a server and a messaging layer, but I want there to be performant means to communicate between devices for shorter, unimportant messages.p  pYou always hear about networking and client to client communication with popular platforms and protocols, but Im curious what peoples thoughts are on doing p2p style communication with an iPhone.p  pIm pretty sure it should and can be treated as just a simple addressable machine... so I would have to build NAT traversing network code into the iPhone itself. A thought I had would be some sort of UPnP situation where I would ask to NAT a particular port for communication to the devices... but I guess I could just as easily turn it into a polling situation. p  pGranted, I understand that Apple will have a push mechanism for developers eventually but I want to get the app out the door before hand...p  pJust curious about thoughts on this type of thing... any thoughts on multiplayer game situations would also directly apply to and benefit from this question.p
Negative 8661 pI have a project with Crystal Reports files that doesnt seem to build correctly if I upgrade it to VS 2005 and .NET 2.0.

Since I am now running Vista, and .NET 2003 doesnt work correctly on Vista, I want to be able to build using MSBuild to target the .NET 1.1 framework.  Is this possiblep

But because the onconfirm is called outside of the scope of the for loop, the counter value is no longer valid because its been incremented. I need some way to pass the counter value to the dialog onconfirm as it was at the time the dialog was displayed, not after the loop has finished. Or maybe someone has a better solution.

In Core Data I have two entities set up, one of them containing members of the other, larger grouping e.g. codecarscode and codemanufacturerscode.  Ive got entry pages set up for each entity and they play nicely there no faulting when trying to select from a manytoone in a drop menu.  What Im trying to do now is take that one step further so that when I select a codemanufacturercode in the main codeNSTableViewcode, the list of codecarscode related to that codemanufacuturercode will appear in the second codeNSTableViewcode.p  pIve tried using bindings similar to what Ive done for the codemanufacturercode popup button, feeding the value from the codecarscode entity, however its simply showing a list of all the codecarcode entries, regardless of which codemanufacturercode I select.  I dont see any options for a predicate to filter it, however, and if I set the bindings key path to codemanufacturer.carscode, it shows a relationship fault.  How can I filter what gets displayed in the child tablep

Negative 8661 pWe have a system that uses codespgetapplockcode to create an exclusive mutex any time someone opens an order in the GUI. This is used to prevent multiple people from making changes to an order simultaneously.p  pSometimes people will open an order and go home, leaving it open.

Negative 8661 pI have a groupby query that is very fast when it comes to indexing, joining, sending the results etc. Unfortunately, mysql spends 99.6 of its time copying to tmp table when I profile it. I am at a loss as to how I can get mysql to perform better on its own.p  pThis group by query essentially finds the number of entities for the top 20 tags in the system. I build on this query to filter out tags that the user selects, essentially narrowing down the field. As they select a new tag, the query performance improves drastically. If they select 2 or 3 tags, the query is extremely fast in finding the number of entities with those 2 or 3 tags, plus the next most popular tags after that.p  pEssentially, the performance problem is when no tags are selected, or when 1 tag is selected.

This seems like a simple task in PHP, but what happens when you have like 10 people trying to unsubscribe at once, and 10 new subscribers being added Thats where I think PHP might run into trouble and an error might be generated due to a file lock, unless Linux or PHP is more capable than I think.p  pNote my client wants a CSV file, not a database table. In a database table, this would not be a problem, but as file IO, I might run into a potential issue, rightp  pBTW, to prevent identity theft, I use an .htaccess trick so that one cant download the CSV over the web by guessing its name  it must only be accessed either by my PHP script or by FTP.p

Negative 8661 pI need to request a service for data. After the request Ill use that data to draw a few shapes representing the data. p  pMy question is if its a preferred way to draw like a library of assets in XAML first, and then use code to copy and place these predefined assets around based on the imported data  strongemOremstrong if its cleaner to go a codeonly approach and also create the XAML objects using code after reading the datap  pThe object are quite simple and were not depending on a separate designer to create the XAML. I guess that otherwise could be a reason for predefine the XAML object.p

Negative 8661 pSo far ive been using tomcat and glassfish to develop a testing webapp, without maven. And the usual developmenttilldeploy cycle is simple p  ol lipdevelop in eclipse ide, with a WebContent folder, which is the root webapp folder that has the WEBINF, web.xml, WEBINFlib, n all. The compiled classes location in eclipse is set to WEBINFclasses.pli lipafter coding, i could just click on the reload button in glassfish admin console for that specific webapp. In tomcat, i believe its reload also in the tomcat manager.pli lipi could access the web application in the browserpli ol  pNow if i would like to create a new webapp, thatll make use of latest stuffs of jsf, spring, jpa, hibernate, postgresql p  ol lipwhat recommendation of archetype should i use in the creation of the project pli lipcan i still use my previous steps of development because i think its very easy without having to repackage everything into a war file, or copying it into the tomcats webapp folder everytime i want to test. Saving the files in eclipse, hit on the reload in the admin console  tomcat manager, and i could instantly test the updated webapp.pli ol  pOr what do you usually do in the webapp development cycle  Please share your experiences, p  pThank you p

Negative 8661 pAloha again, stackoverflow.p  pIm experiencing a bit of an interesting situation here. I was previously using a setup that used a tab panel in order to display all of my content, but now, Im rewriting it to be inside of a viewport. Now, its working just fine, except, all my forms, which are located in the Tab panel, are not having any of the buttons showing up in them. Anyone have any idea why that might be happening If you need any more specifics, please ask, as Id be more than happy to provide them, but I cant provide anything more if Im not sure what you need. p

Negative 8661 pEvidently there is this high quality KDE algorithm that is used in the computer graphics industry, but everyone Ive asked refuse to tell me what it is.  Ive implemented a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKerneldensityestimation relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKerneldensityestimationa , but noise is still a big problem.  Ive seen renderings of this high quality KDE and the outputs are far more superior than the ones you get from the KDE algorithm described on wikipedia.  Does anyone know what this highly secretive KDE algorithm is p  pAn example of a variation of the standard KDE in use is the flam3 program, which is a fractal flame rendering and animation program.  Problem with flam3 is that its rendered images contain noise.  Chaotica, another fractal flame rendering program, uses this higher quality KDE algorithm to eliminate noise and thus produces much higher quality renders.  Chaotica isnt open source, but it implements the same fractal flame algorithm which requires a density estimation algorithm.  Also, the author of Chaotica has stated that it uses a different KDE that is used in the computer graphics industry.  p

Negative 8661 pI need to write a small application in CC to implement a panel task bar like thing to display information along the top of a desktop window specifically an xorg desktop on a Linux system. I need to avoid bloat and steep learning curves for the GUI programming.p  pMy research is pointing me at GTKGTKmm or FLTK. It looks like FLTK is probably the simpler to get to grips with and the most likely to provide a small clean package with minimal dependencies. So Ive based my research on FLTK so far.p  pIve been doing some reading and am struggling to find out how to write a basic program that will create a narrow undecorated window that covers the width of a monitor in such a way that maximising other applications would not obscure it. The FLTK tutorials I have found so far including the FLTK documentation only implement standard windows with borders that can be moved around the screen.p  pId like to start by writing a simple program in FLTK or GTKGTKmm that creates a 20 pixel deep bar across the with of the screen containing a hello world message. The bars area would be reserved outside the area that other programs can access so that maximising another application would not hide the hello world message. I think this has something to do with a WMSTRUTPARTIAL property but I cant find information about this in FLTK.p  pDoing this is partially to understand how to write a simple GUI program and partially to solve a specific need that I have.p  pIm looking for any helpguidance to put me in the right direction to get started. Many thanks.p

Negative 8661 pThe below text is an effort to expand and add color to this questionp  pHow do I prevent a misbehaving client from taking down the entire servicep  pI have essentially this scenario a WCF service is up and running with a client callback having a straight forward, simple oneway communication, not very different from this onep  precodepublic interface IMyClientContract    [OperationContractIsOneWay  true]   void SomethingChangedsimpleObject myObj  codepre  pIm calling this method potentially thousands of times a second from the service to what will eventually be about 50 concurrently connected clients, with as low latency as possible lt15 ms would be nice.  This works fine until I set a break point on emoneem of the client apps connected to the server and then everything hangs  after maybe 25 seconds the service hangs and none of the other clients receive any data for about 30 seconds or so until the service registers a connection fault event and disconnects the offending client.  After this all the other clients continue on their merry way receiving messages.p  pIve done research on serviceThrottling, concurrency tweaking, setting threadpool minimum threads, WCF secret sauces and the whole 9 yards, but at the end of the day this article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163537.aspxS10MSDN  WCF essentials, OneWay Calls, Callbacks and Eventsa  describes exactly the issue Im having without really making a recommendation.p  blockquote   pThe third solution that allows the service to safely call back to the client is to have the callback contract operations configured as oneway operations. Doing so enables the service to call back even when concurrency is set to singlethreaded, because there will not be any reply message to contend for the lock.p blockquote  pbut earlier in the article it describes the issue Im seeing, only from a client perspectivep  blockquote   pWhen oneway calls reach the service, they may not be dispatched all at once and may be queued up on the service side to be dispatched one at a time, all according to the service configured concurrency mode behavior and session mode. How many messages whether oneway or requestreply the service is willing to queue up is a product of the configured channel and the reliability mode. If the number of queued messages has exceeded the queues capacity, then the client will block, even when issuing a oneway callp blockquote  pI can only assume that the reverse is true, the number of queued messages to the client has exceeded the queue capacity and the threadpool is now filled with threads attempting to call this client that are now all blocked.p  pWhat is the right way to handle this Should I research a way to check how many messages are queued at the service communication layer per client and abort their connections after a certain limit is reached p  pIt almost seems that if the WCF service itself is blocking on a queue filling up then all the async  oneway  fireandforget strategies I could ever implement inside the service will still get blocked whenever one clients queue gets full.p

Essentially what is supposed to happen is the resize event tells two divs to not show, and changes another div to visible.

However, the end result is fine, I can load what I need very quickly. This is using v6 save.p  pMethod 2 If I save all of the files in one .mat file and then load just the variables I need, access is very slow loading takes around three quarters of the time it takes to load the whole file, with small variation depending on the ordering of the save. This is using v6 save, too.p  pI know I could split the files up into many folders but it seems like such a nasty hack and wont fix the SSDs dislike of writing many small files, is there a better way p  pEdit The objects are consist mainly of a numeric matrix of double data and an accompanying vector of uint32 identifiers, plus a bunch of small identifying properties char and numeric.p

Negative 8661 pI have a pretty basic question regarding JNI calls to Java in Android NDK. I have no problems with making the actual calls, but I am not sure whether the Java call is blocked or not when it is called from C. My question is specifically whether the c call blocks while the Java method is executed, or if it returns immediately. The reason I am asking is that I pass a byteArray to Java and I wonder if Java has access to it after the call is initiated. p

Negative 8661 pIm working on an iOS flashcard style learning app that, on load, needs to grab a bunch of data from Core Data. But the data I need is a fairly specific subset of the entity, based on user settings, so there are multiple predicates involved testing equivalence. Im finding these fetches are super slow and, based on research on SQLite, I think an index would be a good choice here.p  pNow, I understand largely from reading other stackoverflow questions that SQLite and Core Data are two different, basically orthogonal things that should not be confused. But its also my understanding that youre supposed to work through Core Data to do any sort of database work and tweaking you shouldnt try to bypass and work directly with SQLite when optimizing or designing object permanence in your app.p  pBut the only thing I can find for indexes in Core Data is that one indexed checkbox for each attribute in a model. And thats just not doing the sort of optimization Im looking for.p  pHeres the fetch request, currentlyp  precodeNSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameSKUserItem inManagedObjectContextcontext] fetchRequest.entity  entity  NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptor  [[[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeynext ascendingYES] autorelease] fetchRequest.sortDescriptors  [NSArray arrayWithObjectsortDescriptor]  NSMutableArray predicates  [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity6] [predicates addObject[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatnext lt f, now  60.060.024.0]] [predicates addObject[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatnext gt f, nextOffset]] [predicates addObject[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatuser  , user]] [predicates addObject[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatlangRaw  d, lang]]  NSArray stylePredicates  [NSArray arrayWithObjects[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatstyleRaw  d, SKSIMPANDTRAD], [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatstyleRaw  d, self.style], nil] [predicates addObject[NSCompoundPredicate orPredicateWithSubpredicatesstylePredicates]]  if[self.parts count]  4  self.lang  SKJA ampamp [self.parts count]  3        dont have to filter by parts theyre studying all of them else      NSMutableArray partPredicates  [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity[self.parts count]]     forNSString part in self.parts         [partPredicates addObject[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatpartRaw  d, partCodepart]]     [predicates addObject[NSCompoundPredicate orPredicateWithSubpredicatespartPredicates]]   NSPredicate compoundPredicate  [NSCompoundPredicate andPredicateWithSubpredicatespredicates] fetchRequest.predicate  compoundPredicate codepre  pSo essentially what this fetch does is sort by next the time when the given item is due and filter for username, language being studied, the style being studied in Chinese theres simplified and traditional and the parts being studied writing, tone, reading, or definition, and only fetching within a next range. Heres a short list of things Ive learned from tweaking and fiddling with thisp  ol liIt always scans the whole table, or seems to. Though next is indexed, even if I force it to search a range which I know will return nothing, it still takes several seconds for the fetch to complete.li liThe predicates, any number of predicates, makes this slow. If I remove some but not all, its about as slow. If I remove all predicates thus breaking the app then its much faster.li liThe speed is heavily dependent on how many UserItems there are total in the table. The more items there are, the slower this is. Some people can have tens of thousands of items, and thats when this fetch can take as much as 10 seconds to complete. This is leading to awkward pauses in my app.li liThe upper bound on the next value was added not because we need it, but because it speeds up the fetch a little bit.li liHaving the query return a subset of the properties in a dictionary rather than an entire managed object and fetching the rest lazily is faster, but still not faster enough.li ol  pIm coming from Google App Engine here, so Im used to the indexes they provide there. Essentially I want that sort of index, but applied to SQLite through Core Data. I found information on adding indexes in SQLite, the kind I would want, but doing this sort of indexing through Core Data, I cant find any information on that.p

Negative 8661 pI need to build two branded versions of my WIX based installer. The only difference between the the versions is a single bitmap containing the company contact details. Id like to keep a single WIX project so I have less projects to maintain. Im using an environment variable to alter which bitmap is inserted into the installerp  precodeSourceenv.CompanyName contact.png codepre  pThis works fine, however I cannot change the environment variable from within VS2010. VS2010 is compiling the WIX installers using the environment variables that were set when VS2010 started. I have to restart VS2010 to get it to pick up the new environment variable value.p  pI have 36 nested projects so I dont want to have to set the build variables within each project  thats why Im trying to use an environment variable.p  pDoes anyone know how to change one of the environment variables used by the current VS2010 instance Or perhaps there is a better wayp

Negative 8661 pIm a pretty junior level developer first year CS student and Ive been learning about the differences between static typed and dynamically typed languages. Correct me if Im wrong, but its my understanding that a dynamically typed language allows the programmer to initialize a variable without giving it a type, then give that variable a type later in the program. Just for the sake of curiosity, is there any languages out there that allow you to change the typeclass of the object without initializing a brand new variable p

Negative 8661 pIm very new to Memory Mapped Files, and Im a little lost on something.p  pI know that if I had a file, I could load it and access it from various processes at once using MMaps.p  pBut in my situation, Im creating a DLL attached to Process A, and that DLL has been given a pointer to a cSurface which Process A has prepared. I need to share that cSurfaces data with Process B. I really dont want to have to call up a blank MMap and copy my Process As surface into it, only to copy it out again in process B.p  pIs it possible to map my surface as if it were a file so the MMap already points to the surface data when its created as it would were I loading SomeTextFile.txtp  pMy plan, in theory, would be to receive a pointer to the surface in Proc A, tell windows to share that surfaces memory with a given name, and use Mutexes to coordinate access  the idea being that both processes read the same physical copy of the surface with no cumbersome copying.p  pIs that possiblep
Negative 8661 pAlright here is what I am attempting to do.  I have a form written in HTML.  It has a few HTML5 elements to it though.  What I would like to happen, is when the user fills out all the required fields validated with PHP and some HTML5 and submits the form, it will export to an existing XML file.  The form also uses AJAX to validate as the user fills out the fields, and to validate the form as a whole once submitted without reloading my page.p  pThe XML file is just a framework of empty tags set up to receive the information from form submissions, built upon a schema I made to restrict it to certain values and what not. I would also need to be able to have a script to validate the new XML values against the schema to make sure all values are valid, and if not return an error message. p  pThe XML Schema validation is as close as possible to the PHP validation with a few character amount limits added in here and there.p  pIf you need me to post the schema for the XML file in order to give a more specific answer then I will upon request.p  pbXML Frameworkbp  precode    ltformgt lt First Name gt     ltfnamegtltfnamegt  lt Last Name gt     ltlnamegtltlnamegt  lt Phone Number gt     ltphonegtltphonegt  lt Email gt     ltemailgtltemailgt  lt Website gt     ltwebsitegtltwebsitegt  lt Subject gt     ltsubjectgtltsubjectgt  lt Message gt     ltmessagegtltmessagegt  ltformgt codepre  pbHTML Formbp  precodeltform methodpost actionphpvalidator.php namecontactform idcontactform autocompleteongt       ltfieldsetgt           ltlegendgtContact Detailsltlegendgt           ltdivgt              ltlabel forfname accesskeyFgtYour First Nameltlabelgt             ltinput namefname typetext idname placeholderEnter your first name tabindex1 required gt          ltdivgt          ltdivgt              ltlabel forlname accesskeyLgtYour Last Nameltlabelgt             ltinput namelname typetext idname placeholderEnter your last name tabindex2 required gt          ltdivgt           ltdivgt              ltlabel foremail accesskeyEgtEmailltlabelgt              ltinput nameemail typeemail idemail placeholdermyEmailexample.com pattern[AZaz09][.][azAZ09][AZaz09][.][azAZ09].[AZaz]2, tabindex3 required gt          ltdivgt           ltdivgt              ltlabel forphone accesskeyPgtPhone ltsmallgtoptionalltsmallgtltlabelgt              ltinput namephone typetel idphone size12 placeholder5555555555 tabindex4 gt          ltdivgt           ltdivgt              ltlabel forwebsite accesskeyWgtWebsite ltsmallgtoptionalltsmallgtltlabelgt              ltinput namewebsite typeurl idwebsite placeholderwww.yourWebDomain.com tabindex5 gt          ltdivgt       ltfieldsetgt       ltfieldsetgt           ltlegendgtYour Commentsltlegendgt           ltdivgt              ltlabel forsubject accesskeySgtSubjectltlabelgt              ltselect namesubject idsubject tabindex6 requiredrequiredgt                  ltoption valuegtltoptiongt                  ltoption valueSupportgtSupportltoptiongt                  ltoption valueSalegtSalesltoptiongt                  ltoption valueBuggtReport a bugltoptiongt                 ltoption valueOthergtOtherltoptiongt             ltselectgt         ltdivgt         ltdivgt              ltlabel forcomments accesskeyCgtCommentsltlabelgt             lttextarea namecomments cols40 rows3 idcomments classcomments placeholderEnter your comments spellchecktrue required tabindex7gtlttextareagt          ltdivgt       ltfieldsetgt      ltinput typesubmit classsubmit idsubmit valueSubmit tabindex9 gt ltformgt codepre

Negative 8661 pIn my Phone 7 app, Im currently using the Silverlight Toolkits transition service to implement transition animations when the user navigates between pages. Its working. But I dont like these animations because they always consist of two phases the first phase shows an animation between the current page and the background, and the second one an animation between the background and the next page. It seems that most Phone 7 applications have this kind of animations.p  pWhat I would like to have instead is a direct animation from one page to another so that during the animation parts of both pages are visible. For a slide animation for example, the old page would move to the left and directly reveal the new page underneath. During the animation, the screen is split the left part show less and less of the old page while the right part shows more and more of the new page.p  pHow can I achieve that Is a Silverlight storyboard able to do this p

Negative 8661 pIm a newbie Android programmer, and Ive been assigned to create an activity that displays table of changes made to the app by version.  The table has four columns, Id, Type, Description, and Version. p  pTo do this, I placed a TableLayout in a scrollView.  Then, I have a template for the TableRows, that are inflated dynamically at Runtime.  The column widths should stay static they can overflow in height but not width. p  pTo achieve this, I tried using the weight amp weightsum property of the column and row container respectively.  I have set the layoutwidth to zero on both. p  pThe problem is that the columns are expanding outside the screen boundaries.  I would post the images but I dont have the authority. p  pLandscape looks close but you can see that the outer boundry is still being  cut off. p  pI noticed that in if the weights of the children add to about 45 of the total then the weighting comes close to looking right. p  pFinally, the views separating the columns have been given a weight of zero, and 1dip width. Im not sure if that could be causing a problem. p  pAny advice  p  pTo me it looks like that weighting is using the width as if it was in landscape mode.  Do I have to make two layouts, one for portrait, and one for landscape p  pIve added the xml layout for the table row p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltTableRow xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt      ltLinearLayout         androidididtablerowcontainer         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidorientationvertical gt          ltView             androidididtopborder             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheight1dip             androidbackgroundFFFFFF gt          ltLinearLayout             androidididhorizontalcontainer             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidweightSum4 gt              ltView                 androidididview1                 androidlayoutwidth1dip                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidbackgroundFFFFFF androidlayoutweight0.01gt              ltTextView                 androidididtxtid                 androidlayoutwidth0dip                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextId androidtextSize10sp androidlayoutweight0.5gt              ltView                 androidididview2                 androidlayoutwidth1dip                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidbackgroundFFFFFF androidlayoutweight0.01gt              ltTextView                 androidididtxttype                 androidlayoutwidth0dip                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextType androidtextSize10sp androidlayoutweight1gt              ltView                 androidididview3                 androidlayoutwidth1dip                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidbackgroundFFFFFF androidlayoutweight0.01gt              ltTextView                 androidididtxtdesc                 androidlayoutwidth0dip                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextDescription androidtextSize10sp androidlayoutweight2gt              ltView                 androidididview4                 androidlayoutwidth1dip                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidbackgroundFFFFFF androidlayoutweight0.01gt              ltTextView                 androidididtxtversion                 androidlayoutwidth0dip                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextVersion androidtextSize10sp androidlayoutweight0.5gt              ltView                 androidididview6                 androidlayoutwidth1dip                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidbackgroundFFFFFF androidlayoutweight0.01gt         ltLinearLayoutgt          ltView             androidididview7             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheight1dip androidbackgroundFFFFFFgt      ltLinearLayoutgt  ltTableRowgt codepre  pThe upper and lower view are top and bottom borders. p  pAnd here is the layout for the table that its getting added toop  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent     androidorientationvertical androidscrollbarAlwaysDrawVerticalTracktruegt      ltScrollView         androidididviewscroll         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidfillViewporttruegt          ltTableLayout             androidididtablelayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidorientationvertical             androidshrinkColumns0             androidstretchColumns0 gt         ltTableLayoutgt      ltScrollViewgt  ltLinearLayoutgt  codepre

When I fetch Organization Objectify strongautomaticallystrong fetches child Person.  Also I created two methods in my service layer codefindOrganizationByIdcode and codesaveOrganizationcode that load and persist objects.p  pNow consider two scenariosp  pWhen I call codefindOrganizationByIdcode in the client following calls occur on server sidep  precodeOrderDao.findOrganizationById1 PojoLocator.getIdKeyltgtOrganization1 PojoLocator.getIdKeyltgtOrganization1Person2 PojoLocator.getIdKeyltgtOrganization1 PojoLocator.findKeyltgtOrganization1 PojoLocator.getIdKeyltgtOrganization1Person2 PojoLocator.findKeyltgtOrganization1Person2 codepre  pBy calling codeOrderDao.findOrganizationByIdcode Ive already received full graph of objects. Why call code.findcode twice in addition to that Its extra load on Datastore that cost me money. Of course I cache it but it would be neat to fix it. How can I avoid these additional calls p  pSimilar thing happens when I save objects by calling codesaveOrganizationcode in the client. Following calls occur on server sidep  precodePojoLocator.findKeyltgtOrganization1 PojoLocator.findKeyltgtOrganization1Person2 OrderDao.saveOrganization1 PojoLocator.getIdKeyltgtOrganization1 PojoLocator.findKeyltgtOrganization1 PojoLocator.getIdKeyltgtOrganization1Person2 PojoLocator.findKeyltgtOrganization1Person2 codepre  pI can understand need for fetching two objects from DataStore strongbeforestrong updating it. RequestFactory sends deltas to the server so it needs to have entire object before persisting it.

Negative 8661 pi am using Google Fusion Tables and Google Maps to display geographical data e.g. markers. My map needs to have a legend, for example by inserting a div on top of the map and the layer. As i am not used to work with API of any kind, i got stuck with this legend problem. p  pI tried several example codes most of them provided by google, but none worked for me. I guess that the problem of displaying divs on a map has got something to do with either the styling of the map canvas, the div implementation within the body of the html document or with the framework used google appengine. But this is just guessing. As i am not a professional with coding, i maybe missed a important point. Maybe the folks here can help me out  Every hint is appreciated.

Negative 8661 pI was wondering if anyone could provide some suggestions on how to make sorted set generation more efficientp  pI am working on a project where ranking data is calculated on an hourly basis and stored in a database.

Then using Redis only return sorted set values based on the user defined filters. e.g. only get rankings for males from Australia.p  pIs this possible to do natively in Redisp

But I still dont understand some fundamental characteristics of Racket Scheme.p  ol lipWhy are there no real variables Why is everything a function in RacketScheme Why did the language designers not include thempli lipWhat is codedefinestructcode Is it a function Is it a class I somehow, because of my PHP background, always think its a class, but that cant be really correct.pli ol  pMy question here is I want to understand the concept of the language.

Negative 8661 pI am currently using a javascript table script called tableFilter, which works for the purpose I originally needed which was simply displaying data with the ability to filter and sort. Now I need one more function which is the ability to swap rows and save the new order to the mysql table. For example if the table is books, and the list of books is shown with a column rank and the grid is sorted on rank, if the user swaps 2 rows I want the new rank of the swapped rows to get saved to the mysql table. I looked a jqGrid and I like the look and functionality of the grid, but I do not see how they would change the rank in the grid and then save it to the database.

Negative 8661 pIt has been a nice run of about 7 or 8 years now that we have developed Flash browser based games for the web exclusively.

Clients are starting to demand, almost assume, that games will work in the browser  on the desktop and on their tablets.p  pPutting aside the whole discussion of using an HTML5JS solution instead, were sticking with Flash for the next project and need to figure out the best way to get it to run on the desktop browser strongandstrong on the iPad, while maximizing code reuse.p  pGiven the current state of technologies today, what is the best path This game will be a 2D sidescroller type game with some physics, and development will be done mainly with bitmap graphics as opposed to vector and spritesheets. p  pHere are what I understand to be my optionsp  pOption 1 Develop the game targeting the standard flash player for web 11 or higher, then port to an iOS AIR 3.2 app, doing appropriate optimizations like the ones a hrefhttpsierakowski.eulistoftips82startingwithairforandroidandiosbuildingoneappforbothplatforms.html relnofollowoutlined herea. p  pOption 2 Use StarlingStage3D for desktop, and then port to an iPad app. Just wondering if starling is ready for primetime making production quality games for mobile  desktop. Does Stage3D still work well enough in software mode on older machinesp  pOption 3 The new feature in CS6 that lets us publish to HTML5. Is this even close to mature enough to publish a full game The benefit of this solution is that it could run in the browser on the iPad instead of being a separate app.p  pThianks so much for any guidance.. Im also wondering about pitfalls, and optimization techniques involved in any of these. But it seems the underlying question in all this is should we use StarlingStage3D or notp

Negative 8661 pRecently few days I run into a weird problem of php not able to connect to mysql on RDS, while manual connections are fine.p  pSo I have several php scripts sitting on our server which is hosted on EC2, and these scripts are called by the clients to communicate with a mysql server sitting on RDS. The scripts are setup so that if any connection error occurs, they would send email notification to me. p  pSo for the recent few days Im receiving thousands of error emails from my scripts, at the first few days the errors were simple saying the server host is not recognized, but I am sure the address is correct. And now the errors are almost all saying Host XXX is blocked because of many connection errors, unblock with mysqladmin flushhosts... If I flush the hosts, the errors come back to me after a while.p  pWhat confuses me the most is that, I cannot reproduce the problem I tried connecting to the RDS server from my EC2 server through command line and through test php scripts... They all work If I manually invoke the scripts sending me error emails, they work too Looking at the RDS monitor, all stat looks normal, CPU is bouncing around 50, and plenty of hard drive space.p  pSo Im totally confused right now... Can anyone provide me some insight about how to solve this problem I dont even know where to look at now...p

Negative 8661 pI am still learning PHP so my question may seem a little obvious but...p  pMy question relates to opencart but is probably quite a common practice on many websites. I am creating a opencart module and in that module i have several buttons that complete different tasks.

I could put something information in the link, ie actiondosomething and do it this way but most of opencart simply uses the text of the last  as the action. If I use the href stated above I get a error as it is trying to find the controller and template located in modulemodulenamedosomething rather than the controller and template located in modulemodulename USING the function dosomething.p  pI hope this makes sense. I see that many other scripts in opencart successfully use this method but I just cant figure out how I am sure I missing something obvious.p

Its not just an automatically retrieved route between two points, but a customized one, with as many points as I needed to force a route or circuit.p  pI can create the route and I will right on google maps website, and then store the url to render the same map in my website. p  pOr is there a better way to store a static custom route it will be stored once, and never changed, just rendered, so no need for a dynamic route generatorp

Negative 8661 pWhat would be the preferred way to handle internal modules within a node.js applicationp  pI mean, currently we have a fairly big application and there are several dependencies, installed via npm. We have codenodemodulescode in code.gitignorecode. Therefore its not in the repository. We use codenpm shrinkwrapcode to freeze the modules versions, so, upon deployment, an codenpm installcode puts together eveything we need into codenodemodulescode.p  pThe problem is, since out app is getting bigger, we want to split it to smaller modules. Now, if I create a codefoocode module and put it in codenodemoduescode, I need to allow it in the repo, which does not seem so neat to have both ignored and checked out modules in codenodemodulescode.p  pWe can not publish these on npm registry because they are not really public.p  pIs there any obvious solution that Im not aware ofp

If you test this flow you will see that the rest of the fields after the exception wont get processed i.e. logged in this case. In this particulare example, the catch exception stragegy wont even fire.p  pInput Filep  prehello,cruel,world goodbye,cruel,worldpre  pTestFlowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZbzRx.png altTestFlowp  pTestCase.mflowp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt  ltmule xmlnsscriptinghttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulescripting xmlnsfilehttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulefile     xmlnsvmhttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulevm xmlnshttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecore     xmlnsdochttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamuledocumentation     xmlnsspringhttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans versionCE3.3.0     xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xsischemaLocation httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulefile httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulefilecurrentmulefile.xsd  httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulescripting httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulescriptingcurrentmulescripting.xsd  httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeansspringbeanscurrent.xsd  httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecore httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecorecurrentmule.xsd  httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulevm httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulevmcurrentmulevm.xsd gt      ltfileconnector nameinputFileConnector autoDeletetrue         streamingfalse validateConnectionstrue docnameFile fileAge60000          readFromDirectorysystemProperties[user.home]gt     ltcatchexceptionstrategy nameCatchExceptionStrategygt         ltlogger message Exception Handler  levelINFO docnameLoggergt     ltcatchexceptionstrategygt      ltflow nameTestCaseFlow1 docnameTestCaseFlow1gt         ltfileinboundendpoint pathsystemProperties[user.home]             responseTimeout10000 docnameInput File fileAge100 connectorrefinputFileConnectorgt             ltfilefilenameregexfilter patterninput.csv                 caseSensitivefalse gt         ltfileinboundendpointgt         ltbytearraytostringtransformer docnameByte Array to Stringgt         ltscriptingcomponent docnameGroovygt             ltscriptingscript engineGroovygt                 ltscriptingtextgtlt[CDATA[return payload.splitn]]gtltscriptingtextgt             ltscriptingscriptgt         ltscriptingcomponentgt         ltcollectionsplitter docnameCollection Splittergt         ltscriptingcomponent docnameGroovygt             ltscriptingscript engineGroovygt                 ltscriptingtextgtlt[CDATA[return payload.split,]]gtltscriptingtextgt             ltscriptingscriptgt         ltscriptingcomponentgt         ltcollectionsplitter docnameCollection Splittergt         ltscriptingcomponent docnameGroovygt             ltscriptingscript engineGroovygt                 ltscriptingtextgtlt[CDATA[if payload.equalsgoodbye                              throw new java.lang.RuntimeExceptionDang                                                  return payload]]gtltscriptingtextgt             ltscriptingscriptgt         ltscriptingcomponentgt         ltlogger messagegtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgt [payload] levelINFO docnameLogger gt     ltflowgt ltmulegt codepre

Actually, I havent yet found one exception to that rule or where have I been lately. jQuery plugin developers in particular, write code like sop  ul lipemExample 3em see a hrefhttpcoding.smashingmagazine.com20111011essentialjquerypluginpatterns relnofollowexample of an exampleap  pcodefunction   jQuerycodepli ul  pMy bible, a hrefhttpshop.oreilly.comproduct9780596805531.do relnofollowJavaScript The Definitive Guidea , doesnt use this practice at all  not once. Author David Flanagan sticks to codeexample 1code page 249 is the place where author comments this practice.p  pNever mind which construct, added parenthesis all have strongonestrong and only one intention To maximize readability. strongTo clarifystrong. Then, may I ask, clarify whatp  h2My reasoningh2  pWhen writing a closure in JavaScript, were defining a local variable in a function that is not supposed to be accessible from code outside. For the most part and due to context, our function is an anonymous one that isnt bound to an identifier. Like sop  ul lipemExample 4emp  pcodefunction   var local  Local variable codepli ul  pAgain due to context and what is usually the practice, we want to execute that snippet of code at once. So we throw in a couple of parenthesis. This will tell the JavaScript interpreter to run the functionp  ul lipemExample 5emp  pcodefunction   codepli ul  pTo clarify this in code, best practice is to add a couple of parenthesis, in a way this also clarifies the closurep  ul lipemExample 6emp  pcodefunction   codepli ul  pThis is an exact replica of codeexample 1code. My reasoning thus gives that codeexample 1codeis the way we should write code. Whenever I choose to use codeexample 2code, I only clarify the use of a closure, not the fact that our anonymous function is executed at once. But by the smallest of efforts to place our clarificationparenthesis on the outside of the entire code snippet, we can catch both.p  pemYes I can critique my reasoningem. In codeexample 3code, I find it appealing to think hey, outside reference is copied to an alias on the inside. The alternativep  ul lipemExample 7emp  pcodefunction   jQuerycodepli ul  p..isnt as clear in this particular regard. However, codeexample 2code doesnt use this passbyvalue technique. Personally, for the most part when I write closures, I dont have to pass anything in. And still, if we are allowed to be fundamentalist about it, the jQuery plugin practice never clarifies the immediate execution of our anonymous function. p  h2Example 1 usersh2  pIf my reasoning holds true, why is it then that the entire community out there use codeexample 1code Is their sole intention to only cast one of two clarifications Maybe just maybe, they dont even have a purpose but are following the lead of a mere tradition of which purpose we might not be able to explain I havent yet written a jQuery plugin, or used codeexample 2code because I began my career reading the bible. But if you are among the many who use codeexample 1code and have a reasoning for it, please share p

Negative 8661 pOur team is currently introducing automated testing to an existing Java EE web application that is deployed on Weblogic. Weve had success with unit testing using JUnit and Mockito which are automatically run when our app is built and deployed by Jenkins.p  pIntegration testing has been more challenging because our application relies on components provided by the Java EE container such as WorkManager. There are several Spring beans which require these components to initialize properly. One way weve been able to get around it is to create custom application context configuration files which create mocks of the components that we dont really need for testing but still require to initialize the bean. This has been somewhat of a maintenance nightmare because each integration test needs its own config and some can be quite involved.p  pWhat we really want is to be able to have the entire application initialized with the normal configuration used in a deployed environment when running our integration tests. Is there a way to have integration tests automatically execute after deployment through Jenkins or another tool p

But it doesnt work for any classes or IDs inside the group embedded through codeltusegtcode.p  pHow to fix itp  pOr maybe theres a better way to do itp  pI need to change only this particular part inside the embedded object when the user hovers it, not the whole group.

Some parts of this object need to be styled with custom colors from the CSS, because I need easy customization of those colors without changing the library objects code.p  pAnd then I need to signal the user when the mouse pointer is above such active object by styling its parts differently some bright outlines here and there to show the shape of the clickable areas when the mouse pointer is over them.p  pUnfortunately, I cannot apply the style to the codeltusegtcode elements subelements, because theyre not subelements of codeltusegtcode in the DOM as others already mentioned. I can apply some styles to the elements inside the codeltdefsgtcode section, because theyre in the DOM and theyre addressable with CSS selectors, but they emcannotem be hovered, because theyre invisible, so applying codehovercode pseudoclass to them doesnt work. And it doesnt work either if this class is applied to the codeltusegtcode, because then I cannot subselect the proper sub elements theyre not subelements of codeltusegtcode. So I dont have any hook to apply those codehovercode pseudoclass to.p  pMaybe theres some other solution to my problemp

Negative 8661 pWe have a web application in production which uses jQuery for transmitting data via AJAX as well as for some of the basic animation methods e.g. fadeIn, fadeOut, hide, show, slideUp, slideDown.p  pThe framework of the software calls in dynamically loaded PHP files as panels on the main interface. After some extended use of our software, form elements such as text fields, text areas and select boxes become unclickable but only in Internet Explorer 7 amp 8 Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer 910 all work correctly. The form elements are definitely not disabled as our validation system never requires disabling the elements. We are also not using any layered HTML elements with zindex so nothing is potentially hiding or transparent over top of the elements that would interfere with an onclick event. There are also no scripting errors and the problem is so intermittent has been almost impossible to track down using break points.p  pWe do not want to have to force our customers to use IE9.p  pAs best I can tell, this only occurs with form elements that have been transitioned in dynamically using jQuery with the animation effects.

Negative 8661 pI am having some trouble with the two events, they work fine, however I have ran into a problem I have a div inside of a div. When the inner div is in focus, I want a set of style buttons to be appended to the outer div. However when i try to click on the buttons, it unfocuses the inner div and makes the buttons go away. I want them to go away when focus is lost but I dont want focus to be lost when I press a button.

Negative 8661 pI have a database with 3 tables. codepersoncode, codeplayercode, and codecoachcode. The codepersoncode table contains things that the codeplayercode and codecoachcode have in common, such as codefirstNamecode, codelastNamecode, and codeemailcode.  The codeplayercode, and codecoachcode tables then have a link back to the codepersoncode table with a codepersonIdcode field.  Every person who accesses the site has a codepersoncode entry.  Additionally, some users may also have codeplayercode or codecoachcode entries.  The database is set up this way to maintain normalization.p  pIn my code, I have a codepersoncode, codeplayercode, and codecoachcode class.  The codeplayercode and codecoachcode inherit from codepersoncode.

Negative 8661 pI have two machines, that I would like both of them to communicate using sockets under C programming language.p  pI have developed two samples to represent both sides but I noticed that I can send data successfully if they are smaller than certain number.p  pThe size that I have tested but does not work is sending amp receiving 2048 bytes , on contrary, for other smaller sizes such as 258 Bytes, 1KByte it works fine.p  pAfter doing some investigations, I found out that, the sending operation has no errors while for the reception, I did not get any thing at all.p  pI have checked the sending and receiving buffer sizes on both machines and I guess they are sufficient.p  pHere are the first side of my codep  precode UDP client in the internet domain  include ltsystypes.hgt

Negative 8661 pJust five minutes ago i found how ArrayList works. It have elementData field which is array with specific type, if we add element and elementData array is full, collection internally create another array by this formulap  precodeoldCapacity  3  2  1 codepre  pAnd copy data from old array to new one. I just wondering, why is that, why not just double last size where can i get more theoretical information about internal representation of ArrayList collection with describing this formula. P.S. Sorry for my English, its not my native language.p

Negative 8661 pIn my program, Im coding a basic image editor. Part of this allows the user to draw a rectangular region and I pop up a display that shows that region zoomed by 3x or so which they can adjust further with the mouse wheel. If they right click and drag this image, it will move the zoom region around on the original image, basically acting as a magnifying glass.p  pThe problem is, Im seeing some serious performance issues even on relatively small bitmaps. If the bitmap showing the zoomed region is around 400x400 its still updating as fast as mouse can move and is perfectly smooth, but if I mouse wheel the zoom up to around 450x450, it immediately starts chunking, only down to around 2 updates per second, if that. I dont understand why such a small increase incurs such an enormous performance problem... its like Ive hit some internal memory limit or something. It doesnt seem to matter the size of the source bitmap that is being zoomed, just the size of the zoomed bitmap.p  pThe problem is that Im using Graphics.DrawImage and a PictureBox. Reading around this site, I see that the performance for both of these is typically not very good, but I dont know enough about the inner workings of GDI to improve my speed. I was hoping some of you might know where my bottlenecks are, as Im likely just using these tools in poor ways or dont know of a better tool to use in its place.p  pHere are some snippets of my mouse events and related functions.p  precodeprivate void pictureBoxMouseDownobject sender, MouseEventArgs e               else if e.Button  System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Right                       slide the zoomed part to look at a different area of the original image             if zoomFactor gt 1                              isMovingZoom  true                  try saving the graphics object are these settings helping at all                 zoomingGraphics  Graphics.FromImagedisplayImage                 zoomingGraphics.CompositingQuality  System.Drawing.Drawing2D.CompositingQuality.HighSpeed                 zoomingGraphics.InterpolationMode  System.Drawing.Drawing2D.InterpolationMode.Low                 zoomingGraphics.SmoothingMode  System.Drawing.Drawing2D.SmoothingMode.HighSpeed                 zoomingGraphics.PixelOffsetMode  PixelOffsetMode.HighSpeed                              private void pictureBoxMouseMoveobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              if isMovingZoom                       some computation on where they moved mouse ommitted here              zoomRegion.X  originalZoomRegion.X  delta.X             zoomRegion.Y  originalZoomRegion.Y  delta.Y             zoomRegionEnlarged  scaleToOriginalzoomRegion               overwrite the existing displayImage to prevent more Bitmaps being allocated             createZoomedImageimage.Bitmap, zoomRegionEnlarged, zoomFactor, displayImage, zoomingGraphics                private void createZoomedImageBitmap source, Rectangle srcRegion, float zoom, Bitmap output, Graphics outputGraphics              Rectangle destRect  new Rectangle0, 0, intsrcRegion.Width  zoom, intsrcRegion.Height  zoom              outputGraphics.DrawImagesource, destRect, srcRegion, GraphicsUnit.Pixel          if displayImage  originalDisplayImage ampamp displayImage  output             displayImage.Dispose         setImageInBoxoutput        sets the picture box image, as well as resizes the window to fit     void setImageInBoxBitmap bmp              pictureBox.Image  bmp         displayImage  bmp         this.Width  pictureBox.Width  okButton.Width  SystemInformation.FrameBorderSize.Width  2  25         this.Height  Math.Max450, pictureBox.Height  SystemInformation.CaptionHeight  SystemInformation.FrameBorderSize.Height  2  20       private void pictureBoxMouseUpobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              else if e.Button  System.Windows.Forms.MouseButtons.Right                      if isMovingZoom                              isMovingZoom  false                 zoomingGraphics.Dispose                            codepre  pAs you can see, Im not declaring a new Bitmap every time I want to draw something, Im reusing an old Bitmap and the Bitmaps graphics object, though I dont know if there is much cost with calling Graphics.FromImage repeatedly.

Negative 8661 pIs is possible to somehow create a key or seed that you can initialize a random number generator with, and thereby ensuring that all the random numbers using this key will be identical. p  pOr is there another technique that i can use with similar results p  pwhat i like to be able to do is create a random seed. then use this seed to initialize a random number generator, use this random number generator to build a tilemap or something else that requires alot of random numbers. p  pThen send the same seed to another client which will be able to generator the excact same map because the random numbers are the samep  pIm just curious if something like this is possible, dont really care about platform etc.p

So, Ive got a very generic router that passes to a catchall controller.p  pThis catchall controller PagesController uses the url as key to retrieve Page Type from a database.

Negative 8661 pI am using Blend 2012 to design an HTML5 Windows 8 metro app, but I am running into problems because Blend runs all JavaScript in the webpage in the background, live updating my app while it is running. This slows down blend horribly, as I am still prototyping and havent finished the functionality of the app yet, so it is doing a lot of debug printing, etc. p  pIs there a way to either disable JavaScript or simply pause execution so I can edit the HTML in Blend without it running my code I would prefer a solution that is toggled in Blend, rather than adding code in my project to disable functionality if it detects Blend as its host, however I will gladly accept that if it is the sanest method.p  pThank youp

Here is a brief summaryp  ul liUtils An Android library project with several utility classes copied from my existing Java code base and Androidified.li liUtilsTest Corresponding unit tests for classes in the Utils project. Has a reference to easymock.jar. These tests run perfectly fine on the device.li liAppOne A simple Android app with no dependencies to Utils, EasyMock, or anything else.li liAppOneTest Unit tests for AppOne classes. These tests run OK as well.li liAppTwo An Android app with a dependency to the Utils library project. li liAppTwoTest Unit tests for AppTwo classes. Has depedencies to Utils and EasyMock. All of these tests fail as described above cant find class under test.li ul  pAll of the test classes are using JUnit3 semantics extend TestCase, no annotations, etc. None of the classes under test are Activitybased yet. I am just testing support classes for now, and these have only minor references to Android SDK classes e.g. android.util.Log, android.graphics.Color.p  pI thought that having external dependencies might be causing problems somehow, so I tried adding some unnecessary calls to Utils classes in AppOne and AppOneTest, but these tests still worked. I also tried deleting all the tests from AppTwoTest except for one that doesnt refer to Utils or EasyMock the SeverityTest class from the LogCat output, and this still failed.p  pI tried clean builds, restarting Eclipse, deleting and recreating the AppTwoTest project, and nothing seems to work. Any ideas on what could be causing this problemp

Negative 8661 pBy default Visual Studio doesnt keep references on TreeNodes at class level when they are created in designer mode in TreeViews.p  pI found that for some nodes that I frequently access, it would be much easier to have reference to them, than to access them by their Name property, as it is easier to type.p  pHowever, I wonder if this approach has some downsides In my case, those TreeNodes are kept alive as long as application is running anyway, so my guess is that keeping such reference could not harm, but just checking, it is interesting that I couldnt find any similar question or text...p

Negative 8661 pI have a table that is Full Text indexed, on which I query using codeFREETEXTcode. The table is filled from other tables that have constant data, rarely changed. Now there are few millions of rows.p  pTable structurep  precodeID identity, PK Text varchar, FT IX ForeignID int  of the original ID in its original table codepre  pIm not satisfied with the results, because sometimes a word is repeated too many times and therefore the row gets high ranked by the engine.

Negative 8661 pA client wants all Activity records assigned to records in a custom entity reassigned to the matching records in a different entity.p  pBasically, they have an old custom entity with Activities of various types assigned to those records. They decided to do away with the custom entity and instead go with the Opportunity entity because of its hooks into Lead. So the data from the custom entity was exported and reimported back into Opportunity. But now I need to take all the Activity records and do the same, remapping them from the old custom entity records to the matching Opportunity record.p  pBut there doesnt appear to be any intuitive method of doing this.

Negative 8661 pThis seems like a pretty common use case, but I cant for the life of me find any information on how to set this up.p  pIve got an Admin site where I upload images and then my normal website separate project where I need to display those images. Both projects need to be able to display the images so I cant just simply store them in the websites project directory and call it a day.p  pIn production, this is a nobrainer. I just set up a virtual directory in IIS, but developing in Visual Studio, theres no direct support for this. Ive seen things online that tell you do go into the IIS Express config files and add the virtual directory manually, but theres two huge problems with this 1 Im in a multideveloper environment and making every developer do this in a consistent way manually is a nogo and 2 theres no automated way to reference this static directory in my code, so thats going to entail a lot of hardcoding paths to image references, which is a hugely bad idea.p  pIm aware, also, that I can create links in my project, but Im dealing with uploads, not static resources that I know about at design time, so creating links for every new upload manually in my project especially when this is only for testing in development is insane.p  pSo what is the best way to dynamically share resources between projects just for the purposes of development in Visual Studiop  pFor what its worth, these are both ASP.NET MVC 4 projects and Im using Visual Studio 2012 on a Windows 7 box.p  pstrongEDITstrong I should specify that upon uploading the image, a relative path to that image is stored in a database table. I suppose my real issue is in resolving that partial path into a real accessible URL from an entirely different project. If I was in the same project, I would simply to something like codeUrl.ContentModel.ImageUrlcode, but this obviously wont resolve if the image is not actually in the same project.p

Negative 8661 pIm doing a projcet of dating books, and my main idea is to do it with ngram. I entered here a hrefhttpbooks.google.comngrams relnofollowhttpbooks.google.comngramsa and I found the ngrams that have the most unequivocal graphs unconstant value over the years. Then I wrote a code in python that reads books  it take the book, some ngrams, and then calculates the frequanty of the ngrams over the text. For example, the ngram ex in the text extarminate all human beings with explosive grandes would be  0.05263157894736842 because theres 2 exs in this text and theres 38 possible 2letters combinations, so I thought the ngram would be 238.p  pSo I did this calculation on a lot of books with 1gram the ABC and I got more or less the same numbers with all the books. And then I went back to Googles ngram, and apparently the numbers I got and the number they got were completly different. For example, the 1gram a was around 0.078, b was 0.0135 and so one, but Googles ngram was [a1.54] and [b0.0066]... p  pI reached the conclusion that Ive got this calculation all wrong. Now, Im asking you what is the strongREALstrong calculation of ngrams. I really need to understand this so please, if you know how this thing works, please let me know.p  pThanks alot p  pEdit after answered I really got higher values than Google, because my valuse are probability 0 to 1, so if I want to convert this values to s I have to multiply by 100, and it make sense because there is more a 8 as a letter in the english language than a as a word.p

Negative 8661 pIm trying to achieve a relatively easy goal create a simple crossplatform CRM app to manage contactscustomers and their relations with companies. At the current state Im fairly confused on how to approach this after some early motivational success.p  pAfter half a year of ObjectiveC and iOS development under my belt I wanted to get more serious and start on a real app project, which would be the mentioned CRM app. Then I heard about PhoneGap, tried it out and was very impressed. From there on it was clear to me that my app should be crossplatform.p  pTo have a better understanding of what Im trying to achieve, here are some details about the requirementsp  ul liSimple data model, 5 or 6 entities total. OnetoMany and ManytoMany relationships.li liHave a tabbar widget to quickly toggle between companies, clients, etc.li lisearchasyoutype on listviewsli limasterdetail view behavior for listviewsli liback buttons on the header, addedit buttons as well. Classical app layout as you would expect.li ul  pMy first steps lead me to JQuery Mobile for the UI which, at first glance, looked like the perfect candidate to quickly build a UI that fits the requirements and takes off a lot of coding from my hands. The mockup I created worked great on all devices, but then I hit a roadblock the masterdetail view navigationrouting. I had no clue how its supposed to work and the JQuery Mobile docs dont supply an answer or bestpractice for that. I figured out that I might be able to just pass an id in a querystring and read it on the details view. That worked to some extent, but only when the page is in an external file detailsview.htmlid3 and not just an internal one detailsviewid3. And even then I experienced some odd behavior when reading the value from the querystring on the pageshow event. Anyway, all this tinkering with logic and design led me to the clue that there must be a better and more organized approach, something like MVC. And apparently there is, namely backbone.js and Angular.js and ember.js etc. that come with decent deeplinking. Some googling told me that Angular.js might be a better fit for me since it comes with 2way databinding and makes me write less code, which is always appreciated.p  pBut then theres the problem of a functional overlap between JQuery Mobile and Angular.js since JQuery Mobile has its own routing capabilities. I could disable that part I guess, but I would probably lose the page transitions in the process no more pages in the index.html I found topcoat as an alternative for the UI but it currently lacks a much neededwanted tabbar widget as it seems. Just as Twitter Bootstrap which seems to lack it as well.p  pAnd I havent even touched persistent storage yet The PhoneGap API provides storage capabilities but after some years with nice ORM implementations like Hibernate, Entity Framework and Core Data I want something more natural than pure SQL. On the other hand, pure SQL might be doable since the scope of the project is somewhat limited. So I came across JayData but havet tried it yet. Since Angular.js seems to prefer data input in JSON format, maybe Lawnchair.js might be a good idea I looked into it but I couldnt quickly find out how to reference relations andor objects in a traditional way. My learning curve aside, is lawnchair.js a good way at all to store relational data Or CouchDB from a server perspective Most of the examples I found only stored nonrelated data or contained arrays not referencing other objects. I guess all it needs is storing the object identifiers in those arrays, but how to do autocreate, autoincrement them and make sure that theyre uniquep  pI would greatly appreciate your thoughts, comments and a little guidance on this p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 8661 pHello on my page I was positoning addtocart button. It is ok on pages likes that the pages that have thumbnails under main image a hrefhttptest.gradientstudio.euyfsmagentomuzisaturatekatahamathgamblackred.html relnofollowhttptest.gradientstudio.euyfsmagentomuzisaturatekatahamathgamblackred.htmla  but it is more top on pages like that  a hrefhttptest.gradientstudio.euyfsmagentov41934adidasslvrshopbag.html relnofollowhttptest.gradientstudio.euyfsmagentov41934adidasslvrshopbag.htmla which has no thumbnails under main image. I guess it is because img  box is above addtocart button so it affect the relative position of the button, but I dodnt know how to change it. I looked some layout xml files and try to change it but no success. Any ideas  Thanksp

Negative 8661 pIn our product we use codeProduct Idcode in Wix to tell it to generate a new product code for every new build. We now have a requirement during install time to record the product code of the MSI being installed into one of our registry keys. We could infer the product code at runtime by looping through entries in the Uninstall registry keys looking for our product name and version, but it would be cleaner to directly record this information at install time.p  pIs there a way for Wix to tell me what codeProductCodecode it has generated so that I can add it as a variable to a codeRegistryValuecode Wix elementp  pIm guessing there isnt, so I tried using a codeltdefinegtcode to set a variable to all question marks codecode and used this variable in the codeProductcode element as well as the codeRegistryValuecode element. This works for the codeProductcode element ok, it continues to generate a new GUID, but in the codeRegistryValuecode element this variable is not expanded at compile time, meaning the registry key simply gets added with all question marks.p  pIs there any pure Wix way to achieve what I want I could generate the codeProductCodecode outside of Wix and have the Wix elements use this as an environment variable, but this adds an extra level of complexity to the build process  something else that could break. I would like it if I could do this purely with Wix.p

In my answer youll find the code for the plugin as well as a google drive download link.

During the request the save button will display an animated ajax loader.p

Negative 8661 pIm drawing a pie chart using a CAShapeLayer for each slice of the pie. Even when the end angle of one pie slice is equal to the start angle of the adjacent slice, antialiasing is resulting in the underlying background color appearing between each pice slice if the border between slices is at an angle.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comQdu8d.pngimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQdu8d.png althttpi.stack.imgur.comQdu8d.pngap  pId like to eliminate the slight gap between slices while still using antialiasing so the resulting pie cart still looks smooth. Conceptually, it seems if there were a way to apply antialiasing to the entire CALayer and its pie slice sublayers after all the pie slices were drawn, that would do the trick... The pie slices would be antialiased into each other instead of into the background.p  pIve played around with as many CALayer properties as I can think of and am having a hard time finding more information on this. Any ideasp  pstrongUPDATEstrong See my answer below.p

Negative 8661 pIve got a typical media block selling points row, with images on top and text below. Currently Im using flexbox to keep everything orderly, but Ill create a fallback probably tablecells or inlineblock eventually. Thats not the issue in fact, flexbox is AMAZING.p  pAn example a hrefhttpdrwoe.nl relnofollowhttpdrwoe.nlap  pMy problem is this two of the images are the same width and height. Imagine circles with an illustrated character inside them. The third image has a circle of the same height and width, but the illustrated character breaks out of the circle, making the image larger. p  pI have given the first two images the responsive treatment, and they resize together nicely. To get the third one to render as the designer wanted, I have to specify a minwidth at least to allow it to match the circles sizes. Does this make sense p  pIf I didnt have to make these images resize nicely, this wouldnt be an issue. But I cant figure out how to keep the third image, which is technically larger than the two due to the breakout illustration resize with them.p  pI do have the PSD of the design and can pull out pieces that I need. I have tried creating CSS3 circles and adding the illustration in a pseudo element positioning absolutely, but I couldnt get them to resize together.p  pIs this a genuine brain teaser or am I missing something simple Thanks very muchp

In some instances, that cell contain a path name to another python file for example, the table cell may have the following path name in it CUsersmeDocumentsWorkingPyFilesExample.py.  My python program assigns each cell value to the variable CommentsExpression and then checks the variable to see if in fact it does reference a path name to an exisiting file using os.path.exists.

Negative 8661 pI cant quite recall what library GCC works with to implement stack unwinding, which is used for c exceptions and call traces, and I know theres no means defined in the C specification, so any answers to this are platform specific.

Negative 8661 pWhen I create a new class inside a package for some reason it creates two class files one inside of the package and one out of it. I wanted to know why this is happening Also, at times, Eclipse are kind of hiding some of my classes, so that they do not appear in the project explorer, although when you create a new class file with the same name of the class that disappeared, it says the class already exists...p  pWhen I refresh KBDF5KBD the package, these problems are sort of solved. But they happen again when I create a new class or when I restart Eclipse. So I wanted a different solution from keep pressing KBDF5KBD everytime...p

I run 2 threads for that At the end the tuple with Keywords column as Authentication, Failure should have Counter value as 2 And the tuple with Keywords column value Authentication, Passes should have Counter value as 1.

Negative 8661 pI have been searching the forums and Stack Overflow all day today trying to figure out the proper way to eliminate the annoying flicker when dragging images picture boxes around a panel on my form.  I am trying to replicate a card game for my friends and I to be able to play from home.  I have derived from the Picturebox class so that I can add some additional properties to my object.  Here is the code for that classp  precode    class Card  PictureBox       public string CardId  get set      public string CardName  get set      public string CardColor  get set      public string CardType  get set      public string CardRarity  get set      public bool Tapped  get set      public bool Revealed  get set           codepre  pI have a panel setup so that when a player double clicks a card in their hand it adds it to the panel.  Then I have setup a drag and drop so they can move the cards around the panel.  Here is the code for that.p  precode    int posX     int posY      private void DragCardobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              if e.Button  MouseButtons.Left                      dragging  true             posX  e.X             posY  e.Y                   private void isDraggingobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              if dragging  true                                     Cardsender.Left  e.X  posX             Cardsender.Top  e.Y  posY                            Cardsender.BringToFront                                   private void DoneDragobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              dragging  false              codepre  pThe problem is that I have a background image in the panel so when the card moves it shows a trail behind it from where its original location was prior to the move.  I have searched and searched and seen so many different methods of getting rid of this but nothing has seemed to work for me.  I would greatly appreciate it if someone could explain it in lamest terms as I am very new to coding.  Thank you very much for your help.

Negative 8661 pI feel like this is sort of a silly question, but at my work I am often dealing with directories in projects that are deeply nested e.g.  10 directories deep in the projects directory tree. When Im working in Command Prompt, the path are often tediously long and take up a lot of space. Is there any way to shorten these paths in the Command Prompt window Obviously its nothing dire, Im just not sure how to do it. Thanksp

But this is of course causing some issues here. p  pstrongRequirementstrongp  pI simply require the ability to keep the Dates tab the same, regardless of which timezone Im in. p  pstrongKey Pointsstrongp  pThere are a few reasons why the format is saved as it is in the Years, etc and that cant be changed because it impacts the entire app. The UIDatePicker is set to a UK Locale in the Storyboard and there are a few reasons for that. However, even with the locale set to Default, the same issue occurs. Timezones in America and Canada remove a year, so 2014 becomes 2013, 2013 becomes 2012, 2012 becomes 2011 in the Dates tab. Thats what doesnt make sense to me. p  pAny guidance on this would be really appreciatedp

As we know, 15Puzzle has 16 tiles Were counting the blank tile as the tile with the number 0. So, how many possible states has the 15puzzle problem Well, its factorial16 states. So, thats a lot of states. That means that we want our states to be as small as possible... If our initial state is too far away from the solution, we may explore so much states that our program memory will just explode.p  pSo... my 15puzzle representation consist of using bits and logical operatorsp  precode Struct for the 15puzzle States Representation  typedef struct state      unsigned int quad1  This int represent the first 8 numbers      unsigned int quad2  This int represent the last 8 numbers      unsigned short zero  This is the position of the zero   state codepre  pSo what Im doing is using logical operators to move and change the numbers, using the minimum space.p  pstrongNotestrong that the size of this struct is strong12 bytesstrong Because it has three integersp  pstrong Manhattan Distancestrongp  pThis is just the well known Manhattan Distance Heuristic.

Its not considering reusing states or nodes.  It just keeps allocating over and over nodes and states, even though theyve been calculated before. p  pIve been thinking a lot about this... Each time you run the solver, it can expand millions of nodes real quick. And as we know, A may reexplore nodes when you find another path with a cost less than the previous one. That means... If we explore 1 million nodes, it will be 24 millions of bytes Wow... And considering that each node has a state, that would be 14 bytes per node, those are 14 millions of bytes...p  pstrongemIn the end, What I need is a way of reusingfreeing space so my computer wont crash when I execute this solver.emstrongp  pPD Sorry for the long postp

The applications or services that hold your registry file may not function properly afterwards.  p  pDETAIL    1 user registry handles leaked from RegistryUsermySID Process 5568  has opened key REGISTRYUSERmySIDp  pI dont know how the Event Log errors are related to the exception, if at all.p  pThe PsExec command line is PsExec accepteula myServerName d pathtoexep  pIm wondering if its a problem with the user profile service, so I was thinking about not loading the profile when calling PsExec, but since its so intermittent, Im not sure how I would know if Ive fixed it. Searching the internet shows that some people think it might be related to impersonation, but nothing that directly matches my situation.p  pHas anyone seen anything like this  This is really weird.p  pThanks Philp

Negative 8661 pIm evaluating the substitution of some http pooling features of my production application with the new JEE7 supported Websocket feature. Im planning to use Wildfly 8 as my next production server environment and Ive migrated some of my websockets compatible modules with good results on development time but I have the doubt about how it will work on production and what performance will have the websockets implementation on a a high load enviroment. p  pIve been searching documentation about the most used JEE servers but the main manufacturers havent yet a production JEE7 enviroment and when they have a JEE7 version, they havent enought documentation about how the implementation works or some values of maximum concurrency users. In addition, some not official comments says websocket connections are associated with a server socket but this seems to be not very efficient.p  pWe might assume the Websocket is used only for receive data from the client point of view and we assume each user will receive, for example, an average of 10 messages per minute with a little json serialized object a typical model data class. My requirement is more like a stock market than a chat application, for example.p  pWhats the real performance can I expect for a Websockets use on production enviroment in Wildfly 8 Server, for example Also Im interested about some comparision with another JEE7 implementations you are acquainted with.p

Negative 8661 pIts becoming a nightmare for me solving this problem. I am developing an app using phonegap. I have used highcharts in it for Graphs. The graph is coming properly but not the tooltip in the graph. Please check the code below, I need this code to be able to show the tooltip with proper data. There has to be a loop of the following code and it has to be for every user or series in the graph. So I have ran a for loop in PHP and saved it in a variable and got the whole output of the loop using AJAX in a JSON format. p  pWhen I use the variable in the Javascript code in which I have saved the AJAX output, it just doesnt do anything but if I alert than it alerts the exact code which I want to make tooltip work. I have tried eval also but no benefit.

Negative 8661 pI have the following scenariop  ol lipThread A will send a number of tasks to both Thread B and C. the exact number of tasks is unknownpli lipFor each of the tasks, thread A will send it to B and C at the same time asynchronously, and then if either of the B or C finished the task successfully or both failed, A would continue to send the next task. The idea here is to avoid blocking as much as possible. i.e., for the same task, when B finished it while C is still processing, A can send next task immediately and dont need wait for C to get the result.pli lipits expected that the slower one in B and C can skip some tasks as long as the task is done by the other. For example, B may finish task t1 t2 t3 t4, and C only finish t1 t4 due to that when C received t2 and t3, its still processing t1 for some reason.pli ol  pis there any thread synchronization construct suitable for this I am checking codejava.util.concurrent.Phasercode, but seems it doesnt fit my need.

Negative 8661 pIm using Jython and trying to get the user to input a password.  However, I would like it to show an asterisk rather than the characters that the user is inputting.  I managed to do something similar using getpass, but it required you to type into the cmd line, and it would just not show anything rather than an asterisk.p  pIm looking to have the user type into a dialog box the input command brings up a box that would be perfect.  For example, thisp  precodeimport sys  password  inputPlease enter your password  if password  None     if the user hits cancel     sys.exit0 codepre  pHowever, it does not mask the text.

Negative 8661 pIn a game, the server might have to send the client a packet with info to, lets say, add an Enemy. The data to add such an enemy might be similar to every enemy position, id... but there is a need to distinguish which enemy it is. Is it the zombie A werewolf Well.p  pI can remember two ways of doing thisp  p1  Create an Enum.br So I could have an Enum with every type of enemy there is, and in my Packet, I would send that type. strongProsstrong Only one Packet to add several types of enemies, only one method to handle the receiving of it.p  pstrongConsstrong Everytime I want to add a new enemy, i must create a new entry on the enum,  and the method which receives will most likely be an annoying big switchcase.p  p2  Create a packet per enemy, each with a different handle methodbr strongProsstrong It seems more organized since each element has an assigned packet and method, and no need to add an entry to the enum although id need to add a new handle method so.... yeah.p  pstrongConsstrong Many enemies mean many packets, which mean many handle methods, which might be a mess.p  pSo, basicly, tldr, either i have a PacketAddEnemy with an enum like EnemyType and a few switchcases, or I have PacketAddZombie, PacketAddWerewolf, etc, but end up with a spam of packets and methods.p  pI prefer the first option, but I dislike both.

Negative 8661 pI am concerned with the following question How likely is changing vectors in C, that were allocated in R, to cause problemsp  pI know that rdevelopers recommend readonly access to Robjects and if one wants to modify, we have to copy stuff.

I dont want to deal with external pointers, which do not seem to offer a convenient solution for what I am trying to accomplish. So I take this approach I preallocate the vector I need before calling the Cfunction. I pass this  vector as argument to the function, I grep the pointer to the array and modify elements of that array directly in C. So I dont return anything.p  pSo here is my example C function using inline and RcppEigenp  precodecode lt     int n  INTEGERnR int p  INTEGERpR  double  xin  REALXR double  yin  REALyR double  solin  REALsolR  EigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt Xxin,n,p EigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt yyin,p,n EigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt solsolin,n,n  sol.noalias  Xy    settings lt getPluginRcppEigen settingsenvPKGCXXFLAGS lt pastefopenmp O2 , settingsenvPKGCXXFLAGS settingsenvPKGLIBS lt pastefopenmp lgomp, settingsenvPKGLIBS  fun lt cxxfunctionsignatureXRnumeric, yRnumeric, solRnumeric,nRintger,pRinteger, code, pluginRcppEigen,settingssettings codepre  pNow in R I would do thisp  precoden  as.integer100 p  as.integer3000  Xltmatrixrnormnp,n,p   preallocating the solution vector sol  doublenn   calling the c functions while passing the solution vector   funX,tX,sol,n,p   check if we get same results  dimsol lt cn,n all.equaltcrossprodX,sol codepre  pThat way I avoided an unnecessary copy of the solution vector.

Negative 8661 pI have made a website for a university unit with mysqli and php  beginner www.mandyevansartist.com where i have a database of different images. When you click on gallery in the menu bar it uses a select statement to display the catagory head . When you click a picture it uses a select statement to display the images in that catagory.

Negative 8661 pI am working on one app. Which capture images continuously, there is one button to stop capturing. But the problem is that button targeted method is not being called. Even when I clicked on the screen anywhere it didnt detect touch or gesture. I have implemented gesture and touch delegate methods to check. Capturing image is not on main thread so main thread is free. So I am not able to find the reason why view not able to detect the touch. There are almost 67 button on that particular view, none of them trigger their method. While working with ios7 its running properly, It will detect touch and button targeted method trigger also. p  pI have thought that there should be anyview that will be overlap those button so i print the stake of subview , which is as below.Button which stop capturing is with text START. I have just share stake after START button only as i think in stake the last item will be on top in view. p  precodeltUIButtonLabel 0x15dfb0d0 frame  5 14 41 16 text  START  opaque  NO userInteractionEnabled  NO layer  ltUILabelLayer  0x15dfb190gtgt   ltUIButton 0x15e8c590 frame  63 7 36 32 opaque  NO autoresize   RMBM layer  ltCALayer 0x15e8c690gtgt   ltUIButtonLabel 0x15df0400 frame  15 10 6 12 text  0 opaque   NO userInteractionEnabled  NO layer  ltUILabelLayer 0x15d98db0gtgt   ltUIImageView 0x15e97c00 frame  295 272 1557 1568  clipsToBounds  YES hidden  YES autoresize  WH  autoresizesSubviews  NO layer  ltCALayer 0x15ea2920gtgt   ltUILayoutGuide 0x15e90ba0 frame  0 0 0 0 hidden  YES layer   ltCALayer 0x15ea2b10gtgt   ltUILayoutGuide 0x15e86120 frame  0 1024 0 0 hidden  YES  layer  ltCALayer 0x15e6fc40gtgt   ltMPVolumeView 0x15db7840 frame  18 340 284 23 alpha  0 opaque   NO layer  ltCALayer 0x15dbd2e0gtgt   ltUILabel 0x15daee40 frame  0 0 0 0 text  No Volume  Available opaque  NO autoresize  WBM userInteractionEnabled   NO layer  ltUILabelLayer 0x15dd5be0gtgt   ltMPButton 0x15dd5e00 baseClass  UIButton frame  131.5 2.5 21.5  18 alpha  0 opaque  NO autoresize  LMBM layer  ltCALayer  0x15dd6030gtgt   ltUIImageView 0x15de0c30 frame  39.25 41 100 100 alpha  0  opaque  NO userInteractionEnabled  NO tag  1886548836 layer   ltCALayer 0x15ea5330gtgt   ltUIImageView 0x15ea5790 frame  0 0 21.5 18 clipsToBounds  YES  opaque  NO userInteractionEnabled  NO layer  ltCALayer  0x15ea5810gtgt codepre  pI am using autolayout.

Negative 8661 pIt will probably help if I precede the information with this emIt is a stock shareholder database. New rowslines would equal new shareholders in a company. Each shareholder in the old system has what is called a shareholder number and is exactly six characters long with preceding zeros.emp  pAnd my direct question is emHow do I give all the new inserted rows unique IDs that will also be alphabetized based on one of the rows. I need to insert new names and have their IDs be in the same order as the names are alphabetically.emp  pstrongDetailsstrong p  pIm importing a database from decades ago into a new PHP program. When a row was added in the old system, it took a persons name, linked it with a number, and put it in. The problematic thing is that the entire alphabetic system is sorted by ID instead of directly from the names.p  pBasically, somebody with the last name Afrebos would have an ID like 032500 And somebody with the last name Williams would have an ID like 895573 And somebody with the last name Zeta would be 985000. The DB doesnt seem to know the alphabet and is completely reliant on the order of the ID numbers. p  pThe new system Im making will sort by name and would not need these numbers anymore. However, my boss wants to continue using these old numbersthey correlate to other companies systems. I could just choose random unique numbers from now on when rows are added, but for cleanliness and professionalism sake I would like to continue having everything organized in the way it has been for years. p  pAny ideas on how I can do this with PHPSQLPDO Any help at all would be very appreciated.p

Negative 8661 pRight now I have a few services running on localhost with Apache and some python bindnings on different ports.p  pSince my area of expertise is in .net an webapi I am considering to add a webapi project infront of thse and do authorization in webapi instead of having to add stuff to apache. Aswell as map different routes to same localhost endpoint.p  pMy question is then, is this a common practise to do such, is there any obvious downfalls that I should consider before doings this. Webapi being configured on IIS, should I expect latency for IIS calling localhost  as are there anything that makes localhost slower to respond than normal endpoints.p  pReason for not using apache is that since I am on windows and experienced with IIS.Net, the cost of fixng something that goes wrong or adding new stuff to apache is higher than sticking to what i know.p

Negative 8661 pIve been reading about the use of Redis sentinel for failover. I plan to have 1 master  1 slave, and turn the slave into a master if the master goes down for more than 1 minute. I know this is 100 possible with Sentinel.p  pHowever, Ive seen documentation mention the use of multiple Sentinels. Lets assume this is not possible ie. budget or technical constraints. I assume I can have this configurationp  ul li1 Sentinel in Server Ali liMaster in Server Bli liSlave in Server Cli ul  pWhats the benefit of having multiple sentinels as opposed to 1 My app can only connect to 1 sentinel at a time, and even if there were 2 sentinels, my app cant rotate or switch between either of them if one goes down wo some complicated logic in my app layer.p

This is  my idea.p  pBut today, I found a new problem when I sleep background thread a long time,then back json data to front,front can response and done some js function,but when I perform a very timeconsuming operation in urlone background,when it  return to front,the front is no response. there must be some problem I  have not realized, sop

What Im missing is how to access and save that response to an object.p  pIve looked over the Locomotive and Express docs and couldnt pull it together. Any help is appreciatedp  pThanksp

The chairs in each row have numbers from 1 to 100. Write a program that will calculate the length of the shortest path from the front to the back of the hall. Each chair is 1 unit wide and each row is 1 unit deep from the front of a chair to the front of the chair behind it. It is not possible to move diagonally. You may start in front of any gap in the front row and end behind any gap in the last row. You always walk through the middle of a gap. Illustrated is the shortest path through a hall, with five rows of chairs. In the illustration the hall is only 10 chairs wide instead of 100. The first number in the input will contain the number n  the number of rows. The next n lines will have two numbers, separated by a space, indicating where the gaps are. Example Input 5 3 6 2 8 4 5 7 8 3 10 p  pI think I have an efficient algorithm that I think will work, but Im not sure how to implement it into Java.p  pWhat I want to do is break up each choice into a search tree so for instance if the user input wasp  pnumber of rows 3p  pSpaces  4 7           2 9          8 11p  pMake 2 search treesp  precode              4                               7                    2           9                     2           9      8   11      8   11             8      11     8      11 codepre  pAnd then find  the path where the difference between each node is the smallest  So in this case the shortest path would be in the second tree 798 with the total distance being 5 798 So my question is then p  ol lipIs this acceptable algorithm given the problempli lipHow would I implement either this algorithm or another in java pli ol  pJuanLopes Take for instance this example 0s represent a space.p  pRow6 0 2 3 4 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow5 0 2 3 4 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow4 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow3 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow2 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pRow1 1 2 3 0 5 6 0 8 9p  pWhat I understand from your algorithm is that it looks at each row individually. So through rows 14 the distance between each space to the next row is equal but when you get to row 5 if you went down the path where all the 4s were missing it would take you longer compared to going down the path with all the 7s missing, does your solution take that into account  p

Negative 8661 pUsing Storyboards and Autolayout, I have a UIViewController with a UIScrollView as the main view. I have several container views embedded in the scroll view. Some of those embedded container views contain UITableViews, each having cells of different heights. Ill need the tableViews height to be large enough to show all cells at once, as scrolling will be disabled on the tableView.p  pIn the main UIViewController, container views height has to be defined in order for the scroll view to work properly. This is problematic because theres no way for me to know how large my tableView will be once all its cells of varying heights are finished rendering. strongHow can I adjust my container views height at runtime to fit my nonscrolling UITableViewstrongp  pSo far, Ive done the followingp  precode in embedded UITableViewController    voidviewDidLoad     force layout early so I can determine my tables height   [self.tableView layoutIfNeeded]    if self.detailsDelegate          [self.detailsTableDelegate didDetermineHeightForDetailsTableViewself.tableView]       in my main UIViewController  I have an IBOutlet to a height constraint set up on my container view  this initial height constraint is just temporary, and will be overridden  once this delegate method is called  voiddidDetermineHeightForDetailsTableViewUITableView tableView    self.detailsContainerHeightConstraint.constant  tableView.contentSize.height  codepre  pThis is working fine and I was pleased with the results. However, I have one or two more container views to add, which will have nonscrolling tableViews, and Id hate to have to create a new delegate protocol for each container view. I dont think I can make the protocol I have generic.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 8661 pIn our application Im moving from a TStringGrid to TVirtualStringTree component. A lot of data is being displayed max. 50000 lines and 5 columns. One column contains on or more lines of text. I managed to implement multiline functionality using DrawCell in the stringgrid with optimal performance instant redraw of all lines on resize and scrolling without hitches I have a list of row heights in memory, which will be updated when redraw is needed.p  pTransferring this multiline functionality to the VirtualStringTree is not as performant as the stringgrid alternative. I tried numerous implementations but have not yet succeeded. This is easily reproducable in the Demo application of the VirtualStringTree installation package p  ol liIn the MultilineDemo form, set the rootNodeCount of the VirtualStringTree to 10.000.li liWhen running the demo, select Automatically adjust node height to node text.li ol  pInitial redrawrepaint will take a while using lots of CPU. Ater each resize, jumping to topbottom causes the same phenomenon, or even causing a stack overflow exception but thats another issue ....

Which is logical and I understand perfectly well why. Yet, I would like to know if its possible to avoid that, like kinda resetting the sensors or something like that, and how I can do it.p  pIm not sure Im using the good kind of sensor at all of if I should change it, or if its something that can be solved in the code or so. Bear with me as Im just beginning to work with android sensors.p  pBasically, this problem is linked to an other that I have on a bigger application but I figured out it would be simpler to use this example to try and solve that. However, if you want to know what my problem is in my bigger application its essentially the same except that to move the cube, people can either use their fingers fingermode or the sensors phonemode. What I want is somehow to be able to rotate the cube with the fingers without paying attention to the sensors and when I go into sensormode that they do not change the orientation of the cube just because they are activated. Im not sure its clear, if its not, lemme know.p  pIm guessing, since i use touch to modify the rotation matrix that is used by OpenGL there might be some operations that can be done on rotation matrices to solve my problem. Or maybe its just a sensor problem. Maybe both actually I have no clue so far but these are the different solutions I have been trying to use.p  pThanks in advance for helping me figuring this out.p  pBest,p

I have set weights  distance and metric  minkowski.p  pOne requirement of my model is that the regressor should have an accurate output for any known points i.e. the points used to train the model. This is why we chose to use a distance weight, which weights training points based on inverse distance. A point and itself have a distance of 0, which means that if Im trying to predict y and theres some training point x such that xy, the model should give y a weight of infinity and fx  fy  but thats not the output Im getting.p  pWhy might that be Am I misunderstanding how python handles the xy casep

Negative 8661 pI use custom tags for my AWS instances. I am trying to list all the instances running and stopped in CSV file. Not being a programmer, I searched and copiedpasted codes and came with a script which runs well. But I have noticed that if one tag is missing then the script throws an error and stops right there. If the tag is created but is empty, then the script prints a blank space, but if the tag is not created at all then the script just stops. For example if the tag strongOwnerstrong is missing then it throws an error strongKeyError Ownerstrong and stops there. My script is pasted below. Can somebody let me know what changes I need to make so that if the tag does not exist, the script prints out strongNAstrong instead of stopping.p  precodeusrbinenv python import boto.ec2  from boto.ec2 import EC2Connection csvfile  openhomesbasnetScriptsInstancesinstanceseast.csv,w  def processinstancelistconnection     mapbuildinstancelist,connection.getallinstances  def buildinstancelistreservation     mapwriteinstances,reservation.instances  def writeinstancesinstance     if instance.platform  windows         platform  Windows     else         platform  Linux     csvfile.writes,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,s,sninstance.id,instance.privateipaddress,instance.tags[Classification],instance.tags[FQDN],instance.tags[Owner],instance.tags[RunType],instance.instancetype,instance.subnetid,instance.keyname,platform,instance.placement     csvfile.flush  if namemain     connection  EC2ConnectionawsaccesskeyidACCESS,awssecretaccesskeySECRET     processinstancelistconnection     csvfile.close codepre  pTIA sbasnetp
Negative 8661 pI must do many mathematic operations with the saved values in SharedPreferences. I use nonUI thread but the result took a long time.  How can I increase the performance My idea is to use data model class like database model. Then I can load all values from SharedPreferences to  this data model, after that I can run the operations.  Is this Idea a good practise or result a better performance if yes, how can I implement this model for SharedPreferences, with array, HashMap, Vector or something els And if some value changes, how can I implement a listenerp

Negative 8661 pI have done the code for the live calculation which means when the user entered data for all fields, the result will change accordingly. Then my page has a next button which let the user proceed to next step. If the user went to next page and wanted to go back to edit what he have entered, the result will be 0.00 but not the real result, unless the user reenter a value in an input box. Thus, what i want is just when user go back to the page, the result will remain what was showed.

Negative 8661 pI would like to perform automated, exhaustive model selection on a dataset with 7 predictors 5 continuous and 2 categorical in R.  I would like all continuous predictors to have the potential for interaction at least up to 3 way interactions and also have noninteracting squared terms.p  pI have been using coderegsubsetscode from the codeleapscode package and have gotten good results, however many of the models contain interaction terms without including the main effects as well e.g., codeghcode is an included model predictor but codegcode is not.  Since inclusion of the main effect as well will affect the model score Cp, BIC, etc it is important to include them in comparisons with the other models even if they are not strong predictors.  p  pI could manually weed through the results and cross off models that include interactions without main effects but Id prefer to have an automated way to exclude those.  Im fairly certain this isnt possible with coderegsubsetscode or codeleapscode, and probably not with codeglmulticode either.  Does anyone know of another exhaustive model selection function that allows for such specification or have a suggestion for script that will sort the model output and find only models that fit my specsp  pBelow is simplified output from my model searches with coderegsubsetscode.  You can see that model 3 and 4 do include interaction terms without including all the related main effects.  If no other functions are known for running a search with my specs then suggestions on easily subsetting this output to exclude models without the necessary main effects included would be helpful.p  precodeModel adjR2      BIC            CP          npred  X.Intercept.    x1      x2      x3      x1.x2   x1.x3   x2.x3   x1.x2.x3 1   0.470344346 41.26794246    94.82406866 1       TRUE            FALSE   TRUE    FALSE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE 2   0.437034361 36.5715963     105.3785057 1       TRUE            FALSE   FALSE   TRUE    FALSE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE 3   0.366989617 27.54194252    127.5725366 1       TRUE            FALSE   FALSE   FALSE   TRUE    FALSE   FALSE   FALSE 4   0.625478214 64.64414719    46.08686422 2       TRUE            TRUE    FALSE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE   FALSE   TRUE codepre

Negative 8661 pIm running into an issue with H5Validate where their events are being triggered after to the custom events I have implemented, effectively preventing my events from being triggered because theyre based on the H5validate events.p  pThe workaround Im currently using is setting H5validates trigger event to codechangecode or codeform.h5Validate change true code while triggering my events on codefocusoutcode. Although this works, Id prefer to find a method to allow my events to fire after H5validates so I can use the codekeyupcode event for more of a live validation feel and to ensure changes keep the button disabled prior to codefocusoutcode thus allowing users to move forward, not see the server side validation pop. p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdarcherufp056nh relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdarcherufp056nhap  pstrongEdit,strong it actually works occasionally. Whats the best approach to ensure my events will trigger after h5validates without doing something hacky like a codesetTimeoutcodep
