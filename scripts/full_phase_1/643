F has input 3bits and output 1bit.  The 3 input bits to F are selected from the righthalf of the input.  The output of F is a permutation of 00001111 so F is balanced.  The 3 input bits to F are selected from the bits on the righthalf so that each bit on the right half is used the same number of times or as close as possible to that.  Each F is generated randomly and independently one time.p  pNext I swap left and right halves of the result and do it again.  Again, new F for each bit with new input.p  pAll that is one round.  I do it 6 times, each round with random, independentlygenerated F functions.  6 rounds take about 3ns.  Ive tried changing the number of rounds and the number of inputs to F, too.p

Negative 643 pClient has a Report, Configuration etc properties. A client can have only one of each. Also, each report can belong to only one Client. This is in a way a onetoone relationship. Therefore my Report table has a foreignkey column clientID. Same for the Configuration and other tables. p  pNow as per the definition of onetoone that i read on the nhibernate site, it means that both the primary keys of Report and Client should be the same. Lets just assume that I cannot implement it that way. Hence to simulate the structure that I have in the database, I have the following mappingsp  pReportMapp  precodeReferencesx gt x.Client, clientID.Unique.Not.Nullable codepre  pClientMapp  precodeHasOnex gt x.Report.PropertyRefx gt x.Client.LazyLoad.Cascade.SaveUpdate codepre  pNow the problem I am facing is that when I query for a Client, NHibernate is also generating queries to get the Report, Configuration etc...

One for Report and one for Configuration. strongHQL generates a total of 3 queries.strongp  pHowever, if I use the Load method or strongCriteriastrong, it stronggenerates one query which joins all the concerned tablesstrong. p  pDespite mapping these collections to be lazy loaded, why is NHibernate fetching them I really only want information from the Client table. p  pWhats the logical explanation to thisp  pFrom the Nhibernate documentaion on fetching strategies, i understand that single associations are lazy proxy fetched. and that the default fetch strategy of select is executed only when the association is accessed. In my case i am not accessing the association. I am simply reading properties that belong to the Client.p  pAll this is so confusing...p  pstrongEdit1strong I have mapped my one to one relation as mentioned in the nhibernate documentation.  a hrefhttpnhforge.orgdocnhenindex.htmlmappingdeclarationonetoone relnofollowhttpnhforge.orgdocnhenindex.htmlmappingdeclarationonetooneap  blockquote   pThere are two varieties of onetoone   associationp  precode primary key associations  unique foreign key associations codepre      pAlternatively, a foreign key with a unique constraint, from Employee to Person, may be   expressed asp blockquote  precodeltmanytoone namePerson classPerson columnPERSONID uniquetruegt codepre  blockquote   pAnd this association may be made bidirectional by adding the following to the Person  mapping p blockquote  precodeltonetoone nameEmployee classEmployee propertyrefPersongt codepre  pSo technically as i understand, i am not doing anything wrong.

Negative 643 pIve got a collection of short WAV files that I would like to process in Java using various digital signal processing algorithms. I need to get an array of int valued samples for this purpose, encoded at the 11025 Hz frame rate.p  pThe source files have several different sample rates, including 11025 Hz and 44100 Hz. Heres the code Im trying to use to read themp  precode read the WAV file FileInputStream fileInputStream  new FileInputStreamnew Filetest.wav AudioInputStream audioInputStream  AudioSystem.getAudioInputStreamfileInputStream    copy the AudioInputStream to a byte array called buffer ByteArrayOutputStream bos  new ByteArrayOutputStream byte[] data  new byte[4096] int tempBytesRead  0 int byteCounter  0 while tempBytesRead  audioInputStream.readdata, 0, data.length  1    bos.writedata, 0, tempBytesRead             byteCounter  tempBytesRead  bos.close byte[] buffer  bos.toByteArray  AudioFileFormat audioFileFormat  new AudioFileFormatAudioFileFormat.Type.WAVE, audioInputStream.getFormat, intaudioInputStream.getFrameLength   get the resulting sample array int[] samples  new int[audioFileFormat.getFrameLength] for int i  0 i lt samples.length i    samples[i]  getSampleValuei  the getSampleValue method reads the sample values from the buffer array, handling different encoding types like PCM unsignedsigned, monostereo, 8 bit16 bit    RESULT the samples array codepre  pThe problem is, that the code doesnt handle different sample rates properly. So for the 44100 Hz frame rate I get four times as many samples as for the 11025 Hz frame rate. I would like the resulting sample array to use the 11025 Hz frame rate, regardless of the frame rate of the source file. I tried to force Java to convert the frame rate for me when reading the AudioInputStream, but I get an exception similar to the following onep  precodejava.lang.IllegalArgumentException Unsupported conversion PCMSIGNED 11025.0 Hz, 16 bit, mono, 2 bytesframe, 44100.0 framessecond, littleendian from PCMSIGNED 44100.0 Hz, 16 bit, mono, 2 bytesframe, littleendian     at javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStreamAudioSystem.java955 codepre  pI read the Java Sound API tutorial a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbookstutorialsoundconverters.htmlhttpjava.sun.comdocsbookstutorialsoundconverters.htmla.

Is there any way to do the sampling rate conversion on my ownp
Negative 643 pIm trying to implement a Hibernate persistence layer in a Java application and Im having some trouble with it.  Im encountering a no proxy error every time I attempt to access a simple, one way association.  I havent implemented Hibernate in quite the right way  I am using the thread method of Session control, which they do suggest you dont use for production.  However, they use it in their tutorials.  I am still trying to get the basics working, so I figured following the tutorials would be fine.  However, I cant get the simple association to work.   I have a class that looks something like thisp  precodepublic class Foo      private Long id     private String name     private Bar bar       Static Handler Methods  Ill flesh these out further down in the question.     public static List getAllFoo        Convenience methods     public String getBarName          return bar.getName            Accessor methods     public Long getId          return id           public void setIdLong id          this.id  id           public String getName          return name           public void setNameString name          this.name  name           public Bar getBar          return bar           public void setBarBar bar          this.bar  bar       codepre  pFoos Bar class is implemented as a simple oneway association.  Its in the .hbm.xml like sop  precodeltmanytoone namebar columnbarid notnulltrue gt codepre  pI create the Foos in a static method inside Foo like sop  precodepublic static List getAllFoo      Session session  HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory.getCurrentSession     Transaction t  session.beginTransaction     List foos  session.createCriteriaFoo.class.list     t.commit     return foos  codepre  pThe hibernate instance is configured to use a connection pool of 1 and uses the threading method for session handling like sop  precodeltproperty nameconnection.poolsizegt1ltpropertygt ltproperty namecurrentsessioncontextclassgtthreadltpropertygt codepre  pIm encountering a exception every time I try to access the association using the codegetBarNamecode function on one of the created objects.  Its a proxy error, it looks like thisp  precodeorg.hibernate.LazyInitializationException could not initialize proxy  no Session     at org.hibernate.proxy.AbstractLazyInitializer.initializeAbstractLazyInitializer.java132     at org.hibernate.proxy.AbstractLazyInitializer.getImplementationAbstractLazyInitializer.java174     at org.hibernate.proxy.pojo.javassist.JavassistLazyInitializer.invokeJavassistLazyInitializer.java190     at Barjavassist7.getNameBarjavassist7.java     at Foo.getBarNameBar.java126 codepre  pSo to make a long story short, this is what I started with and the error I first encountered.  Since then Ive spent the last several days reading the Hibernate docs and posts here to try and figure out how to make this work.  p  pWhat Ive learned  I think  is that Hibernate objects need to be connected to a Session.  Namely, the Session they are created by.  When I am creating my objects, in codegetAllFoocode that is the Session that those objects relate to.  In that session the Bar proxy exists and makes sense.  However, when I call codet.commitcode  because I am using the Thread method of Session handling  I am ending that Session.  The result of this is that when I go to call codebar.getNamecode later, bar is now an orphaned proxy.  It is a proxy whos session has been closed.p  pI found two possible solutions p  p1 dont close the initial session.  Leave it open by not calling codet.commitcode in codegetAllFoocode.  p  pThis worked  however, I dont think I can use it.  Im going to have thousands of these objects loaded at once.  They are going to need to stay open for an extended period of time while the user has think time  but I need to be able to access the associations freely.  And there may, in the future, be concurrency issues with database locks.p  p2 reattach the object to a new Session before calling on the association.  p  pThis didnt work.  Maybe I did it wrong  the documentation I found isnt clear.  I attempted to start a new session and call codesession.loadthis, this.idcode before I accessed the association. Like thisp  precodepublic Bar getBar      Bar tmp  null     Session session  HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory.getCurrentSession     Transaction t  session.beginTransaction     session.loadthis, this.id     tmp  bar     t.commit     return tmp  codepre  pI then modified codegetBarNamecode to call codegetBarcode instead of accessing bar.  This resulted in a new errorp  precodeorg.hibernate.PersistentObjectException attempted to load into an instance that was already associated with the session [Foo1] codepre  pI guess even after days of reading tutorials, posts and the hibernate documentation I still cant wrap my head around this structure.  So I ask StackOverflow to shed some light on this.p  pstrongFirst, if you can figure it out, whats happening in the code I currently havestrong  Is the session opened or closed  Why does it have a proxy error in the first method, but claim the session is still opened and the object still attached in the secondp  pstrongSecond, what is the correct way to handle Sessions  how do I actually make this workstrong  The way I think I want to use is session per request  that seems to be the most popular and applicable to my situation.  But then how is that actually implemented with associations and lazy loadingp  pYes, I know I shouldnt be using the thread method  but I have a whole other batch of questions related to JTA vs Thread vs Managed and this question is already too long.p

In some of my interfaces I do not want others to have access to the methods, but Java enforces them to be public. This is OK in my own projects but I dont want others to be able to access these methods.  p  pFor example, I have one interface called Sprite with some of the methods belowp  precodeSprite void updateRoom room void drawRoom world, Canvas c void updateHealth void updateLocationRoom room int getLayer void shoot void setDirectionDirection direction ... codepre  pThis is good because all Sprites need these methods but some of them such as draw I only want my Game Engine to use.p  pWhat are my optionsp

Negative 643 pI have an ArrayList to store some data, but whenever I remove an item from the list, the size does not decrease, even when I call ArrayList.trimToSize. This is causing me nullPointerExceptions.p  pHow can I remove a single item from an ArrayList and have the lists size shrink accordinglyp  pEDIT All right, heres the code. Heres a bit of background youll need to know, since I cant post all the code. I have an ArrayList called dataHeap and a HashMap called dataMap. The ArrayList is a binary Heap containing a findable object, which has a Key. The HashMap bind from a Key to the index of the object in the ArrayList. This is so an item in the queue can be found by item using the HashMap or by index using ArrayList. The Key can be any Object, as long as it is unique for every item in the queue.p  pIve debugged this line by line, and the Heap contains the object, even down to the Hashcode. The problem is, the Object is never being removed from the ArrayList. This must mean that dataMap.getelement.getKey is not pointing to where it should. Ive checked it though, I used a test object outside of my implementation that maps from a String to a custom object with String as a Key.p  pI make one object, with String one as its key. I insert it, then try to remove it. Ive stepped through this, and everything checks out, except one thing The object is never removed from the queue. Its got the same Hashcode, the same Key, everything. It gets removed from the map just fine, but not from the ArrayList.p  pHeres the remove methodp  precodepublic T removeT element      Well need this data to return the proper value     T t  dataHeap.getdataMap.getelement.getKey            this Swap call is used to swap our target with the end       of the arraylist. This means that whenever we remove it,       we dont have a change in indexes of the other nodes.       After that, we downHeapify to fix the whole graph back       to its functional state.           swapdataMap.getelement.getKey,length1     Remove from the Heap     dataHeap.removedataMap.getelement.getKey     dataHeap.trimToSize     Remove from the Map     dataMap.removeelement.getKey     downHeapify     return t codepre  pI hope this gives you a better idea of what Im doing wrong.p  pEDIT THE SECOND Holy crap I finally fixed it I pulled the dataHeap.getelement.index into its own variable. That solved EVERYTHINGp

Negative 643 pSo I have two tables, Questions and Answers, joined by a many to many relation table, QuestionsAnswers.  Questions have a Sort column that allows me to control how they are displayed to the user, and QuestionsAnswers also has a sort column that allows me to control the order of the answers for each Question.  My problem is that I am trying to write a SQL query that will select all the Questions and their Answers ordered first by Question.Sort and then by QuestionsAnswers.Sort.  Both sort columns are nullable and integers in these columns should take precedence over nulls.p  pI can get the Order By Questions.Sort to work fine but once I add in the second sort column, it goes awry.  For instance, if a Question has a Sort  0 meaning it should be the first Question displayed but does not have any preference for its Answers, it will get ordered below a QuestionsAnswers row that has Questions.Sort  null and QuestionsAnswers.Sort  0.p  pAny tips or thoughts if this is even workable would be great.p  peditp  precodeSELECT     Q.Id AS QuestionId,     Q.Name AS Question,     A.Id AS AnswerId,     A.Text AS Answer FROM     dbo.Questions AS Q INNER JOIN     dbo.QuestionsAnswers AS QA         ON Q.Id  QA.QuestionId INNER JOIN     dbo.Answers AS A         ON QA.AnswerId  A.Id ORDER BY     ISNUMERICQ.Sort DESC,     Q.Sort,     Q.Id,     A.Text codepre

Negative 643 pI need some opinions on what would be a good approch for using XML as data persistence for a small C app. This is a stand alone app, users do not share the same data persistence, hence, file access is exclusive. This is why I thought of XML in the first place.p  pI know my design patterns, so if I write the usual layers, I can isolate the persistence and then change it afterwards, if needed. Then again, its a small app, so I need to write it fast. p  pShould I just use Linq to XML and get over with it If so, what would be my rewriting efforts if I decide to replace XML with a embedded database Hows Linq performance in writing into the XML filep  pBut if I dont go with Linq, what would you guys suggestp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pBy the comments I got, I might need to specify a little more. This is a report card app for teacher use. These are my main entitiesp  ul liStudentli liCourseli liTeacher there should be only one, but Ill store it because of future integration possibilitiesli liGrade a student can have more than one grade in each courseli ul  pNow some questionsp  ul liUnder the hood, should I have one XML file per entityli liUnder the hood, should I use Linq to XML Is there something else to even be consideredli ul  pAnd some commentsp  ul liI understand that I should interface with the persistence class instance using codeIEnumerableltMyEntitygtcode, on either inputs and outputs. That gives me flexibility.li liAlthough Im really open to suggestions, I really do not want to consider embedding a database right now. This small app is an exciting opportunity to get to work and experiment with new things on production not only testing and little risk.li ul

The transformation between Transformable data and a UIColor instance works great once the color data is in the store already ie once the app has been run and quit once already. However when I first run the app and am loading in these values from a text file they stuck as NSCFStrings.p  pIn this line of code attributes is a dictionary has keys which are NSManagedObject attribute names and values that are the expected values for those attributes. In my color example the key value pair is color1,1,1,0.5p  precode[object setValue[attributes valueForKeyattribute] forKeyattribute] codepre  pThe value for color will now remain a string in this instance until its get transformed via my NSValueTransformer and then retransformed into a UIColor when the app gets run again.p  pI could just do the same transform here that Im doing in the NSValueTransformer, but this is in a utility class I wrote that could theoretically be used for any transformer. I also thought of finding a way to get all newly created NSManagedObject instances out fo memory thereby forcing the transformation to go through, but that just seems like a hack. p  pNote This hack works for me and lets me continue, but still feels ugly. Use NSManagedObjectContexts reset method if youre having similar problems  looking for a just work solution.p  pAny ideasp  pI have a hunch this is similar to  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1598600whyismytransformablecoredataattributenotusingmycustomnsvaluetransformeWhy is my transformable Core Data attribute not using my custom NSValueTransformera  but outside of the title our problems seem to be differentp  pHere is my NSValueTransformerp  precodeimplementation UIColorRGBValueTransformer   ClasstransformedValueClass      return [NSData class]    BOOLallowsReverseTransformation      return YES    idtransformedValueidvalue      return [value dataUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding]    idreverseTransformedValueidvalue      NSString colorAsString  [[[NSString alloc] initWithDatavalue encodingNSUTF8StringEncoding] autorelease]     NSArray components  [colorAsString componentsSeparatedByString,]     CGFloat r  [[components objectAtIndex0] floatValue]     CGFloat g  [[components objectAtIndex1] floatValue]     CGFloat b  [[components objectAtIndex2] floatValue]     CGFloat a  [[components objectAtIndex3] floatValue]     return [UIColor colorWithRedr greeng blueb alphaa]      return nil   end codepre

Negative 643 pI experienced a for me strange behaviour today Using QMake with the PkgConfigoptions etc. I was able to link the opencv libraries, but then I switched to CMake using PkgConfig. Once I tried to build my software, the linker complained that it was not able to find the library codelibcvauxcode, which pkgconfig returns asked to deliver the libraries for codeopencvcode codepkgconfig libs opencvcode.p  pIn codeusrlibcode I found a codelibcvaux.so.versioncode, but no plain entry codelibcvaux.socode. So what I did was to create a symlink, and now it works.p  pNow I wonder why it worked before. Is there something to pass codeldcode an option saying use the newest version, and you get the version by looking at the numbers behind the codesocode suffix Or is it more some kind of bug that the maintainers of the opencv package forgot to add this symlink Because e.g. codelibcvcode or codelibhighguicode have such symbolic links.p  pThank youp

So For Instance, the rtp lib that is asking for the data will only ask for 960 bytes 10ms of 48khz1 1channel16 bit depth but the buffers will be anywhere from 10ms to 26ms in length. It is very important that this pipeline only return 10ms per buffer. Is there a way to do this Here is the code that grabs the data.p  precodevoid GSTMediaStreamGetAudioInputDatavoid data, int maxsize, intamp written     if soundAppSink  NULL               GstBuffer buffer  gstappsinkpullbuffer GSTAPPSINK soundAppSink          if buffer                           uint bufSize  MIN GSTBUFFERSIZE buffer, maxsize                uint offset  0                 stdcout ltlt buffer time length is  ltlt GSTBUFFERDURATIONbuffer ltlt ns buffer size is  ltlt  GSTBUFFERSIZE buffer                        ltlt  while max size is  ltlt maxsize ltlt n                if maxsize is smaller than the buffer, then only grab the last 10ms captured.                I am assuming that the reason for the occasional difference is because the buffers are larger                in the amount of audio frames than the rtp stream wants.                ifbufSize gt 0                  uint offset  GSTBUFFERSIZE buffer bufSize                 memcpy data, buffergtdata  offset, bufSize                written  bufSize                gstbufferunrefbuffer                      codepre  pstrongUpdatestrong Ok, so Ive narrowed the problem down to the pulse audio plugin for gstreamer. The autoaudiosrc is using the pulsesrc plugin for capture and for whatever reason, the pulse server slows down after a few resamplings. I tested with alsasrc and it seems to handle the sample rate changes while keeping the 10ms buffers but the problem is that it will not let me capture the audio in mono only in stereo.p

Negative 643 pIm trying to use Ajaxplorer as a way to choose a file on the server and publish the file path in a form basically linking the file to a db record. I want the behavior to work like CKFinders popup functionality. I want the user to click a choose file button, Ajaxplorer appears in a new window, the user selects the file, and then the path to that file is sent back to the form and the popup is closed. Im pretty sure that this is possible because the CKEditor plugin for Ajaxplorer seems to do just that.p  pIm new to Ajaxsplorer, so I am just digging in. I was hoping that I could somehow pass a callback method to Ajaxplorer that would populate my field on select. However, it doesnt appear that I can do that based on the docs.p  pThe other option looks like creating a plugin. Im happy to do this, but the documentation is weak and it seems like others would have done this by now. So, before digging in to that for hours trying to learn the plugin system, I wanted to pose this question to the community.  Is there documentation or a plugin for Ajaxplorer that will allow me to send selected file info from a popup window back to my formp

Negative 643 pAssume a static library libfoo that depends on another static library libbar for some functionality.  These and my application are written in D.  If my application only uses libfoo directly, and only calls functions from libfoo that do not reference symbols from libbar, sometimes the program links successfully without passing libbar to the linker and other times it doesnt.p  pWhich of these happens seems to depend on what compiler Im using to compile libfoo, libbar and my application, even though all compilers use the GCC toolchain to link.

Negative 643 pIm currently having an issue where I am sending objects from one client to another over a network, and it seems that if the second object is sent instantly after, it seems to be overriding the first so it can therefore not be processed. However if the client emulators are both running on the same pc with the server this problem does not exist.p  pTo solve my problem Im thinking of using some form of collection such as a Deque to store the objects as they come in and then process them in order, removing them from the collection once they are processed.p  pIm just wondering if this a good method of sorting my problem, or if anyone knows what could be causing this issue.p  pThanksp

Negative 643 pi was wondering does it make sense to have a wordpresscompatible db for a rails app i currently have a rails app and its quite functional. one of my bosses suggested to delete my rails database on heroku and instead use a wordpresscompatible database. his reasoning was so that it would be easy to add a bunch of different plugins into the system since wordpress has so manyp  pi feel kinda opposed to this, wouldnt this require rewriting all my models not to mention, heroku uses postgres while wordpress uses mysql and also many other compatibility issues p  pdoes this make sense or should i just stick with the original database rails usesp  pmy site is mostly dynamic pages. we hope to eventually have a large user database, and also time is somewhat of an issue.p  pthanks  p
Negative 643 pSo the age old standard is that using Eval is bad because it can cause major security issues  especially in scenarios where you are evaluating something that potentially came from user input somewhere down the line. This makes 100 sense, and I have never had any problem avoiding the use of Eval. I was facing an odd situation recently, though, that sort of made me think about this type of thing a bit differently.p  pI wrote a JS function sort of likep  precodefunction someFunparam, callback      bool  someOtherFunparam     ifbool         callback     else         return false  codepre  pThis is much stripped down, but the principal is the same it calls another function and based on the return value of that will either execute a function provided as a parameter or it will return false. It made me think, though, that this sort of thing could be exploited just as easily as Evaltxtbox.value with the use of the JS console in F12. Does that matter p  pIn this world of F12, it seems to me like Eval is the least of our worries. Anyone who knows what an injection attack is is likely to know what F12 is as well. Am I wrongp

Depending on the value I want to distribute the objects to the sw components. That means objects with a greater value have to be preferred, objects with a lower value have to be neglected for example when all sw components cant take more objects.p  pIt is very important, that no object is distributed more than once. When one object is assigned to a sw component it must not be assigned to another sw component.p  pFurthermore I want to implement the whole thing as a distributed algorithm, that means without a central unit which executes that distribution.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 643 pIve been tasked to implement the loading of data from a flat csv file A to a SQL Server DatabaseB. Now, while Im a complete beginner with SSIS, I find it fairly simple to do the transfer. The thing is, the data from the CSV A has to be loaded in four different tables inside B, and I need to check the existing data before inserting.p  pFor example, there is a column in the A CSV named SERVERVERSION consisting in the structure  [SERVER].[VERSION]p  pWhat I need to do  1. Retrieve the server and the version as separate info  A simple trim  from the A column  2. Run a select query on the B version table searching for this info 3. If there are no results, I insert the info from A into B server table, which has a server column and a version columnp  pFLATFILESOURCE  EXTRACTSERVERVERSION  CHECKVERSION  INSERTVERSION SQLDESTINATIONp  pAnd I want to do this for every row in the CSV of course.p  pNow, my original idea was to use a Data flow for this verification, with a flat file source passing through a script component that would extract the server and the version from the flat file. But I feel this is quite a objectoriented method which doesnt seem fit to use in SSIS. p  pQ1  The data I get from the script needs to be used inside a SELECT Query for B. What is my best route to implement this  Can I output the results of the script to a EXECUTE SQL QUERY outside the Data Flow, or would I be better off trying the sql query directly inside the script  Im pretty sure that would not a correct way to go seeing as this is data analysing, not transformation. p  pQ2  Is there some kind of cachebuffer I can use to store temporary information such as the paired values of server and version  Can it be accessed globally  outside the dataflow p  pQ3  And then  I need to insert the rows that were not found in the database. Again, am I better off outputting the results of the SELECT query to a EXECUTE SQL task  How can I rig it the looping through the results and inserting the correct information.p  pNow, I have no problem creating the sources and destinations but so far not much luck in the script tasks and more importantly, what is the best way to run the SQL Queries I need, and then analyse the information inside them and act.p  pI know this is quite vague and sounds utterly more complicated than it really is,  but I cant seem to find information on this kind of operation. I see either the typical tutorial which does not cover this kind of operation, or technical questions that goes way beyond what I need to do. No one in my department has real experience in SSIS either, so I could really use a few tips. Im not asking for specific code, a few hints at how I could organize this would really help me out p  pThanksp  pPS  Yes I know it would be a piece of cake on a .net program p

Negative 643 pI recently joined a new team.  This team has been using Subversion for their source control.  They asked me to investigate the possibility of moving the source code to Git.  p  pThis seemed like a trivial exercise until I realized they have a large number of svnexternals.  The project is a large Java EE project that consists of several web projects.  The team uses svnexternals to share some fixed resources like css, javascript, etc. amongst the various projects.p  pMy question is twofoldp  ul liIs there a better strategy for sharing resources within a set of Java projects that we could consider, allowing us to remove the necessity for svnexternals and making the switch to git simplerli liIf no such better strategy exists, then what are my alternativesli ul  pThis is quite a large codebase lots of revisions and files so Id like to take advantage of the performance of git.p  pHere is the relevant software stack they are usingp  ul liSubversionli liEclipseli liMaven 2.2.1 IIRCli liWindows for development, AIX for productionli ul  pThanksp

Negative 643 pIm trying to use fsockopen to check if a Selenium Server is running. When the server is running the constant should be set. When its not the constant isnt set. This is done using the following codep  precodeifdefinedTESTSELENIUM     fp  fsockopenlocalhost, 4444     if fp  false          defineTESTSELENIUM, true         fclosefp       codepre  pThe problem comes up when the server is not running on Windows 7. Rather than fsockopen returning false from finding a closed port, it stall in trying to communicate with the port. When the server is running it quickly shows up using netstat. When the server is off netstat does not return anything from port 4444. From my understanding of fsockopen, this should then immediately return false. But again, it just stalls in trying to communicate with the port. I dont want to add a timeout here as this is not a point in the application that there should be a stall of any sort. Also, I should note that this appears to work the way I would expect it should on Linux. However, its failing here on Windows 7. Can anyone tell me what Im doing wrong Thank you muchp

Negative 643 pIm using the standard rails remote  true method to submit a form via ajax. I have a few input text fields in the form that are selectively hidden via displaynone depending on the circumstance. When those are hidden I would expect as is the case with a standard form post that they would not be submitted. p  pInstead, these fields ARE being submitted with the form somehow. Ive combed through the rails.js file here a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsjqueryujsblobmastersrcrails.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrailsjqueryujsblobmastersrcrails.jsa but havent been able to come up with a reason for why this might be happening.p  pIs this expected behavior for the ajax dataremote form post approach If so, I presume Ill need to take a different approach entirely or move those elements out of the form scope completely prior to submitting.p
Negative 643 pI recently encountered a very weird problem with report viewer Windows Forms. Normally the reportviewer behaves very well, loads fast and shows the reports nicely. But, we encountered a certain emscenarioem in which it to takes ages to show the report. I cannot post the whole code as it is not clear what causes the problem.p  h3The problemh3  pThe following method call causes the problem again, only in a very specific scenariop  precodereportViewer.LocalReport.GetDefaultPageSettings codepre  pIt can take up to 10 minutes for the application get past this line and in fact, if this line is commented out then everything starts working perfectly.p  h3The codespecialcode scenarioh3  pThe only difference in the special scenario that causes the problem is that right before showing the report some python code gets executed before the report is shown via IronPython and in the same AppDomain, the python code does not reference anything even close to reporting.p  h3Profiler, anyoneh3  pOk, so I run this scenario with a profiler Xte and noticed that the method codeIronPython.Runtime.PythonContext.LoadAssemblyFromFilecode is the one that freezes up. There is no explicit assemblyloads in python code we are running, so this is an automated assembly load.p  h3The weird parth3  pSo, the weird part that I cannot get is how are those two things connected I took a look at the codeGetDefaultPageSettingscode in ILSpy and saw thisp  precodepublic override ReportPageSettings GetDefaultPageSettings      object syncObject     Monitor.EntersyncObject  this.msyncObject     ReportPageSettings pageProperties     try              this.EnsureExecutionSession         pageProperties  this.mpageProperties          finally              Monitor.ExitsyncObject          return pageProperties  codepre  pAnd I can only guess that its the lock that is causing this method to hang, but I cannot understand how executing python affects this lock. I mean, it is absolutely clear that if I do not run the python code then this method executes perfectly fine without delays.p  pAnd by the way  after approx. 10 minutes the thing shows the report. It just locks up for 10 minutes and then continues normally.p  h3Suggestions on where to go from hereh3  pSo, I would really appreciate if anyone can give me any info on there should I go now. At the moment I am trying to isolate the case in a separate clean project and as soon as I succeed I will post it here.p  pThanksp  h3Update 1 Python script exampleh3  pSo far I only got one piece of additional information  this problem occurs even if you run a minimal script. So, even executing script code0code which just returns 0 the problem will occur.p  h3Update 2 Running in a separate domainh3  pRunning python in a separate domain did not help. The issue is still present.p  h3Update 3 CurrentUICulture is involvedh3  pDuring my debugging sessions I noticed at some point that in the problematic scenario AppDomain tries and fails to resolve the following resource assembliesp  precodemscorlib.resources, Version4.0.0.0, Culturefi, PublicKeyTokenb77a5c561934e089 mscorlib.resources, Version4.0.0.0, CulturefiFI, PublicKeyTokenb77a5c561934e089 codepre  pThis is the reason for the 10minute delay  it just tries to load that assembly over and over again both codeCurrentCulturecode and codeCurrentUICulturecode are set to codefiFIcode. If, however, I change the codeCurrentUICulturecode to codeenUScode then the problem disappears as it not longer needs that assembly.p  pBut again  the mystery still remains  if the codeCurrentUICulturecode is set to codefiFIcode and I execute any script via IronPython it will desperately try to load this resources file and fail all the time. If anyone is able to explain this to me  please do p

Negative 643 pI am trying to learn RavenDB and using its .Net client. If I am not wrong I think the main reason to use NoSql database like RavenDB is speed. It seems to be very fast as it is not relational. However when I am trying to play with .Net client of RavenDB I find that all calls are REST based calls. Doesnt that slow down speed For each call of adding document it makes some call to HILO which basically lets the .Net client know which should be the next unique number to use and then it makes 2nd call to store the actual document.p

Negative 643 pI am trying to write a basic Quadrenderer, using VBO, VAO, IBO and shaders. I am trying to use mainly only one VBO, VAO, IBO and rebuffer the data when an element is addedremoved.

Then if the user specifies the shipping address as Ireland, it will change.p  pIve also got a Shopping Cart Promotion which dictates that if the subtotal is greater than 15, and the user is not from Ireland, shipping is free. This works fine. The shipping costs all work fine, I just want to show it on the cart, based on being in the UKp  pIf I cant automated this, Ill be hardcoding the cost in there based on subtotal, which Id rather not dop

To make things more difficult, the localfile doesnt necessarily exist and the pathnameif given will be located on the server Im connecting to through a socket so checking if it is a file is out and checking the pathname is out.

Negative 643 pMy first question on stackoverflow, so my apologies if Im missing something.p  pI read in a reply in another J2ME transparency question from 2009 here at stackoverflow that You should note that alpha is sometimes ignored on some implementations and sometimes quantized to ugly levels Some motorola phones snap alpha values to the nearest 2bit value.p  pI am currently experimenting with transparency in J2ME, testing on rather new devices at least in the J2ME world.p  pThey all return 256 when I call Display.numAlphaLevelsp  pYet, I only count max 8 actual levels and mostly only 5 I can tell apart when I set an image to slowly fade in. And it seems it is, as the above quote states, the nearest 2bit value 1 visible at level 23 3 visible at level 47 6 visible at level 816 12 visible at level 1631 25 visible at level 3263 50 visible at level 64127 100 visible at level 128255p  pTested on Sony Ericsson Aino, Vivaz, and a Nokia N8, with both an 8bit PNG and a 24bit PNG. I consider those devices to be some of the latest models that can run J2ME.p  pThe above quote makes it sound like its not all J2ME enabled phones that behaves like this though. And thats why I ask my questionp  pCan anyone confirm that this is just how alphalevels are with J2ME enabled phones If not, then how is it set up on other phones, and which phones are they Do you know of any J2ME enabled phone that actually have all the 256 levels Or one that can give e.g. 75 visibilityp  pThanksp

Is this possible If so, what do I have to do and where do I have to do it p  pAlternatively, is it possible to have PHP code create the tables using the DB interface during the installation rather than relying on exttables.sql Again, if so, what do I have to do for this and where do I have to do it. p  pThank a lot Robertp
Negative 643 pIve seen lots of people talk about codegit rebasecode and what it does, e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2672351hghowtodoarebaselikegitsrebaseHg How to do a rebase like git39s rebasea and people talk about what it achieves gives linear history, e.g. here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5250817gitrebaseloseshistorythenwhyrebaseGit rebase loses history, then why rebasea But I cant fathom why you would want to do this.p  pIt seems like a strongbigstrong expense, to go back and revise your commit history which must surely involve some ugly merges with nway conflicts. And I could imagine cases where it could be very misleading, e.g. if two people solve the same problem in different ways, but the history doesnt show their work as having occurred in parallel seems that could easily lead to criticism and resentment too in some highpressure coding environments.p  pWhat you gain is an easier to understand, but incorrect, history graph. What makes that worth the effortp  pThanks in advance.p

And thus I am looking for a solution in stead of a work around.p  pIn short my numerical field items are invisible BY DEFAULT for some strange reason. Workaround was to make the items String values.

Negative 643 pHow far does one go to eliminate duplicate data in a database Because you could go OTT and it would get crazy. Let me give you an example...p  pIf I were to create a Zoo database which contains a table Animal which has a name, species and  countryofbirthp  pBut there will be duplicate data there as many animals could come from same country and there could be lots of tigers, for example.p  pSo really there should be a Species table and a Countryofbirth table But then after a while you would have tons of tables So how far do you gop  pIn this question I am just using one table as an example. One row in the Animal table stores information about a single animal in the zoo. So that animals name, species and country of birth, as well as a unique animalID. p

Negative 643 pI am writing a codedjangocode application where I have to save the timezone of each user in DB automatically. I have obtained the timezone through javascript and I am doing this in the home page. i.e whenever the homepage is loaded I first find the timezone through javascript, and then make an ajax call to the server with the timezone, and the server would would update the DB if there is any change. This way I would always have the current timezone of a user, but I am thinking would it increase the impact on DB too much or not p  pOne option I have is to do it only when the user logs in. But in that case the user would be redirected to the page he was before logging in, and I will have to put additional parameters to the redirect URL for the redirect page to decide if it should make the ajax call or not.p  pAny ideas My main question here is the first one would it make any serious impact on the DBp

Negative 643 pIm looking for heap structures for priority queues that can be implemented using codeObject[]code arrays stronginsteadstrong of codeNodecode objects.p  pBinary heaps of course work well, and so do nary heaps. Javas codejava.util.PriorityQueuecode is a binary heap, using an codeObject[]code array as storage.p  pThere are plenty of other heaps, such as Fibonacci heaps for example, but as far as I can tell, these need to be implemented using nodes. And from my benchmarks I have the impression that the overhead paid by managing all these node objects comes at a cost that may well eat up all benefits gained. I find it very hard to implement a heap that can comete with the simple arraybacked binary heap.p  pSo Im currently looking for advanced heap  priority queue structures that also do not have the overhead of using codeNodecode objects. Because I want it to be fast in reality, not just better in complexity theory... and there is much more happening in reality for example the CPU has L1, L2 and L3 caches etc. that do affect performance.p  pMy question also focuses on strongJavastrong for the very reason that I have little influence on memory management here, and there are no codestructcodes as in C. A lot of heaps that work well when implemented in C become costly in Java because of the memory management overhead and garbage collection costs.p

Negative 643 pWacoms drivers have always been atrociously bad, so Im currently working on a hack.p  pThe main problem Im having is with calibration on a tablet PC. And before you say anything no, just no. Ive tried literally dozens of drivers, and of the few that work, none allows calibration of Wintab input. You can calibrate MS Ink, but that does nothing for apps like Photoshop that dont support the Ink API.p  pHaving researched the issue a bit, the way I plan to hack it is by writing a wrapper for wintab32.dll which adjusts data packets as theyre sent to applications, enabling calibration and perhaps tweaks to pressure sensitivity and whatever else I feel Wacom should have supported all along.p  pThe calibration function is trivial, as is wrapping wintab32.dll and getting at the data that needs calibrating. As far as I can tell there are about half a dozen functions that request packet data, and Ive inserted code in each of them to modify said data.p  pIt works, too, at least if I test it on some wintab sample projects.p  pPhotoshop is different, though. I can confirm that it loads the wrapped DLL, opens a wintab context and uses the API to request packet data, which is then modified en route. But then Photoshop ignores the modifications and emsomehowem gets at the original, uncalibrated data and uses that. I can find nothing in the Wintab documentation to suggest how this is even possible.p  pIm pretty stumped. Any thoughtsp  pCould it be that Photoshop only requests packets from Wintab in order to clear the packet queue, and then does something else to actually read the state of the stylus And if so, what could that be Some secret, obscure way of polling the data using WTInfo A hook into the data stream between Wintab and the underlying driverserial portp

Negative 643 pI am writing some middleware for express.js 2.5.8. The intention is to amend the request object with additional attributes based on the session. I have unit tested the middleware function. Now, I would like to perform some lowerlevel integration testing to confirm that the middleware is being used by the express server.p  pMy typical approach to this would be to spy on the middleware function. However, this is not the most effective way of proving that the middleware is working as intended.p  pWhat I would like to do if possiblefeasible is load the application, inject arbitrary session data it does not need to be valid, requestvisit a test route which sends the result of the middleware. From there, I can make assertions on that result.p  pI have been using supertest superagent, zombie, and request for testing, each with varying degrees of success. What I am struggling with currently is the injection of session data into the request, in whichever form it will end up taking.p  pI would appreciate some guidance.

The table could have 10002000 records per year, and this could be in place in 20 years probably not with technology.  I could add a column for year and use that as a sort, but is it going to get slow when I hit 20K  40K worth of recordsp  pAnother idea I had is keep the active year in one table and archive all the history to another separate one Users dont care if history takes a few seconds to load, but not current datap  pThanksp
Negative 643 pTo elaborate on the situation We have two apps, lets call them A amp B for simplicity. Both developed and running on Windows 7 and they can connect amp communicate just fine using UDPTCP. Now we want to convert App B to Windows 8 to take advantage of the Metro UI. Will we need to make extensive changes to the networking code in App A Can it even continue to run on Windows 7 and yet communicate with App B running on Windows 8 From what I understand Win8 handles sockets a bit differently than the previous Windows, hence my doubt.p

The first plugin runs on the latest jquery. The second powered by an older version and so forth.p  pI tried to implement all of these into one html, but as soon as I implement script 2 underneath, script 1, then 1 doesnt work anymore, but 2 does. As soon as I implement 3 underneath 2, then 3 works and everything above breaks.p  pIs there a specific way to do this I have tried applying the noConflict code, but then the script which I assign it to, stops working. Unless I did it wrong. p  pI have though about using if statements to say, if varplugin 1 gets clicked, the cancel all other jquery and only play jquery for that particular plugin. And so forth for all the other plugins. But I am not sure if this will work.p  pI have also thought about using a seperate document.ready for each plugin, but again not sure if this will work.p  pIs there anyone who knows how I can solve this problem I have been battling this beast for the past 3 days amp nights adn will for ever be in your debt.p  ppsI didnt supply any code cause its just so much, and a little all over the place.

Negative 643 pIm developing some WCF services that are backed by a DAL that leverages the Entity Framework. The clients, services and the DAL communicate with one another via Data Transport Objects DTOs in the form of WCF Data Contracts. The Entity objects from EF are encapsulated within the DAL.p  pTo minimize the amount of data over the wire, I want to support the transmission of sparse DTOsa subset of the total fields in the objects.p  pFor example, say I have a DTO like thisp  precodepublic class widget     public string ID  get set     public string Name  get set     public int Amount  get set     public string Color  get set   codepre  pSay the original state of the object isp  precodeID  xxx Name  flux capacitor Amount  42 Color  purple codepre  pNow, the client may want to display a list of all of the widgets in the system, so requests a list of all widgets from the service, but requests only the codeIDcode and codeNamecode fields. p  pstrongFirst questionstrong How can I send a sparse DTO to the client in this case I know that DataMembers can be optional in DataContracts, but Im not sure what the code looks like to initialize that. Just fill in the requested fieldsp  pNow say the codeNamecode field in the UI is editable and a user changes the xxx widgets name. The client triggers an update from the service sending alongp  precodeID  xxx Name  a new name codepre  pAt this point, I want to be able to detect that only the codeNamecode field has changed and trigger the update on the Entity within the DAL. strongThe next question isstrong how can I tell that the client sent a DTO where only the codeIDcode and codeNamecode fields were specifiedp

Because cancelling is an asynchronous process, you will need to          wait for a callback          to paymentCancelled on your PaymentResultListener listener,          before being positive that          payment window is done cancelling.                  paymentWindow.cancelPayment         return true     default         return super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem           return the payment data instance that is needed as input to           link DibsPaymentloadPaymentWindowdk.dibs.android.library.PaymentData   private PaymentData constructPaymentData       IMPORTANT This needs to be set to YOUR merchant number, that you      have obtained through an      agreement with DIBS.      you can use the merchant demo for a demorun through the payment      window  read information about demo mode in the documentation       String merchantId       String merchantId  demo       The currency the payment is to be processed in     String currencyCode  DKK       You set this to your own orderId value     String yourOrderId  orderid       The amount to be paid, given in least possible unit aka oerer     long amount  new Doubletotal.longValue      The cards that is allowed to be used in payment window     ListltStringgt payTypes  new ArrayListltStringgt     payTypes.addMC     payTypes.addMTRO     payTypes.addVISA       this will add fee to the payment window.     boolean calcfee  true       In this example, we simply use PurchasePaymentData, which is a      simple buywithcreditcard flow,      where no preauthorization is performed.

Another, and maybe better, way to do this in an app, is to listen for      the proper callbacks      on the listener you set on the payment window, and then do your own      cancel or payment success      handling against your own servers.           try          paymentData.setCallbackUrlnew URL                 http.demoprojects.inaccept.php      catch MalformedURLException e           TODO Autogenerated catch block         e.printStackTrace          try          paymentData.setCancelUrlnew URLhttp.demoprojects.inaccept.php      catch MalformedURLException e           TODO Autogenerated catch block         e.printStackTrace          paymentData.setLanguageenUK     paymentData.setThemeTheme.ANDROIDDIBS       If you need to, you can pass custom options to the payment window,      which will be posted back again.

all different innodbflushlogattrxcommit settings. Im certain that my queries are optimal as they run very fast occasionaly, im almost certain that it has to do with my flushing. Ive also tried disabling autocommit but it still happends. Query cache is disabled. But any ideas are more than welcome. Maybe my disks are just to slowp  pThe system is not in production so i can restart it and test any suggestions.p  pPlease let me know if i can provide any more details.p
Negative 643 pI would like to find out which congestion control algorithm my computer is using. I know I can google it, but I want to find out by experimenting. My first step was to run wireshark when I downloaded a big file. Then I tried the IO Graph and got the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDvgm8.png altio graph from wiresharkp  pIs this graph typical for any congestion control algorithm I cant see any specific behavior  I know the following algorithms Tahoe, RenoNewReno and Cubic.p  pIs there a better way to find out which algorithm my computer is usingp
Negative 643 pI want to apply a generic design pattern for my DAO layer, such that I can switch between thirdparty ORM easily Hibernate, JPA, etc.. Apparently we have some common methods for all DAOs likep  ul lipublic void createT entityli lipublic void updateT entityli lipublic void deleteObject pkli lipublic T readObject pkli lipublic List readAllli ul  pAll DAOs have to inherit these methods plus additional methods specific for each DAO, I found the following design pattern suitable for me but I dont know how to use it in order to have all the common methods and the specialized one appear on the same DAO referencep  pFirst we will make an interface for all common methodsp    pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic interface

Negative 643 pWe have a bunch of services that support Post over HTTP similar to normal web app processing where in a form is sent via post and also SOAP over HTTP via the IBM soap gateway, our design is slightly messy today as we had combined a lot of processing logic tied to the transport protocol where we parse the XML contents via DOM parser and have seperate classes for Post and SOAP over HTTP, etc. We want to streamline this such that we have a common service class independent of transport that serves for both SOAP and POST over HTTP. I did find that Apache CXF supports both JAXRS and JAXWS via single service class. Does this mean I can use the JAXRS similar to Form posting over HTTP and JAXWS for the SOAP. The idea is we dont want to change any of the existing consumers client code and just stream line at the provider end. Any suggestion to this regard is welcome. Thanks.p

Negative 643 pWithin my Ember app, I have an object model, called Item, with a property price, which holds a float value, such as 20.5.  When I use the property in a template price, I would like for it to be formatted to look like so 20.50.p  pThis object is not the model that is tied to the controller at the route, but rather an element in an Ember Array, called items, which is a property of the model at the route.  So I have something like this in my templatep  precodeeach item in items   item.price each codepre  pThe problem seems pretty simple, but I cant really find a solution.  The idea is that I do not want to change the name of the property to get it to look the way I want, since I could make a computed property that formats the price property, but then I would have to use a new name in the templates.p

Negative 643 pI read somewhere that querying the data for other than RowKey and PartitionKey will result in a full table scan.

Say I create a query along the lines ofp  precodevar query  new TableQueryltMyEntitygt     .WhereTableQuery.CombineFilters         TableQuery.GenerateFilterConditionPartitionKey, QueryComparisons.Equal, pPartition,         TableOperators.And,         TableQuery.GenerateFilterConditionTimestamp, QueryComparisons.GreaterThanOrEqual, startTime codepre  pHow is this query constructed on the tables end Do I have control over which filter is applied first  is it the order of applying them, so in this case I would first get a subset of say.. 100k rows and then apply the Timestamp filter.p  pThe reason I am contemplating this to begin with is that I want to use both the PartitionKey and RowKey to store different data for separation, but I also need to be able to query by date as efficiently as possible. The system will have fairly heavy work load with a lot of requests like this so it is important that it works in a timely fashion.p

Negative 643 pI am trying to tweak the ui of a QComboBox in a way that the user can remove items from the drop down list without first selecting them.p  pThe background is that I am using the QComboBox to indicate which data file is open right now. I am also using it as a cache for recently opened files. I would like the user to be able to remove entries he does not want to have listed anymore. This could be either by just hitting the delete key, or a context menu, or whatever is straightforward to implement. I do not want to rely on selecting the item first. A similar behavior can be found in Firefox, where old cached suggestions for an entry filed can be deleted.p  pI was considering subclassing the list view used by QComboBox, however, I did not find enough documentation to get me started.p  pI would be grateful for any hints and suggestions. I am using PyQt, but have no problems with C samples.p

For example, if I loaded the page and switched the number of rows to display to 20, it would show 1 out of 1 at the bottom, and then if I set it back to 10, Id have 2 pages that I could switch through.

Negative 643 pSo lately Ive been playing around with my arduino and I was wondering if there was some way I could program the arduino in c. What Ive been doing is programming it using the cprocessing language in vim and using a makefile to compile and upload to the arduino. But my goal is to be able to use classes and all the great C features or at least sum to program it. Eventually I would even love to program it in raw c and Im just having troubles finding out how to do either. It would be great if someone could point me in the right direction or help me out. Thanks michaelp
Negative 643 pbr Firstly, thanks for reading my question.. I am newbie in programming servlets, and i have come up with this problem In my webApplication differrent users have access in the same variables and this is sth that i dont want to happen. I have the sense that i havent construct My webApplication well so i will present it. In my JSP pages when i want to call the servlet to do some process, i always call it with this wayp  precodelta hrefMyServletcheckgtSome Html Codeltagt lta hrefMyServletshowgtSome Html Codeltagt codepre  pI chose this way because i wanted to pass FROM the jsp TO the servlet a parameter in this case check, in order to inform the servlet hey you, the user clicked the button check  can i do this with another way Anyway So, in MyServlet i have written thisbrbrstrongMyServletstrongp  precodeimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet i import and many others..  public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet     private int count1 these are the variables that see all the users     private String Title      protected void processRequestHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse            responsethrows ServletException, IOException              ifrequest.getQueryString.equalscheck                  do some stuff and then put a value its not random in the count1                  count1  10 lets say this value its 10 for a user1.                  request.setAttributecount, count1                             RequestDispatcher disp  getServletContext.getRequestDispatcherpage1.jsp                  disp.forwardrequest, response                        else if request.getQueryString.equalsshow                  do some stuff and then put a value in the count1                  title  title same here                  request.setAttributetitle, title                  RequestDispatcher disp  getServletContext.getRequestDispatcherpage2.jsp                  disp.forwardrequest, response                   codepre  pSo in MyServlet i have nested ifelse statements for all the links in my jsp. As i said in the  beginning all the users in my application have access in the same variables. So if user1 after he clicked the button check the variable count1 takes a value 10, and then an other user2 clicks the same buttons and the variable takes an another value e.g 20, then the user1 has also the value 20... brbrI tried to put the definitions of the variables inside the method processRequest but then i have to initialize the variables firstly, as the IDE Enviroment i use, alert me that in the lines i use these variables that the variables may not have been initialized.But i dont want to init the variables, because everytime i call the servlet all the variables init and i loose the value that had before..brbrWhat should i do thanks a lotp

Negative 643 pId like to override the values of one time series with another. The input series has values at all points. The override time series will have the same index i.e. dates but I would only want to override the values at some dates. The way I have thought of specifying this is to have a time series with values where I want to override to that value and codeNaNcode where I dont want an override applied.p  pPerhaps best illustrated with a quick examplep  pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecode            ints  orts  outts index 20130401     1   NaN      1 20130501     2    11      2 20130601     3   NaN      3 20130701     4     9      4 20130801     2    97      5   should become              ints  orts  outts index 20130401     1   NaN      1 20130501     2    11     11 20130601     3   NaN      3 20130701     4     9      9 20130801     2    97     97 codepre  pAs you can see from the example, I dont think the codereplacecode or codewherecode methods would work as the values of replacement are index location dependent and not input value dependent.

Negative 643 pIm trying to solve a recurrence codeTn  Tn8  Tn2  Tn4code. p  pI thought it would be a good idea to first try a recurrence tree method, and then use that as my guess for substitution method. p  pFor the tree, since no work is being done at the nonleaves levels, I thought we could just ignore that, so I tried to come up with an upper bound on the  of leaves since thats the only thing thats relevant here.p  pI considered the height of the tree taking the longest path through codeTn2code, which yields a height of codelog2ncode. I then assume the tree is complete, with all levels filled ie. we have code3Tn2code, and so we would have code3icode nodes at each level, and so codenlog23code leaves. codeTncode would then be codeOnlog23code.p  pUnfortunately I think this is an unreasonable upper bound, I think Ive made it a bit too high...

Negative 643 pIm trying to build OpenCV 2.4.6 on Windows 8 in Visual Studio 2012. Having downloaded the source from a hrefhttpsgithub.comItseezopencvhttpsgithub.comItseezopencva I generate leaving the default configuration using cmake and then load the resulting file codeALLBUILD.vcxprojcode into Visual Studio 2012. I then try to build it. Several of the modules do indeed build e.g. core, flann, imgproc, ... but I am trying to build highgui so that I can use the PDB file for debugging my code which fails to open a video file. The build errors start with this and many similar errorsp  perror C2039 max  is not a member of std   COpenCV2.4.63rdpartyopenexrImathImathMatrixAlgo.cpp   1094    1   IlmImfp  pOne fix for errors like this e.g. in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma6570154575530this answera is to add codeinclude ltalgorithmgtcode to the failing files. I tried that on a few files and it seems to work but Im nervous about locally changing the source for a popular library. It must build on Windows you can download the binaries, though not the PDB files, from a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsopencvlibrarythe OpenCV sourceforge sitea so I would like to understand how to build it on my machine without changing the source.p  pAm I missing something out in the configuration step Is there some path setting etc. missing on my machine Why am I getting these errors and how should I fix themp  p EDIT p  pLooking at the directory path this appears to be a problem with one of the 3rd party dependencies, OpenEXR. Looking a hrefhttpsgithub.comItseezopencvtreemaster3rdpartyopenexron Githuba it appears to be version 1.7.1 of OpenEXR that is used in OpenCV 2.4.6. The instructions in the OpenCVs Quick Start a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsintroductionwindowsinstallwindowsinstall.htmlInstallation on Windowsa statep  ul liIn case of the Eigen library it is again a case of download and extract to the DOpenCVdep directory.li liSame as above with OpenEXR.li ul  pso I downloaded the a hrefhttpsgithub.comdownloadsopenexropenexropenexr1.7.1.tar.gzOpenEXR 1.7.1 source code releasea and extracted the resulting files putting the directory codeopenexr1.7.1code into codeCOpenCV2.4.6depcode.p  pThen I ran cmake and tried to build the resulting Visual Studio solution. Sadly I see the same errors.p
Negative 643 pI have a Rails 3.2.13 application where I originally used the routingfilter gem for I18n.  I plan to rewrite it in Rails 4.  I removed the gem since there is no Rails 4 production version available and I could not get the beta version to work.  I was successful in getting the routing set up for most of the application.  The only problem I am having is with my custom error pages.p  pI created custom error pages when I was using the routingfilter gem.  I need help on how I should set up my routes for the custom error pages.p  pHere is how I have the configuration in configapplication.rbp  precodeconfig.exceptionsapp  self.routes codepre  pHere is what I have in applicationcontroller.rbp  precode  beforefilter setlocale    def defaulturloptionsoptions       locale gt I18n.locale    end    private     def setlocale       I18n.locale  params[locale] if params[locale].present  cookies[locale]  en       cookies[locale]  I18n.locale if cookies[locale]  I18n.locale.tos     end codepre  pHere is what I had in my routes file when I was using the routingfilter gem.p  precodematch 404,                   to errorserror404 match 500,                   to errorserror500 codepre  pNow those statements are within the strongscope locale dostrong statement.  If I type the route that should appear when errors are found the correct page displays.  For example in development if I display codehttplocalhost3000fr404code or codehttplocalhost3000fr500code the French custom error pages display properly.  If I have en the English custom error pages displays expected.p  pWhat happens is when I get an error the locale is assigned to the error number.  Instead of displaying the proper error page the landing page is display where it attempts to find the translations for the error number which of course do not exist.  Im not understanding how the locale is getting set to the error number.  I would think that with what I have in applicationcontroller.rb that it should be set to I18n.locale.  I also tried changing the scope statement in configroutes.rb to the code below.  Both of them produced the same results.p  precodescope locale, defaults  locale gt I18n.locale.tos  do  scope locale, defaults  locale gt I18n.locale  do codepre  pWhen this quit working I added the strongrespondtostrong statements to errorscontroller.rb. However I still get the same errors.p  precode  def error404     pagetitle      terrortitle404     respondto do format       format.html  render status 404        format.any   render text t errortitle404alt, status 404      end   end    def error500     pagetitle      terrortitle500     respondto do format       format.html  render status 500        format.any   render text t errortitle500alt, status 500      end   end codepre  pUPDATE 10212013 10 am CDT GMT5p  pI have also tried the following within the scope statement and outside but still get the same error.  I have also used the match statements without the locale clause but get the same error.p  precodematch 404,                           to redirectlocaleerror404, locale I18n.locale match 500,                           to redirectlocaleerror500, locale I18n.locale codepre  pHow do I set the locale when errors occur  I have been searching for posts or examples where people are using custom error pages along with I18n but so far I have not found any.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

This event is fired    for any authentication related change, such as login, logout or session refresh. This means that    whenever someone who was previously logged out tries to log in again, the correct case below     will be handled.    FB.Event.subscribeauth.authResponseChange, functionresponse       Here we specify what we do with the response anytime this event occurs.      if response.status  connected         The response object is returned with a status field that lets the app know the current        login status of the person. In this case, were handling the situation where they         have logged in to the app.       testAPI       testFriends      else if response.status  notauthorized          console.lognot logged in        In this case, the person is logged into Facebook, but not into the app, so we call        FB.login to prompt them to do so.         In reallife usage, you wouldnt want to immediately prompt someone to login         like this, for two reasons        1 JavaScript created popup windows are blocked by most browsers unless they         result from direct interaction from people using the app such as a mouse click        2 it is a bad experience to be continually prompted to login upon page load.       FB.login      else         In this case, the person is not logged into Facebook, so we call the login         function to prompt them to do so. Note that at this stage there is no indication        of whether they are logged into the app. If they arent then theyll see the Login        dialog right after they log in to Facebook.         The same caveats as above apply to the FB.login call here.       FB.login                Here we run a very simple test of the Graph API after login is successful.     This testAPI function is only called in those cases.    function testAPI      console.logWelcome  Fetching your information....

Here are our main questionsp  ol liHow can we make our Pacman Fatman move smoothly across the tiles He moves tile by tile, but that looks unprofessional.

Negative 643 pWeve recently started to use the Google Play Developer Console for publishing Beta versions as well to a select group of testers.p  pThis is working fine, but weve come across a problem Beta versions connect to our Test servers and our Production version should connect to our Production servers of course.p  pBut when publishing to the Beta channel we cant just promote the Beta version to Production because then the Production app will point to our Test servers. That problem can be solved by creating a new version with a higher version code and pointing this app towards our Production servers so we always skip one version code every time a new version is published to Production.... p  pSo... what happens to our Beta testers that has their accounts on the Test servers, but accidentally or automatically update to the Production app  They lose their access to their Test accounts, because now their updated version of the app is of course pointing towards the Production servers...p  pstrongTLDRstrong How do you handle Beta testing on Google Play with both test and productions servers Should we use a different setup for this approach p  pIs Google Play Developer Console not fit for this kind of testingstaging Am I missing somethingp

Negative 643 pIm writing a code generation tool using VBA in Excel dont ask whylong story. I need to be able to parse a flowchart.p  pThe problem is that Excel allows shapes to contain text, with the exception of connectors lines and arrows cant contain text. To label an arrow, you just put a text box on top of itbut the box isnt attached to the arrow in a way that VBA can easily capture.p  pFor example, a user might draw something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhUnGR.gif altexample flowchart three boxes, two arrows, two more boxes as arrow labelsp  pWithin my VBA code, I can use codeActiveSheet.Shapescode to find that the flowchart contains seven shapes there are five boxes the two labels are just boxes with no border and two arrows. Then codeShape.TextFrame2code will tell me whats written inside each box, and codeShape.ConnectorFormatcode will tell me which box goes at the start and end of each arrow.p  pWhat I need is code that can deducep  ul liLabel A belongs to the arrow from Box 1 to Box 2li liLabel B belongs to the arrow from Box 1 to Box 3li ul  pI can think of three ways of doing this, none of them satisfactory.p  ol lipAsk the user to group each label with its corresponding arrow.pli lipFind out the coordinates of the endpoints of each arrow, then calculate which arrows pass through which labels.pli lipFind out the coordinates of the corners of each box, then calculate which labels lie between which pairs of boxes.pli ol  pMethod 1 makes things easier for the programmer but harder for the user. It opens up a lot of potential for user error.  I dont see this as an acceptable solution.p  pMethod 2 would be reasonably easy to implement, except that I dont know how to find out the coordinatesp  pMethod 3 is doable codeShape.Leftcode etc will give the coordinates but computationally quite messy. It also has potential for ambiguity depending on placement, the same label may be associated with more than one arrow.p  pNote that methods 2 and 3 both involve trying to match every label with every arrow the complexity is quadratic. Typical applications will have 1050 arrows, so this approach is feasible, if somewhat inelegant.p  pDoes anyone have a better idea Ideally it would be something that doesnt involve coordinate geometry and complicated logic, and doesnt involve asking users to change the way they draw flowcharts.p  hr  pEdited to add example 2 in response to Tim Williamsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2N5ec.gif altflowchart with one box, two arrows, and a label whose bounding box intersects the bounding boxes of both arrowsp  pHeres a label whose bounding box intersects the bounding box of both arrows, and whose midpoint isnt inside the bounding box of either arrow. Visually its easy for a human to see that it belongs with the left arrow, but programmatically its hard to deal with. If I can find out the coordinates of the arrows endpoints, then I can calculate that one arrow passes through the labels box but the other doesnt.  But if all I have is the bounding rectangles of the arrows, then it doesnt work.p

Negative 643 pI have a Windows application that interacts with some hardware.  A handle to the hardware is opened with CreateFile, and we control the hardware using DeviceIoControl.p  pIm attempting to update an application which uses this hardware to open the hardware in an exclusive mode, so that other programs cant access the hardware at the same time the hardware has mutable state that I cant have changed out from under me.  I do this by passing 0 as the dwShareMode parameter to CreateFile.  After making this change, I am still able to run two separate instances of my application.  Both calls to CreateFile in both processes are successful.  Neither returns INVALIDHANDLEVALUE.p  pI believe one of several things is happening, and Im asking for help narrowing the problem down.p  ol liI badly misunderstand the dwShareMode parameterli lisdwShareMode doesnt have any effect on DeviceIoControl  only ReadFile or WriteFilesli liThe driver itself is somehow responsible for respecting the dwShareMode parameter and our driver is written badly.  This, sadly, isnt totally unheard of.li ol  pstrongEditstrong Option 2 is nonsense.  dwShareMode should prevent the 2nd CreateFile from happening, DeviceIoControl has nothing to do with it.  It must be option 1 or option 3p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pIs the device driver responsible for looking at the dwShareMode parameter, and rejecting requests if someone has already opened a handle without sharing, or is the OS responsiblep  pIf the device driver is responsible, then Im going to assume 3 is happening.  If the OS is responsible, then it must be 1.p  pstrongSome additional Cluesstrong a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwareff55072928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowIRPMJCREATEa documentation suggests that the sharing mode does indeed get passed down to the device driverp

Negative 643 pHere is a class field,p  precodeclass someClass    Int someClassField  nil   ... codepre  pplease, please ignore issues of visibility, this question is concerned wih overall design, not language implementation If I look online at tutorials, I am told this field is safe to use by multiple threads. When the tutorials say safe, they do not mean that one thread can not interfere with the value visible to another. Such interference may be the intention  the field may be a counter. What the tutorials mean is, when one thread changes this field, the field will not be left in an unsafe state. Take this field,p  precodeclass someClass    ListltListgt someClassField  new ListltIntgt   ... codepre  pAs I understand, if the field is a simple list, one thread could leave it in an inconsistent state i.e. partially disconnected. If another thread uses the list it will fail  in a language like C this would be a disaster. Even reading could fail.p  pWell then, the class used on the field could be asked to copy out its state the copying could be extended to a full defence of immutability, but Im keeping the discussion simple. If the class copies out its state, then modifications are done away from the copy on the field, in a new copy modified for return. This new, modified copy can be reassigned to the field. But is that assignment threadsafe  in the sense that the value of the field can not be in an inconsistent state  because the allocation of the reference of the new object to the field is atomicp  pIm ignoring all issues of wether a language engine might reorder, cache etc. See the many posts below Java especially, it seems,p  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10675400threadsafecollectionwithoutlockc questiona has hintsli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10217844mutablevaluesinanobjectRule of thumb answersa in Scala, but seems to muddle linear synchronisation with outright disasterli lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13032766isreferenceupdatethreadsafeDark informationa on Javas thread visibility issue.

The client app should have the opportunity, if necessary, to prompt the user for a username to associate with their stronggoogle.comstrong login.p  pI dont know how to facilitate this.p  pIn fact at this point the browser ends up sat at the strongapi.prettypictures.comAccountExternalLoginstrong endpoint after the callback from Google. The API is signed in for Google but the client doesnt know how to deal with that. Should I pipe that cookie back to strongwww.webpics.comstrongp  pIn the SPA app, it is done via AJAX and stronggoogle.comstrong will return an token as a URL fragment and it all works nicely because it all sits on one domain.

Negative 643 pI am reading Modern Operating Systems 3rd Edition by A.S Tanenbaum, and Ive come to the chapter on virtual memory management. Ive been stuck on a part for some time now, and I cant get my head around it. Either, its a typo in the book, or I have misunderstood something.p  pSuppose we have a multilevel page table with two levels, where we map 32bit virtual addresses to physical memory frames.p  pThe fields for the page tables and the offset isp  precode10  10  12 codepre  pmeaning we have a top level page table with 1024 entries, and a page size of 4096 bytes or 4KB. Entry 0 of the top level page table points to the text segment page table, entry 1 to the data segment, and the 1023 entry to the stack page table.p  pThis is quoted from the bookp  blockquote   pAs an example, consider the 32bit virtual address 0x00403004   4,206,596 decimal, which is 12,292 bytes into the data. This virtual   address corresponds to PT 1  1, strongPT2  2strong, and Offset  4. The MMU   first uses PT1 to index into the toplevel page table and obtain entry   1, which corresponds to addresses 4M to 8M. It then uses PT2 to index   into the secondlevel page table just found and extract entry strong3strong, which   corresponds to addresses 12288 to 16383 within its 4M chunk i.e.,   absolute addresses 4,206,592 to 4,210,687.p blockquote  pWhen I translate the address to binary, I get code00000000010000000011000000000100code which for me corresponds to codePT1  1, PT2  3, Offset  4code.p  ol liAm I missing something, or is this a typo in the book stating codePT2  2code, when it actually should be codePT2  3code As the text later says, the MMU uses the PT2 index to extract entry 3.li liWhere does the 12,292 bytes into the data come from How is that derived from the virtual address I understand it has something to do with the offset, but I cant figure out how its done. As far as I have understood, the physical address is derived as a combination of the frame number from the second page table, and the offset. I see that the 12,292 is a result of code340964 PT2 entry  page size  offsetcode. Is this correctli ol

Negative 643 pI have built an advanced search option that allows users to search a multitude of different fields  38 possible fields in total.p  pOnce the initial search has been submitted, 10 results are displayed with pagination options at the bottom using grails codeltgpaginategtcode tag.p  pI think I have a few problems here. p  p1 I need to somehow pass the fields back to the controller using the codeparamscode attribute of the codegpaginatecode tag, but I dont really want to create a params map of 40 something parameters.p  p2 I pass back to the page from the Controller a map of search parameters so that they can have a dismissable list of parameters that perform the search again without the dismissed parameter. I can pass this back in the codeparamscode attribute, but its passed back to the controller as a codeStringcode and not a codemapcode so I dont know how to iterate through it I realised this after it iterated through each separate character.p  p3 The URL of the links that the codegpaginatecode tag creates could potentially be massive, depending on how much of the search fields the user enters. Could there be a danger of the URL exceeding its maximum amountp  pIm contemplating changing from the built in grails paginate functionality, and creating a form which I can POST. Im not sure if this is the best way though, and I may be missing some alternative way to do this that is much better.p  pAny help greatly receivedp

Negative 643 pIm making a camera app in iOS. Everything is fine except from the memory usage. This is the flow of the takeImageTaskp  pcodeAVCaptureStillImageOutputcode  codeNSDatacode  codeUIImagecode which I crop and do other changes to  save to codeALAssetsLibrarycodep  pI need to keep the codeUIImagecode in an array because I need to have them in a codeUICollectionViewcode, and I have the possibility to show the images in a big size view.p  pThis flow uses a lot of memory, so what I thought could be a better solution was to use the codeAssetURLcode I get from the codeAVCaptureStillImageOutput writeImageToSavedPhotosAlbumcode to fetch the images from the phone storage. My app also have the possibility to fetch images from the photo album by using codeUIImagePickerControllercode, and Ive noticed that this just uses a fraction of the memory compared to the takeImageTask. I first made the app as an Android version, and there I just stored all the URLs, and used them to present images. Does anyone have any experience using asseturls to present images in iOSp

Negative 643 pIve been struggling with getting tags to work with autocomplete mode for quite a while now, and it seems like my attempts have been futile. p  pI have two questionsp  ol liHow can I tell if autocomplete mode is working with gtagsli liHow do I setup gtags to work with autocomplete including the steps I need to do outside of emacs to get everything setup.li ol  pHeres my situationp  pI have a relatively large code base and I would like to index it with gtags, then use the gtags in my autocomplete for code hints. There are many levels of directories in the source, but they all belong to a root directory where I generated my gtags.p  pTo my understanding, if I have everything correctly setup, I should be able to type a few letters, and get autocomplete based on gtags if the source is within the directories that gtags indexed. For example, if I have saved my gtags by calling codegtagscode from the command line at the root directory like sop  precodeRootProjectDir  GPATH  GRTAGS  GSYMS  GTAGS   Folder1    mystructs.h  Folder2     somecode.cpp codepre  pWhere mystructs.h has something defined like...p  precodestruct testStruct     int a     char blahblah     double context  codepre  pThen that would mean that if I were to define this struct in somecode.cpp, autocomplete could attempt to complete my struct in the .cpp source. Is this correct In other words, if I defined codetestStruct mystruct  new testStructcode then the next time I call something like codemystructgtcode, the autocomplete dialog should pop up with the members of the structp  pMy toy .emacs file has the following bare bone autocomplete setup along with the correct load path. It seems to be able to recognize and autocomplete code from within the working directory. However, it doesnt seem to be aware of anything beyond the directory that the source is currently in. p  precode autocomplete stuff require autocomplete require autocompleteconfig acconfigdefault defun accommonsetup    setq acsources append acsources acsourcegtags codepre  pIve looked around a lot on the internet, but I havent really found any solutions. I saw a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions19708360autocompletionwithemacsandtagsthisa post, but the solution just says to add acsourcegtags.

Negative 643 pIm building a featurerich mobile website with jquery mobile. Accross all views there is some css transitions, boxshadows, gradients...p  pWhat im concerned about is users with lowergrade phones browsing my website. Plenty of phones support transitions but will display them at a terrible framerate  im thinking older Androids, first iPad, etc. So for this kind of hardware, i want to disable them as well as box shadow which is very expensive.p  pRight now what im doing is apply this rule depending on user agent  p  precode        boxshadow none important       webkitboxshadow none important       transition none important       webkittransition none important       moztransition none important       mstransition none important       otransition none important     codepre  pHowever this is totally unreliable  a phone with Android 4 will pass the user agent test yet might perform terribly. Not to mention users can upgrade their version of Android or even use custom roms on old hardware. And finally, they can always change their user agent.p  pAnother test ive been suggested is starting a widthheight transition on an empty page, then check if it completed in time. Altough i can see this working, Im not sure how reliable that would be since general use involves much more elements in the DOM.p  pI would like to add that i dont make heavy use of CSS3 effects and ive built this website with optimisation in mind, so please dont suggest optimisation or hacks like backfacevisibility, i know of that.p

Negative 643 pI need to annotate frontal or near frontal images using openCV. Im currently going through the OpenCV manual and the book Mastering OpenCV. This is the first time Im using OpenCV and due to that Im little bit confused with annotation and face detection.p  pI need to mark about 25 points in the human face. The required points are there in eyes, mouth, nose, eyes, ears .My question is p  pIs it necessary to detect the face first, and then eyes, eyebrows, mouth, nose, ears. Is it the case that then only I can proceed with annotation. The reason why Im asking this is that Ill be doing the annotation manually. So that, obviously I can see where the face is and then eyes, nose etc. I dont see the point of detecting the face first. Can someone explain whether face detection is really needed in this case p  pAccording to the book Mastering openCV , I need to do the following stepbystep.p  precode    1 Loading Haar Detector for face Detection     2 Grayscale colour conversion     3 Shrinking the image     4 Histogram Equalization      5 Detecting the face     6 Face preprocessing to detect eyes, mouth, nose etc.     7 Annotation codepre

Negative 643 pI know my question does look very weird but I hope I can explain what I mean and I hope you guys can help me. I got an Excel VBA code that is running without any errors. I copy from one file to an other file. The Problem I have is that I can see how Excel is switching between the source and the target file like flickering. I want the macro to copy from the source and paste to target WITHOUT switching between the files I DONT want flickeringp  pSo here I got my Excel VBA code. I set up a Button to run 2 macros. The first macro is an openfiledialog where I can choose a file to be opened. That is required because the needed file always got a different name and is in a different path. emI dont show you the macro because it isnt relevant for what i want to ask.emp  pAfter opening the file my second macro starts CopyPasteValues, the one I posted below. At first I set my source and target WorkbooksWorksheets and create an array with 16 account numbers.  Then I use the find method to search for the account number in each file source and target. The result of the find method is used to create an offset in the src file and copy it to an offset in the target file.p  pAs already explained. The macros run smoothly without errors. I just dont want the switching flickering effect. I tried multiple things and it seems like i cant find a solution.p  pThats why i thought Internet do your thing.

Negative 643 pMorning all I was coding today using a hash map and was wondering about the comparison of efficiency in a certain case that I hope hasnt been answered. Lets say I have a file of data where each line is an entry, and three columns with the following fields number of blocks, starting block, ending block. I use hash map where the keys are the three column data fields. I essentially can find out the number of blocks for each entry by taking the ending block of that entry, subtracting the starting entry, and adding one. For examplep  pNum of Blocks Starting Block  Ending blockp  precode    2           1          2           codepre  pWhich is more efficient to simply omit the num of blocks field from the hash map, and calculating it by map.getending block  map.getstarting block  1 which in this case is 211, or to simply store num of blocks in the map X number of entries and calling it by map.getnum of blocksp  pSorry if this is a dumb question as I am only a little bit experienced in using hash maps.p

Negative 643 pI am looking for some help setting up a multidatacenter cassandra cluster.  My current setup is MySQL master  slave where MySQL replicates to a disasterrecovery center over the public IP of the remote datacenter and communicates with slaves in the main datacenter via the private IPs.  While VPNd into the network I can connect to any database via the public IP which is nice for testing  troubleshooting and app servers connect to the database via private IPs.p  pWith Cassandra the disaster recovery center would become a second datacenter.  Im hoping to get advice on how each datacenter should be configured.  Im a bit confused over the listenaddress and the broadcastaddress.  Currently, the seeds in the cassandra.yaml file are the public IPs and everything else is the private IP and this works for the app servers.  If the rpcaddress is configured with the private IP or public IP then connections are only accepted on that address.  Connections are accepted via both if the rpcaddress is 0.0.0.0 but, in my testing, that causes failover to fail.  I have a java program running that inserts a row and reads it back in a loop.  If the rpcaddress is a specific address I can stop a node and the program continues replication factor of 2 for testing.  If the rpcaddress is 0.0.0.0 then the program bombs because it cannot connect to the cluster even tho both node addresses are specified in the Cluster constructor.p  pSo, with that long lead in, my questions arep  ol lipWhat is the recommended configuration for the nodes to communicate with one another over the private IP for a given datacenter but also communicate to the other datacenter over the public IP.  It seems the EC2 Multi snitch accomplishes this but were not on Amazons cloud so the code seems specific to amazon.pli lipFor development and debugging, can developers VPN into our network and connect via the public IP and have the app servers connect on the private IP  This works fine with rpcaddress of 0.0.0.0 however failover doesnt work which was not unexpected given the warning comment in the cassandra.yaml file.pli ol  pI really appreciate the help.p  pThanks, Gregp

Negative 643 pIm hoping that someone may be able to help me.p  pMy question relates to SISS, specifically the Lookup Data Flow Item and how it handles NULL values depending on the selected Cache Mode.p  pI have a very large dataset 72 columns, 37,000,000 records which uses a Type 2 update methodology.  p  pI use a lookup in the data flow to identify updates to existing record, I match on all of the relevant fields and if all the fields match then obviously the incoming record matches the existing record in the table and it is therefore discarded.  If there isnt a match then a type 2 update is performed.  p  pDue to the large dataset and limited server resources if the Cache Mode of the Lookup is set to Full Cache, it causes the process to fail due to insufficient memory I have therefore had to switch the Cache Mode to Partial Cache.  This resolves the memory issue, but causes another issue.  For some reason in Partial Cache mode a NULL value from the table does not match a NULL value in the incoming records, while if the Cache Mode is set to Full Cache then it does.p  pThis behaviour seams quite odd and I am unable to find it documented anywhere.  One way round it could be to coalesce the NULL values, but this is something I would like to avoid.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p  pCheers Benp

Negative 643 pI have a partitioned table with a BLOB column. When multiple rows per transaction is deleted from this table by multiple users, we often run into ORA00060 deadlocks, which, according the trc files, are caused by ITL deadlocks in the emLOBem index partitions.

I can do that for a nonpartitioned table with codecreate table ...  ... lob ... store as ...  ... index ... ... initrans 10 ...   code, but for the partitioned table Oracle says  ORA22879 cannot use the LOB INDEX clause for partitioned tables.

Negative 643 pI have a tableview which contains cells that are full screen fullScreenTableView with a fullScreenTableViewController, and the scroll view is paginated, which scrolls vertically. The cells act as different screens and you swipe vertically to move between them.p  pIn the top cell, I have a tableview which acts as a chat log chatLogTableView and chatLogTableViewController, so it gets long enough to need to scroll as well. When you scroll up beyond codecontentOffset  0code, I still want the content to bounce. p  pWhen you scroll to the bottom past the content of the chat log, I want to resign the chatlog as the active scroll view and instead be scrolling the parent tableView, in order to navigate between screens.

Negative 643 pI am currently exploring the gbm functions in the package dismo to create boosted regression trees for species distribution modeling. I have been using the dismo vignettes as well as the 2008 paper A working guide to boosted regression trees by Elith et al., published in the Journal of Animal Ecology. On page 808809 of the Elith et al. article, the authors explain partial dependence plots and give an example at the bottom of page 809 Fig. 6. According to the dismo vignette Boosted Regression Trees for ecological modeling, gbm.plot Plots the partial dependence of the response on one or more predictors. p  pGbm.plot creates plots that look almost exactly like the example in Elith et al.. However, there are a few parameters I cannot figure out how to set to achieve a figure the exact same as in the paper.p  ol lipThe yaxes in the paper are on the logit scale and are centered to have a zero mean over the data distribution. The yaxes in gbm.plot represent the fitted function.pli lipThe rug in the paper is on the top of the plots, gbm.step the rug is  on the bottom.pli lipGbm.plot uses the variable name as the xaxis label.

Negative 643 pI have been working on a project for a couple months now and I am nearing the end of it. One of the last steps is to provide a file which will be filled with information which has been generated by actions of the user during their session. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4309958caniwritefileswithhtml5jsCan I write files with HTML5JSa and the answer by ecmanaut has gotten me very close since he provided two methods of doing so, one in pure html5 and one using JavaScript.p  pI had first used the JavaScript method which would only work in Chrome, not in Mozilla or IE. So I used the pure html5 method combined with some alternate JavaScript to paste it to the page so it was clickable.p  precodedocument.getElementByIddownload.innerHTML  lta idsave downloadearth.txt hrefdatatextplain,mostly harmlessamp10and a bit moregtSaveltagt codepre  pThis code creates a file which is downloaded, but does not contain the newline which the article said was 10. So I did a search to see what other character codes could be recognized. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNewlinehttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNewlinea provided me with many possible choices, none that I have tried have worked. The ones I have tried are amp10, 10, amp13, 13, rn, r, n, cr, cr, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0c0D0A. In many of the cases the newline was removed and nothing would appear.p  pWhile testing the above code, it works in Mozilla and Chrome minus the newline, but the result in IE is different. When you click on the Save link, it actually moves to the page and has the url as what the data contents are.p  pWhile the project might be acceptable without this feature working, I would very much like to get it working after having spent so much time and effort on it and having gotten so close. I also need to test this in Safari but I have not done any testing in that browser yet. Browser support required from most important to least is as follows Mozilla, Chrome, Safari, IE. If possible I would like to avoid browser specific coding.p  pI should also mention that like in the first link, I do not want to send to a server to have the download, I need it working locally on the client side with no server interaction.p  pSo to sum up, I need at least to get the newline working for the file so that Mozilla and Chrome are both fully working. And if possible, a way to get the file working in IE as well.p  pEdit Nov 3, 2014 140pm Local Time I have tried the suggested edit by maths4js about changing around my quotes and the suggestion did not work. It came to my attention that submitting a larger sample page of code would be a helpful idea.

Negative 643 pFor example, lets say we have a bounded 2D grid which we want to cover with square tiles of equal size. We have unlimited number of tiles that fall into a defined number of types. Each type of tile specifies the letters printed on that tile. Letters are printed next to each edge and only the tiles with matching letters on their adjacent edges can be placed next to one another on the grid. Tiles may be rotated.p  pGiven the size of the grid and tile type definitions, what is the fastest method of arranging the tiles such that the above constraint is met and the entiremajority of the grid is covered strongNotestrong that my use case is for large grids 20 in each dimension and mediumlarge number of solutions unlike Eternity II.p  pSo far, Ive tried DFS starting in the center and picking the locations around filled area that allow the least number of possibilities and backtrack in case no progress can be made.

Negative 643 pI have some questions about memory management.p  pI am building a photo editing app. So keeping memory usage low is important. Also I am not going to post code because I do not have a big memory leak when doing one specific thing. I just lose a couple of KBsMBs with everything that happens. And going over tens of thousands of lines of code to find kilobytes is no fun p  pmy app uses core data, lots of cifilter stuff, location, and the basicsp  pWhat I do now just to check if I got this right...p  ul lideclare everything that isnt a bool or simple string as an optional.li liset these to nil on segue or when they are no longer needed.li lidismiss views, dont use endless segues.li ul  pI do this no matter the scope. First I declared as much as possible inside functions and this worked great with ARC until it didnt... ARC releases that data, but only when it is already too late. So when you are using about 100mb of Ram and then do something memory intensive, the app will crash because ARC only really steps in when the memory pressure is beyond a certain threshold and the app is idle. or did I get this completely wrongp  p my understanding of ARC was wrong. ARC only marks memory space as available when stuff becomes nil or is deinitialised.p  ul liuse functions as parameters to other functionsli ul  pInstead of creating a variable or a constant with the outcome of a function, I just use the function directly as the parameter. This way there is not another variableconstant that holds data until ARC steps in or I set it to nil. if the outcome of one function is used more than once, I do store it in a variable....p  hr  pWhat I noticed after implementing this almost completely p  ul lipmemory usage is around 30mb at idle, around 100 under load. this is awesomepli lipARC frees up memory when the app is idle even when the usage is only around 50mb.pli lipMemory still disappears. most legible thing that still eats memory in instruments  nsmutabledatagrowbytes This might be because I havent fully implemented this method, or because there is still memory being eaten...pli ul  hr  pUpdate  p  ul lipWhen working with images make sure you call this  p  pcodeUIGraphicsEndImageContextcodepli lipCreate one codeMOCcode as an optional, give value on codeViewDidLoadcode.pli liPut fetches in a separate file super easy to fix bugs li liLoad Core Data ManagedObjects into structs to use the data and reset the MOC after the fetch. This is a super easy trick to make sure you dont get strong reference cycles and you cant accidentally alter your saved data.li ul  pstrongMemory usage is at 8mb now and around 30 under heavy load.strongp  hr  pUpdate 2 p  pIn a photo app I noticed that despite all the right tricks, I still get memory issues. Instruments is no help because the memory is released. I believe it has to do with the way memory is allocated. p  pThis only happens when processing multiple images without pause. So I suspect problems occur when an image with a slightly smaller file size is done processing and the next one is just ever so slightly bigger. Instead of using the same part of the Ram it goes in the next available slot. The OS only cleans this up when idle. All the right code, but ram usage easily triples and crashes the app.p  pThis issue is much closer to the hardware side of things and although I know a solution, it is also a problem in itself. If I first save an image with random noise this is hard to compress and results in a bigger file size I will reserve a big enough space for the real images. Obviously this is not at all future proof, and only works if my suspicions are correct. p  pI also only thought of it because it is a known trick with memory cards in digital cameras. First fill the card with random data and delete this. This ensures continuous empty memory and allows more images on the card.p  pI decided to use a Timer to create idle time. This trades apparent performance for stability. But if you base your interval on the first process and then add a few fractions of a second, you can keep this to a minimum.p  hr  pUpdate 3 p  pAvoid changing types like thisp  precodelet myInt  Int  1 let myFloatFromAnInt  Float  FloatmyInt codepre  pThis creates a new float with the int as the value and writes it to new memory.p  pTry casting insteadp  precodelet myFloatFromAnInt  Float  myInt as Float codepre  hr  pstrongSo now the big questionstrongp  pMy first view is just a tableview which costs me about 5mb of memory. Then you take some photos, apply some filters, this gets saved to core data and then you go back to that first view. p  pstrongIs it possible to truly get rid of everything in memory except for the data needed to drive that first view. that very save and awesome 5mbstrong p  pOr will there always be something left behind, even if you set everything to nilp  pOne thing I was wondering for example was what happens with the data from a class file after you segue away from it. My guess is that these get marked to be released when ARC feels like doing something, but that the data is all still there unless you set it to all to nil before the segue...p  pstrongIf after reading all the updates the message wasnt clear yet It is possiblestrongp  pstrongQuick recap of the essentialsstrongp  ul lidont forget to dismiss view, noob mistake, but still happens to people.li lideclare stuff as optionalsli liset stuff to nil when no longer neededli licreate idle time for the OS to actually clean up memoryli lidont forget that classes are reference types and can be passed on without increasing memory.

Negative 643 pIm very new to MVC, and dont know the best way to approach this.  Id like to have a highly responsive app, and therefore considered having the Parent views simply as wrappers that had some very basic content no EF Entity retrieval,and all the logic inside of a partial view, so that a nice loading animation can be displayed when actual long loading operations take place.p  pThrough this process, I have discovered that when I pass a ViewModel, as well as ViewBag variables from the Partial Views Controller Action, I am not able to access these from the Partial View.p  pAm I using partial views totally wrongbr Is there another method to display a loading animation while while the controller is retrieving data from the databasep  pInitially, I had everything working in a single Index view, and some jquery calling window.load to display a div with a loading animation, but I was under the impression that window.load will not fire until the controller is done doing its data retrieval and passes it to the view.  Am I correct here  Is there a better way of doing thisp

Negative 643 pWhat is the best way to convert a byte array to a string with a radix of choice There is a ton of examples here on S.O. and elsewhere to convert to a hex string. What I am mainly interested in here is converting to something strongemotheremstrong than a hex or decimal string also a more generic way. p  pThis is what I currently dop  precodebyte[] input String MyStr  new BigIntegerinput.toStringradix codepre  pThis works, but since Java has a concept of radix, as used in the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangInteger.htmlparseInt28java.lang.String,20int29 relnofollowIntegera. This seems to be the explicit purpose as defined in a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangCharacter.htmlMAXRADIX relnofollowCharactera. Shouldnt there be a better way of doing this rather than to first convert the byte array to a BigInteger It feels like my Java knowledge misses some essential standard classp  pEDIT I would like to use this for a compressed way of representing and printing raw binary data of different types. This is the actual radix I currently usep  precodeString MyStr  new BigIntegerdata.toStringCharacter.MAXRADIX codepre  pThe MAXRADIX 36 uses a combination of lower case letters and numbers. This gives a decent compression, but would be even better if the radix could include UPPER letters, which is why I thought I may be missing something. p

Negative 643 pI am trying to do a performance benchmark on C11s stdunorderedmap container.p  pI want to see how the load factor of the container affects performance for insertions. Specifically because I am interested in using a hash table as base data structure for finding pairs in a huge set of numbers.p  pAs I understand the documentation, this does not seem possible. I can set the amount of buckets with a coderehashcode but this is done automatically any time the codemaxloadfactorcode is exceeded. p  pI can set the codemaxloadfactorcode but as I understand it, this only determines emwhenem a rehash is performed, it does not allow the table to be placed under heavy strain, which is what I want to do.p  pIs there any way for me to hard limit the amount of buckets in a hash tablep

Negative 643 pI made a new Project in Android Studio and MainActivity extends android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity by default.

Negative 643 pI want to decode Mp3 to PCM samples using NAudio.p  pWhat I am looking at is only decoding about 5 seconds of audio data from the current music position.p  pOnce this decoding is done and the music position moves past it, the next 5 seconds must be decoded and previous data must be discarded.p  pThe reason for doing this is, I just want to buffer a small section of decoded PCM data and not the whole data, since the full decode would occupy more meory and is not needed once the audio position moves past it.p  pFor example The audio file is 22 seconds long.p  pThe decoding to PCM must happen as followsp  ol liMusic position between 0 to 5 seconds buffer 0 to 5 seconds of decoded datali liMusic position between 5 to 10 seconds buffer 5 to 10 seconds of decoded data and discard previous datali liMusic position between 10 to 15 seconds buffer 10 to 15 seconds of decoded data and discard previous datali liMusic position between 15 to 20 seconds buffer 15 to 20 seconds of decoded data and discard previous datali liMusic position between 20 to 22 seconds buffer 20 to 22 seconds of decoded data and discard previous datali ol  pMy query is  p  ul liHow much PCM data samples must be decoded and added to the buffer at a time such that the decoded data is always available to be read while the music is being played.li liIs there any exact bytes of data to be considered or the BufferedWaveProvider would take care of leftoversli liShould the buffer be cleared and refilled once the 5 seconds data is consumedli liHow can the Read operation be performed since there is a limited buffer size So the music position has to be translated to the position within buffer size.li ul  pI tried to setup a BufferedWaveProvider in conjunction with MediaFoundationReader to read the decoded data however I am running into Buffer full exception.p

Negative 643 pafter a LOT of hours researching solution to this problem and havent found it yet, thought maybe you can help me...p  pIm trying to automate mail migration process, in the client side Im creating outlook profile file PRF file, from the office customization tool, then update the settings etc. at the end im exporting the data to pst with the outlook com objectoutlook.interop so far so good, the thing is when Im creating a profile and launch outlook i get the ask for credential window to enter the userpass, if I check the remember password, windows then save it to the vault credentials.p  pNow I want to precreate the credential prior to the launch of outlook so outlook start without asking for the credentials and find it in the vault, but when I manually creating a credential in the vault, outlook not using it and asking for password, I try with cmdkey genericMS.Outlookuserdomain.com useremail passpass not working, what I figured out is when I save a password through the outlook credential dialog it encrypt it with that specific user key, so other users cant see it, and vice versa when I manually create a credential it use the current logged on user as the key for encryption so when outlook open it not recognized the password, so I think that this is the reason why is not working, same like powershell securestring working just on the current user that encrypted it. but thats only my opinion so farp  pSo, maybe one of you knows how top  pautomate the creation of credential and link it to the outlook profileaccount, or create a credential as different user, also, I thought of invokecommand as different user and then execute the cmdkey but the computer domain is not the same as my localcomputer,p  pAny idea is welcome, also through the outlook com object if possible, registry, script whatever,  really important to my project, at the meanwhile I use the shell.sendkey to automate the fill of the user password but its really not stable solution.p

Negative 643 pSorry if this is a dumb quesiton, This is my first attempt at python.  I wrote a script that reads a list of interfaces from a file, logs into cisco 7600s and then calls a function that pulls the status and runningconfig of the interfaces.  I run 2 commands on each interface.  The problem is managing the pexpect output.  Some of the interfaces it does exactly what I expect no pun intended and others, it doesnt seem to wait for any ouput at all, still others  the output from one command ends up showing up after 2 or three other interfaces have been checked.  Right now I just have it all outputting to sys.stdout.  Once I get it working I will write it out to a file.  Ive tried using sendline instead of send, Ive played with child.timeout, child.maxsize, time.sleep ... I can post output upon request.  Im just trying to keep this from being too long.

The idea is to create a animation of a rabbit running from one side of the page to another when the user clicks on a button.p  pSo, what Ive found so far are libraries that transform images, and allow me to move them, but what I really need is to get the images changing while lets say I have a div in which the rabbit images are placed the rabbit is moving.p  pimgs     rabbitimage1.jpg     rabbitimage2.jpg     rabbitimage3.jpg     rabbitimage4.jpg     rabbitimage5.jpg     rabbitimage6.jpgp  pOnce I start to move the  from one point of the page to another, I would like these the images to loop until the  reaches the ending position, giving a feeling of a running rabbit.p  pAny suggestions Thank you in advance.p

Negative 643 pMy understanding of iOS SIP application or say VOIP application isp  pIt is a persistent TCP connection between server amp device. As soon as call request comes it establishes RTP connection with server to other devices. Now you can exchange voice or other packets on this connection amp have a real time call.p  pWith Push Kit framework, I am confused that how exactly it is suppose to workp  pQuestionsp  ol liWhen app goes to background is My VOIP TCP connection still there or it is closedli liIf it is closed, after getting VOIP APNS, how exactly the SIP protocol works with out its main TCP connectionli liDo we have to establish connection when a VOIP APNS comes in What if at that time establishing TCP fails due to some reason.li liWhat kind of changes we have to do in SIP server to achieve thisli ol  pMay be my whole understanding is wrong here. But I want to know the flow architecture about how exactly a VOIP application works with APNS.p  pI tried looking into various articles over internet, but all I understood about PushKits VOIPAPNS is that it will wakeup your application in background, but they fails to clarify my above questions.p  pCan anyone throw some light on this topic please.p

Negative 643 pIm downloading thousands of files every second. Each file is about 5KB and the total download speed is about 200Mbs. I need to save all of these files.p  pThe download process is split between thousands of different async tasks that are running. When they finish downloading a file and want to save it, they add it to a queue of files to save.p  pHere is what the class for this looks like. I create an instance of this class at very beginning, and have my tasks add files that need to be saved to the queue.p  precodePublic Class FileSaver  Structure FileToSave     Dim path As String     Dim data As Byte End Structure  Private FileQueue As New Concurrent.BlockingCollectionOf FileToSave  Sub New     Task.Run         Async Function              While 1                 Dim fl As FileToSave  FileQueue.Take                 Using sourceStream As New FileStreamfl.path, FileMode.Append, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None, bufferSize4096, useAsyncTrue                         Await sourceStream.WriteAsyncfl.data, 0, fl.data.Length                 End Using             End While          End Function      End Sub  Public Sub Addpath As String, data As Byte     Dim fl As FileToSave     fl.path  path     fl.data  data     FileQueue.Addfl End Sub  Public Function Count     Return FileQueue.Count End Function  End Class codepre  pThere is only emoneem instance of this class, there is only emoneem queue. Each task does emnotem create a separate queue. There is one global instance of this class with an internal queue, and all my tasks add the files to this single queue.p  pIve since replaced the codeConcurrentQueuecode with a default codeBlockingCollectioncode, which should work just like a codeConcurrentQueuecode, but allow me to have a blocking codeTakecode from the collection, without having to constantly loop.p  pThe hard disk Im using supports 180MBs maximum readwrite speeds. Im only downloading at 200Mbs, and I dont seem to be able to save the data fast enough as the queue keeps growing. Something is wrong, and i cant seem to figure out what.p  pIs this the best fastest way to do it Could I create any improvements herep  hr  pEDIT This question was put on hold, and i cant post my own answer with what i figured out. Ill post it here.p  pThe problem here is that while writing to a file is a relatively cheap process, opening a file for writing is not. Since I was downloading thousands of files, i was saving each one separately, which was significantly hurting performance.p  pWhat i did instead was group multiple downloaded files while they were still in RAM together into one file with delimiters, and write that file to disk. The files Im downloading have some properties that allow them to be logically grouped in this way, and still used later. The ratio is about 1001.p  pI no longer seem to be writebound, and Im currently saving at 40MBs, if i hit another premature limit, Ill update this. Hope this helps someone.p  hr  pEDIT2 More progress on my goal to faster IO.p  pSince Im now combining multiple files into one, this means that Im performing a total of 1 open CreateFile operation, and then multiple writes to an opened file. This is good, but still not optimal. It is better to do one 10MB write rather than ten 1MB writes. Multiple writes are slower, and cause disk fragmentation which later slows down reads as well. Not good.p  pSo the solution was to buffer all or as many as i can downloaded files in RAM, and then once Ive hit some point, write them all to the single file with one Write operation. I have 50GB of RAM, so this works great for me.p  pHowever, now there is another problem. Since Im now manually buffering my write data to do as few Write operations as possible, the Windows cache becomes somewhat redundant and actually starts slowing stuff down, and eating up RAM. Lets get rid of it.p  pThe solution to this is to do unbuffered and async IO, which is supported by Windows CreateFile. But not easily supported in .NET. I had to use a library the only one that seems to exist to accomplish this that you can find here a hrefhttpprogrammingaddicted.blogspot.com201105unbufferedoverlappedioinnet.html relnofollowhttpprogrammingaddicted.blogspot.com201105unbufferedoverlappedioinnet.htmlap  pThat allows for simple unbuffered asynchronous IO from .NET. The only requirement is that you now have to manually sectoralign your byte buffers otherwise WriteFile will fail with an Invalid Parameter error. In my case this just required aligning my buffers to a multiple of 512.p  pAfter all of this, i was able to hit 110MBs write speed to my drive. Much better than i expected.p

Negative 643 pI worked with Opscode Chef a couple of years ago, and Im thinking about using it again at my new company  but I am wondering if some of my issues with Chef have been addressed in the meantime or if I should expect to use the same workarounds.p  pWhile I loved many features of the Server flavor, I didnt like the fact that version management of our cookbooks and roles was separate from the actual adding of the items to the chef server.  In my mind, having those 2 different steps was just asking for trouble when someone created a run list from a file, and then neglected to commit those changes to version control. I eventually went with chefsolo, running on a cron job and pulling down changes from our repository, and then running from a shell script that pointed to our specific node.json configuration. This way, the only way to get items into Chef was by having them in Git. To be honest, this seems like the only sane way to go about things you dont use version control for your project but FTP your files to your production server.p  pDo the newer version of Chef have the capability to only read configuration updates from your version controlled repository If not, are there any tools that use commit hooks on the repository to update Chefs configuration Has anyone out there had a similar concern, and how did you address itp  pI am also open to using Puppet or any other pullbased tool, I just dont have any experience with it so its not my first choice. Ansible  any pushbased tool wont work. We are managing machines behind firewalls, sometimes with unpredictable network connections.p

Negative 643 pFor some reason when I connect my Windows laptop to the personal hot spot on my rooted Nexus 5 phone, a new wireless connection entry is created in Windows for the connection.

I have observed this issue in Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 on 2 different systems.p  pemEXAMPLEem WPA2 PSK hot spot named Nx5 laptop is set to connect automatically using DHCPp  ul lipThe 1st time I connect to the hot spot, a registry key is created in [HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionNetworkListProfiles] for the connection with the strongProfileNamestrong and strongDescriptionstrong set to NX5pli lipEach subsequent reboot  reconnect to the hot spot a new registry key is created for the connection with the strongProfileNamestrong and strongDescriptionstrong set to NX5  with  indicating the number of iterations the key was recreatedpli ul  pWhile this isnt a huge issue and doesnt prevent me from using the hot spot, after a few months, there are dozens of new registry keys that I end up having to manually clean up.p  pAny suggestions on how to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated as I would prefer not having to clean hundreds of these unused keys out of my registry every year.p

Negative 643 pI have been using Dropbox Core API in my iOS app for quite a while now. After updating to Xcode 7 I received the following error when I try to compile my projectp  precodeld ...FrameworksDropboxiOSDropboxSDK.frameworkDropboxSDK does not contain bitcode.  You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled Xcode setting ENABLEBITCODE, obtain an updated  library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target.  codepre  pI know what Bitcode is and what it is good for. The error can be solved by simply setting the codeEnable Bitcodecode option to codeNocode in the targets Build Settings. After this everything compiles without any error and the app runs without any problem.p  pSo far so good, but is this the right solution I checked the Dropbox page for an updated Version of the SDK, but I already use the latest version.p  pThe Project contains some other target for an App Widget, Watch Extension, etc. which do not use the Dropbox SDK. What option for codeEnable Bitcodecode should be used here Is is for some reason better use the same value codeNocodein my case for all targets Does it make any sense to enable Bitcode for Watch and Widget targets if the the main app target does not use Bitcodep  pWhat is the best practice herep

Negative 643 pI have a custom Devise create action that creates the User but also creates a bunch of other records in other models on User signup so that the User has some tools available the second they signup. I have this all working using the usual User signup form that Devise autogenerates and also an extra textfieldtag field which gives the name for a Group which is autocreated for the User on signup. First problem is I want to run all validations to ensure the Group and User fields are valid before any records get saved. Currently the User gets created and if that works the Group gets created along with the necessary joins. I need to ensure the Group name is valid before saving the User. Should I just include the Active Record validations module in the controller and use a beforeactionp  pAny pointers will be much appreciated.p
