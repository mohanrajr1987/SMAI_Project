Positive 7436 pSo in some method, I will be opening a new IO stream, doing some processing with it, and then using that stream as the input to open up another IO stream. I dont believe I can use a single trywithresources block because of the processing with the first IO stream being in between opening the first and second streams. So with that said, would it be better in a codingdesign sense to use a single trycatchfinally block to open and close these streams or use nested trywithresources blocks to open and close the streams I know that if there is no processing between the first and second IO streams, it would be best to open all three streams in a single trywithresources block.p  pA simplistic example followsp  pstrongTryCatchFinallystrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     SomeIOStream io1  null    SomeIOStream io2  null    SomeIOStream io3  null     try       io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing        io1.moreStreamProcessing       io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1        io3  new SomeIOStream is       do stuff with io2 and io3     catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing streams io3, io2, io1, is      codepre  pstrongTrywithresourcesstrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     try  SomeIOStream io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing         io1.moreStreamProcessing       try  SomeIOStream io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1              SomeIOStreeam io3  new SomeIOStream is              do stuff with io2 and io3            catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing stream is      codepre  pTo me, it looks as though the first is cleaner, but the second has the benefits of a trywithresources block.  Of course, stronganotherstrong alternative is to open the initial io1 with trywithresources, but open io2 and io3 within that tryblock. So would this third mixed approach be better than the above twop  pstrongMixed Approachstrongp  precodevoid someMethodInputStream is throws SomeException     SomeIOStream io1  null    SomeIOStream io2  null    SomeIOStream io3  null     try SomeIOStream io1  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessing         io1.moreStreamProcessing       io2  new SomeIOStream someSortOfProcessingio1        io3  new SomeIOStream is       do stuff with io2 and io3     catch Throwable t        Exception Handling     finally        closing streams io3, io2, is      codepre  pAlso as an additional question, am I right to assume that the only way to close the InputStream codeiscode would be to put it in the finallyblockp
Positive 7436 pI hate asking duplicate questions, but I have been researching and working on this program all day without much luck. Its supposed to take a temperature of water in Cel. or Far., and an altitude in Feet or Meters, and  tell you whether at the given altitude, the water is either in liquid, gas, or solid form not factoring in atmospheric pressure, I am just trying to get a rough estimate based on the altitude. The rules of thumb is that water will boil at 1 degree lower than 100 degrees C. for every 300 meters or 1000 feet above sealevel.p  pI managed to find a couple ways to make it return a roughly correct number. The next step is adding error checking to the program.

More complex contracts can be defined using Contract annotation, for example Contract, null gt null  method returns null if its second argument is null Contract, null gt null , null gt null  method returns null if its second argument is null and notnull otherwise Contracttrue gt fail  a typical assertFalse method which throws an exception if true is passed to it  The inspection can be configured to use custom Nullable NotNull annotations by default the ones from annotations.jar will be used codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strong As it turns out, the code analysis is wrong, the value is nonnull once run. Thank you everyone including commentators for sharing your insights and advice. Ultimately I inserted a logger.info with the value before the condition and everything seemed to work. The reason it seemed to stop working is because the graph server was running into timeouts.p

Positive 7436 pIm trying to read a bunch of csv files in SQL Server using SQL Bulk Insert and DataContext.ExecuteCommand. Maybe this isnt the best way to do it, but it does allow me stay in the Type Provider contextas opposed to with SqlBulkCopy I think. Now the upload is glitchy with intermittent success. Some files read in, some fail with Data conversion error truncation.

But when that fails, I want to try repeatedly again with other row terminators.

Positive 7436 pHi Im newbie in programming and I have this problem. I want to get input from user , using scanner. Program is supposed to try if input is valid, then call a function to do the job. Problem is I want program to repeat aking for input from user, if input is not valid. So I have try block in a while loop. The problem is on the first iteration of while loop everything is ok but when I insert invalid input and while loop is forced to iterate second time, try block is not executed and boolean which is condition of while loop is not set to false. So while loop runs for ever. Plz be kind.p  precodepublic static void mainString args[]      Scanner scanner  new ScannerSystem.in     boolean isRunning  true     int input      whileisRunning          System.out.printlninsert a number         try              input  scanner.nextInt             inputToStringinput             isRunning  false          catchInputMismatchException e              System.out.printlninput musi byt cele cislo             isRunning  true                  public static void inputToStringint input      System.out.printlninput   codepre

Negative 7436 pIve been pondering this question for a whilep  pCan you build a faster fundamental datastructure i.e. linked list, hashtable, set, skiplist, bloom filter, redblack tree, etc. on a multicore machine, by taking advantage of the fact that youve got more than one CPUp  pI did some preliminary experimenting with pthreads, and found that pthreadcreate takes on the order of 30us, but a simple hashmap insert takes far less time than that on a single core.  And thus, its become hard for me to imagine creating a faster hashmaplt, since synchronization primitives and thread creation are so slow.   I can also imagine tree traversal and balancing in parallel, but again, synchronization primitives would seem to make runtimes longer, not shorter.p  pIt still feels intuitive to me that Ive got more CPU, and thus, I should be able to do it faster, but I cant quite wrap my head around a proof or counterproof for that statement.   Ive experimented quite a bit in C, but am now suspecting that other languages may offer better solutions erlang for this task.  Thoughtsp  pEDIT details  I think there are several programming  datastructure paradigms that are frequently used that could possibly be sped up.  For example, I find myself frequently writing code that basically looks like this where real data has been replaced with rand p  precodestatic const int N  1000000  static const int M  10000000  10x more lookups  hashmapltint, intgt m   batch insert a bunch of interesting data  for int i  0 i lt N i m[rand]  rand    Do some random access lookups.  for int i  0 i lt M i m[rand] codepre  pThis kind of paradigm is frequently used for things like namevalue settings amp configuration data, batch processing, etc.   The 10x or more lookupinsert ratio is what makes a traditional hashmaplt ideal for this sort of operation. p  pThis could easily be split in half, with an insert phase and a lookup phase, and in a parallel world, there may be some flush queue operation between the two halves.   More difficult is the interleaved insert  lookup version p  precodehashmapltint, intgt m   for int i  0 i lt N i      if rand  LOOKUPRATIO  0       hashmap[rand]   lookup     else       hashmap[rand]  rand   insert   codepre  pIn that scenario, insert could be asynchronous as long as the insert queue were flushed before each lookup, and if LOOKUPRATIO is large enough say, 1000 then it becomes quite similar to the batch example above, but with some queueing.  Although, the queueing implies synchronization primitives. p  pImagine for a second, the following snippet p  precodehashmapltint,intgt a hashmapltint,intgt b  for int i  0 i lt N i      the following 2 lines could be executed in parallel    a[rand]  rand    b[rand]  rand   codepre  pAnd thus, a lookup might be done in parallel byp  precodeint lookupint value      The following 2 lines could be executed in parallel    v1  a[value]    v2  b[value]    if v1   pseudo code for value existed in a      return v1    else      return v2   codepre

Negative 7436 pI am wondering if there is a way to check a users permissions against an ACL in c.

Negative 7436 pAfter calling strongMKMapViewstrongs emsetCenterCoordinateanimatedem method without animation, Id like to call emselectAnnotationanimatedem with animation so that the annotation pops out from the newlycentered pushpin.p  pFor now, I simply watch for emmapViewDidFinishLoadingMapem and then select the annotation. However, this is problematic. For instance, this method isnt called when theres no need to load additional map data. In those cases, my annotation isnt selected. codecodep  pVery well. I could call this immediately after setting the center coordinate instead. Ahh, but in that case its possible that there emisem map data to load but it hasnt finished loading yet.

Negative 7436 pIm using Apples a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarysamplecodeMailComposerMailComposera example application to send email from within my application OS 3.0 functionality. Is it possible to set the To, Subject, or Body fields as first responder with MFMailComposeViewControllerp  pIn other words, the behavior would be the user presses a button which presents the mail view presentModalViewController. When the mail view is presented, the cursor is placed in one of the fields and the keyboard opens.p  pI notice the MFMailComposeViewController documentation saysp  piImportant The mail composition interface itself is not customizable and must not be modified by your application. In addition, after presenting the interface, your application is not allowed to make further changes to the email content. The user may still edit the content using the interface, but programmatic changes are ignored. Thus, you must set the values of content fields before presenting the interface.ip  pHowever, I dont care about customizing the interface. I just want to set that firstResponder. Any ideasp

Negative 7436 pWith the wide variety of web development frameworks that are available, there always seems to be a perpetual incentive to try something new.  Hence, some of us find ourselves trading one framework for another, never being ementirelyem satisfied with the end results.  Granted there will always be niches where a given web framework will serve perfectly.  But, there are many who have settled on using C, Java or C for building, say, desktop applications.  The same isnt quite true when it comes to web development applications.  Joel Spolsky touches on this in a hrefhttpwww.joelonsoftware.comitems20070918.html relnofollowlink texta.p  pLets say if I were to build such a framework what would the functional requirements be  The goal here is to list strongconcretestrong functional expectations defined succinctly for the sake of a stackoverflow posting, of course.

Negative 7436 pIm drawing a design for a system to do daily business functions for my company.  It will consist of a Oracle 10g database with PlSQL packages and a Javabased web application.  All of this is running on a Solaris 10 server.  Aside from handling transactions from the web interface, scheduled tasks need to run on the database to run calculations and load data etc.p  pThis is a redesign of a legacy system that currently controls everything with a plethora of cron jobs. Given the task of redesigning it, would you do it differently  I know Oracle has its own task scheduler, but the DBA argues that he would rethink using it because if the database is down or offline for some reason, it cant send alerts or log errors of any kind. The cron jobs currently have the ability to send SMS messages or emails should one of the tasks fail. Another option would be to have the web application do it somehow.p  pWhat do you suggestp

Negative 7436 pIm implementing a custom container with an STLlike interface.  I have to provide a regular iterator and a const iterator.  Most of the code for the two versions of the iterators is identical .  How can I avoid this duplicationp  pFor example, my container class is codeFoocode, and Im implementating codeFooIteratorcode and codeFooConstIteratorcode.  Both of the iterators have to provide methods like codeoperatorcode which are identical.p  pMy question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions123758howdoiremovecodeduplicationbetweensimilarconstandnonconstmemberfunctHow do I remove code duplication between similar const and nonconst member functionsa, but the answer to that one is specific to const and nonconst methods, especially accessors.  I dont see how that might generalize to the iterator problem.p  pShould I have codeFooIteratorcode derive from codeFooConstIteratorcode and extend it with additional nonconst methods  That either leads to virtual methods or method hiding, which seem inappropriate here.p  pPerhaps codeFooIteratorcode should contain a codeFooConstIteratorcode.  Although that approach does reduce implementation duplication, it seems to reintroduce a lot of boilerplate method definitions.p  pIs there clever template technique for generating the two iterators from a single definition  Or perhaps theres a way toshudderuse the preprocessor to stamp out these nearly identical classes.p  pIve tried looking at my local STL implementation to see how it handle this.  There are so many helper classes that Im having trouble grokking the design, but it looks like the functionality is simply duplicated.p  pIn previous projects, my custom container was built on top of a standard STL container, so I didnt have to provide my own iterators.  Thats not an option in this case.p

Negative 7436 pI have read and generally agree that to increase code legibility, you should use constants instead of magic numbers as method parameters. For example, using PHPp  precode no constants  function updateRecordid      if id  1           update all records      else           update record with id  id        updateRecord1  future maintainer says wtf does 1 do                    and then has to jump to the function definition   with constants   defineUPDATEALL, 1  function updateRecordid      if id  UPDATEALL           update all records      else           update record with id  id        updateRecordUPDATEALL  future maintainer says woot codepre  psubemYeah, its not a great example, I know...emsubp  pSo, I can see how this is a Better Thing, but it raises the question of how often you should do this If it is for every function, youd end up with a metric shirtload of constant definitions.p  pstrongWhere would you draw the linestrong Stick with constants over magic numbers all the way, or take a blended approach depending on the usage of the function in questionp

Negative 7436 pIm building a winforms app utilizing passiveview MVP and Castle Windsor as an IoC container.  Im still a little new to dependency injection and MVP, so Im looking for some clarity...p  pI have a main form which contains a number of user controls, and also will bring up other dialogs ex. Login, options, etc as needed.  My first question is...should I use constructor injection to get the presenters for these other views into the main view, or should I go back to a Service Locatortype pattern which Ive been told is a big nono  Or something elsep  pSecond question...the user controls need to communicate back to the main form when they are completed definition of that state varies based on the control.  Is there a standard way of hooking these up  I was thinking perhaps just wiring up events between the main presenter and the child presenters, but Im not sure if this is proper thinking.p  pId appreciate any help, it seems that the combination of MVP and IoC in winforms isnt exactly welldocumented.p

Negative 7436 pI have a knowngood Dictionary, and at run time I need to create a new Dictionary and run a check to see if it has the same keyvalue pairs as the knowngood Dictionary potentially inserted in different orders, and take one path if it does and another if it doesnt. I dont necessarily need to serialize the entire knowngood Dictionary I could use a hash, for example, but I need some ondisk data that has enough information about the knowngood Dictionary to allow for comparison, if not for recreation. What is the quickest way to do this I can use a SortedDictionary, but the amount of time required to initialize and add values counts in the speed of this task.p  pConcrete examplep  pConsider a DictionarycodeltString,ListltStringgtgtcode that looks something like this in no particular order, obviously  p  precode key1, value1, value2 , key2, value3, value4     codepre  pI create that Dictionary once and save some form of information about it on disk a full serialization, a hash, whatever. Then, at runtime, I do the followingp  precodeDictionaryltString,ListltStringgtgt d1  new DictionaryltString,ListltStringgtgt  DictionaryltString,ListltStringgtgt d2  new DictionaryltString,ListltStringgtgt  DictionaryltString,ListltStringgtgt d3  new DictionaryltString,ListltStringgtgt   String key11  key1 String key12  key1 String key13  key1 String key21  key2 String key22  key2 String key23  key2  ListltStringgt value11  new ListltStringgt value1, value2 ListltStringgt value12  new ListltStringgt value1, value2 ListltStringgt value13  new ListltStringgt value1, value2 ListltStringgt value21  new ListltStringgt value3, value4 ListltStringgt value22  new ListltStringgt value3, value4 ListltStringgt value23  new ListltStringgt value3, value5  dict1.addkey11, value11 dict1.addkey21, value21 dict2.addkey22, value22 dict2.addkey12, value12 dict3.addkey13, value13 dict3.addkey23, value23  dict1.comparefileName Should return true dict2.comparefileName Should return true dict3.comparefileName Should return false codepre  pAgain, if the overall time from startup to the return from compare is quicker, I can change this code to use a SortedDictionary or anything else instead, but I cant guarantee ordering and I need some consistent comparison. compare could load a serialization and iterate through the dictionaries, it could serialize the inmemory dictionary and compare the serialization to the file name, or it could do any number of other things.p

In that time, all bootstrapping was happening, but I would have thought by using our chain of repositories where the central repository is well filled, the build would be much faster.

So configuration and interaction of Maven and Artifactory is under consideration.p  pHow do you debug such an environment I have access to the build machine as sudo and to the central repository, but I do not know how to start, what to prove, where to look.

Negative 7436 pHow to ensure that the exception thrown by Asynchronous method from EJB 3.1 methods are not silently eaten up by Future  br I know one can use Future.get method to retrieve exception but it will wait till the computation is done, a problem in case no exception occur and you have to wait till the computation is over.p  pUpdatep  pThe scenario is fairly simple. A stateless EJB exposes its method with Asynchronous annotation, primarily intended for Local. The AS is JBoss. During computation, its possible that a RuntimeException occurs. Clients may or may not want to poll if the job is finished, but in all cases they should know if exception has occurred.

Negative 7436 pJava has several XML binding frameworks that map Java objects into XML and back. These frameworks allows one to map various Java hierarchies and classes into the chosen XML structure. They can be configured through a separate configuration file. These frameworks include Castor, JiBX and the like.

Most do not extend the flexibility of mapping complex Java hierarchies into any arbitrary chosen JSON object representation. The configuration is usually pretty limited.p  pIm currently trying to build a web service that returns json responses.

Negative 7436 pAs has a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7809598ios5uiscrollviewandlayoutsubviewsbehaviourbeen reporteda in other questions here on SO, iOS 5 changes how rotation callbacks for split view controllers are sent as per this release note.  This is not a dupe I think, as I cant find another question on SO that deals with how to adjust split view controller usage in iOS 5 to cope with the changep  blockquote   pRotation callbacks in iOS 5 are not applied to view controllers that   are presented over a full screen. What this means is that if your code   presents a view controller over another view controller, and then the   user subsequently rotates the device to a different orientation, upon   dismissal, the underlying controller i.e. presenting controller will   not receive any rotation callbacks. Note however that the presenting   controller will receive a viewWillLayoutSubviews call when it is   redisplayed, and the interfaceOrientation property can be queried from   this method and used to lay out the controller correctly.p blockquote  pIm having trouble configuring the popover button in my root split view controller the one that is supposed to show the left pane view in a popover when youre in portrait.  Heres how my app startup sequence used to work in iOS 4.x when the device is in landscape modep  ol lipInstall split view controller into window with code[window addSubviewsplitViewController.view] [window makeKeyAndVisible]code.  This results in codesplitViewControllerwillHideViewControllerwithBarButtonItemforPopoverControllercode being called on the delegate i.e. simulating a landscape  portrait rotation even though the device is already in landscape mode.pli lipPresent a fullscreen modal my loading screen which completely covers the split view underneath.pli lipFinish loading and dismiss the loading screen modal.  Since the device is in landscape mode, as the split view controller is revealed, this causes codesplitViewControllerwillShowViewControllerinvalidatingBarButtonItemcode to be called on the delegate i.e. simulating a portrait  landscape rotation, thereby invalidating the bar button item, removing it from the rightside of the split view, and leaving us where we want to be.  Hooraypli ol  pSo, the problem is that because of the change described in that release note, whatever happens internally in iOS 4.3 that results in codesplitViewControllerwillShowViewControllerinvalidatingBarButtonItemcode being called no longer happens in iOS 5.  I tried subclassing UISplitViewController so I could provide a custom implementation of codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode as suggested by the release note, but I dont know how to reproduce the desired sequence of internal events that iOS 4 triggers.  I tried thisp  precode void viewWillLayoutSubviews      [super viewWillLayoutSubviews]      UINavigationController rightStack  [[self viewControllers] objectAtIndex1]     UIViewController rightRoot  [[rightStack viewControllers] objectAtIndex0]     BOOL rightRootHasButton  ...  determine if bar button item for portrait mode is there       iOS 4 never goes inside this if branch     if UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape [self interfaceOrientation]  ampamp         rightRootHasButton               Manually invoke the delegate method to hide the popover bar button item         [self.delegate splitViewControllerself                     willShowViewController[[self viewControllers] objectAtIndex0]                  invalidatingBarButtonItemrightRoot.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem]       codepre  pThis mostly works, but not 100.  The problem is that invoking the delegate method yourself doesnt emactuallyem invalidate the bar button item, so the first time you rotate to portrait, the system thinks the bar button item is still installed properly and doesnt try to reinstall it.  Its only after you rotate again to landscape and then back to portrait has the system got back into the right state and will actually install the popover bar button item in portrait mode.p  pBased on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4655302whydoesntiosautorotateaviewloadedfromanibafteritwasreleasedbydid46655314665531this questiona, I also tried invoking all the rotation callbacks manually instead of firing the delegate method, e.g.p  precode iOS 4 never goes inside this if branch if UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape [self interfaceOrientation]  ampamp     rightRootHasButton      [self willRotateToInterfaceOrientationself.interfaceOrientation duration0]     [self willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientationself.interfaceOrientation duration0]     [self didRotateFromInterfaceOrientationself.interfaceOrientation]  codepre  pHowever this just seems to cause an infinite loop back into codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode p  pDoes anyone know what the correct way to simulate the iOS4style rotation events is for a split view controller that appears from behind a fullscreen modal  Or should you not simulate them at all and is there another bestpractices approach that has become the standard for iOS5p  pAny help really appreciated as this issue is holding us up from submitting our iOS5 bugfix release to the App Store.p

Negative 7436 pSo I am working on a GUI that involves working with tables that can be sorted. I am noticing that when I sort a table, and I select a row from the newly sorted table, the selected row index of that row points to the data row from before the sort. I understand that this is because the view has changed, but the model has not thus, you have the need for convertRowIndexToModel. It is also to my understanding that one can automatically update the view based on changes to the model by firing TableModelEvents.p  pSo here is my question is it possible to automatically update the TableModel, based on changes to the view, so that I would not have to worry about converting the view index to table indexp

Negative 7436 pProgramming in C, are there any techniques one can use to avoid or at least minimize the likelihood of casting a void  to the wrong pointer type by mistake  Im working on a program that parses several different types of CSV datafiles and stores the fields into specific data structures for processing.  For example, the records of one of the data files is stored in a hash table data from another file is stored in a directed graph.p  pId like to create one main parsing function that reads in a record of fields from the file and passes each record to a function that tokenizes the fields and stores them in the appropriate data type.  Instead of creating separate parsingtokenizing functions for each filetype, I wanted to create a generic function to do this.  In my design, the calling function would pass a record of fields, a function pointer to the tokenizer applicable to the datafile, and a void pointing to a node of the destination data structure applicable to the datafile.p  pWhat I want to know is whether there is any way to ensure that the user does not mistakenly call the parsing function with a mismatched tokenizer  data structure.  By using the pointer to void, the compiler is certainly helpless here.  Or, if there are no such techniques, are there any effective exceptionhandling methods to catch this error and prevent major problems e.g., sigfaults p  pId like the code to be as portable as possible.p  pAny thoughts  Im not married to this algorithm, if someone has a better idea Im open to it.p

Negative 7436 pAssuming a JavaScriptbased singlepage application is returned by the server on the initial request. Besides some initialization code, which is common for every application, just the portion of the application needed to show the requested page e.g. index page is returned by the server on the initial request then cached and rendered.p  pAs the user clicks through the application, other portions of the application should be asynchronously loaded fetched, requested or however you wanna call it from the server. By portions a mean javascript code, images, css, etc. required to render the page. Lets focus on the javascript code part in this discussion.p  pIts important to notice that the javascript code to be returned to the browser is not contained in separate static files which would be easy then and might be the case in the future due to e.g. performance reasons, but rather in one file, so its not a 11 assiociation request  file.p  pE.g. we could have a single app defined like thisp  precodevar LayoutPresenter  App.Presenter.extendLayoutPresenter,    view ltdivgtlink Author author  link Book bookltdivgt   var AuthorPresenter  App.Presenter.extendAuthorPresenter,    view ltdivgtlth1gtnamelth1gtltdivgt,   parent LayoutPresenter,   context  name Steve    var BookPresenter  App.Presenter.extendBookPresenter,    view ltdivgtlth1gttitlelth1gtltdivgt,   parent LayoutPresenter,   context  title Advanced JavaScript   codepre  pemApp.Presenterem is part of the library I am writing and is available in the browser or on any other client. p  pSo assuming the user is browsing to the emBookem page which hasnt be loaded before neither initially nor cached in the browser, the emBookPresenterem code, which is a function, should be returned by the server assuming the emLayoutPresenterem code is already available in the browser and emApp.Presenterem is available anyway because its part of the library. I am running node.js on the server side.p  pHow would you recommend to address this problemp  pThere is the emevalem function, so one could send javascript as a string and bring it back to live using eval, but such an approach seems to be bad practice.p

Negative 7436 pThis is what Im trying to achieve I want to extend the HandleErrorAttribute so I can redirect to an appropriate error page. I had a look at the implementation of HandleErrorAttribute and noticed that essentially it just returns a ViewResult, that points to a view, that can be defined per Exception type.p  pId like to use the same system as HandleErrorAttribute, exceptp  ol liId like to define a Controller for Error pagesli liI want to maintain the Exception as model HandleErrorInfoli ol  pI could obviously use a RedirectToRouteResult, but I cant pass through the Exception as model, since its an actual Response.Redirect. And Id like to avoid having to cache the model server side.p  pFor now Im just overwriting the ViewResult and manually setting controller.

Negative 7436 pHi im new to programming but am currently working on a session timeout problem.  Basically my session keeps timing out even though ive changed the session.gcmaxlifetime.  I think another script using the same directory to store session data which doesnt have the maxlifetime set, is running and thus itll use the shorter value instead. TO combat this ive altered the htaccess file but it is still terminating after an 1hr 30mins, i need it to last for longer.  My htaccess file is below.  Ive looked at and tried many of the relevant posts on this board but nothing has worked so far.

I am interested in understanding the classloading behavior.p  pDiscarding caching, etc., first the codeLoggercode class attempts to use the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangThread.htmlgetContextClassLoader2829 relnofollowcontext classloadera this is good and what Id expect.p  pIf that classloader cannot load a codeResourceBundlecode using the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilResourceBundle.htmlgetBundle28java.lang.String,20java.util.Locale,20java.lang.ClassLoader29 relnofollowcodeResourceBundlegetBundleString, Locale, ClassLoadercode calla , then the system classloader is used next.  That was slightly puzzling to me Id assume that the callers classloader would be the next one in line.  Is this an optimization, or is this to handle some specific use case, or...p  pFinally, if the system classloader cannot load the codeResourceBundlecode, then the inferred call stack  is walked, and each class in that stack is mined for emitsem classloader, and each of those is tried in turn.p  pFor all the various classloading scenarios Ive encountered or had to write, this one makes the least sense to me.  I suspect this has to do with codeLoggercodes potential centrality to any given system, but I would welcome any explanation as to why this particular algorithm was selected.p  pAlso, side question not really worthy of its own entry is there any circumstance in the JVM where the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangThread.htmlgetContextClassLoader2829 relnofollowcontext classloadera is codenullcodep

Negative 7436 pI know this question has been asked many times, but Ive read the answers to many of the questions and still cannot understand why I am receiving this errorp  blockquote   pFatal error Uncaught exception PDOException with message   SQLSTATE[HY000] General error 2014 Cannot execute queries while   other unbuffered queries are active. Consider using   PDOStatementfetchAll. Alternatively, if your code is only ever   going to run against mysql, you may enable query buffering by setting   the PDOMYSQLATTRUSEBUFFEREDQUERY attribute.p blockquote  pThe first thing that is odd, is that I do not get an error on my localhost wampserver, but I do get it on my web server. The php version on my localhost is 5.3.10, and on my web server it is 5.3.13.p  pI have read that the source of this error is making a query when data left in the buffer from a previous query. This is not the case for me  I have echod out all of the data and I know for a fact that every row returned in a query is being fetched. p  pWith that said, I have found that changing one of my queries to codefetchAllcode instead of codefetchcode fixes the problem, but it simply makes no since because I strongknowstrong that all of the rows returned are being read. When I used codefetchAllcode for the query it is being made in a loop, I printed out the array each loop, and only one item was in the array for each query in the loop.p  pOne more piece of information. Its not the query that I changed to codefetchAllcode which makes the error go away that throws the PDO error, there is another query later in my php file that throws the error. My file is basically like thisp  precode... code ...  query 1  ... code ...  loop query 2 end loop  ... code ...   query 3 codepre  pIf I comment out query 3, there is no error. If I comment out, or change to codefetchAllcode, query 2, there is no error. query 1 has no affect whatsoever.p  pI would also like to add that I have tried adding codeLIMIT 1code to emallem of the queries on the page at the same time, and the error is still there. I think this proves there is not unread data in the buffer, rightp  pIm really confused, so I would appreciate your advice.

Negative 7436 pHow should I name my Haskell modules emfor a program, not a libraryem, and strongorganize them in a hierarchystrongp  pIm making a ray tracer called Luminosity. First I had these modulesp  precodeVector Colour Intersect Trace Render Parse Export codepre  pEach module was fine on its own, but I felt like this lacked organization.p  pFirst of all I put every module under  codeLuminositycode, so for example codeVectorcode was now codeLuminosity.Vectorcode I assume this is standard for a haskell program.p  pThen I thought, Vector and Colour are pretty much independent and could be reused, so they should be separated. But theyre way to small to separate off into a library 125 and 42 lines respectively.p  pWhere should they go There is already on hackage a codeData.Vectorcode and codeData.Colourcode, so should I put them there Or will that cause confusion even if I import them grouped with my other local imports If not  there, should it be codeLuminosity.Data.Vectorcode or codeData.Luminosity.Vectorcode Im pretty sure Ive seen both used, although maybe I just happened to look at a project using a nonconventional structure.p  pI also have a simple TGA image exporter codeExportcode which can be independent from Luminosity. It appears the correct location would be codeCodec.Image.TGAcode, but again, should codeLuminositycode be in there somewhere and if so wherep  pFinally I have codeParsecode which contains codeJSONcode instances for pretty much everything. codeghc Wallcode calls these orphans but I think it makes a lot more sense to keep them all together since they are all similar and need the same convenience functions. codeText.JSON.Instancescode would make sense, except this one is not independent, obviously, and so it emneedsem so have codeLuminositycode in there somewhere.p  pIt would be nice if a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiStructureofaHaskellprojectStructure of a Haskell projecta or some other wiki explained this.p

Negative 7436 pIm trying to do some tests with Dynamic Linq at the moment, but being new at it, I am having troubles.p  pCurrently I have one DataTable object that I have filled by an SQL query to a database. Now I want to execute dynamic linq queries on this DataTable. This may seem illogical, but my end goal is be able to perform joins on two different DataTables that are filled by two different databases, so with that in mind I hope it makes more sense. Im trying to understand a simpler situation and experiment a bit with it before I go on to solve that main problem.p  pQuestion one is that I am not entirely sure about the choice between IQueryableOf T and IEnumerableOf T. The way I understand is that if you do everything inmemory you choose IEnumerable. I would think that fits for my case then, right However, when I looked at changing the IEnumerable in IQuerbyable in the code snippet below, I was surprised to see that x.ItemFieldname does not work What am I missing  The error it gave is Late Binding operations cannot be converted to an Expression Tree.p  pAnyway, lets take a look. I already got part of it workingp  precode    Dim desc As String  Description     Dim status As String  Status      Dim query As IEnumerableOf DataRow  From x In tab.AsEnumerable     query  query.WhereFunctionx As Object x.Itemstatus lt 100      For Each row As DataRow In query.ToList     Do something     Next row codepre  pThis seems to work fine. I used the two string variables, because in the end I want to dynamically decide which field to take. So, xDescription is not the way to go for me. However, now I wanted to add a projection to the query, i.e. Select a number of columns.My expectation was that this should work like thisp  precodequery  query.SelectOf StringFunctionx As Object x.Itemdesc codepre  pN.B. I use SelectOf String, because this specific column has that as type. This should of course in the end be dynamically filled toop  pHowever, this fails during runtime on an InvalidCastException Unable to cast object of type WhereSelectEnumerableIteratorcode2[System.Data.DataRow,System.String] to type System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerablecode1[System.Data.DataRow]. I dont really understand what happens here Im guessing something is wrong because I want to return DataRows, but at the moment only select one field, which happens to be a String.  Can anyone explainhelp mep  pThanks in advancep  pOK, EDIT, as I should probably have given some more info from scratch  I could have a variable number of where or selectclauses. My idea was I could add these dynamically by looping through the list that contains this information. So I thought I kinda need the .Where and .Select functions that IEnumerable offers.p
Negative 7436 pIve started work on a pre existing REST application and am having trouble understanding how one would go about making a RESTful  clientp  pThe page on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRepresentationalstatetransferGuidingprinciplesoftheinterface relnofollowwikipediaa states the following p  pClients make state transitions only through actions that are dynamically identified within hypermedia by the server e.g. by hyperlinks  within hypertext. Except for simple fixed entry points to the application, a client does not assume that any particular actions will be available for any particular resources beyond those described in representations previously received from the server.p  pIf all the client can assume is a starting url then apart from a pure HTTP rest service running in a browser how would it be possible for the client to know how to display any information returned.p  pFor example a javaflash client would have to make an assumption about what data is returned in order to know how to display it, ad then of course the implementation would cease to be restfulp  pThanks for any insight.p  pPiersp

Negative 7436 pI am working on a Huffman Tree based off of a frequency table. The frequency table is generated from counting the frequency of characters in a given string and placing the respective item character and frequency in a LinkedList. I then need to place the items in a Huffman Tree in order of their frequency. I get that the logic behind it is to make sure there are right and left nodes to each subtree, add their frequencies, create a root node with their added frequencies, place the next frequencies in the left and right trees respectively and repeat this process until there are no more frequencies and the subtrees are connected with a root that adds their frequencies the trouble I am having is figuring out how to implement the code. p  pThe code is rather extensive so I would rather avoid posting all of it, the general layout is that I have a HuffmanFrequencyTable class that allows me to build the table, a HuffmanTreeNode class that allows us to create nodes to place in the tree, and a HuffmanTree class that helps us create the actual tree. An encode class then inputs a string and builds the tree from the string using the HuffmanFrequencyTable it creates. This is a homework problem so please do not provide solutions, I am just hoping for some help in figuring out the logic in the code of it.p  pRight now, I am creating an array of characters that have been placed in the tree, finding the lowest frequency among characters remaining in the table that arent in the array, and attempting to place them in leafs. When the base leafs are full in the subtrees I am trying to add those values, create a node, and continue up the tree. I am using a for loop for this. Does this seem like the right startp

This is a my mistake  I placed SVN repository root under DocumentRoot folder, so apache and webdav cant understand, who must handle request. This applies to TortoiseSVN client at least.p  pComments from SVN developersp  pIt means your httpd.conf is misconfigured. Usually this error happens when youve defined the Subversion virtual location to exist within two different scopes at the same time.p  pFor example, if youve exported a repository as , but youve also set your DocumentRoot to be www, then youre in trouble. When the request comes in for wwwfoobar, apache doesnt know whether to find a real file named foobar within your DocumentRoot, or whether to ask moddavsvn to fetch a file bar from the wwwfoo repository. Usually the former case wins, and hence the Moved Permanently error.p  pThe solution is to make sure your repository  does not overlap or live within any areas already exported as normal web shares.p  pIts also possible that you have an object in the web root which has the same name as your repository URL. For example, imagine your web servers document root is varwww and your Subversion repository is located at homesvnrepo. You then configure Apache to serve the repository at a hrefhttplocal.hostmyrepo relnofollowhttplocal.hostmyrepoa. If you then create the directory varwwwmyrepo this will cause a 301 error to occur.p

Negative 7436 pI am making a kind of CMS system that works in sections of the webpage, and stores each one as a different entry into a table on a database with MySQL. When the user first sets up the page, the PHP script calls a function called codeaddsectionname, contentcode that adds the section to the database. However, to make this system more flexible, so it doesnt use static sections, I would like to be able to change the function to be codeaddsectionname, functioncode, where you give a function for the parameter codefunctioncode. Is there any way that I could store this function or function name in the database and then call it when the code needs to get the section text And if not, what would I be able to do instead The function that I use to get the content of the section is simply codesectionnamecode.br Also, does anybody know an easy way to redirect to another page if the current page has not been viewed before that doesnt use files or anythingp

Negative 7436 pI am trying to fix a search tool for work. This is the first time I have encountered ASP.NET. The current search tool has a radio Button list with three options of how to search our local directory. However the person that worked on this project before me did not finish the code and has since quit. The radio buttons as they are not do not affect the search query as I have noticed that no matter what option you pick the query is the same.p  pThis is my attempt to rewrite the search function to incorporate the three radio button options. However when I incorporate this function into the rest of the code the page does not render at all and I am not getting the error. I dont think I made an error in the query strings because I took the original one and made variations of it by omitting Contains statements.

Negative 7436 pIm developing an app that uses wifi to broadcast UDP messages between all the mobiles that are in the same network that have my app.p  pI managed to sendreceive packets from many cellphones having an external AP, thats my router.p  pBut given the case that theres no AP, I want users to be able to use their phones Wifi Hotspot feature so they can still use my aplication. So one of the cellphones would be the wifi hotspot, and all the others would connect to that.p  pI require users to connect to a wifi by they own. Either to an external AP or to the said hotspot. Then when my application starts, it checks whether the phone is connected to a wifi network, calling the WifiManager.isWifiEnabled and NetworkInfo.isConnected.p  pThe problem is that if I call these functions in the cellphone thats using hotspot, the function isConnected will return false. And I cant get the broadcast address using WifiManager.getDhcpInfo. The other phones that are connected to the hotspot they do work perfectly. But the hotspot cellphone cant send any broadcast, since WifiManager is disabled.p  pSo, my question would be Is there any way to check if a cellphone is currently being a wifi hotspot And if so, is there any way I can get its broadcast addressp

Negative 7436 pHello there and warning for wall of text p  pI am about to build a site that scrape and collects instagram photos belonging to five combos of two hashtags. The first hashtag will be the same and are the name of the sitecampaign, the other hashtag till be one of five topics.p  pThis also need to sort under the instagram username so that each user can collect images of all five topics.p  pThis then needs to be presented as a toplist sorted by number of images DESC, combined likes DESC.

Just looping trough all cached images with cron and then doing an api request to update each like count seems a bit heavy both for my server and instagrams api limit.p  pMaybe i can utilize logged in users sessionstokens to do this in some smart wayp  pOr should i convince the rest of the team that this is a bad idea and we should build or own voting mechanism and keep the competition local, separated from instagrams like countersp  pPlease share your ideas of how youd store and solve this p

Negative 7436 pI am new to Visual Basic. I have installed Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. Created a new Windows Form Application. As an example, I made a simple program which will ask the end user to input 2 numbers and allow them to either add them or subtract the second number from the first one and display the output in a Textbox.p  pNow, I added another Subroutine which would be executed automatically when the Windows Form loads. This would calculate the width of the output Textbox and the Form Width and display at the bottom.p  pThis is how the code looks like right nowp  precodePublic Class Form1       Run this Subroutine initially to display the Form and Text box width     Private Sub FormLoad         Label5.Text  TextBox3.Width         Label7.Text  Me.Width     End Sub      Private Sub Button1ClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Button1.Click         Dim a As Integer         Dim b As Integer         a  TextBox1.Text         b  TextBox2.Text         TextBox3.Text  a  b     End Sub      Private Sub Button2ClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Button2.Click         Dim a As Integer         Dim b As Integer         a  TextBox1.Text         b  TextBox2.Text         TextBox3.Text  a  b     End Sub End Class codepre  pWhile everything works correctly for the addition and subtraction, it does not display the Form and output Textbox width in the Windows Form.p  pI think, FormLoad is not executing properly.p  pI also tried, FormActivate but that did not work either.p  pOnce I am able to do this, I would like to extend this concept to resize the output Textbox along with the Form resize.

Negative 7436 pI am doing some research to see whether I can automaticallyprogramatically validate a distribution.dist file that came from a valid os x pkgdmg.p  pHere is the situation I have some valid os x applications in dmg and pkg format. I have extracted their distribution.dist files and would like to determine which machines lets assume there are many these packages would install successfully on. I dont want to copy the entire pkgdmg files to every machine and then run the installer command to see if the installation would succeed or fail. This would consume excessive bandwidthresources. Instead, I would like to do something more lightweight like use a scriptcommandbinary that could evaluate only the distribution.dist requirements on the machine and then return if they are met or not.p  pI figure the hardest part of solving this problem would be how the Installer Javascript scripts would be executedevaluated. Since I do not see that Apple has given external access to those particular libraries. p  pOne idea I have is to use pkgbuild and create pkg files with no payload. Then I could use the usrsbininstaller command to install these empty pkgs. The install checks would be performed and the file size would be small. However, I am hoping there is a more elegant way of solving this problem.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7436 pIve encountered this problem in a couple rails apps, and I havent been able to figure out what the common thread is or find any discussion of this specific problem.p  pHeres what happens guard does not run specs when files are changed. BUT, if I hit enter at its prompt, causing it to run all specs, it will immediately afterwards run specs for all changed files. It seems to be detecting the changes, as it should, but not acting on them until after I make it do something. This makes guard fairly useless to me.p  pThe obvious answer is to try different things for monitoring file changes. Ive read advice to try updating or downgrading the codelistencode gem, for example. Ive also tried running bundle exec guard with codeforcepollingcode and it behaves the same way. These havent made a difference in this app. And heres the weird thing I have a related rails app on the same computer, using the same versions of all the related gems, and an identical Guardfile, which works correctly a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymous5659270 relnofollowHerea is that Guardfile barely modified from some template, for reference.p  pIm on OS X 10.8.3. The apps in question are currently using Rails 3.2.6, guard 1.2.1, rspec 2.12.0, and listen 0.6.0.p
Negative 7436 pAccess 2010 I have a table that includes 3 Boolean fields  call them FieldA, FieldB, and FieldC.  p  pOn the data entry form, a user should be able to check make the value TRUE any one of those options, but only one option can be TRUE at any time.  If FieldB is already true and the user wants to change it so FieldC is the option selected to be TRUE, he should first have to unselect FieldB reset it to FALSE before he can check the box on the form for FieldC.p  pSo I need some validation code for each of these fields which, if the user tries to set one field to TRUE, checks the status of the other two fields.  If both other fields are currently FALSE, it allows the current field to be changed to TRUE.  But if either of the other fields is currently TRUE, it should create a popup message saying theres already another selection and the other field must first be changed to FALSE before he can proceed.p  pI tried this using the numerical values for the YesNo option, setting a conditional validation that required the sum of the other two values to be zero before allowing the field of interest e.g. FieldA to be changed to TRUE value  1 just something like code[FieldB]  [FieldC] 0code, but I kept getting syntax errors. Im new enough to this that I dont know if it really is just a simple syntax problem, or if a completely different approach is needed.p  pLast piece of info its acceptable to have all 3 fields set to FALSE, so I dont want something that forces one of them to become TRUE if another is changed back from TRUE to FALSE.p

I added the codestdgnu0xcode compiler option according to the compiler warning recieved when first trying to compile but this doesnt seem to fix the issue.  Is this an issue of the system not recognizing and adding paths to experimental headers  Are there additional include paths or compiler options that I need to specifyp  pAs an additional note, I noticed in EclipseCDT that under the includes tab in the Project Explorer view, it shows a list of the system header patht.  It lists many header files under the userincludec4.4.4 path tab, but It doesnt list the regex header.  I think this is also reaffirming that there is a setting issue.p

Negative 7436 pI am developing a Dynamic web project Java EE using JSF, PrimeFaces, JPA, and running on Tomcat 7.

In Listing 332, you   see the persistence.xml file from Listing 211 converted for   deployment as part of a Java EE application. Instead of JDBC   properties for creating a connection, we now declare that the entity   manager should use the data source name jdbcEmployeeDS. If the data   source was defined to be available in the application namespace   instead of the local component naming context then we might instead   use the data source name of javaappjdbcEmployeeDS. The   transaction type attribute has also been removed to allow the   persistence unit to default to JTA. The application server will   automatically find entity classes, so even the list of classes has   been removed. This example represents the ideal minimum Java EE   configuration. Because the business logic that uses this persistence   unit is implemented in a stateless session bean, the persistence.xml   file would typically be located in the METAINF directory of the   corresponding EJB JAR.p blockquote  pstrongListing 332.

Negative 7436 pFirst of all I hope its not a problem I started a new topic. Tbh I dont have a clue how to ask a question based on an already answered one, so I made this.p  pIm pretty new with Java and my problem is the following. Im writing a little chat program and Im using a codeJEditorPanecode with an codeHTMLEditorKitcode to display text in different colors, to display smileys, and display hyperlinks.p  pMy problem is, and after some research I found out the problem might be due to Java7, I cant get the linewrap working properly. I want the text to word wrap and to wrap in the middle of Strings exceeding the width of the component. The word wrap works fine, but if someone types in a pretty long string the codeJEditorPanecode gets expanded and you need to resize the frame to get everything on screen, which is what I do not want to happen.p  pIve tried a few fixes for this problem, but they only allow letter wrap such that word wrap no longer works. Beside that, I want the user to be able to wrap his text by hitting Enter. For that Im adding n to the text and with the fixes this will no longer affect the result and everythings going to be displayed in one line.p  pIm feeling like Ive spent years in the web to find a solution but unitl now nothing worked for my case, especially since it appeared to be the same fix all the time. I hope you guys can help me.p  pemThis means in summaryemp  pstrongWhat I havestrongp  ul liLine wraps word in case of long strings separated by spacesli liif you use Windows and your input contains line wraps created by hitting enter, they will also wrapli liIf you type in a very long string without spaces, the panel gets expanded and you need to resize the frameli liHTML formatting allows me to display different colors as well as hyperlinks and emoticonsli ul  pstrongWhat I needstrongp  ul liWord wrap behaviour like it is at the moment in case it is possible but letter wrap ONLY in case of long strings not separated by spaces to prevent the panel from expanding.li liManually added line wraps made by hitting ENTER in the input area or if I copy an pre formatted text into the input panelli liHTML formatting like I have alreadyli ul  pstrongWhat Ive tried and what didnt helpstrongp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6329967jtextpanedoesntwraptextjtextpane doesn39t wrap texta and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14217911jtextpaneisnotwrappingtextJTextPane is not wrapping textap  pHere is some code to try it yourself.

Ive tried to combine the fix for an HTMLEditorKit with an StlyedEditorKit Fix. But I have to be honest, I dont have any clue what I actually did there  The sad thing is, the manual line wraping does no longer work with this as a replacement of the HTMLEditorKit. Maybe you can use this as a base for some better implementation.p  pTo use it in my example just create a new class in the project with the CustomEditorKit and replace the HTMLEditorKit in the example with this CustomEditorKit. You will notice that word and letter wrapping works now, but if you hit ENTER to get your own line wrap this change will no longer appear in the outputpanel and everything will be displayed in one line. Another strange problem of it is, that if you resize the frame the lines will sometimes lay on each other.p  precodeimport javax.swing.SizeRequirements import javax.swing.text.Element import javax.swing.text.View import javax.swing.text.ViewFactory import javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit import javax.swing.text.html.InlineView import javax.swing.text.html.ParagraphView  SuppressWarningsserial public class CustomEditorKit extends HTMLEditorKit   Override public ViewFactory getViewFactory       return new HTMLFactory          Override         public View createElement e              View v  super.createe             if v instanceof InlineView                  return new InlineViewe                      Override                     public int getBreakWeightint axis, float pos, float len                          return GoodBreakWeight                                           Override                     public View breakViewint axis, int p0, float pos, float len                          if axis  View.XAXIS                              this.checkPainter                             this.removeUpdatenull, null, null                                                  return super.breakViewaxis, p0, pos, len                                                                else if v instanceof ParagraphView                  return new ParagraphViewe                      Override                     protected SizeRequirements calculateMinorAxisRequirementsint axis, SizeRequirements r                          if r  null                              r  new SizeRequirements                                                  float pref  this.layoutPool.getPreferredSpanaxis                         float min  this.layoutPool.getMinimumSpanaxis                          Dont include insets, Box.getXXXSpan will include them.                          r.minimum  int min                         r.preferred  Math.maxr.minimum, int pref                         r.maximum  Integer.MAXVALUE                         r.alignment  0.5f                         return r                                                                 return v                     codepre

Negative 7436 pIm developing an application using ASP.Net MVC 4 and need to be able to authorize users at a granular level  possibly data elements on a page, specific actions a user can take for a piece of data, etc.p  pIm currently assigning a person to a role and that role is assigned a permission view, add, edit, and delete for an activity.  The role and permission value Im using bitwise values of the permission is assigned to an activity.  Im currently defining an activity as an action in my ASP.Net MVC app.  So, in order to navigate to a MVC action, the user has to have at least View permission for that action, otherwise they cant access the action.  What that user can do within that action depends on their other permissions add, edit, delete.p  pThis is an OK approach.  All of the permissions are stored in my database, so Ive pretty much decoupled the permissions from the UI itself.  All I do is check to see if a user has say Add permission before showing a button to load a data entry form for example.  p  pIm pretty sure this approach is not going to be granular enough.  For example, if I need to hide a data column from User X in such and such role, then Im not sure how to accommodate that requirement with my approach.  Right now the View permission is all or nothing.p  pIm very very reluctant to inject a bunch of if statements in my view code controlling what is displayed to the user.  This is tightly coupling the UI to my security mechanism.  Not to mention you cant maintain this at all.p  pSo, Im stumped as to how to make a security mechanism more granular and yet maintain a nice clean separation.  When I think about this, Im leaping directly from my current approach to injecting a bunch of if statements in my code.  Im not seeing any alternatives.  Any advice, links to examples, etc. for best practices is much appreciated and needed.  Thanks for your time.p

Negative 7436 pIm developing a desktop application which is supposed to allow users to login via Twitter. There seems to be 2 ways to do so, that differ in a way oauthverifier is returned to the application.  The first one is for web applications and codeoauthverifiercode is returned as a url query parameter when redirecting user back to coderedirecturlcode. The second one is using a PIN displayed to the user, which user enters to the app.p  pNow Facebook, for example, has a page codefacebook.comconnectloginsuccess.htmlcode , where FB can redirect a user with codeouathverifiercode as a query param e.g. codefacebook.comconnectloginsuccess.htmlcodelttokengtcode. Then I can read that param back from the browsers location field Im using an embedded browser.p  pSo, is such a workflow possible with Twitter Does it have a static page, where it can redirect user with codeoauthverifiercode p

Negative 7436 pI benchmarked a Java program on a 16 core NUMA machine with Red Had Linux. I measured the throughput of a Java DatagramSocket for UDP in terms of how many packets of 64 Bytes size it was able to receive and send per second. The program consisted of a single socket and n threads that were listening on the socket. When a packet arrived, they would copy the payload into a byte[] array, create a new DatagramPacket with that array and send it straightaway back to where it came from. Think of it as a ping on the UDP layer.p  ol lipI found that the Java DatagramSocket socket achieves a significantly smaller throughput when using more than one thread, i.e. two or four. If I use only one thread to listen on the socket, I achieve a throughput of 122,000 packets per second, while more than one threads achieve only 65,000 packets per second. Now, I understand that a thread might be executed on any core of the NUMA machine and that memory accesses become expensive if the memory has to travel from one node to another. However, if I have two threads, only one should be executed on the wrong core, while the other should still achieve a very high throughput. Another possible explanation is a synchronization problem in the Datagramsocket but these are only guesses. Does anybody have a good insight in what the real explanation ispli lipI found that executing this program multiple times in parallel on multiple ports achieves a higher overall throughput. I started the program with one thread four times and each program used a socket on a separate port 5683, 5684, 5685 and 5686. The combined throughput of the four programs was 370,000 packets per second. In summary, using more than one thread on the same port decreases the throughput, while using more than one port with one thread each increases it. How is this explainablepli ol  pSystem specificationsp  pHardware 16 cores on 2 AMD OpteronTM Processor 6212 processors organized in 4 nodes with 32 GB RAM each.

My thought is that its pointless to have this class implement IDisposable, and youd be better off wrapping the use of dataAccess in a using statement. As I understand it, the expectation of a class that implements IDisposable is that a user of that class will instantiate it in a using block declaration. Is the above example bad practice considering no user will explicitly call Dispose If we rely on GC to clean up as in the above example, does the GC even call Dispose, or just the finalizerp

Negative 7436 pA somewhat openended question so any information that closes the gaps in my knowledge would be appreciated.p  pWhen doing a SQL Server upgrade from 2000 to 2008 the upgrade advisor can give the following warning The Upgrade Advisor detected one or more userdefined login names that match the names of fixed server roles. Fixed server role names are reserved in SQL Server 2008. Rename the login before upgrading to SQL Server 2008.p  pI believe this is because say for example a login of sysadmin in a sql server 2000 database will clash with a fixed server role of sysadmin in 2008..p  pIs there a way to safely drop and recreate these logins or could dropping a login of say sa have unintended consequencesp

Negative 7436 pSo I need to read a CSV file with minimal or reasonably close to minimal expenditure of memory using ObjectiveC. Right now I do it approximately like thisp  precodeNSData data  [NSData dataWithContentsOfFilefilename] NSString fileContents  [NSString stringWithUTF8String[data bytes]] NSArray rowStrings  [fileContents componentsSeparatedByStringr] for NSString rowString in rowStrings     Analyze row here     NSArray cells  [rowString componentsSeparatedByString,]     NSMutableArray row  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]     for NSString cell in cells         Analyze individual cell here       codepre  pBut this is not ok because it basically loads the whole file into memory and it goes downhill from there. I believe that I can use fscanf to get the results that I need, but I cannot figure out how this can be done. I could find plenty of examples online of fscanf being used to read files with a known number of cells comma separated values but I cannot find any examples of what to do when I want to use a file of arbitrary size. I figure that this should be done by separating the file by commas and every time a newline is found simply recognize this and do something about it, which in effect would allow me to read the file cell by cell, but I do not know how to do this with fscanf so if someone could help out that would be great.p  pThank you.p

Negative 7436 pSo far I have been getting a lot of help and been able to successfully put together a Python script. The script basically calls a Windows executable and then does some action like pulling down some files from a remote server. And at the end of the script I have a function which does a compression and moves the retrieved files to another server. So far the script was working great, but now looks like I have hit a road hurdle. p  pThe script basically accepts a ParentNumber as a input and finds 1 or more ChildNumbers. Once the list of ChildNumbers are gathered the script goes calls the windows executable with the number repeatedly till it completes pulling data for all of them. p  pAs mentioned above the Function I have built to Archive, Move Files and Email Notification is being called at end of the script, the function works perfectly fine if there is only one ChildNumber. If there are many ChildNumbers and when the executable moves on the 2nd ChildNumber the command line kinda treats it as end and stats with new line something like belowp  precode......... CScriptsstartscript.py Inputgt ParentNumber Retrieval started  Retrieval finished Email Sent Successfully Preparing ParentNumber childNumber  CScritpsParentNumber123childNumber2 Retrieval Started Retrieval finished ......... codepre  pbr If you see the script flow above the Email Sent successfully message shows up under first ChildNumber only, which means its called way before the completion of the script. p  pThe actual behavior I want is that all ArchiveMoveEmailFunction should be called once all of the ChildNumbers are processed, but not sure where its going wrong. p  pMy function for the ArchiveMoveEmailFunction as below and its at ending of all other lines in the scriptp  precodedef archiveMoveEmailNotificationstartTime, sender, receivers  Function to archive, move and email  Code for Archive Code for Move to remote server Code for email archiveMoveEmailNotificationstartTime, sender,receivers codepre  pPlease let me know if I am missing something here to specify on when exactly this function should be executed. As mentioned it works totally fine if the ParentNumber has only 1 ChildNumber, so not sure if the second retrieval jump is causing some issue here. Is there a way I can just have this function wait till rest of the functions in the script are called or would be be logical to move this function to another script completely and call that function from the master script p  pHere is the exe call partp  precodedef execExechildNumb  cmd  myExe retriveeAll u s l s  childNum.Url,childAccount.workDir return os.systemcmd  def retriveChildNumbchildNumb  Run the retrive if not execExechildNumb0     DisplayResultchildNumb,3 else     DisplayResultchildNumb,0  return 0 codepre  pAny inputs thoughts on this is very helpful.p

And my searching of this site and google hasnt yielded results. p  pAs I state at the end I can work around it, but I feel there is something simple I am missing.p  pAll the variables are direct, no pointers yet in the first for loop, intergerOfInterest is 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 10, 11 which is very random, I have tried swapping integerValueA2 for the calculation but with no effect.

I figure this cant be right so does anyone have an idea how I am getting this wrong.  Note if I add an extra variable to store the second instance of the number so in the first loop I use integerValueA  integerValueB  1  it works fine.p  pNote Edited to use naming conventions.p

Negative 7436 pWhen writing Java code, NetBeans often encourages me to convert foreach loops with iterators to lambda expressions. Sometimes the resulting code is much cleaner. Other times, the result is less clear than before.p  pFor example, the following uses iteratorsp  precodeListltStringgt list  new ArrayListltgt for String str  list      if str.charAt0              do something with str       codepre  pAnd the equivalent uses lambda expressionsp  precodeListltStringgt list  new ArrayListltgt list.stream.filterstr gt str.charAt0   .forEachstr gt       do something with str  codepre  pIn this case, using lambda expressions results in lengthier code, and uses less intuitive language codestreamcode, codefiltercode, and codeforEachcode instead of codeforcode and codeifcode. So are there any advantages to using lambdas instead of iterators,  when the code isnt cleaner For example, are there any performance gainsp
Negative 7436 pSo im writing a little program to practice for my exam coming up, and it involves creating a class file as well as an application file. Basically, im not sure if my setup will work because user input is required from the Scanner class, and im not aware of a method for Strings similar to, say, the nextInt or nextDouble methods. Here is a snippet of what I have written so far, and I was basically wondering how I could make the set methods im using work when I need to take user inputsome of my set methods use Strings and not primitive data types like an int or double. Just curious if my current format can work once I get around to the application class, or if I need to change my methods to use a numerical input instead of Strings and then use something like a switch or if statement later on to change those numerical values to a String. Here is what ive written so far, from the class filep  precodeimport java.text.DecimalFormat  public class GuitarStore      DecimalFormat dollar  new DecimalFormat,0.00     private int stockNumber    private int modelID    private int pickupType    private String color    private String brand    private String pickupType    private double totalValueOfStock     public GuitarStore         stockNumber  0    modelID  0    pickupID  0    color      brand      pickupType      totalValueOfStock  0.0          public GuitarStoreint stkNum, int modID, int pickID, String clor, String brnd,                       double totValOfStock          setStockstkNum    setModelmodID    setPickuppickID    setColorclor    setBrandbrnd    setTotalValuetotValOfStock           public void setStockstkNum            if stkNum gt 1 ampamp stkNum lt 500                    stockNumber  stkNum               else                     stockNumber  0                 public void setModelmodID           if modID gt 1 ampamp modID lt 1000                          modelID  modID               else                                      modelID  0                 public void setPickuppickID           if pickID gt 1 ampamp pickID lt 3                    pickupID  pickID               else                    pickupID  0                  public void setColorclor           if clor  red              color  clor       else if clor  blue             color  clor       else if clor  purple             color  clor       else if clor  green             color  clor       else if clor  white             color  clor       else             System.out.printlnWe do not carry that color codepre  pBasically, im most curious about the setColor method and ifhow it will work once I get to the application part of the program. In previous projects, ive just used numbers and not strings which I then converted to a string using a switch statement. This is something totally new to me and im going out on a limb trying something new. Since I need to take user input to determine what color they will want, im not sure how to parse that since I cant use a method like nextDouble or nextInt like I stated above. This is total practice so if anyone can tell me if I have a solid plan or not id appreciate it, and also what I should do to take the user input once I get to the application process for the set methods. Thanks, everyone here is always so helpful p

Up until now Ive been using the strongMac Terminal appstrong and posted like this codecurl F userid1 localhosttestwebservice.phpcode, but I dont know how to pass an array. p  pWhat I have so far is thisp  precodecurl F userid1 F titleRandom title 123 F numitems2 F items[][Item 1, Item 2] localhosttestwebservice.php codepre  pBut I dont think thats the correct way to pass an array, because I believe the code I have in my php document is correct, but the value thats stored in my database is literally the word strongarraystrong. I believe codeitems[]code is the correct way to start it, but Im not so sure about what comes after the codecodesign. p  pAnyone know the correct way to do thisp  pIf this happens to be correct, then theres something wrong with how I store the data in my array. Im using codestmtcode and the codebindparamcode keyword like thisp  precodeitems  POST[items]  This is the array  stmt  thisgtdbgtprepareINSERT INTO items itemid, userid, title VALUES , ,  stmtgtbindparamiis, itemid, userid, items stmtgtexecute stmtgtclose codepre  pWhat Im trying to achieve is basically posting all the values fron the array into the database with one insert statement. If thats wrong, what is the correct way to do itp  pAll help is appreciatedp  pThanks.p
Negative 7436 pI know that I can draw a filled circle and I can draw many simple and complicated things with a Graphics.

Negative 7436 pI did a little investigation to find out how the codeString.interncode method is implemented in java. p  pI looked at C implementation of Intern pool from Open JDK 6 and there I saw a simple codeHashSetcode. For me it meant that when someone are trying to intern a codeStringcode the next steps should be done p  ol lifinding hash code associated with the given codeStringcode li lifinding an appropriate bucketli licomparing the given String to all another Strings in the bucket. Before this step there may be 0 Strings, one String or a LOT OF Strings in the bucket. So if the given String has been previously put in the bucket we will get at least one comparison thats the best case. Of course there might have been a lot of collisions and now many other Strings are in the bucketli liIf the String has been found in the bucket then it should be returned by codeinterncode methodli liIf the String has not been found in the bucket then it should be put in the bucket and returned by codeinterncode methodli ol  pSo many people say that codestr1.intern  str2.interncode would be faster than codestr1.equalsstr2code. p  pBut I cannot see the reason it should be faster. p  pAs I can see in case of codestr1.equalsstr2code we always have two strings comparing char by char in codeString.equalscode method. p  pIn case of codestr1.intern  str2.interncode, how many comparisons we would have to get or to put the String tofrom the pool right, it can be a lot of comparisons and they are simple char by char comparisons too p  pSo in case of codestr1.intern  str2.interncode even if we use codecode to compare Strings we also will have many additional actions such as comparisons described previously.p  pWhen I understood it I decided to make some benchmark testing. p  pThe first results shewed me that codestr1.intern  str2.interncode was faster than codestr1.equalsstr2code. p  pThis behaviour was caused by the fact that codeString.interncode method is native so it shouldnt be interpreted every time and codeString.equalscode is a java method. p  pSo then I decided to use codeXcompcode option to make JVM compile all the code on start. p  pAfter that equals shewed a better speed than intern. p  pI tested it on Java 6 and 7.p  pSo my question is have you ever seen a situation when interning increased speed of String comparison I yes how can it be p  pOr maybe codeinterncode can only help to save more free memoryp

Negative 7436 pI am maintaining a portable class library that target major .NET and Mono platforms. The core PCL uses profile 147 .NET 4.03  Windows Store  Silverlight 5  Windows Phone 8, however due to some technical reasons the NuGet package consists of three versions core PCL profile 147, .NET 4 and Silverlight 5. Practically I could change the profile of the core PCL and replace .NET 4.03 with .NET 4.5 and drop Silverlight 5. I dont do this in case my lib will be consumed from other PCL  for this reason I would like to use the widest PCL.p  pSo my first question is whether this assumption is correct. E.g. even though I have separate SL5 implementation, choosing a PCL profile with SL5 support makes it more PCLfriendly, e.g. another PCL targeting SL5 would be able to reference my lib.p  pIf this assumption is correct, my next question is whether this is worth it. Now that there are popular PCL profile choices for Xamarin development, none of them targets .NET 4. And the one that is recommended is profile 78 that doesnt target Silverlight. I havent found a detailed description of consequences of not choosing these profiles, so I cant figure out what I am losing by staying with profile 147. If there are known problems and not supported functionality, I will of course swicth to a more modern profile, but as I wrote earlier Id like to target wider platform set if possible.p

Negative 7436 pA windows service viz strongEmailToolstrong, which was working fine earlier, has not been working  properly lately.p  pstrongService Overviewstrongp  ol liEmailTool is a windows service which polls a directory using FileWatchers. li liIt keeps watching the directory and upon receiving certain files it sends out emails to the users.li liThe path it watches is a shared path with different permissions for different users. My service uses a service account with Read permissions.li liThe receipt of files and sending of emails get logged to a file viz strongServiceLog.txtstrong.li liAn example to explain the workflow The folder with the name 21052014 a folder with the name as current date is created is created in the location mentioned above. In that folder few files arriveDate.txt, InputsLog20140520.txt, PToolStart20052014.txt, PToolEnd20052014.txt . The service thus sends a mail, logging every step in a log file for support operations.li ol  pstrongProblem facedstrongp  pThe EmailTool has not been working as expected since few days. The steps are not getting logged in the log file and the emails are not being sent out.p  pstrongSteps Takenstrongp  pWe have taken many steps to identify the problem. The following are few of themp  ol liTo prove that the code is working, we used the local file pathF drive of lower environment as the file path. The service worked fine and the mail was sent.li liWe tried using the shared path on a lower environment as the path. The service worked fine and mail was sent.li liWe tried using the shared path which is used in Production from other lower environments , where we created new folders and gave them appropriate permissions. This didnt work out.li ol  pAs is clear, the service, which was working earlier,  is not working for the shared paths which were used in Production. p  pstrongInformation worth Notingstrongp  ol liWhen we strongSTOPstrong and then strongSTARTstrong the service, and try to see the workflow by creating folder and moving in filesas mentioned in the service overview above, the service works for a couple of steps and then goes haywire. I can confirm this as I can see the steps for folder creation in the log file sometimesnot always. I am unable to understand why this works for a couple of steps and then stops to work as on other file servers it works perfectly.li liJust a day before the service went haywire, the shared path was moved to a different hadrware. We are almost sure that the problem has been caused by this. But the teams maintaining this shared path have confirmed that the permissions have been kept intact after the hardware migrations.li liI tried to debug the code by moving the code into a forms application and came up with the following numberscodesli ol  pstrongBaseExceptionstrongp  pBase exception area gave the following codesp  pErrorCode 2147467259 Native Error code  58p  pThe above native error code 58 points to the followinggoogle searchp  pERRORBADNETRESP 58 0x3A The specified server cannot perform the requested operation.p  pstrongInnerExceptionstrongp  pThe inner exception showed the following codep  pCOMPlusExceptionCode            532459699         intp  pstrongCodesstrongp  pthe service strongstartstrong event has this code snippetp  precode   mWatcher  new System.IO.FileSystemWatcher             mWatcher.Filter  .             mWatcher.Path  filWatcherPath             mWatcher.IncludeSubdirectories  true                mWatcher.NotifyFilter  NotifyFilters.LastAccess  NotifyFilters.LastWrite                                   NotifyFilters.FileName  NotifyFilters.DirectoryName             mWatcher.Created  new FileSystemEventHandlerOnChanged                mWatcher.Error  new ErrorEventHandlerOnError              mWatcher.EnableRaisingEvents  true codepre  pAs a workaround, we have used another file server temprarily which on which the service is working fine.

Negative 7436 pI am fairly new to matlab and I am trying to figure out when it is best to use cells, tables, or matrixes to store sets of data and then work with the data. p  pWhat I want is to store data that has multiple lines that include strings and numbers and then want to work with the numbers.p  pFor example a line would look likep  precodestring 1 , time, number1, number 2 codepre  p. I know a matrix works best if al elements are numbers, but when I use a cell I keep having to convert the numbers or strings to a matrix in order to work with them. I am running matlab 2012 so maybe that is a part of the problem. Any help is appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 7436 pI have just implemented a new database on our live environment, this database is fed information by a service brokers from our two transactional databases.  When the messages come into the new database we have a series of stored procedures which manipulate the feed for each specific user.p  pI also have another set of stored procedures which remanipulate the data by user instead of by vehicle, these are used by our maintenance screens to ensure we can change users visibility of the data. p  pThe below stored procedure keeps locking up  I have now amended this sp to update a temp table first and then just undertake one update against the main database, however this has not aided the situation, I have also amended so I can update in smaller batches and if this fails keep retrying until it is successful.  This works 100 on our dev environment but on live it keeps locking.   The throughput on the servicebrokers is not great enough to register the number of failures, I therefore believe I am locking myself within this spp  pI have included THIS UPDATE KEEPS LOCKING  at the point of failure.p  pWhat could be causing this locking behaviorp  precodeUSE [Isight] codepre  pGO strongstrong Object  StoredProcedure [dbo].[UserVisibilityForVehicles]    Script Date 07182014 144304 strongstrong SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GOp  pALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[UserVisibilityForVehicles]      Add the parameters for the stored procedure here Username VARCHAR50   WITH RECOMPILE AS BEGIN      SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from      interfering with SELECT statements.

Negative 7436 pI have a emJasperReportsem report that is based on JSON data.  I am trying to add a chart to display the values of the chartData array, but am not having any luck.  Heres what the JSON looks like.p  precode reportingData   dateRange January 1, 2014January 31, 2014, name  Name Goes Here  , chartData  [  name  Industry 1, value  10  ,  name  Industry 2, value  20  ,  name  Industry 3, value  30  ,  name  Industry 4, value  40  ,  name  Industry 5, value  50 ], pageNumber 1, nextPage  true  codepre  pWhen I add the chart to the report, Ive tried setting codeFchartDatacode as the key expression and then codeFnamecode as the label and codeFvaluecode as the value, but I get compilation errors because it cant find the fields called name or value.p  pIve also tried setting the key expression similar to what I do with subreports, something like thisp  precodenet.sf.jasperreports.engine.data.JsonDataSourcePREPORTDATASOURCE.subDataSourcechartData codepre  pbut still no dice.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions how I can use a JSON array with a emJasperReportsems chart  or how I need to reformat my JSON if necessary.p  p UPDATE  Still need help  Im not sure where the subDataSet element should go.  Also, Im guessing that in the subDataset Id want to use the chartData property rather than date range since thats the data for the chart, but what class should I use for that  still java.lang.String  The other approach you suggested is pretty much what I was trying see the original question except using the chartData property rather than the reportData property which is the data set for the whole report.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions  or if anyone could post the XML for a working chart that uses a subDataset.p  p UPDATE 2  STILL NO LUCK  Thank you for the reply.  I still cant get this to work.  I modified your code slightly because you were using reportingData as the name of the field containing the subDataset, but that is the name of the top level of the report.  The subdata should be using the chartData field.p  pHeres what Im using in the report now.  It shows a red error indicator in the eclipse plugin next to the line about the subDataset.p  precode        ltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt         lt Created with Jaspersoft Studio version lastgt         ltjasperReport xmlnshttpjasperreports.sourceforge.netjasperreports xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpjasperreports.sourceforge.netjasperreports httpjasperreports.sourceforge.netxsdjasperreport.xsd nameBlankA4 pageWidth595 pageHeight842 columnWidth555 leftMargin20 rightMargin20 topMargin20 bottomMargin20 uuid90544f77b0504811836551bb292ac717gt             ltproperty namecom.jaspersoft.studio.data.defaultdataadapter valueTESTFORCHARTgt             ltqueryString languagejsongt                 lt[CDATA[reportingData]]gt             ltqueryStringgt             ltsubDataset namechartData uuid2a00961e0d9c4bd2b124c4cad2fc24c9gt                 ltparameter namedefaultnulltext classjava.lang.Stringgt                 ltfield namename classjava.lang.Stringgt                     ltfieldDescriptiongtlt[CDATA[name]]gtltfieldDescriptiongt                 ltfieldgt                 ltfield namevalue classjava.lang.Stringgt                     ltfieldDescriptiongtlt[CDATA[value]]gtltfieldDescriptiongt                 ltfieldgt             ltsubDatasetgt             ltfield namedateRange classjava.lang.Stringgt                 ltfieldDescriptiongtlt[CDATA[dateRange]]gtltfieldDescriptiongt             ltfieldgt             ltfield namename classjava.lang.Stringgt                 ltfieldDescriptiongtlt[CDATA[name]]gtltfieldDescriptiongt             ltfieldgt             ltfield namechartData classjava.lang.Stringgt                 ltfieldDescriptiongtlt[CDATA[chartData]]gtltfieldDescriptiongt             ltfieldgt             ltfield namepageNumber classjava.lang.Stringgt                 ltfieldDescriptiongtlt[CDATA[pageNumber]]gtltfieldDescriptiongt             ltfieldgt             ltfield namenextPage classjava.lang.Stringgt                 ltfieldDescriptiongtlt[CDATA[nextPage]]gtltfieldDescriptiongt             ltfieldgt             ltbackgroundgt                 ltband splitTypeStretchgt             ltbackgroundgt             lttitlegt                 ltband height79 splitTypeStretchgt             lttitlegt             ltpageHeadergt                 ltband height35 splitTypeStretchgt             ltpageHeadergt             ltcolumnHeadergt                 ltband height61 splitTypeStretchgt             ltcolumnHeadergt             ltdetailgt                 ltband height252 splitTypeStretchgt                     ltpieChartgt                         ltchart evaluationTimeReportgt                             ltreportElement x200 y10 width200 height200 uuidd5b01ba16dea4465b44078b4ebf2af8dgt                             ltchartTitlegt                             ltchartSubtitlegt                             ltchartLegendgt                         ltchartgt                         ltpieDatasetgt                             ltkeyExpressiongtlt[CDATA[net.sf.jasperreports.engine.data.JsonDataSourcePREPORTDATASOURCE.subDataSourcechartData]]gtltkeyExpressiongt                             ltvalueExpressiongtlt[CDATA[0]]gtltvalueExpressiongt                         ltpieDatasetgt                         ltpiePlotgt                             ltplotgt                             ltitemLabelgt                         ltpiePlotgt                     ltpieChartgt                 ltbandgt             ltdetailgt             ltcolumnFootergt                 ltband height45 splitTypeStretchgt             ltcolumnFootergt             ltpageFootergt                 ltband height54 splitTypeStretchgt             ltpageFootergt             ltsummarygt                 ltband height42 splitTypeStretchgt             ltsummarygt         ltjasperReportgt codepre  pPlease let me know if you have any suggestions.p

The CalculationData array contains all data I would like to show in a pdfexport. So I post it to PHP and generate a pfdfile using fpdf. Now, I would like to make the complete application available in multiple languages. I already changed the JS part and generated an array for the languagestrings. To keep this clear and easy to update, I would like to use the same languagearray in php. So my main problem is, how to get my second string to php. I thought it would be nice, to add the languagearray to the calculationData array and I tried this many different ways. For examplep  precodevar calculationData       data1 Data1,     data2 Data2   var languageData       str1 first String,     str2 second String   calculationData.languageData  languageData codepre  pThis and many other ways as well works just fine in javascript and I can easily access the data usingp  precodevar a  calculationData.languageData.str1 codepre  pIf I try to access the data in PHP however using codePOST[languageData][str2]code, I always get some error messages, that the index is not defined or out of range. When looking at the transferred data using codeprintrcode, I can see, that the codecalculationData.languageDatacode or in this case, my codePOST[languageData]code is empty.p  pCan anyone help me to understand, what I am doing wrong I am trying for hours now and do not really know, which way to approach that problem best or what to search for.

Negative 7436 pIm writing a code, which handles some hardware accessible via certain communication interface. Id like to define certain sets of registers as properties of the object describing the whole device. Lets assume, that I have functions codehwreadaddress, sizecode and codehwwriteaddress, size, arrayofvaluescode, which allow to access the hardware.p  pLets assume, that I have a block of registers with length 2, starting from address 10, and want to assign it to a property reg1. I can do it in a following wayp  precodeclass myhardwareobject   def initself      Perform initialization     return   property   def reg1self       return hwread10,2   reg1.setter   def reg1self,value       hwwrite10,2,value codepre  pThe above implementation is not very convenient, as I have to provide address and size twice. It is error prone, especially if I have to define bigger number of registers. Is it possible to implement it in such a way, that I could easily define set a few registers like belowp  precodedev1myhardware dev1.defineregisterreg1,10,2 dev1.defineregisterreg2,12,6 codepre  pAnd then access them viap  precodedev1.reg10x1234,0x3211 print dev1.reg2 codepre  pThe second approach has also significant advantage, that list of registers their names, addresses and sizes may be read from an external text file e.g. used also for VHDL synthesis.p  pstrongUpdate  possible solutionstrongp  pAfter studying soe posts related to dynamical adding of properties, I have achieved the required functionality with the code shown belowp  precodedef hwwrite first,size,val     print writestrfirst, strsize valstrval  def hwread first,size     print readstrfirst, strsize     return 0x1234,size  class myhardwareobject     def initself         return     def addregself,name,first,size         setattrmyhardware,name,propertylambda self  hwreadfirst,size, lambda self, x hwwritefirst,size,x codepre  pBelow are sample results with dummy hwread and hwwrite functionsp  precodegtgtgt amyhardware gtgtgt a.addregreg1,10,2 gtgtgt a.addregreg2,20,3 gtgtgt a.reg1 read10, 2 4660, 4660 gtgtgt a.reg2 read20, 3 4660, 4660, 4660 gtgtgt a.reg110, 11 write10, 2 val10, 11 gtgtgt a.reg210, 11, 12 write20, 3 val10, 11, 12 codepre  pIll appreciate any suggestions whether the above solution is reasonable.p  pOne problem or feature which I can see, is that registers are defined per class, not per instance.

Negative 7436 pI have searched for the plugin that I need but couldnt solve my problem. I have images on the page and I need to make the clicked image to enlarge to fill whole the viewport ant fit to one side  of the screen either horizontal or vertical plane. I am creating a div element and append it to the body. I am putting an additional div conatining an image element with proper src taken by the clicked element data sources. Images are either horizontal or vertical. most of the time they are needed to be fill to width of the viewport and height will be overflowhidden. I want to scroll to bottom to see the bottom of the image and  if it is desired it is needed to be zoomable. At zoomed in position I need to be able to pan in horizontally and verticaly. Some images maybe will be smaller than the viewport I am scaling them to with the width.p  pI tried the jparallax plugin it seems to work but I couldnt add any extra button form next and previosu buttons. I used some zoom plugins like imgViewer it is also seems to work enough. But when I zoom the image the scollpan plugin does not update its values to adapt the situation while it is not designed for this.p  pHow can  solve this problem.p  pThansk for your atteniton.p

From this I extract random code7x7code patches to feed to kmeans which has 100 centroids. This means I have a dictionary of 100 atoms. So given an image to classify I first extract patches from this image with codeextractpatches2dcode, which if I am not mistaken is also called a hrefhttpufldl.stanford.eduwikiindex.phpFeatureextractionusingconvolution relnofollowconvolutional samplinga.

Negative 7436 pI am trying to write a script that makes use of the json and requests modules. Before I wrote the script, I was playing around with commands on the interactive shell, and since creating an actual file for my code, everything has somehow broken. The first time I ran the code, a strongpycachestrong folder appeared in the folder and I think that is somehow breaking everthing. The code, when run line by line in the shell, no longer works either with the presence of this strongpycachestrong folder. My code is as followsp  precodeimport json import requests r  requests.gethttpapi.wunderground.comapi78c2f37e6d924b1bhourlyqCABerkeley.json data  json.loadsr.text for x in range0, 35     printdata[hourlyforecast][x][FCTTIME][hour] codepre  pThis should print out all the hours in the weather forecast, but I get an AttributeError module object has no attribute dumps. In this folder, I also previously had another program that used external modules that also no long works with the presence of the strongpycachestrong folder, so I am almost certain that it is causing the problems. However, deleting it doesnt fix anything as the code still doesnt work, and it just gets recreated.p  pEDIT The problem was solved by deleting the entire buggy directory and rewriting everything.p

Negative 7436 pI am curious about the terminology used in embedded firmware design. I am currently working on a project that uses WinCE 7. Studying the existing code, Ive gone through multiple high and low level documents talking about modules, processes, and threads. I decided to do some research to be able to relate the definitions to the existing code architecture. p  pWhat I do understand or think i understand is that threads are subprocesses of a process, i.e. a process is made up of threads or lightweight processes. The functionality of a process is that of clicking on an the microsoft word icon and the respective threads execute as needed to perform the process. A thread is a small, focused process which takes care of a specific part of the main process. Correct me if i am wrong in my understanding of threads and processes.p  pWhere i am lost is with the difference between processes and modules. If processes are the execution of threads required to perform a task, such as clicking on the MS Word icon, then what is a modulep  pThe way they have described the firmware is by saying something along the lines of The system architecture will consist of 7 modules. Each module is responsible for a certain functionality such as data storage, data processing, user interface, etc.... From that, i gather that these modules that are listed under the Subprojects folder of my visual studio project are the high level system design, each containing subfiles .cpp.h which make up the processes and inside these processes are the threads functionsclasses, etc... Is my understanding correctp  pThanks in advance and sorry for the long question.p

Negative 7436 pIve started using SourceTree and Git recently, but I am still confused about stashingbranching and my working copy files. Ive been having trouble finding anything out there that clarifies things for me.p  pMy confusion is with regards to the working copy of files in relation to branches and stashes. The way I am expecting things to work is that my working copy of files will also be linked to the branch. If I am to switch branches, it will automatically stash my working copy before switching to the new branch. If I am to switch back to the previous branch, it will again stash the current working copy files and restore the ones from the previous branch.p  pAfter working with SourceTree and Git for a little while now, it appears pretty clear to me that this is not how it works and that your working copy files are completely independent from your branches, as are stashes. If you switch to another branch, your choices are to manually stash your working copy files, discard the changes, or bring your working files with you to the new branch.p  pSo, what I am wondering is, what is the ideal workflow for this Say I am developing two features simultaneously in two different branches and want to constantly jump back and forth. Do I need to remember to stash my working copy files before every time I switch or is there a better approach to thisp

Negative 7436 pI have NumericUpDown control in windows forms. I want all its values to be greater than 1 up to the maximum value possible for that control. Since the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.numericupdown.maximumvvs.110.aspx relnofollowcodeMaximumcodea property is of type decimal, and the maximum decimal value can be found in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.decimal.maxvalue28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeDecimal.MaxValuecodea, is there a neat way to set the codeMaximumcode property value of the NumericUpDown control to codeDecimal.MaxValuecode in the properties window I could copy the numeric value of codeDecimal.MaxValuecode and paste it into the properties window, but that wont be neat, if you know what I mean. p  pThe property window does not allow setting the codeMaximumcode property to codeDecimal.MaxValuecode as it probably treats it as a string and throws a codeDecimal.MaxValue is not a valid value for Decimalcode error.p
Negative 7436 pHeres the current problem I have an XFA Form created by a 3rd party and I would like to use it as is.  I was able generate the PDF with filled fields byp  precodea Extracting the XML via Acrobat Pro b filling the fields within the XML and calling              XfaForm xfa  form.getXfa             xfa.fillXfaFormnew FileInputStreamXML codepre  pWhat Im trying to do is just stamp an imagewatermark over the 2nd page which has a form wmultiple fields.  The DRAFT png image Im stamping has a transparent background so if the overlay works, the image background should make the underlay appear and look like that the image text is sitting on top of the pdf page.p  pWhat I wanted to accomplish would have been trivial if this was not an XFA form.  I would just use iTexts pdfStamper and stamp this transparent PNG over the 2nd page, but since Im now confined to use Adobe LiveCycle Designer, I noticed that this once trivial task in the non XFA document isnt so trivial within XFA. From a previous post, I learned that I couldnt mix technologies together.  I had to choose between nonXFA AcroForms vs XFA built by Adobe LiveCycle Designer.  Basically, I couldnt do a fillXFA then use the stamper, so I had to figure out how to do this using XFA.p  pIve tried the following steps as a static PDF and a dynamic PDF....it didnt make a difference what type the PDF was.p  p1 Within Adobe LiveCycle Designer, I went to the second page of the source PDF and defined 2 image fields.p  precode  overlay1  this will span the top portion width of the page which has text               content underneath   overlay2  this will span the lower portion width of the page which has text               content underneath codepre  p2 As a test...I selected an image for overlay1 which has a transparent background and its    foreground background as DRAFT    At design time...the DRAFT transparency image worked and it was laid on top of the content correctly       for the imageField overlay1.    I saved the modified XFAbased PDF, opened it up in Acrobat Pro, and exported the XFA XML structure.    I verified that overlay1 had the DRAFT image as a base64 encoded string.p  precodeltoverlay1 xmlnsxfahttpwww.xfa.orgschemaxfadata1.0 xfacontentTypeimagepng gtiVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAACWAAAAJYCAYAAADmY91UAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AABH ....... ....... codepre  p3 When I took the same base 64 string and only entered its content within overlay2 and rendered it through the fillXFA method...the image was a black box instead.    I also opened the file in Acrobat Pro, then double clicked on the imageField area, selected the transparent image, and it still showed up as a black box.     I repeated the previous step with an image wno transparency and its rectangular white background    overlayed everything underneath it.p  p4 I went ahead and made another image...one that didnt have any transparency.    DRAFT with no transparency and its background is white.    I had it encoded in base64 format.    I was able to place it within both overlay1 amp overlay2 image fields without any problems.    The new problem is that the white background of the DRAFT images covered everything behind it.p  pWhy did the initial transparent png work during the Adobe LifeCycle Design design time and after    a fillXFA call it shows up as a black box  But if I change the image to not use transparency at    all...everything worksp  pDoes XFA not support transparent images for image fields during an xfa fill  Remember, it worked during design time when I told Adobe LiveCycle designer to use this transparent png for this field.p  pIm basically trying to create 2 image watermarks over a specific page within an XFA pdf.p  pMy current backup plan is to flatten the PDF take off the XFA and putting back all the fields back on the form using Acrobat Pro and filling it using the standard PDF itext calls and using a stamper this is going to be tedious since theres a bunch of fields.  But Id like to know if anyone ever had to do the same wan XFA PDF form before I look at option B.p

Negative 7436 pI am trying to build an application that does not have to be super performant in general, except for the timestamp of a keyboard press or external controller button press. I would like the timestamp to be as precise as possible, preferably down to  5ms. This is for a scientific application. What is the best programming paradigm to achieve this with minimal latency Which of the following is preferablep  pa Create a worker thread that runs in a higher priority and loops to see if a key was pressed. Use codeSleepxcode where codexcode is less than 5. p  pb Create an keyboard hook, which has an asynchronous callback.p  pc Another option.p  pIn addition to an answer, any code or link to sample would be much appreciated since I am a reasonably new dev.p  pEDIT Nomenclature. Should have been more careful. By timestamp, I mean time in general, not necessarily the full Day Month Year Hour Minute Second Millisecond. I was planning on using the StopWatch class from the beginning, because all I need is the time between the start of an event in the program and the time of the button press.

This table alone accounts for over 99.9 of the total database size.p  pstrongThe questionstrong Considering that the solution is log table notwithstanding very small, with only a few staff members making data entry via some simple PHP forms, is there a realistic problem with running Crystal Reports against such a database in production Bearing in mind that there are times during the day  the majority of the day in fact  when this database is simply not being used. Lunchtimes for example and out of hours.p  pThe vendor maintains that there is a fundamental risk to the business to query live data and that running Crystal Reports against this database could cause it to crash the live db and the business loses operations.p  pThe customer is keen to have a live dashboard too which could be written with a very small SQL query to aggregate some numbers from those small tables listed above.p  pI usually work with SQL Server and Oracle and I have absolutely no qualms about allowing a Crystal Report or running a view to populate a UI with some real time data from the live database  especially a database this small after all what is the database for if one cannot SELECT from it now and againp  pstrongIs it necessary, to avoid hanging the server and to avoid querying when other operations are occurring on the server, to replicate this MySQL database to a second, reporting database In my experience, the need to do this only applies to sensitive, securityrisk or databases with high transactional volumes.strongp  pstrongSystem usagestrong The system is heavily reliant on scheduled CRON jobs every half hour. There may be 500 users per week each logging on and entering some data but not much data  see table sizes above.p  pAny comments are warmly welcome.p  pThanks for your time.p
Negative 7436 pI have been trying for a week now to reduce the number of requests on our web application but I cant seem to combine the code.axdcode files. I got a suggestion from somewhere which worked locally development box but doesnt work on our test and production environment as they are both on codeHTTPScode. The developer didnt comment on that and the component he wrote was last updated in 2011.

Negative 7436 pBelow is my script to check root path integrity, to ensure there is no vulnerability in PATH variable.p  precode binbash  if [ echo PATH  bingrep     ] then     echo Empty Directory in PATH   fi  if [ echo PATH  bingrep       ] then echo Trailing  in  PATH  fi  pecho PATH  binsed e s e s e s g set  p while [ 1   ] do     if [ 1  . ] then         echo PATH contains . shift         continue     fi     if [ d 1 ] then         dirpermbinls ldH 1  bincut f1 d          if [ echo dirperm  bincut c6    ] then             echo Group Write permission set on directory 1         fi         if [ echo dirperm  bincut c9    ] then             echo Other Write permission set on directory 1         fi         dirownls ldH 1  awk print 3         if [ dirown  root ]  then             echo 1 is not owned by root         fi     else         echo 1 is not a directory     fi     shift done codepre  pThe script works fine for me, and shows all vulnerable paths defined in the PATH variable. I want to also automate the process of correctly setting the PATH variable based on the above result. Any quick method to do that.p  pFor example, on my Linux box, the script gives output asp  precodeusrbinX11 is not a directory rootbin is not a directory codepre  pwhereas my PATH variable have these defined,and so I want to have a delete mechanism, to remove them from PATH variable of root. lot of lengthy ideas coming in mind. But searching for a quick and not so complex method please. p
Negative 7436 pI am iterating through all files in a folder recursively though all its sub folders but this is extremely slow..it almost never returns.

Negative 7436 pI have a Python Script that I am running to take data from a CSV and insert it into my MS SQL Server.  The CSV is about 35 MB and contains about 200,000 records with 15 columns.

Negative 7436 pIve been using a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilconcurrentlocksReadWriteLock.html relnofollowReadWriteLockas to implementmaintain a locking idioms. p  pSince JDK8 a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavautilconcurrentlocksStampedLock.html relnofollowStampedLocka has been introduced. And as RWLocks are known with their slowness and bad performance, StampedLocks look like an alternative they are not reentrant, so much faster. p  pHowever except the performance, it looks to me that StampedLocks are much harder and complex to maintain and use  e.g. threads can now deadlock against themselves  so corresponding actions should be taken.p  pWhat are the benefits of StampedLock over RWLock p

Negative 7436 pHere is a specific example. I have a record type with floating point fields and I would like to be able to compare instances of this type for equality but of course the default compilergenerated implementation of structural equality and comparison doesnt account for floating point imprecision, so you can get false positives and negatives in your comparisons.p  pIn my application I have lots of records with many floating point fields each. What would be nice is if I could slap a digits of precision attribute on my floating point fields or on the whole record, to tell the compiler to compare floating point values for equality using that many digits of precision. I could override Equals, GetHashCode, and IComparable.CompareTo but it is quite a lot of typing and a heavy maintenance burden.p  pI guess the other option is a code generator tool to spit out all these overrides for me.p

Negative 7436 pI am trying to create a child AppDomain many, actually that has no direct tie to the assemblies included in the parent AppDomain. Im finding that despite my best efforts to isolate the target assemblies from the host, the static constructors in the host are executed in the child domain even if the assembly has not been explicitly loaded into the child domain.p  pA little more detail. I am trying to create a remoting server for internal and personal use only  thus security is not really a consideration. I am sending over the wire the target assembly that contains the execution function as well as all dependencies and saving them in a directory with their proper names. All assemblies load up correctly from disk within the target child domain. When I am in the resolve event handler for the child domain, I can call AppDomain.Current.GetAssemblies and only those assemblies which I have sent over the wire and have already loaded by that point are listed. However, when I go to run the target function in the target assembly, the static constructors for classes in assemblies that are only present the parent domain execute, which in my case is completely undesirable as there are static constructors that initialize network libraries, etc. With enough of these, the host application runs out of memory. It may be a case of bad design, but nonetheless I do not want any of the libraries in the parent AppDomain being executed as a result of trying to execute code that only exists in the child AppDomain.p  pGiven this explanation and no code yet, do these symptoms sound like anything you have dealt with before I am happy to provide code when I can get a test case working outside of this massive project but it may be a day or two. Any help or diagnosis in the meantime is much appreciatedp

Negative 7436 pI will try to describe what Im aiming for in my project.p  h1Backgroundh1  pIm building a website in MVC5 using Razor. This website will use the Identity Model for authorization and authentication. Ive managed to extract the models and controllers only those needed for identity management to a separate class library for easy reuse since Im planing to use the same logic for several websites.p  h1The Views are still within my web projecth1  pEven though Ive created my separate class library containing all the models and controllers the logic basically, I still need to add and maintain all the views only those for the identity part within each web application.p  pThis will create problems from a maintenance perspective.p  h1My goalh1  pMy goal is to make it easy to maintain, yet flexible to extendoverride in certain websites.p  pSo, either Ill create HtmlHelperclasses extensions that output a loginbox for example. That could look something like thisp  precodeHtml.MyHelpers.LoginBox codepre  pThat would output something like thisp  precodeltform methodpost actionMyActiongt     ltinput typetext nameemail gt     ltinput typetext namepassword gt     ltinput typesubmit valueLog in gt ltformgt codepre  pI know I can do this with a string and output to the response, but I would like to make use of the model itself the UserModel in this case. By doing that I can utilize the functionality for verification of email, display name etc. This approach still require me to add views to my web application, but I dont need to wire up all models to labels etc.p  h1Alternative approachh1  pAnother way of doing this might be compiled views. This will not require any views for handling the identity within each web application. However, if I need to tweak the login view for one of those web applications, I could do this by adding a view to the exact same path as the compiled one. Im not to sure which approach is best.p  h1Now, the questionsh1  ol lipI have yet to find a good sample or tutorial out there that covers creating a form in code behind and adding other input types, labels, text , AntiForgeryToken etc using a model and then render everything in HTML. Does any of you know such tutorial or samplepli lipGiven the situation, background and goal which approach do you think is easiest to implement, maintain and overridepli ol  pBig thanks in advancep  pFredrikp  pPS The last question is more of a discussion, so forgive me for asking.p

Negative 7436 pIn the Rob Eisenbergs a hrefhttpeisenbergeffect.bluespire.comallaboutangular20 relnofollowblog  all about angular 2.0a, written in november 2014, he talked about some new features of angular 2.0. When talking about whether Angular 2.0 should contintue to 2 way binding in 2.0, he stood at the side of 2 way binding, he says p  pIve heard some explanations related to enforcing DAG for data flow. This idea has been recently made popular by ReactJS. But frankly, you cant completely enforce that. strongI can break it by simply using an event aggregator.strong This is a pattern that is very common in composite applications. I think you should teach people about DAG and help them to adhere to it when possible, but you cant force them. That makes it hard to do their job.p  pSo here is my question p  pHow does the event agregator break the data flow, contructed by a directed acyclic graphDAG  ReacJS implements 1 way binding hierarchy. It uses DAG for reconstructing the app states tree. Can you give me an example, like Rob says, breaking the data flow with event agregatorp  pThank you p

Negative 7436 pI have a software suite that consists of multiple integrated software packages. They all run off of a single centralised SQL database.p  pWe are in the stage where we are writing test plans and have allocated a single test plan for each independent module of the software. The only one left to write is the test plan for the reporting module. This particular module does nothing but run reports on the data in the SQL database which will be written by the other modules.p  pAny testing iterations are preceded by developer, regression and integration testing, which should remove any issues of the database data not being correctly maintained.p  pMy dilemma is how to approach the black box test plan for the reporting module. The way I see it there are three optionsp  ul liAppend the reporting test cases to the test plans for the modules that influence them downside the modules work together to produce the reports reports cannot be divided up by module like thatli liWrite a test plan for reporting with specified prerequisites, that are essentially a list of instructions of tasks to perform in the other modules, followed by test cases to test that the reporting is producing correctly in response to these tasks downside very complicated and longwindedli liWrite a test plan for reporting with set datasets on a dedicated controlled SQL database downside lack of flexibilityli ul  pIt looks to me that the second option is the best. Its the longestwinded but that alone is hardly a reason to discount something.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with testing a module purely for reporting, who can hopefully provide an insight into the best  industrystandard ways to do thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7436 pI got a song id from a playlist in MediaStore, using p  precodelong id  cursor.getLongcursor.getColumnIndexMediaStore.Audio.Playlists.Members.AUDIOID codepre  pand the id is correct, but as the only other data available is CONTENTDIRECTORY, DEFAULTSORTORDER, PLAYLISTID, PLAYORDER, and ID, I am not sure how to get the important parts of the song. I need the title, album, artist, etc., as if I was going through MediaStore.Audio.Media to get Song info.p  pI found an answer that I tried to modify to fit my needs, but I dont really understand querying or cursors, I am not sure how if there is a way to get a song.p  pIf the only way to do this is to cycle through emevery single songem until i find a matching ID i can do that, but it is wildly inefficient and there has to be a better way.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7436 pIm looking at a potential solution to a responsive problem.p  pFirstly, Im aware that media queries play a part in this and that I can set breakpoints and even minor breakpoints. This is something that I already do.p  pHowever, what I want to do is a little beyond this. I would like to alter the styling on my child html when the overall width would cause the child content to wrap inside its parent, making a more dynamic solution.p  pTake this examplep  precodeltnav classparent stylewidth500gt     ltul classinlinelistgt         ltligtItem 1ltligt         ltligtItem 2ltligt         ltligtItem 3ltligt         ltligtItem 4ltligt  uhho, this wont fit  wrap it         ltligtItem 5ltligt     ltulgt ltnavgt codepre  pIt represents a navigation structure. I would like to stack it when the content becomes too large. The easiest way would be to attach a class to the parent using javascript  this would allow me to stack rather than wrap, and to do it more elegantly than I could achive with just media queries.p  pThe question is how is it possible to detect if the contact is in fact wider than its parent p
Negative 7436 pIm administering a system used by around 100 users. Everything is working fine except for one user. When that user logs in, the source will only output about 70 lines og html and then just stop executing. PHP show no errors whatsoever, and nothing is shown in the error log. Errors is enabled in the script.p  pIf i remove some lines, in the html, it will execute more PHP, but then still stop at about 70 lines in the source code.p  pThis, as I said, only happens for one user. p  pDoes anyone have an idea about what could be going wrong herep

Negative 7436 pFirst time posting. I have a program written in C that I would like to be able to use a joystick with, more specifically an Xbox 360 controller. I have installed xboxdrv under Ubuntu 14.04 Ltd using the following instructions from another thread here a hrefhttpaskubuntu.comquestions165210howdoigetanxbox360controllerworkinghttpaskubuntu.comquestions165210howdoigetanxbox360controllerworkingap  precode    sudo aptaddrepository y pparaelgcubuntuxboxdrv     sudo aptget update     sudo aptget install ubuntuxboxdrv codepre  pRunning jstestgtk strangely sees 4 joysticks, but opening  js0 reads the input from the controller with no problem. Everything works swimmingly, and I am a letter to read the controller with the line p  precode    int fd  open devinputjs0, ORDONLY codepre  pfrom the example here a hrefhttpswww.kernel.orgdocDocumentationinputjoystickapi.txt relnofollowhttpswww.kernel.orgdocDocumentationinputjoystickapi.txtap  pThe problem arises when the controller is unplugged and then plugged back in. Now, regardless of whether or not the controller is inserted back into the same USB port, the controller is now being read on js1.The player indicator light also switches from player 1 to player 2, and repeating the plugging action will continue to increment the player. This is a problem, as there are only 4 joysticks to read from and 4 players for the controller, causing the Xbox controller lights to blink after the fourth player and not allowing me to hard code the line above. Only a restart seems to fix the problem. How do I remove these phantom controllers so as to be able to reuse js0p
Negative 7436 pUsing Storyboards and Autolayout, I have a UIViewController with a UIScrollView as the main view. I have several container views embedded in the scroll view. Some of those embedded container views contain UITableViews, each having cells of different heights. Ill need the tableViews height to be large enough to show all cells at once, as scrolling will be disabled on the tableView.p  pIn the main UIViewController, container views height has to be defined in order for the scroll view to work properly. This is problematic because theres no way for me to know how large my tableView will be once all its cells of varying heights are finished rendering. strongHow can I adjust my container views height at runtime to fit my nonscrolling UITableViewstrongp  pSo far, Ive done the followingp  precode in embedded UITableViewController    voidviewDidLoad     force layout early so I can determine my tables height   [self.tableView layoutIfNeeded]    if self.detailsDelegate          [self.detailsTableDelegate didDetermineHeightForDetailsTableViewself.tableView]       in my main UIViewController  I have an IBOutlet to a height constraint set up on my container view  this initial height constraint is just temporary, and will be overridden  once this delegate method is called  voiddidDetermineHeightForDetailsTableViewUITableView tableView    self.detailsContainerHeightConstraint.constant  tableView.contentSize.height  codepre  pThis is working fine and I was pleased with the results. However, I have one or two more container views to add, which will have nonscrolling tableViews, and Id hate to have to create a new delegate protocol for each container view. I dont think I can make the protocol I have generic.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 7436 pTo execute a php file, you can run it through the command line interface like so codephp somefile.phpcode. But how does a server like nginx or apache communicate with php, how does it know when to interpret the file, for instance will it interpret the file everytime a user requests to see the pagep  pI ask this because I actually want to create a toy language like PHP, Im aware this is quite a nontrivial task, but I want to do it to learn more about web servers, and serverside scripting languages, etc.p
Negative 7436 pI need to record user login and logout events using the new session id generated after a successful authentication when protecting against session fixation.  I noticed the sessionId value in the Details object of the Authentication object does not get updated after the new session is created.  Ive spent the last two days reading a lot of the javadoc and searching for answers on the web.  I found a hrefhttpforum.spring.ioforumspringprojectssecurity102024incorrectauthenticationdetailsessionidinauthenticationsuccesseventeventp551154post551154 relnofollowthis old posta by Luke Taylor.  I tried his suggestion but it did not seem to work, so I tried creating a CustomWebAuthenticationDetails that allowed me to set the sessionId to the new value I couldnt extend WebAuthenticationDetails because instance variable sessionId is final and then using a CustomSessionAuthenticationStrategy that extended SessionFixationProtectionStrategy and overrode method onSessionChange. In this method, I updated the Details object in the Authentication object with an instance of CustomWebAuthenticationDetails that contained the new sessionId. This seemed to work, but once I logged out and logged back in, I got a java.lang.ClassCastException org.springframework.security.web.authentication.WebAuthenticationDetails cannot be cast to org...CustomWebAuthenticationDetails.  I understood why I got the exception, so after searching some more, I tried creating a CustomWebAuthenticationDetailsSource and injecting it into an instance of UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter, but got an error saying authenticationManager must be specified.  When I tried to also inject the AuthenticationManager, I realized I couldnt because Im using a RemoteAuthenticationManager with my application.  At this point, I dont know what else to to try, so any suggestions will be much appreciated.p  pI would also like to know the reason why the sessionId is not updated in the Authentication object after a new session is created to protect against session fixation.  Would doing this make the application less secure  If so, howp  pThanks,p  pPatp

Negative 7436 pIm conducting a factor analysis of several variables in R using codefactanalcode but am open to using other packages. I want to determine each cases factor score, but I want the factor scores to be unstandardized and on the original metric of the input variables. When I run the factor analysis and obtain the factor scores, they are standardized with a normal distribution of mean0, SD1, and are not on the original metric of the input variables. How can I obtain unstandardized factor scores that have the same metric as the input variables Ideally, this would mean a similar mean, sd, range, and distribution.p  pI asked a a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions16588452obtainingunstandardizedfactorscoresfromfactoranalysissimilar questiona previously, but the respondents answer involved rescaling standardized i.e., normally distributed factor scores. Note that I dont want to transform standardized factor scores to unstandardized ones because the distributions of my indicators are nonnormal i.e., the normal distribution of standardized factor scores cannot be easily transformed to the raw metric of my indicators. In other words, Id like to estimate unstandardized factor scores on the raw metric of the indicators without first estimating them on a standardized metric.p  pAlso, there are some missing data.  How can I obtain unstandardized factor scores for all cases, even those who dont have data on all itemsp  pHeres a small examplep  precodelibrarypsych  v1 lt c1,1,1,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,4,5,6 v2 lt c1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,3,4,3,3,3,4,6,5 v3 lt c3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,4,6 v4 lt c3,3,4,3,3,1,1,2,NA,1,1,1,2,1,1,5,6,4 v5 lt c1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,6,4,5 v6 lt c1,1,1,2,1,3,3,3,4,3,1,1,NA,2,1,6,5,4 m1 lt cbindv1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6  m1FactorScores lt factanalv1v2v3v4v5v6, factors  1, scores  Bartlett, na.actionna.excludescores  describem1 means2.3, sds1.5 describem1FactorScores mean0, sd1 codepre  pThe data above are just a small example. My actual data are not likertordinal data. They are forecasts of football players passing yards from various sources. My hope is that a latent average would more accurately forecast players passing yards than an average because it would discard the unique biases of each source. The data are highly positively skewed, however, and forcing the latent variable and its factor scores to be normally distributed results in implausibly high values for many players e.g., over 6,000 yards passing next season.p

And the background image style is being applied fine already.p

Negative 7436 pThis is more of a conceptual question because Im planning how best to achieve our goals here. p  pI have a postgresqlpostgis table with 5 columns.  Ill be insertingappending data into the database from a csv file every 10 minutes or so via the copy command. There will likely be some duplicate rows of data, so Id like to copy the data from the csv file to the postgresql table but prevent any duplicate entries from getting into the table from the csv file.  There are three columns, where if they are all equal, that will mean the entry is a duplicate.  They are latitude, longitude and time.  Should I make a composite key from all three columns  If I do that, will it just throw an error upon trying to copy the csv file into the database  Im going to be copying the csv file automatically so I would want it to go ahead and copy the rest of the file that arent duplicates and not copy the duplicates.  Is there a way to do thisp  pAlso, I of course want it to look for duplicates in the most efficient way.  I dont need to look through the whole table which will be quite large for duplicates...just the past 20 minutes or so via the timestamp on the row.  And Ive indexed the db with the time column.p  pThanks for any helpp

I need to read the line of record, then process the record which generally takes 5 to 10 seconds and then update the record with new value.p  pThe operation consists of a network call to server through web service, the server then calls another server to connect to authority server, the authority server responds back with data in the same loop as requested. The authority takes time because it is having a very large database consists of about one billion records. So, to encrypt decrypt and authenticate operation takes about 510 seconds to process completely.p  pI can not perform the operation in one thread as for processing whole file may take months so I want to create hundreds of threads which will process the data.

When a thread returns data after process then it writes it in file and create new thread for new line to process.p  pThis approach Im thinking seems to be too complex, should I implement the same and how or how should I resolve the problem.p

The basic trick is to create a trivial base class i.e. no explicit function declarations, no data members, nothing and a templated derived class for storing codestdfunctionltgtcode objects with arbitrary signatures, then make the container hold codeuniqueptrcodes to objects of the base class. The code is also a hrefhttpsgithub.comwisoltechcpp11callbacksblobmastercallback4.cc relnofollowavailable on GitHub.ap  pI dont think this code can be made robust codestdfunctionltgtcode can be created from a lambda, which might include a capture, which might include a byvalue copy of a nontrivial object whose destructor must be called. When the codeFunctcode type is deleted by codeuniqueptrcode upon removal from the map, only its trivial destructor will be called, so the codestdfunctionltgtcode objects never get properly deleted.p  pIve replaced the usecase code from the example on GitHub with a nontrivial type that is then captured by value inside a lambda and added to the container. In the code below, the parts copied from the example are noted in comments everything else is mine. Theres probably a simpler demonstration of the problem, but Im struggling a bit to even get a valid compile out of this thing.p  precodeinclude ltmapgt include ltmemorygt include ltfunctionalgt include lttypeindexgt include ltiostreamgt   COPIED FROM httpsplus.google.comWisolChpostseDZMGb7PN6T namespace      The base type that is stored in the collection.   struct Funct     The map that stores the callbacks.   using callbackst  stdmapltstdtypeindex, stduniqueptrltFunctgtgt   callbackst callbacks     The derived type that represents a callback.   templatelttypename ...Agt     struct Cbt  public Funct        using cb  stdfunctionltvoidA...gt       cb callback       Cbtcb pcallback  callbackpcallback           Wrapper function to call the callback stored at the given index with the    passed argument.   templatelttypename ...Agt     void callstdtypeindex index, Aampamp ... args            using funct  CbtltA...gt       using cbt  stdfunctionltvoidA...gt       const Functamp base  callbacks[index]       const cbtamp fun  staticcastltconst functampgtbase.callback       funstdforwardltAgtargs...         end anonymous namespace   END COPIED CODE  class NontrivialType    public     NontrivialTypevoid            stdcout ltlt NontrivialTypevoid ltlt stdendl           NontrivialTypeconst NontrivialTypeamp            stdcout ltlt NontrivialTypeconst NontrivialTypeamp ltlt stdendl           NontrivialTypeNontrivialTypeampamp            stdcout ltlt NontrivialTypeNontrivialTypeampamp ltlt stdendl            NontrivialTypevoid            stdcout ltlt Calling the destructor for a NontrivialType ltlt stdendl           void printSomethingvoid const            stdcout ltlt Calling NontrivialTypeprintSomething ltlt stdendl         COPIED WITH MODIFICATIONS int main     Define our functions.   using func1  Cbtltgt    NontrivialType nt   stduniqueptrltfunc1gt f1  stdmakeuniqueltfunc1gt       [nt]void                nt.printSomething               Add to the map.   stdtypeindex index1typeidf1   callbacks.insertcallbackstvaluetypeindex1, stdmovef1     Call the callbacks.   callindex1    return 0  codepre  pThis produces the following output using G 5.1 with no optimizationp  precodeNontrivialTypevoid NontrivialTypeconst NontrivialTypeamp NontrivialTypeNontrivialTypeampamp NontrivialTypeNontrivialTypeampamp NontrivialTypeconst NontrivialTypeamp Calling the destructor for a NontrivialType Calling the destructor for a NontrivialType Calling the destructor for a NontrivialType Calling NontrivialTypeprintSomething Calling the destructor for a NontrivialType codepre  pI count five constructor calls and four destructor calls.

Im not sure if thats part of my problem.p  pWhen I manually run the for loop thats in watchSet and replace mathFunction with the function I intend to run, it does actually run the function I give it every time I edit the cells.

Negative 7436 pI am thinking about how to design a REST api for a tree like structure. I read already this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2150171howshouldaresturlschemalooklikeforatreehierarchyHow should a REST URL schema look like for a tree hierarchya and a lot of other resources, but still am on the fence between several possibilities.p  pThis is my tree root is artificial as it is only displayed for UI purposes, the datamodel has no root.p  pre  root  credit 10000 status gold   helpFast   callBack                               status silver   helpFast        node branch anothernode anotherbranch resultnode   ...  pre  pWhere strong strong is a node and  xxx is a condition on a branch, so the first line reads as If Credit  10000 and status  gold then helpFast and callBack.p  pFrom a very abstract point of view this consists of nodes and branches. So my first Idea is to have two resourcesp  ul litreetreenamenode with PUT, POST and DELETEli litreetreenamebranch with PUT, POST and DELETEli ul  pand one GET resourcep  ul litreetreenameli ul  pwhich returns the whole data as one.p  pThis is all we need for now.p  pHowever, you can see that we have nodes here with different meanings.p  pFirst there is a condition node credit with a condition branch 10000 which belongs together and then there is a result node a leaf basically that may contain many assignments and another special field that is unique to the assignment and does not exist in a condition.p  pSo another approach is to havep  ul litreenameconditionNode PUT, POST, DELETEli litreenamebranch PUT, POST, DELETEli litreenameleave PUT, POST, DELETEli litreenameresult PUT, POST, DELETE just as a convenience for the leaveli ul  pOr maybe use something completely different.p  pI find all solutions that I came up with having some disadvantages, so I am open for every idea and discussion points or considerations.p  pThanks, Svenp  pstrongEDITstrong When using the plain codenodecode, codebranchcode approach I would identify the transferred data by a codetypecode key value pair that would contain types like conditionNode, resultNode, result and may be some more. This could map to possible resources.p

TDMGCC gfortran is perhaps the closest I got, as I could run a DLL created from gfortran, but not in C. In fact, in TDMGCC gfortran, after I created a Fortran DLL that was referencing a C DLL, all function calls to the Fortran generated DLL within Excel VBA would immediately return 0, even after no warnings were given after compiling the Fortran DLL In other cases, it said it could not find the function name in the DLL, even though I made them without decorations or underscores. Excluding the C DLL from that build would eliminate that problem, but of course, I need to reference the C DLL as it has required 3rd party functions.p  pI looked at other posts and could not find an answer to this questionp  ul lipMy question is not a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22134259fortrandllimportimporting a Fortran DLL into c or Capli lipI do not get the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10381739runfortrandllwithvisualstudioAdd as Link option when right clicking AddExisting Itemapli lipThe answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1237129howtocallcsharpcodefromfortrandllthis posta did not solve my questionpli lipA similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23433508fortrancallingacdllwhichinturncallsanotherfortrandllherea was not answered adequatelypli ul  pPlease provide a stepbystep guide to getting Fortran to work with DLLIMPORT, with both gfortran and Intel Visual Studio Fortran, if possible.
