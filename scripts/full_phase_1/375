Positive 375 pI have a model codeNavigationcode that has a polymorphic codetargetcode. That codetargetcode can be a codePagecode, an codeExternalLinkcode, or a codePlugincode. Each of these targets has different attributes page has codecontentcode, codetitlecode, external link has codetitlecode, codeurlcode, plugin has its own polymorphic relations.p  pIm building a little form to add a Navigation link, and I want to give my users the option to select an existing one of these relations which is easy enough, just a grouped collection select, but I also would like to let them select a New option for each of these codetargetcode models.p  pThe question is  how do I include it in the same form p  pI could make a form object, but that feels like the lastresort option. I know I can accept nested attributes for codetargetcode, but I dont know how to do that with a selection form as well. I know I could do some js hackery to add or remove form elements on selecting or not selecting the new options.p  pAll of these dont feel railsey. This problem feels like a notuncommon issue, and I imagine this is a solved problem that Im trying to reinvent the wheel for. What option am I missing What is the rails way to make thisp
Positive 375 pNumpy has a sophisticated indexingslicingstepping functionality in its array access operator. See this a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocnumpyreferencearrays.indexing.htmlhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocnumpyreferencearrays.indexing.htmlap  pWhile experimenting with Haskell, I thought it would educational to try replicating a subset of this indexing functionality. Specifically its tuple selection objects or ndimensional projection a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiProjection28relationalalgebra29httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiProjection28relationalalgebra29a.p  pBasically you can dop  precodetwodarray[011, 042] codepre  pAnd this will give you the first row stepped by 1 containing the first 2 columns stepped by 2 skipping 1 column.p  pIn order words it can project an original 2 dimensional array into a smaller 2 dimensional array. The result remains as a 2 dimensional array.p  pSo heres what I tried in Haskell.p  pThe type of such a function should be something likep  precode  Functor f gt  f a gt [Int, Int, Int] gt f a codepre  pSo you could see something likep  precodethreedtensor  [s1,e1,st1, s2,e2,st2, s3,e3,st3] codepre  pWhere sx, ex, stx are start, end, step respectively.p  pThe example should project the original tensor into a smaller tensor, with the first dimension restricted by codes1 to e1, stepping by st1code, second dimension restricted by codes2 to e2, stepping by st2code... etc.p  pSo heres what I gotp  precodeslicing from to xs  take to  from  1 drop from xs  stepping n  map head . takeWhile not . null . iterate drop n   tensor start, end, steptail       project stepSlice start end step tensor tail map     where          project tensor start, end, steptail projection               project projection stepSlice start end step tensor tail projection . map         project tensor []                tensor         stepSlice start end step tensor               stepping step . slicing start end tensor codepre  pThe above does not work due to a problem of polymorphic recursion. Basically I cannot infinitely compose the codemapcode function, the specific expression that does this is the codeprojection . mapcode. If this kind of polymorphic recursion were possible, I believe it would work.

Positive 375 pIs it possible to force the implementation of an interface in C without modifying the source file of the class thats gonna be implementing it For example, suppose I include the source files for my class, but I dont wanna touch its source code, I just want this class to implement an interface I created in the code that included it.p  pGeneralizing even more, is it possible to do it with a binary library, where I dont even know the source code p  pThe reason Im doing this is that I want to import classes to my projects but want them to be untouched so people can use them in other codes just by copying the files from my project.

Positive 375 pWhile the main principle of polymorphism is decoupling what from who in term of codetypescode, but what confuses me how does methodcall mechanism finds out and calls the correct method body in polymorphism.p  pSince in java all method binding is codelatebindingcode unless the method is codestaticcode, codefinalcode or codeprivatecode, and latebinding is done by JVM which precomputes codemethod tablecode for each class and then do a table look up during runtime in normal method call.p  pBut the same thing happens during polymorphism too.

Whats happening herep  pIts perfectly working when not using any protocolp  precodeclass A      func test          printjello        class B A      override func test          printhello        let b A  B  prints hello b.test  codepre  pWhats different from adopting a protocol that adds new methods to my parent class and providing a new implementation in a subclass, than having directly written this method in the parent class and then overriding it in a subclassp  pDo you guys have any workaroundp
Positive 375 pI have to implement basically the same function but for different size.

Positive 375 pI am trying to create a class factory that uses a list of class types, calls overridden methods to find the class that matches the criteria, and then returns an instance of the matched class.  I am currently doing it with a list of class instances, which is ok, but using types would seem cleaner.  Otherwise we need to reinitialize the instance every time we actually use the class to clean up the internal working variables.

Positive 375 pI am having a wicked problem with exposing a polymorphic class hierarchy via a factory. I have created an example that demonstrates the problem. p  pThis is all being hosted in a executable with an embedded pythonstackless 2.7 interpreter. When I run the executable and get the Python code I can create a variable from the factory a  MakeB this returns a smart pointer to the TestA class but holds an instance of TestB. The problem I have is that when I access the base class member variablesfunctions it works, but accessing TestB variablesfunctions generates a segment fault 11 osx. p  pThe returned instance reports to python that its class is TestB strongclassstrong reports the same and the print messages show that TestB was constructed and returned. Of note that it I create TestB directly opposed to the factory the base classs variablesfunctions work correctly. p  pMy actual production code is more complex, but this has boiled it down to this test example. I can provide a backtrace of the segfault if anyone thinks it will help. p  pThanks. p  precodegtprint sys.version 2.7.6a1 Stackless 3.1b3 060516 default, Jan 10 2014, 131351  [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 clang500.2.79] codepre  phpp Filep  precodeclass TestA typedef boostsharedptrltTestAgt TestAPtr class TestB typedef boostsharedptrltTestBgt TestBPtr class TestA  public      TestA     virtual TestA     static void Boostvoid     string Aprop     void FuncA    class TestB  public TestA  public      TestB     virtual TestB     static void Boostvoid     string Bprop     void FuncB  codepre  pcpp Filep  precodeTestATestA  ApropTest A      printfCreate TestAn  TestATestA      printfDestroy TestAn  void TestABoostvoid      classlt TestA gtTestA, initltgt         .defFuncA, ampTestAFuncA         .defreadwriteAprop, ampTestAAprop              registerptrtopythonlt boostsharedptrltTestAgt gt  void TestAFuncA      printfHi From Test An      Test B  TestBTestB  TestA, BpropTest B      printfCreate TestBn   TestBTestB      printfDestroy TestBn  void TestBBoostvoid      classlt TestB, basesltTestAgt gtTestB, initltgt     .defFuncB, ampTestBFuncB     .defreadwriteBprop, ampTestBBprop              registerptrtopythonlt boostsharedptrltTestBgt gt  void TestBFuncB      printfHi From Test Bn    Factory...

Negative 375 pIm working with a database that has the limit that the strongonly numeric datatypestrong it can store is a strongdoublestrong. What I want to do is pick the number for a certain row and put it into an HTTP request. The problem revolves around that I cannot know if this number should or should not have decimals.p  pFor example, if the double is an ID, I cannot have any kind of formatting whatsoever, since the site that gets the strongHTTP requeststrong will be confused. Observe the following examplesp  precodesite.comshowid.phpid12300000  OK site.comshowid.phpid1.23E7  Bad scientific notation site.comshowid.phpid12300000.0  Bad trailing decimal codepre  pThe solution to this would be to strongcast it to a longstrong. Ignoring the problem of overflowing the long, it solves the scientific notation and obviously trailing decimal. This could be an acceptable solution but it would be nice if the code didnt assume it were IDs we were dealing with. What if, for example, I were to query a site that shows a map and the number are coordinates, strongwhere the decimals are very importantstrong Then a cast to long is no  longer acceptable.p  pIn short p  ul liIf the double has no decimals, do not add a trailing decimal. li liIf it has decimals, keep them all. li liNeither case should have scientific notation or thousand separators.li ul  pThis solution will be ported to both C and Java so I accept answers in both languages. Oh, and I had no idea what to call this question, feel free to rename if you got something better. p

Negative 375 pConsider the following 2 scenarios Scenario 1. Today is May 1st 2012, and Scenario 2. Today is September 1st 2012.p  pNow, consider that we write on our webpage the following about a comment someone has left This comment was written 3 months and 12 days ago. The amount of days in both these scenarios will ALWAYS be different even though the statement is exactly the same. In Scenario 1, 3 months and 12 days would equal code102 dayscode. However, in Scenario 2, 3 months and 12 days would be code104 dayscodep  pNow, to corner in on my point, lets use a different example and say that someone left a comment on our site on Jan 30th 2013, and today is March 10th 2013. Our real TimeSpan object needs to know this relative date, and can figure out the followingp  ul liThat there is 10 days in March,li liThat there is 1 day in Jan counting from 30th to 31st.li liThat the month Feb is one month regardless of how many days there are in it even though its 28 days.li ul  pSo, it would mean 10 days  1 day  1 month total, translating to codeThis comment was posted 1 Month and 11 Days agocode.p  pNow, if you used the MS style TimeSpan object or any TimeSpan object in any language, it would give you the number of days from 30th Jan to 10 March 39 days, and because the TimeSpan object doesnt store relative date the baseinitial date we subtracted to get the TimeSpan, if you asked it how many months and days it has been, it will assume there is 30 days in one month, or even worst, the average which is greater than 30 days, and return the rest in days, so to get to 39 days, it will tell you its been 1 Month and 9 Days and you will get the codeThis comment was posted 1 Month and 9 Days agocode message. Remember, both these scenarios have the same start date and same currentend date, yes the Microsoft TimeSpan object, by not allowing us to tell it the month of Feb 2013 should be considered, has given us a completely different TimeSpan, off by a whole 2 days. It has, in effect, lied to us.p  pThe problem is, people will believe this, and who knows what perceptions they may have, how their perceptions of the past may change and the decisions amp life choices they may make when trying to reconstruct events within the past inside their own minds, while never noticing or understanding the drawback and inherent failure of representing time that is so pervasive everywhere today. They will not understand that programming languages dont realize or care that last month had 31 days in it, as oppposed to 30, 29 or 28  or visa versa, and that this adds up when you increase the TimeSpan.p  pThis is the problem at the heart of this post. I understand that most people will not care about this difference but be sure that some of us do, and cannot have this on our backs, and if this doesnt bother you, thats ok. I wish it didnt bother me, I would have saved myself some time, stress and disappointment. If this is not a bother, you can use the function for the efficient textual display of relative time customizable to 1 to 6 nodes from seconds to years, instead of using it for the usually negligible accuracy it provides.p  pTo my disappointment I noticed that there is no real timespan object, if you get a timespan, and do a code.yearscode or code.monthscode youll get nothing, youll only get code.dayscode and lower because a timeSpan object doesnt carry anything to tell it which month or year the timeSpan was created on. Therefore itll never really know how many months its been since days in each month vary over a year and even further over a leap year.p  pIn response to this, Ill post a function I developed in order to get ACCURATE readings and be able to return things like the following on my ASP.NET web page...p  blockquote   pPosted 4 years, 3 months, 14 days, 15 hours, 18 minutes and 24 seconds agop blockquote  pI figured thered be a hellipp  pcodetimeSpan.GetActualNumberOf[MonthsDaysHoursetc]code base date must be provided of coursep  phellip type method on this datatype, but there wasnt.p  pAll youd really have to do is create another property on the timeSpan object to give it a base date on which the difference was calculated, then the above lovely string would be calculable pretty easily, and a code.yearcode amp code.monthcode would existp  pUPDATE I have significantly expanded upon and updated my official answer and code usage details in my answer below, 100 working answer and code in full, accurate and exact relative timedates, no approximations  thanks.p

Negative 375 pI know that discussions about coding styles tend to end in disaster and endless flame wars, but thats not what I want to reach. During the last decade I mainly saw two different coding styles for codedealloccode methods in ObjectiveC. The first and most common one was to place codedealloccode at the bottom of the file. This is also the style Apple uses in the Xcode default templates. The logic behind this seems to be that codedealloccode is invoked when the end of the object approaches, so the end of the file seems to be a nice metaphor.p  pOn the other hand a couple of people tend to put codedealloccode directly below the codesynthesizecode directives. This has two major disadvantages in my opinionp  ol liThe top of the file gets cluttered with emboring codeem.li liIts harder to find the essential parts in your class, you have to scroll down.li ol  pThe huge advantage in my opinion is that you have a direct visual connection between properties and the corresponding codereleasecode message.p  pThe other thing is niling already released variables. While I dont think that this is necessary, especially in object context where the whole variable gets desctructed after codedealloccode ends, I tend to also nil the variables. Im used to do this for variables in function scope, so Im just consistent with my coding style.p  pThis is how most of my classes look likep  precodeimplementation Bar  synthesize foo   voiddealloc    [foo release], foo  nil    [super dealloc]    Initializers and other methods codepre  pI already mentioned a couple of pros and cons. What do you think about this topic What is the coding style you use in codedealloccode and emwhyem Are there other pros and cons I forgot to mentionp  pI dont want to start a flame war here. I just want to know what style you use and if you have specific reasons for this or if this doesnt matter for you in the end.p

I was surprised to find that doing this took my run time down to about 6 minutes consistently.  Although it does improve the performance it looks a little hackish, and Im curious if there is something built into SQL Server that will accomplish this.  p  ul liIs doing this to improve the performance of your queries unheard of   li liAm i even right to assume that the improvement in time that I saw was a result of a Primed cacheli ul  pIf my understanding of Caching is a bit off please feel free to share any links or info you think might be helpful.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Well Im embarrassed to say that I tried to reproduce this behavior today, but was unable to.  I spoke with some people at my work and it looks like some of the stuff they were doing on the DB yesterday may have made it appear as if my select before the proc was improving performance when in fact it wasnt.  Id still be interested to hear if anyone knows if priming the cache is possible through.p

Negative 375 pLets say I have two tables in SQL that I want to have an EDMX model generated from for now, going with automagical generation for everything using POCO T4 templates. Lets say our two tables are codePerson ID, FName, LNamecode and codeComment ID, PersonID, CommentText, CommentDatecode with a onetomany relation between the two i.e. you can make many comments about one person.p  pGetting my POCO entities generated from this is trivial and works beautifully. What I dont know how to do now, though, is to add a custom navigation property on my codePersoncode entity that represents the most recent comment for that person eventually something even more complex than this will ultimately be needed. For now, its okay that its readonly but it would be nice to know how to handle an writable property too.p  pWhat is the proper way to do this One thing to consider is that Im serializing these entities so I will need them to be eagerloaded and persisted in a way that I can push them out to my UI with WCF in the middle i.e. a custom handwritten property in an extension class that relies on lazy loading is not an option.p  pIve gotten pretty good at using EF4 for standard stuff, but now that Im getting into this custom stuff, Im not entirely sure how to do this in a best practice way.p

Negative 375 pI have been coding an app in classic ASP that accesses 2 Access databases.  I had a page I was working on throw an exception, which is normal during development and causes no lasting problems.

Negative 375 pToday I had an epiphany, and it was that I was doing everything wrong. Some history I inherited a C application, which was really just a collection of static methods, a completely procedural mess of C code. I refactored this the best I knew at the time, bringing in lots of postcollege OOP knowledge. To make a long story short, many of the entities in code have turned out to be Singletons.p  pToday I realized I needed 3 new classes, which would each follow the same Singleton pattern to match the rest of the software. If I keep tumbling down this slippery slope, eventually every class in my application will be Singleton, which will really be no logically different from the original group of static methods.p  pI need help on rethinking this. I know about Dependency Injection, and that would generally be the strategy to use in breaking the Singleton curse. However, I have a few specific questions related to this refactoring, and all about best practices for doing so.p  ol lipHow acceptable is the use of static variables to encapsulate configuration information I have a brain block on using static, and I think it is due to an early OO class in college where the professor said static was bad. But, should I have to reconfigure the class every time I access it When accessing hardware, is it ok to leave a static pointer to the addresses and variables needed, or should I continually perform codeOpencode and codeClosecode operationspli lipRight now I have a single method acting as the controller. Specifically, I continually poll several external instruments via hardware drivers for data. Should this type of controller be the way to go, or should I spawn separate threads for each instrument at the programs startup If the latter, how do I make this object oriented Should I create classes called codeInstrumentAListenercode and codeInstrumentBListenercode Or is there some standard way to approach thispli lipIs there a better way to do global configuration Right now I simply have codeConfiguration.Instance.Foocode sprinkled liberally throughout the code. Almost every class uses it, so perhaps keeping it as a Singleton makes sense. Any thoughtspli lipA lot of my classes are things like codeSerialPortWritercode or codeDataFileWritercode, which must sit around waiting for this data to stream in. Since they are active the entire time, how should I arrange these in order to listen for the events generated when data comes inpli ol  pAny other resources, books, or comments about how to get away from Singletons and other pattern overuse would be helpful.p

Negative 375 pGreetings.p  pI am studying the way mpeg layerIII encoding works for an upcoming project. I downloaded the shine encoder as it is said to be the simpliest of all. a hrefhttpwww.mp3tech.orgprogrammersourcesshine.zip relnofollowhttpwww.mp3tech.orgprogrammersourcesshine.zipa is the link.p  pMy current step that i FAIL at is to compile the source codes i downloaded.p  pI never before worked on a lower levels of programming or compiling, to say, i mostly worked in GUIs and just made projects, designed forms, written code... I do understand basically how compiling and linking works but i never did it from command line or anything. Also i cannot say i am very skilled with cc as i developed for Borland Delphi and then went straight to .NET with C. I assume that since files are called .h and .c they are C, not C files. p  pI was told to use QT Creator since the upcoming project will have to run on Linux as well, and our company uses QT for making Linux apps.p  pI did create a blank QT creator console application project, but unlike c, this console appicaton contains event loop . Anyways, what i did is removed main.cpp and added all shine project files. I made main.c file the first one in SOURCES list so compiling starts with it.p  pNow, the compiler tells me this common error p  precodeexpected , ,, , asm or attribute before codepre  pfor example, at linesp  precodebool  waveopen  codepre  pat wave.hp  pandp  precodestatic bool parsecommandint argc, char argv  codepre  pat main.cp  pI didnt find any description of this error, all cases of its discussion on the webs lead to persons finding typos in another files that leads to the error forgetting a letter or  before endif in previous header file. I dont understand what is this error about as for example, addingp  precodeint i codepre  pbefore the error still makes compiler spit this same error again.p  pCould someone please suggest what do i need to do to actually compile the code under QT Creator p

Negative 375 pI have been following some examples of RIA services and although a great concept, i am locked into using a WCF Service not RIA as it is also used by other clients like WPF, and asp.net.p  pTHe good thing about RIA was that the ASYNC calling of the service was hidden but with WCF i presume this is not the case so how is it possible to call a WCF Service from silverlight. Add service Reference and then i presume i have to call and wait for a callbackp  pAny tutorials on thisp  pThis is a real shame for me as i would have liked to use RIA services.p  pThe other doubt i have that comes to mind is the use of Entity models and data annotations. In ria this was really easy, but if i am using standard wcf services then i presume that the entity classes actually i am using ENtity framework will arrive on the client silverlight because i do Add Service Reference Am i correct herep  pWIth Data annotations, ria automatically sent the entity classes with the data annotations from the server ria to the client silverlight  but what is the case with standard WCF services.p  pSo currently i believe that i need a silverlight clietn app and NO ria services but i basically would call to wcf services. p  pThe question that arrises now is should i use a mix of RIA and WCF services silverlight calls RIA and then RIA calls WCF Service...p  pI would really apprecaite any feedback as i am a little lost of the right direction to take...

Negative 375 pI am trying to figure out how to implement the following scenario. I have multiple project sites with the same structure the structure contains subsites and libraries. I want to tag each document with a projectnumber eg 100050BCD. How can i set this as default for each subsite in the site collection, so the user does not have to fill in the number over and over again. p  pMy first approach was to create a contenttype contract on site collection level which contains the site columns Title, Description, Projectnumber etc  but i cannot set a value for each subsite. Right So i think this could not work.p  pwith the second approach i would use managed metadata. I would create a column on the subsite level called projectnumber with a default value from the managed metadata store. So in the metadata store I create the projectnumbers and set this as default in the subsite column type. This column is added in the libraries in the subsite. I then should be able to use the metadata as refinement in my searchresults, or not The ugly part in it is that i have different column types projectnumber for each subsite, that feels not quite right.p  pThe question is am i using the right approach or should i use another one and could this be done much easier p
Negative 375 pAre there any established patterns for checking class invariants in Cp  pIdeally, the invariants would be automatically checked at the beginning and at the end of each public member function. As far as I know, C with classes provided special codebeforecode and codeaftercode member functions, but unfortunately, design by contract wasnt quite popular at the time and nobody except Bjarne used that feature, so he removed it.p  pOf course, manually inserting codecheckinvariantscode calls at the beginning and at the end of each public member function is tedious and errorprone. Since RAII is the weapon of choice to deal with exceptions, I came up with the following scheme of defining an invariance checker as the first local variable, and that invariance checker checks the invariants both at construction and destruction timep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class invariantschecker      const T p  public      invariantscheckerconst T p  pp              pgtcheckinvariants           invariantschecker              pgtcheckinvariants        void Foobar       class invariants checked by construction of      invariantscheckerltFoogt this       ... mutate the object       class invariants checked by destruction of   codepre  pQuestion 0 I suppose there is no way to declare an unnamed local variable p  pWe would still have to call codecheckinvariantscode manually at the end of the codeFoocode constructor and at the beginning of the codeFoocode destructor. However, many constructor bodies and destructor bodies are empty. In that case, could we use an codeinvariantscheckercode as the last memberp  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltstdexceptgt  class Foo      stdstring str     stdstringsizetype cachedlength     invariantscheckerltFoogt   public      Fooconst stdstringamp str      strstr, cachedlengthstr.length, this       void checkinvariants const              if str.length  cachedlength             throw stdlogicerrorwrong cached length            ...  codepre  pQuestion 1 Is it valid to pass codethiscode to the codeinvariantscheckercode constructor which immediately calls codecheckinvariantscode via that pointer, even though the codeFoocode object is still under constructionp  pQuestion 2 Do you see any other problems with this approach Can you improve itp  pQuestion 3 Is this approach new or wellknown Are there better solutions availablep

I would then create a codeviewControllercode which on codeloadViewcode loads codelabelViewcode then when user double taps the codelabelViewcode i get an event in codelabelViewcode class which is sent to my codeviewControllercode that then can unload codeloadViewcode and load the codepickerViewcode.p  pDoes this sound as the best way to do this  Is there a simpler way  I am also unsure how i route the event from the codelabelViewcode class to the codeviewControllercodeclass.p

Negative 375 pI am writing a network kernel extension for socket filtering. To make it configurable, a userland program reads a config file and passes the information to the kext through a codePFSYSTEMcode socket.p  pIf I want to have the socket filter up and running as soon as possible at system startup, how would I choreograph the launchp  pMy current idea is to use launchd to start a small userland initializer program. This program would use codekextloadcode to start the kext. After that, it would read the config file and talk to the kext through the codePFSYSTEMcode socket. Having done its job, it would then quickly exit.p  pAnother option would be to have two codelaunchdcode items, one for the kext using codekextloadcode and another for the userland configuration file reader. This would avoid the fork, but would otherwise be identical. Either way, codelaunchdcode would have to run a quick nondaemon userland program.p  pHowever, codelaunchdcode seems to be geared towards launching actual daemons, not for quick tasks that do their work and exit. The a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationMacOSXConceptualBPSystemStartupArticlesLaunchOnDemandDaemons.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40001762104142 relnofollowdeveloper library documenta saysp  blockquote   pstrongImportantstrong If your daemon shuts down too quickly after being launched, launchd may think it has crashed. Daemons that continue this behavior may be suspended and not launched again when future requests arrive. To avoid this behavior, do not shut down for at least 10 seconds after launch. p blockquote  pThis gives me the impression that codelaunchdcode is not the correct way to do this. How should I organize the launch Is my whole idea going in the wrong directionp  pAs a side note, I want to give the user the possibility to alter the filtering options during runtime too. I imagine this can be done simply by opening a new PFSYSTEM socket connection to the kext whenever changes are needed.p

Negative 375 pI would like to know if binding a control in Silverlight, to linq expression is same as binding to an observable collection  I have a treeview which as of now Im binding to an observable collection. Then I learned about linq expressions and it seemed by using the linq query i can totally get rid of this collection and generate it using the query but im not sure if this generated result from the linq query will get updated on the fly and pass the updates to the UI p  pfor example i have a list of employees, i created an observable collection of employees who were managers and used that as the itemsource for the tree. Whenever new employees were added and if they were managers they would get added to the manager collection and the tree would update. Now using linq i can generate a list of employees who are managers using a query but i dont have means to test if this will also get updated when new employees who are managers are added to the employees collection.p  precodeclass EmployeeCollection  IEnumerableltEmployeegt, INotifyCollectionChanged   private ListltEmployeegt empColl  private ObservableCollectionltEmployeegt managerCollection  Not needed now   managerTreeView.ItemsSource  from Employee in EmployeeCollection where Employee.isManager select Employee codepre  pThanksp

Negative 375 pIm trying to find a method to iterate over an a pack variadic template argument list. Now as with all iterations, you need some sort of method of knowing how many arguments are in the packed list, and more importantly how to individually get data from a packed argument list.p  pThe general idea is to iterate over the list, store all data of type int into a vector, store all data of type char into a vector, and store all data of type float, into a vector. During this process there also needs to be a seperate vector that stores individual chars of what order the arguments went in.  As an example, when you pushbackafloat, youre also doing a pushbackf which is simply storing an individual char to know the order of the data.  I could also use a stdstring here and simply use .  The vector was just used as an example.p  pNow the way the thing is designed is the function itself is constructed using a macro, despite the evil intentions, its required, as this is an experiment.  So its literally impossible to use a recursive call, since the actual implementation that will house all this will be expanded at compile time and you cannot recruse a macro.p  pDespite all possible attempts, Im still stuck at figuring out how to actually do this.  So instead Im using a more convoluted method that involves constructing a type, and passing that type into the varadic template, expanding it inside a vector and then simply iterating that.

Its purely an idea.  It could probably be done a better way.  But an example of how you would use this systemp  precodedeffoo   int data  get0, int   stdcout ltlt data ltlt stdendl end codepre  plooks a lot like python. it works too, but the only problem is how you call this function. Heres a quick examplep  precodefooarg1000 codepre  pIm required to construct a new any type, which is highly aesthetic, but thats not to say those macros are not either.  Aside the point, I just want to the option of doing     foo1000p  pI know it can be done, I just need some sort of iteration method, or more importantly some stdget method for packed variadic template argument lists.  Which Im sure can be done.p  pAlso to note, Im well aware that this is not exactly type friendly, as Im only supporting int,float,char and thats okay with me.  Im not requiring anything else, and Ill add checks to use typetraits to validate that the arguments passed are indeed the correct ones to produce a compile time error if data is incorrect.  This is purely not an issue.  I also dont need support for anything other then these POD types.p  pIt would be highly apprecaited if I could get some constructive help, opposed to arguments about my purely illogical and stupid use of macros and POD only types.  Im well aware of how fragile and broken the code is.  This is merley an experiment, and I can later rectify issues with nonPOD data, and make it more typesafe and useable.p  pThanks for your undertstanding, and Im looking forward to help.p

Negative 375 pIm investigating a problem with a utility weve developed.  We track a file or a directory and when a change has been made we upload the new version to a central repository.  Our utility is similar to dropbox in that you can track changes, but its a lot more of a version tracker than a sync utility.p  pWe can detect when a file has been changed.  But wed like to be able to detect whether the process that made the change is still using it ... for lack of a better term. p  pThe problem occurs when a user has a file open in some program and periodically hits Save.  Or, worst yet, an autosave feature saves the workinprogress every couple minutes.  We want to be able to detect this and only save as needed, such as when the user finally saves and closes a file.  If a program with an autosave is open all night long we end up with hundreds of useless versions of the same file.p  ol liIs it possible to detect what process saved a fileli liIs it possible to detect if that process is still using that file.li ol  pThis was straightforward in Windows but is proving extremely complicated in Mac.

Negative 375 pIve looked in the BBEdit forums, the RVM documentation and on Stack Overflow  with no joy, so hopefully someone can answer what I hope is a fairly simple question.p  pLast night I left behind my system Ruby 1.9.2 and installed RVM Im on Mac OSX Lion.  I am now using the RVM Ruby 1.9.3 on my system as default and everything works fine in the Terminal.  However, I use BBEdit to code and want it to use the same RVM Ruby when I hit CommandR to run scripts.  Unlike in Textmate, there doesnt seem to be an obvious way to set the PATH to a Ruby installation in BBEdit.  Following a related query to the BBEdit support people, I created a .plist file at .MacOSXenvironment.plist and tried to set the PATH in there, but it doesnt work. Im not at home at the moment so if anyone needs to see that .plist file, I can post it later.p

After that, Ill explain the task in English, SQL and inefficient Django ORM.emp  h2The Modelh2  pIn my CMS model, posts are multilanguage For each post and each language, there can be one instance of the posts content. Also, when editing posts, I dont codeUPDATEcode, but codeINSERTcode new versions of them.p  pSo, codePostContentcode is unique on codepostcode, codelanguagecode and codeversioncode. Heres the classp  precodeclass PostContentmodels.Model      contains all versions of a post, in all languages.      language  models.ForeignKeyLanguage     post  models.ForeignKeyPost            the Post object itself only     version  models.IntegerFielddefault0  contains slug and id.      further metadata and content left out      class Meta         uniquetogether  resource, language, version, codepre  h2The Task in SQLh2  pAnd this is the task strongId like to get a list of the most recent versions of all posts in each language, using the ORM.strong In SQL, this translates to a codeJOINcode on a subquery that does codeGROUP BYcode and codeMAXcode to get the maximum of codeversioncode for each unique pair of coderesourcecode and codelanguagecode. The perfect answer to this question would be a number of ORM calls that produce the following SQL statementp  precodeSELECT     id,      postid,      version,     v FROM     cmspostcontent,       SELECT          postid as p,          maxversion as v,          languageid as l      FROM          cmspostcontent      GROUP BY          postid,          languageid      as maxv WHERE      postidp      AND versionv      AND languageidl codepre  h2Solution in Djangoh2  pMy current solution using the Django ORM does not produce such a JOIN, but two seperate SQL queries, and one of those queries can become very large. I first execute the subquery the inner codeSELECTcode from abovep  precodemaxv  PostContent.objects.valuespost,language.annotate   maxversionMaxversion codepre  pNow, instead of joining codemaxvcode, I explicitly ask for every single post in codemaxvcode, by  filtering codePostContent.objects.allcode for each tuple of codepost, language, maxversioncode. The resulting SQL looks likep  precodeSELECT  FROM PostContent WHERE         postP1 and languageL1 and versionV1      OR postP2 and languageL2 and versionV2     OR ... codepre  pIn Djangop  precodefrom django.db.models import Q conjunc  maplambda pc Qversionpc[maxversion].and   Qpostpc[post].and   Qlanguagepc[language], maxv result  PostContent.objects.filter   reducelambda disjunc, x disjunc.orx, conjunc[1], conjunc[0] codepre  pIf codemaxvcode is sufficiently small, e.g. when retrieving a single post, this might be a good solution, but the size of the query and the time to create it grow linearly with  the number of posts. The complexity of parsing the query is also at least linear.p  pIs there a better way to do this, apart from using raw SQLp

What i want to achieve is the followingp  pI have a Facebook Page that represents a product. I cant get in to specifics of what it is but i can present a made up scenario that relates to my problem. Lets say that product was a restaurant and i have a web page for it. So i want to link my Facebook pagefor that restaurant and the web page i crated. On my web page i have the following functionality. Every week one of my services picks 5 menus and makes them promotional and displays them on the home page. Now i want those 5 menus to be posted on the Facebook page i created for the restaurant automatically. Meaning no one will administer this posting it will be done by the web application it self. Because is automated i dont want to prompt anyone to log in to Facebook every time this happens.p  pFirst of all can this be achieved or there are some restriction from facebook that disallow this action.p  pIf yes can someone point me to an example in Java where this is done. p  pSo far i created an app on Facebook so that up has a page for it self. But when i did the actions i pointed out in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9874914postingappgeneratedcommentsonfacebookpageusingjavaPosting appgenerated comments on Facebook page using Javaa the post was not displayed. I managed to post from my app to my profile saying that the post was done through my app but this is not what i am looking for. p  pIf all of this can be achived, can it be done with RestFb as an API p

Ive done some testing on class load times and they dont really seem to be affected all that much.  p  pAnother reason I want to move the dependencies into the jars manifest is that with so many files the command line gets long and hard to read.

Negative 375 pIm developing a site for a client that has 3 themes available. Im using the appthemes system to enable the user to change the style.

If this isnt an option Ive considered writing a ScriptLoader JavaScript that will inspect the style sheet tags to determine which theme is being used. It would be better if I could just add the theme name as a class attribute on the body element and just look at that and pull in appropriate scripts.   p
Negative 375 pAnd maybe the first question is is it useful or possible to get a graphics context cached on the GPU On iPad 1, 2, and the New iPad, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPowervr relnofollowPowerVRa is used as the GPU, and does it use the RAM as graphics memory  If so, can it and does it help if we get a graphics context cached on the GPUp  pIf in fact it can, then how would we get such a graphics context  There are mentioning of codeCGLayercode and codeCALayercode codeCGLayercode can be cached on GPU, and codeCALayercode is often cached on the GPU, but codeCGLayercode is obtained from another context, using codeCGLayerCreateWithContextcode, and that context supposedly should be a Window graphics context and it is only mentioned for a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationGraphicsImagingConceptualdrawingwithquartz2ddqcontextdqcontext.htmlapplerefdocuidTP30001066CH203CJBDCHAC relnofollowhow to get a Window Graphics Context on Mac OS Xa, not iOS.

Negative 375 pIm using a standard SQL database and Im trying to figure out whether or not to flatten a table or make it more objectoriented.

These tables arent high access tables, they wouldnt have tons of queries per minute or even hundreds of rows in them, so I dont think efficiency would be much of an issue.p  pSo mainly what Im wondering is would this be a generally accepted design or should you generally keep your table structures flat p

If needed, Open Call Hierarchy shows the sequence of methods as they called one by one. p  pThis approach gives following advantagesp  ul liI can start typing new method without thinking where to place it in the code, because after save it will be placed by Eclipse to appropriate place automatically.li liI always find public methods in the upper part of the code dont have to search the whole class for themli ul  pHowever there are some disadvantagesp  pWhen refactoring large method into smaller ones Im not very satisfied that new private methods are placed in different parts of code and therefore its little bit hard to follow the code concept.

Negative 375 pI am working on a large R project to perform different analyses of a common dataset.  I have built up several individual scripts for each analysis, as well as highlevel scripts to call each one in sequence.  Each script starts by calling an codeinit.Rcode script that wipes the memory  codermlistlsallTRUEcode .p  pI have recently discovered that codesummarycode and, I think codecoefcode produces different output, depending on the order of the scripts.  In scripts that fit models using codelmcode or codegamcode codemgcvcode package, if these are run first, in a fresh R session, the codesummarycode output lists factors with the full labels.p  pHowever, if I run other scripts first, which use simple nested codeaovcode functions and produce some graphs and other output using some other packages, then rerun the previouslymentioned scripts, codesummarycode instead produces output with factor levels labeled using numbers the coded values, not the actual factor level labels.p  pThis is not something I can easily reproduce using a minimal working example, unfortunately, because I havent quite pinpointed where in my scripts this behaviour changes.  I have confirmed a few things in quick testsp  ul limemory is cleared in between scripts using codermlistlscode, so there shouldnt be anything in memory causing this change.li licodesummarycode itself does not change the modelfitting functions actually produce slightly different output as confirmed with codeall.equalcode , which is even more disturbing.  Saved objects produced when running the scripts in a different order reliably produce the same output whenever they are loaded, but that output differs depending on the order of scripts used to generate the fitted model objects even though memory is cleared in between each script. ul liDepending on the order of scripts, codesummary lm... code also outputs different estimates for model terms, but the same Residuals summary, R2, and overall Ftest.  Very bizarre.li ulli liI can not recover the default desired behaviour by removing packages loaded in prior scripts.  Does the order of loading packages matterli lidefault behaviour is restored after quitting and restarting R ul linothing in this answer seemed to fix the problem  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3716764resetrinstanceReset R instanceali ulli ul  pIdeally, I would like my project to be able to reproduce all results and output by simply codesourcecodeing each script in turn, but this strange bug in my code  Im not blaming this on R means that the output is not consistent and depends on the order p  pIs there anything other than objects or packages that stays in memory that could alter the way modelfitting functions work, or store factor levels in dataframes that are passed inp  h2EDITh2  pI realized the answer to the above question was the contrasts option see below.

Negative 375 pThis is in the context of the Microsoft C Concurrency API.p  pTheres a class called codeagentcode under codeConcurrencycode namespace, and its basically a state machine you derive and implement pure virtual codeagentruncode.p  pNow, it is your responsibility to call codeagentstartcode, which will put it in a emrunnableem state. You then call codeagentwaitcode, or any of its variants, to actually execute the codeagentruncode method.p  pBut why do we have to call codeagentdonecode within the body I mean, the obvious answer is that codeagentwaitcode will wait until done is signaled or the timeout has elapsed, but...p  pWhat were the designers intending Why not have the agent enter the done state when codeagentruncode returns Thats what I want to know. Why do I have the option to not call codedonecode The wait methods throw exceptions if the timeout has elapsed.p

Negative 375 pIm in charge of developing an inhouse enterprise app for the company Im working for. Ive hit a huge roadblock that I cant figure out.p  pThe app uses audio units, I have 3 iPhonesp  precode3gs  iOS 5.1.1 4  iOS 5.1.1 5  iOS 6 codepre  pusing a provisioning profile I can run a test build on these devices and everything works fine, using my own developer account and an ad hoc profile, they all work fine. Build it for wireless distribution with enterprise and all the iOS 5.1.1 devices dont work.p  pThere is no install issue, the apps load correctly but the audio units  a circular buffer I made go to hell. It seems like Im getting massive buffer overrun, but I cant figure why, its only with the enterprise account that this happens. Im getting all the correct data, the data is feeding into the audio correctly and if I increase the circular buffer size very high I can here the correct audio for a very short time and then it goes hazy and will come back briefly and go hazy again.p  pIm wondering if anybody knows any of the underlying differences between a testing build and an enterprise build. Is it possible there are some best practices that Im not following, as I cant understand why Im seeing such huge differences between the two.p  pNote Only settings change Im making between the 2 builds is code signing, nothing elsep

Negative 375 pI understand that with a writeheavy application, using the ObjectId is a really bad idea for a sharding key. strongHowever, would it be a good idea to use native UUID.randomUUID from Javastrong as a Shard key since they are truly random and wont cause hotspotting for a single shard.p  pThese IDs are strong128 bit IDstrong and look like  p  ul li5842fa92557947f1b020041ff74868a4li li308947443e564d80b97dd8411b4b727e li lif8a7ee765bed4ce3bcc5800ac3a2a710   li li1bcfd08b89e94c58ae7695b3e7a1bc4fli ul  pIts very similar to an ObjectId 96bit int.p  pPlus, since this is mandatory to have an Index on the id, the shard key would be the id and we would save RAM by creating another index for the shardkey. Everything collection would be ready for sharding.p  pIs it for performances issues within strongMongodstrong or for diskram space problemp  pThe collision rate for a UUID is a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUniversallyuniqueidentifierRandomUUIDprobabilityofduplicates relnofollowfrom wikipediaa   emonly after generating 1 billion UUIDs every second for the next 100 years, the probability of creating just one duplicate would be about 50.

Negative 375 pI compared the performance of the inbuilt R functions codernormcode, codeqnormcode and codepnormcode to the equivalent Matlab functions.p  pIt seems as if the codernormcode and codepnormcode functions are 36 times slower in R than in Matlab, whereas the codeqnormcode function is ca. 40 faster in R. I tried the Rcpp package to speed up the R functions by using the corresponding C libraries which resulted in a decrease in runtime by 30 which is still significantly slower than Matlab for codernormcode and codepnormcode.p  pIs there a package availabe which provides a faster way of simulating normally distributed random variables in R other than using the standard codernormcode functionp

Negative 375 pI would like to be able to query with Javascript where a particular CSS property was assigned to an element. For instance, if an elements height is 40px, I would like to know if this was assigned via an stylesheet, whether it was assigned via an inline rule, or whether it is an automatic result of the layout engine.p  pFor some properties, like height I cant seem to be able to tell the difference by just looking at the computed style or the style property of the element itself.p  pIt turns out that I can detect inline style by parsing through style attributes, and I can find some stylesheets by parsing through the documents stylesheet and rules arrays.p  pMy current method of checking stylesheetsinline rules would work, but fails because Javascript cannot access stylesheets loaded from different domainsprotocols due to the same origin policy.p  pAny ideas on how to do thisp  pThanks Jeffp

Negative 375 pI am trying to develop an asp.net application in a modular fashion in which functionality is divided among different modules. For instance, one module is inventory management system which has its own UI, BLL, DAL and a separate database schema. Same goes for HR module and User Management.p  pThere is some data or I should say objects which are consumed by different modules. For instance Address, as Supplier Inventory has an address as well as Employee HR has too. Where should I keep such objects Should I define the address class in all modules which would mean duplicating code or in some global module which I think makes the modules dependent on the global module.p  pSometimes modules does need to use the objects defined in other modules. For instance inventory module requires Employee objectHR in order to perform some actions, which without the employee object wont be possible. I think this makes the Inventory Modules strongly coupled to HR, killing the purpose of modular design.p  pHow can we make the modules truly independent of each other   p

Negative 375 pI have a list of Strings. I want to evaluate each string based on a function that returns a double. Then I want the first 5 strings, based on their calculated values. If there are fewer than 5, I want all of them in order. Lets say the strings are chemical compounds and the function computes the mass. The function is computationally expensive I need to evaluate it once per string. Im just making up data here, though.p  precodeH2O gt 18.5 C12H11O22 gt 109.1 HeNe gt 32.0 H2SO4 gt 54.37 HCl gt 19.11 4FeO3 gt 82.39 Xe6 gt 281.9 codepre  pThe program should return the first five strings arranged in order by their respective values. For this sample data codeH20, HCl, HeNe, H2SO4, 4FeO3code. Actually, I dont really care about the order I just need the five lowest in any order.p  pI thought about how Id do this in Perl. Its just a few linesp  precodeforeach s str      strmaps  fs  sorted  sort  strmapa ltgt strmapb  keys strmap return sorted[0, 4] codepre  pBut I need to do it in Java. And its driving me crazy.p  pFirst I tried populating a codeHashMapltString, Doublegtcode, then using codeCollections.sortcode with a custom comparator, just like the Perl version. But scoping on the Comparator prevented it from referring to the HashMap to look up the values.p  pThen I tried a codeTreeMapltString, Doublegtcode, but it only sorts by key and no amount of coercing could get it to order the entries by value.p  pSo I tried a codeTreeMapltDouble, Stringgtcode. It will discard entries with the same Double. However, the likelihood of having Strings that map to the same Double is low, so I pressed forward. Adding the entries to the TreeMap is no problem, but I ran into issues trying to extract the values from it.p  pTreeMap supplies a method called codesubMapcode, but its parameters are the keys that delimit the subset. I dont know what they are I just want the first five of them. So I tried using the codevaluescode method to get all the values out of the TreeMap, hoping theyd be in order. Then I can just get the first ten.p  precodeArrayListltStringgt strs  ArrayListltStringgttreemap.values return new ArrayListltStringgtstrs.subList0, 5 codepre  pNope. Runtime error cannot cast TreeMapValues to ArrayList.p  precodeListltStringgt strs  ListltStringgttreemap.values return new ArrayListltStringgtstrs.subList0, 5 codepre  pSame. Runtime error trying to do the cast. OK, lets just assign to a Collection...p  precodeCollectionltStringgt strs  treemap.values return new ArrayListltStringgtstrs.subList0, 5 codepre  pSorry, codesubListcode isnt a method of Collection.p  precodeCollectionltStringgt strs  treemap.values ArrayListltStringgt a  new ArrayListltStringgtstrs return new ArrayListltStringgta.subList0,  5 codepre  pFinally, something that works But two extra data structures just to get the first five elements And Im not too wild about using Double as the key for TreeMap.p  pIs there a better solutionp

Negative 375 pI am trying to create a key element dynamically for my bootstrapped addon. Currently, I create a codekeysetcode element and append it to codedocument.getElementByIdmainKeyset.parentNodecode with codeappendChildcode and then create the codekeycode element codemyKeycode and append it to the codekeysetcode. I set the codekeycodes codeidcode, codemodifierscode, and codekeycode attributes and then do codemyKey.addEventListenercommand, function myFunctioncode to add a function to the codekeycode. After this, I can successfully call codemyFunctioncode by doing codemyKey.doCommandcode.  However, when I press the modifiers and key that I assigned in the codekeycodes attributes, nothing happens.p  pI am trying to avoid setting the codecommandcode and codeoncommandcode attributes because I know there is a security issue with setting codeoncommandcode dynamically, but maybe I do need to use them somehow  I have a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsXULkey relnofollowseen it stateda that a key can not work without command or oncommand set, so perhaps it is not possible to create a key dynamically without setting one of them. My event listener works if I set oncommand to void0 following the example given a hrefhttpblog.fpmurphy.com201102firefox4restartlessaddons.html relnofollowherea.

So far, this is the piece of code that I havep  precodeimport numpy as np   Read from .dat file with opentransacroleinResWVFunAP1R12.dat, r as f     fl  f.readline     xnum  f.readlines[2]     ynum  f.readlines[3]   Initialize some variables to be lists. xval  [] yval  []   Read the values of the number of X and Y values. for line in xnum     px  line.split     xval.appendintpx[0]  for line in ynum     py  line.split     yval.appendintpy[0]  linesx  np.ceilxval5.0 linesy  np.ceilyval5.0 linesz  np.ceilxvalyval5.0  with opentransacroleinResWVFunAP1R12.dat, r as f     for line in f         x  []         y  []         for element in line[43linesx].split             x.appendelement             for element in line[4linesx3linesxlinesy].split                 y.appendelement codepre  pSince I dont know how to read all the elements consecutively I used first a way of counting the number of lines that have X values, then the ones with Y values, and finally the ones with Z values, but I guess its not very efficient. I will really appreciate if someone can help me with this. Thanks,p

I tried to delete the text files where the cookies are stored, I tryed using different computers, IPs, browser but nothing seem to work. I need to wait 34h until the cookies expire. So my question is Can cookies somehow be cached by the server  On my local server it is working just perfect. Thank you  p

Additionally, something like the code below isnt ideal if it were implemented correctly somehow as it only accepts boolean argumentsp  precodeobject Container    def applyargs Boolean        doesnt REALLY work since number of arguments not enforced     Containerargs map  if  1L else 0L  toArray      val c1  Container1, 0, 1  works val c2  Containertrue, false, true  might be workable if done correctly val c3  Containertrue, 0, 1  wont work codepre  pI tried adding an implicit conversion in the companion object below, hoping that it would automatically be used in codeContainer.applycode, but it appears that this does not actually put the implicit conversion into the namespace of the code that calls apply.p  precodeobject Container    implicit def booleanToLongx Boolean Long  if x 1L else 0L  codepre  pIm able to get things working using this hackish workaroundp  precode   import Container.booleanToLong    all of these now work   val c1  Container1, 0, 1   val c2  Containertrue, false, true   val c3  Containertrue, 0, 1  works  codepre  pThe biggest problem is that I have to import codebooleanToLongcode into the code that wants to create a codeContainercode and thus must put it in its own block for safety codebooleanToLongcode is generally undesirable.p  pFinally, the solution of using an implicit parameter that itself includes an implicit conversion doesnt work because it would require an explicit overriding of codeapplycode, defeating the goal of not repeating a long parameter list and marshaling types.p  pIs there a way to do this such that I get implicit conversions for free every time I make a codeContainercode, but emnotem otherwise Or is this impossible due to some sort of technical constraintp

Negative 375 pIm playing around with Java Swing and im really confused when comes to JPanel vs JComponent. According to CoreJava Vol 1 cay horstmannp  blockquote   pInstead of extending JComponent, some programmers prefer to extend the   JPanel class. A JPanel is intended to be a container that can contain   other components, but it is also possible to paint on it. There is   just one difference. A panel is opaque, which  means that it is   responsible for painting all pixels within its bounds. The easiest    way to achieve that is to paint the panel with the background color,   by calling  super.paintComponent in the paintComponent method of each   panel subclassp blockquote  precodeclass NotHelloWorldPanel extends JPanel    public void paintComponentGraphics g      super.paintComponentg     . . .  code for drawing will go here     codepre  pI know what opaque is.

Negative 375 pWhat is the correct way to ensure that other people dont push to git remote repo while someone else is doing a timeconsuming mergerebase operation and would like the repo to remain stable while doing so Is there a elegant way to strongemlockemstrong the repo in a readonly mode until a person finishes with lengthy operation or is running the test suite to ensure everything plays wellp  pCurrently, were using a....creative read slightly unorthodox approach to this problem  we have a special file on a local, separate SVN repository that each team member has to emmanuallyem checkout i.e. perform a lock before doing pushes to remote git repo. Now, this approach such as it is works but is prone to errors and mind slips someone, usually a new team member, pushes in the middle of someone elses mergerebase. p  pThere has to be a more elegant way to do this. p  pNow, I am not a git expert in any way I am just a regular user but writing a custom command to do the lock shouldnt be too onerous. But that doesnt solve the problem of strongpreventingstrong the emotherem user from pushing to remote repo, i.e. how to make git repo conscious that somewhere out there, there is a flag that  if raised  should prevent user from pushing to repo.p  pIs there a more standard way to solve this, an existing pattern that people use Is there even a way to put the entire repo in readonly mode p  pI am open for any and all suggestions but would certainly like to avoid introducing new interrepositories andor dedicated persons that would be the only ones with premissions to push to the remote  we want all developers to have that capability but just to prevent stepping on each others toes.p

Negative 375 pI am attempting to automate some diagnostics using scripts in bash that call programsscripts that I did not personally write. Many of the scripts have menus based off case switches and read key presses, making it simple to feed in menu selections using a script, like sop  precodesh foo.sh ltltEOF 0 0 1 EOF codepre  pHowever, I have one particular menu that does not appear to be operating on a case switch and instead forces the user to use the arrow keys to select an option indicated with an x, followed by the [Enter] key.p  pWhen I try to feed in options as above, the menu locks up and I have to ctrlaltdel to restart this system. The only thing that seems to register is the new line, which advances the menu, but only on the first item in the menu. I have tried various escape sequences for the arrow keys, numbers, letters, etc, but to no avail. I have no idea how to create a menu that operates on arrow keys, so I dont have a basis to approach this problem.p  pTo boil this down, I need a way to feed in selections to a menu of this type whatever type it is, to help prevent the fatfingering that occurs when simple tasks must be conducted repeatedly, and no feedback exists to ensure correct selection until AFTER a 4 hour test is done.p  pEDIT For clarification, this is an older version of Ubuntu running in recovery mode. The programscript under scrutiny is a proprietary diagnostic that is fairly locked down and of an undetermined type or origin. p  pWhat Im hoping to get from here is, if not a solution, a lead in the right direction. As per suggestions, Im looking into expectautoexpect, as well as tput.p  pUPDATE So after some more investigation, I have discovered this is, in fact, an executable. I dont know if this clarifies my question, or renders what I am trying to do impractical, Ill let the gurus decide. At the very least, I know Im completely offtrack trying to feed in input the way I originally attempted.p

Negative 375 pI have been working on making a calendar in Java. In doing so, In order to store the information input while the application is running, I have exported the information to a txt file.

My problem is that when I leave the code as is, the last array to get added to the arrayList replaces all the other arrays, as my array arrInfo is located outside the for loop and thus is referenced with the same information over and over when it is called for in the end. When I put this array in the for loop, however, it is unable to store all the information for the array as it just gets remade over and over without storing more than one String.

Negative 375 pI have a Chromecast and a URL of an mp4 file online. I also have a 2Mbps download connection, which is pathetic and renders direct buffering to the Chromecast too slow. Thats what I tried  so farp  pThrough the developer console, I simply set location.href to the online URL of the mp4. The Chromecast would buffer for 20 seconds, play 10 seconds worth of video, and then buffer again. So, through the console, I paused the video and let it buffer for 5 minutes. When I let it play again, it played for about 15 seconds, and then lost all progress and had to be returned to the home screen.p  pAs I dont want to wait for the whole download of the mp4 to complete, I am currently attempting this I buffer the mp4 to a local file which is in my htdocs directory, and I then direct the Chromecast to that files location. However, when opening the mp4 file thorugh Chrome the browser, instead of playing, it shows a download prompt, and the Chromecast returns to the home screen.p  pI have implemented the buffering in PHP, and it looks as thusp  precodebufferSource  httpexample.compathtofile.mp4  bufferedReader  fopenbufferSource, r  whilefinished  feofbufferedReader      iffinished  false break       get onle line     buffer  fgetsbufferedReader       fileputcontentsbuffer.mp4, buffer, FILEAPPEND    fclosebufferedReader codepre  pI know that PHP does its work, as I can watch the file size grow on my computer, and I can open the file with VLC. Is there maybe another PHP script I could make to access the locally buffered mp4 file which simulates bufferability, so Chrome does not show the download dialog but buffers the file, as should do the Chromecastp  pstrongEDITstrong One more thing. I am not directing the Chromecast to the PHP script. I am actually directing it directly to the buffer.mp4 file.p

Negative 375 pI am trying to write a simple program that within its main loop calls different functions based on user input no problem here and to also perform some actions on its own  those are time based. Since I want to avoid potential data access issues Im not good at multithreading I was trying to use callbacks to ensure various autonomous parts of the program would be called every soandso milliseconds.p  pFrom what Ive found, boostasio looks like the way to go  however I dont know what is the correct approach here.

Is there a way to write callbacks to resemble timer interrupts from microcontrollersp  pSleep is not a solution  it would render the program unresponsive and wouldnt guarantee, that parts of the program are updated according to their schedule for instance GUI can update every 25ms, but image capture should occur only 10 times a second[100ms period as a heavy operation taking a lot of resources]p  pPerhaps there is a completely different approach that would be better I was thinking about more threads, but I fear if I try and thread every piece of program Ill end up with a bowl of spaghetti Id never be able to manage on the long run.p

Negative 375 pIve been dealing with a pernicious crash bug in my iPhone app, which is consistently reproducible in the version downloaded from the App Store, but not at all in the debug version. I have produced a workaround, which works by excluding the critical drawing code from running during a UIViewController animation.p  ul liThe crash log indicates that there is an assert failure in CGPathAddLineToPoint.li liThe app uses the drawing functions CGContextMoveToPoint, CGContextAddLineToPoint, and CGContextStrokePath. The functions CGPathCreateMutable, CGPathAddLines, and CGContextAddPath are also used, but the app still crashes even in configurations that should avoid invoking them.li liThe crash happens consistently when lines are drawn on a view while its UIViewController is being presented animated. Otherwise, the drawing works without issue.li liI have confirmed in the debug version that every point of every line drawn is real and within the boundaries of the view.li liThe app crashes immediately on iOS7 when the drawing is attempted. On iOS5 and iOS6, the app stops responding for 30 seconds before crashing, leaving behind an Unknown crash log with no information.li liThe only cases I could find on the web similar to this problem were CGFloatIsValid assert failures in CGPathAddLineToPoint in OS X apps including iPhoto crash logs posted to Apples support forums.li ul  pI cant say much more about it because the app never crashes or even gives a warning in the debug version. Has anyone else encountered this bug  Is there a better way to resolve this issuep  pYou can view the workaround in action in the release version a hrefhttpitunes.apple.comappid474209552 relnofollowon the App Storea. You can see that the line drawing on the graph is delayed until after the animation completes when you push the [Graph] button, when the calculator is in 2D mode.p  pThe important part of the crash log from an iPhone 5S running iOS 7.0.3, app armv7p  precodeException Type  EXCCRASH SIGABRT Exception Codes 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000 Triggered by Thread  0  Thread 0 Crashed 0   libsystemkernel.dylib          0x3a5e11fc pthreadkill  8 1   libsystempthread.dylib         0x3a648a4f pthreadkill  55 2   libsystemc.dylib               0x3a592029 abort  73 3   libsystemc.dylib               0x3a571c67 assertrtn  179 4   CoreGraphics                    0x2fd566f5 CGPathAddLineToPoint  149 5   My App                        0x001464cd 0xd7000  455885 6   UIKit                           0x324d4dd5 [UIViewCALayerDelegate drawLayerinContext]  369 7   QuartzCore                      0x3210aa75 [CALayer drawInContext]  97 8   QuartzCore                      0x320f4241 CABackingStoreUpdate  1857 9   QuartzCore                      0x321ce2e9 ZN2CA5Layer8displayEvblockinvoke  49 10  QuartzCore                      0x320f3af1 xblameallocations  81 11  QuartzCore                      0x320f37a3 CALayerdisplay  1115 12  QuartzCore                      0x320d7365 CALayerdisplayifneededCATransaction  205 13  QuartzCore                      0x320d6ffd CALayerlayoutanddisplayifneededCATransaction  21 14  QuartzCore                      0x320d6a09 CAContextcommittransactionCATransaction  225 15  QuartzCore                      0x320d681b CATransactioncommit  311 16  QuartzCore                      0x320d0549 CATransactionobservercallbackCFRunLoopObserver, unsigned long, void  53 17  CoreFoundation                  0x2fc9bf67 CFRUNLOOPISCALLINGOUTTOANOBSERVERCALLBACKFUNCTION  19 18  CoreFoundation                  0x2fc998f3 CFRunLoopDoObservers  283 19  CoreFoundation                  0x2fc99c3f CFRunLoopRun  735 20  CoreFoundation                  0x2fc0446d CFRunLoopRunSpecific  521 21  CoreFoundation                  0x2fc0424f CFRunLoopRunInMode  103 22  GraphicsServices                0x349382e7 GSEventRunModal  135 23  UIKit                           0x324b9841 UIApplicationMain  1133 24  My App                        0x000de723 0xd7000  30499 25  My App                        0x000dde0c 0xd7000  28172 codepre

Negative 375 pLet me come to the point directly. I have two tables named A and B. In table A I have a triggerAFTER INSERT which is responsible to insert a row in table B with NEW.ID in it.

Now the script tries to access the newly inserted row in table A.p  pThe problem I am unable to read the newly inserted row in table A. I can read the n1th row but not the nth row.

Negative 375 pI need to calculate both the union and the intersection of a set of arrayscollections in Cypher.

The problem is the union script is not generalizable and needs to be expanded further for each additional group member. This is because instead of doing a straightforward coden.interests  m.interestscode I am going the long way by producing coden.interests  m.interests  n.interests  m.interests  m.interests  n.interestscode which equals coden.interests  m.interestscode, but necessitates pairwise comparison of all individuals in the group.p  pHence my question Is there any better way in Cypher to produce the union of two collectionsarrays, without redundant results in the response collectionp  pP.S. As you may have noticed these interests dont really have an ordering, so I am actually treating Neo4j collections as sets.p  pP.S.2 It is possible that I am misunderstanding and incorrectly conflating the notions of collection and array in Cypher, in which case please dont hesitate to point out what the mistake is.p
Negative 375 pIn C programming, I find a weird problem, which counters my intuition. When I declare a codeintegercode as the codeINTMAXcode code2147483647code, defined in the limits.h and implicitly convert it to a codefloatcode value, it works fine, i.e., the float value is same with the maximum integer. And then, I convert the float back to an integer, something interesting happens. The new codeintegercode becomes the minimum integer code2147483648code.br The source codes look as belowp  precodeint a  INTMAX float b  a  b is correct int anew  b  anew becomes INTMIN codepre  pI am not sure what happens when the float number codebcode is converted to the integer codeanewcode.

I am reading about the scope inheritance and, as far as I understood, we cannot access childs scope from the parent, rightp  pSo I have this situation where I created a controller but forgot to set it in the template via codengcontrollercode detective.

Negative 375 pSo we have a slight dilemma about this in my office we are trying to define the best use of MVC so our developers follow the same structure of code writing and manipulation, making it easier in the future to read and edit by anyone.p  pWe have used a few different frameworks so this is not specific to any in particular, but the most popular at present is CodeIgniter as it follows MVC loosely and in theory lets you structure the code however you want. We seem to have arguments from both side of the fence about Models however which are as followsp  ol liyou should use models strongonlystrong for database queries and include minimal logicli liyou should use models strongonlystrong for database queries that are called from multiple locations and minimal logic eg insert queries tend to be called only once so put them in the controllerli liyou should use models strongonlystrong for common code regardless of whether it includes database queries or notli ol  pNow I know its not best practice per se, but I tend to gravitate towards example 3  I understand semantically why it is nice to separate all database queries from other code, but why invoke a model containing lots of other queries if you want to run a query that isnt called from anywhere else In my example above I give an insert query as an example surely this is just loading more overhead if it is called through a modelp  pLooking for your opinions on this, and not people just throwing best practice around without proper explanations.p

I need to CTRLampC to cancel out of it and get back to the active irb console input.p  pIf i try this in coderuby1.8.7p302code i get the same problem, but if i try it in coderuby1.9.3p194code then theres no problem it works fine.p  pI dont think this is RVM related because i get the same problem on the production server which has coderuby1.8.6p420code installed natively without using RVM.p  pIf i use code like this in my rails app, then it works fine ie renders out into html fine or whatever.  The problem just seems to occur in irb and the rails console.  So its more of an irritant than anything else it sometimes stops me pasting chunks of code from my codebase into the console.p  pAny ideas, anyonep

Negative 375 pI have a Grails application running with a very heavy backend data.Every selection made in the view of the application loads a new JSON file.I am new to developing web applications and I assume that this JSON file which is getting loaded is being loaded into the browsers cache memoryIts just a guess and I could be wrong too.Do correct me in that case.p  pWhy I came to this conclusion is because, after playing around with the application for some time and making different selections in the view, I observed that the browser crashesIn my case, it stops responding after the cumulative size of the JSON files loaded into the cache memoryassuming it to be cache memory exceeds 200MB.p  pIf the location where the files are being loaded is actually the cache memoryor be it any other storage location,I would like to delete the files loaded previously once a new selection is made.p  pIf this solution is not practical enough then, feel free to suggest any method that will solve my problem. Any help or suggestion will be appreciated.p

Negative 375 pI am a beginner Java student. This is the general idea of what Im doing.p  pI have a list of things that a user can pick from by inputting the corresponding number.  After they input ONE integer, the string next to the item prints as codeYEScode.

Perhaps this just wont workp  pIm trying to work with WebStorm on an SSHFS mounted disk at a clients office Im working at  Ive never used SSHFS before.  I am using OSX 10.9.2, installed SSHFS thru homebrew and installed OSXFUSE.p  pThe SSHFS mount dismounts periodically in any case, but since I started trying to use WebStorm with it it dismounts every time I start WebStorm and it starts scanning the files on the SSHFS disk WebStorm gives the message external file changes sync may be slow Project files cannot be watched are they under network mount and if I try to open files it freezes.  The SSHFS disc meanwhile has been dismounted.  If I remount via terminal WebStorm isnt happy and either freezes or just sits there.p  pI set up the WebStorm project using New project from existing files is there a way to set it up using SSHFS as a server  Beyond the login and password to the SSHFS disc I dont have any other serverspecific info, but perhaps could get it. p  pThanks for any help p

Negative 375 pI am looking to insert a 2025MB xml file into a database on a daily basis. The issue is that each entry needs an extra column added with a calculated value. So what I am wondering is if the most efficient way to do this would be using the SQLXML Bulk Load tools after editing the xml file, running through the xml file and add the new column then loading each item, or using the Bulk Load followed  by going through the database adding the new column values.p

Negative 375 pI have my jqgrid working fine with the grid reloading fully every time, however I would like to not fully reload the grid until the page is refreshed. The reason is that the user may be on page 5 of 10, and when the grid reloads it resets it back to the beginning  I want the user to stay on the same page with the updated data.p  pAnother approach I am looking into is saving the grid state somehow, the page its on, etc and navigate back to that after reload.

Negative 375 pI ran into an unusual git issue earlier that Ive since resolved, but Im still curious as to why it happened.p  pThe problem occurred when I accidentally deleted the branch I was currently working on. Normally git wouldnt allow this, but due to caseinsensitivity on OSX I got myself into a situation where I thought I had two branches, one named codefeatureONEcode and another named codefeatureonecode. Thinking these were two separate branches coming from a mostly linuxcasesensitive background and that I was working on featureONE I attempted to delete featureone using codegit branch Dcode.p  pI quickly noticed what I had done, tried to retrieve my lost work from codegit reflogcode, which gave me the error codefatal bad default revision HEADcode. I attempted to get back into a normal state using codegit checkout f developcode, which worked. However, when I looked at codegit reflogcode after this unfortunately it only had one entry stating codecheckout moving from featureONE to developcode. No previous actions appeared in the log.p  pIve compiled some steps to replicate this kind of scenario presumably this is only possible on caseinsensitive filesystemsp  precodemkdir test cd test git init echo hi gt file1 git add file1 git commit m test commit 1 git checkout b newbranch echo test2 gt file2 git add file2 git commit m test commit 2 git branch D NEWbranch git checkout f master git reflog codepre  pIve since been able to find my lost commits by checking codegitfsckcode, but my question is thisp  pWhy did this sequence of actions break reflog Shouldnt reflog still know the history of the HEAD ref, even though the branch was deletedp

Negative 375 pWhen reading low level audio from codeQAudioInputcode, the resulting data is a codeQByteArraycode. When setting up codeQAudioInputcode, you can tell it the Sample Type you want from the data.

Negative 375 pI need random numbers for procedural terrains etc. in a game. The game is based on the seed. I was told not to rely on the .NET frameworks Random class because the implementation may change and the seed may result in other values in other versions. This already happened... .NET 1.1 has a different implementation p  pThe most Random alternatives out there are for cryptography where the focus relies on very good numbers instead of performance.p  pSo what I look for is a very fast seed based pseudo random number generator that is independent from .NET versions, with average quality randomness.p

Negative 375 pI am generating public and private keys. My private key stays with me and the public ships with the plugin binaries we sell. Customer plugin side we take a fingerprint and hash it. Then along with some other implementation specifics we rsa encrypt it and send a lic. request over the web.p  pOn our side server gets lic. request and decrypts using private key. Then pulls up customer, checks fingerprint for deltas and other such particulars like payment received.p  pNow the question I have is my response. Say everything checks out good. I need to respond to the request with a valid key. Generating the key on my side is easy enough and sending as a response is straight forward....but how does my plugin product know it is validp  pIf I rsa encrypt it the plugin product...containing only the public key...cant decrypt it. If I embed some form of valid license checking code then it is easily disassembled and keys can be spoofed.p  pI know I cant make it crack proof. I am just looking to put deadbolts on doors and perhaps a security camera or two watching things...In essence making it less effort to pay for the product than buy all the equipment and spend time breaking in.p  pSo to restate for clarity. The question isnt generating a license key response...although I am always willing to learn or hear other ideas.p  pThe question is how, once the response is back to my customer plugin binary do I validate this is a key generated by me...and thus unlock the product for use.p  pThank You very much for your patient assistance.p
Negative 375 pI have a table with some events in conjunction with timestamp as DATETIME. Now I want to have a statistic about my data, e.g. how much events per day...

It generates a virtual table with my days i want to know and do a LEFT OUTER JOIN with my event table.  So i will got all dates without gaps The query looks like this e.g.p  precodeSELECT DATEFORMATd.date, d.m.Y as datum, COUNTl.id as anzahl  FROM   SELECT STRTODATE25.11.2014, d.m.Y as date UNION ALL SELECT STRTODATE26.11.2014, d.m.Y as date UNION ALL SELECT STRTODATE27.11.2014, d.m.Y as date UNION ALL  SELECT STRTODATE28.11.2014, d.m.Y as date UNION ALL  SELECT STRTODATE29.11.2014, d.m.Y as date UNION ALL  SELECT STRTODATE30.11.2014, d.m.Y as date UNION ALL  SELECT STRTODATE01.12.2014, d.m.Y as date  as d  LEFT OUTER JOIN events l ON d.date  DATEl.date  GROUP BY datum  ORDER BY datum DESC codepre  pThis query works absolute perfectly and i have also dates with no data in my statistic.p  pBut now comes the real problem i have the sorting doesnt work I got some weird output.

Negative 375 pIn the project Im working on, I have a script which runs nightly on Server A and launches an EC2 instance Server B which processes some data. Part of the data processing involves sending a file from Server A to Server B.  Since the IP address is different every time a new instance is launched, I get the standard The authenticity of host  cant be established... Are you sure you want to continue connecting yesno.p  pBecause of this, I have been struggling to automate this using scp. My first approach was to try to parse this message, validate the fingerprint I know what the fingerprint should be, and then have my script enter the correct response yes or no. I was unable to get this to work because from what Ive read scp doesnt readwrite to stdinstdout. A security feature I guessp  pNext I tried to write the .sshknownhosts file directly so I wouldnt get this message. This worked flawlessly, except in the case where there is an actual maninthemiddle attack, in which case the fingerprint is obviously incorrect, and this message appears.  Although unlikely, I would like to account for this case as well. Even something as simple as detecting that this message appeared, then retrying the connection, has proved difficult.p  pIm currently using PHP because thats what the rest of script on Server A is written in, but Ive tried Ruby and BASH as well. Im willing to write this in any language that will let me get this working.p  pAlso, Ive seen recommendations for using stricthostkeycheckingno, but Id really rather not do that, as this is in a production environment.p

Negative 375 pI have a controller where i managed to return a list of data from the database.

Look at the emfreqem variable, it has a subdivision string where it sums the emlowem, emmidem, and emhighem variables. So does this subdivision of the data make this array look incorrect to be a json formatp  pThe strange thing is that, if i copy and paste that string of data inside the javascript file, the pie chart is displayed. However, if i get that same data via ajax, it does not work Ive been struggling with it for weeks. If it is the same data string, then why isnt the pie chart displayedp  pHere is the codep  precodedocument.readyfunction     .ajax       url URLroutequery02,       type GET,       async true,       dataType json,tried html, text, everything, ...       success functiondatos,status, XHR            console.logdatos           if i call datos and put the string here, It does work.

Negative 375 pDue to limitations, I can only solve this from frontend javascriptHTML. I am waiting for a widget on my page async, websocket, after it loads it will display some text in different divslabels. I need to search this labels for some string and then replace it with an adequate one. This is just a temporary fix, the issue will be fixed from backend. So what would be a quick and proper way to wait for this element to be loaded and then searchreplace this elementsp  pPS I already know I can search for them with jquery selectors, I just wanna know what approach to take and where its better to place the code or if applying a common solution would be best.

Negative 375 pThe following are about IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 14.0.3 and Android Studio 1.1p  pApparently IntelliJ IDEA either IC or IU and Android Studio base on the same platform. Besides, according to a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformtoolsidealogmasterplugins relnofollowhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformtoolsidealogmasterpluginsa, the Gradle plugin of Android Studio are just a copy of that of IntelliJ IDEA. However there is another repository a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformprebuiltsgradleplugin relnofollowhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformprebuiltsgradleplugina that contains some files shipped by Android Studio but not IntelliJ IDEA.p  pBefore creating the first project in Android Studio, we may open the settings and check the offline checkbox, unplug the Ethernet wire, and build the new project just as normal. IntelliJ IDEA doesnt ship with a Gradle distribution or a local repository, and even after I copied those files and made the same directory tree, IntelliJ IDEA insists to download the Gradle distribution from the Internet.p  pIn some part of the world its difficult to access some sites, and the SQL feature in IU, which Android Studio doesnt provide, is very useful at least for me, while there are bugs when the latest SDK tool cooperates with Android projects without Gradle in IntelliJ IDEA. Nevertheless, I still believe that there must be someone awesome enough to come up with a good solution to this obstacle. Thank you very muchp

Negative 375 pThis is a question about an SO question I dont think it belongs in meta despite being sp by definition, but if someone feels it should go to math, crossvalidated, etc., please let me know. p  pBackground ForceBru asked this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28115724gettingbigrandomnumbersincc28116032noredirect1comment4689360928116032question a about how to generate a 64 bit random number using rand.  nwellnhof provided an answer that was accepted that basically takes the low 15 bits of 5 random numbers because MAXRAND is apparently only guaranteed to be 15bits on at least some compilers and glues them together and then drops the first 11 bits 1556411.  NikBougalis made a comment that while this seems reasonable, it wont pass many statistical tests of randomnes.  Foon me asked for a citation or an example of a test that it would fail.  NikBougalis replied with an answer that didnt elucidate me DavidSwartz suggested running it against dieharder.p  pSo, I ran dieharder.  I ran it against the algorithm in questionp  precodeunsigned long long llrand      unsigned long long r  0      for int i  0 i lt 5 i          r  r ltlt 15  rand amp 0x7FFF           return r amp 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL  codepre  pFor comparison, I also ran it against just rand and just 8bits of rand at at time.p  precodevoid randtest  int x srand1   while1            x  rand       fwriteampx,sizeofx,1,stdout       void randbytetest    srand1   while1            x  rand       c  x  256       fwriteampc,sizeofc,1,stdout       codepre  pThe algorithm under question came back with two tests showing weakenesses for rgblaggedsum for ntuple28 and one of the stsserials for ntuple8.p  pThe just using rand failed horribly on many tests, presumably because Im taking a number that has 15 bits of randomness and passing it off as 32 bits of randomness.p  pThe using the low 8 bits of rand at a time came back as weak for rgblaggedsum with ntuple 2, and edit failed dabmonobit, with tuple 12p  pMy questions isp  ol liAm I interpretting the results for 8 bits of randomly correctly, namely that given that one of the tests which was marked as good for the record, it also came back as weak for one of the dieharder tests marked suspect, came as weak and one as failed, rands randomness should be suspected.li liAm I interpretting the results for the algorithm under test correctly namely that this should also be marginally suspectedli liGiven the description of what the tests that came back as weak do e.g for stsserial looks at whether the distribution of bit patterns of a certain size is valid, should I be able to determine what the bias likely isli liIf 3, since Im not, can someone point out what I should be seeing li ol  pEdit understood that rand isnt guaranteed to be great.  Also, I tried to think what values would be less likely, and surmised zero, maxvalue, or repeated numbers might be... but doing a test of 1000000000 tries, the ratio is very near the expected value of 1 out of every 215 times e.g., in 1000000000 runs, we saw 30512 zeros, 30444 max, and 30301 repeats, and bc says that 30512  215 is 999817216 other runs had similar ratios including cases where max andor repeat was larger than zeros.p

Negative 375 pIm trying to implement functionality in my practice app very similar to that of Snapchat, where you drag a codeUITableViewCellcode to the right or left, and as youre dragging, an image behind the view is slowly appearing until it reaches a certain point, and after it does, it starts a segue or codePageViewControllercode type segue to another view controller that you can use to chat with your friend.p  pAt first, I tried using the screen edge pan gesture recognizer, but that only works if you start swiping from the edge of the screen. I need to be able to swipe from anywhere within the codeUITableViewCellcode. p  pA demonstration of my needed functionality is in Snapchat, where you see it more clearly when you slowly swipe right on one of your friends table cells and it slowly shows the image of a messaging icon and eventually leads to another view where you can chat.p  pSo would a pan gesture recognizer be enough for this If so, what would be the best method to follow to get this done Ive seen tutorials on pan gesture recognizers but I dont see how it could eventually lead to another view controller after swiping a certain distance. I think I could get away with putting the messaging icon behind the displayed table cell content that could appear while swiping right, but how could I implement such smooth functionalityp  pLearning this would really increase my experience in smooth user experience. Any advice or methods would be greatly appreciated, thanks.p  pEDIT Please leave answers in Objective C, please. I dont know Swift.p

Segmentation was introduced to overcome the limits of using 64K memory with 16bit addresses, in the Intel 8028680386 days. After that 32bit Intel machines still continued it for compatibility reasons.p  pNow moving onto 64bit The manuals say that segmentation is rarely implemented here ref a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiX86memorysegmentation relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiX86memorysegmentationa. The virtual memory and paging can provde access to the entire address space alongwith protection.p  pSo my question is How is a 64bit program compiled by 64bit compilers Do they still use the concept of segments because I still see the mentions of data segment, stack segment, etc as was before, but with higher  bit segment pointers Or, is the word segment referring to something completely different for 64bit architecturesp  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 375 pI am creating a function to convert an Array2D of Squares to a string and then save that string to a file. Moreover I am also creating a loading function that will take in a string from a file and convert that string to an Array2D.p  pThe Squares look like codetype Square   x  int y  int number  int optionList  int list code and also have a few functions for creation and manipulation.p  precodeGetter functions let getNumber S  S.number let getXpos S  S.x         let getYpos S  S.y let getSquareList S  S.optionList   createSquare creates a Square at position x y let createSquare x y   xx yy number  0 optionList  [1..9]   createSquareFromScratch creates a Square where you decide all parameters let createSquareFromScratch x y num li   xx yy number  num optionList  li   modifiedSquare creates a Square based on an old square let modifiedSquare x y S   xx yy number  getNumber S optionList  getSquareList S  codepre  pThe part of the Squares I want to save is the number and the optionList which will result in a 10 element long string with number first and then the list. The list can be 0 to 9 elements long so if the list is shorter than 9 elements the rest can be filled with 0s. For example 5123900000 where 5 is number and 1239 is the list and 00000 is the fill. p  pAccording to my reasoning the functions should therefor somehow build a string from the array2d, maybe by using a built in higher order function or if no proper one exist in array2d then first convert to a sequence and then use a proper function from there.p  pThe Squares are located in a 9x9 large Array2D and the order they are taken from the Array will be the order they are loaded in a later loading function which when loading them will give them their appropriate x and y values. p  pHow can I convert a string to an array2d of squares and array2d of squares to string p  pI have a lot of trial and error code that doesnt work but most of it is really bad and very obvious tests. Ex    p  precodelet loadGame gameAsString  string      let tmp  List.ofSeq gameAsString gt Seq.castltSquaregt gt Seq.toArray     Array2D.init 9 9 fun i j gt modifiedSquare i j tmp.[i1j1  1]  let rec gameBoardToString gameBoard  Square[,]      match gameBoard.[0,0] with      x gt x.number.ToString  x.optionList.ToString  codepre

Negative 375 pI am implementing an interface method that is asynchronous returns Task. However, my implementation is by necessity synchronous. Whats the best way to do this Is there some builtin way to do this Here are several options Im consideringp  ul lipOption 1 Task.FromResultp  precodereturn Task.FromResultComputeResult codepreli ul  pThis is good because my code runs synchronously. The disadvantage is that if ComputeResult fails or is canceled my method throws instead of returning a failed task.p  ul lipOption 2 Task.Runp  precodereturn Task.Run gt ComputeResult codepreli ul  pThis propagates failure and cancellation more naturally.

Negative 375 pHi Ive been working on an angularjs app on plnkr, and Im pulling data from a remote server to the app. Initially I had problems accessing the xml file because of the CORS issue, the crossdomain restriction, but I enabled CORS. The app now works on plnkr, but when I try to run it on the browser, the console gives me the same error, except with an additional note at the end. p  pThe error p  precodeXMLHttpRequest cannot load http50.22.49.2378084XMLFilesReformatedSample.xml. No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource. Origin null is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 403. codepre  pThe the reponse had HTTP status code 403 bit seems to be new. Whats going on Why does it work on plnkr and not in browser What do I need to do to fix it Any help is appreciated. p  pEdit The problem was with my browser  Google Chrome has a web security feature that doesnt allow me to open the app unless I disable it. I tested it in the disabled version of the browser and it works, but now I cant host these files on my website because the users wont be able to see the app if their web security is enabled. How do I work around this p

Negative 375 pIm having an issue with the bootstrap grid system where elements spilling onto the second line do not go all the way to the left.  I can tell that its caused by the uneven heights of previous columns, but I cant figure out how to get the behavior I want.  Below is an example of the issue.  Each red box outlines one codeltdiv classcolsmgtcode where codecode is a number between 1 and 12 and the number is the order that element appears in the DOM.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGQZT6.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGQZT6.png altenter image description hereap  pI would like to ensure that the elements are lined up in the order they appear in the DOM and that when spilling to the next line, they actually start on the left side of the page.  To do this, for example, element 5 would have to be further down the page to sit below element 2.  I would like to do this without actually placing elements in different codeltdiv classrowgtcodes because I want the fluidity of the column system.  Is there any way to do thisp
Negative 375 pI have a project involving a template website, that has a set of default text strings stored in a resx file, strongResource.resxstrongp  pI recently came across the idea of using an English language resx file, strongResource.en.resxstrong, to store text specific to each instance of the customized website. This way I can have certain pieces of text such as addresses or other contact information stored, while being able to easily change text for all instances of the template website. It is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5231476areresxfilesasuitablewaytocustomisefordifferentcustomersAre resx files a suitable way to customise for different customersa except that each instance of the website has its own environment, so there is no confusion on which version of the text should be loaded.p  pHowever, I have been encountering a problem where the text on the page is disappearing, with the exception of the text from the strongResource.en.resxstrong file. No errors are being thrown, the areas where the text appears are just appearing as blank. This can be fixed temporarily by doing an iis reset on the websites server, but I have not been able to determine how or why this is happening.p  pI believe that it is a caching issue, that somehow the resx is loading blank values for the missing values in the strongResource.en.resxstrong file, even though my understanding of resx files is that any missing key should default to the text from the default file. I have a theory that the text disappears sometimes after an iis reset which is also a method for making it reappear.p  pI am using C with .Net 4.5. I am not currently changing the websites culture directly, though that is something I will be adding in the future. My methodology works most of the time, but I need to know if there is a solution to this intermittent problem, or if I will need to find another method for more easily loading text.p  pHas anyone encountered this before, or have any idea why it might be happeningp

Negative 375 pPreamble assume I have the following C programp  precodeint main      int p1  new int     int p2  new int  codepre  pIt turns out that from launch to launch p1 and p2 will have the same values and p1 lt p2.p  pNow the problem I have a large program with multiple memory allocations on the heap. It turns out that with a rather high stability the pointers to the allocated memory bulks will have the same values from launch to launch and, consequently, their ordering will also be kept. But I want pointers not to keep their values and orderings from launch to launch. How can this behaviour be achieved with minimal changes to the existing code p  pMaybe, the problem can be solved by not changing the code, but by writing some accessory program. I thought about launching another process which would perform frequent memory allocationsdeallocations, but the different processes dont share the address space, so it doesnt seem to help.p

Negative 375 pIam trying to do something fancy. I have successfully written code to show results from database when a small form is filled and submit button is clicked.The results are shown right under the form. But I feel it would be nice if the page is automatically scrolled down to the div containing the results for the filled form. I suppose i have to use jquery or ajax for that. Since I have no knowledge in them I searched the internet for copy pasting the code. But none of them works.  p  pWhen the submit button is clicked,the page will reload to fetch results from database.I have got the code for scrolling down to a div when page reloads from net,but the problem with that is..the scrolling happens even thou submit button is not clicked. So can someone gimme the code for scrolling down to a div only  when the submit button is clicked and after when the page is reloaded.  p  pthe code is something like this  p  precodeltform namesearchdonor action idform methodPOST aligncenter enctypeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedgt                 ltformgt   ltinput typesubmit namesubmit idsubmit valueSubmit  onclickreturnsearchval gt  the div i want to scroll down is below one  ltdiv classcolsm8 idwhatgt ltdivgt   codepre  pstrongheres the complete code in html and phpmysqlistrong  p  precodeltdiv classcolsm4gt          lth1 classregistertitlegtSearch a Donorlth1gt               ltdiv idwrappergt               ltdiv idchatboxgt       ltform namesearchdonor action idform methodPOST aligncenter enctypeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedgt         lttable idresultsgt                 lttrgtlttdgtlth4gtCountrylth4gtlttdgtlttdgtampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp                  ltselect idslct1 namecountry onchangepopulate1this.id,slct2gt                   ltoption valuegtSelectltoptiongt                   ltoption valueIndiagtIndialtoptiongt                  ltselectgtlttdgtlttrgt                 lttrgtlttdgtlth4gtStatelth4gtlttdgtlttdgtampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp                  ltselect idslct2 namestate onchangepopulate2this.id,slct3gt                   ltoption valuegtSelectltoptiongt                  ltselectgtlttdgtlttrgt                 lttrgtlttdgtlth4gtDistrictlth4gtlttdgtlttdgtampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp                  ltselect idslct3 namedistrict onchangepopulate3this.id,slct4gt                   ltoption valuegtSelectltoptiongt                  ltselectgtlttdgtlttrgt                 lttrgtlttdgtlth4gtCitylth4gtlttdgtlttdgtampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp                  ltselect idslct4 namecitygt                   ltoption valuegtSelectltoptiongt                  ltselectgtlttdgtlttrgt                 lttrgtlttdgtlth4gtBlood grouplth4gtlttdgtlttdgtampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp                  ltselect namebloodgroupgt         ltoption valuegtSelectltoptiongt         ltoption valueAgtAltoptiongt         ltoption valueAgtAltoptiongt         ltoption valueBgtBltoptiongt         ltoption valueBgtBltoptiongt         ltoption valueOgtOltoptiongt         ltoption valueOgtOltoptiongt         ltoption valueABgtABltoptiongt         ltoption valueABgtABltoptiongt                 ltselectgtlttdgtlttrgt        ltformgt       lttablegtltbr gt      ltinput typesubmit namesubmit idsubmit valueSubmit  onclickreturnsearchvalgt     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt          ltdivgt           ltdiv classcolsm2gt          ltdivgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classdropdownwrapgt      ltphp       ifissetPOST[submit]                countryPOST[country]               statePOST[state]               districtPOST[district]               cityPOST[city]               bloodgroupPOST[bloodgroup]               gt      ltdiv classrowgtltbr gt         ltdiv classcolsm2gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm8 idwhatgt         lta classwhatgtltagt         ltphp echo lth4 aligncentergt Donors in ltbgt.city.ltbgt for ltbgt.bloodgroup.ltbgt arelth4gtgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm2gt         ltdivgt      ltdivgt        ltdiv classrowgt         ltdiv classcolsm2gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm8gt           ltdiv classtableresponsivegt             lttable idtablepaging classtable aligncentergt             lttheadgtlthr gt              lttrgt                 ltthgtltbgtFull Nameltbgtltthgt                 ltthgtltbgtContact Numberltbgtltthgt              lttrgt             lttheadgt             lttbodygt               ltphp                  connect  mysqliconnectlocalhost, root, , blood if mysqliconnecterrno echo Failed to connect to MySQL  . mysqliconnecterror               querySELECT  FROM users WHERE countrycountry ampamp statestate ampamp districtdistrict ampamp citycity ampamp bloodgroupbloodgroup ampamp activityavailable               resultmysqliqueryconnect,query or dieError, query failed               mysqlicloseconnect               if mysqlinumrowsresult  0                echolth3 aligncentergtSorry, No Donors Foundlth3gt                              elseifresult                              while row  mysqlifetcharrayresult                echolttrgt               echolttdgt.row[firstname].ampnbsp.row[lastname].lttdgt               echolttdgt.row[phonenumber].ltbr gt.row[secondnumber].lttdgt                              echolttrgt                               gt             lttbodygt            lttablegt             ltdiv idpageNavPosition aligncentergtltdivgt           ltdivgt          ltdivgt             ltdiv classcolsm2gt          ltdivgt   ltdivgt         ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre
