Positive 470 pI have an ASP.NET MVC Application I am working on. The core functionality of the Application all happens in the service layer, with the MVC Website just handling basic request routing and viewmodel preparation. p  pBecause this application will need to be customizable for 1...N number of clients that all may have different code needs, I want to develop the core functionality with a heavy reliance on Interfaces. In my reading, I feel like Unit or another Dependency Injection  IOC framework would be a idea for this code. All the examples I have seen so far though involve using Unity to resolve emeverythingem including the Controllers. This seems like overkill to me since I do not see needing this functionality. Is there a way to use an IoC container without abstracting away the entire MVC framework. p

Positive 470 pIm using CastleWindsor as my dependency injection framework and it all works well when youre in a Controller, because we can make use of constructor injection with the controllerfactory. p  pBut there are some specific cases that dependency injection  constructor injection  would not work.. For example I want to be able to resolve my dependencies still with IOC in some utility classes or extension methods  eg. of HtmlHelper  in my Views. I know that some people wouldnt agree on that and rather keep the views dumb, but lets keep that out the discussion. p  pSo this basically leaves me with one option and thats using... the service locator. So I know that the Service Locator is considered by emmostem people as an anti pattern and I do understand why.. But how do you resolve your dependencies with IOC if you cant use dependency injection For all that I know is that  its still better to use the service locator for IOC than having nothing. I would like to avoid the service locator pattern, but I do not seem to understand how to avoid it in some specific cases.p  pNext question is.. so even if you likedislike the service locator. Which is the best option to implement this with CastleWindsor p  pSo I guess the options would be 1 Expose the container as a global object  or through some other global object that wraps the container  that you can retrieve from anywhere in your code. You can then just call the resolve and release methods on the container. One thing I dont like about this is, that we have to call release explicitly for transient lifestyle objects. If an inexperience developer does not do this, youd end up having a memory leak. p  p2 I also found a hrefhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesCommonServiceLocator.WindsorAdapter relnofollowhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesCommonServiceLocator.WindsorAdaptera and it has a lot of downloads..  Same principal as option 1 but more generic and wraps the container so you can swap the DI framework easily  I looked into the code and I found out that the adapter only has methods to resolve objects. So I kinda wondered why theres no release method.. Does this mean this package has memory leak problems with transient lifestyle objectsp  pHope somebody can give me some advice on these matters p

Positive 470 pIm trying to build my tutorial project with routing. My main objective is to build two routes which wont generate 404 error in any case.

Adding the following code to web.config file p  precodeltcustomErrors modeOngt       lterror statusCode404 redirectHomeIndexgt ltcustomErrorsgt codepre  pHowever, I dont think that it is the best way to solve this problem.

Positive 470 pI am new to MVC I made a code first database then made a  New Scaffolded Item.

Positive 470 pI have, so far, managed to create default roles and a default user. Now, I would like to display a list of users to manage.  So, I have added a view model for a single userp  precodepublic class UserViewModel              [Required]         [DisplayName  Email]         [EmailAddress]         public string Email  get set           [Required]         [DisplayName  Enabled]         public Boolean Enabled get set          [Required]         [DisplayName Active]         public Boolean Active  get set        codepre  pNow, if anybody is wondering, Enabled and Active are needed for basic management.I know theres code to lock users out, but that is  as far as I know  a protection against multiple wrong logins and it should not change meaning. Now, this view model is a bit basic I still need all of the lockout stuff to add, so that the admin panel can take care of that as needed but its the principle I am after at the moment. So, with this ViewModel in place, I need another one which holds a collection of this stuff and, in its constructor, I need to navigate the Users table and basically assign values from the ApplicationUser to the above ViewModel.  p  pPlease note I have looked at the TypeCastException a hrefhttptypecastexception.compost20131111ExtendingIdentityAccountsandImplementingRoleBasedAuthenticationinASPNETMVC5.aspx relnofollowtutorial on the topica but that code strips out a lot of stuff Id like to keep such as external logins. That tutorial is also geared towards the higher goal of implementing groups which at the moment is not a priority for me but it will be once I have some other stuff going.p  p[UPDATE] Ok, it seems VS does not like my ViewModel without a key.I have researched this and it appears that VS thinks I am trying to create a new database entity which I really am not, promise.

Positive 470 pAssumed this would be a duplicate many times over, but I couldnt find anything doing quite what Im trying to do, so...p  pWithout too much detail, I have a set of web applications that work together, and share some databases...meaning each application has its own backend SQL database, however there are use cases where other applications in the system need access to data in another database.  Also, depending on how this system is installed, the physical locations of the web applications ASP.NET MVC can vary...for example, they may all be on a single machine, meaning all web applications have direct access to all databases, or in physically different placesnetworks...meaning we need a web interfaceservice odata v4 for some calls in some situations.p  pSo far, Ive handled this pretty well by developing the web applications completely decoupled from the underlying source.  Meaning, direct connections typically via EF6, though some direct ADO calls are in use too and web service calls oData v4 can be used interchangably, literally with the switch of a boolean value.  This is done via an independent interface library...so the controllerview levels of the web applications work with nothing but interfaces...both at the DBContextOdata client context level, and at the individual entity model level.  p  pNow, this all works great...however one aspect Im completely missing is the navigation properties of the models, which in some cases would be very helpful.  I have had virtually no luck trying to implement a generic interface for these objects in both 1n and nn scenarios, and Im thinking hoping that somebody has figured this out previously  It seems like somethign that would be fairly common, but perhaps not.  p  pIdeally, a navigation property, such as a set of say, Employees in a particular Company, could be accessed via an interface, such asp  precodeinterface ICompany       or IQueryableltgt, or Listltgt, etc    IEnumerableltIEmployeegt  Employees  get       other properties here...etc  codepre  pThis way, I could use this common interface interchangably, regardless of the datasource both the EFgenerated data models Company and Employee, and the Odata client generated models with the same name, both implement ICompany and IEmployee respectively.p  pIm not sure if this could be done is such a way that the underlying concrete types can work asis, or if Id have to do some manual coding for these types...such as writing a .Expand statement for the odata model manually and returning that, but either way would be acceptable.p  pThe only way Ive found is to add my own differentlynamed, obviously property to the interface, and manually add code to each concrete type via partial class definitions...but ideally Id like to have a cleaner solution, hopefully one that doesnt require additional properties that dont actually map to any entity in the database.p

Negative 470 pI am currently designing an application that has one module which will load large amounts of data from a database and reduce it to a much smaller set by various calculations depending on the circumstances.p  pMany of the more intensive operations behave deterministically and would lend themselves to parallel processing.p  pProvided I have a loop that iterates over a large number of data chunks arriving from the db and for each one call a deterministic function without side effects, how would I make it so that the program does not wait for the function to return but rather sets the next calls going, so they could be processed in parallel A naive approach to demonstrate the principle would do me for now.p  pI have read Googles MapReduce paper and while I could use the overall principle in a number of places, I wont, for now, target large clusters, rather its going to be a single multicore or multiCPU machine for version 1.0. So currently, Im not sure if I can actually use the library or would have to roll a dumbeddown basic version myself.p  pI am at an early stage of the design process and so far I am targeting Csomething for the speed critical bits and Python for the productivity critical bits as my languages. If there are compelling reasons, I might switch, but so far I am contented with my choice.p  pPlease note that Im aware of the fact that it might take longer to retrieve the next chunk from the database than to process the current one and the whole process would then be IObound. I would, however, assume for now that it isnt and in practice use a db cluster or memory caching or something else to be not IObound at this point.p

Negative 470 pI have a couple of identical files stored in more than one place on my hard disk. I figure I can save a lot of disk space by hardlinking them to point to the same file. I am a little worried about possibly disastrous side effects.p  pI guess it does not affect permissions, as those are stored in the respective directories, just like the file name, right emUpdate Apparently, I guessed wrong, permissions are shared, as Carl demonstrates in his answeremp  pThe biggest concern is changes to one file inadvertently also changing the other files. Readonly files should be safe then. And files that can be changed are also okay, if rather than updating within the existing file, a new file gets written. I believe most applications work that way, but probably not all. p  pIs there anything else to considerp  pI am on OS X  HFS.p

What is interesting is that after logging in, the login page throws the exception but I can manually navigate to the main page also JSF and see two more pages with functionality fine.  There are three pages in addition to the login page which throws the exception.p  pMy initial thought was that the separating feature would be the ttaglib for Tomahawk but that after a quick investigation does not seem to be the case as some of the working pages use Tomahawk and some doesnt.  p  hr  pEDIT Comparing two jsppages, one which failed, another one which didnt did not reveal any obvious difference which should cause this.  As it was pointed out that there has been reported this very bug with Tomahawk 1.1 and we were using 1.1.3, I have now upgraded to the latest Apache Myfaces Tomahawk 1.1.9, which appears to have resolved the issue with no sunwebapp at all.  p

If I have 2 contacts like John and Jack, my fullName list would sort these as Jack, John every time but my firstLetter list might sort them as John, Jack sometimes as its only sorting by the first letter and leaving the rest to chance. When these lists dont match up, I get a blank tableView with 0 items in it.p  pIm not really sure how I should go about fixing this issue, but its very frustrating.

Negative 470 pWe are doing a series of clientside performance tests for a large website and we primarily use Fiddler and DynaTrace for our measurements. But weve run into 2 major issuesp  ol liThe clients are intent on measuring the asynchronous part of the page load Stuff that gets kicked in after document.ready. Using fiddler, its hard to tell which http requests were a part of the original page fetch and which ones are kicked off by the document.ready event. We could do a quick test with JS disabled and that would give us an idea of which fetches are Asynchronous, but this is not a foolproof method either as this would not include requests which were made by JS files that were loaded synchronously.li ol  pOn paper, DynaTrace seems like the ideal solution to this problem, but the metrics Ive seen come from it dont seem to correlate to what we see otherwise. For eg., I created a dummy page with a JQuery document.ready event with a builtin delay using setTimeout. I was expecting the delay time value to closely match what I see in DynaTrace as the time taken for the load event but I did not see this correlation.p  ol liThe problem of scripting and continuous measurement. Neither of the tools seem scriptable in a way that would allow you to hook them up to a CI system and spit out a bunch of numbers ever build.li ol  pIs there another tool that can be used for this intent Is there an industry standard best practice solution that people use  Any homegrown hacks p

Negative 470 pIn my application I have an overview of objects. Each object is a UIButton, which has its own UIImage button.imageView. The user can drag objects around. Thereby, objects in the upper part of the display are considered to be in the back while objects in the lower part are in the front.

Negative 470 pGreetings all,p  pI have a shell toolbar extension written in C.  Its only meant to be used in Windows Explorer, so I want to prevent the DLL from being loaded in Internet Explorer.  Windows provides tons of ways to load extensions in IE only, but seemingly no way to do Explorer only.  I know there are various checks I could perform in different places after the DLL is loaded, but the ideal would be to prevent the DLL from loading at all.p  pNow, if it were written C, I would call codeGetModuleFileNamecode in codeDllMaincode, check if the executable was codeiexplore.execode, and return false on attach if so.  But there is no codeDllMaincode in C Microsoft doesnt trust us to play nice with loader lock.  Is there any other way I can selectively prevent a C DLL from loadingp

Negative 470 pAs per my understanding, C does not allow you to reseat a reference.  In other words, you cannot change the object that a reference refers to.  Its like a constant pointer in that regard e.g. codeint const a  3code.p  pIn some code I looked at today, I saw the followingp  precodeCMyObjectamp object  ObjectA.myObject  ... object  ObjectB.myObject codepre  pImmediately my alarm bells went off on the last line of code above.  Wasnt the code trying to reseat a reference  Yet the code compiled.p  pThen I realised that what the code was doing was simply invoking the assignment operator i.e. codeoperatorcode to reassign codeObjectAcodes internal object to codeObjectBcodes internal object.  The codeobjectcode reference still referred to codeObjectAcode, its just that the contents of codeObjectAcode now matched that of codeObjectBcode.p  pMy understanding is that the compiler will always generate a default assignment operator if you dont provide one, which does a shallow copy similar to the default copy constructor.p  pSince a reference is typed just like the underlying object that it refers to, doesnt that mean that we will always invoke the assignment operator when attempting to reseat a reference, thus preventing the compiler from complaining about thisp  pIve been racking my brains out trying to come up with an illegal line of code which will incorrectly try to reseat a reference, to get the compiler to complain.p  pCan anyone point me to an example of such codep

Negative 470 pCurrently I am working on a C linux daemon that takes user input for an SQL connection string, then stores the information into a local conf file client side. The purpose of the daemon is to submit data to an SQL database at a set interval in that every time the daemon is loaded it will look to the local conf for the SQL connection string. Also by using the command line argument c, the user can reconfigure the SQL connection string in the event that the information changes. Would anyone be willing to share a way of securing this conf file so that it is not plain text. Keep in mind that I still need to be able to access and read in from the conf file as there is other conf settings present. Thanks in advance guys.p  pEdit I do eventually plan to use SSL to submit the data between the client side and the SQL server.   p

Negative 470 pSo, im building a mobile web app with jQuery Mobile and i am having a problem.  I am using jQuery to parse an xml file and create list items.  It builds the list, then apppends that list of LIs to the UL on the page.  I read that in order to get the list to be styled correctly you have to call .listviewrefresh after you append the data to refresh the list so that the jQuery Mobile can set correct styling to the list.p  pMy problem is that the list never refreshes.  It keeps getting styled incorrectly.  Am i doing anything wrong  Is my code correct  FYI, i have tried all kinds of variations of .listview, .listviewrefresh, etc.p  pCODEp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt         window.loadfunction             .ajax                 type GET,                 url podcast.xml,                 dataType xml,                 async false,                 success parseXml                               function parseXmlxml             var podcastList               xml.finditem.eachfunction                 podcastList  ltli classuilihasthumb uibtn uibtniconright uili uibtnupc roleoption datathemecgtltimg src  this.finditunesimage.attrhref   classuilithumbgtlth3 classuiliheadinggtlta href  this.findenclosure.attrurl   classuilinkinheritgt  this.findtitle.text  ltagtlth3gtltp classuilidescgt  this.finditunessubtitle.text  ltpgtltligt                          podcastList.appendpodcastList             podcastList.listviewrefresh              ltscriptgt codepre  pThanksp

Negative 470 pIve been working on a genetic algorithm where there is a population consisting of individuals with a color, and a preference.  Preference and color are from a small number of finite states, probably around 4 or 5. example 11, 52, 33 etc p  pEvery individual casts a vote for their preference, which assists those individuals with that vote as their color.p  pMy current idea is to cycle through every individual, and calculate the chance that they should survive, based on number of votes, etc.  and then roll a die to see if they live.p  pIm currently doing it so that if codev[x]code represents the percent of votes for color codexcode, individual codekcode with color codeccode has codev[c]code chance of surviving.  However, this means that if there are equal numbers of all 5 types of aa individuals, 45 of them perish, and thats not good.p  pDoes anyone have any idea of a method of randomness I could use to determine the chance an individual has to survive  For instance, an algorithm that for codevcode votes for codeccode, codevcode individuals with color codeccode survive on statistical average.p

Negative 470 ol liAtom The Atom is the datatype used to describe Atomic Sentences or propositions. These are basically represented as a string.li liLiteral Literals correspond to either atoms or negations of atoms. In this implementation each literal is represented as a pair consisting of a boolean value, indicating the polarity of the Atom, and the actual Atom. Thus, the literal P is represented as True,P whereas its negation P as False,P. 2li liClause A Clause is a disjunction of literals, for example PvQvRvS. In this implementation this is represented as a list of Literals. So the last clause would be [True,P, True,Q, True,R,False,S].li liFormula A Formula is a conjunction of clauses, for example P vQRvP vQP vR. This is the CNF form of a propositional formula. In this implementation this is represented as a list of Clauses, so it is a list of lists of Literals. Our above example formula would be [[True,P, True,Q], [True,R, True,P, False,Q], [False, P, False,P]].li liModel A partial Model is a partial assignment of truth values to the Atoms in a Formula. In this implementation this is a list of Atom, Bool pairs, ie. the Atoms with their assignments. So in the above example of type Formula if we assigned true to P and false to Q then our model would be [P, True,Q, False]li ol  pOk so I wrote and update functionp  precode       update  Node gt [Node]  codepre  pIt takes in a Node and returns a list of the Nodes that result from assigning True to an unassigned atom in one case and False in the other ie. a case split. The list returned has two nodes as elements. One node  contains the formula with an atom assigned True and the model updated with this assignment, and the other contains the formula with the atom assigned False and the model updated to show this. The lists of unassigned atoms of each node are also  updated accordingly. This function makes use  of an  assign function to make the assignments. It also uses the chooseAtom function  to select the literal to assign.p  precode    update  Node gt [Node]     update formula, atoms, model  [assign chooseAtom atoms, True formula, remove chooseAtom atoms atoms, chooseAtom atoms,True insert model , assign chooseAtom atoms, False formula, remove chooseAtom atoms atoms, chooseAtom atoms, False insert model ]  codepre  pNow I have to do the same thing but this time I must  implement a variable selection heuristic.this should replace the chooseAtom and Im supposed to write a function update2 using itp  precode    type Atom  String     type Literal  Bool,Atom     type Clause  [Literal]       type Formula  [Clause]     type Model  [Atom, Bool]     type Node  Formula, [Atom], Model    update2  Node gt [Node]    update2  undefined codepre  pSo my question is how can I create a heurestic and to implement it into the update2 function ,that shoud behave identical to the update function p

Negative 470 pWe use an in house ORM where I work and in a lot of cases, we will need to do a number of different things in one transaction. Typically, I would wrapper a transaction in the middle tier around the whole thing, and hit success if its all good.p  pThe other option in our ORM is to build custom stored procedures which it just calls. I was wondering  would it be faster if I just made a custom stored procedure with a SQL transaction around it insteadp  pWouldnt that be much faster If so, why do most people choose the ORM route I mean, having your database objects appear in the object model makes things really simple as it appears in intellisense, but is that the only reason why you would forgo performance for ease of usep

Negative 470 pSimilar question to, Does it make sense to have multiple tomcat instances on the same server but in this case the Tomcats are running on a VM.p  pI know the answer probably is it depends, but Id like to explore the issue. When does it make sense What are the VM specific considerationsp  pReasons Ive heard 1 JVMs are somehow limited in their ability to use the resources available. So allocating more than one instance of tomcat will make better use of resources. Not sure that this is a good reason. Is this one of those things that was once true, but is no longer true  2 If one instance of tomcat fails, the other can take over. p  pDownsides Theres more overhead when you have multiple versions and greater complexity.p  pIf we need load balancing is it better to just put the second tomcat in another VMp

Negative 470 pIm trying to develop a model object to hold a Sql Server row, and I understand perfectly how to do this except for the TSqlSqlServer timestamp.  The table is defined asp  precodeCREATE TABLE activity  activityid int , ipaddress varchar39 , userid varchar255 , messagetext , dt timestamp  codepre  pWhen I resolve a table row to my object, for an int or a string I would expect to do something likep  precodeActivityID  intdataReader[activityid] IPAddress  stringdataReader[ipaddress] codepre  pBut what do I do about the timestamp column  Theres no timestamp datatype that I can find anywhere.  I know that Sql Server stores timestamp as an 8 byte binary, but what is this normally the equivalent of in .NETp  pstrongEdited to addstrong A little extra information... this is a row being returned from a DB2 table on our mainframe coming through a Sql Server view.  Rowversion isnt an option, and DB2 is handing the column off as a timestamp.  If timestamp and rowversion are identical, maybe I can treat it as one, but otherwise Im stuck with timestamp.p  pstrongEdited again to addstrong This project is going to drive me nuts.  It will, at least, be a short trip.  Anyway, yes JoelC this is a Sql Server view into a DB2 database on the mainframe.  I was finally able to track down one of our DBAs, who explained disdainfully that of course a DB2 TIMESTAMP comes across as to a Sql Server view as a datetime.  From his tone of voice I guess only noobs dont know this.  Thats why he named it datetime in the actual view, Duh I gave it a different name in my example so as to not trigger commentary on naming conventions  the actual data model diagram says its a TIMESTAMP and names it timestamp.  So, in this event, apparently one must cast it to a DateTime.  I think I may begin considering becoming a DBA so that I, too, can drive programmers crazy.  Sorry if I misled any of the responders to this question  it was unintentional, as I was actually expecting a timestamp to be, well, a timestamp.  Silly me.  Thanks are especially due to Microsoft for naming a bytearray datatype a timestamp when it has nothing to do with dates and times.  I havent the vaguest idea which response to mark as the Answer. Sigh.p

Negative 470 pAs Ive stated with a few other questions, Ive been using a a hrefhttpsshnet.codeplex.com relnofollownew SSH .NET librarya to connect to a Unix server and run various scripts and commands.  Well, Ive finally attempted to use it to run a Unix tail f on a live log file and display the tail in a Winforms RichTextBox.p  pSince the library is not fullyfleshed out, the only kindasorta solution Ive come up with seems lacking... like the feeling you get when you know there has to be a better way.  I have the connectiontailing code in a separate thread as to avoid UI thread lockups.  This thread supports cancellation request which will allow the connection to gracefully exit, the only way to ensure the process Unix side is killed.  Heres my code thus far which for the record seems to work, I would just like some thoughts on if this is the right way to go about itp  precodePasswordConnectionInfo connectionInfo  new PasswordConnectionInfolineIP, userName, password  string command  cd logs tail f   BuildFileName   rn  using var ssh  new SshClientconnectionInfo      ssh.Connect      var output  new MemoryStream     var shell  ssh.CreateShellEncoding.ASCII, command, output, output      shell.Start      long positionLastWrite  0      while TestBackgroundWorker.CancellationPending checks for cancel request                output.Position  positionLastWrite          var result  new StreamReaderoutput, Encoding.ASCII.ReadToEnd         positionLastWrite  output.Position         UpdateTextBoxresult          Thread.Sleep1000           shell.Stop     e.Cancel  true  codepre  pThe UpdateTextBox function is a threadsafe way of updating the RichTextBox used to display the tail from a different thread. The positionLastWrite stuff is an attempt to make sure I dont loose any data in between the Thread.Sleep1000.  p  pNow Im not sure about 2 things, first being that I have the feeling I might be missing out on some data each time with the whole changing MemoryStream position thing due to my lack of experiance with MemoryStreams, and the second being that the whole sleep for 1 second then update again thing seems pretty archaic and inefficient... any thoughtsp

Negative 470 pBy lock helpers I am referring to disposable objects with which locking can be implemented via codeusingcode statements.

Negative 470 pI am a fairly experienced midlevel developer that has spent quite a bit of time working on the backend of many webbased projects. Rarely getting into the uidisplay aspects. However, I am now a lead on a project that is in the process of taking an api to a service architecture using an asp.net mvc rest architecture. I have not problem doing this and have written many of these services already. however, I find myself wondering about the parts hidden by IISWAS and MVC.p  pWhat I am hoping to find is a good tutorial that explains what happens from the point a web page or webservice is requested to the point it is received by the web page or application takes over.

Negative 470 pI have created a custom post type called products and need to associate multiple images with one product. The actual data already exists in a different nonwordpress database in a table called productimages that simply has a productid, imageurl, and image title. I need to convert this data into wordpress format so wordpress can display everything I need. This is something that will be done regularly using sql automatically deleting products and meta data related and readding from our main database which changes regularly.p  pFrom what I can tell, the best way to make this work is to manually use sql to insert the productimages as attachment posts just like wordpress does when you upload media to wordpress. Then to associate the image with a product I have to manually insert records into postmeta but the data in postmeta is serialized or something and I am unsure how I would insert the data in the correct serialize format using mysql. Is it even possible to do this with mysqlp  pAm I going about this wrong Should I be doing something different I was originally going to use custom fields till I realized a custom field can only have one value and I needed two values imageurl and imagetitle for each image. So it seems programatically creating a post type of attachment for each image is the best way to go. yesp  pI look forward to anyones response to help in this matter.p

Negative 470 pWhen a new lead comes in, I want to use a before trigger and a Visualforce email template that contains lead field values to send an email using the SingleEmailMessage class.  The email is being generated, but all of the lead fields are null even though known via codeSystem.Debugcode they do have values going into the call.  p  pSince Im passing the stillunsaved lead Id via the codemail.setWhatIdlead.Idcode method, Im beginning to think that the mail class is using the Id value and trying to do a database lookup rather than as a reference to the still unsaved lead in memory.  p  pDoes anyone know if thats the case  My class works flawlessly when the lead already exists.p  pIf it is the case that the Apex mail class does a DB read, any pattern suggestions for the case where one needs to send and email and update a lead field value before the lead is saved  I cant use the Workflow email notification because the email is being addressed to customers, and theres some additional Apex code that sorts out what address to fetch from existing Account records based on some Lead fieldshence I think the need for using VF email templates in the first place.p

Negative 470 pIm implementing an NTier architecture in .Net, comprised of an Entity layer, a DAL layer, a Business layer, and a UI layer.p  pThe entities, in addition to primitive fields, contain navigation properties. An example of this would be an Invoice entity, which has an InvoiceLines property, which should return all InvoiceLine entities associated with the parent Invoice entity.p  pOwing to the fact that there is business logic which needs to be applied to these InvoiceLines once they have been retrieved from the persistence medium, and not wanting to duplicate code, the InvoiceLines property on the Invoice entity populates itself via a call to a GetInvoiceLinesByInvoiceID method within the business logic, which returns IEnumerable.p  pMy problem is this  I cannot separate out the layers into separate projects, since the Entities project depends on the Business project, and the Business project depends on the Entities project, thereby introducing a cross reference. I currently have all 3 layers Entities, DAL and Business living in the same project, which works fine, but means I cannot share just the Entities amongst other solutions.p  pI appreciate that by crossreferencing layers in this way Im violating some principle, but its extremely convenient to have navigation properties populated on my Entities with business logic applied to them.p  pCan anyone please suggest a better approach, or some way I can do this whilst keeping my layers in separate projectsp  pCheersp

Negative 470 h2I often need to concatenate fields in TSQL...h2  pTwo issues TSQL forces you to deal with when using the  operator are a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms19030928vSQL.9029.aspx relnofollowData Type Precedencea and NULL values.p  pWith Data Type Precedence, the problem is conversion errors.p  precode1 SELECT 1  B  Conversion ERROR 2 SELECT 1  1  2 3 SELECT 1  1  11 codepre  pIn 2, the varchar 1 is implicitly converted to an int, and the math works.  However, in 1, the int 1 is NOT implicitly converted to a varchar.  This is where DTP is IMO getting in the way.  Essentially, it favors Math functions over String functions.  emI Wishem  that DTP wasnt even a consideration in this case  why wouldnt the  operator be configured so that the operation could favor emsuccessem over specific datatypes  I wouldnt mind if it still favored MATH over String functions when possible  but why doesnt it favor String functions over Errors  The only way to be successful in 1 is to treat it as a string function  so its not like theres any ambiguity there.  Somebody at Microsoft thought that throwing an error in 1 would be more valuable to the programmer than treating the  as a string function.  Why  And why didnt they provide a way to override it Or did they...thats really the heart of my question.  codeSET STRINGPREFERENCE ONcode would have been nice  Pp  pIn order to deal with this, you have to do more work  you have to explicitly convert the 1 to a varchar, using any number of different string functions  typically CASTCONVERT, but also many others like LTRIM will work.  p  pConversions become workintensive when you deal with table fields when you dont know the datatype. This might workp  precodeSELECT Fall       [Term]    Output Fall 2011 codepre  pBut then again, it might not.  It just depends on what datatype of [Term] is.  And to complicate that, the dba might change the dataype at some point without telling anyone because it came as part of a big upgrade package once the vendor finally realized that there are only ever numbers stored in the [Term] field, or whatever reason.p  pSo if you want to be a boyscount, you do thisp  precodeSELECT Fall       LTRIM[Term]   codepre  pSo now Im running this LTRIM function every time, even though it emmightem not be necessary, because I dont know the datatype of [Term] OK  I can look that up, but thats almost like work, and I dont like interruptions while Im coding P emgrumpem, and also, I dont know that the datatype will never change.p  pThe second issue you have to confront with TSQL concatenation is how to deal with NULL values. For example, this would failp  precodeSELECT NULL  B codepre  pSo you need to do thisp  precodeSELECT Fall       LTRIMISNULL[Term],   codepre  pWhat a pain  I wish I could just do thisp  precodeSELECT Fall       [Term]   codepre  pSo Im wondering if there are any TSQL ways to avoid having to do explicit datatype conversions and null checks on every field where I have to ensure the  operator behaves itself as I need it to.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrongbr a1ex07 came up with a great answer for working around the NULL issue codeSET CONCATNULLYEILDSNULL OFFcode, but as I looked into it, it appears to be problematic as far as forcing stored procedures to recompile every time theyre executed.p

Negative 470 pI was wondering, is it possible to run a multiwindow OpenGL application on more than one GPU simultaneously To be more specific, lets say Ive created an application with two windows each sharing its GL context between each other. Now if Id move one of those windows from display 1 running on GPU 1 to display 2 running on GPU 2, would this actually work Would sharing contexts alone do the trickp  pMy first guess would be no. And if this is really not that simple, is there a way to accomplish this I could also imagine that it depends on whether the two GPUs are controlled by the same driver or not or even worse, let the machine have an ATI as well as an nVidia card, both supporting different GL versions.p  pI would appreciate any insights on this topic, purely informational since I cant find anything after quick googling. Does anyone know the possibilitiesp  pEDIT By the way, unfortunately I dont have a machine with multiple GPUs available at the moment, so I would test around a little bit.p

I didnt change IISs authentication to use Basic, so it was still set to use Anonymous authentication.  I refreshed the browser and the service displayed.

It all works perfectly and looks just the way i want it but, when i print it the 3rd row down has one of the rows of text move up onto the line above it. br br My question is how can i  make it print the way it is seen on the screen and why would it screw up only the 3rd row when all rows are made with the same code. br  br Thanks EDITp  precodewhile feoffilehandle csvText  fgetcsvfilehandle, 1024     username  csvText[1]     password  csvText[2]     profile  csvText[3]     daysValid  csvText[4]     expiry  csvText[5]  ifpos  0  ifcount  5 echo ltpgtltbr gtltpgt  count  0 else count  echo ltdiv classitemRowgt echo ltdiv classleftgt pos  1 gt lth4 classcentregtInternet Access Voucherlth4gt ltimg classimage src.icon.jpg gt ltdiv classinfogt lttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Username         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Password         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Profile         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Valid for         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Expiry date         lttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt ltdivgt ltdiv classuniqueInfogt lttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo usernamegt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo passwordgt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo profilegt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo daysValidgt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo expirygt         lttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt ltdivgt ltp classcentregtltbr gtPlease remember to disconnect to stop each session.ltpgt ltdivgt ltbr gt  ltphp  else  gt ltdiv classrightgt lth4 classcentregtInternet Access Voucherlth4gt ltimg classimageRight src.icon.jpg gt ltdiv classinfoRightgt lttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Username         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Password         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Profile         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Valid for         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             Expiry date         lttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt ltdivgt ltdiv classuniqueInfoRightgt lttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo usernamegt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo passwordgt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo profilegt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo daysValidgt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltphp echo expirygt         lttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt ltdivgt ltp classcentregtltbr gtPlease remember to disconnect to stop each session.ltpgt ltdivgt  ltdivgt  ltphp pos  0    gt codepre  pCSSp  precode.centre  textaligncenter   .itemRow  positionrelative top0px   .left  width500px positionrelative fontfamilyComic Sans, Comic sans MS, cursive borderstylesolid borderwidth1px   .right  width500px positionabsolute left600px top20px fontfamilyComic Sans, Comic sans MS, cursive borderstylesolid borderwidth1px   .image  positionabsolute top70px   .info  positionrelative left63px   .uniqueInfo  positionabsolute left250px top42px   .infoRight  positionrelative left63px top0px   .uniqueInfoRight  positionabsolute left250px top65px   .imageRight  positionabsolute top90px  codepre

Negative 470 pI read from lt Essential ASP.NET with Examples in C  the following statementp  blockquote   pAnother useful property to know about is the static Current property   of the HttpContext class. This property always points to the current   instance of the HttpContext class for the request being serviced. This   can be convenient if you are writing helper classes that will be used   from pages or other pipeline classes and may need to access the   context for whatever reason. By using the static Current property to   retrieve the context, you can avoid passing a reference to it to   helper classes. For example, the class shown in Listing 41 uses the   Current property of the context to access the QueryString and print   something to the current response buffer. strongNote that for this static   property to be correctly initialized, the caller must be executing on   the original request thread, so if you have spawned additional threads   to perform work during a request, you must take care to provide access   to the context class yourself.strongp blockquote  pI am wondering about the root cause of the bold part, and one thing leads to another, here is my thoughtsp  blockquote   pWe know that a process can have multiple threads. Each of these threads have their own stacks, respectively. These threads also have access to a shared memory area, the heap.p      pThe stack then, as I understand it, is kind of where all the context for that thread is stored. For a thread to access something in the heap it must use a pointer, and the pointer is stored on its stack.p      pSo when we make some crossthread calls, we must make sure that all the necessary context info is passed from the caller threads stack to the callee threads stack.p blockquote  pBut I am not quite sure if I made any mistake.p  pAny comments will be deeply appreciated.p  pThanks.p  h2ADDh2  pHere the stack is limited to stronguser stackstrong.p

Negative 470 pTitle pretty much says what Im asking but Ill just explain what Im after.p  pIve been reading up on Unit Testing lately but Im having trouble wrapping my head around mocks. and especially the mocking of objects that involve the system  systems resources.p  pSay you have class that needs to interact with a network.p  pFrom what Ive read around on Unit Testing within .NET, the pattern is to basically create a wrapper object around classes that interact with the network. And pass an interface of that object through a constructor for example to your logic class. Then during tests you could substitute that wrapper class with a mock one.p  pNow sometimes, a class is basic enough that it does not and should not accept weird adapters or wrappers through its constructor or setter functions.p  pIts basically making your code more complex by having each of your classes accept the classes it depends on in order to achieve unit testing.p  pSo my question is simply this, is there some sort of mechanism that during instancing of an object returns the real one  if its a normal run, and a mock one  if its a test run.p

Negative 470 pIve got a drawing area inside a scrolled window with convenience viewport, and this drawing area updates itself according to incoming motionnotifyevents. When I scroll the area though obviously no motion events are emitted, but I wanted to work around this, and so tried to connect the drawing areas scrollevent signal to the same motionnotify callback.p  pThe problem Im facing here is that this signal is emitted before the scrolled window has update its viewport, so in the callback, I end up with pointer coordinates that were true just before scrolling, making it look like the drawing area is always lagging a step behind the actual pointer when scrolling while not moving the pointer itself. I thought I could compensate for this by manually extracting the coordinates with gdkwindowgetpointer, but then I realized this cannot work as the pointer is technically still at its old position when the callback is commencing. I also tried using gsignalconnectafter in hopes it would have the callback get called after the viewport was scrolled, but it didnt help.p  pMy last hope would be to start a timer on scrollevents, and have the callback fire after a minimal amount of time, but this sounds realllly ugly, and Id like to avoid that at any cost.p  pAny ideas as to how this could be realized Thanks in advancep

Negative 470 pthis is one of my questions about unit testing.p  pIm reading The Art Of Unit Testing and at chapter 3 the author shows how to remove dependency between one or more classes. That seems clear to me. Whats not absolutely clear is the following point.p  pWhen I configure a test method with a stub, I configure it to return a specific value. Then I call the tested method exposed by the tested class. This method executes some logic and uses the return value of the stub. The problem is if the stub is configured to return the wrong value my test will probably fail.p  pSo the question is when I use stubs, should I ALWAYS configure them to return the expected value In my opininon this should be the correct way to test as if the stub return always the expected value Im sure to test only the logic inside the tested method.p  pWhat do you think about this Is there some case in which has some kind of sense to oblige the stub to return uncorrect valuesp  pThanks a lot, Marcop

Negative 470 pIve worked on a variety of demo projects with OpenGL and C, but theyve all involved simply rendering a single cube or similarly simple mesh with some interesting effects. For a simple scene like this, the vertex data for the cube could be stored in an inelegant global array. Im now looking into rendering more complex scenes, with multiple objects of different types.p  pI think it makes sense to have different classes for different types of objects codeRockcode, codeTreecode, codeCharactercode, etc, but Im wondering how to cleanly break up the data and rendering functionality for objects in the scene. Each class will store its own array of vertex positions, texture coordinates, normals, etc. However Im not sure where to put the OpenGL calls. Im thinking that I will have a loop in a codeWorldcode or codeScenecode class that iterates over all the objects in the scene and renders them.p  pShould rendering them involve calling a render method in each object codeRockrender, Treerender,...code or a single render method that takes in an object as a parameter coderenderRock, renderTree,...code The latter seems cleaner, since I wont have duplicate code in each class although that could be mitigated by inheriting from a single codeRenderableObjectcode class, and it allows the render method to be easily replaced if I want to later port to DirectX. On the other hand, Im not sure if I can keep them separate, since I might need OpenGL specific types stored in the objects anyway vertex buffers, for example. In addition, it seems a bit cumbersome to have the render functionality separate from the object, since it will have to call lots of codeGetcode methods to get the data from the objects. Finally, Im not sure how this system would handle objects that have to be drawn in different ways different shaders, different variables to pass in to the shaders, etc.p  pIs one of these designs clearly better than the other In what ways can I improve upon them to keep my code wellorganised and efficientp

Negative 470 pIm currently trying to build a function for hunting down files in nested zips.  The general problem I can handle and Ive got my code working correctly.  The problem Im having is related to compression formats.p  pDefault zip files are not an issue, I open my zipinputstream, send it to my search function, check for each of the entries if it is a zip file and if so I wrap the inputstream in another zipinputstream and recurse.  The problem comes when I have a non standard zip compression.p  pI would like to make this function much more robust to be able to detect the compression format of the zip entry, wrap it in the correct deflater, and then wrap that in a zipinputstream so that I can recurse.  The problem is I dont know how to decode the compression settings.  I also dont know how to handle other zip compression formats.  p  pAny advice on how to make this function more flexible would be helpful.  I intend to integrate this into my own personal libraries so will be using this function from all sorts of directions in the future. p

Negative 470 pI have a wall of boxes created by a wordpress loop that uses jquery masonry. Each box contains a thumb and I hide the information about each image and want to expand each box vertically using jquery on hover. My problem is I dont want to overlay content on another box and I could only figure out how to adjust the entire masonry on hover which causes problems when the reloading of masonry causes the hovered box to be in a different spot. So I need to only make the the boxs underneath the hovered box in its column move down without changing the format of the rest of the masonry structure if that makes any sense. You can see an example of what I have so far in this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netYD7GU relnofollowjsfiddlea.p  pAlso I tried to give the hovered box a fixed position with jquery in an attempt to lock it in place but the masonry reload changes it right back to absolute but I think Im on to something there.p

Negative 470 pSince, it takes a while to upload an iOS app. It is very costly if you upload a bad copy because it will probably take another week for you to find out if a bad copy was uploaded and another week after that to fix it hoping you uploaded a good copy this time.  We came up with this idea of having two versions of our app in the app store one called beta and the other production worthy. A production worthy upload will only be a beta that has been tested.  Anyways, I wanted to find if there was a way to restrict my bad only for certain users. Please note I have already tried adhoc distribution and all the beta testing that apple lets you do in registered devices. I am asking if in the app store itself can this app be restricted to certain devices or may be accounts p

Negative 470 pIm having a bizarre issue that I dont know how to solve and was wondering if you guys could help.p  pA bit of background I have been asked to create a system where subpages of a page in wordpress are loaded on the end of that page in an infinite scroll. This is working correctly. p  pThey also want the top nav links to load all content upto and including the page they clicked and then scroll to it. p  pIf I scroll down loading the pages and then click a top nav link the scroll works correctly. However if I load NO further pages before clicking one of the links, the pages will load, and the scroll will start, but will only get some of the way before stopping.

I can block banned web sites but cant allow other web sites in my program. p  pIn the filter program, you will open a TCP socket at the specified port and wait for connections. If a request comes i.e. the client types a URL to access a web site, the application will process it to decide whether access is allowed or not and then, using the same socket, it will send the reply back to the client. After the client opened her connection to WebPolice and her request has been checked and is allowed, the real web page needs to be shown to the client. Therefore, since the user already gave her request, now it is WebPolices turn to forward the request so that the user can get the web page. Thus, WebPolice acts as a client and requests the web page. This means you need to open a connection to the web server without closing the connection to the user, forward the request over this connection, get the reply and forward it back to the client. You will use threads to handle multiple connections at the same time andor at different times.p

Negative 470 pFor our company websites we develop in a style that would be most accurately called Continuous Deployment httptoni.org20100519inpraiseofcontinuousdeploymentthewordpresscomstoryp  pWe have a web farm and every site is located on two servers for fail over purposes.  We wish to automate the process of deploying to our dev server, test server, and prod servers.  Out websites are ASP.Net websites not web applications so we dont do builds, we just push the pages.  We generally change our main site anywhere from 220 times a day depending on many variables.  These changes can be simple texthtml changes to adding new pagesfunctionality.p  pCurrently we use TFS for our source control, and each site is its own repository.  We dont have branches, you manually push your changes to dev we develop on local machines when it needs to be reviewed, then after sign off you check in your changes and push them to prod manually this ensures that the source files are what is actually on prod and merges happen right then.  Obviously there is a lot of room for error in here and it happens, infrequently, where a dev forgets a critical file and brings down the entire site.p  pIt seems that most deployment tools are built upon a build process, which isnt something we are likely to move to since we need to be extremely agile in meeting our business needs.  What wed really like, we think, is something like the followingp  ol liDev gets latest version of website from source control, which is essentially a copy of productionli liDev does work on his own box.li liWhen it is ready to be reviewed by task owner he creates some form of changeset either checking in the change or something else and a tool would then push that change to devli liAfter review and further possible changes dev then is able to have the tool push all the changes for this task to test UATli liAfter this sign off the changes are automatically pushed to prod and checked into the prod branch, or whatever, for anyone else to getli ol  pWeve toyed around with the idea of having three branches of the code in TFS, but we arent sure how you would pull from one branch prod but check in to a dev branch none of us are TFS gurus.p  pSo, how have other people handled this scenario  We are not wedded to TFS as a source control provider if there is something out there that would do what we wanted, nor do we require a vertical solution, we are more than happy to plug in different components as long as they can be plugged in, or even develop our own if we have to.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 470 pWe are building a product that uses the apache hadoop amp hbase frameworks for handling some of our big data requirements. We are also using Oracle for our reporting requirements. We are keen to go with the OSGi way of bundling our software to take advantage of the remote deployment,service management amp loosely coupled packaging features that OSGi containers offer.p  pWe have a few doubts in this areap  ol lipWhen it comes to our own Java apps, we now know how to create OSGi bundles out of them and deploy them over OSGi containers. But how do we handle Java based 3PPs that have a clustered architecture, for example HBaseHadoop We saw that Fuse Fabric has created a Hadoop actually only HDFS not Map Reduce bundle, but in general how do you go about creating bundles for 3PPspli lipHow do we handle nonjava based 3PPs like for example Oracle. Should we create a OSGi bundle for it and deploy over OSGi or should we install these 3PPs outside of OSGi and write some monitoring scripts that are triggered over OSGi to track the status of these 3PPs What are the best practices in this areapli lipAre all bundles launched over OSGi container like Karaf run within the same single JVM of the container Some of our applications and 3PPs are huge and we may run into heapGC issues if all of them are run inside a single JVM. What are the best practices herepli ol  pThanks amp Regards Skandap

Negative 470 pI need to create a method that takes a param as codemaxValuecode. And loop through it from 0 but once it uses one index, it must not use it again.p  pstrongExplanationstrongp  pLets take an example, codemaxValuecode is 2000. Now it should go from 0 to 2000 but the start index keeps change by other thread. Like it can be 0 again or it can be 1900 or 1999, can be any number less than codemaxValuecode. So it should keep loop from starting index to end and then loop for the rest of items.p  pHere is what I have triedp  precodepublic int i  0  keep changes by other thread  public void DoStuffint maxValue      HashSetltIntegergt valuesSet  new HashSetltIntegergt             fill hashset     for int a  0 a lt maxValue a         valuesSet.adda             for  i lt maxValue i          if valuesSet.containsi              valuesSet.removei              SomeMethodi                   if valuesSet.isEmpty must check isEmpty first             break         if i  maxValue  1  reset i to 0 to use remaining items in hashset             i  0       codepre  pI havent tested this code but I can see the problem will come if other thread keep set i to 0 or some less value than codemaxValuecode and this loop will go infinite. While it should be something better. Any idea guysp  pEdited br Deep Examplebr codei0code and codemaxValue2000codebrp  pDoStuff gets called and when codeicode reaches to 100 through loop, codeicode got set by other thread to 1600, loop is keep going but again codeicode got set to 30 by same other thread and then again and again it get set by other thread, Untill all the items in codevaluesSetcode get called in codeSomeMethodicode. But problem is, if 1 or more item left in codevaluesSetcode like 1998 or 1999 and codeicode keep get set to lower like 0 or 10 or 100, the loop has very low chances to break or finish.p  pWhat I want is, if once a number0 to maxValue get called in codeSomeMethodcode, it must not get called again, while the starting number keep changes and codeSomeMethodcode must have called with all numbers till maxValue. If codeSomeMethodcode get called till maxValue and still numbers left, it should start again with lowest number.p

Negative 470 pIf youve read some of my previous questions you know I had a problem that I solved with iFrames. Anyways, what I would like now is to be able to update the page that the iFrame shows its a local page of mine when I click an update button. How is this possible without updating the page Im onp  pBackground info Im on home.php where I have an iFrame. This iFrame shows the page something.php, which is one of my pages. I had to be able to update home.php without waiting for something.php to update, so the solution was to place them in two documents and then include it using iFrames now home.php can be shown without waiting for something.php. The content of this something.php is dynamic and updates based on other webpages. Lets say the user wants to update the content of this iFrame, or the content doesnt show up. He will then be given an button update which will just refresh the something.php page, without refreshing home.phpp  pCan this be done preferably in PHP, but JavaScriptjQuery is also welcomep

It should be able to receive data from the AJAX call, and adjust the Serial writing command based on the info it receives.  I need help getting that info into variables that I can work with.  I assume I should also pass back some kind of Im done message back to the JavaScript calling function.p  pIm looking forward to any insight that folks might have on either high level issues, or ways to solve more specific problems that Ive listed here.p  pThanksp
Negative 470 pHello im working on a project using SDL library, im quite new to it and trying to get a hang of it... Im not sure if its possible but im trying to make a background map that is independent to the camera. Lets say that background would be parent function to the camera and it would have its own coordinates, like lets say example League of Legends the map is loaded at the start of the game and every player, monster, etc. is updated its position and everything else and you move the camera freely on the map. Right now I believe that your camera the screen is the parent and it has the coordinates of its own and it is actually background moving on the screen and not the camera moving on the map. I would be really thankful for any help or the info on how to make that if its even possible.p
Negative 470 pIm trying to set the background to an image.p  pcodep  precode    [self.view setBackgroundColor[UIColor colorWithPatternImage[UIImage imageNamedmyPic]]] codepre  pMy original plan was to set the self.window to the background image and then have the other views be clear. Using self.window in the app delegate But after that turned our to give me a plain black screen  , I moved and adjusted the code to my RootViewController. Im still getting a plain black screen. I tried using a few different images, yet Im getting the same result on all of them. Any Ideas Thanksp
Negative 470 pI build an app with Phonegap. My problem is that in the 2.2 version of android an input field is centering correctly but in the higher versions the input field is displayed at the left side. For me this makes no sense because i thought phonegap is displayed the same way on all devices and that phonegap works like an webkit browser. What did i understand false about it p

Negative 470 pWe want to accept credit card swipes via iPhone and Android phones but cannot find any devices that connect via the headphone jack that will populate a field in the phones browser.  This is very easy to do with USB devices connected to a PC.  p  pThere are several existing phone jack devices with proprietary APIs but from what I can tell these require native applications.  It makes sense for this to be standardized or for there to be an open source API but maybe the market isnt there yet.  p  pDoes anyone know of a way to get a headphone jack credit card swiper to populate a field in the phones browserp  pEDIT This doesnt seem possible.  For some reason no one has a problem with using HID  standard USB readers for PCs  Macs, but this is not ok for phones and tablets.  So the best option appears to be to to use PhoneGap to connect to a low cost reader.  p  pBut heres the problem Readers choices appear to be 50100 devices or 5 devices from China that we cant get to work reliably.

Negative 470 pIm trying to implement login functionality using the play 2.1 framework. At first i just used plaintext storing of passwords for which all tests succeeded, so now Ive written an enhancement using the JBcrypt library. My code should be correct also according to the principles used in a hrefhttpsgithub.comyesnaultPlay20StartApptreemasterapp relnofollowhttpsgithub.comyesnaultPlay20StartApptreemasterappa. Now however, when i try to run the same login testcases, they fail. BCrypt gives an invalid salt version error. Ive been searching why, but i think i found the problem. To have some initial test data before executing the test I load a testdata.yml file with some users defined asp  precode models.Person     ID 123     lastName  Tom      firstName  Tom     password   secret codepre  pIn my Person class constructor, password is hashed using the Bcrypt hashpw method and then the hashed password is stored in the user object. The problem however now is at least thats what i think that the yaml parser  doesnt use my constructor but just creates an empty Person object, and manually fills in its values. So the password isnt hashed and has value secret. So then when i try to test the login functionality and use BCrypt.checkpw, it compares secret to secret instead of secret to bcryptsalthashedpassword and thats why it gives an error salt version invalid, because secret has not the required salt form etc.p  pSo my question is Is it possible to call a method in a ymlfile  For examplep  precode models.Person     bebrasID   123     lastName   Tom     firstName  Tom     password   BCrypt.hashpwsecret, BCrypt.gensalt codepre  pOr is there some way I can force yml to use my constructor instead of manually filling the values  So actually, i just need a method using my data ymlfile to use BCrypt on a plaintext password before yaml stores it in the Person object Is this possiblep
Negative 470 pLets say I have a users table with a field called usertype, for simple explanation if usertype is C this user is a clinics owner, if usertype is D this user is a dentist.p  pI would like dentists in this system belong to clinics which heshe associates to. p  pMy questions are...p  ol lipDo I need clinics and dentists database tables pli lipIf I didnt need those 2 tables then how many models do I need, just a User model or Clinic and Dentist models as well pli lipIf all I need is just a User model, please hint me how do I write the User model and associated linking belongsTo, hasManypli ol  pP.S. Clinics owners and dentists are users of the system.p  pPlease advise me. Thanks. p  hr  h2More about the systemh2  pThis system is intended for clinics owners as the paid customers of the system. The system will allow them to advertise the job offers for dentists and assistants.p  pThe dentists and assistants can register themselves to the system after they get hired by the clinics owner, the clinics owner will become their employer and keep records of how they work in the system. If they quit the clinic also update hisher employed status.p  pThe records that each clinic keep can be seen by other clinic.p  pIts actually like employer and employee model, but because of online system so I thought of User model.p  pShould I decide the system like, any user just register first, so heshe become a user of the system, after that they need to fill in more information whether they are employer clinics owner or employee dentists or assistants, these information are kept in seperate tables such as clinics, dentists, assistants, and there are finally the models in CakePHPp  pThanksp

Negative 470 pstrongUpdatestrong Fiddle w full solution a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netlangdonxVXBHG relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netlangdonxVXBHGap  hr  pIn efforts to compare and contrast KnockoutJS and AngularJS, I ran through the a hrefhttplearn.knockoutjs.com relnofollowKnockoutJS interactive tutoriala, and after each section, Id rewrite it in AngularJS using what little I already knew  the a hrefhttpdocs.angularjs.orgapi relnofollowAngularJS referencea.p  pWhen I got to step 3 of the a hrefhttplearn.knockoutjs.comtutorialcustombindings relnofollowCreating custom bindingsa tutorial, I figured it would be a good time to get spun up on Angular Directives and write a custom tag.  Then I failed miserably.p  pIm up against two issues that I havent been able to figure out.  I created a new Fiddle to try and wrap my head around what was going on...p  ul listrong1strong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netlangdonxgWjXc6 relnofollowfiddlea I figured out my scoping issue, but, is it possible to just passthrough codengclickcode  The only way I could get it to work is to rename it to codejqbclickcode  which is a little annoying.li listrong2strong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netlangdonxgWjXc5 relnofollowfiddlea As soon as I applied code.buttoncode to my element, things went weird.  My guess is because both Angular and jQuery UI are manipulating the HTML.  I wouldnt expect this, but Angular seems to be providing its own codespancode for my codebuttoncode see line 21 of the JavaScript, and of course so is jQuery UI, which I would expect.  I hacked up the HTML to get it looking right, but even before that, none of the functionality works.  I still have the scope issue, and theres no template binding.  What am I missingli ul  pI understand that theres an AngularUI project I should be taking a look at and I can probably pull off what Im trying to do with just CSS, but at this point its more about learning how to use Directives rather than thinking this is a good idea.p

Negative 470 pConcept So in an effort to learn more about web programming, I am trying to make a google chrome extension for my friends and myself which would display the amount of an imaginary currency we all have and the user would have the ability to give some to another user with the click of a button. There will only be 10 users including myself. There will be a button next to the omnibox which when clicked would open a popup popup.html that displays everyones Name, Amount of Currency, and a  button which would subtract 1 unit from the user and add 1 unit to the person whose button was clicked. In order to identify the current user, when they first run the extension, it would prompt them for an ID number which I would provide for my friends personally.p  pApproach Ive found plenty of documentation on how to build basic chrome extensions, so that isnt much of an issue. Storing, manipulating, and displaying the currency is the part I have trouble with. My original idea was to just use WebSQL because chrome supposedly works well with it and I am proficient in Oracle SQL already. However it looks like WebSQL is an abandoned platform.  My next approach was to use a MySQL database hosted on a server, and use phpajax which I am looking into learning to pull the the info from the database, display it in the extension, and manipulate the data. However I have read that you cant use php with a chrome extension. But my thought was I could have the buttons codeonclickcode link to a php script with the arguments in the URL on the same server as the mysql databse. But I dont know if I could handle displaying the values the same way. Also I would store the User ID with codelocalstoragecode.p  pCan anyone tell me if this is possible Or at least point in the right direction I am not begging to be spoonfed code, I just want to know which approach I need to take to tackle this.p

Each JVM occupies around 20M of RAM so 20190 is around 4G.

Negative 470 pI am currently working on a Rails project where I am encountering an extremely weird issue with Devise . Initially my client wanted me to have a two step registration i.e. a user fills out a basic information on website and than receive a confirmation link Confirmable module. The confirmation link is going to take the user to the second step of registration where the user is going to fill out the rest of the important information needed to use the application. This was implemented successfully and was working great. p  pRecently my client decided to change this behaviour and just have one user registration page and no confirmation email being sent to user. I reverted all the Devise Controllers I modified to get the default behaviour and now there is an extremely weird behaviour in application. If I go to Sign up page and submit the form with user information it redirects back to the sign up page and also sign in the user. So the header changes to the one for signed in user but the page rendered is the registration page where as at the very basic level it should at least redirect the signed in user to the root path. p  pSame is the case with login page. The user gets signed in but keeps on getting redirected to the same login page. So far I have tried the following workarounds and none of them seems to work p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowTo3aredirecttoaspecificpageonsuccessfulsignin relnofollowDevise Wikiap  pa hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowTo3aRedirecttoaspecificpageonsuccessfulsigninandsignout relnofollowHow To Redirect to a specific page on successful sign in and sign outap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6989421afterasuccessfuldeviseloginhowtoredirectuserbacktopreviousactionthStackoverflow questionap  pAlso in addition to this I have not left even one single stackoverflow answer that resembles the problem I am having and also went through the issues in devise repo as well articles to see if I can find a clue to get this to work properly but none of them seems to resolve the issue.p  pI am working on this for almost two days now and none of the solutions are working out for me.

Negative 470 pI have searched all over the internet for about two days now. I have found a lot about how to find the CPU usage using VB and anything in the .NET framework. I am not using the .NET framework so these are irrelevant, I feel.p  pWhat I really need is results similar to the ones shown in the CPU Usage section in a Windows Task Manager under the Performance tab. If I could find a way to mimic that calculation, then that is exactly what I am looking for. I need the percentage of CPU Usage.p  pObviously, Java is not the ideal language for finding the CPU usage of a computer, but that is the language I am using and I have been able to get everything else I need about the computer except this.p  pI am using Windows 7 with Java version 7 update 21. Eclipse is my IDE. p  pThis is my first time posting a question on here, so if I have left anything out or something is not clear, please ask and I will do my best to explain more of what I mean.p

Negative 470 pI noticed a strange behavior in bootstrap dropmenus when the user clicks anywhere outside the dropmenu, any highlighted item that has been clicked on previously looses its highlighting.p  pyou can see that in the following link a hrefhttptwitter.github.iobootstrapcomponents.htmldropdowns relnofollowhttptwitter.github.iobootstrapcomponents.htmldropdownsap  pclicking on the item named Action will highlight it, and then clicking anywhere outside will remove the highlighting.p  pI suppose this is by design  even though I dont understand the logic once I click on an item in a dropmenu I wish it to become deselected only when clicking on ANOTHER item  not outside the menu.p  pAny suggestions as to how to avoid this behavior  Ive tried using stopPropogation on any click  but it doesnt work. p  pThanks p

Negative 470 pAssume I have a list of items each with a weight and I want to pick a random item. The easiest way to implement this is to keep the list of items and a running sum of the weights sorted by the sum. Then pick a random int from the max weight and do a binary search to find the item matching the random value. Not hard to do.p  pThe question is there a more optimal way to choose the item than a binary searchp  pIn my case I have 50,000 items and the weights are in a similar magnitude ints which precludes simply duplicating the items by weight times which makes picking one a simple array reference.p  pI dont need to know how to do this I simply wonder if there is a faster algorithm I may want to do a lot of these so speed may be useful but memory isnt unlimited.p  pIm using C in this case but doesnt have to be in any specific language.p

Negative 470 pI am working on an application that will use mqtt. I will be using the python library. I have been leaning towards using mosquitto but can find no way of programmatically setting access control limits for it. The application Im writing needs to be able to differentiate between users, and only allow them to subscribe to certain topics. The current solution looks like this is done from a config file. Is there a scalable solution to access control limits in mosquitto If not, do you know of a mqtt broker in which this existsp
Negative 470 pLets say Bob is working on branch A, and you want to create your own branch called B, copied from A.  What happens if Bob merges A back into trunk, deletes it, then recreates it again while youre still working on B Will svn freak out when you merge B back into A2  How does svn treat this situation  I couldnt find any info about this in the svn book.p  pemupdateemp  pIm still waiting for an answer about how svn knows what to do here... but if you just want to know if things wont blow up, it looks like they wont.  I tried it myself using svn 1.8, which is pretty new.  It seems to be fineno errors or complaints when I merged the orphaned branch into a new branch they all started from trunk.  I dont know if everything would be fine though in 1.7 where you might make use of codemerge reintegratecode.  Heres a view of the TortoiseSVN log file.  Notice the way the revisions are ordered and arranged.. I guess that shows the way the tree magically works itself out.  The creating fresh dev step is interesting because it happened in a revision later than the A branch modifications rev 5 and 7, yet it the log arranges it like it came before those steps.  Theres definitely some svn cleverness going on. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVF19h.jpg altenter image description herep

Boundary conditions of hemisphere is in the beginning at Tinitial 20 degree room temperature. Externalenviromental temperature is 22 degree. You can imagine that hemisphere is a solid material.

Negative 470 pI have the following query which used to return me counts of machines joined by their barcode. They are joined by the barcode of the line. The problem is that i may have the machine checked on several lines, and I need the last line barcode in which machine was checheckedbr br  example Machine with barcode 882102 was checked at line 99201009. The query will return the exact count of the machines with this barcode on the line, but if the same machine was moved to line with barcode 22212302, the query will give me two rows for each of the lines. I need line 99201009 to be skipped and to get 22212302p  pHere is the queryp  precodeSELECT rountingCode, nameBg, countscanlog.machinebarcode AS count  FROM machines      LEFT JOIN scanlog ON scanlog.machinebarcode  machines.barcode                AND scanlog.linebarcode  barcode  ORDER BY routingCode, nameBg GROUP BY routingCode, nameBG codepre  pI may have mistaken something so here is the original query from codeigniter.p  precodethisgtdbgtselect   rountingCode, nameBg, countscanlog.machinebarcode AS countgt     joinscanlog, scanlog ON scanlog.machinebarcode  machines.barcode      AND scanlog.linebarcode  .barcode,leftgt   orderbyroutingCodegt   groupbyroutingCode, nameBggtgetmachinesgtresult   ScanLog Schema  LogId LineBarcode ScanDate  Machines Schema  MachineId FaNo Barcode Routingcode NameBg codepre  pbr br  br Now the query returns different row for every machine. br  If I set the linebarcode to be 99201009 the query will return different row for every machine which have record in scanLog on linebarcode  99201009br  The problem appears when some machinebarcode was checked on another line and have older checking on other line. In that case the query returns many rows for one machine. I need one row for machine per line. But as  I said if the machine was checked at different lines and the previous record is not deleted the problem will appear and insted of 1 result per machine I will get more.br  Lets say it this waybr  Machine 882102 was first checked at 99201009 three times.br  That means I have 3 of these machines on this linebr  The query will give me codecountcode  code3code br  Everything is okay for now.br  But, when the two of the machines with barcode 882102 are moved on another line with barcode 22212302 the query will give me codecountcode  code2code, codecountcode  code1code, which is wrong for my program.br  I requested line 22212302 so I have to get only codecountcode  code2code.p

Negative 470 h2Summaryh2  pWhy is the following plunkr causing a memory leak every time compile runsp  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coeditHhB4croPKuN5TP2NPqq6httpplnkr.coeditHhB4croPKuN5TP2NPqq6ap  h2Explanation to the codeh2  pI am writing a directive which sometimes needs to completely rerender its HTML. It does this by generating its template as a string, and then feeding that string to compile, finally using jQuery to remove the old DOM and replace it with the newly rendered element.p  pEach time it does this, the application leaks several megabytes of memory, often crashing the browser. The Chrome heap snapshot shows a tree of detached DOM elements gets added each time, but the Plunkr for some reason does not have this issue although it still leaks a lot.p  pWhat am I doing wrong that causes this memory leakp  h2What Generating a string template and recompiling it Whyh2  pThis is clearly not the way Angular directives are meant to be written, I know. My first approach would be a combination of ngrepeats with other twoway binding. Unfortunately, this causes performance issues as the number of watchstatements on the scope increases. For a bit of reasoning as to why I chose this approach, I give a small rant about it here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9682092databindinginangularjs1838183618381836Databinding in angularjsap  h2EDITh2  pI have been working on the plunk, and it no longer leaks memory. Ill keep this question around, in case anyone else finds it useful as a nonleaking method for recompiling DOM.p

Negative 470 pI have a Single Page Application SPA built with DurandalJS v1.2 that integrates with a payment gateway. The SPA will go off to the payment gateways page by doing a normal form POST to their page.p  pOnce the user has finished on the payment gateways page, the payment gateway will then do a form POST back to my SPA.p  pSince its a POST, I handle it server side in ASP.NET MVC by rendering out a require.js module definition for the various form parameters being sent, and this module is then used in the view model that needs to handle the result.p  pThis is all working fine, I handle the result, and then stay on the same SPA page. This is different to the typical web pattern of PostRedirectGet, since the SPA doesnt do any redirects.p  pThe issue now is when pressing the browser refresh button, its bringing up the browsers retry post confirmation dialog which I dont want.p  pIs there a way to avoid this by using JavaScript, or is the PRG pattern the only wayp  pNote It appears that changing window.location, document.location, as well as using history.replaceState all do not work at least in Chrome.p

How to properly implement the codeIDispatchcode methods in a COM serverp  pThe documentation is just panickingly awful, as always. What I have so far readp  ul liIt is better practice to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms22106328vvs.8529.aspxdelegate the codeIDispatchcode method calls to some codeITypeInfocodea. Is this correctli liIf so, how to get an codeITypeInfocode to myself a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms22102728vvs.8529.aspxLoadTypeLiba and family followed by looking at codeITypeLibGetTypeInfocodeli liIf not, how is it implemented properly Links to goodquality documentation and selfcontained examples are of much use.li ul  pThe codeLoadTypeLibcode approach seems appropriate for a COM emclientem to reach type information for some library, not for a COM server trying to introspect itself. Am I correctp
Negative 470 pHow can I listen to value set on a variable or object property without losing other listeners.p  pfor examplep  precodevar myModel myModel  10 var myListener1  functionoldVal, newVal      do stuff  var myListener2  functionoldVal, newVal      do other stuff  codepre  phere I want myListener1 and myListener2 to be called whenever a value is set for variable myModel. Later in other functions might also want to add another listener to myModel on setter so it shouldnt override existing ones.p  pI know there should be a way to do it with Object.defineProperty. Also it would be good to have a solution cross browser for IE8.p

Negative 470 pI am trying to train a SVM Classifier and use the same for Human Detection. I have around 3000 positive and 3000 negative samples to be used for training. HOG Features are used for feature Extraction I am not making use of any OpenCV Code for HOG, rather histograms are calculated using separate piece of C Code. But for training and prediction I am relied on OpenCV SVM.train and SVM.predict classes. When I run the Code, I get the SVM Classifier dumped using SVM.save, but when i use the same for predicting the Images Here i am using the same Images which were used for training i see almost all the Negative Images are falselyclassified as positive.  I even tried varying the CvSVMParams params, but it did not yield me any result.p  pThe params used were  p  precodeparams.svmtype     CvSVMCSVC params.kerneltype  CvSVMRBF params.termcrit    cvTermCriteria CVTERMCRITITERCVTERMCRITEPS, 1000, FLTEPSILON codepre  pAny suggestionsadvice on this would be of great help.p  pThanks in Advance.p

Negative 470 pI am currently running a python application using Tornado Webserver. I use Supervisord to launch 4 Tornado instances on different ports. In front of these I am running Nginx for load balancing between the servers.p  pThe problem is that I have implemented longpolling which means that I need for data to be shared between the different Tornado instances.p  pAs far as I understand, when a user sends a request he gets connected to one of the tornado instances, but the callback is only saved in that single instance and data getting pushed will only be pushed to callbacks on a single instance.p  pHow do I share the callbacks between the instances I have been playing around with Redis, the problem here is how I save the callbacks in the keystore Is there an easier way Or how do I do it in Redisp  pI have been looking at this thread but they dont really give me the full answerp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10361018sharingdatabetweenmultipletornadoinstancesSharing data between multiple tornado instancesap  pThanksp

Negative 470 pIm looking for a good way to anonymize data in my database while retaining the capability of aggregating  summarizing statistical information.p  pAs an example, lets say I want to track clicks by IP address per hour but I dont actually want to store the IP address.p  pMy first thought is to store only a hash e.g. SHA256 of the IP. However, Im not sure this provides sufficient security. If an attacker got ahold of our database and was determined to reverse our anonymization they could generate a rainbow table of IPs and get back the real IP info fairly easily.p  pMy next thought was to add a static prefix to the IP before hashing e.g. code192.168.1.10code becomes codeMYSECRETSTRING192.168.1.10code. Of course, if the attacker finds the static prefix then it is essentially useless.p  pIve been searching for sound solutions to this problem and I havent found anything I really like so far. Are there any well known methods for anonymizing data like thisp
Negative 470 pHi there I hope I am able to explain myself clear enough with this problem I have been really confused about.p  pI have a concrete class called UTModule, it is not subclassed at all, but it is composed of several different abstract objects for example UTListener, UTRenderer, UTDeliverer the instantiation of these abstract classes to concrete objects defines the behaviour of my completed UTModule object.p  pThe question I am asking is that, every example I see for the factory design pattern is in regards to an abstract object that is subclassed, whereas my object is a concrete class whos behaviour is decided by its composition.p  pAm I supposed to create a factory for each of my composite abstract objects Or just create one factory that creates my UTModule, with the correct composite objects depending on the clients requestp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 470 pI am using a hrefhttpmemprofiler.com relnofollow.NET Memory Profilera v4.6 to analyze a dump file created by Windows 7 Task Manager. If I remember correctly the process had about 450 MB memory alloced before dumping it into a file and about 600 MB after it.p  pThe process is running as Windows Service on a longterm simulation, constantly sending data via .NET Remoting. The memory is increasing at about 40MB per hour at full usage. p  pThe Native memory tab shows me a usage of 470 MB private bytes and 130 MB potentially shared. I expect the potentially shared bytes to be generated by the dumping process, so I ignored it for now. The thread stacks are also increasing, but as the thread count stays the same, I expect that memory increase to be finite.p  pA noticable high amount, 450 MB, of that private bytes are filed under Other data. I do not understand what a hrefhttpmemprofiler.comOnlineDocsdefault.htmturlotherdata.htm relnofollowthis definitiona is trying to say me, so can someone explain what Other data is and what could cause this permanently memory increase.p

Negative 470 pIt appears that presenting and dismissing a view controller both prompt the strongpresentingstrong view to layout its subviews andor update its constraints. With a heavy view hierarchy, this is introducing performance issues. Again  this is the existing, currently displayed view. The modal being created and displayed is very light.p  pThis occurs whether I use autolayout as in my example project or not.p  pI have built a a hrefhttpsgithub.combenpackardChildAutolayoutTest relnofollowdemo projecta that approximates an app I am working on. There is a main parent controller with a horizontally scrolling codeUIScrollViewcode. Multiple child controllers are added to the parent controller, and their views are added to the scrollview and arranged using codeNSLayoutConstraintcodes. Each child view has one subview itself, a simple codeUIViewcode, also arranged with a constraint. p  pIn the navigation bar, there is a button to launch a modal. When presented, the parent controller makes a call to codesetNeedsLayoutcode on each child view, multiple times. In my demo project, I am overriding codesetNeedsLayoutcode to log when it is accessed. The same occurs when closing the modal. Open and close the modal a few times and observe the console.p  pI can see no reason why a new layout is needed, and with more complex views I am finding that hundreds of these calls are firing, with a noticeable performance impact.p  pNote that when the layout code from codeChildViewcode is omitted, codesetNeedsLayoutcode is not called. I encourage you to comment out the constraints and see the difference in the logging.p  pWhy is this happening How can I prevent an unnecessary layout pass when presenting and dismissing a modalp

Negative 470 pIt has been my latechildhood dream to create a game, and now as I actually know how I thought I should fulfill my dream and started working on a little game project in my spare time. Its basically a combat type of game where you have up to 3 units, as well as your opponent, and you take turns  since its http, you know that feel  to attack each other and cast spells and stuff. The issue I came across with is with abilities and how to store them. Basically if I were to store abilities in an array it would look something likep  precodeabilities  array     0 gt array         name gt Fire ball,         desc gt Hurls a fire ball at your enemy, dealing X damage.         effect gt functiondata             data[caster]gtdamagedata[target], data[caster]gtmagicPower              ,     1 gt array...  codepre  pBut if I were to store abilities this way, every time I needed to fetch information about a single ability I would need to load the whole array and its probably going to get pretty big in time, so that would be a tremendous waste of memory. So I jumped to my other option, to save the abilities in a mysql table, however Im having issues with the codeeffectcode part. How can I save a function into a mysql field and be able to run it on demandp  pOr if you can suggest another way to save the abilities, I may have missed.p

Negative 470 pIve set out to handle tls operations manually on a websockets server, due to the cockeyed way php supports listening on secured transports.From RFC6455p  blockquote   pIf secure is true, the client MUST perform a TLS handshake over the   connection after opening the connection and before sending the   handshake data [RFC2818].  If this fails e.g., the servers   certificate could not be verified, then the client MUST emFail the   WebSocket Connectionem and abort the connection.  Otherwise, all   further communication on this channel MUST run through the encrypted   tunnel [RFC5246].p blockquote  pAccording to this, the first thing I should receive is the clientHello message which signifies the beginning of a TLS handshake.But all I receive on the server is the websocket handshake request, encrypted.

Negative 470 pMy new PC has a Core i7 CPU and I am running my benchmarks, including newer versions that use AVX instructions.

When xtra is 16 or less, the benchmark produces 24.4 GFLOPS. CPU runs at 3.9 GHz, so result is good at 6.25 calculations per cycle, compared with maximum of four multiples and four adds. Increasing xtra to greater than 16, produces 2.6 GFLOPS.

Negative 470 pIm using the latest version of LuaJit and need some help getting started. What I need is to have a bunch of functions exposed to the Lua environment which can be overridden inside the scripts to run the users supplied code, these functions would then be called during set events from within Cp  pFor example, when the user presses their TAB key down it would call a function from the lua environment such as OnScoreboardOpen and when the user releases their TAB key it would call the corresponding function OnScoreboardClose these functions could be attached to a metamethod like Game or GM.p  pCould someone point me to some tutorials or sample code showing how this can be accomplished Thank you very much for your time.p

Negative 470 pI want to use the memory profiler of the visual studio 2013 ultimate for profiling a WPF application.

I have tried the solution of this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15421201howdoirunthevisualstudio2012memoryprofilerimgettingtheerrorda000How do I run the Visual Studio 2012 memory profiler Im getting the error DA0002a, but the part with the VSPerfCmd does not really work got the message that i should use the VSPerf.exe, but this did not work either.p  pI think that this is not a problem with the VS2013 in general, but with my project. The mentioned project on which this problem occurs is a WPF application. It includes an asynchronous socket server based on the codeSocketAsyncEventArgscode.p  pI cleaned the solution, set debug to x86, removed all unused references of the project and set the target framework from .net4.5 to .net4. Nothing changed. I have no idea why the memory profiling does not work. Maybe the buffers of the sockets are the fault of this as they are not managed by .netp

Negative 470 pI have a codebase for a graphics program in cljx that gets compiled to Clojure and ClojureScript.p  pI now want to introduce my first macro.p  precodedefmacro optionalstyledprimitive [args body]     let [extra conj args style]       fn extra gtSShape style body           args gtSShape  body              codepre  pThe purpose of this macro is to take a list of arguments, and an expression that uses those arguments to generate a geometry. And to return a function with two arities  one of which takes an optional style parameter. This macro is then to be used within the file where its defined, to make a number of other functions that optionally take styles. For example p  precodedef square optionalstyledprimitive [n] [[0 0] [0 n] [n n] [n 0]] codepre  pBut introducing this macro, obviously, breaks the ClojureScript stage of the compilation.p  pWhat I cant figure out is what to do about it. The online discussions talk about ClojureScript needing to use coderequiremacroscode but I never actually export or require this macro anywhere. I just want to use it where its defined. So how can I, in the middle of a file, tell the compiler to use Clojure to expand this macro, before it gets to the ClojureScript compilerp

Negative 470 pI have made an embedded script with UI designed to show in a dialogue to allow a controlled, dynamic, interaction with a set of underlying spreadsheets.  While I seem to be able to get it to work with open permissions I would now like to set protection on the underlying sheets so all modification is through the dialogue.p  pAfter some research I hear it is not possible as the scripts will run with the users permissions, meaning no protection or no script.  I have read it is possible to convert to a web app which can be set to use the owner permissions.  This would work as the only reason to access the underlying sheets is to use filtering to analyse or search them reference onlyp  pUnfortunately the documentation on how to do this is very poor.  I understand I need to have a doGete and doPoste function but there is no record of the functional contract, what these need to be able to do or when.  There is no information on if it is even possible for a web app to be able to access the sheet data as if it were embedded I know I can turn embedded into web app, but not if it will workp  pall the functions I need to work are strongly coupled to my spreadsheet.  the direct calling functions are intended to be called from menus, and the few other open functions I have are just to create the menus.

Negative 470 pI have 3 x,y points that I am trying to use to draw a right trangle.  So I am calculating the angles of the triangle after calculating side lengths.

Negative 470 pAccording to its man page, the a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman2select.2.html relnofollowselecta system call offers monitoring of three different aspects of one or more file descriptors whether they are ready to read from, ready to write to, or whether an error or exceptional condition language varies has occurred. Which of these shall be monitored, is specified via three codefdsetcode arguments referred to as codereadfdscode, codewritefdscode, and codeerrorfdscode. While there is plenty of good documentation and examples about the proper use of codereadfdscode and codewritefdscode, I could hardly find anything useful on codeerrorfdscode.p  pAnyhow, for reasons discussed below, I gave the use of codeerrorfdscode a try, and did indeed find a few circumstances, in which the codeselectcode call in my runloop responded to an exceptional condition on one of its file descriptors. For example, a TTY connected to a PTY, while the latter is being closed from its master side, raises such a condition.p  pBut now what I know that some exceptional condition occurred on a file descriptor, but how, in general, can I find out what exactly caused it Just looking at codeerrnocode certainly does not give the answer at that point it is always 0. Is there perhaps some magical codeioctlcode that I should be aware ofp  pstrongSome further backgroundstrong A number of my programs mostly written in C communicate with external hardware via serial ports. For testing, I also wrote a simple server that creates a PTY to whichs corresponding TTY my other programs can connect to as if it was a serial port. While at a basic level all of this is working pretty well, handling of errors or other exceptional conditions is currently not really implemented at all, which occasionally leads to pretty nasty behavior. This needs to changep  pOne exceptional condition, that I am particularly interested in detecting, is whether a connection has been broken. For example, it would be nice to notice when a port goes away, say, because the user pulled a USBtoserial adapter. Properly handling read and write errors seems to avoid the nastiest of unintended side effects, but I was wondering if there was more watching codeerrorfdscode, or perhaps some other signals that I should be doing. Unfortunately, UNIX signal handling is something I am not at all familiar with.p

Negative 470 pI am developping an Android application which is supposed to manage a simple TCP connection through the codeSocketcode class. However, due to the fact that we cannot use network on the UI thread, I have to detach all network communication to a separate thread.p  pBasically, I havep  ul liMy activity, the layout of which contains a codeTextViewcode. The codeTextViewcode is suppose to hold the connection log messages I send, and those I receive from the server.li liMy codeRunnablecode connection class, to which I associated a socket, and a few others methods to handle message reception. Everything in there runs in a separate thread.li ul  pNow, the tricky part is connecting the two. Since the messages do not arrive on the same thread as the UI runs, I cannot update the UI from the network thread. If I do, I get an expectable...p  precodeCalledFromWrongThreadException Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views. codepre  pNow, this means that instead of sending the messages to the codeTextViewcode, I should wait for them in the Activity. Basically, in my codeonCreatecode...p  precodepublic void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      private MyConnectionClass connection      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState       Set up the activity, the UI listeners, and so on...     TextView myTextView  TextViewfindViewById ...

Basically, codewaitForMessagecode blocks until a message is received, and returns it when it arrives.p  pHowever, the problem here is that the waiting is done on the UI thread, and since Im in codeonCreatecode, my activity hangs and never shows up.p  pIve tried a few solutions such as the codeObservablecode class and the codeObservercode interface, but it does not eliminate the problem, since codenotifyObserverscode is called by the network thread, meaning that the UI update done in codeObserver.updatecode fails codeCalledFromWrongThreadExceptioncode.p  pI also tried waiting on another thread started by the activity, but quickly realised I would get the result as above... Besides, Im not sure I really need to create again another new thread.p  pConsidering that the UI thread is the only one which can modify the codeTextViewcode, and since I cannot really afford to freeze my UI, is there a way I could have my network thread update the UIs codeTextViewcode asynchronously when messages arrivep

Negative 470 pI have searched across entire SO. for similar or exact topic and I couldnt find or didnt saw topic on issue thats bothering me. If this is duplicate, and solution already exists, accept my apologies. p  pCurrently I am working on cms application that uses both codemirror and ace editor, either this one or that one, and that depends on useroperator preference which one is going to be fired up once when particular document is loaded.p  pWith codemirror, I have no issues at all.

Negative 470 pRuby on Rails 4.1.4p  pI made an interface to a Twitch gem, to fetch information of the current stream, mainly whether it is online or not, but also stuff like the current title and game being played.p  pSince the website has a lot of traffic, I cant make a request every time a user walks in, so instead I need to cache this information.p  pCached information is stored as a class variable streamdata inside class Twitcher.p  pIve made a rake task to update this using cronjobs, calling Twitcher.refreshstream, but naturally that is not running within my active process to which every visitor is connecting to but instead a separate process.

Negative 470 pIn Go, how can I encode a float into a byte array as a 16 bit unsigned float with 11 explicit bits of mantissa and 5 bits of explicit exponentp  pThere doesnt seem to be a clean way to do it.

For example, 1 microsecond is represented as 0x1, which has an exponent of zero, presented in the 5 high order bits, and mantissa of 1, presented in the 11 low order bits.  When the explicit exponent is greater than zero, an implicit highorder 12th bit of 1 is assumed in the mantissa.  For example, a floatingvalue of 0x800 has an explicit exponent of 1, as well as an explicit mantissa of 0, but then has an effective mantissa of 4096 12th bit is assumed to be 1.  Additionally, the actual exponent is oneless than the explicit exponent, and the value represents 4096 microseconds. Any values larger than the representable range are clamped to 0xFFFF.p blockquote

Negative 470 pI have an amchart in a div whose showhide is managed by angularjs. Sometimes it charts data thats already in memory. When that is the case, the div opens, chart is rendered and the SVG in there has a width of 10. As a result the chart does not appear on screen. Resize the window a mite and the chart appears because amcharts is listening to resize events I guess. This I think is a known issue  I have seen some SO posts on them and I hope one of them will work for me. My suspicion is that the angular machine does not get cycles to run open the div before amcharts gets to draw its magic just a hunch no solid evidence.p  pNext, I added an event watcherp  precodepiechart.writedivs.chartdiv.attrid divs.chartdiv.onyes, snowy, function  same with shown,resize     console.info woah   codepre  pNow a strange thing happened. I see the following error stack in my consolep  precodeError [jqLiteonargs] jqLiteon does not support the selector or eventData parameters httperrors.angularjs.org1.3.13jqLiteonargs at REGEXSTRINGREGEXP httplocalhost8100libionicjsionic.bundle.js876212 at jqLiteOn httplocalhost8100libionicjsionic.bundle.js1173339 at Object.JQLite.anonymous function httplocalhost8100libionicjsionic.bundle.js1195117 at Object.makePieChart httplocalhost8100commonservicesgraphinghelperService.js52834 at obj.controller.scope.myExt.renderFunc httplocalhost8100directivesboxRenderers2.js17924 at renderit httplocalhost8100modulesdashboarddashboard.js24630 at scope.showBox.deferred.promise.then.workarea.showChild httplocalhost8100modulesdashboarddashboard.js31017 at processQueue httplocalhost8100libionicjsionic.bundle.js2188827 at httplocalhost8100libionicjsionic.bundle.js2190427 at Scope.get.Scope.eval httplocalhost8100libionicjsionic.bundle.js2310028 codepre  pemAnd that funky behavior is goneem  The chart appears if I click to redraw it out of cached data, hides when click again, and all good.

Negative 470 pIm trying to find an codeOnlogncode sorting method to sort several arrays simultaneously so that an element in a multivalue array will represent elements from 4 different single value arrays and the sorting method would sort the multivalue elements.p  pFor examplebr For a given 4 single value arrays codeAncode, codeBncode, codeCncode and codeDncode, Id set a new array codeQncodebr so that codeQ  [ A B C D ]code.br codeQcode may be changed during the process so that codeQ  [ Aa Bb Cc Dd ]codebr where codeacode, codebcode, codeccode and codedcode are index listsbr and of course that codeQ  Q  [ Aa Bb Cc Dd ]code so that codeAa  Aacode, codeBb  Bbcode and so on. The motivation is to use SIMD intructions of course to benefit from this structure to separately sort the 4 arrays.p  pI tried to use a SIMD comparer codemmcmpltpscode for example and a masked swap codemmblendvpscode for example to make a modified version of traditional sorting algorithms quick sort, heap sort, merge sort etc but I always encounter the problem that in theory there appear to be codeOnlogncode steps in the decision tree. And so, a decision, whether if to set a pivot quick sort or whether if to exchange a parent with one of its children heap sort is not correct for all of the whole 4 components all together at the same time and thus, the next step  go right or left  is incorrect.p  pFor now i only have codeOncode methods working.p  pAny ideasp

One of my users says I should use XML markup and create the markup like codeltrequirementgt THE REQUIREMENT HERE ltrequirementgtcode.p  pIm not sure what is the correct approach. The driving factor for me is that the actual tag not the content between the openingclosing tags be hidden when looking at the screen in the browser window.p

My current uploading function looks something like thisp  pFiles name emtestupload.phpemp  precodedir  pathtodirectory tempFile  FILE[file][tmpname] tagetFile  dir.FILE[file][name] moveuploadedfiletempFile, targetFile codepre  pWhere codeFILEcode is a file being uploaded.p  pPlease disregard any syntax or spelling error in the code above, it works perfect at the moment. I have removed a lot of code to give a simplistic idea of what my code is currently doing.p  pIf any configuration changes to PHP are to be made, they need to target this directory specifically as the rest of our website needs to stay on the current port. I am not exactly sure where to begin with specifying the ports to be used for file transfers. The file transfers are purely client to server and will never be viceversa. We do have an FTP server setup however if possible, wed like to remain off of it. I am not sure if what I am asking is possible otherwise.p  pI am using the Dropzone.js plugin from here a hrefhttpwww.dropzonejs.com relnofollowhttpwww.dropzonejs.coma, however all the PHP code is mine.p  pI am not sure if something like the code below from a hrefhttpwww.ewhathow.com201309checkifatcpportlikehttpport80isopenusingphp relnofollowherea is the way to go, Ive never used the fsockopen function before.p  precodefp  fsockopenhost, port, errno, errstr, timeout   responding  1 if fp  responding  0    tend  microtimetrue  fclosefp codepre  pAll answers are welcome.

Obviously restarting the device while the app is still open is not a good practice, but this will happen once in a while and I want my records to still be there.p  pAny ideas Thanksp

With this technique, tokens will be valid for a reasonable period of time without being fixed.li liPrevent users from altering data youve sent them in a session by sending a session digest hash of the data that uses a salt along with the session data.

Negative 470 pI have encountered with one issue with compareAndSet of AtomicBoolean class. I cannot post my code in this forum. But I will explain the scenario. p  blockquote   p1 I have Two mutual exclusive features of one functionality.p      p2 Both feature have their own cap i.e. a user can use the feature for X number of times only. For example sake, assume that user can use first feature 4 times and second feature 2 timesp      p3 First feature is enabled for 50 minutes of the hour i.e. second feature is disabled during that timep      p4 Second feature is enabled in last 10 minutes of the hour i.e first feature is disabled during that timep      p5 Both these features are using same AtomicBoolean attribute in progress. This boolean will check users earlier request is in progress or not. If users earlier request is in progress, it will show message  Your request is already in progress and boolean will be marked as true. Once his request is processed, the boolean will turn to false. A user can rerequest the feature only when in progress is false.p      p6 During switch over from first feature to second feature, a particular user got issue. User used first feature for max cap. Now he is trying to use second feature but got a message Your request is already in progress even though it is first request for accessing second feature.p blockquote  pThis happens only when AtomicBoolean is not reset by first feature. The application ran fine for over 3 months but I have received complaint from one user.p  pOn receiving user request, I got a doubt on AtomicBooleans compareAndSet method usage. Is there any possible bug with this API Have you ever encountered any issues with this API I have not encountered any exceptionserrors in log filep

Negative 470 pI am using a offcanvas bootstrapjasny nav.  What I am trying to do is switch out a class on a icon based upon if the div has the canvasslid on it.  I was wondering if this can be done with NGCLASS based on if a Class exist on a parent .  Here is a fiddle a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netf3mgacy48 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netf3mgacy48a with the code based on jQuery.  the only issue with the jQuery is when you click anywhere it hides the nav, but doesnt change the icon.  So I would like to know if you can do this with NGCLASS if not how would you do it with jQuery.p  precodelta idfilterLink datatoggleoffcanvas dataplacementright datatarget.filtermenugtltspan idfilterIcon classglyphicon glyphiconfilter textwhitegtltspangtltagt  ltdiv classoffcanvas filtermenugt     Offcanvas fly in filter... ltdivgt codepre
