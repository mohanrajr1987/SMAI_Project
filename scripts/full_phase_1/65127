Positive 65127 pi have set up a node js server and socket.io with redis.  If im creating a http server everything works fine, but i switched to https requests and socket.io has a problem with polling. It does continuously polling and i dont get it why...via http it does not polling continuouslyp  psee here it counts up to 10000 a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comZH2aV.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comZH2aV.pngap  pI have this problem only if i use https...and i dont get it why he is doing that.p  pHere is my server.jsp  precodevar app      requireexpress var https    requirehttps var fs       requirefs var io       requiresocket.iohttps var redis    requireredis    var options     key fs.readFileSyncxxxxxx,   cert fs.readFileSyncxxxxxx   https.createServeroptions, function req, res   res.setHeaderAccessControlAllowOrigin, httpsxxxxxxxxxxxxx.at res.setHeaderAccessControlAllowHeaders, Origin, XRequestedWith, ContentType, Accept res.setHeaderAccessControlAllowHeaders, ContentType res.setHeaderAccessControlAllowMethods, PUT, GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS res.setHeaderAccessControlAllowCredentials, true          res.statusCode  200   res.endhello worldn   console.loghi .listen3389, xx.xxx.xxx.xxx    io.onconnection, function socket     console.lognew client connected   var redisClient  redis.createClient   redisClient.subscribemessage     redisClient.onmessage, functionchannel, notification      console.logmew notifications in queue  notification  channel     socket.emitchannel, notification       socket.ondisconnect, function      redisClient.quit      socket.onreconnecting, function      console.logadsasd     codepre  pAnd here is my client codep  precodevar socket  io.connectltphp echo envSOCKETCONNECTURL gt, secure true          socket.onmessage, function data              handleNotificationsdata             updateNotifications          codepre  pSo my question is, why is socket.io polling continuously and what is wrong with my code or do i unterstand something wrongp  pPs.

Positive 65127 pI have a test rig set up that attempts to create two sockets between the same client and a backend server. With debugging turned on, I can see the xhr open GET requests for two different sockets AAAA, and AAAB and the corresponding socket receive messages with type open and the datas sid echoing the socket id AAAA or AAAB. Ive highlighted these in the trace below. However, these both occur before the socket.onconnect... function is called so the socket.io.engine.id reflects only the 2nd sockets request and that method appears to get called twice. If I were to guess, the lookup is seeing the URI ending in  that was used for both connections and is reading the latter as if it cant distinguish between two outstanding calls. I am maintaining the channelName shown in an object that performs the io.connect so I can trace which socket is being called back.p  pI would hope this part of the trace might show what occurred  I havent found where the subscriptions are managed to understand how it looks up which listener to all... Both io.connect calls one for NatA and one for NatB use the same URI and port and both use forceNew set to truep  precode            console.logthis.channelName Connecting to   uri

Positive 65127 pHi Im writing a game with codenode.jscode, codesocket.iocode, and codecanvascode and was wondering how to validate packets properly. Im under the impression that users can use a packet injection program to send packets that the server isnt expecting. For example,p  ul liSend a packet with one of the parameters outside of normal bounds x or y beyond game spaceli liSend extremely large packets to overwhelm the serverli liSend a packet with additional parameters the server is not expectingli liSend a packet with data that, when read, may execute commands on the server escape charactersli liSend the same packet over and over to overwhelm the server DoSli ul  pWhat are the typical measures taken to prevent such things Are some of the bullets not an actually issue Am I missing anything Are there any libraries to assist in any of thisp

Positive 65127 pIm trying to figure out how to use socket.io alongside of my reactredux application, and seeing how much I can optimize when doing so. So, on the server I have a pretty basic setup with the sockets you can see here  p  precodestore.subscribe gt      io.emitstate, store.getState.toJS   io.onconnection, socket gt      socket.emitstate, store.getState.toJS     socket.onaction, function action          action.headers  socket.request.headers         store.dispatchaction       codepre  pSo the only thing out of the ordinary is I was just sticking the request headers onto the actions for use later. What I would like to try and achieve is something like this p  precode io.connections[i].emitstate codepre  pand addp  precodesocket.onstate, action gt      socket.emitstate, getUserSpecificStatestore  codepre  pThe idea is this would allow me to loop through all the connections, and then use that connections socket to call for the specific user at the time. I dont know if something like this is possible, and am looking for some possible feedback in handling sending back only user specific information back. It would also be cool to only send back the part of the state changed by the action and not the whole state, and then have the front end store assemble the state. Anyall input is more than welcomed, thanksp

Positive 65127 pIm making an online whiteboard app with codesocket.iocode just for fun and learning and Im trying to decide between these two options for the drawing toolp  p1 Wait for around 20 points or until mouseup and send that points array all at once over the wire. The effect on the clients will be they will only see line paths updated every 20 or so points.p  p2 Send each point as soon as it is drawn as a packet. This will result in around 20x more packets being sent but the responsiveness will be immediate on all clients.p  pIm not sure which option is better. Im worried that if I do the second option that the server will be overburdened by all the point packets but ideally it would be better just because it would be so responsive and look so pretty but Im unsure of how feasible it is considering the quantity of the packets required to be sent back and forth.p

Positive 65127 pI am developing an application using Socket IO that needs to be scaled across multiple servers. This is being achieved through socket.ioredis, which essentially interconnects all of my servers running socket IO and treats Redis as a datastore that all of my serversnodes running Socket IO publish messages from.p  pFor better context, here is a diagram from MSDN that outlines my setupp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commqkp3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commqkp3.png altsocketio setupap  pHeres my issuep  pIf Client A sends a message only intended for Client C to receive, I feel its a waste of bandwidth to publish a message to Client B and D. My idea is that I would, on the serverside, record user ids and their corresponding open socket ids. Then when a client sends a message, I would do do a lookup and find a users socket ids and publish the messages. This seems fine and dandy as well as heavily reliant on a robust system to keep that table of user ids and socket ids up to date, but there are two questions I have about implementing this systemp  p1 Is it more memory efficient to emit messages to only relevant socket ids, rather than to an entire channel across every server I realize that with 4 total clients, this problem is very small, but imagine if I had 2000 concurrent users across 2 servers. If 1 client sends a message intended for 2 clients, I imagine sending a message to 1997 other clients is more taxing than sending to just those 2 socket ids, unless io.sockets.connected[socketid].emit is not efficient. Example belowp  precodesocket.onchat message, functionmsg     io.emitchat message, msg  codepre  pvs.p  precodefor i  0 i lt relevantsockets.length i       io.sockets.connected[relevantsockets[i]].emitchat message, msg  codepre  p2 Since Im using multiple servers, are socket ids guaranteed to be unique Im hoping the redis module is handling this since its entire purpose is to link processes and servers, but I just want to be sure.p  pThanks ahead of time for any help.p

Positive 65127 pWe are trying to build a web application whose data updates in realtime. In order to do this we were thinking to use socketio.p  pSo the plan wasp  ol liA socket requests updates for a certain entitytype say users perhaps because it is displaying a list of users on the screen. li liCheck permissions of socket by using the userId and assuming that it is allowed to see users add it to a users room.li liWhen another client changes the users view Update, Insert or Delete emit an event to the users room with the updated user attached.li ol  pHowever, we have run into a problem that we have not been able to solvep  pHow can we possibly know if another view has changed Since our application pulls from views which are calculated objects, if a client updates viewA, it is totally possible that a row in viewB has changed as well due to them sharing underlying tables. If there is a second client socket in the viewB room, it will not get its updated viewB entity and will go out of sync with the db.p  pEven if we stored in session a hash of views to underlying tables and used it to predict which views may have changed on update, we still wouldnt know which row specifically had changedp  pLooking for ideas or approaches, all thoughts welcome. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 65127 pI am using Laravel as backbone of my web project. I want to create a notification system like the Facebook does for messages and notifications at the top. After reading, I found out that I can achieve what I try to do with Socket.io. However, I couldnt perfectly understand how to setup the logic.p  pLets say there will be different types of notification types, such asp  ul liUserX started following you,li liUserY wrote on your wall,li liUserZ sent you a messageli ul  pFirst, as far as I understand, the socket.io setup on client side [codeio.connectcode] should be called on every page master.blade in my case. On the server side, when a user connects to the server, it requires channel and message parameters to complete communication cycle.p  pHere is where I get confused. How is the logic works for my case I can understand the logic of public chat use, but couldnt figure out for notification system.p  pIs it like are all these sending notification info data function supposed to be triggered when inserting it to database with unique channel name maybe UID and preset messages for predefined actions eg. UserX started following youp  pBy that, I am planning to use Bootstrap dropdowns and appending the notification data in that dropdown with javascript.p
Positive 65127 pThe socket server doesnt handle any logins or any inputs from the user, it just delivers information TO the user from a mysql database when it becomes available. Having not worked with socket.io before I dont know what things I should look out for when developing with it. For example can someone access the contents of the .js server Because mine contains some sensitive data like sql credentials.p

Is it possible to use Socket.IO as a signalling server to discover who is available, and who to start a voice chat with, and then establish a peertopeer connection between two devices in order to transfer audio data p  pNOTE Although I would prefer peertopeer, because I would like to avoid overloading the server with transferring such an enormous amount of data, is it possible to have socket.io receiving and transmitting audio data between devices because I heard that iOS and Android cannot establish a P2P connection with one another.

Negative 65127 pAs far as I know theres no way to hint the c compiler to inline a particular function and I guess its like that by design.p  pI also think that not letting the programmer to specify what to inline and what not is generally a good idea, as it would imply that you think youre smarter than the JIT compiler my respects to those who actually are, but, what if I wanted to specify that a critical portion of code needs to be extremely fast at any cost, no matter how to achieve it on the target machine As of yet you cant do such a thing and I wonder if both the c language and the JIT will ever support this feature.p  pIn my case, I know what the target machine is, and I know that function inlining will help improve the performance. This leaves me thinking that the only way to enforce function inlining is getting to know under what circumstances the JIT will do it but I dont think thats a good idea either,p  pAny light on the subject would be much appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 65127 pHeres the scenariop  pMy users are presented a grid, basically, a stripped down version of a spreadsheet.  There are textboxes in each row in the grid.  When they change a value in a textbox, Im performing validation on their input, updating the collection thats driving the grid, and redrawing the subtotals on the page.  This is all handled by the OnChange event of each textbox.p  pWhen they click the Save button, Im using the buttons OnClick event to perform some final validation on the amounts, and then send their entire input to a web service, saving it.p  pAt least, thats what happens if they tab through the form to the Submit button.p  pThe problem is, if they enter a value, then immediately click the save button, SaveForm starts executing before UserInputChanged completes  a race condition.

This may be higher or lower depending on the users computer speed.  p  pDoes anyone have any ideas how to handle this condition  A coworker suggested using a semaphore while the validation code is running and a busy loop in the save code to wait until the semaphore unlocks  but Id like to avoid using any sort of busy loop in my code.p

Negative 65127 pIm trying to wrap up a two day beat down on Abstract methods and return type Covariance, Ive already posted two similar questions and I am eternally grateful to the community for the info provided, I just need one last push to get to the finish line.

I cant even get a string from the DB into a memo field in ClientDataSet.p  pThe ClientDataSet is a part of my data tier so I will need to conform the data from the DB to the ClientDataSet field by field well most will be able to go right through, but many will require routing andor conversion.p  pDoes anyone have experience with thisp

Negative 65127 pIm trying out a hrefhttpwww.winhost.com relnofollowWinHosta and Im running into some issues with subdomains. On WinHost, you can have multiple subdomains per hosting account, but each subdomain points to the root website. E.g. you can have www.example.com, sub1.example.com, and sub2.example.com but all of them display the content at a hrefhttpwww.example.com relnofollowhttpwww.example.coma.p  pOther Hosts allow you to point subdomains to a sub folder in your website. This would allow you to point sub1.example.com to sub1, sub2.example.com to sub2 and www.example.com to . p  pWinHost recommends using an a hrefhttpsupport.winhost.comKBa649howtoredirectasubdomaintoasubdirectory.aspx relnofollowaspaspx pagea to redirect a hrefhttpsub1.example.com relnofollowhttpsub1.example.coma to a hrefhttpsub1.example.comsub1 relnofollowhttpsub1.example.comsub1a, which points to sub1.

Negative 65127 pHas anyone heard of this error beforep  pI have a Java 5 application, that uses Hibernate 3.3.2 to access an Oracle Database 10g, the JDBC driver is the Oracle light driver version 10.2.0.4.0 the most recent version, I think. The database access happens during a transaction that is managed via the AOPtools of spring. There is one database table mapped to one Java entity, the mapping is done via annotations. There are two attributes in this entity that are CLOB in the database. They are annotated according to JPA with Lob and are Java Strings. Everthing works fine unless both attributes have values with more than 4000 characters After the commit the values are switched on the database, that is attribute A contains the value of attribute B and vice versa.p  pThis is not a joke   p  pThe Eclipse debugger tells me that the Java entity has the correct values until the transaktion closes I did not debug into the spring transaction handling. This error does not occur if both Clobs are annotated with the Hibernate annotation Typetype  clob in which case they have to be of the type java.sql.Clob and not String, of course.p

What is the best practice to achieve this using Java Servlet API p  pIve considered the following optionsp  ol lipUsing longterm HttpSession sessions and storing user identifier as an attribute of the session. This approach doesnt permit user to restart browser, because JSESSIONID cookie is not persistent and there is no standard way to change its properties.

[2] [2]  ...     [3]  [3]  ...     [4]  [4]  ...     ...  ... codepre  pso yes F, is a descendant of C.pli ul  pThis test seems to be worst case On, where n  maximum prefix length  maximum tree depth, so its worst case is exactly equal to the obvious way of just going up the tree and comparing nodes. However, this performs much better if the tested node is near the bottom of the tree and the potential parent node is somewhere at the top. Combining both algorithms would mitigate both worst case scenarios. However, memory overhead is a concern.p  pIs there another way for doing that Any pointers greatly appreciatedp

Negative 65127 pI have a Silverlight 4.0 application and its corresponding Styles.xaml for each of the theme. I know what code to write to change the ResourceDictionary and all. Basically I need a conceptual idea from you. I have a query string in my URL like codeuid3code. The themes are users based. So A can have a theme different than B. As far as I know, if you have implicit styles defined, you can write the code to change the theme anywhere in your application and it will work out just fine. However, if your resource dictionary defines explicit styles then you have to compulsorily set the theme in App.xaml.cs constructor. Let me know if I am wrong Now the problem with this is the user may browse As profile and then may shift to Bs. If this happens the theme wont be changed because App.xaml.css constructor runs only once when your application starts. How do I handle this One option is to never create explicit styles and keep all of them implicit. Do you guys have any other optionp  pSecond question is as the theme keeps changing as user browses the page, do I need to keep making a webservice call to retrieve what theme applies to this specific user This will make a huge performance hit as you make an extra webservice call in every page. Is this acceptable or do you have any other better optionp  pP.S One other solution is I create a base page and in that page store a previousUserId. If the currentUserId fetched from query string doesnt match the previousUserId, I make a call to see which theme this specific user has set for his profile and after webservice call, make codepreviousUserId  currentUserIdcode so next time call wont be made as long as the user is on this userIds profile. But yet another problem with solution is the page will load all its data with old theme as long as the response from the webservice to get the new theme doesnt come. This looks buggy. Eg. The user first visits As profile so his theme will be fetched from webservice and applied. Then he visits Bs profile but the theme will be still As until the asynchronous call to get Bs theme returns.p  pHow do you handle all of these stuff Let me know if I am not clear.p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 65127 pI have a script that I run which does a lot of tasks and goes through about 21k times. The problem is for each index I am doing several different things, each index is a product in our database, I am updating the price by grabbing data from a API and saving the product and so on. I have several areas where I have put calls to codememorygetusagecode before and after almost every method call, and everyone that I do have seems to increase the memory. There isnt one that is doing more than the others or its not that noticable.p  pI have tried to unset all my variables at the bottom of the loop as well as trying to just set them to null, but no matter what the memory limit just keeps raising through each iteration.p  pIs there anything I can do to clear this memory up, I would think unsetting the variables were suppose to free up the memory but it doesnt seem to do sop  pEDIT I forgot to mention the reason why I started to investigate this is that I am getting memory limit errors on the server. It doesnt always happen at the same point or even happen everytime it is ran. That is why I tried to investigate it. p  pThe script takes about an hour to run, I run it in the morning when nothing else is going on and right now it is only on a staging server anyway so there really isnt anyone hitting the server. p  pI can post the code but its pretty bigp  precodeltphp   if functionexistsmemorygetusage      includefunction.php  echo At the start were using in bytes ,

Negative 65127 pMostly, my confusion seems to be eminating from my attempts to understand security within the context of WCF.

This mostly stems from my understanding of https, in which case only a certificate issued to the server and chained to some certificate issued by a root CA would be necessary to establish an encrypted connection and authenticate the server.li ol  pIm not entirely sure this is the correct forum.  My questions stemmed from trying to understand WCF, but I guess I would like to understand the theory behind this in general.  If its a good idea, please suggest the correct forum for me.

Negative 65127 pThough I am quoting this in context of Borland C application, but the question is both specific for Borland as well as generic in nature.p  pIn a Borland C project, I observe that a user interaction with the GUI say a menu item click is taking less priority than a task delegated to the main thread using Synchronize, even though the user interaction is happening a few milliseconds earlier. When the main thread is available, the delegated task is done first and then the action corresponding to the user interaction is performed. A worker thread delegates a task to main thread and waits for the task to complete using Synchronize. So we can equate Synchronize to SendMessage.p  pI believe that the user interaction queues up as a message in the message queue and same should be the case with the delegated task. But how does the task execute first Is there any priority between messagesp

Negative 65127 pI want to code a little Game, dealing with fonts and letters. I want to make them move arround in 2d space and i am using box2dweb as physics engine, what is actually doing a very great job. At the moment all I am struggling with, is the problem of building the b2Body for a Letter. Box2d can only handle primitive, convex shapes and to build an more complex hitbox I have to combine some of them. In the image I tried to figure out what i would like to reach, an algorithm, that takes an svgpath of a letter and generates a series of b2shapes which represent the hitbox.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeL7Cv.png altcapital letter A in Black, a series of b2Shapes in blue, with green strokep  pAll in all i have no Idea where i could find some Information about this, if there is a library that is capable of doing this. Even if this Library is not available in Javascript, i could do the job on Server. I know that there is paper.js and raphalel, some clever vector libraries, but i have not found any hint how to solve this yet. I would be happy for any kind of help, links to ressources, or the correct name of the problem in mathematical sense.p  pGreetings and thanks in advance... Philippp

Negative 65127 pIm making a game in C where is a tank that can moves on a stage. The tank has an angle float, in degrees, and im supposing the tank is at 0 when his cannon points to the right, a speed float, and there is a time constant called deltaT float.p  pWhen the player moves the tank forward, I use trigonometry and the physic equation of position in function of time I mean Xt, i dont know how it says in english in order to calculate the new tanks coordinates in the stage.p  pThis is my problem due to the passage from float to int, the values closest to zero are not taken into account. So, at certain angles, the tank appears rotated, but moves in a different direction.p  pThis is what my code doesp  p1  first, I separate the speed in its components X and Y, by using the angle in wich the tank is movingp  precode    float speedX  thisgtspeed  costhisgtangle     float speedY  thisgtspeed  sinthisgtangle codepre  p2  then use the equation I mentioned above to get the new coordinatesp  precode    thisgtx  int ceilthisgtx  speedX  deltaT     thisgty  int ceilthisgty  speedY  deltaT codepre  pThe problem begins at the first step at certain angles, the value of the cos or the sin is very close to zero. So, when I multiply it for speed to obtain, say, speedX, I still got a very low number, and then when I multiply it for deltaT it is still too low, and finally when apply the ceil, that amount is totally lost.p  pFor example, at 94, with deltaT  1.5, and speed  2, and assuming initial value of X is 400, we havep  precodespeedX  0.1395... thisgtx  400 it must be 399.86..., but stays in 400 due to the ceiling codepre  pSo, in my game the tank appears rotated, but moves straight forward. Also, sometimes it moves well backwards but wrong forward, and viceversa.p  pHow can I do to make the direction of the tank more accurate To raise the speed or the value of deltaT are not options since its about a tank, not a formula 1 Pp

Im sort of guessing that you have one Application module that does the routing and the global stuff, injecting dependencies and what not and then other modules for the different stuff like game, account, guestbook, forum etc.p  pOnce Ive figured it out I can make a Github example application of it as I know other people are curious about it.p  pEdit  24112011 Ive since come across a post by EvanDotPro on the contributor forum about them talking about them not wanting to do the ZF1 modulecontrolleraction way of doing things and that there wasnt that much demand for it.

Negative 65127 pIm developing a Rails app with a lot of dependencies on external APIs, for example Delicious.  All APIs share two workflowsp  ul liOn the first call they are going to load all data since the beginning of time.li liAll following calls will load data filtered by the last execution time if supported.li ul  pTesting them in real means I must create a test account for each API or at least use my private one. Even with a hrefhttpsgithub.commyronmarstonvcr relnofollowcodeVCRcodea, because they would be called once. And my biggest problem I would have to mess around a lot with codeDatecodes and codeTimecodes to emulate the two different workflows mentioned above. Though a hrefhttpsgithub.comjtrupianotimecop relnofollowcodeTimecopcodea makes it really easy, it feels like a pain in the ass.p  pAnother approach is to fake the API calls and their corresponding responses completely, but this means no real tests and furthermore I would never realize changes or problems with the APIs.p  pAny suggestions Maybe a good combination of both waysp

Negative 65127 pIm trying to combine the capability of doing image zoompanning  inside of a Gallery view. The problem is controlling which touch  events are processed by each. In a horizontal drag on the image, the  ImageView needs to process the drag in order to pan, up until the edge  of the image is reached then the gallery view needs to process the  touch event so that it can swipe over to the next photo.  It seems that if I return false from the imageviews ontouchevent,  then I wont be notified of the panningdrag move events.  What I tried to do was return true from the imageviews ontouchevent  until the edge of the image was hit then return false. However I  believe that this doesnt cause the Gallery to begin processing these  events, as it missed the initial touchdown event.  My next thought is to somehow turn the containing activity into the  touch handler, and somehow stop the Gallery and ImageView from getting  touch events normally, and have the activity forward the touch events  manually. Not sure if this is possible or if there is an example.  My last resort will be to simply not use the android.widget.Gallery,  which I want to avoid because I want the widget to feel the same as  other places on the phone, and I like code reuse. Unfortunately I  might have to do this, as I see all other apps that have this zoompan  capability dont seem to use the Gallery widget Gallery3D etc.  My question is, whats the best way to design for this situation where  motionevents need to split between two views Any ideas would be  greatly appreciated thank you.p

Negative 65127 pEverything I read about expires headers httpwww.stevesouders.comblog20080823revvingfilenamesdontusequerystring, eg indicates that when taking advantage of caching in this manner, you need to fingerprint your file names so that when your static assets change, the browser will stop using the version from cache and instead fetch the new one.p  pHowever, in my tests with IIS7 as the backend webserver, and using IE 7, FF, and Chrome browsers, I did not need to do so. If I changed the file on the webserver  something like myfile.js, then the webserver sent the last modified header as that files date of modification, and the browsers all picked up on that change. They returned a 200 for the first request after changing the file and subsequent requests appeared to pull from cache.p  pSo surely Im missing something, but I dont know what it is.  Please enlighten me.p

Negative 65127 pMy game is using the SkinnedModel pipeline and AnimationPlayer to load and display models.  Ive implemented ray picking with triangles by building a list of vertices and indices from the pipeline. This works, however the indices are static are only work for the initial pose of the model seeing as it walks, arms moving back and forth, its not quite good enough since the picking sees the model in one position onlyp  pIve changed it to ray picking with triangles by getting the vertices and indices at runtime, which is then able to transform the vertices by the boneTransforms given from the AnimationPlayer.

But there must be a pretty simple test to determine this, is basically drawing on a canvas with an image and seeing if you get an exception when you try to get image data, or is there any other easy way to determine this.p

Negative 65127 pWe have an app with highly interrelated data, i.e. there are many cases where two objects might refer to the same object via a relationship.  As far as I can tell, Django does not make any attempt to return a reference to an alreadyfetched object if you attempt to fetch it via a different, previously unevaluated relationship.p  pFor examplep  precodeclass Customer Model      firstName  CharField maxlength  64      lastName  CharField maxlength  64   class Order Model      customer  ForeignKey Customer, relatedname  orders  codepre  pThen assume we have a single customer who has two orders in the DBp  precodeorder1, order2  Order.objects.all print order1.customer  1 One DB fetch here print order2.customer  2 Another DB fetch here print order1.customer  order2.customer  3 True, because PKs match print id order1.customer   id order2.customer   4 False, not the same object codepre  pWhen you have highly interrelated data, the degree to which accessing relationships of your objects results in repeated queries of the DB for the same data increases and becomes a problem.p  pWe also program for iOS and one of the nice things about CoreData is that it maintains emcontextem, so that in a given context there is only ever one instance of a given model.  In the example given above, CoreData would not have done the second fetch at 2, because it would have resolved the relationship using the customer already in memory.p  pEven if line 2 was replaced with a spurious example designed to force another DB fetch like codeprint Order.objects.exclude pk  order1.pk .get customer  order1.customer code, CoreData would realize that the result of that second fetch resolved to an model in memory and return the existing model instead of a new one i.e. 4 would print True in CoreData because they would actually be the same object.p  pTo hedge against this behaviour of Django, we are kinda writing all this horrible stuff to try to cache models in memory by their codetype, pkcode and then check relationships with the codeidcode suffix to try to pull them from the cache before blindly hitting the DB with another fetch.  This is cutting down on DB throughput but feels really brittle and likely to cause problems if normal relationship lookups via properties accidentally happen in some contrib framework or middleware that we dont control.p  pAre there any best practices or frameworks out there for Django to help avoid this problem  Has anyone attempted to install some kind of threadlocal context into Djangos ORM to avoid repeat lookups and having multiple inmemory instances mapping to the same DB modelp  pI know that querycaching stuff like JohnnyCache is out there and helps cut down on the DB throughput however there is still the issue of multiple instances mapping to the same underlying model even with those measures in place.p

Negative 65127 pFrom my knowledge strings are 1 based in Delphi, 0 position is reserved for the length. I am in charge of an huge application written in D5 and D2006, which is using the copy function by copying from the 0 index, and several colleagues are also coding in this way in this moment. Because this is a Delphi magic function, I believe that even if Copy is used to copy the string from 0 index, behind the scenes it copies it from the position 1. p  pFor me a good practice is to copy a string from the 1st position, not from the 0 position, even the result is the same. p  pNow, my question is, can be the application affected when passing to other Delphi version by using the copy function from 0 position instead of be used to copy from 1 positionp

Negative 65127 pIm working on a modularized Java Web app. The dependencies between the modules visible tier and the businessdatabase tier is resolved by gradle. So technically, my database only needs to hold tables for the entities, that are actually used by the deployed visible modules. But this may lead to potential trouble when I want to migrate the database in the production environment. So, other than creating the database schema from the dependencies, I see two optionsp  p1 I always have a single schema for all available entities. My actual database therefore holds the tables for all entities, even the ones not used by any of the deployed modules. This makes migration in a production environment very easy, but clutters up the database and the folders that hold the entities during development.p  p2 I have several independent schemas, which are logically separated. Each schema will result in a database on the server. Which schemas are needed, is resolved by the module dependencies. I migrate every schema for itself. So migration will still be manageable. p  pThe server for the databases would look like thisp  ul liMySqlServer ul liAuthorizationDatabase ul liUserTableli liRoleTableli liUserRoleRelationshipTableli ulli liBlogPostDatabase ul liPostTableli liCommentsTableli ulli ulli ul  petc..p  pHowever, I dont know if the idea of many smaller databases instead of one monolithic database will lead to potential trouble. Especially in regards of performance.p

Negative 65127 phaving real problems with a very unresponsive OSX app. When using about 3K Core Data objects, the app freezes during startup and save, and when adding new managed objects.p  pWhen I dig into the call tree, using Instruments Time Profiler, most of the time seems to be spent sorting array controllers. During startup, half of the time goes to NSUndoManager, which observes notifications while array controllers are setting their content...p  pIs the array controller sorting while new managed objects are being instantiated Do I need to put sorting on hold Could NSUndoManager be the culpritp  pMore importantly, how does one go about analyzing something like this It could very well be that I have some sort of exponential sorting going on, by which I mean that when one array controller sorts itself, several other array controllers may needlessly start resorting themselves too. p  pThe datamodel I am using is fairly extensive.

Negative 65127 pIve got a simple problem, but somehow fail to solve it properly p  pI would like to test the primality of long long integers 64bits. The primality requirement comes from the mixing of several hash values if not respected, there is some kind of echo in the resulting output, which degrades the distribution property of the hash formula.p  pIve got a few interesting candidates, but cannot test at this stage their primality.p  pIve found a website which proposes just that  input a number, and it provides the next value which is prime. The problem is, this website only works for values within the 32 bits range limit.p  pIve been roaming SO for the same question, and it was asked several times already. However, all answers ive been consulting up to now only points towards methods and algorithms such as miller rabin, or AKS, carrying a hidden doityourself tag.p  pAnd thats not what im looking for. I do not need to test primality regularly every day from now on, or for a huge numbers of candidates. I just have this need now, and for a very limited number of candidates. Therefore a Readytouse tool which answer just this question preferably, an online one, would better fit the bill.p  pBut does that exist p

Negative 65127 pIve written a small application as a test to see what Excel VSTOs are capable of. However, Ive run into a problem.p  pWhen I start Excel my clipboard is cleared. Ive traced this down via Google to be a problem with AddIns specifically COM addins that when not initialized correctly will clear the clipboard automatically. Unfortunately for me I dont know how to preserve the clipboard in a VSTO and Google isnt much help. I dont call any functions that would obviously clear the clipboard. The only thing in the ThisAddin function is an ifelse block that reads from some properties and sets some flags.p  pIve mulled over the idea of copying data on the clipboard to some object and then just replacing this but that seems very hacky and probably wont work.p  pCan anyone shed some light on howwhy my VSTO clears the clipboard when Excel starts and how I can remedy it p  pEDITp  pAfter tracing a little bit deeperI was wrong about it being my person test addin. I figured out that it was either the Team AddIn or Adobe Contribute. Given Adobes track record with these things I would go ahead and say it was probably the contribute addin. Thanks everyone for your replies. This will teach me for using a nonvanilla installation of Excel for VSTO practice.p  pstrongI will leave this topic open so that more people can contribute to possible reasons why a VSTO Excel AddIn or any AddIn for the office suite would clear the clipboard on start.strongp

Negative 65127 pId like to be able to use jQuerys Deferred object to operate loading data via Backbone Collections and Models.  Is there any way I can modify the arguments provided to the done and fail callbacks to include the Model or Collection instance  Im envisioning something like the followingp  precodevar sync  Backbone.sync  Backbone.sync  function      var jqXhr  sync.applythis, arguments      var self  this     return jqXhr.pipefunction          var cbArgs  [self]         cbArgs.push.applycbArgs, arguments         return cbArgs         ... var c  new Backbone.Collection c.url  pathtoresources c.fetch.thenfunctioncollection, data, textStatus, jqXhr       do stuff with collection  codepre  pOf course, since filter is returning an array, the done callback is invoked with an array, rather than the enumerated arguments.  As far as I can see, pipe can only modify provided arguments, not add.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.p  pEdit  This is a very simplified example since a closure is created over the original collection, I could just operate on that.  However, the use case is that multiple Backbone Views might rely on the same data being fetched, so Id like to be able to just supply the jQuery Deferred object to these views, rather than both the Deferred and the collection instance.p  pAnother Edit  Posted a solution below, but any other suggestions welcome.p

Negative 65127 pOk, so I have a small animation of snowflakes falling on the screen, and I used codesetTimeoutcode to make it move. I love the way it looks so far on Chrome at least, and right now, Im working on crosscompatibility, and Im looking at Firefox, and its moving extremely slow. To be honest, the codesetTimeoutcode function is set to 5ms, and it only moves 1px every 5 ms a speed of 200 fps, but I need it to go at that speed. Is there some sly hack to get around it, and what speed is Firefox making the function repeat at Also, sidenote it doesnt even work in IE9 I dont care about lt8.

Negative 65127 pIve just started using a hrefhttpseleniumhq.orgdocs03webdriver.htmlWebDrivera, and Im trying to learn the best practices, in particular using a hrefhttpcode.google.compseleniumwikiPageObjectsPageObjectsa and a hrefhttpcode.google.compseleniumwikiPageFactoryPageFactorya.p  pIts my understanding that PageObjects should expose the various operations on a web page, and isolate the WebDriver code from the test class. Quite often, the same operation can result in navigating to different pages depending on the data used.p  pFor example, in this hypothetical Login scenario, providing admin credentials takes you to the AdminWelcome page, and providing Customer credentials takes you to the CustomerWelcome page.p  pSo the easiest way to implement this is to expose two methods which return different PageObjects...p  h2Login PageObjecth2  precodepackage example  import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement import org.openqa.selenium.support.FindBy import org.openqa.selenium.support.PageFactory  public class Login       FindByid  username     private WebElement username      FindByid  password     private WebElement password      FindByid  submitButton     private WebElement submitButton      private WebDriver driver      public LoginWebDriver driver         this.driver  driver           public AdminWelcome loginAsAdminString user, String pw         username.sendKeysuser         password.sendKeyspw         submitButton.click         return PageFactory.initElementsdriver, AdminWelcome.class           public CustomerWelcome loginAsCustomerString user, String pw         username.sendKeysuser         password.sendKeyspw         submitButton.click         return PageFactory.initElementsdriver, CustomerWelcome.class        codepre  pAnd do the following in the test classp  precodeLogin loginPage  PageFactory.initElementsdriver, Login.class AdminWelcome adminWelcome  loginPage.loginAsAdminadmin, admin codepre  porp  precodeLogin loginPage  PageFactory.initElementsdriver, Login.class CustomerWelcome customerWelcome  loginPage.loginAsCustomerjoe, smith codepre  h2Alternative approachh2  pInstead of duplicating code, I was hoping there was a cleaner way of exposing a single codelogincode method which returned the relevant PageObject.p  pI thought about creating a hierarchy of pages or having them implement an interface so that I could use that as the return type, but it feels clumsy. What I came up with was the followingp  precodepublic ltTgt T loginString user, String pw, ClassltTgt expectedPage     username.sendKeysuser     password.sendKeyspw     submitButton.click     return PageFactory.initElementsdriver, expectedPage  codepre  pWhich means you can do the following in the test classp  precodeLogin loginPage  PageFactory.initElementsdriver, Login.class AdminWelcome adminWelcome       loginPage.loginadmin, admin, AdminWelcome.class codepre  porp  precodeLogin loginPage  PageFactory.initElementsdriver, Login.class CustomerWelcome customerWelcome       loginPage.loginjoe, smith, CustomerWelcome.class codepre  pThis is flexible  you could add an ExpiredPassword page and not have to change the codelogincode method at all  just add another test and pass in the appropriate expired credentials and the ExpiredPassword page as the expected page.p  pOf course, you could quite easily leave the codeloginAsAdmincode and codeloginAsCustomercode methods and replace their contents with a call to the generic codelogincode which would then be made private. A new page e.g. the ExpiredPassword page would then require another method e.g. codeloginWithExpiredPasswordcode.p  pThis has the benefit that the method names actually mean something you can easily see that there are 3 possible results of logging in, the PageObjects API is a bit easier to use no expected page to pass in, but the WebDriver code is still being reused.p  pstrongFurther improvements...strongp  pIf you did expose the single codelogincode method, you could make it more obvious which pages can be reached from logging in by adding a marker interface to those pages this is probably not necessary if you expose a method for each scenario.p  precodepublic interface LoginResult   public class AdminWelcome implements LoginResult ...  public class CustomerWelcome implements LoginResult ... codepre  pAnd update the login method top  precodepublic ltT extends LoginResultgt T loginString user, String pw,      ClassltTgt expectedPage     username.sendKeysuser     password.sendKeyspw     submitButton.click     return PageFactory.initElementsdriver, expectedPage  codepre  pEither approach seems to work well, but Im not sure how it would scale for more complicated scenarios. I havent seen any code examples like it, so Im wondering what everyone else does when actions on a page can result in different outcomes depending on the data p  pOr is it common practice to just duplicate the WebDriver code and expose lots of different methods for each permutation of dataPageObjectsp

In the strongproperties  c build  settings  gcc c compiler  symbolsstrong I  creqated an entry and put MYOPT in as the value.p  pWhen I compile I get error 127 saying that DMYOPT cannot be found.  I learned that error 127 means it realy came from bash and, after a bit of thought, I realized that since the dash is not there as in DMYOPT bash indeed would report that there is no input file named DMYOPT to be found.p  pI searched google and stackoverflow and found lots of similar questions, but cant formulate one with narrow enough search terms to fine any remotely related answer, so I hope someone here can help.p  pNOTE  I removed the SYMBOL and instead put a DMYOPT in the miscellaneous field.

Negative 65127 pI have a solution already, but its messy and could use some tweaking.

Negative 65127 pIm relatively new to iOS programming and have been making a recipe based app for the iPad.

So, it looks like I will be making 140k API calls.p  pRight now, I have a file with 140k rows of properly formed JSON, waiting to be imported into Parse.p  pI have tried doing this with curl in PHP on my webserver. I got 510k objects imported before the script stops running. I tried adding this to the PHP filep  precodeignoreuseraborttrue settimelimit0 codepre  pBut this didnt work. So I thought maybe Id have more control in Javascript, again 510k objects imported before crashing. I added a timeout pause every 50 objects, and it still crashed. Ive tried waiting for a success response before making the next API call, or running them all concurrently, and it doesnt make a difference.p  pAnyways, my question is how to most efficiently make 140k REST API calls, without crashing.p
Negative 65127 pstrongMy problemstrongp  pI am porting my application from version 1.x to 2.0 of the DataNucleus plugin for GAEJ using the new 1.7.5 GAEJ SDK. This changes my JDO version from 2.3 to 3.0.1. My persistent entity class has a primary key of type encoded string, along with readonly access to the objects numeric ID. Each instance is the sole member of its entity group children and parent are linked by numeric ID only.p  pPreviously, I have been able to create and persist a new codeMyEntitycode instance and then immediately access its numeric ID to store in the parent codeMyEntitycode instances list of child IDs.p  pNow I find that the new instances numeric ID is not available immediately after persistence  even though it is generated and stored and is available later.p  pstrongMy questionstrongp  pIs there anything I can do to restore access to the numeric ID immediately following object creation and

Negative 65127 pIm trying to debug a problem in our ASP.Net application, whereby the first page access can take up to five minutes.  This site runs in .Net 3.5 and has 100 ascx controls and 25 aspx pages, so its not small.p  pWhat Ive noticed is that when the site is really slow to load the Temporary ASP.Net files folder is being repopulated.  Fully loaded and running that folder is  50 to 70 MB total, with anywhere from 20003000 files in it.p  pIm a little confused as to how and when that folder is cleared out  Starting from scratch with an empty folder the site takes 5 minutes to load.  But under regular recompilations, maybe a file or two changed, the site comes up in 30 seconds after a rebuild.  p  pWhat I dont understand is when the folder is cleared out sometimes even after I run a clean and rebuild all on the solution, with an iisreset and web.config change thrown in for good measure, that folder has nearly the same number of files as before when the site reloads and it only takes 30 seconds to come up.  We are using the optimizeCompilations flag in web.configp  pOther times, under other build circumstances I cant explain, were back to the 5 minute load times as the folder completely rebuilds itself.  p  pWhen is this folder cleared out and is there anything I can do to speed up its repopulation time when it needs to start from scratch  70 megabytes in 5 minutes seems a little slowp

Negative 65127 pI am looking to get more control over the validation process of liferay aui components so that i can put in some custom code to handle things such as error event tracking for web analytics.  This question is related to my earlier question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16401634howcanliferayalloyuivalidationerrorbecapturedforwebanalyticshow can liferay alloy ui validation error be captured for web analyticsa.  After some more research i have discovered that custom javascript validators can be implemented using the codeauivalidatorcode tag but what i would need is a way to delegate the validation to the original javascript handle, a kind of a codesupercode call so to speak.  This would ensure that i would be able to leverage all the existing validation functionality existing within aui while being able to add my own logic for analytics.. Admittedly, this is not preferable as i would have to put in this logic in a lot of places in every JSP but at least i will have a solution for what essentially is a critical blocker for me right now.p  pI am keeping this as a separate question as this question is more pointed towards custom validations and a lot of people looking at this even for things other than web analytics would find this useful.p  pLooking forward to some guidance from the community...p

Negative 65127 pI have discovered the hard way that if a file has a valid UTF8 BOM but contains any invalid UTF8 encodings, and is read by any of the Delphi 2009 encodingenabled methods such as codeLoadFromFilecode, then the result is a completely empty file with no error indication. In several of my applications, I would prefer to simply lose a few bad encodings, even if I get no error report in this case either.p  pDebugging reveals that codeMultiByteToWideCharcode is called twice, first to get the output buffer size, then to do the conversion.  But TEncoding.UTF8 contains a private codeFMBToWCharFlagscode value for these calls, and this is initialized with a codeMBERRINVALIDCHARScode value.  So the call to get the charcount returns 0 and the loaded file is completely empty.  Calling this API without the flag would silently drop illegal code points.p  pMy question is how best to weave through the nest of classes in the Encoding area to work around the fact that this is a private value and needs to be, because it is a class var for all threads. I think I could add a custom UTF8 encoding, using the guidance in Marco Cantus Delphi 2009 book. And it could optionally raise an exception if codeMultiByteToWideCharcode has returned an encoding error, after calling it again without the flag.  But that does not solve the problem of how to get my custom encoding used instead of codeTencoding.UTF8code.p  pIf I could just set this up as a default for the application at initialization, perhaps by actually modifying the class var for codeTencoding.UFT8code, this would probably be sufficient.p  pOf course, I need a solution without waiting to lodge a QC report asking for a more robust design, getting it accepted, and seeing it changed.p  pAny ideas would be very welcome.  And can someone confirm this is still an issue for XE4, which I have not yet installedp

Negative 65127 pI created a private git repository for a project for a while back, and developed a pattern of creating a maintenance branch for each major version release. p  pA few months down the line in the project, I now have a number of branches for old versions, which are no longer under any form of support.

Negative 65127 pThe problemp  pIn my simulink model, I have a bus creator that will send all the signals to a block. The block purpose is to make a selector and a switch dynamically based on an index. Example  I have 3 objects, each with a position and a velocity signal, and I want to get the position of the 3 objects, so 3 signals this means the bus selector will have 3 output and the multi switch will have 4 one for the index. The block is working correctly, with a recursive function script called in the callback, it checks the bus for all possible signals and count the number of objects, and modifies the bus selector and the switch accordingly. The problem is that this block is linked to a library, so I have to disable the link in order for the callback script to work.p  pThe questions p  ol liWhat should i change in order to avoid disabling the link  li liIs there another way of making dynamic wiring and dont use a callback scriptli ol

Negative 65127 pIm quite new to Hibernate and have been trying to determine what it will do for you and what it requires you to do.  p  pA big one is dealing with an object that has dependants that dont yet exist in the database.  For example, I have a Project object that includes a Manufacturer field that accepts a Manufacturer object as its value.  In the database I have a products table with a mfrid column thats a reference to the manufacturers table a fairly typical unidirectional onetomany relationship.  p  pIf the manufacturer assigned to the product object relates to one thats already in the database then theres no problem.  However, when I try to save or update an object that references a manufacturer that hasnt been persisted yet, the operation fails with an exception.  p  blockquote   pException in thread Application org.hibernate.TransientObjectException object references an unsaved transient instance  save the transient instance before flushingp blockquote  pI can of course manually check the state of the products manufacturer by seeing if its ID field is null and saving it if it is, but this seems like a cumbersome solution.  Does Hibernate support automatically persisting dependants if the dependant in question isnt yet persisted  If so, how do I enable that behaviour  Im using the version of Hibernate bundled with Netbeans 3.5, I believe and inline annotations for specifying the mapping behaviour.  Below are my product and manufacturer classes, cut down to the parts that handle the dependency.

Negative 65127 pI have a C routine MyClassmyFunctionchar  message. which returns a message by writing in the message buffer. This routine is exported to python via SWIG. When the routine is called, I assume that the char  points to a python allocated memory area associated to the string.p  pNow, the a hrefhttpwww.swig.orgDoc1.3SWIG.htmlSWIGnn25 relnofollowSWIG documentationa says that modifying the contents of this buffer is a baaad idea, which makes sense because strings are supposed to be immutable. So the question now is what is the proper way of dealing with this casep

Negative 65127 pMultiple developers work on a project and each developer has different paths to dependencies, compiler etc. At the moment, all developers share a codeSConstructcode file.

Negative 65127 pI have a JSON with lots of data. Now all the fields does not have fixed types of data every time. For example some codeIdscode are some time appearing as perfect integer, like code123code, but some time it appears as codeStringcode, like codea123code. p  pBy default, codeindex.mapper.dynamiccode is codetruecode. So type mapping is automatically defined as per data received for first time for indexing codeWhile creating the index for first set of JSON datacode. Now lets say, my first set of data is having codeIdcode value as code123code, so type of codeIdcode is mapped as codeIntegercode. So when some data have codeIdcode as codeStringcode, like codea123code, then it is throwing exception, as the type is mapped to codeIntegercode.p  pWe can turn off dynamic type mapping by puttingcodeindex.mapper.dynamic falsecode in codeelasticsearch.ymlcode. But it will disable type mapping for all fields. I want to have codePartial Type Mappingcode. For some fields, like codedatecode, I would like to have type mapping for codedatetimecode in specific format.p  pSo my goal is to achieve type mapping only for few fields of JSON data. So if there are 20 fields in JSON, I bother for types of 4 fields, for other 16 fields if they are considered as String, I am OK with that.p  pIs there any way I can achieve such partial type mapping  I am using Java client.p

Negative 65127 pi have a question on iOS7 and the Custom UiViewControllerTransistion. I want to make a custom transistion between a fullscreen UiCollectionView and a modal View iPad with the details of the selected item on the collectionView. The animation should be like that when you tapped on a item in the collection the item will scalezoom to the final Position of the Modal View with the details, and when you tapped then outside the modal view, the modal will be dismiss automatically. The dismiss animtion should be a kind of reverse animation. It should seems to be that the modal view falling back to the item in the UICollectionView. The transistion is the like in the Apple Podcasts App on the iPad, when you select a Podcasts and it will show you the details of Podcats in a kind of Modal View. I hope you can understand what i meanp  pSo i have no idea if its only a custom transistion or if i need a custom uicollectionviewlayout for it. It would be nice if you can explain what i have to do for it. p  pxxAvarlonxxp

Im confident that it is possible since Boost 1.55 officially supports Visual Studio 2013 msvc12.0 and there have only been few breaking changes between the two releases.p  pMy motivation is that I need some features of the CTP so my own application will be compiled with the CTP version of the msvc compiler. Im afraid that simply compiling Boost with the original 2013 compiler will cause binary incompatibilities between Boost and my own application. a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comSeriesC9LecturesStephanTLavavejCoreCCoreCpp10 relnofollowStephen T. Lavavej himself doesnt guarantee binary compatibilityap  blockquote   p any chance of reusing Boost Binaries built for MSVC 2013 in MSVC Nov 2013 CTPp      pBecause this is compileronly, you can probably get away with mixingandmatching.

Negative 65127 pI need to be able to temporarily persist data that isnt fully validated yet, then enforce validation when Im ready to make it permanent. But Angular is preventing that. p  pI have a form. The user can codesaveDraftcode on early versions of the form, which are persisted to the server. Then, when the user is ready, they can codesubmitcode the form, which will persist it with different flags, thus beginning the actual processing of that data.p  pThe problem Im running into is with Angulars builtin validations. When a user enters some data into an input with validations on it, that data is cached on the codeviewValuecode property. But if validation fails, its never copied to the codemodelValuecode property, which is a reference to the actual codescopecode property I bound the input to. And hence the invalid value will not be persisted. p  pBut we need to persist it. Well deal with forcing the user to correct their validation failures later, when they submit. Also, we have no way to know whether the user is going to codesaveDraftcode or codesubmitcode on a particular instance of the viewcontroller, so we cant setup the views and validation differently beforehand.p  pMy thinking is that we need to somehow iterate the form elements and get Angular to somehow let the data go through. But I cant find a way thats flexible and scalable. p  pIve tried setting codescope.formName.inputName.modelValue  scope.formName.inputName.viewValuecode, but that seems to just upset the gods, as both values are then nulled. p  pIve tried using codescope.formName.inputName.setValidity, truecode, but that only updates the UI state. It never touches codemodelValuecode. p  pI can successfully use codescope.model.boundPropertyName  scope.formName.inputName.viewValuecode but that feels very imperative and wont allow any variance between the identifiers for codeboundPropertyNamecode and codeinputNamecode. In other words, you either need individual functions for all form controls, or you need to rely on naming conventions. Both of which are superbrittle.p  pSo... how can I get that codemodelValuecode updated elegantly AndOr, is there another, better way to obtain the same results, whereby sometimes I can persist with validation, and sometimes persist withoutp  pOther options Im considering, but not happy with p  ul liRun validation manually, only when the user hits submit. But that defeats the UX value of instant, inline validation in the UI. We might as well just offload all the validation to the server and do a roundtrip each time. li liMake copies of ngModel and ngModelController, and monkeypatch them to update codemodelValuecode regardless of validity. But that hacks the framework when there should be a more elegant path. li ul  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ioxmlilleypengtKaySee CodePen herea.p  pSidenote Angular appears to be filtering the data according to the validator in emboth directionsem. If you set a default value on the model for formData.zip of 1234, which isnt enough characters to validate, Angular doesnt even show it. It never reaches the initial codeviewValuecode.p

Negative 65127 pHey so I have about 50 spiders in my project and Im currently running them via scrapyd server. Im running into an issue where some of the resources I use get locked and make my spiders fail or go really slow.

Negative 65127 pIve set the value NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription in my .plist file to add a customized message to the bluetooth enabled alert message.

Negative 65127 pI have marker locations saved in a database with lat, lng, type, and timestamp. My current code loads all markers displaying different Icons depending on their type, but when I use the setInterval function they all reload again. One solution that was suggested to me was to add a variable that checks the timestamp on the first successful load and updates it each time, so when the function is triggered again it will only load markers added after that time. However Im not sure how I would go about adding this in to my current code. Any helpsuggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 65127 pI would like to use a domain name to point to a web page on the local servers IP address. However, the problem is that the page is linked to an IP address set up on port 8088 rather than 80 because the latter is already used by another web page. By the domain company I was told that they cannot do it because the domain can only point to an IP address set up on port 80. So now I am in a deadlock. What alternatives do I have and how can I make a domain pointing to the IP8088p  pThanksp

Negative 65127 pI have a peculiar problem. I have a website that is maintained using MCMS 2002, and I recently deployed an update involving some images, changes to config file, an updated Flash file and its corresponding xml file. onto the server. The live site is updated fine. However when I go to the edit site, the changes that I see on the live site is no longer there  the Flash file hasnt been updated.p  pThis only happens with the Flash file and xml the culprit could be one, or both of these files, other images and files that got updated both by replacing the file directly using File Explorer on the server machine, and through the CMS showed up on the edit site just fine.p  pIve cleared the cache on my browsers, used incognitoinPrivate modes, and the problem still persists.p  pHas anyone who have used this system have any clues as to how to fix it The only idea I have is that the edit site is somehow cached on the server side. On the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms964276.aspx relnofollowMicrosoft Content Management Server 2002 Frequently Asked Questionsa page, it says MCMS improves performance through caching. If this is the culprit, anyone knows how to clear it There are no options on the CMS itself that I can find.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I have reset the IIS, went to codeCProgram FilesMicrosoft Content Management ServerServerTempcode to delete temporary files, and found only two image files and an code.sdocode file, deleting them yields no results.p

Negative 65127 pI am working on sparse reconstruction using a calibrated stereo pair. This is the approach I have taken step by stepp  p1 I Calibrated my stereo cameras using the Stereo Camera Calibrator app in MATLAB.p  p2 I Took a pair of stereo images and Undistorted each image.p  p3 I Detect, extract, and match point features.p  p4 I Use the triangulate function in MATLAB to get 3D coordinates of the matched points by passing the stereoParametes object into triangulate. The resulting 3D coordinates are with respect to the optical center of camera 1 Right camera and it is in millimeters.p  pThe problem is that the point clouds seems to be warped and curved towards the edges of the image. at first it seemed like a barrel distortion of the lenses to me. so I recalibrated the bumblebee XB3 cameras using MATLAB camera calibrator app. but this time I used 3 radial distortion coefficients and also included tangential and skew parameters. but the results are the same. I also tried Caltechs camera calibration toolbox but it had the same results as MATLAB. the radial distortion coefficients are similar in both toolboxes. also another problem is that the Z values in the point cloud are all negative but I am thinking that might be coming from the fact that I am using right camera as camera 1 and left camera as camera 2 as opposed to what MATLABs coordinate system is in the link attached.p  pI have attached couple of pictures of 3D point cloud from both sparse and dense 3D reconstruction. I am not interetsed in Dense 3D but just wanted to do it to see if the problem still exist which it does. I believe that means the main problem is with the images and camera calibration rather than algorithms.p  pNow my questions arep  p1 What is the main reasonreasons for having warpedcurved 3D point clouds is it camera calibration only or other steps may introduce error as well how can I check on thatp  p2 Can you suggest another camera calibration toolbox besides MATLABs and Caltechs maybe one that is more suitable for radial distortionsp  pThanksp  pImagesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC0qmN.jpg altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7pvHU.jpg altenter image description herep  pLinksp  pa hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpvisiongscoordinatesystems.html relnofollowcoordinate systemap  pCodep  precodeclear close all clc  loadmystereoparams.mat I11  imreadRight.tif I22  imreadLeft.tif figure, imshowpairI11, I22, montage titlePair of Original Images  [I1, newOrigin1]  undistortImageI11,stereoParams.CameraParameters1 [I2, newOrigin2]  undistortImageI22,stereoParams.CameraParameters2 figure, imshowpairI1, I2, montage titleUndistorted Images   Detect feature points imagePoints1  detectSURFFeaturesrgb2grayI1, MetricThreshold, 600 imagePoints2  detectSURFFeaturesrgb2grayI2, MetricThreshold, 600   Extract feature descriptors features1  extractFeaturesrgb2grayI1, imagePoints1 features2  extractFeaturesrgb2grayI2, imagePoints2   Visualize several extracted SURF features figure imshowI1 title1500 Strongest Feature Points from Image1 hold on plotselectStrongestimagePoints1, 1500  indexPairs  matchFeaturesfeatures1, features2, MaxRatio, 0.4 matchedPoints1  imagePoints1indexPairs, 1 matchedPoints2  imagePoints2indexPairs, 2   Visualize correspondences figure showMatchedFeaturesI1, I2, matchedPoints1, matchedPoints2,montage titleOriginal Matched Features from Globe01 and Globe02   Transform matched points to the original images coordinates matchedPoints1.Location  bsxfunplus, matchedPoints1.Location, newOrigin1 matchedPoints2.Location  bsxfunplus, matchedPoints2.Location, newOrigin2  [Cloud, reprojErrors]  triangulatematchedPoints1, matchedPoints2, stereoParams figureplot3Cloud,1,Cloud,2,Cloud,3,b.titlePoint Cloud before noisy match removal xlabelX, ylabelY, zlabelDepth Z in mm   Eliminate noisy points meanmeanmeansqrtsumreprojErrors . 2, 2 standdevstdsqrtsumreprojErrors . 2, 2 errorDists  maxsqrtsumreprojErrors.2,2,[],14  validIdx  errorDists lt meanmeanstanddev tt1findCloud,3gt0 validIdxtt10 tt2findabsCloud,3gt1800 validIdxtt20 tt3findabsCloud,3lt1000 validIdxtt30  points3D  CloudvalidIdx,   figureplot3points3D,1,points3D,2,points3D,3,b.titlePoint Cloud after noisy match removal xlabelX, ylabelY, zlabelDepth Z in mm  validPoints1  matchedPoints1validIdx,  validPoints2  matchedPoints2validIdx,   figure showMatchedFeaturesI1, I2, validPoints1,validPoints2,montage titleMatched Features After Removing Noisy Matches   get the color of each reconstructed point validPoints1  roundvalidPoints1.Location numPixels  sizeI1, 1  sizeI1, 2 allColors  reshapeim2doubleI1, [numPixels, 3] colorIdx  sub2ind[sizeI1, 1, sizeI1, 2], validPoints1,2, ...     validPoints1, 1 color  allColorscolorIdx,    add green point representing the origin points3Dend1,  [0,0,0] colorend1,  [0,1,0]   show images figureunits,normalized,outerposition,[0 0 .5 .5] subplot1,2,1 imshowpairI1, I2, montage titleOriginal Images   plot point cloud hAxes  subplot1,2,2 showPointCloudpoints3D, color, Parent, hAxes, ...

How can I get the full size image that I cropped in the crop intent from the parcel it sends back  Here is some of the code I am usingp  precodepublic void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode,         Intent intent      if resultCode  Activity.RESULTCANCELED          Uri uri  null         switch requestCode          case FILESELECTCODE             if intent.getData  null                  uri  intent.getData                 cropSelectedPictureuri                          break         case PICTURESELECTCODE             uri  intent.getData             if uri  null                  Bundle bundle  intent.getExtras                 Bitmap photo  null                 if bundle  null                      photo  bundle.getParcelabledata                                  finishChangeProfilePicturephoto              else                  cropSelectedPictureuri                          break         case FILECROPCODE             Bundle extras  intent.getExtras             Bitmap thePic  extras.getParcelabledata             uri  extras.getParcelableuri             finishChangeProfilePicturethePic             break                   super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, intent   public void showCamera      Intent intent  new IntentMediaStore.ACTIONIMAGECAPTURE     intent.putExtracrop, true     intent.putExtraoutputX, pictureWidth     intent.putExtraoutputY, pictureHeight     intent.putExtraaspectX, pictureWidth     intent.putExtraaspectY, pictureHeight     intent.putExtrascale, true     intent.putExtrareturndata, true     try          cordova.startActivityForResult                 this, Intent.createChooserintent, Take Picture,                 PICTURESELECTCODE      catch android.content.ActivityNotFoundException ex           Potentially direct the user to the Market with a Dialog         Toast.makeTextcontext, Please install a Camera application.,                  Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show        public void cropSelectedPictureUri uri      Intent intent  new Intentcom.android.camera.action.CROP     intent.setDataAndTypeuri, image     intent.putExtracrop, true     intent.putExtraoutputX, pictureWidth     intent.putExtraoutputY, pictureHeight     intent.putExtraaspectX, pictureWidth     intent.putExtraaspectY, pictureHeight     intent.putExtrascale, true     intent.putExtrareturndata, true      PackageManager packageManager  context.getPackageManager     ListltResolveInfogt activities  packageManager.queryIntentActivitiesintent, 0     if activities.size gt 0          for int i  0 i lt activities.size i              String label  String activities.geti.loadLabelpackageManager             if label.equalsCrop picture                  ActivityInfo activity  activities.geti.activityInfo                 ComponentName name  new ComponentName activity.applicationInfo.packageName,                                                         activity.name                 intent.setComponentname                                 try          cordova.startActivityForResultthis, intent, FILECROPCODE      catch android.content.ActivityNotFoundException ex          Toast.makeTextcontext, Please install a Cropping program, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show       codepre

Negative 65127 pI have made a small app to attempt to learn to export plots to a file using shiny.  At the moment I am trying to use observer, and I have successfully exported plots, but not in the way I would like to.  For the most part I made this app copying the observer demo from the shiny gallery, and updating to try to do pdfs.  The UI just has two action buttons inputex, and inputplot, and a slider to change sample size.  It outputs a plot of two random normals against each other.  I tried to get the plots to output using the following code.p  precodepdf.checkltreactive     this should change when you hit the plot button, or when you change the sample size,     but not when you hit the export button. Whenever you hit the export button     pdf.checkinputex     inputn     inputplot     isolateinputex      obs lt observer     ifinputexgt0 amp inputexisolatepdf.check       when you hit the export button, this should start a pdf.  it shouldnt do it       for any other input, or when you open the app       pdffilelogfilename, width6, height  5          I included the inputplot to make this run whenever you hit the plot button, and     it should just be making these graphs.     inputplot     isolated inputn so this code doesnt run when you change n     isolateplotrnorminputn, rnorminputn, pch20, xlabX, ylab  Y, main inputplot     codepre  pWhat this actually does is export to a pdf every time I hit the plot button, but it wont export anymore after I move the n slider.  Also, if I have already moved the n slider, I have to hit the export button twice to start the pdf.  I do not know enough about the observer to know what I have done wrong.p  pOne other problem Im having is that I cant get the app to run codedev.offcode when it closes.  I can include something to manually run codedev.offcode, but if someone accidentally closes the app without doing that, Id like the pdf to still close.  I attempted to use the following.p  precode  sessiononSessionEndedfunction      dev.off     unlinklogfilename    codepre  pHonestly I am still pretty inexperienced with observer, and I am not entirely sure I understand how it functions.  Any help that can be given would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 65127 pOur QA dept tossed a weird one to me.  They test against IE 8 and they started seeing a clientside script error that I wasnt able to reproduce.  I tracked it down to something in AjaxControlToolkit, specifically our use of the UpdatePanelAnimationExtender.  More specifically to the setElementOpacity method.p  pWhen the error happens its in the minified code and unhelpfully all IE 8 shows is Unspecified error.  The member causing the error is c.filters.p  pThe funky thing is that I have a system with IE 8 and I dont see it.  I went through every Advanced Option tick and made sure all my settings were the same as the qa box.  We point at the same server.  Their IE 8 has the exception but mine doesnt and I havent yet figured out why.p  pThe objective seems pretty simple  when someone clicks Search, show a div with a spinner and fade out the old results update panel.  When the ajax call for the update panel is done, fade the update panel in and then hide the spinner.p  pOn the qa system exhibiting the error, the exception appears to be happening with the either the FadeOut or FadeIn conditions.  I figure this because the spinner displays and if I dismiss the error box the update panel completes with the results but the spinner doesnt go away.p  pBut Im puzzled why 2 identically configured IE 8s on different systems pointing at the same web server are producing different results, and of course the wtf does unspecified error mean and what does it mean with c.filtersp  pIve been googling for the past couple of hours and havent found enough threads to untangle it.

Negative 65127 pI am  new to java and still got a lot to learn. I have embedded C programming experience but totally new to object oriented programming.p  pI got the following that i need to understand.  When you create a class in Java it is the blueprint of an object you are going to create. And say i have a GUI with a button that creates a new bicycle after i have clicked the create new bicycle button you enter all the instance variables that it asks for in your GUI etc. p  pThen when you finish with say clicking on a complete button a object is created. With all the data you supplied in your GUI to fit the blueprint.p  pSo in your actionlistener when the complete button is pressed a piece of code like  Bicycle bike  new Bicycle should run. But bike is static and you never know how many entries of bicycles there is going to be. So how can the reference variable be made dynamic or act like its dynamicp  pSorry let me try and clear it up with the following.p  precodepublic void actionPerformedActionEvent e              Bicycle bike  new Bicycle      codepre  pthis is a action which is performed when Jbutton is pressed. This will create an object named bike. But what happens when button is pressed againWill it just override the previous object named bikep  pAnd you dont know how many objects of bicycle type the user will create by pressing the button. So i was wondering if something like a array can be used in the following wayp  precodeString bike[]  bike1,bike2,bike3 forint i0ilt3i     Bicycle bike[i]  new Bicycle  codepre  por use a array list because ultimately you wont know how many object will be createdp

Imagine a rectangular image with a transparent circle in the middle that you can see all the elements throughp  pCurrently, I can drag an element to the working area and it will only show within the circle and be cut off if it is outside the circle, but once I am done dragging it, I can not click and drag it again because it is under the image.p  pstrongHow do I get the rectangular image to display on top of all the elements, while still allowing the user to click and drag the elements they have already placedstrongp  pI made a diagram to make this easier to follow, but I dont have enough rep points to post itp  precodevar sb1sbMenu1  new sbMenu1 var sb2sbMenu2  new sbMenu2 var sb3sbMenu3  new sbMenu3 var sb4sbMenu4  new sbMenu4  backgrounds.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, flMouseClickHandler5  function flMouseClickHandler5eventMouseEventvoid        this.addChildsb1      sb1.visible  true     sb2.visible  false     sb3.visible  false     sb4.visible  false     sb1.x  0     sb1.y  550   nature.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, flMouseClickHandler4 function flMouseClickHandler4eventMouseEventvoid      this.addChildsb2      sb2.visible  true     sb1.visible  false     sb3.visible  false     sb4.visible  false     sb2.x  0     sb2.y  550   animals.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, flMouseClickHandler6 function flMouseClickHandler6eventMouseEventvoid      this.addChildsb3      sb3.visible  true     sb1.visible  false     sb2.visible  false     sb4.visible  false     sb3.x  0     sb3.y  550    objects.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, flMouseClickHandler7 function flMouseClickHandler7eventMouseEventvoid      this.addChildsb4      sb4.visible  true     sb1.visible  false     sb2.visible  false     sb3.visible  false     sb4.x  0     sb4.y  550      thesubmenu1.hill.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, createCopy var iint0 var tmpImageSprite to store which image is being dragged currently  function createCopyeMouseEventvoid      tmpImage  new Hillmc     tmpImage.name  hillChildi increment every copy     addChildtmpImage     tmpImage.x  mouseX     tmpImage.y  mouseY     tmpImage.startDrag     tmpImage.buttonMode  true     tmpImage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, onDown add the     mouse down to this new object    stage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP, onUp since the mouse is currently down, we need to listen for mouse up to tell the current copy to stop dragging    this will be called when click a copy function onDowneMouseEventvoid      tmpImage  Spritee.currentTarget get a reference to the one that was clicked, so we know which object to stop dragging on the global mouse up.     stage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP, onUp listen for the mouse up     tmpImage.startDrag  function onUpeMouseEventvoid      stage.removeEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP,onUp     if tmpImage.hitTestObjectthesubmenu1      removeChildtmpImage          else          tmpImage.stopDrag        thesubmenu1.foreground.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, createCopy2 function createCopy2eMouseEventvoid      tmpImage  new Foregroundmc     tmpImage.name  foregroundChildi increment every copy     addChildtmpImage     tmpImage.x  mouseX     tmpImage.y  mouseY     tmpImage.startDrag     tmpImage.buttonMode  true     tmpImage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, onDown add the mouse down to this new object     stage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP, onUp since the mouse is currently down, we need to listen for mouse up to tell the current copy to stop dragging   stage.addChildseal codepre

Negative 65127 pI have a Xamarin iOS app that is created with a storyboard. The storyboard is set to view as iPhone 5. I have a webview as below that fits the screen fine. When run on an iPhone 6 plus, it seems to grow fine and fills the entire iphone 6 plus screen. However when used on an iphone 4, a web page will fall off the bottom of the screen... which indicates to me that the webview is too big.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsleM3.png altenter image description herep  pI dont know why it seems to scale up but not down.

If I reconnect my phone to my laptop and run the program again, Ill post the logcat error log. p  pI have absolutely no idea whatsoever why I can run the program fine through the terminal but not through the launcher. That chunk is an essential step to the app, but I cant figure out how to make it run properly Op  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening p  pAny help would be appreciated p

Negative 65127 pIn my days before Laravel 5 I had a system which replaced a placeholder with a PHP script with the same name as the placeholder.

On every page can select multiple images in the gallery field for that page. These are not added to the text, the images field is separate from the content. This text fields contains an array json object with the images after saving.p  pIf he wants to use the images in the webpage he has to add a plugin to show the images by adding [gallery] in the text at the position he desires.p  pWhen the page is shown [gallery] is replaced with a PHP script gallery.plugin.php which takes the array of images and shows them nicely formatted and configured with a lightbox gallery script to view them in a bigger size.p  pUsers dont have to worry about the layout and functionality of the gallery and can put them anywhere in the content they like.p  pstrongThe way I did it the old waystrong Old, never updated code, worked flawlesslyp  precodepublic function decorateContentcontent      if parts  pregsplit[.], content, 0, PREGSPLITDELIMCAPTURE  PREGSPLITNOEMPTY              foreach parts as key gt value                      if strstrvalue, [ and strstrvalue, ]                              plugin  explode, strreplacearray[, ], , value                 if fileexiststemplatesplugins . strreplace, , trimplugin[0] . .plugin.php                                      cntnt . thisgtgetincludecontenttemplatesplugins . strreplace, , trimplugin[0] . .plugin.php, plugin                                            else                 cntnt . trimvalue                   else              cntnt  trimcntnt          return cntnt     function getincludecontentfilename, plugin      global db, Website, parameter      if isfilefilename              obstart         includefilename         contents  obgetcontents         obendclean         return contents          return false  codepre  pWith this I easily could add all functionality I wanted, [gallery], [formcontact]  translates to a slash for the path formcontact.php etc. Just create a script in the plugin directory with the same name as the plugin placeholder in the text.p  pBesides underscores for path translation some plugins can be fed with variables by using  in the plugin name, ex.

Negative 65127 pI am trying to build an application that runs under JavaSE and Android. Most of the code is the same between the two, but there are some specific functions that need to be separated. I use Eclipse. So I decided to put the shared code in a separate project, and then build one more project for Android and one for Java, which reference the shared project. I put all Java and Android specific functions in one class residing in the Java and Android specific projects. These classes are called UtilsJ for Java and UtilsA for Android. The code in the shared project uses a factory to determine at runtime which version it needs to pick, and then calls the class loader to load the right class. Essentially if property java.vm.name equals Dalvik, load UtilsA, else load UtilsJ and of course cast to the Utils interface before returning.  My question is simply if this is a good idea or is something going to eventually break Ive never used class loader before. Any other suggestions how to implement this sharing would also be appreciated.   p

Negative 65127 pAfter reading this question through, I realised that even I wasnt able to understand myself. So please allow me to try again.br Im trying to make a program in Java. The program has a multidimensional array of blocks like so p  precodeBlock[][] block  new Block[worldWidth][worldHeight] codepre  pA block is basically just an ID. p  precodepublic class Block   int id  public Blockint id      this.id  id  codepre  pThe program allows you to click somewhere on the screen and a block will be spawned there. Each block has a different image. To make it look smoother Id like to make blocks melt together when they are adjecent, you see this quite often in games. To do this I made 13 images that are 14 block, and I tried to make a program that would automatically pick the right image to make several blocks look like one big chunk. I got everything working, but I doubt the efficiency of my code. p  pHeres what I did p  pDivide each block into 4 subblocks.br Then for each subblock Id run the following code p  precodeint value if block[x][y].id gt 0   id 0 represents air, or no block.  if block[x][y].id  block[x1][y1].id value if block[x][y].id  block[x][y1].id value  10 if block[x][y].id  block[x1][y1].id value  100 if block[x][y].id  block[x1][y].id value  1000 if block[x][y].id  block[x1][y].id value  10000 if block[x][y].id  block[x1][y1].id value  100000 if block[x][y].id  block[x][y1].id value  1000000 if block[x][y].id  block[x1][y1].id value  10000000 if value  1011 g.drawImagelowerRightCorner because the subblocks on the left, on top and on the upperleft are the same id as this subblock.  etc.   codepre  pThis code works the way I want it to, but Im pretty sure there is an easier way, because this requires me to configure all 13 possibilities though still better than my previous 47. So my question is, is there an easier way to do this Hope my question is clearer this way. p

Negative 65127 pSo I have been looking around how to run python scripts on windows, but Im unable to run pygame scripts using windows xp 64 bits on a virtual machine. Ive tried simply running it with different versions of python, pyinstaller, py2exe and cxfreeze .p  pMy main problem is that im not sure what the problem really is. For example when I run the script like normal using python and nothing else  the script opens a cmd window but instantly closes it again, but when I try first transforming it to an .exe file I get an error saying the file is valid, but is for another machine type  pretty sure this has to do with 32 bit and 64bit python but im not sure how to fix it  and when I run it from the cmd I get an error saying theres no module named pygame.

Negative 65127 pThis is a problem Ive encountered several times, and always wondered why.p  pFor my code below as an example, if a string of whitespace is entered, the method will not print. However, after the next input with a value string containing characters, it will print all the whitespace strings and the valid character containing string. Why is this delayed and stored in memoryp  pExample for the code below Enter    returns nothing. Enter    returns nothing. Enter SwiggitySwooty returns    n    n SwiggitySwooty Explaination The whitespace containing strings are delayed until a valid character string is entered. p  pExtra info I use intellij, also happens when not sending the string to a method. Ive also had this happen during a whileinput.hasNext statement, in which I try to catch an invalid input as a string, when I want to take an integer. If I enter n amount of legitimate integers, and then a string, it would print out my please enter an integer that n amount of times like in this code.p  pLastly, if anyone thinks of a better title for this, let me know so I can change it for more exposure for those with similar questions.

Negative 65127 pI am working with a database used to store information about entities in the form of a tree of components. For example, it might have a camry object with children airconditioner and engine. The engine might have pistons as children, and aircon have vents as children.p  pThe idea is that the user would customcreate something like this as a template which would then be used to instantiate the camry tree as needed. So the user might first create the template, and then use it to add ten of those camry trees to a workshop, storing unique data against each by selecting add new car, selecting camry, and then picking a name.p  pHow would you store such a construction in a database, and is there any easy way to instantiate a tree like thatp

Negative 65127 pMy implementation will consist of a java class representing a source repository. I want my implementation to be such that there will be only one object per source repository.

Negative 65127 pIm writing a simple puzzle game in javascript.  a hrefhttpjeremyseanbell.comgames relnofollowYou can play it herea and the a hrefhttpjeremyseanbell.comgames12tone.js relnofollowsource code is herea.  It uses musical notes as its game pieces, and you can press a Play button to make it play the notes.  The notes also light up when they are being played.  The problem is that there seems to be a lag between the sound and the changing graphics.p  pFor the audio playback method,codethis.playToneRowcode, I used a global variable to iterate through all the notes, and then in the method that shows the pieces, codethis.drawNotescode, I just grabbed the value of that global variable to determine which game piece should light up.  But Im guessing this isnt the best way to do it, because there seems to be a delay between the .play call and the actual sound.p  pSo I was thinking that a better way to control the changing graphics would be some kind of method that tells which audio object is currently playing if any and then I can just change the corresponding image.p  precodethis.playToneRow  function      var x  0,         length  this.notes.length  2,         myArray  this.notes     j  0     currentSound  this.player      function runIteration           x  myArray[j]          setTimeoutfunction                      if typeof x  number                              noteSound[x].play                      , 500          if j  length                      j  1             currentSound  0             return                   j          setTimeoutrunIteration, 500           runIteration    this.drawNotes  function      this.noteText       for var i  0 i lt 12 i              this.noteText  noteNames[this.notes[i]]         this.noteText  ,          if j  3   i ampamp currentSound  this.player                      ctx.drawImagethis.gamePieceHi, i  52  85, 275  this.notes[i]  17.7                  else                      ctx.drawImagethis.gamePiece, i  52  95, 285  this.notes[i]  17.7                codepre

Negative 65127 pIm attempting to query a MySQL database on a webpage. Within my R script, I have 4 different query functions along with multiple calculations which will display statistical graphs to my webpage, all dependent on an N variable. Im using PHP using shellexec to call to R and send N. Im using the RMySQL amp ggplot2 libraries in R.p  hr  pRunning my R script with just 1 basic query function includes dbConnect, dbGetQuery and on.exitdbDisconnect, then using png, plot, and dev.off takes 15 seconds to display the graph on my website.p  pWith 2 functions and 2 plots, I havent even had the patience to wait it out to see if it works since the load time is so long. The queries themselves are rather lengthy could probably made easier through looping, but Ive tested them to work through MySQL and Im not sure how to avoid loop errors with SQL.p  hr  ul lipCould the long loading time be due to having dbConnectdbDisconnect in each individual function Should I only do this once in the script i.e. create a new connect function and then call to the other functions from herepli lipIs it the fact Im running multiple and lengthy query requests If thats the case, would it be better if I split each query function into individual R scripts, then shellexec each and allow the user to select which graphs to display i.e. check boxes in HTMLPHP that allow for the execution of each scriptgraph desiredpli ul  hr  pThrough testing, I know that my logic is there, but I might be totally missing something. I would like to speed up the process so the website user doesnt have to stare at a loading screen forever and I can actually get some tangible results.p  pSorry for the lengthy request, I appreciate any help you can give If youd like to see the webpage or any of my code to get a better idea, I can upload that and share.p  pThanksp  pEDIT It should also be noted that Im using a while loop x lt 100 for some of the calculations I know loops in R are typically known to be expensive processes but the whole vectoring thing I think thats the name is over my head.p

Negative 65127 pIve just started using PHP prepared statements and thought I was starting to understand them. However, Im having major problems with the following code which suggests my understanding is not as thorough as I thought it was. Ive tried lots of variations but Im still getting a fatal error.p  pBasically, Ive used prepared statements to insert data into a database. That bit works fine. I then want to retrieve the latest inserted record to display to the user so they can check that everything is OK. It is likely that the database will be updated on a fairly regular basis and new columns may be added to the tables as required. Consequently, I dont want to bindresult to a prescribed list of variables but, instead, I want to retrieve an associative array that I can step through with a loop.

Negative 65127 pUnit test frameworks generally provide very nice assertion failure messages Im using gtest describing expected and actual values to a particular test. Furthermore, you know the origin of the function call because youre testing the interface of the class.p  pIn contrast, codeassertcode, when used as a sanity check in the implementation provides some, but more cryptic information. For example, the one Im working on now . . p  precodeAssertion failed latency gt stdchronomilliseconds0, function setLatency, file pathtomy.cpp line 71 codepre  pSo I know which assertion failed, but I have no idea what the values were that caused it to fail, and more importantly, I dont know the problematic function from which codesetLatencycode was called.p  pA simple solution normally would be drop to the debugger, but I cannot do this in this instance.

Negative 65127 pI have an image processing app which needs to remember which photos were already processed. The solution I came up with was to store a given String abc, into the EXIF MAKE tag. So, in order to filter the photos, my app needs to read the EXIF MAKE attribute to see if it contains my String abc. I have tested it with the following code and its execution took around 15 seconds on a friends phone with Android 5.1.1 CyanogenMod and 1000 photos, which is a very poor time.p  precodepublic boolean isAlreadyProcessedFile imageFile      android.media.ExifInterface exifInterface  new ExifInterfaceimageFile.getAbsolutePath     String attribute  exifInterface.getAttributeExifInterface.TAGMAKE      return attribute.containsabc  codepre  pOther solution I thought about was to store the processed images filenames into a SQLite database. This would be a faster option, but it has the problem that if a user copys his photos to a new device, my app wouldnt remember which photos were already processed, so I would need to backup my database to the cloud and restore it on the new device.p  pSo, is there a more efficient way to read EXIF image metadata If not, is there a better way to accomplish this than the second way I mentioned to store the images names in a databasep  pThank youp

Negative 65127 pI am using spring webflow 2.4.1, JSF 2.2.9 und tomcat 7.0.47 as an embedded servlet runtime with a complete java configuration no web.xml. Java is in Version 1.7.011. I developed a simple smart web application, which has one input field, which takes a name and displays this field value on a second page as a demo or SSCCE. Im using java bean validation to validate the input entered on the first site. Everytime the value is valid, it is correctly transfered to the second page. But if I enter an invalid value, the application shows the first page again containing an error message, but the input field is empty. And I do not really know, why Could it be a problem with the JSF lifecycle As far as I understood, the lifecycle has the following steps 1. Create  restore view 2. Apply request values 3. validate values 4. update modell 5. invoke application 6. render viewp  pThe step 3 validates the user input. And 4 and 5 are only executed, if the validation returns without an error. So on validation error, my modell is empty because no update modell has been executed. And therefore, the reshown view is also empty. Everything correct so far How is it possible to refill the inputcomponents on page 1, if an validation error occurs Im a little bit confused about that, because I thought, that it has a default behaviour to redisplay the values, if the user enters incorrect data at least for those fields containing correct values...p  pHere is my code TestBeanp  precodepublic class TestBean implements

Negative 65127 pI am working on a producerconsumer problem with a modification. Yet, there is a race condition and I am debating the best way to go about it. There might be cleaner ways and I wonder if anyone has done something similar and if possible share a better solution.p  pit starts as normal producerconsumer using a queue. One producer thread reads items from the disk and enqueues on a shared queue. Then multiple consumer threads tries to dequeues the items for processing. However each item has a tag like a thread Id that MUST match the consumer tag. A consumer thread looks at the front of the queue and checks the tag of the item. If it does not match the tag of the consumer thread, the consumer must go to sleep and wait until the front of the queue has an item that matches its tag. A bit confusing, but the pseudocode below hopefully clarifies the algorithmp  precodestruct item      This is unique tag that only a specific consumer can consumer     int    consumerTag       data for the consumer to consume     void   pData     PRODUCER THREAD gt only 1   producer reads items  each item has a tag to a specific consumer while item  read      lockqueue     if queueNotFull              enqueueitem          else              check front of the queue, notify worker.

Negative 65127 pI recently upgraded my laptop and installed the latest Eclipse Mars.  Have previously used Juno and then Lunar, but I am struggling with this one changed behaviour, and cannot find any hints anywhere if it is possible to change.p  pWord Completion is bound to Alt. In previous versions, matches where proposed on what you had typed before the first time you pressed the combination, now it proposes on the current selection.p  pExamplep  pIf my file containsp  ul lifooli lifootli liforthli lifootholdli lifontli ul  pand I type emfoem, previous versions would cycle through all 5 proposals.  Mars, on the other hand first proposes emfooem, then emfootem, then emfootholdem, and then no others.  It pretty much accepts and applies the first match when I press it.p  pThis is I believe a language and context insensitive key combination, but in case people are wondering, I have Pydev, Javascript, and XML language extensions installed. p  pI love this context insensitive completion when I know I have 4 or 5 variables that all start the same, and I want to complete it after typing a handful of characters.  I find the new behaviour almost unusable, if the first match is not the one I want, I have to clear back to the first non matching character, type the next character and try again... p  pAny pointers greatly appreciated.p

Negative 65127 pWhen i try to link dynamically against glew, the linker will throw errors like codeundefined reference impglewGenVertexArrayscode. The basic meaning is clear  the linker cant find any address to link the function calls against.p  pWhat bothers me is that i used the normal glew.h header and linked against glew32 not glew32s  ill come to that later on. Not defining codedefine GLEWSTATICcode, Glew should link dynamically out of the box. But the undefined error indicates that somehow it is trying to link statically against them. So i fixed it by linking against codeglew32scode and added codedefine GLEWSTATICcode before codeinclude GLglew.hcodep  pBut this is in my opinion just a workarround  i want to know why glew assumes static linking, when not asked to. Especially why it even doesnt work when you just link against glew32s by not defining codeGLEWSTATICcodep  pstrongUpdatestrong Im using gcc 5.1.0 mingw64p  pFull error when linking against codeglew32code having codeGLEWSTATICcode NOT definedp  precodesrcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.o In function CoreWindowSDLenterMain DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp61 undefined reference to impGLEWVERSION45 DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp68 undefined reference to impglewGenVertexArrays DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp69 undefined reference to impglewBindVertexArray DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp74 undefined reference to impglewGenBuffers DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp76 undefined reference to impglewBindBuffer DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp77 undefined reference to impglewBufferData DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp109 undefined reference to impglewEnableVertexAttribArray DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp110 undefined reference to impglewBindBuffer DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp111 undefined reference to impglewVertexAttribPointer DworkspaceEngineDebug..srcSDLWrapperCoreWindowSDL.cpp114 undefined reference to impglewDisableVertexAttribArray collect2.exe error ld returned 1 exit status codepre  pThe question is, these functions should be loaded at runtime, why is gccglew trying to link against themp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 65127 pSorry for asking a really basic question, but its probably the first time for a number of years I feel really confused.p  pWindows provides two set of controls Windows.UI.Xaml namespace I thinks this is referred  as Metro, used for Windows Store Apps, and System.Windows WPF for Desktop.p  pSince I am going to develop Windows Store Apps mainly for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 phones, I will have to stick to Windows.UI.Xaml, and this has not only a separate set of UI elements, but also separate set of bitmaps, brushes, etc. Windows.UI.Xaml.Media vs System.Windows.Media.p  pI found that Windows.UI.Xaml provides a very limited support for graphics, much less than provided by WPF, Android or even iOS platform. To start with, I got stuck with a simple task tiling a backgroundp  pSince Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.ImageBrush do not support tiling, I wanted to to do that manually. Some sites suggest making numerous number of children, each holding a tile. Honestly, it looks as a rather awkward approach to me, so I decided to do it in what appears a more natural way create an offscreen tiled image, assign it to a brush and assign the brush as the background for a panel.p  pThe tiling code is rather straightforward it probably has mistakes, possibly wont even not run on a phone, because of some unavailable classes used. p  precodeint panelWidth  int contentPanel.Width int panelHeight  int contentPanel.Height  Bitmap bmpOffscreen  new BitmappanelWidth, panelHeight  Graphics gOffscreen  Graphics.FromImagebmpOffscreen  string bmpPath  Path.CombineWindows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.Path, Assetsjustatile.png  System.Drawing.Image tile  System.Drawing.Image.FromFilebmpPath,  true  int tileWidth  tile.Width  int tileHeight  tile.Height   for int y  0 y lt panelHeight y  tileHeight      for int x  0 x lt panelWidth x  tileWidth          gOffscreen.DrawImagetile, x, y codepre  pNow I presumably have the tiled image in bmpOffscreen. But how assign it to a brush To do that I need to convert Bitmap to BitmapSource, while I couldnt find something similar to System.Windows.Imaging.CreateBitmapSourceFromHBitmap available for WPF structurep
