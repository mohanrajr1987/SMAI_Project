Positive 1258 pI have added the cwaccam2 library to my project and I uploaded it in the play store. All seems to be good, but when I look my app in the play store from a nexus 7, the app says that isnt compatible with my device.

Positive 1258 pIm having difficulty with the Samsung S4 mini.  Like many others developing camera apps the S4 mini seems to be a problematic device.p  pThe device has the following preview modes availablep  p960x720, 1280x720, 1392x1392, 960x540, 320x240, 640x480, 720x720, 720x480, 144x176, 176x144p  pThe screen resolution of the device is 540x960.p  pIm using the common determineBestPreview function that most people developing camera apps are using which chooses 540x960 as the best preview mode.  Im using the camera in portrait mode and rotating the preview through 90 degrees.p  pThe trouble is that the preview is stretched people look very thin and stretched vertically.  I have tried many things, including allowing the user to change the preview mode.  Every single preview mode seems to have the same effect.  I have also changed the surface view to stretch beyond the bounds of the display which in this case is futile since its the same.p  pEvery phone Ive tested on Xperia S, Xperia z3 compact, one plus one, nexus 5, galaxy s6, nexus 7 has worked except this one device.  Im at the point now where Ive spent so much time that Im thinking of excluding it from my supported devices.  What makes it more difficult is that I dont own the device which makes it harder to debug.p  pHas anyone else solved this problemp
Positive 1258 pIve got 1st person view camera, rotated by mouse movement. But when i rotate it in response to mouse motion, the camera rotates instantly, jumping from one position to another. I want it to be smooth nicely looking motion. I tried some things, some of them seem to be working a little, but thats still not smooth and not flexible. I wonder if there are some good intuitive techniques for smooth camera rotation, which would also allow me to apply some effects. I think there might be some, since its the very basics of game development.  p  pI cant just interpolate between 2 static points, i need camera to respond to dynamic mouse motion.  p
Positive 1258 pI was recently using the a hrefhttpdocs.unity3d.comScriptReferenceWebCamTexture.html relnofollowWebCamTexture API in Unitya, but ran across a couple issues.p  pMy biggest issue is orientation.

Rotating the phone didnt help.p  pThen I changed the default orientation of the app to landscape and it worked, but the image was reflected letters and such would be backwards in the image.

Positive 1258 pI am working on a camera Andoid app using QML based on Qt 5.5. I need a live filter on the cameras preview and I would like to use the best preview resolution available. In native java I could get all the supported preview resolutions using the methodp  pandroid.hardware.CameragetParameters.getSupportedPreviewSizesp  pAnd then choose the best one based on the screen resolution.  QML on the other hand, will automatically set the preview resolution which usually has aspect ratio 43 and this does not cover the hole screen like on the qml declerativecamera example. So is possible to change the preview resolution on a QML displayp  pPlease note that I do not want to just zoom on the default preview to cover the whole screen. p  pThanksp

Positive 1258 pI recently made an Android camera application meant for Sony Xperia phones. The API documentation mentions writing xperiacameraaddons in the description of the Play Store, which I did. The camera app has been downloaded three times now, so far so good. However, I would like to have a larger audience know about my app, which I thought was done by simply submitting the app to the Play Store and writing that specific comment in the description of the app. My understanding was that this is all thats required for my app to show up in the downloadable section of Xperia phones camera, where a few other developers apps do show up. I contacted Sony Developer World and I was told to pose this as a question on Stack Overflow, so here you go. If not in the camera app, I was hoping to find the app at least somewhere in Sonys Whats New app, but nowhere can my app be found unless specifically searching for the name in the Play Store.p  pIf anyone could help me out with this, I will be very thankfulp  pemBeing new on Stack Overflow Im not sure if I should be posting links, so in case its relevant to know my app is called Monochrome and should be easily found in the Play Store it has an icon closely resembling Sonys own camera icons.emp

Positive 1258 pI want to connect an external camera to an iPhone the camera built into the iPhone is inadequate for my needs and then write an iPhone app that allows me to send a signal to the external camera when I desire to take a picture and then immediately download the taken photo onto my iPhone so that I can send it wirelessly to a server somewhere else.p  pI have a lot of experience with web programming and JS, but I have no experience with iPhone apps, and Im not sure if what I want to do is even possible. Ideally, if I could get away with coding this in JS and then using Cordova or something similar to make an app that can run on any iDevice or Android device, that would be great.p  pHowever, assuming that that is not possible, I would like to focus on an app for just iDevices at first. I looked around the web for resources on this subject, but I couldnt find anything.p  pI have two questionsp  ol liIs what I want to do even possibleli liIf so, can I do it by using web technologies and then something like Cordova andor a Chrome App to convert it to something that can be used on any smart device If not, what are some good booksresources for learning how to do this on an iPhoneli ol  pEven though Ive never coded an iPhone app before, Im more than happy to try to learn, but I need some booksresources that explain everything from the basics of how to create a Hello, World iPhone app to the point that I can do all the things listed above.p  pThank you very much.p

Positive 1258 pIm currently trying to implement an alternate method to webcambased AR using an external tracking system. I have everything in my environment configured save for the extrinsic calibration. I decided to use codecvsolvePnPcode as it supposedly does pretty much exactly I want, but after two weeks I am pulling my hair out trying to get it to work. A diagram below shows my configuration. c1 is my camera, c2 is the optical tracker Im using, M is the tracked marker attached to the camera, and ch is the checkerboard.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com3FCYF.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3FCYF.png altDiagram of my configurationap  pAs it stands I pass in my image pixel coordinates acquired with codecvfindChessboardCornerscode. The world points are acquired with reference to the tracked marker M affixed to the camera c1 The extrinsic is thus the transform from this markers frame to the camera origin.  I have tested this with data sets up to 50 points to mitigate the possibility of local minima, but for now Im testing with only four 2D3D point pairs. The resulting extrinsic I get from the rvec and tvec returned from codecvsolvePnPcode is massively off in terms of both translation and rotation relative to both a ground truth extrinsic I manually created as well as a basic visual analysis The translation implies a 1100mm distance while the camera is at most 10mm away. p  pInitially I thought the issue was that I had some ambiguities in how my board pose was determined, but now Im fairly certain thats not the case. The math seems pretty straightforward and after all my work on setting the system up, getting caught up on what is essentially a oneliner is a huge frustration. Im honestly running out of options, so if anyone can help I would be hugely in your debt. My test code is posted below and is the same as my implementation minus some rendering calls.

If this works as expected, the first coordinate I mark will be approximately lt0,0. The resulting transform from solvePnP will then be multiplied by the inverse of the worldtocameramarker transformation, thus resulting in hopefully the extrinsic matrix.p  pEDIT 3 I performed the steps described in step 2. After establishing a coordinate system on the checkerboard, I calculated the transform cTw from the checkerboard space to the world space and verified it in my rendering environment. I then calculated the extrinsic mTc representing the transform from the camera space to the checkerboard space. The camera marker transform wTr was acquired from the tracking system. Finally, I took all of the transforms and multiplied them as follows to move my transformation all the way from camera origin to camera markerp  pcodemTccTwwTrcodep  pLo and behold it gave the the emexact same result.em Im dying here for any sign of what Im doing wrong. If anyone has any clue, I beg of you to help.p  pEDIT 4 Today I realized that I had configured my checkerboard axes in such a way that they were in a lefthanded coordinate system. Since OpenCV operates using standard righthand form, I decided to retry the tests with my checkerboard frame axes configured in a righthand fashion. While the results were about the same, I did notice that the worldtocheckerboard transform was now a nonstandard transform format, i.e. the 3x3 rotation matrix was no longer roughly symmetrical around the diagonal as it should be. This indicates that my tracking system is not using a righthand coordinate system Would have been great if they had documented that. Or anything, for that matter. While Im not sure how to resolve this, I am certain that it is part of the issue. Ill keep hammering at it and hope someone here knows what to do. Ive also added a diagram provided to me on the OpenCV boards by a hrefhttpwww.answers.opencv.orgusers16447eduardo relnofollow titleEduardoEduardoa. Thanks Eduardop

When stray far away from 0, 0, 0 there are some floatingpoint precision issues, and that its normal.p  pstrongThe Complete Explanation Of The Problemstrongp  pIf i create 2 cubes or more in the scene and i place one in another as a child with a distance between them and i go far away in the scene, the 2 cube will  and they are not able to keep the child are not able to keep the good distance.p  pFor exemple a rigged model will be the best example for show a view of the importance of that problem.p  pemHeres an like from an youtube videoem youtube.comwatchvfqeEKE0p90Ep  pstrongUnderstanding The Problemstrongp  pWhy the child object arent able to keep the correct distance to the parent.p  pIn unity3d the vector take float parameters. The float have a precision to only 7 digits.p  pThe mathematic formule to calculate that distance called magnitude itsp  precodepoint Ax, y, z  A20, 20, 20 point Bx, y, z  B10, 10, 10  magnitude  AxBx2  AyBy2  AzBz2 magnitude  20102  20102  20102 magnitude  102  102  102 magnitude  100  100  100 magnitude  300 magnitude  17.32050807568877... codepre  pSo the float have only 7 digits of precision, that mean all of the decimals situated after the 7th digit will be erased. That mean, the child object doesnt keeped the exact position.p  pstrongSolving the problemstrongp  pI am 100 shore than there are a lot of ways to fix that, but personally i dont have any idea how to do it.p  pRust have a ViewModel system.

Positive 1258 pThere are quite a few users of the Sony A7 line of cameras for astrophotography. It has been a source of frustration for many all of us that Sony has not published any means of automating these cameras directly via USB. Capture One for Sony Pro starts in this direction. However, it is sorely lacking in the intervalometer area. For example, there is no clear way to trigger 25 exposures of 300 seconds backtoback. It also only has limited control of the camera.p  pThe Sony RCC app also leaves a lot to be desired. While there is a confusing way to schedule multiple image captures via a rudimentary intervalometer, there is no way to establish the length of the exposure outside of what the camera can natively perform on its own. In my case, my A7S will only take up to a 30 second exposure on its own.p  pWhat is needed from Sony seems to be clear documentation as to how the use the USB command set for software in general. For Astrophotography, software such as Sequence Generator Pro, The Sky X Pro, Maxim DL, and many, many others emrequireem this interface to the camera to work. In the forums for many of these software developers, it is easy to find people asking for support of the A7, only to be turned away because Sony doesnt appear to be interested in helping out with the necessary SDK. p  pCanon and Nikon cameras do all of this very well See BackyardEOS as an example. Search BackyardEOS on google.p  pAny developer would be able to solve this by developing an ASCOM driver that presents the camera to most astronomical software for control. Again, no USB SDK means this is not possible.p  pNo Sony camera to my knowleged, including the flagship A7 series, is capable of any of this SIMPLY because Sony has continued to withhold the SDK.p  pFrustrating fact  it emisem possible to hold bulb mode on the A7 line by pressing the software capture button in the RCC software and holding it by mouseclick. One software developer ingeniously worked around the limitations of the Sony cameras by finding a way to artificially hold that button down, thereby allowing longer exposures. Still, this is just a hack.p  pAs evidence of the desire for these capabilities, I submit the following as a very small slice of the conversations behing held. I do not believe that Sony is listening it its customers.p  pa hrefhttpwww.cloudynights.comtopic503749sonya7sviableforeaa relnofollowhttpwww.cloudynights.comtopic503749sonya7sviableforeaaap  pa hrefhttpwww.cloudynights.comtopic488461issonyreallyalpha relnofollowhttpwww.cloudynights.comtopic488461issonyreallyalphaap  pThere are many more conversations like these  just check google. The base of all is such the A7S and its ilk are wonderful astrophotography cameras, but Sonys unwillingness to provide support for USB tethering is essentially killing the idea. The wifi SDK is sorely limited, and forces the user to disconnect from their primary wifi network to operate. It also does not support bulb exposures of varying lengths.p  pWhat we need is, at a minimump  ul liFull featured USB tethering capability, including Live Viewli liWebcamlike capabilities  the camera should be able to be seen as a webcam by a PCMac, etcli liFull control of the camera, all exposure settings li liFull ability to execute intervalometer functions, with exposure length controlled at the PCli liOnthefly image download to PCli liVideo capture should also be able to be viewed this way, even if at a lower resolutionli liFull lens control  focus, aperture, focal length given the lens support for itli ul  pOthers, please add below as you see fit.p  pSony  were telling you what we want.

Negative 1258 pThe docs for pipelined functions say that DML is not allowed when they are used in a SQL statement typically a codeSELECTcode, and in most examples the pipelined functions are used for data generation or transformation accepting a custor as parameter, but not issuing any DML statements.p  pNow, technically, it is possible to use SELECTs without any error from Oracle a hrefhttpwww.dbaoracle.comt5Fora5F145515Fcannot5Fperform5Fa5Fdml5Foperation5Finside5Fa5Fquery.htm relnofollowORA 14551a will not occur. However, I have experiences reproducible strange behavior of the select even though codePRAGMA AUTONOMOUSTRANSACTIONcode is emnotem being used, the rows retrieved by the codeSELECTcode seem emnotem always taking the current local transaction into account, which feels like a bug to me. Even more disturbing is the fact that, when using a distributed transaction for instance via ORAMTS instead of a local transaction, the transaction is used.p  pstrongEditstrong As it turns out, the strange effect seems related to some WITH statements in the query, which sometimes work and sometimes not depending on the current mood of the Oracle optimizer, at least in 10g. In some cases, I get a ORA32036, then again it doesnt occur, without changing the code at all. Now it looks as if the queries which sometimes fail with the ORA32036 are the ones which also fail to use the correct transaction, and it may be unrelated to the pipelined function.p  pSo my specific questions arep  ul lipIs there any, preferably official, statement whether codeSELECTcodes in pipelined table functions are allowed and what their transactional context ispli lipIs there another way of modularizing commonly used queries which can be used in SQL statements just as table functions can with codeTABLEcodepli lipHas anyone also experienced such behavior and does maybe know more about it Ive looked into metalink, but unfortunately I didnt find anything specific on the topic.pli ul

And thats it. The optimization takes place when we somewhere else asks to findT, x, now when we search the tree we will come to a leaf node, since x isnt inserted the tree yet it only exists in the hash map M, we hash x and compare it to the keys in M to see if it is supposed to be in the tree. If its found in M then we add it to the tree and remove it from M.p  pThis would eliminate the findT, x operation on addT, x and reduce it to addM, x which is O1. And then emabemuse the findT, x operation that is performed when we look up the node the first time to insert it.p

Negative 1258 pDoes anyone have experience with KODO JDOs distributed cache mechanism I would like to knowp  p1 what is the latency like between distributed cache updates so if two users are hitting two separate caches i.e. on two different JVMs and are using the same data and one makes an update, when will the other user, using the other cache, see the updatep  p2 how much data will be transferred between JVMs if an update is made to one cache, does it simply tell the other caches to drop the objects by telling it the primary keys of the objects to flush concern is the network trafficoverhead of managing the distributed cachep  p3 when you have external feeds updating your database throughout the day i.e. not coming in through your application, how easy is it to externally invoke a cache flushp  pOur application runs in a Weblogic cluster of 12 JVMS and we are considering enabling the distributed cache to help with performance coming from large object graphs being pulled from our database  which are currently not cached but would like to know some realworld experience with 1,2,and 3.

Negative 1258 pI am trying to transform a set of two radio buttons in a stack of two labels, one blue and on gray representing, respectively, the selected radio and the unselected one. Clicking on this stack will change which of the labels is blue and which of the radio buttons is checked. It works well but it breaks down in an ugly manner when the two labels arent of the same width.

                in which order they appear. If looks better when the longer word is above the other though.

This is what the javascript used to do when you click on the stack if the label is of class stackTop, it changes it to stackBottom, and viceversa. Now, only the colour is changed..             ltpgt         ltformgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo the question is How would I go about resolving the known issues explained in the test page Im sorry, I know this is no way of asking a question, but I just dont know how else to phrase it.

I want to be able to sync across devices, so people can work on one machine, save, then get on another machine and load their stuff.p  pThe questions arep  p1  Is it a bad idea to store json on the server  Why parse the json on the server into model objects when it is just going to be passed back to the other clients as jsonp  p2 Im not sure if I would want to try a NoSql technology for this.  I am not breaking the json down, for now the only relationships in the db would be from a user account to their entries. Other than the user data, the domain model would be a String, which is the json.  Advice welcome.p  pIn theory, in the future I might want to do some processing on the server or set up more complicated relationships.  In other words, right now I would just be saving the json, but in the future I might want a more traditional relational system.  Would NoSQL approach get in the way of thisp  p3  Are there any security concerns with this  JS injection for example  In theory, for this use case, the user doesnt get to enter anything, at least right now.  p  pThank you in advance.p  pEDIT  Thanx for the answers.  I chose the answer I did because it went into the most detail on the advantages and disadvantages of NoSql.p

Negative 1258 pJust so everyone knows, Im relatively new to JavaScript, and Ive been trying to do things in pure JS rather than using jQuery, etc.. At a place I contract for, we have an Exchange server, I use the webmail client. p  pTo prevent it from timing me out when there isnt any activity, I started putting together a Safari Extension since I could inject JS into a page using one. And I thought it would be a good exercise since Im learning JS from scratch.p  pWell, that part of it works, except for when youre replying, or sending a new email, so I tried adding in the second bit of code to prevent that, but it still refreshes.

Negative 1258 pIm implementing a custom datasource in my CakePHP application, Ive implemented the basic functions for a datasource codereadcode, codelistSourcescode, codedescribecode. The datasource uses Xml as input and I would really like to use findneighbors on the Xml and was wondering if Cake automagically implements this feature because the codereadcode function is there, or if I need to extend the datasource somehow.

By coupling this datasource to a   model, you are then able to use   Modelfindsave as you would   normally, and the appropriate data   andor parameters used to call those   methods will be passed on to the   datasource itself, where you can   decide to implement whichever features   you need e.g. Modelfind options   such as conditions parsing, limit   or even your own custom parameters.p blockquote

Obviously, there is a chance of concurrent operations on the entire object, but there will never be concurrencies on a particular element of codevecOfVeccode. p  pCould someone explain as to whether the above would be considered threadsafe Would the same extent to STL maps also If not, please explain.

Tab 3 however has some viewControllers in its navigationController that support landscape orientation.p  pWhen I am in tab 3 now and move to one of the viewControllers that support landscape I am able to turn the device and the interface changes to landscape.

Negative 1258 pWhat I am trying to do here is controlling how a group of fields are showing up on node view. I dont want to control them by user role, as this is going to be a node level permission and I dont want these permissions affect other nodes with the same content type.p  pFor example imagine I have three different roles ROLEA, ROLEB and ROLEC.  Each role has its own permissions set for accessing to fields. When a node is created for the first time, a user with role of ROLEA, can see couple of fields and can edit the value of those fields. When node is published, a ruleaction get called through Rules module, and will set a status field in that node to STAGE1. After this event a new node created, if user ROLEA goes to that node that was just created by herself, those fields that were editable before, should be readonly now. This means when Rules  module, set the value of the status field to STAGE1, when that node wants to get loaded by Drupal, we need to check the status value, and based on that if it was for example STAGE1, modify some other field in that particular node, read only or editable, or in some cases hide them from user. So my guess is to create a module that every time a node of that type, is loading, check the status field which is a field that we have created in that node type and based on the value of that field, decide which node should show up or hide. This should override the permission that have been set for those fields on that particular node type.p  pWhat I am trying to do is creating a method to control which field is going to be read only editable  hidden based on the value of a specific field in that content type, which has been set by Roules module, based on different stages of working on that node by different group of users. I am not using Organic Group. I use Drupal 7 and Rules module and couple of other permission related modules. But I found that there is no such a way to handle field visibility in node level,  separate from user roles.p  pDo you think there is any other way to achieve the same result I appreciate if you could give me an idea about how to create such a module.p  pI really appreciate any and all input.p

Negative 1258 pIm using sIFR3 to render some text on a website. That site has print feature that will replace the page frame and leave only the text. An appropriate sIFRalternate style for printing is set as well.p  pThe problem Im running into is that sIFR puts a CSS minheight as an inline style on the H2 that is replaced. And due to this setting, that seems to be calculated from the fontsize given for that element, IE7 cuts off letters like gpq  letters that go below the baseline of the text.p  pI have tried and googled for a solution but couldnt find anything relating to this issue. Or how I could stop sIFR from setting the minheight value altogether.p  pYou can test with any sIFR Text that falls back to Arial, for example, with a given height on the element it is located in even nonpixel values.p  pThanks and cheersp

Negative 1258 pCurrently when a new user completes the signup process i send them to the homepage with a param welcome equal to 1, which tells the homepage to put a couple of bits on the page. Im also tracking this extra param in google analytics to keep track of signups.p  pHowever, theres a problem with this in that if someone reloads the home page, or goes back to it from another page, then this event is triggered again.  Ive had a request to put a virtual page view on the submit button for the signup form like on this page a hrefhttpwww.google.comsupportforumpGoogle20Analyticsthreadtid4e2bca583dc023f1amphlen relnofollowhttpwww.google.comsupportforumpGoogle20Analyticsthreadtid4e2bca583dc023f1amphlena but the problem with this is that it will fire when the user submits the form and it fails validation, which isnt a signup, obviously.p  pIm looking for a better approach, basically.p  pOne thing that i have seen suggested is to render out a js snippet calling a virtual page view on the subsequent page, if the signup is successful, dependent on some instance variable for example.  This would deal with the refresh situation, as the variable required to shove in the extra js would not be set if the user just refreshes the home page.  However, it would be triggered i think if the user clicks back to get to that page. The problem with emthisem though is that i do a redirect rather than render a template to the home page, so the instance variable wouldnt persist anyway.p  pGrateful for any advice  maxp

Negative 1258 pEdit To be clearer, I basically need to differentiate between the different clients doing remote method invocation in objects stored in the server remote object registry. How could I do thatp  pAnd here is the situation p  pI am currently in the process of creating a clientserver command line interface application using Java rmi to exchange data stored in Strings between the clients and server. p  pIm having problem whereas I must allow a client to send an authentication command with a userpass. This authentication command exemple user myUserName myPassword must be sent through the same remotely called method used to send all the other commands for which the server must answer. p  pMy problem  The client must, strictly, only send his commands and display the text result of his command received from the server. As simple a client as it gets, it has no state.  p  pSince some methods requires the client to be logged in or have a different serverside implementation if the client is logged in or not, I need to to keep track of the client logged in state on the servernot a problem, I plan to simply keep a time stamp on each user in the user database and use a timeout and must also differentiate between different clients.   p  pNow, I think I have a good idea of how remote object works and Ive been able to register a remote object on the server side and access a remote method from it using the client. p  pSo, I need to do more, I must not only have client being able to access remote method, I also need the remote methodand the server running them to know which network client is invoking this methodwithout passing the client usernamepass as parameters in the remote method. p  pI think the rmiclientsocketfactory and rmiserversocketfactory must be customly used to do this, but I dont know how to proceed. p  pthanks you all for your time. p
Negative 1258 pI have an Array populated with potentially lots of records. Every records shall be saved by the server in a RESTful RecordsController.

The matching controller is a standard Rails controller.p  pMy Problem now is, that in production mode this seems very slow. Its about 4 requestss where there the server is not the bottleneck. p  pThe question now is, wether it could help to instantiate the HTTP client only once and send all the records using the same connection. I did not find a solution to implement that, cause I need the saveorstore behavior of the code up here. p  pAnother solution could be not to transfer the records done after another but group them and create a new controller that accepts groups of my records to store them. p  pSo this questions boils down to a more architectural one than a technical. Either way I wonder if I can keep a HTTP connection open and speed up my solution that way. p  pAny ideasp  pRegards Felixp

Negative 1258 phoping some of you clever people can help me out herep  pWe have an ASP.NET web service app, using Entity Framework 1 and EFPocoAdapter. strongThe mem usage of the app pool running this web service keeps growing on every web service call.strong We currently monitor its mem usage and once it starts to get over 1GB we recycle the app pool to free up the memory.p  pstrongWe instantiate the object context in each web method in a using statement so that doesnt leave open object contexts observed with efprof.strongp  pSo I used Ants memory profiler 7 to track whats going on and after the first call to the web service at this point the EF framework generates its view, etc, Ive taken a snapshot. Then make the same call and take another snapshot. strongAnts shows that the new objects created since the last snapshot are pretty much all related to System.Data.Common.QueryCache.QueryCacheManager.strongp  pI know the point of the cache is to improve performance, but strongin our case I think we need to NOT cache every query planstrong as the likelihood of repeating those calls is minimal due to the nature of our main app  business.p  pSo, my question..... strongis there a way of turning off this cachingstrong, or am I barking up the wrong tree here and theres something else going on Im unaware ofp  pIve searched all over the web for an answer to this, and all I can find is the MergeOption property which seems to be related more to entity tracking for speed  performance improvements.p

Negative 1258 pI have a search dialog that I am popping up and filling with jquery templates. After they make a selection I set a value on the current page. As such I dont need hashTags or anything like that, I just need a popup dialog that I can open and close programatically. I am currently opening the dialog withp  precode.mobile.changePagedialog,  transition slide, changeHash false  codepre  pand closing it withp  precodedialog.dialogclose codepre  pHowever, in certain cases when the page is navigated to, closing the dialog refreshes the current page.p  pIs there a better way to interact with thisp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI think I figured out what is going on. So for some reason, jquery mobile usually keeps 2 pages loaded on the DOM  one of which is invisible, you can verify this by running [datarolepage] in the console. One page is the page youre on, the other is the page that you initially navigated to. Not quite sure why they choose to do that, but there you have it. p  pSo they treat dialogs as a page navigation with a different transition even if the dialog is already in the DOM. Therefore, if you go directly to the page and then trigger a dialog, modifying the current page and closing it works fine  because the original page is always loaded in the DOM. However if you go to another page, than navigate to the page that triggers the dialog, and THEN trigger the dialog it destroys the current page so that the pages in the DOM are the initial one and the dialog. In that case it reloads that dialoglaunching page entirely and you never get a chance to make any modifications.p  pJeez. How do I interact with the jqm dialog widget directlyp

When I add a new codeImageComboBoxcode on a winforms project rather advanced, the problem occurs  9 times out of 10 times or something like that.p  hr  pHeres the step to reproduce my twopixel problemp  ol liWhen I open the form, everythings finebr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwkKVU.png altFirst step  li liWhen I drop down the codeimageComboBoxcode, everythings finebr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlhjcn.png altSecond step  li liWhen I hover an item to select it, everythings finebr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAy1Wl.png altThird step  li liWhen I select an item, everythings finebr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comteQHh.png altFourth step  li liAnd when I drop down the codeimageComboBoxcode when there is an item selected, the problem occurs the image in front of the selected item is shifted by two pixels on the right and the text is shifted by one pixel on the leftbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnqziK.png altFifth stepbr Lets zoom img srchttpi.stack.imgur.come34u3.png altFifth step  zoomed  li liAnd here the proof I dont have the bug sometimesbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsRYtW.png altFifth step  no bugbr Lets zoom againbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEtRul.png altFifth step  no bug  zoomed li ol  hr  pHeres the codeDrawItemEventcode of my codeImageComboBoxcodebr codethis.imageListcode is my codeImageListcode objectp  precodeprivate void OnDrawItemobject sender, DrawItemEventArgs e      if e.Index gt 0           If the current item is one in the comboBox           Compute the X location of the text to drawn         int strLocationX  this.imageList.Images.Count gt e.Index                  this.imageList.Images[e.Index].Width  1                  e.Bounds.X  1           Get the displayed text of the current item         String itemText  this.Items[e.Index].ToString          if this.DroppedDown               If the comboBox is dropped down               Draw the blue rectangle             e.DrawBackground              if e.State  DrawItemState.ComboBoxEdit                   If we are drawing the selected item                   Draw the text                 e.Graphics.DrawStringitemText, this.Font, Brushes.Black,                      new PointstrLocationX  1, e.Bounds.Y  1                  if this.imageList.Images.Count gt e.Index                       If we have an image available                       Draw the image                     e.Graphics.DrawImagethis.imageList.Images[e.Index],                         new Pointe.Bounds.X, e.Bounds.Y  1                                else                   If we are drawing one of the item in the drop down                   Check if the item is being highlighted                 if e.State.ToString.ContainsDrawItemState.Focus.ToString ampamp                     e.State.ToString.ContainsDrawItemState.Selected.ToString                       Draw the text in White                     e.Graphics.DrawStringitemText, this.Font, Brushes.White,                          new PointstrLocationX, e.Bounds.Y  1                  else                       Draw the text in Black                     e.Graphics.DrawStringitemText, this.Font, Brushes.Black,                          new PointstrLocationX, e.Bounds.Y  1                                   if this.imageList.Images.Count gt e.Index                       If we have an image available                       Draw the image                     e.Graphics.DrawImagethis.imageList.Images[e.Index],                         new Pointe.Bounds.X  2, e.Bounds.Y  1                                        else               If the comboBox is not dropped down               Draw the text             e.Graphics.DrawStringitemText, this.Font, Brushes.Black,                  new PointstrLocationX  1, e.Bounds.Y  1              if this.imageList.Images.Count gt e.Index                   If we have an image available                   Draw the image                 e.Graphics.DrawImagethis.imageList.Images[e.Index],                     new Pointe.Bounds.X, e.Bounds.Y  1                             codepre  pFor my point of view, the code should be right, but it seems that sometimes the codeifcode conditions dont return the same results whereas I think it should do.p  pAny clue on where this problem could come fromp

Negative 1258 pI have a case in which there are 3 hosts A, B, and C. Host C periodically sends a heartbeat message to host B, which then sends a similar heartbeat message to A that contains all the information in the packet sent by C plus some additional stuff. Obviously, to enable this, A exposes a service to B, and B exposes a service to C. p  pThe serializable class being passed to both is called codeNodeInfocode. Basically just a simple collection of data members, codeNodeInfocode is referenced by the service definitions for both As and Bs services. p  pHeres the kicker the Data Contract received by B is of type codeB.ServiceForC.NodeInfocode. But the type that B needs to relay to A is of type codeA.ServiceForB.NodeInfocode. So what Im finding I need to do is write a lot of repetative code in B to copy data from the inbound codeNodeInfocodes to some newly created outbound codeNodeInfocodes. p  pMy question is, is there a clever way to handle this Is there a way to cast  a codeB.ServiceForC.NodeInfocode object to a codeA.ServiceForB.NodeInfocode object so I dont have to recreate all the objects and copy their data Since theyre not related in any hereditary sense it doesnt seem possible, but I dont know.p  pIve done a lot of hunting but cant seem to find anything that helps. Any suggestions, even if its a definitive youre outta luck, would be helpful. Thanks.p

Do not place the .htaccess file in the same directory where the uploaded files will be stored. It should be placed in the parent directory.

This will also prevent double extension attacks.  deny from all ltFiles  w.gifjpegpnggt order deny,allow allow from all ltFilesgt If possible, upload the files in a directory outside the server root. Prevent overwriting of existing files to prevent the .htaccess overwrite attack. Create a list of accepted mimetypes map extensions from these mime types. Generate a random file name and add the previously generated extension. Dont rely on clientside validation only, since it is not enough. Ideally one should have both serverside and clientside validation implemented. codepre  pSo that no other files than gif, jpg and png will be executed. But they dont want the htaccess to be in the folder where we upload images as that folder has permissions and htaccess can be overwritten.

Negative 1258 pI am trying to create a NUnit test for a project that uses Ninject.

I tried to call WebActivator by changing implementation of my Setup methodp  precode[SetUp] public void Setup      WebActivator.ActivationManager.Run  codepre  pIt doesnt work. As far As I understand underneath this call WebActivator should do something similar top  precodeforeach var assemblyFile in Directory.GetFilesHttpRuntime.BinDirectory, .dll      var assembly  Assembly.LoadFromassemblyFile     foreach PreApplicationStartMethodAttribute preStartAttrib in assembly.GetCustomAttributes         typeofPreApplicationStartMethodAttribute,         inherit false          preStartAttrib.InvokeMethod       codepre  pSo I guess that it is unable to find an assembly. So the question is  how can I order WebActivator to scan thru some additional assembly and fire some methods in a right time. Or maybe I am mislead here, and in order to test my Ninject project I should take a different approachp  pI am able to test my solutions wo WebActivator, but because it is widely used recently, I am keen to learn how to deal with it and force it to do things that I want.p

Negative 1258 pI seem to be having a memory leak issue when using spring, hibernate, and tiles for my webapp. I think this might be caused by my application not cleaning up after itself between deployments. I deploy and undeploy a lot, since Im currently just learning all of these frameworks.p  pWhat kind of things should I be doing to cleanup in my web application I currently do nothing because I thought Java automatically did memory cleaning, however Im pretty sure it doesnt do everything when it comes to spring since tomcat keeps complaining about permgen memory.p  pIm confused as to whether or not I need to be running certain methods in order to keep things clean. I read about a spring hook that registers the application somewhere, then when it shuts down the application is cleaned up properly I wasnt sure if something like that was necessary though in the new version of spring 3.1p  pFor example, tomcat keeps telling me that Im not properly unregistering the JDBC driver however I think tomcat does this automatically if it is detected.p  pI understand this is a hugely vague question, but if someone could mention certain things that need to be done to keep my application from leaking, I can google for them myself.p  pThanksp

It would be rotated about 110, 310.p  pWhat I have tried is thisp  precode voiddrawOtherViewInContextCGContextRefcontext atRectCGRectrect withRotationCGFloatrotation contextSizeCGSizecontextSize      CGRect thisFrame  ltSOLVEDFEATUREFRAMERELATIVETORECTSIZEgt     thisFrame.origin.y  contextSize.height  thisFrame.origin.y  thisFrame.size.height      CGRect rotatedRect  CGRectApplyAffineTransformCGRectMake0.0f, 0.0f, rect.size.width, rect.size.height, CGAffineTransformMakeRotationrotation      CGAffineTransform transform  CGAffineTransformIdentity     transform  CGAffineTransformTranslatetransform, rect.origin.x, contextSize.height  rect.origin.y  rect.size.height     transform  CGAffineTransformTranslatetransform,                                             rotatedRect.size.width2.0f,                                             rotatedRect.size.height2.0f     transform  CGAffineTransformRotatetransform, rotation     transform  CGAffineTransformTranslatetransform,                                             rect.size.width2.0f,                                             rect.size.height2.0f      CGContextConcatCTMcontext, transform     CGContextDrawImagecontext, thisFrame, theCGImageToDraw     CGContextConcatCTMcontext, CGAffineTransformInverttransform  codepre  pSo what I am doing there, I think, is thisp  ol lipTranslate to the bottom left of coderectcode which is where this view is meant to be drawn.pli lipTranslate by half the rotated size in x and y.pli lipRotate by the required angle.pli lipTranslate back half the original size in x and y.pli ol  pI thought that this would be what I wanted to do because the first step translates the coordinate system to be such that codethisFramecode is drawn correctly relative to where were being told to draw by the coderectcode method parameter.

Negative 1258 pI am developing an app for the iphone. One of my views contains a textbox that I used to display text. I used storyboard to do this. To better explain, this view will show the user  the history of a football team. E.g  the team was established in 1990 etc and give a full history of the team.  So there will be no user interaction. The reader will only read the text and move on to the next page. Is using a textbox for the text a good idea And is there anyway to justify the alignment of the text so the ends of the lines are all allignedp

Negative 1258 pThanks to strongTimiz0rstrong, Ive solved this issue, but its multistep so Im detailing the full solution here the original question is below. First, I changed my ILS function to be simplyp  precodePublic Overrides Function InitializeLifetimeService As Object     Return Nothing End Function codepre  pThen I included this in my strongProgramstrong as well as strongAstrong. As strongTimiz0rstrong pointed out, emFormem inherits emMarshalByRefObjectem, so I didnt have to include a Inherits statement on my main class which already inherited emFormem. This was the big thing, because I didnt include it originally.  Next, I changed my AppDomain setup to bep  precodeDim ADomain As AppDomain  AppDomain.CreateDomainName Dim item As New A item  CTypeADomain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrapGetTypeA.Assembly.FullName, GetTypeA.FullName, A codepre  pWith these changes I can now use separate instances of the DLL COM object as desired.p  h2Original Questionh2  hr  pI am writing an application that creates a list of objects, each referring to a DLL, and each object placed in its own AppDomain to keep the instances of the DLL from interfering with each other.  Taken another wayp  ol listrongProgramstrong maintains a strongListOf Astrongli listrongAstrong is created as an instance of strongAppDomainstrong using emCreateInstanceAndUnwrapemli liEach strongAstrong refers to strongmirror.dllstrong, which is including in the applications referencesli ol  pAll of this is fine and dandy except that when setting up the Domain, the call to InitializeLifetimeService is not respected... kind of.  After waiting the default 5 minutes and making a call to one of my As, I get the RemoteException error.  However, putting in some TryCatch statements I discovered that I emcanem reach the A in question, but it fails when it tries to RaiseEvent.  In addition, it seems that the DLL object itself is dropped or it also fails when trying to RaiseEvent, which it does often. p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.appdomain.initializelifetimeservice.aspx relnofollowAccording to this articlea, the override in AppDomain should automatically create a lease that doesnt expire. So I try thisp  precodeADomain  AppDomain.CreateDomainName ADomain.InitializeLifetimeService Dim item As A item  CTypeADomain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrapGetTypeA.Assembly.FullName, GetTypeA.FullName, A codepre  pNo dice.  According to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary23bk23zc.aspx relnofollowanother MSDN articlea, overriding InitializeLifetimeService and returning Nothing will do the same thing.  So, within the A Class, I dop  precodeltSecurityPermissionAttributeSecurityAction.Demand,                                   FlagsSecurityPermissionFlag.Infrastructuregt  Public Overrides Function InitializeLifetimeService As Object     Return Nothing End Function codepre  pYet again, nothing happens. So, going by a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.marshalbyrefobject.initializelifetimeservice28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowyet another articlea, I try to just set a long leasep  precodeltSecurityPermissionAttributeSecurityAction.Demand,                                   FlagsSecurityPermissionFlag.Infrastructuregt  Public Overrides Function InitializeLifetimeService As Object     Dim lease As ILease  CTypeMyBase.InitializeLifetimeService, ILease     If lease.CurrentState  LeaseState.Initial Then         lease.InitialLeaseTime  TimeSpan.FromDays5         lease.SponsorshipTimeout  TimeSpan.FromDays5         lease.RenewOnCallTime  TimeSpan.FromDays5     End If     Return lease End Function codepre  pPart of the problem for this seems to be that I never get A in the Initial state. But that shouldnt be an issue if I use the previous setup and always return Nothing, right Unfortunately, theres very little out there in the way of examples for doing this kind of thing, so I may well be doing something wrong.  Im all ears for how I should approach this, the entire project is for naught if I cant get over this problem.p  pI should probably mention that the third party, closed source DLL is not serializable and is highly unlikely to inherit MarshalByRefObject. This is why I put the class into the AppDomain and not the DLL, but may be part of the problem.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2410221appdomainandmarshalbyrefobjectlifetimehowtoavoidremotingexceptionThis questiona might be related, but the setup is different from what Im doing and its for C, which Im having a tad trouble converting to VB in my head.p

Negative 1258 pRight now I use Flurry for all my in app analytics needs. Im starting to add features involving services and broadcast receivers. I want to track events within these components, but I dont want to start a new session in Flurry based on these passive events. From what I can tell, the only way to track events in Flurry is to track them between the start and end of a session. Essentially I want to see if people using the new features boost my session count. p  pOne idea Im thinking about is passing the passive event parameters in my intents to the Activities. Then including those with every active event that normally gets sent to Flurry for that session.p  pIs this a good approach Is there a better way with Flurry or even a better toolp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI got a response from Flurry, but not the one I was hoping forp  blockquote   pWe currently do not support the sending of events from within a BroadcastReceiver on Android.

Negative 1258 pI recently encountered a hairpulling situation in my iOS app, where I was trying to successively dismiss one presented codeUIViewControllercode from my windows rootViewController, usingp  precode[rootViewController dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES completionNULL] codepre  pand present another one shortly thereafter in another method, incidentally, withp  precodeUIViewController vc2  [[[MyViewController2 alloc] initWithNibNamenil bundlenil] autorelease] [rootViewController presentViewControllervc2 animatedYES completionNULL] codepre  pProblem was, I could never get the second view controller to show up.  Turns out, as near as I can tell, codedismissViewControllerAnimatedcompletioncode needs that asynchronous block of completion time to pass, before codepresentViewControlleranimatedcompletioncode will work properly again.  This fact is not directly documented in a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosfeaturedarticlesViewControllerPGforiPhoneOSModalViewControllersModalViewControllers.htmlApples docsa, from what I can tell.p  pThe solution I came up with was to wrap the dismissal with a method that specifies the selector you would want to call afterwards, like sop  precode voiddismissViewControllerUIViewController presentingController                    postActionSELpostDismissalAction      [presentingController dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES                                              completion                                                             [self performSelectorOnMainThreadpostDismissalAction                                                                                    withObjectnil                                                                                 waitUntilDoneNO]                                                          ]  codepre  pAnd then I would callp  precode[self dismissViewControllerself.window.rootViewController                  postActionselectormethodForNextModalPresentation] codepre  pAnyway, I wanted to post, as I looked around and hadnt seen anyone with this particular problem, so I thought it might be useful for people to understand.  And also, I wanted to verify that Im not hacking a solution that has a better design pattern for resolution.p

Negative 1258 pLets say we have a requirement to create a system that consumes a highvolume, realtime data stream of documents, and that matches those documents against a set of userdefined search queries as those documents become available.  This is a prospective, as opposed to a retrospective, search service.  What would be an appropriate persistence solutionp  pSuppose that users want to see a live feed of documents that match their queriesthink Google Alertsand that the feed must display certain metadata for each document.  Lets assume an indefinite lifespan for matches i.e., the system will allow the user to see all of the matches for a query from the time when the particular query was created.  So the metadata for each document that comes in the stream, and the associations between the document and the user queries that matched that document, must be persisted to a database.p  pLets throw in another requirement, that users want to be able to facet on some of the metadata e.g., the user wants to see only the matching documents for a particular query whose metadata field result type equals blog, and wants a count of the number of blog matches.p  pHere are some hypothetical numbersp  ol lip200,000 new documents in the data stream every day.p  pThe metadata for every document is persisted.pli lip1000 users with about 5 search queries each about 5000 total user search queries.p  pThese queries are simple boolean queries.p  pAs each new document comes in, it is processed against all 5000 queries to see which queries are a match.pli lipEach feedone for each user queryis refreshed to the user every minute.  In other words, for every feed, a query to the database for the most recent page of matches is performed every minute.pli ol  pSpeed in displaying the feed to the user is of paramount importance.  Scalability and high availability are essential as well.p  pThe relationship between users and queries is relational, as is the relationship between queries and matching documents, but the document metadata itself are just keyvalue pairs.  So my initial thought was to keep the relational data in a relational DB like MySQL and the metadata in a NoSQL DB, but can the faceting requirement be achieved in a NoSQL DB  Also, constructing a feed would then require making a call to two separate data stores, which is additional complexity.  Or perhaps shove everything into MySQL, but this would entail lots of joins and counts.  If we store all the data as keyvalue pairs in some other kind of data store, again, how would we do the faceting  And there would be a ton of redundant metadata for documents that match more than one search query.p  pWhat kind of databases would be a good fit for this scenario  Im aware of tools such as a hrefhttpsgithub.comnathanmarzstorm relnofollowTwitter Storma and Yahoos a hrefhttpincubator.apache.orgs4 relnofollowS4a, which could be used to construct the overall architecture of such a system, but Id like to focus on the database, given the data storage, volume, and queryfaceting requirements.p

Negative 1258 pI searched before but couldnt find any answers. I am somewhat new to c, so hopefully this question wont be too stupid.p  pI am trying to add and remove elements in a vector, in my case populated with particles during a big update or drawing loop over all particles. For example remove some particles because they died, but also add a few other ones because one particle collided with an object and I want to show a small particle burst at the point of collision. I made this simple test code in a demo file to get to the bottom of the problem. p  pI think the problem is since I delete and add particles the iterator pointer becomes invalid. Deletion works, but when I add a few random ones I get a null pointer. the code below is somewhat verbose, I know I should use iterators with begin and end but I had the same problem with those, and played with the code a bit, trying more javascript array style looping because I am more familiar with that.p  precodevoid testAppdrawParticles       int i0     int max  particles.size     vectorltParticlegtiterator it  particles.begin      while  i lt max            Particle  p  particles[i]          if  ofRandom1 gt .9               it  particles.eraseit             max  particles.size          else              ofSetColor255, 255, 0             ofCircle pgtx, pgty, pgtz, 10              if  ofRandom1 lt .1  addSomeNewOnes             i             it                   void testAppaddSomeNewOnes      int max  ofRandom4      for  int i0 iltmax i           Particle  p  new Particle         pgtx  ofRandom ofGetWidth2, ofGetWidth2          pgty  ofRandom ofGetHeight2, ofGetHeight2          pgtz  ofRandom ofGetHeight2, ofGetHeight2          particles.pushback p        codepre

Negative 1258 pIve got a problem at work that requires me to insheet some MASSIVE tabseparated values files think 815 GB .txt files into my PostgreSQL DB, but Ive run into a problem with the way the data was formatted in the first place. Basically, the way we are given the data and unfortunately we cannot get the data in a better format, there are some backslashes that appear and cause a returnnew line. p  pSo, there are lines rows of data, tabdelim that get chopped up into multiple lines, where the last character of line n is a  , and the first character of line n1 is a tab. Usually line n will be broken up into 13 additional lines e.g. line n ends in a , lines n1 and n2 start with a tab and end with a , and line n3 starts with a tab. p  pI need to write a script that can work with these huge files this will run on a linux server with 192 GB of RAM to look for the lines that begin with a tab, and then remove the return and  wherever it exists and save the text file. p  pTo recap, the customers logging program splits the original line N into lines n, n1, and sometimes n2 and n3 depending on how many  characters appear in line N, and I need to write a python script to recreate the original line N.p

Negative 1258 pIve started using git with a small dev team of people who come and go on different projects it was working well enough until we started working with Wordpress.  Because Wordpress stores a lot of configurations in MySQL, we decided we needed to include that in our commits.  p  pThis worked well enough using msyql dump on precommits, and pushing the dumped file into mysql on postcheckout until two people made modifications to plugins and committed, then everything broke again.p  pIve looked at every solution I could find, and thought Liquibase was the closest option, but wouldnt work for us.  It requires you to specify schema in XML, which isnt really possible because we are using plugins which insert datatablesmodifications automatically into the DB.br I plan on putting a bounty on it in a few days to see if anyone has the goldilocks solution ofp  pstrongThe questionstrongbr Is there a way to version control a MySQL database semantically not using diffs EDIT meaning that it doesnt just take the two versions and diff it, but instead records the actual queries run in sequence to get from the old version to the current one without the requirement of a developer written schema file, and one that can be merged using git.p  pI know I cant be the only one with such a problem, but hopefully there is somebody with a solutionp

Negative 1258 pI have an rdlc report created in vs.net 2010 that requires the use of the lookup function available in reporting services 2008 R2 I just assumed it would be available in the rdlc file. This local report uses custom business objects and functionality already available within a web application, so I dont think it can be converted to a server report. The employee dataset is a list of employee objects, each object containing financial data along with office and department properties. The report is grouped by office, then department, then employee, with each employee displaying financial details. However, there is a special employee for each office that I need to display, but not include in the list of all other employees. This information needs to be displayed at the end of each offices information and I had planned on simply adding a new row to the report and using the lookup function from the employee dataset against another dataset containing the financial data for this special employee. This special employee is of the same type as a normal employee, so the lookup would be based on the office property. p  pSo my question is, am I overlooking something or is the lookup function truly not available in the rdlc files created using vs.net 2010 If its not available, any suggestions on how I might achieve this kind of lookup functionalityp  pThanks,p  pEricp

After that, for each node it must read one block per level, which will contain the two consecutive child nodes.

Negative 1258 pIm trying to develop fully standalone server that would be able to upgrade themselves without any human intervention. To be more acute, here are the requirements      Every nights the server checks for updates on a specified server br     When a upgrade is available, it downloads a new configuration file or something     Then the server proceeds its upgrade but if anything goes wrong internet connection is lost or something is badly downloaded the server rolls back to its previous configuration.p  pIn fact we dont really care if the server isnt up to date but we want to be sure that its still running even in a old version. Ive looked for configuration management system and found fancy tools like Puppet. But, for instance, if puppet cant download a new debian package, the update will failed and theres a risk that the server cant fullfil its task.p  pSo i was wondering, do I have to check if every packages are correctly downloaded before launching the upgrade or is there any fancy tools that can do it for me and rollback if needed p  pOne point is very important, once a server is deploy, we cant have any access to it. Thats why its better to have it running in an older version than to have it not running.p  pI hope that youll understand my issue, sorry for my englishp  pJulianp

However, I now have to click on an anchor tag to display the popover.. and then it doesnt go away after that either.

Negative 1258 pI just started working with the Boost ASIO library, version 1.52.0.  I am using TCPSSL encryption with async sockets.  From other questions asked here about ASIO, it seems that ASIO does not support receiving a variable length message and then passing the data for that message to a handler.p  pIm guessing that ASIO puts the data into a cyclical buffer and loses all track of each separate message.  If I have missed something and ASIO does provide a way to pass individual messages, then please advise as to how.p  pMy question is that assuming I cant somehow obtain just the bytes associated with an individual message, can I use transferexactly in asyncread to obtain just the first 4 bytes, which our protocol always places the length of the message.  Then call either read or asyncread if read wont work with async sockets to read in the rest of the message  Will this work  Any better ways to do itp

Negative 1258 pThere is a new method supported in Android from API level 11 for extending the lifetime of the broadcast receiver.p  pIt is goAsync and new class BroadcastReceiever.PendingResult.p  pOur scenario is  When we receive the broadcast receiver for incoming call, We show a activity as dialog with accept recordingdecline option.  Based on the user input, we need to decide either to connectdisconnect the call.  The ISSUE is that we need to ensure that broadcast receiver on receive is blocked till we get the user input and how we can pass the user input from activity dialog back to broadcast receiver. p  pThis is similar scenario as in post which is not completely answered [link] a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6401964waitforuserinputbeforeplacingoutgoingcallWait for user input before placing outgoing calla From the above post we got to know that this can be achieved using the goAsync and BroadcastReceiver.PendingResult.

Negative 1258 pIve looked at a number of sources for C11s new regex library, but most of them focus more on the syntax, or the more basic usage of things like regexmatch, or regexsearch. While these articles helped me get started using the regex library, Im having a difficult time finding more details on capture groups.p  pWhat Im trying to accomplish, is find out which capture group a match belongs to.

Therefore, to find out which capture group a match belongs to, I can simply iterate through the capture groups to find out which matches are not thrown away for a particular group.p  pemHoweverem, this would be undesirable for me, because unless theres some caching going on in the background I would expect each construction of codestdsregextokeniteratorcode to pass over the input and find the matches again someone please correct me if this is wrong, but this is the best conclusion I could come to.p  pstrongIs there any better way of finding the capture groups a match belongs to Or is iterating over the submatches the best course of actionstrongp

Negative 1258 pSo, Im trying to understand the dynamic programming algorithm for finding the minimum weighted triangulation decomposition of a convex polygon. For those of you that dont know, triangulation is where we take a convex polygon, and break it up into triangles. The minimum weighted triangulation is the triangulation of a polygon where the sum of all the edgesor perimeter of every triangle is the smallest.p  pIts actually a fairly common algorithm, however I just cant grasp it. Here is the algorithm Im trying to understandp  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMinimumweighttriangulationVariations relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMinimumweighttriangulationVariationsap  pHeres another description Im trying to followScroll down to 5.2 Optimal Triangulationsp  pa hrefhttpvalis.cs.uiuc.edusarielteachnotesalgoslec05dprogII.pdf relnofollowhttpvalis.cs.uiuc.edusarielteachnotesalgoslec05dprogII.pdfap  pSo I understand this much so far. I take all my vertices, and make sure they are in clockwise order around the perimeter of the original polygon. I make a function that returns the minimum weight triangulation, which I call MWTi, j of a polygon starting at vertex i and going to vertex j. This function will be recursive, so the first call should be MWT0, n1, where n is the total number of vertices. MWT should test all the triangles that are made of the points i, j, and k, where k is any vertex between those. Heres my code so farp  precodedef MWTi, j     if j lt i return 0     elif j  i1 return 0      cheapcost  floatinfinity     for k in rangei, j         cheapcost  mincheapcost, costvertices[i], vertices[j], vertices[k]  MWTi, k  MWTk, j     return cheapcost codepre  pHowever when I run it it overflows the stack. Im just completely lost and would appreciate if somebody could help direct me in the right direction.p  pIf you guys need any more info just ask.p
Negative 1258 pI am creating an Overlay Screen. Everything works perfect on it except the android 4.0 default keyboards backkeyboard down,home amp recent apps button when the keyboard is open. These keys do not take the touch and instead the keys above it are being tapped. For example when tapped on back the comma is getting tapped, when tapped home the space key is being tapped etc.p  pThe issue is seen with the android default keyboard from 4.0 onwards only since the samsung devices which have their own keyboard implementation do not show this issue also when in landscape mode the default keyboard works normally but then the keyboard is in full screen mode.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5hw54.png altenter image description herep  pI am not sure if the fault is in the keyboard implementation or in mine.

Negative 1258 pSo for my application, I add a view aView on top of my current view classesWebView as a Subview. All the aView is, is a UIView with a UIActivityIndicatorView on top of it that is supposed to animate while the view underneath classesWebView loads the appropriate Web Page. p  pI can see that the classesWebView webpage does appear aView has an alpha of .5, but as soon as it finishes loading all the way, aView is sent [aView removeFromSuperview] and it disappears but after it goes away, all thats left is a white screen in its place.p  pI have done this for two other methods and I dont know why, on only this method, it refuses to cooperate. p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated. The App is for iOS 6. p  pviewDidLoad methodp  precodevoidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      classesWebView.delegate  self      [classesWebView addSubviewaView]      NSURL class  [NSURL URLWithStringmywebistelink]       NSURLRequest classRequest  [NSURLRequest requestWithURLclass]       [classesWebView loadRequestclassRequest]     codepre  pwebViewDidStartLoad methodp  ppreView and switchView are Activity Indicators.p  precode voidwebViewDidStartLoadUIWebView  webview      [UIApplication sharedApplication].networkActivityIndicatorVisible  YES      ifaView.superview  nil              [preView startAnimating]          else              [switchView startAnimating]       codepre  pwebViewDidFinishLoad methodp  precode voidwebViewDidFinishLoadUIWebView  webview      [UIApplication sharedApplication].networkActivityIndicatorVisible  NO      ifaView.superview  nil              [aView removeFromSuperview]         [preView stopAnimating]         [preView setOpaquefalse]          else              [switchView stopAnimating]         [switchView setOpaquefalse]       codepre  p[Further clarity The reason I have the ifstatement, is because I want another indicator for the classesWebView when loading pages but I do NOT want it to appear unless aView is gone since aView already has its on indicator preView]p  pEDIT Just to prove that it is ONLY THE removeFromSuperview that is causing the problem, if I call [aView setAlpha0.0] it disappears and the webPage below it loads properly. But the second that I call [aView removeFromSuperview] the web page turns into a white screen. TTp

Negative 1258 pOk this has been bothering me for a while now and I couldnt quite find the problem on Google.p  pSo I have a table with 1 column. In this column, there are either rows with a textbox or with a dropdownlist. What I want now is that these controls have the same width. So I set the Width of the controls to 100. The result however is that the dropdownlists are like 510px shorter than the textboxes.  I have tried setting p  precodeWidth100 codepre  pas well as p  precodestylewidth 100 codepre  pBut no success there. In the Visual Studio designer, the width is correct for all controls. But in Firefox, Chrome or even IE, the dropdownlists are shorter.p  pSuggestions please p

Negative 1258 pI have an MVC4 application with Entity Framework for the data access.  My application has seemed to perform pretty well until thus far, when one of the pages is returning about 13,000 rows, and the connection is timing out.  Plus, after I try to run the page that returns the 13,000 rows, the rest of the site starts going really slow as well. Although I am using a fairly complicated linq query, Im using the Stack Exchange miniprofiler, and using the sql from this, Ive determined my query is taking less than a second verified by running the generated sql from the LINQ query in SSMS directly maybe 2 seconds, top.  The profiler will say something like T0.97ms, Reader 10393ms for even a small returned result set.  It will get back to normal eventually.p  pIve looked around with little success for documentation on what the READER statement is telling me.  Does this mean that the is the time it takes to stream the results back to the web server  Anyways, if anybody has any idea what could be going on here Id appreciate it greatly.  I can post the LINQ code if anyone wants it, but like I said, Im pretty confident the SQL its generating is good.p  pThanksp  pEdit  One thing I might mention  this is in a shared hosting environment running under medium trust.

Negative 1258 pm working on the backend of a mobile app, building a RESTful API using ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Api. The app will run on iOS and Android. My users will be allowed to login only with their facebook account, and only when logged in, they will be able to use the whole functionality.p  pI dont have much experience with mobile apps and thats more of a design question Which of the two scenarios or maybe a third one seems better design to you about who should be responsible for the facebook authenticationp  ol liThe mobile client is responsible. Without accessing the backend, it speaks directly with facebook, allowing user to enter his credentials and when it gets the token from facebook, then it hits the backend for first time, passing the token to it in every request.li liThe backend API is responsible. Mobile client tries to access a resource from it. Backend gets no authentication token from client, so it redirects to facebook login. User enters credentials and facebook replies back to the backend passing the token. Then, backend is willing to answer to the client response about the desired resource.li ol  pOf course, 2nd scenario means the backend should use a package like a hrefhttpsnuget.orgpackagesDotNetOpenAuth relnofollowDotNetOpenAutha to handle OAuth, while in the 1st scenario, these all happen in mobile client.p

Negative 1258 pI have a form in my program that has two drop downs and three buttons. When I run the form, I want the two drop downs to be blank, and one of the buttons to be disabled. I had this setup and working fine, but I have since been working on other classes and forms in the program and, coming back to refine some things, I have found that the code no longer works. The lines in particular arep  precodeprivate void mainFormLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      this.roomsTableAdapter.Fillthis.bookingSystemDatabaseDataSet.rooms     timeBox.ResetText     roomBox.ResetText     updateTextOutput     bookButton.Enabled  false  codepre  pThe first line uses a TableAdapter to fill the associated rooms drop down box, which works, however the code after this line does not seem to be executed at all. Commenting out the line means that they are executed, but obviously my rooms drop down would be empty. I have tried moving the lines to the main execution point of the form, but the same thing happens.p  pFurthermore, I have tried to fill the rooms drop down in other ways, includingp  precoderoomBox.DataSource  roomsTableAdapter.FillbookingSystemDatabaseDataSet.rooms codepre  pandp  precoderoomsTableAdapter.FillbookingSystemDatabaseDataSet.rooms roomBox.DataSource  roomsTableAdapter codepre  pOf course, these attempts are very similar, but I figured Id give it a shot. As it turns out, the exact same thing happens in each case the roomBox is filled, then the rest of the code is ignored. Debugging by stepping through backs up what I already thought to be true, the code is not even executed as far as I can tell. There are no errors, and the program runs, so why are these lines being ignoredp

Negative 1258 pThe most frequent crash were seeing from customers is an exception 0xbbadbeef always in WebThread, thread 2 from WebTryThreadLock. Usually the crashes contain other threads main thread included that has nothing specific to do with our code. We cant reproduce it internally. Weve looked in cases in our code where we might be using UIWebViews from other threads but weve found nothing. We always unset the webviews delegate before its freed.p  pWe see this from all kinds of devices and from what I can see any iOS version in the 5.xcurrent range.

This deleted my target, which apparently cannot be reversed.p  pSo I created a new target with the same name as the old one and had it point to my project file. But when I run my program, it just shows a blank white screen. I checked MainStoryboard.storyboard to find that it had deleted all of my storyboards. Is there any way for me to recover my old MainStoryboard Or my old Target Ive been trying for the last 30 minutes, looking stuff up online, nothing has worked.p  pI have an archive of the project from RIGHT before this happened. Is it possible to restore my project from that archive I havent created a snapshot since a couple of weeks ago this was probably stupid of me so reverting to a snapshot isnt an option.p  pAny help you can offer me would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1258 hr  h2EDIT Looks like this post is much ado about nothing, as the OPTIONS preflighting was introduced late last fall my problems have been more user error than anything. See comments for more details Ill leave it all here for documentations sake. jlmh2  hr  pIts a known issue that the Youtube API does not support the OPTIONS request method, so any web app that tries to do a CrossOrigin preflight will fail, even if as is the case with the Youtube API the actual CORS request would succeed. As weve been facing this issue yet again this week, weve come up with three workarounds however, each has its own plusses and minuses. p  pstrongPOSSIBLE WORKAROUND 1 Forget the preflight, and just make the simple crossorigin request.strongp  pemBenefitsem  A it works. B this is all the specification requires when doing most GET or POST requests.p  pemDrawbacksem  A The specification states that any PATCH, PUT, or DELETE requests, along with POST requests that use a contenttype other than formdata, urlencoded, or textplain,  need to be preflighted. So while it would work, it would be breaking the spec which wed like to avoid if possible. B Preflighting is also necessary when setting custom headers so, for example, when I use AngularJSs http method in the 1.0 branch, it sets a custom header and thus triggers preflighting of even GET requests. In this case, of course, I could write my own http service or move to the 1.1 branch as the problem would really be on Angluars end.p  pstrongPOSSIBLE WORKAROUND 2 Use JSONPstrongp  pemBenefitsem  A it works, too in some cases, anyway. B Its fairly simple to set up.p  pemDrawbacksem  A An older technology, and it isnt clear if the Youtube API will continue to support JSONP. B Requires a callback. C Is limited to GET requests only.p  pstrongPOSSIBLE WORKAROUND 3 Set up a serverside proxy on the same domain, use it to communicate with the Youtube API.strongp  pemBenefitsem  A Avoids the need to do CORS requests at all, since the client works on the same origin and the serverside proxy has no need to preflight anything.p  pemDrawbacksem  A Can get complicated to set up, especially if trying to work with credentials oAuth2 through a proxy can be quite the beast.p  pSo that this post has an actual question or several, actuallyp  ol liWhat take do you have for better for worse on any or all of the workarounds aboveli liHas anyone implemented other solutionsli liIs there any information as to ifwhen the Youtube servers might support the OPTIONS methodli ol  pAny and all comments are welcome  and I apologize in advance if this isnt the best forum for such a question although Im hoping that by putting it here on Stack Overflow, itll prove useful to others facing the same issuep

I tried manually setting the registry key in HKEYLOCALMACHINE but I am still hitting the roadblock when my service is run.  Is this the correct place to change registry keys so that the local system account will see them  Any knowledge on the subject would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 1258 pI have plotted a waveform left channel of audio file on a canvas inside a scroll viewer. I would like the canvas with the waveform as its content to move across the scrollviewers visible window. The point of this is to be able to watch the waveform move across the screen and even though the audio file being plotted may be several minutes long, only a window of specified time is visible a minute clip, perhaps. I would like it bound to a clock, so that when the clock starts, the waveform begins to move or alternatively, the scroll viewers horizontal offset advances. I used Naudio to plot the waveform, using C amp WPF. The plotted waveform is the graph of all the bytes in the file sampled every 100 milliseconds. How do I keep the clock and the viewwindow in sync Any help or place to start would be appreciated as this is my first project working with this sort of thing. Thanks.p

I am using PaintCode which up until now has worked like a charm to draw the code, then I changed the size of the gradient from code[UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect CGRectMake0, 0, 240, 120 cornerRadius 4]code to code[UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect CGRectMake0, 0,  self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height cornerRadius 4]code because the size of the button changes between 4.5 and 5 devices.

Negative 1258 pbeen trying to solve this problem for a week and couldnt come up with any solutions in all my research so I thought Id ask you all.p  pI have a Product table and a productSent table, heres a quick scheme to help explainp  precodeclass Productndb.Model   name  ndb.StringProperty   rating  ndb.IntegerProperty  class productSentndb.Model lt the key name here is md5Product KeyUUID   pId  ndb.KeyPropertykindProduct   uuId  ndb.KeyPropertykinduserData   action  ndb.StringProperty   date  ndb.DateTimePropertyautonowaddTrue codepre  pMy goal is to show users the highest rated product that theyve never seen beforefast. So to keep track of the products users have seen, I use the productSent table. I created this table instead of using Cursors because every time the rating order changes, theres a possibility that the cursor skips the new higher ranking product. An example assume the user has seen products 124 in the db. Next, 5 users liked product 25, making it the 10 product in the databaseIm worried that the product will never be shown again to the user and possibly mess things up on a higher scale.p  pThe problem with the way Im doing it right now is that, once the user has blown past the first 1,000 products, it really starts slowing down the query performance. Because Im literally pulling 1,000 results, checking if theyve been sent by querying against the productSent table doing a keyName lookup to speed things up and going through the loop until 15 new ones have been detected.p  pOne solution I thought of was to add a repeated property listProperty to the Product table of all the users who have seen a product. Or if I dont want to have inequality filters I could put a repeated property of all the users who havent seen a product. That way when I query I can dynamically take those out. But Im afraid of what happens when I have 1,000 usersp  pa Ill go through the roof on the limit of repeated properties in one entity.  b The index size will increase size costsp  pHas anyone dealt with this problem before Im sure someone has Any tips on the best way to structure itp  pstrongupdatestrong Okay, so had another idea. In order to minimize the changes that take place when a rating number of likes changes, I could have a secondary column that only has 3 possible values positive, neutral, negative. And sort by that Ofcourse for items that have a rating of 0 and get a like making them a positive would still have a chance of being out of order or skipped by the cursorbut itd be less likely.

Negative 1258 pIm currently working on a webbased height map generator with Three.js. I use one canvas to show the actual generated height map, several others for displaying the separate octaves the height map consists of and another one for demonstrating the height map in action where it is applied directly to a plane mesh.p  pSo far so good. The whole stuff also renders perfectly fine with all the predefined parameters wavelength, etc.. The actual problem is, that the canvasses arent updating after the initial render pass which makes my program completely useless since the purpose of my program is to be able to manipulate the several parameters of the height map with sliders and see the effects in real time.p  pSadly the only canvas that updates at all is the one with the real 3D scene with the plane mesh. But also here it kind of seems like the data from the first render pass never got cleared, but at least it seems the uniforms for the noise parameters are updated correctly  this is obviously not the case for all the other canvasses.p  pBefore I finally render a scene, I always set the codeneedsUpdatecode field of the meshes material to codetruecode, but it only seems to work for that one canvas that got initialized last. Im completely lost here and also wasnt able to find any information about that issue.p

Also I am not really sure if codeonExitcode would be different for 3 classes and codeonCrushingcode would perform the same function. p  pI tried my best to explain the question clearly...if you dont understand free free to comment. Thank you very muchp

Negative 1258 pUsing Grunt I was wondering if there were some existing build process to precompile serverside templates. Actually with usual template engines, you often use features like include, extend layout.html, ...br This means you could be able to just precompile your template doing all stuff that can be  statically solve. For example with a hrefhttpectjs.com relnofollowecta and the include featurep  ul lia.ectli ul  pcodeltdivgtHello Im lt name gtltdivgtlt include b.ect gtcodep  ul lib.ectli ul  pcodeltdivgtIm included in a.ectltdivgtcodep  pSince there is no conditional dynamic statement to decide if the emb.ectem block has to be included, ema.ectem could be statically compiled including emb.ectem into em.dista.ectembrp  pcodeltdivgtHello Im lt name gtltdivgtltdivgtIm included in a.ectltdivgtcodep  pAs you can see, em.dista.ectem is still a template, and the name variable stills need to be  provided, so in this case, this part remains unchanged. However, the inclusion is static so it can be done right now avoiding the useless inclusion strongat runtimestrong even with a cachep  pUsing this approach, we could even think about minifying templates during this build process, and more. For the minifying task, I am aware of tools like htmlmin but this is oriented for valid html.p  pIve also found some grunt tasks a hrefhttpsnpmjs.orgpackagegruntect relnofollowgruntecta, a hrefhttpsnpmjs.orgpackagegruntcontribjade relnofollowgruntcontribjadea, etc which compiles your templates into html by providing the context. However it seems that it expects to get all the dynamic parts of your templates i.e. the value of all variables.p  pAny idea if this kind of emprecompilationem tool already exists for a template engine even without gruntp  pPS This could be a bad approach, so any advice is welcome.p

Negative 1258 pThis may be better suited to server fault but I thought Id ask here first.p  pWe have a file that is prepended to every PHP file on our servers using autoprepend that contains a class called codeBootstrapcode that we use for autoloading, environment detection, etc. Its all working fine.p  pHowever, when there is an OUT OF MEMORY error directly preceding i.e., less than a second or even at the same time a request to another file on the same server, one of three things happensp  ol lipOur code for checking codeifclassexistsBootstrapcode, which we used to wrap the class definition when we first got this error, returns codetruecode, meaning that class has already been declared despite this being the autoprepend file.pli lipWe get a cannot redeclare class Bootstrap error from our autoprepended file, meaning that codeclassexistsBootstrapcode returned codefalsecode but it somehow was still declared.pli liThe file is not prepended at all, leading to a onetime fatal error for files that depend on it.li ol  pWe could of course try to fix the out of memory issues since those seem to be causing the other errors, but for various reasons they are unfixable in our setup or very difficult to fix. But thats besides the point  it seems to me that this is a bug in PHP with some sort of memory leak causing issues with the autoprepend directive.p  pThis is more curiosity than anything since this rarely happens maybe once a week on our hightraffic servers. But Id like to know  why is this happening, and what can we do to fix itp  pWere running FreeBSD 9.2 with PHP 5.4.19.p  pEDIT A few things weve noticed while trying to fix this over the past few monthsp  ul lipIt seems to only happen on our secure servers. The out of memory issues are predominantly on our secure servers theyre usually from our own employees trying to download too much data, so it could just be a coincidence, but it deserves pointing outpli lipThe dump of codegetdeclaredclassescode when we have this issue contains classes that are not used on the page that is triggering the error. For example, the output of codeSERVERcode says the person is on xyz.com, but one of the declared classes is only used in abc.com, which is where the out of memory issues usually originate from.pli lipAll of this leads me to believe that PHP is not doing proper endofcycle garbage collection after getting an out of memory error, which causes the codeBootstrapcode class to either be entirely or partly in memory on the next page request if its soon enough after the error. Im not familiar enough with PHP garbage collection to actually act on this, but I think this is most likely the issue.pli ul

And if I add the the DefaultStyledDocument after setting the EditorKit, the insertString method shifts the caret to the zero caret position, hence messing up the UI.p  pHeres an image of the functionality Im trying to achive.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commhqvk.png altWhat I wantbr This is what I want to my JTextPane to look like.brbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comk5zeE.png altMess brThis is what it currently looks likep  pHow do I use both setEditorKit and DefaultStyledDocument in my application p

Negative 1258 pIm using Susy as CSS grid framework and I find that 48 columns gives me alot more control over the design. Most of the time 24 or even 12 columns is more that enough, but for special cases 48 is a bit more convenient. p  pIve noticed that the web standard seems to be 12, with Bootstrap amp Foundation for example. Concerning those I understand that a larger grid would generate alot more css. But since Susy doesnt have that problem, is there another reason for limiting your columns to 12 To me it seems there isnt, but since most people are using 12 columns I cant shake the feeling that Im missing something.p
Negative 1258 pFor a school project Ive built a scanner and connected it to matlab. The scanner scans images 16by16 pixels of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Im using a principal component analysis in order to classify the scans. Due to the low accuracy of the scanner, I need to preprocess the scans first, before I can actually send them through the recognition machine.p  pOne of these preprocessingsteps is to thicken the lines. So far, Ive used a pretty simple averageing filter for this codeH  ones3, 3 . 9code. This bears the problem, that the circular gap of the digits 8 and 9 is likely to be closed. I enclose a picture of all my preprocessingsteps, where the problem is visible the image with the caption threshholded still shows the gap, but it disappeared after the thickening step.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comynO0y.png altenter image description herep  pMy question is Do you know a better filter for this thickeningstep, which would not erase the gap Or do you have an idea for a filter which could be applied after the thickening to produced the desired result Any other suggestions or hints are also greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1258 pIm creating a tab bar application for the iPhone and I want whatever view is currently active to be fully unloadedreleased if a new tab is selected. When any tab is reselected I want it to have to reload everything. The reason I seek this feature is because all views interact with a single database, and can modify the database. When the views are built they are built off the current database, which means that they can be out of date without a forced reload of the view.p  pTo see what Im referring to load the Phone app on your iPhone and you can type in a number on the keypad, switch tabs, switch back to the keypad and the number you typed remains there.

To fix it, the specialization of FindRootValueType must explicitly use codeboostoptionalltTgtcode, not the typedef that should be equivalent to it.  And this defeats the goal of only specifying the underlying implementation type in one place.p  pIs this a compiler bug or is this supposed to not work  Or am I just doing something wrong  Is there a better way to write it such that it works as expectedp  pI also tried reversing the logic thuslyp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt struct FindRootValueType      typedef T type    define Base here  templatelttypename Tgt struct FindRootValueTypeltBaseltTgtgt      typedef typename Troottype type    define A here  templatelttypename Tgt struct FindRootValueTypeltAltTgtgt      typedef T type    define B, C here no specialisation codepre  pBut this doesnt work either I think because specialisation doesnt follow base types, or possibly its just the order of definition.  I dont want to have to specialise for B, C etc specifically.p  pBTW, in both of the above, not working means that compiler errors were produced that indicated that it was using the base definition of codeFindRootValueTypecode, not the specialisation.p

Negative 1258 pIve used Google Analytics on several iOS apps. No problems. This time, problem. p  pI do the basic setup using version 3.0. Add libraryheader, include required frameworks, and stuff the boiler plate code into the codeAppDelegate.mcode. So far so good, everything works as expected. I take my first codeUIViewControllercode and change it to extend codeGAITrackedViewControllercode and it hits the fan. The app freezes up on the first screen and memory usage starts going up about 4Meg per second. So I change the codeUIViewControllercode back and all is good. I try making the screen name call manually in codeviewDidLoadcode. p  precode Analytics id tracker  [[GAI sharedInstance] defaultTracker] [tracker setkGAIScreenName valueInitial] [tracker send[[GAIDictionaryBuilder createAppView] build]] codepre  pSame thing happens. My view controller has a couple custom container views and it the root view controller on a generic codeUINavigationViewControllercode. I figure its probably the custom containers confusing it about which is the active view controller and what screen name to use but Im not seeing any sign of this in the logging.p  pHas anyone run into this problem and been able to nail down exactly whats causing it and how to work around it p

Negative 1258 pI have a custom class and I want it to be able to handle various parsing operations using codeAFXMLRequestOperationcode differently.p  pI would prefer for this one custom class to be its own delegate for both operations, meaning the parser delegate methods would need to be able to determine which operation they should be handling. Is that a standard practice And if so, how is it typically managed I could simply set a property on my class to A or B and check its value in the delegate methods, but Im wondering if theres a more elegant solution or if Im missing somethingmisconceptualizing the problem. p  pI know that codeNSURLConnectionDelegatecode methods get passed the initiating connection and can examine it but for codeNSXMLParserDelegatecode methods, I define an codeAFXMLRequestOperationcode, which does not get passed to the delegate methods rather, the NSXMLParser defined in the operations completion block gets passed to the delegate methods is there some way I can use that to pass identifying info to the delegate methods  p  pThank youp

Negative 1258 pIm searching for an algorythm from the classification trees algorythm familiy, that can provide a number more than 1 of predicitions in some ranked order per observation. To be more specific  I have 10 binary target models to predict a target variable with 10 levels. How can I combine the models in such way to fetch a predefine number of prediction with a confidence level. For instance, I want my combined model to fetch 2 predictions for each obeservation. Once possible approach is to take the 2 binary models with the highest accuracy for that specific observation and fetch them. How do I calculate the averaged accuracy of this set of 2 predictions  If anyone can provide literature and R code examples from rpart package, that would be more helpful. thanksp

Negative 1258 pIm trying to do a simple download of a file in php. Actually its a .csvfile, but it seems I cant even download a regular text file. I found the following code...p  precodemytext  some text headerContenttype textplain headerContentDisposition attachment filenamewhatever.txt echo mytext codepre  p...but when I add it to my php file, there is no download being initialized, but the text of mytext i.e. some text is just simply displayed within my HTML text. I am running the whole thing in wordpress, if that might be important. Any ideap  pEdit I tried the solution from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5595485phpfiledownloadphp, file downloada but this wasnt working at all for me. I guess, theres a problem with the headers. Since I use the php script inside my wordpress environment, I think he headers I set, are ignored  and thats why the file is interpreted as text instead as a downloadable file. Is there any way to ignore the wordpress header or force the custom header somehow p

So I excluded the parser from the building process.p  pIn the answer of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2486106yaccandlexinclusionconfusionYacc and Lex inclusion confusiona, Ive read that only the .h files have to be included, to use the functions of the parser. p  pstrongSo what I did isstrongp  ul liTo get access to the parser sources out of emmyem project, I created a simple function that just prints a line on the console in yconf.y and yconf.c codevoid testoutchar txt printftxtcodeli liI even created a yconf.h with the functionhead codevoid testoutchar txtcodeli licompiled the parser with my own makefileli lipthe main, where Id like to call the function looks likep  precodeinclude y.tab.h include yconf.h include ltstdio.hgt  extern C int mainint argc, char argv[]      char configIn[]  test     printfconfigIn      testoutconfigIn      return 0   codepreli ul  pstrongThe errorstrongp  pAnd now when compiling, an error appears codeundefined reference to testoutcharcode. But Eclipse itself can resolve the function  when clicking that function, the yconf.h opens. And thats why I dont know where exactly the problem is.p  pstrongEclipse Settingsstrongp  pIn projectpropertiesCC BuildSettings I put the same include paths to the parsersources for codegcccode and codegcode and the linker.

There is already a existing database that has these relationships, but it links parts one at a time I will provide a flowchart of this at the end, dont worry.

Negative 1258 pI was just wondering about this, and I havent found a good answer so far, so I thought Id just ask it here.p  pWhat Im wondering is, if its possible to detect browser loading actions. And just to be clear, Im not talking specificly AJAX request nor the initial loading of the page. p  pIm talking about everything the browser loads, so IFrames, jQuery loads, requests. I know that AJAX requests are detectable, but as for image loading, or IFrames not so much.p  pAnd Id like for this to be as dynamic as possible, ie. nothing added to the DOM structure whatsoever.p  pWell, thats it really, I thought that this would be an interesting thingy.

Negative 1258 pIn CoffeeScript, I like to use destructuring assignments when returning functions with multiple return values. It makes it clearer what is being returned, versus returning an array.p  pFor instance, returning an array from a function in JavaScriptp  precodefunction getSumAndDifffirstNumber, secondNumber    var sum  firstNumber  secondNumber   var difference  firstNumber  secondNumber    return [sum, difference]   var values  getSumAndDiff10, 5 var sum  values[0] var difference  values[1] codepre  pWhile in CoffeeScript, returning an object from a functionp  precodegetSumAndDiff  firstNumber, secondNumber gt   sum  firstNumber  secondNumber   difference  firstNumber  secondNumber    sum, difference  sum, difference  getSumAndDiff10, 5 codepre  pHowever, the problem is that the CoffeeScript method replaces any existing variables called codesumcode and codedifferencecode. So if I ran this function multiple times in succession, then they would keep overwriting the previous one.p  pThere are several ways of resolving this, of course, such as simply by assigning the returned variables to other names each time, like sop  precodesum, difference  getSumAndDiff10, 5 sum1  sum difference1  difference  sum, difference  getSumAndDiff11, 6 sum2  sum difference2  difference codepre  pBut is there a cleaner way of doing it Or, is perhaps the best solution to simply return an array when I need to run a function like this multiple times in a row Or would closures make sense, or is that too much excessive code Im just wondering if theres something Im perhaps missing, because I figure theres got to be a cleaner way of doing this, especially with CoffeeScript Or maybe my general approach to this is flawed, such as I should instead only have one return value per function instead, to simplify thingsp
Negative 1258 pThere have been a lot of people saying that Codeblock and GNU are the best compilers. I am a beginner at CC programming. Currently I am using Dev C, so does it make a difference to which compiler I use And I use Windows 8.1 as my OS, if that is a deciding factor.. Thanks for any help in advance p

Negative 1258 pIm using Highcharts.js to render a bunch of charts to some divs that are jqueryUI draggables. In Chrome, this works perfectly fine. However, in Internet Explorer tested in 11, but maybe in other versions too, there are some scaling issues.

All of the items are present, and you can still click on them for normal behavior. They are all just stuck on one line like that.p  pHas anyone encountered this issue beforehave any ideas to fix it I tried a whole bunch of options for the legend in the chart settings, but other than being able to move it around while still stuck on one line I cant affect it.p  pcode sample HTMLp  precodeltdiv iddropwrapgt ltdiv iddockgt     ltdiv iddockheadgtAvailable Cardsltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag1gt10 Year Historyltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag2 styletop180pxgtPremiumltbrgtPie Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag3 styletop230pxgtLossltbrgtPie Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag4 styletop280pxgtPremiumltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag5 styletop330pxgtLossltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag6 styletop380pxgtLoss RatioltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idexpandgt     ltdiv idhlpmsg styletextweight bold fontsize 150 position absolute top 350px left 500pxgtDrag cards here to expand themltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pJSp  precodefunction areachartgenchtype, item  console.logitem drag4.highcharts     chart          type area,         backgroundColor 57CF57,         borderColor 000,         borderRadius 10px,         marginBottom 150,         marginLeft 70,         marginTop 40     ,     legend          floating true,         itemStyle              lineHeight 20px         ,         maxHeight 150,         labelFormatter function               return this.name         ,         layout vertical     ,     title          text 10 Year   chtype   History     ,     subtitle                  text Source lta hrefhttpthebulletin.metapress.comcontentc4120650912x74k7fulltext.pdfgt                      thebulletin.metapress.comltagt             ,     xAxis          allowDecimals false,         labels              formatter function                   return this.value  clean, unformatted number for year                           ,     yAxis          title              text chtype         ,         labels              formatter function                   if chtype  Loss Ratio                      return this.value                    else                      return   this.value  1000  k                              ,             labels                  overflow justify                           ,     tooltip          pointFormat series.name point.y,         valueDecimals 2     ,     plotOptions          area              pointStart 1940,             marker                  enabled false,                 symbol circle,                 radius 2,                 states                      hover                          enabled true                                                   ,             stacking normal              ,     colors [         6FF299, 5A90D6, E39220, D17BC6, 8085e9,         f15c80, e4d354, 8085e8, 8d4653, 91e8e1],     series [         name Casualty,         data [             [2004, 360902.0],             [2005, 371489.0],             [2006, 398748.0],             [2007, 416682.0],             [2008, 413205.0],             [2009, 374988.0],             [2010, 400701.0],             [2011, 483902.0],             [2012, 447391.0],             [2013, 456503.0]         ]     ,          name Engineering,         data [             [2004, 0.0],             [2005, 0.0],             [2006, 0.0],             [2007, 0.0],             [2008, 0.0],             [2009, 0.0],             [2010, 0.0],             [2011, 0.0],             [2012, 0.0],             [2013, 0.0]         ]     ,          name Ocean Marine,         data [             [2004, 0.0],             [2005, 180000.0],             [2006, 234395.0],             [2007, 248322.0],             [2008, 262216.0],             [2009, 248754.0],             [2010, 274888.0],             [2011, 289781.0],             [2012, 340459.0],             [2013, 405247.0]         ]     ,          name Property,         data [             [2004, 285354.0],             [2005, 365038.0],             [2006, 395420.0],             [2007, 554621.0],             [2008, 685197.0],             [2009, 630535.0],             [2010, 613608.0],             [2011, 643399.0],             [2012, 704345.32],             [2013, 822684.93]         ]     ]  item.resize codepre  pp  pHere is a link to the fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdLL8cw7s5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdLL8cw7s5ap  pOddly, everything works perfectly fine in the fiddle, even in IE.

Negative 1258 pI have a Perl tied hash which uses the a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgpodSDBMFile relnofollowcodeSDBMFilecodea module and I need to do some character encoding conversions when storing or fetching values.p  pI followed the a hrefhttpsmetacpan.orgpoddistributionperlpodperldbmfilter.pod relnofollowdocumentation of codeperldbmfiltercodea and in general it seems to work I get the results from the hash properly encoded like expected, and it stores the byte values for my encoding in the file, which I check using a hex editor.p  pWhat is not working is any kind of iteration over all elements of the hash, either using codekeyscode, or codeeachcode, or things like codeDataDumpercode, or even a simple copy operation to another hash.p  pWhat I always get is an infinite recursion. It seems like the iterator never gets to its end, and if I use codeeachcode and print the iterated values they are repeated.p  pI hunted the problem down to the use of codefilterfetchkeycode and the charset conversion Im doing there. If I comment out codefilterfetchkeycode, or if I change the filter method to do just codereturn shiftcode, then the iteration works again. Either of these solves my problem, but I need to use codefilterfetchkeycode to send the caller properlyencoded strings.p  precodedbmgtfilterfetchkey  sub    selfgtnormalizeCharset   sub normalizeCharset    my self  shift  Carpcroak...    return shift   return ...windows2utfshift  codepre  pIf I uncomment codereturn shiftcode, the iteration works but commented like above it doesnt. I guess it has something to do what happens to codecode, but I have no idea, as codewindows2utfcode just copies the given data and does some character encoding. This works the same way for storing keys and values and even for fetching values. Only keys are the problem and only if I do an iteration, not if I directly ask for specific keys.p  pAny hints on what Im doing wrongp  pTheres a thread on a hrefhttpwww.perlmonks.orgnodeid1099905 relnofollowcodePerlmonkscodea as well.p

Negative 1258 pIm looking to create an application written in HTMLJS and wrapped within a Android App. The reason for this is that I need to access the devices components such as the microphone and storage but because of time restraints I do not have time to full learn Android development.

My thought was to write the application in HTMLJS and use a webview within the Android app, then record sounds from the microphone using Java and send them to the HMTLJS webview.p  pCan anyone tell me if this is possible and if so point me in the right direction of where to start. If not is there another way that I can do this p

Negative 1258 pHow bad is it to redefine special words technically predefined global variables like codeObjectcode in Node.js I have a codemongoosecode model I want to call Object because, well, it represents an object, and the convention for codemongoosecode seems to be that the models are uppercase. However, I noticed that codeObjectcode is a keyword in JavaScript. I tried to use Node itself to see exactly what the codeObjectcode keyword does, based on what the JavaScript source code says about it. However, when I run codeconsole.logObject.toStringcode in the Node shell, it returns codefunction Object  [native code] code. Other special words, like codeBooleancode and codeStringcode, produce similar output when logged. I would go into the Node source code, but I unfortunately have not had the privilege of learning C or C.p  pTherefore, strongwhat would the repercussions of redefining JavaScript keywords like codeObjectcode, codeArraycode, or codeNumbercodestrong I am mainly asking in the context of Node.js, but information about JavaScript in general would certainly be helpful. I will likely not use these variables as they were originally intended, which I believe is as a wrapper object for each type codeArraycode for arrays, codeNumbercode for numbers, etc., but would there be any other unintended consequences in using them for a completely different purposep

Negative 1258 pFrom what I have learned, there is a difference between a function and a procedure. I know that a function returns a value whereas a procedure just executes commands one after the other. Today on the other hand, my professor stated that we can also use a procedure to return a value in a C program. Im pretty sure that it is not possible. I also checked on the internet and read that a procedure just executes a command and a function executes and returns a value. I may be mistaken. If anyone can please tell me if I have the correct understanding , it would be a big help. Thank you p

In fact nothing in the codeAdmincode version of the controller would execute anymore.

Among my guesses is that the nonadmin codeSpreeProductsControllercode decorator is somehow being applied to the deeper version, however even if that is the case, I am unaware of any way that code.classevalcode would emremoveem or emnegateem functionality applied in another decorator. Alternatively, I may be doing something incredibly obvious, and I simply cannot see however as stated, I am currently at a loss to explain this behaviour.p  pstrongQuestionstrong p  pGiven the described scenario, what might cause the codebeforeactioncode in the codeAdmincode decorator to cease functioning when the nonadmin decorator is attempting to decorate a class of the same name in a different higher module  namespacep

I know the production DB handles a large volume of data in the specific table, if that matters at all.p

Negative 1258 pI used sqlite3 on my Mac to create a small database file surnamed .db containing one table, plus the androidmetadata table containing enUS.  I pasted the file into the assets folder of my Android Studio project.  At runtime, the onCreate method of my SQLiteOpenHelper copies the file into datadataprojectnamedatabasesfilename.db on my Genymotion emulator a Samsung Galaxy S5.  But when I try to read the table in filename.db with the Cursor provided by the getReadableDatabase method of the SQLiteOpenHelper, I get the LogCat error ESQLiteLog 1 no such table tablename.  The same thing happens on my elcheapo Azpen A727 Android tablet.p  pThe filename.db file copied into the datadataprojectnamedatabases folder on the emulator contains the same number of bytes 5120 as the original filename.db I created on my Mac with sqlite3.  When I compare the two .db files with the Unix octal dump command od c, I found that they are identical for the first 16 bytes, and differ for the first time at the 17th byte.  The original file has octal 004 as its seventeenth byte, and the copy has 020.  Should the two files have had identical contents  When I try to examine datadataprojectnamedatabasesfilename.db with sqlite3 .dump, I get ERROR 11 database disk image is malformed.p  pThe getReadableDatabase method of my SQLiteOpenHelper triggers a call to the onCreate method of the helper.  In onCreate, I copy filename.db from the assets folder to the datadataprojectnamedatabases directory.  At the end of onCreate, I verified that the 17th byte in both copies of filename.db is 004.p  pI added an onOpen method to my SQLiteOpenHelper.  It is called automatically by getReadableDatabase after onCreate, and does nothing except calling super.onOpen.  After calling super.onOpen, my onOpen prints the 17th byte of both copies of filename.db.  The byte in assets remains 004, but the byte in datadataprojectnamedatabases has become 020.  The damage also occurs if onOpen does not call super.onOpen.p  pWhat sinister force might be damaging datadataprojectnamedatabasesfilename.db between the end of the call to onCreate and the start of the call to onOpen  Or is the problem something else entirely  Thank you very much.p  precodepackage edu.nyu.scps.offer  import android.content.Context import android.content.res.AssetManager import android.database.Cursor import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper import android.util.Log  import java.io.FileInputStream import java.io.FileOutputStream import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStream import java.io.OutputStream  public class Helper extends SQLiteOpenHelper      private static final String DBNAME  offers.db     private Context context      public HelperContext context          supercontext, context.getDatabasePathDBNAME.getPath, null, 1         this.context  context           Override     public void onCreateSQLiteDatabase db          try              AssetManager assetManager  context.getAssets             InputStream inputStream  assetManager.openDBNAME in assets folder             OutputStream outputStream  new FileOutputStreamgetDatabaseName              byte[] buffer  new byte[1024]             int length              while length  inputStream.readbuffer gt 0                  outputStream.writebuffer, 0, length                           outputStream.flush             outputStream.close             inputStream.close          catch IOException exception              Log.emyTag, exception   exception                    Override     public void onUpgradeSQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion        codepre  pHere is a .dump of the file I created by hand using sqlite3p  precodesqlite3 offers.db .dump PRAGMA foreignkeysOFF BEGIN TRANSACTION CREATE TABLE androidmetadata          locale text default enUS  INSERT INTO androidmetadata VALUESenUS CREATE TABLE offers      id integer primary key autoincrement,     title text,     description text  INSERT INTO offers VALUES1,Prewar Castle,It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania.

DELETE FROM sqlitesequence INSERT INTO sqlitesequence VALUESoffers,10 COMMIT codepre  pApril 15, 2015 I discovered why my .db file was corrupted.  When the getReadableDatabase method of class SQLiteOpenHelper called onCreate, the .db file had already been created and was even in the middle of a database transaction.  The code in my onCreate overwrote this file completely.  At some later time the SQLiteOpenHelper attempted to complete the transaction, but the .db file with which it started the transaction has been destroyed.  Solution the .db file must be copied from the projects assets embeforeem getReadableDatabase is called.  The most straightforward approach would be to copy it in the constructor for my subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper.  But Androids documentation says that SQLiteOpenHelpers constructor must return very quickly and defer the creation of the .db file to getReadableDatabase.  So I ended up overriding getReadableDatabase with a new method that copies the .db file and then calls the getReadableDatabase of the superclass SQLiteOpenHelper.  super.getReadableDatabase will not attempt to create a new .db file if it finds the file already in existence.  Details omitted. I debugged my original code only because I was curious to know why it corrupted the .db file.  In real life Im going to use SQLiteAssetHelper, and I am grateful for the suggestion.p

There are more than 200 in the document in question.p  pTheres a bug in sheets a hrefhttpsproductforums.google.comforummydiscussionsdocsCkPhSy1jliQ relnofollowDocumented herea and since default ranges in Named Ranges have the entire span of merged cells ie codeA1J1code, but named ranges only work in formulas if you specify JUST the first cell, I thought I could save a lot of time by just accepting the default named range codeA1J1code as an example and then script it so I can just strip everything off of the end, leaving just codeA1code.  In order to do this, I need to simply be able to get a list of all named ranges in the sheet.p  pIs this possiblep

h2Update 2h2  pSince the answer to this question was posted, I was doing a bit of research and tried replicating the scenario on a different machine. I had setup a similar environment on a different machine and guess what, the same thing has happened again.p  pThen I tried running a custom script on the client side of my application so that a query is run every 15 minutes on the MySQL server. Doing so, I was able to stop the server from crashing. Now I really suspect that this IS a configuration issue. Do correct me if Im wrong.p  h2Update 3h2  pOn further investigation, I have tried to replicate the same stack trace by modifying the codewaittimeoutcode variable of MySQL to a very small value and I was successful but with a slight variation in the stacktrace.p  pIt is now a codeSoftware cause connection abort recv errorcode.p
Negative 1258 pIm currently investigating a crash that happened compiled with gcc 4.2.1 on arm7tdmi architecture I could use 4.9.3 on demand. Im using LPC2387 and Im getting wdog resets. Instead of wdog resets Im using wdog interrupts, so when it would reset otherwise, it gets into my handler, which saves state and prints a whole memory dumps 64k only. So basically I know the registers before wdog reset and have a stack showing all of the call history. p  pOn the stack I can see loads of references to the end of the function, and I see many instructions as data in the memory region. Which I think will become the reason for the halt and then the consequent wdog interrupt. Any ideas what might be happeningp  pI guess reasons can be when dereferencing a function pointer, but my function seems to be quite straight forward. It is touching many hardware registers interrupt, peripheral enabledisable. p  pLike thisp  p20150527 044530  addr 4000BF2C value7FE00390 this is  svcvc   0x00e00390 according to gcc 4.2.1 and  .word   0x7fe00390 according to 4.9.3.p  pAlso at the end of the function I see this in gcc 4.9.3p  precode   191d4       e89d6ff8        ldm     sp, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, sl, fp, sp, lr    191d8       e12fff1e        bx      lr    191dc       7fe00390        .word   0x7fe00390    191e0       40000044        .word   0x40000044    191e4       00064de5        .word   0x00064de5    191e8       00064dfb        .word   0x00064dfb    191ec       4000107c        .word   0x4000107c    191f0       e0028000        .word   0xe0028000    191f4       e01fc000        .word   0xe01fc000    191f8       40001084        .word   0x40001084    191fc       4000113c        .word   0x4000113c    19200       3800b010        .word   0x3800b010    19204       40002a78        .word   0x40002a78    19208       40002ab4        .word   0x40002ab4    1920c       40002aa0        .word   0x40002aa0    19210       40001080        .word   0x40001080    19214       400001a9        .word   0x400001a9    19218       e002c000        .word   0xe002c000    1921c       40001134        .word   0x40001134    19220       00064e0e        .word   0x00064e0e codepre  pIt used to look like this on gcc 4.2.1p  precode   1953c       7fe00390        svcvc   0x00e00390    19540       40000044        andmi   r0, r0, r4, asr 32    19544       0006d74c        andeq   sp, r6, ip, asr 14    19548       0006d764        andeq   sp, r6, r4, ror 14    1954c       400012d0        ldrmid  r1, [r0], r0    19550       e0028000        and     r8, r2, r0    19554       e01fc000        ands    ip, pc, r0    19558       40001390        mulmi   r0, r0, r3    1955c       40001394        mulmi   r0, r4, r3    19560       e002c040        and     ip, r2, r0, asr 32    19564       40002e54        andmi   r2, r0, r4, asr lr    19568       e002c068        and     ip, r2, r8, rrx    1956c       e002c000        and     ip, r2, r0    19570       40002e90        mulmi   r0, r0, lr    19574       e002c02c        and     ip, r2, ip, lsr 32    19578       3fffc000        svccc   0x00ffc000    1957c       40002e7c        andmi   r2, r0, ip, ror lr    19580       3fffc0a0        svccc   0x00ffc0a0    19584       400012d4        ldrmid  r1, [r0], r4    19588       400001a1        andmi   r0, r0, r1, lsr 3    1958c       400012d8        ldrmid  r1, [r0], r8    19590       0006d778        andeq   sp, r6, r8, ror r7 codepre  pCan someone explain me what is in the end of the function what are the .word regions Why would I see pointers to this area on the stackp  pThanks, Peterp

Negative 1258 pNOTE This is for a homework assignment, but the portion I have a question on is ok to ask help for.p  pI have to script out a sequence 11110000111000110010 i am using python without using switches or if statements and only a maximum of 5 for and whiles.p  pI already have my script laid out to iterate, I just cant figure out the algorithm as recursive or explicit let alone whether the elements are 1s 2s or 4s p  pAs much as we have learned so far there is no equation or algorithm to use to figure OUT the algorithm for sequence. Just a set of instructions for defining one once we figure it out. Does anyone see a pattern here I am missingp  pEDIT What I am looking for is the algorithm to determine the sequence. IE the sequence 1,3,6,10,15 would come out to be a[n]a[n1]n where n is the index of the sequence. This would be a recursive sequence because it relies on a previous elements value or index. In this case a[n1] refers to the previous indexs value. Another sequence would be 2, 4, 6, 8 would come out to be a[n]  n2 which is an explicit sequence because you only require the current index or value.p  pEDIT Figured it out thanks to all the helpful people that replied.... I cant believe I didnt see it p

Negative 1258 pHi i am making a game with UIKit. I have been set as my codeViewControllercode should be controlled by codeGameControllercode class and after each  successfull game10 games for to finish one level Gamecontroller will send a delegate call to  ViewController to know and  codeViewControllercode will update gamenumber and level number and it will call codeGameControllercode to move to next game. After finishing the level the ViewController will inform to the user by showing a Trophy and if he presses the Okay button on that view the dissapper and game will proceed to next level. This is the brief introduction of my game. Now come to my question, to present Trophy i have used UIPresentationController to present  which is having a Trophy and button my plan is when user pressed  Okay  button it should send protocol call to codeViewControllercode to dismiss that PresentedView and also should call codeGameControllercode  method to proceed to next level but it seems this protocol method is not working.

Negative 1258 pI am well aware that the term Floating is probably not valid but it was the only word that came to mind to describe what I am trying to do. p  pSo,I am trying to develop a widgetlike application that calculates remaining Megabytes for 3G. The thing is that I want easy access to it and would like to have it remain always on top. While I have been able to handle most of it I am having a hard time implementing the following idea. p  pI want the application to always keep a small icon on screen,which will display a number,the amount of remaining Megabytes. The idea is that this icon will be small and will always remain on screen and at the same time I will be able to use the other applications in the background. p  pAn example of a similar application would be the facebook messenger app which remains almost always on screen without interfering with the other apps the user might run at the same time.p  pI have looked over several websites and I could not find any idea on how to make something like that,so I am turning to you for assistance.p

It works up to this point.p  pNow, the issue is when i repeat the same thing i.e. click on another  element, go to another page, and append that item to Page1, i cant get the previous appended items on those elements.p  pSo, i thought of using localStorage to save the jquery objects, then use that localStorage to retrieve back those selected items with every refresh after coming from another page.p  precodeltformgt   ltdiv classitems idagtAltdivgt   ltdiv classitems idbgtBltdivgt   ltdiv classitems idcgtCltdivgt ltformgt   return querystring parameter function GetURLParametersParam          var fullQueryString  window.location.search.substring1         var sURLVariables  fullQueryString.splitamp         for var i  0 i lt sURLVariables.length i              var sParameterName  sURLVariables[i].split         if sParameterName[0]  sParam                      return sParameterName[1]                           function    arrImg  []       var clickId   function that returns the div element that is selected   var id  GetURLParameterid    if id  item1          var img1  ltimg iditem1 src gt           clickId.appendimg1         var obj    clickId.html         arrImg.pushobj              else if id  item2          var img2  ltimg iditem2 src gt           clickId.appendimg2         var obj    clickId.html         arrImg.pushobj               else if id  item3          var img3  ltimg iditem3 src gt              clickId.appendimg3         var obj    clickId.html         arrImg.pushobj            localStorage.setItemImgCookie, JSON.stringifyarrImg  codepre  pI get ImgCookie Item1  only.

Negative 1258 pI recently came across quite a useful load balancingreverse proxy tool called Nginx. I know that it equally sends out the incoming requests to my four servers, and that is great, but it gives me a different issue.p  pSuppose I was running a blog of some sort, and a new user created his account and was redirected by Nginx to go to one of servers, lets say Server 1 of 4. Now hes working. He sets up his page, posts a couple posts about cats, and now hes ready to pack it in for the night, and he logs out.p  pThe next morning he logs back in, but this time Nginx redirects him to Server 2 of 4. He goes to his blog page, but nothing is there because all of the .html files were stored on Server 1 of 4.p  pBasically, my question is how is one of the servers on the network supposed to access, or even know, where a file is on another serverp  pRight now, I have a couple of ideas. Ill list them below, and you guys tell me if they are even possible.p  ol lipHave one central server for storing all files. This server doesnt take any requests. It just provides all of the .html, .css, and .js files for the server that needs them. I still dont know how to access these files thoughpli lipSynchronize all files on all servers. When one file updates, all of the duplicate files update. This seems like kind of a waste of server space, thoughpli ol  pOnce again, Im sorry if this is a really dumb question. Im not too experienced in these things. Im using Ubuntu Linux Server edition by the way. Thanks guys.p

Negative 1258 pI am trying to develop a simple comment system.p  pFor every new post, a new list item gets created.p  pThe id of the listitem is AUTOINCREMENT. The popup should insert the values id of the post id, the author of the post autor and the author of the comment usernamep  pNow the problem is that if I set the id of the element listone to the id of the row row[id] the id is right. But when I set the id of a listitem to the value of the input element id, the id or something else that I add there have always the same id or time like the last added postlist item.p  pThe second input element which should insert the autor of the post works fine.

Negative 1258 pI have a case where I have 2 edittext email and password. When any one gets focus say email the hint moves up and becomes the heading. In this animation i translate the textviewhint up and at the same time scale it down to 0.8f.  At the same time the second textview say password looses focus, if its still empty i want to reverse the animation and put back the heading as hint. To sum up hint moves up as heading and gets back to hint position if the edittext remains empty. I have two different animation set for both the editText views, they work well individually but on parallel execution one of them doesnt show up instead the hint becomes invisible. p  pMy code is as follows p  precodeemail.setOnFocusChangeListenernew View.OnFocusChangeListener          Override         public void onFocusChangeView view, boolean b                 ifb ampamp emailAnimatedfalse                 Log.demail1, called                  AnimationSet animSet  new AnimationSettrue                 animSet.setFillAftertrue                 animSet.setFillEnabledtrue                 animSet.setDuration800                 TranslateAnimation translate  new TranslateAnimation0, 0, 0, 60                 animSet.addAnimationtranslate                 ScaleAnimation scale  new ScaleAnimation1f, 0.8f, 1f, 0.8f                 animSet.addAnimationscale                 emailText.startAnimationanimSet                 emailAnimatedtrue             else ifemailAnimatedtrue                              Log.demail2, called                  AnimationSet animSet  new AnimationSettrue                 animSet.setFillAftertrue                 animSet.setFillEnabledtrue                 animSet.setDuration800                 TranslateAnimation translate  new TranslateAnimation0, 0, 0, 60                 animSet.addAnimationtranslate                 ScaleAnimation scale  new ScaleAnimation1f, 0.8f, 1f, 0.8f                 animSet.addAnimationscale                 Reverse the animation if losses focus                  animSet.setInterpolatornew ReverseInterpolator                 emailText.startAnimationanimSet                 emailAnimatedfalse                                  password.setOnFocusChangeListenernew View.OnFocusChangeListener          Override         public void onFocusChangeView view, boolean b               ifb ampamp passwordAnimatedfalse                 Log.dpass1, called                  AnimationSet animSet  new AnimationSettrue                 animSet.setFillAftertrue                 animSet.setFillEnabledtrue                 animSet.setDuration800                 TranslateAnimation translate  new TranslateAnimation0, 0, 0, 60                 animSet.addAnimationtranslate                 ScaleAnimation scale  new ScaleAnimation1f, 0.8f, 1f, 0.8f                 animSet.addAnimationscale                  passwordText.startAnimationanimSet                 passwordAnimatedtrue                          else ifpasswordAnimatedtrue                              Log.dpass2, called                  AnimationSet animSet  new AnimationSettrue                 animSet.setFillAftertrue                 animSet.setFillEnabledtrue                 animSet.setDuration800                 TranslateAnimation translate  new TranslateAnimation0, 0, 0, 60                 animSet.addAnimationtranslate                 ScaleAnimation scale  new ScaleAnimation1f, 0.8f, 1f, 0.8f                 animSet.addAnimationscale                 animSet.setInterpolatornew ReverseInterpolator                  passwordText.startAnimationanimSet                 passwordAnimatedfalse                                codepre  pJust to make it more understandable, else if condition of email will be called whenever if condition of password is true and vies versa and thats how 2 animation sets are called.p

Negative 1258 pIm trying to export my report in CSV.  However, when it exports, it doesnt actually export the header row but instead uses the textboxs name from my table.  I would just rename all the textboxes but it is required that some of my headers contain spaces and a few have parenthesis which cannot be in an object name.  Is there a way to export in CSV that will give me my actual header row instead of the textbox namesp
