I have a codenumberfieldcode as followp  precode       xtype numberfield,       name rent,       minWidth 150,       allowBlank true,     keyNavEnabled true,     mouseWheelEnabled true,     hideTrigger true,  codepre  pThe number that users must enter is a big number like code20000000code.

Positive 4025 pI have a store and i had a model attached to it, but i notice that either if my model is wrong doesnt match json or I remove my model completely from the store, it still works.p  pI would like to know what advantages  disadvantages this offersp  pWhy include models when they can be removed. I must admit i never saw any documentation stating the model can be excluded, but it seems to work.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp
Positive 4025 pIm pretty new Ext JS and trying to embed a a hrefhttpsdocs.sencha.comextjs6.06.0.0classicapiExt.ux.form.MultiSelect relnofollowMultiSelecta inside a a hrefhttpsdocs.sencha.comextjs6.06.0.0classicapiExt.panel.Panel relnofollowPanela.p  pThe codeViewModelcode has a codestorescode property as you can see herep  precodeExt.defineTEST.view.controls.search.SearchFilterModel,      extend Ext.app.ViewModel,     alias viewmodel.filter,     data        title      ,     stores        test            fields [ id, name ],           proxy                type ajax,               url apitest,               reader array           ,           autoLoad true              codepre  pI would like to bind that in my codeViewcode like thisp  precodeviewModel    type filter ,   layout fit, border 1, plain true, scrollable y, layout fit,   bind    title title, ,   items    xtype multiselect,   scrollable false,   allowBlank true,   ddReorder true,   bind      store test   ,   valueField id,   displayField name  codepre  pIn this case, the codestorecode ends up as codenullcode though and no data is loaded into the widget. Instead of binding the store though, if I just hardcode it in the View, then it works. p  pAnyone see what the issue isp
Positive 4025 pMost of the time I create a project I miss a lot of necessary files such as the bootstrap and Json files.p  pI have all the dependencies Ruby, JDK, Apache Ant and Sencha CMD 5.1 6 gives me alot of problems, I have also set my custom Cmd Base Path to cmd5.1.3.61p  pIts a lot like a hit in miss, ill create and save a lot of projects in different places hoping that 1 will provide me with all the necessary files needed to code properly had to create over 10 projects for me to get a project folder with all the files in, and save them all in different directories.p  pAnyone know the cause of this or how to fix it so that Sencha Architect will give me all the necessary files with each project I createp  pIve tried Saving As the project folder to a different location, using sencha cmd web start, saving the entire project and its not letting me build the project as it is greyed outp  pAlso tried reinstalling sencha architect, cmd, and all its dependencies problem still occuring.p
Positive 4025 pIm on the latest Sencha CMD build of 5.1, and Architect 3.2. Whenever I build my application in Architect in Testing mode it worked fine, but would fail in Production mode. I searched all over the forums and Google trying every fix I could find, but it ended up just making more problems. Currently I cannot build in Testing or Production mode and I get the error below in both situations. Any great ideas on what could be happening or wherewhat to look forp  precode            Exception in thread Thread35 com.sencha.exceptions.BasicException The following error occurred while executing

Positive 4025 pIm using ExtJs 4.2 and my program currently suffers from a memory leak because over time it keeps a reference to a particular object inside the Ext.ComponentManager. I believe this is the only place that these constructors are being kept, but Im not 100 sure how to go about proving this my code base is very, very large.p  pBy using the garbage collection button in Chrome Development Tools it will actually clean up some of the constructors, but a vast proportion of them remain.

Positive 4025 pI have an object wich caches windows with all their internal structure form, other ui elements. So when a user opens a window which has already been cached, it does create it from scratch, but takes if from cache and just show it like thisp  precodewinCache[idgroup].show codepre  pSo, for each codeidgroupcode, there is a codewindowcode which may be cached in codewinCachecode. The problem is that I want to reset a codeformcode, which is inside the codewindowcode, and populate it with new data from database. I try to do it like thisp  precodeifwinCache[idgroup]     winCache[idgroup].removeListenershow     winCache[idgroup].addListenershow, function         populateformthis, idfield  lt this method retreives data from database      and sets the form            winCache[idgroup].show    else   window was not cached and has to be created from scratch   var win  ...   win.show    ... some BIG procedure   winCache[idgroup]  win  next time it will be taken from cache  codepre  pBut the problem is, for some insane reason, codeExtJScode duplicates codeshowcode listeners infinitely. So, for example, if I open codewinCache[10]code seven times for the same codeidgroupcode  code10code, but for different codeidfieldcodes idfield  1, idfield  2, ..., idfield  7, then codeshowcode listener will be triggered seven times  for each idfield. And that is incredible stupidity. So, my question is why codeExtJScode duplicates listeners And why doesnt coderemoveListenercode workp

Negative 4025 pI need to understand how NSView autoresizes its views. Ive set everything up in IB and my subviews resize nicely when I resize my window around with a mouse. However, if I do code[myMainView setFrame]code with my new frame rect, nothing happens. All of my subviews are still the original size even though the main view has the correct dimensions.  Childs coderesizeWithOldSuperviewSizecode gets called, but its still not appropriately sized.p  pI have a screenfull of cocoa elements on screen screen 1, label, image, video. Theres a welldefined layout for these elements. Ive setup autoresizing behavior via Interface Builder that works very well. Resizing the main window resizes the elements in a satisfying manner. p  pNow, the  user clicks the next button, whereupon a second screenfull of elements screen 2 is to be drawn. My layouts are built based on a canonical screensize say, 800x600. But now the window is larger or smaller because it was resized in screen 1. So the elements are now only taking a small area in the window, instead of being appropriately sized to fill the available space. I want to scale these elements.p  pAm I misunderstanding how autoresizing works How can I trigger the autoresize machinery underneath NSView manuallyp  pThere are two things I can dop  ol liManually resize the elements based on the current screen size relative to original size. This option is not my favorite because seemingly, Im forced to rewrite the code thats already working in NSView the autoresizing behaviorli liMy second option is to invoke the aforementioned NSViews autoresizing magic. Documentation implies that [NSView setFrame] will do that for me. What Ive tried was, resize my content view to the original screensize 800x600, render my elements and then resize it to the current window size. Conceptually, is it not identical to manually resizing the window It appears not to be. Again, this option is preferable because it minimizes the amount of code that has te be written and maintained.li ol

Negative 4025 pI manage a system for academic software projects which, as well as other things, allows projects to provide web pages integrated with an instance of the Trac bug tracker  wiki  source browser.

Sorry if you were expecting a carriagereturn question p  pFor several years this system has worked fairly nicely with the wrapping implemented by a userdefined Apache 2 OutputFilter for texthtml as the HTML stream leaves the server, I parse the input HTML into a DOM, normalize the tree a bit if needed, and then insert the appropriate extra elements. A bit scrappy, but the best way I could find, and so far its worked well. However, Im now wanting to upgrade the Trac system to 0.11, in which some neat AJAX is used to lazily render directory trees without reloading the effect is that the AJAX HTML stream emalsoem gets modified by the Apache filter, so that there are new top bars and nav furniture added each time I open a directory. This is obviously pretty sucky, and Id rather that my users could also use AJAX if they want, rather than hack in a Tracspecific ignore the dir browsing HTTP requests system.p  pWhat I want to know is whether anyone has a better way to apply such postprocessing to web pages... particularly ways that will intrinsically play a bit nicer with AJAX, without restricting my users freedom to do what they want with their pages. Thanksp
Negative 4025 pIm preparing to write a COLLADA importer in Java. There arent any prewritten importers, and even if there were I would probably be picky, so I believe this is best. I am going with COLLADA 1.4 because I do not need the 1.5 features, and many programs dont yet support it. I found the a hrefhttpwww.khronos.orgfilescollada5Fspec5F15F4.pdfspeca for it and plan on following it, but it is much easier to follow by example and reference the spec for additional information.p  pSo with all that... Can some of you who are experienced in COLLADA point me to some simple models that I can use to learn and test my importer as I write it I will export a few with just geometry, but I need some with textures or materials, with skeletal and keyframe animation, etc. Any suggestionsp  pAlternatively, I know that Blender can export COLLADA 1.4 and it can import most formats. If you have a really good suggestion for a site that has simple 3D models in another format that I will just import and export as COLLADA, that would be fine toop  pThanksp

I know how to insert the whole list into a single column but not how to insert just the elements of the list into separate columns or, in this example, rows.

Negative 4025 pWe are using ADO to access Oracle 10g release 2, Oledb provider for Oracle 10g. We are facing some issue with the connection pooling. The database reside on the remote machine and connection pooling is occuring as it should. But if the remote machine goes down for some reason, the connection is returned from the pool and query on that connection fails. When this connection is closed, it is returned back to the pool instead of being invalid. The subsequent connection opening requests are sucessfull but query fails. This is strange behaviour, according to OLEDB specifications, provider must support DBPROPCONNECTIONSTATUS property, thus in case of invalid connection, it would not be returned back to the pool.p  pThings get weired when the remote machine comes up. The connections in the pool are still invalid and although the connection opening succeeds, query on the connection fails. Oracle OLEDB is unable to connect to the server anymore and we have to restart our application. Well this is undesired cause our application is a critical application.p  pAny ideas on how to get over this.p  pThanks Mubashirp

Theres a table with two columns. The codeltthgtcode and codelttdgtcode elements of one column the second one are all given the class junk.p  pIn the good page, when you load it youll see a checkbox unchecked at the top. If you check the checkbox, the second column should disappear. If you uncheck it, the second column comes back. In the bad page, the checkbox starts out checked. Unchecking it has no effect in IE7, though it works in other browsers that are not possessed by fundamental evil.p  pThe checkbox is hooked to a little Javascript routine that just adds or removes the class compact from the codelttablegtcode tag.  Theres a stylesheet that includes thisp  precodetable.compact th.junk, table.compact td.junk    display none  codepre  pThus what strongshouldstrong happen is what happens on the good page.  However, it appears that in IE7 maybe 6 too if table elements emstart outem such that when eminitiallyem rendered theyre styled to be invisible, theyll never be seen, regardless of subsequent changes to the DOM that would bring new style rules into effect and leave them visible. This appears be an issue with codelttablegtcode parts in particular Im using the same mechanism elsewhere with other elements and they all work fine.p  pSo, the question is does anybody know of some hack mdash however revolting mdash that can be used to get around this idiotic behavior Obviously I could try and arrange for IE7 to start its views with the relevant toggle control set so that the table cells are visible, but in my case this happens around a table thats produced as an AJAX response, and so itd be a big mess Id rather avoid. The table is really a table, too its a display of tabular information, not a layout hack.p  pIve googled around and not found anything, which shouldnt be surprising if you consider how many hits you get from IE7 layout bug searches.p

Negative 4025 pemstrongSample code is at the end of the post for reference.emstrongp  pSorry for being so long winded, just trying to be through and leave no possible relevant info out.p  pThis seems like I painted myself in a bit of a corner.  I have a show hide toggle function that seems to work fine.  I have a small army of DIVs that are each shown and hidden when menu items are clicked.  This is a video gallery.  The buttons are in a JQuery scripted slider and are in an html list. CSS is used with Div IDs p  pThe function and hiding all work great.  This seems to be a strategy question since if I want the appropriate video to start playing when the div is shown, I remove preloadnone when I load this page, ALL 32 videos appear top be buffering and it KILLS page loading times.  When I have preloading set to none, the video sits there ready to be played after somebody clicks the appropriate button to show it.  I and my clients expect to see the movie start to play once the window displays.  As a matter of fact, once the window comes up and the video says loading, all I have to do is hit play and it starts playing smoothly.  So, without using autoplay, is there a way to get the video to play when the button is pressed to unhide the appropriate divp  pBTW I am using Video for Everyone as a base but it doesnt seem to offer a solution for more than a couple of videos.p  pPerhaps my video format is wrong but I am using h264 video saved out of quicktime pro in a .m4v extension.

Negative 4025 pFollowing the example at a hrefhttparticle.gmane.orggmane.comp.python.general541418 relnofollowhttparticle.gmane.orggmane.comp.python.general541418a, Ive succeeded in creating a callable class for balloon tooltips, but the greater complexities of that code elude me when it comes to customization. I browsed a bit of how it works through msdn, but being a novice at more windowsesque languagues like c and vb, etc. I was unable to make much sense of it. p  pSo I ask ye snakely academicsp  pThings Id like to be able to do with that code aside from the standard icon, title, textp  ul liPerform actions based on clicking the tooltipli liModify the tooltip that pops up over the icon in the system tray after loading it to reflect changing valuesli liMultiple lines Not sure if this can even be done, reallyli liMore information on other things you could do in a windows 7 environment versus XP which seems to be what this was written for.li ul  pIdeally Id get some sort of return value or some semblance of an event when the tooltip is clicked so that I could run some code, but currently Im importing that code as a module and calling at various times, so Im not sure how to handle clicks outside of the popup code itself...p  pInformation on handling these things with python seems quite scarce.

Negative 4025 pI dont understand how JS can run on the server.  Meaning you get back an HttpWebResponse in one of your class wrappers and now you want to parse it.  We know there are parser libraries out there such as Json.NET, ect.  And all of them use some sort of JavaScriptSerializer method that theyve coded.  But I just dont get how IIS is going to invoke JS serverside for purposes such as this..parsing JSON.p  pI mean its easy using jQuery.  So basically could you take that jQuery code and somehow run it serverside to parse your JSON in a method in one of your concrete classesp  pI just dont get this Javascript based serialization serverside when JavaScript runs in the browser and is clientside.p

Negative 4025 pEssentially I have an Excel file that is going to need to be worked on concurrently for a prolonged period of time.

Negative 4025 pI am using Informix for a OR database and Spring  Hibernate on the backend of my application.

In this query string Im using type casting for some columns something like this code..ROWstreet,city,countryaddressT..code where addressT is the type I made in the database.p  pThe problem here lays in Hibernates codecreateSQLQueryString querycode method.

Negative 4025 pIm creating a site where the main content is changed by Ajax calls, and I want to add Google Analytics code using the async gaq method. I understand I need to push a trackPageview event with the URI to gaq. There are 2 ways I can go about doing thisp  p1 Use an onclick property or bind events with JQuery on my links and forms, eg onlinkgaq.push....p  p2 Since my ajax code can process scripts when receiving the data from the ajax request, I can add the gaq.push... call in such a script snippet when providing the ajaxed page.p  pUsing the first option, yields a cleaner and more concise code I guess. However, the drawbacks is that I have to remember to put in ALL links and forms the analytics code, and if I use it on a form with JS validation, the click gets analyzed by GA even if the validation fails.p  pThe second option seems less clean, but solves the above issues. I can have one GA code which just checks if we are serving ajax or normal pages and output a JS snippet accordingly. Also, form submission get logged only when a form is really submitted.p  pI would appreciate any thoughts or comments on this. Perhaps there are more considerations, or ways to do thisp  pThanks Yaronp

Negative 4025 pI have a producer  consumer queue, except that there are specific types of objects. So not just any consumer can consume an added object. I dont want to make a specific queue for each type, as there are too many.

Negative 4025 pI have been using Spring Security 3.x for handling user authentication for my projects, and so far, it has worked flawlessly.p  pI recently received the requirements for a new project. In this project, it requires 2 sets of user authentication one to authenticate employees against LDAP, and another to authenticate customer against database. Im a little stumped on how to configure that in Spring Security.p  pMy initial idea was to create a login screen that has the following fieldsp  ul liradio button field  for users to choose whether they are employees or customers.li licodejusernamecode user field.li licodejpasswordcode password field.li ul  pIf the user selects employee, then I want Spring Security to authenticate them against LDAP, otherwise the credential will be authenticated against database. However, the problem is the form will be submitted to codejspringsecuritycheckcode and theres no way for me to send the radio button field to my implemented custom authentication provider. My initial thought is I probably need two form submission URLs rather than relying on the default codejspringsecuritycheckcode. Each URL will be handled by different authentication providers, but Im not sure how to configure that in Spring Security.p  pI know in Spring Security, I can configure fall back authentication, for example if LDAP authentication fails, then it will fall back to database authentication, but this is not what Im shooting for in this new project. p  pCan someone share how exactly I should configure this in Spring Security 3.xp  pThank you.p  hr  pstrongUPDATE  01282011  EasyAngels techniquestrongp  pIm trying to do the followingp  ul liEmployee form login submits to codejspringsecuritycheckforemployeecodeli liCustomer form login submits to codejspringsecuritycheckforcustomercodeli ul  pThe reason I want 2 different form logins is to allow me to handle the authentication differently based on the user, instead of doing a fallback authentication.

The problem Im currently facing is neither filter processes URLS seem registered in Spring Security because I keep getting codeError 404 SRVE0190E File not found jspringsecuritycheckforemployeecode.

These providers will then override the codesupportscodep  pstrongCustomerCustomAuthenticationProvider classstrongp  precodeOverride public boolean supportsClasslt extends Objectgt authentication      return CustomerUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class.isAssignableFromauthentication  codepre  pstrongEmployeeCustomAuthenticationProvider classstrongp  precodeOverride public boolean supportsClasslt extends Objectgt authentication      return EmployeeUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class.isAssignableFromauthentication  codepre  pstrongMyAuthenticationFilter classstrongp  precodepublic Authentication attemptAuthenticationHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws AuthenticationException       ...

Negative 4025 pI am not very experienced with VB.NET but I have to build an application using it in order to communicate with some software.  Basically, I need to be able to call this exe and have it run to perform some tasks, then close itself down.

So, the whole thing works great the tasks are even performed except the Me.Close causes a message to come up saying the application has stopped working. Any ideas why this is happening  Is it because Im trying to close it while its loading itself Any suggestions on how to achieve this in a different way I am forced to perform these tasks in VB, so please dont just say I should not be using VB.NET for this.  I know I shouldnt be but I have to. Ok, thanks a lot in advance.p

Negative 4025 pWe have an issue with the HTML produced from the Oracle BI publishing engine, in that the pages are not rendering properly in IE6. The issue is that of tables having their row heights hard coded, meaning that cells with multiple lines of text in them only display the first line, despite the fact that all data is present in the HTML source.p  pTo clarify, all pages look fine when viewed in IE7 or above, and Firefox. The upgrade to IE8 is on its way thank god, but not for another 6 months or so, so we need to find a temporary fix if possible.p  pFirstly, does anybody know if it is possible to enable some kind of IE6 compatibility mode on Oracle BI publisher through the Java APIS a long shot really I know.p  pSecondly, the transformation produced by the Oracle BI templates is an XLSFO style sheet. Our plan B here is to manually edit this file to produce the desired output. I would assume it should be possible in here to try and set the heights of rows to be auto decided or just not fixed, but so far to no avail, with the default just one row being displayed again.p  pDoes anyone have any experience  advice with either Oracle BI and IE6, or tables in XSLFO with cell heights expanding to match content in IE6p  pAny help  advice is very appreciated p

Negative 4025 pOk, this problem is really getting under my skin. Let me start out by describing my app in a step by step format.p  pFirst I have my Entity Framework generated model. Within it I have the following entitiesp  pimg srchttpwww.codetunnel.comEFEntities.jpg p  pNow, to implement validation on an entity, I use partial classes and handle the OnChanging hooks that EF provides. Here is a sample of the codePostCommentcode partial classp  precodenamespace CodeTunnel.Domain.Models      public partial class PostComment  IDataErrorInfo              private Dictionaryltstring, stringgt errors  new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt          partial void OnAuthorChangingstring value                      Validating anything but required value works fine.             Like this pseudovalidator.             if value.ToLower  fred                 errors.AddAuthor, Sorry, your name must be Fred.                   partial void OnBodyChangingstring value                      Required value validation does not work, I will tell you why below.             if string.IsNullOrEmptyvalue                 errors.AddBody, Body is required.                   region  IDataErrorInfo methods           public string Error                      get  return string.Empty                    public string this[string columnName]                      get                              if errors.ContainsKeycolumnName                     return errors[columnName]                 return string.Empty                                endregion       codepre  pNotice that my class inherits from codeIDataErrorInfocode. MVC checks this for validation errors by default. If it finds any then it invalidates the model and uses the stored errors as the messages for the validation helpers in the view. Im pretty sure when EF throws an exception, this dictionary never even gets populated with a value for that property. In fact, Im not even sure that MVC goes so far as to look for a value after detecting and invalidating the model upon the EF generated exception.p  pHere is a screen shot of the problem, including the sample pseudovalidator so you can see it is workingp  pimg srchttpwww.codetunnel.comValidationError.jpg p  pAs you can see, the error message didnt show up. However, it did correctly validate the field as invalid. If I put a value in there then it validates just fine. Ive done A LOT of research on this issue and here is what I knowp  pThe reason you cannot customize the error message that is displayed for required fields is because the model property is not nullable. Because it is not nullable, trying to bind a null value to it throws an exception. MVC swallows this excepion and invalidates the model as it should. The message is generated wherever this exception occurs. I dont know if the message is generated by EF or MVC Im guessing MVC since it was responsible for swallowing the exception in the first place. I dont know how to customize this message. As you can see it always says The value  is invalid. which I suppose isnt totally horrible but its really not very userfriendly.p  pIt gets to my name validator and checks if your name is fred just fine because no exception is thrown. As far as EF is concerned the value passed in is fine. It isnt until it gets to my codeOnAuthorChangingcode method that it realizes its not okay. This is the correct behavior and works just fine.p  pIf I throw an exception in my OnChanging events instead of adding to my codeIDataErrorInfocode dictionary I can generate the same validation message, only it puts the entered value between the single quotes. Examplep  precode    partial void OnAuthorChangingstring value              if value.ToLower  fred             errors.AddAuthor, Sorry, your name must be Fred.             throw new ExceptionSorry, your name must be Fred.      codepre  pThat code shows this message when test is entered as the value for Author The value test is invalid.. With the required fields its just that the value is null so there is nothing to put between the single quotes.p  pSeveral people a hrefhttptomasmcguinness.blogspot.com201002goawayvalueisinvalid.html relnofollowlike this guya suggest that you simply set the property to nullable in your model. This is NOT an acceptable solution. One reason why not is thisp  blockquote   pError 3031 Problem in mapping   fragments starting at line   313Nonnullable column   PostComments.Body in table   PostComments is mapped to a nullable   entity property.p blockquote  pAlso, setting nullable simply will not work on nonnullable types such as int, and switching int to a nullable int is a yucky mess that I wont even get into here.p  pThe bottom line is, I want to handle those exceptions from EF myself or at the very least customize the message it generates but I dont know how. Im completely lost. All I want to do is customize a message on what I thought was very simple model validationp  pAny help is much appreciated.p

Negative 4025 pGreetings all,p  pI have researched and found a number of discussions on designing a MVC service layer, but I havent found an answer to my exact questions. The post on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4164636servicelayerinterdependencyservice layer interdependencya has an image illustrating what I have in mind, but I have a further question that I dont believe is covered in the referenced post.p  pMy application will track data for a nonprofit that interacts with humans in multiple contexts. Maybe the human was a client, maybe they were an adviser, or maybe they were an adversary. They can be multiple. A client may later become an adversary think lawyers clients.p  pMy idea is that the creation of a new client or a new adversary always creates two records 1 record in the person table and one record in the ancillary table. My thoughts behind this is that there will be one place the person table to check to see if the business has had any past interaction with a given person. p  pMy question is , when representing entities in a 1 to 0..1 relationship to the controller layer, strong1 Should the controller be involved in combining and splitting classes before passing them to a view 2 If not, should the service layer construct the viewmodelstrong p  pIve read the post about the 1800 line Controller a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5193368keepingaspnetmvccontrollersizedownherea.  Ive also read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5053248howtopasscomplexviewmodeltoservicelayerinaspnetmvcthis posta that says your service layer shouldnt know about the view model, which makes me think it lives and dies in the controller layer. If the service layer doesnt touch the viewmodel, for example, strong3 is it good design for the codeworkerServicecode to return both codePersoncode and codeWorkercode objects to the Controllerstrongp  pHere are my entity classesp  precodepublic class Record      public DateTime datecreated  get set      public DateTime dateupdated  get set      public string Createdby  get set      public string Updatedby  get set    public class Person  Record         public int ID  get set      public virtual Worker Worker  get set      publiv virtual Defendant defendant get set     ...   public class Worker  Record      public int ID  get set      public virtual Person person  get set      ...   public class Defendant  Record      public int ID  get set      public virtual Person person  get set      ...   codepre

Negative 4025 pIm developing an iPhone app with two SQLite databases.  Im wondering if I should be using only one.p  pThe first database has a dozen small tables each having four or five INTEGER or TEXT columns.  Most of the tables have only a few dozen rows, but one table will have several thousand rows of Items.  The tables are all related so they have many joins between them.p  pThe second database contains only one table.  It has a BLOB column with one row related to some of the Items from the first database photos of the items.  These BLOBs are only used in a small part of the program, so they are rarely attached or joined with the first database rows can be fetched easily without joins.p  pThe first database file size will be about a megabyte the db with the BLOBs will be much larger  about 50 megabytes.  I separated the BLOBs because I wanted to be able to backup the smaller database without having to carry the BLOBs, too.  I also thought separating the BLOBs might improve performance for the smaller tables, but Im not sure.p  pWhat are the pros and cons of having two databases SQLIte databases in particular  to separate the BLOBs, vs. having just one database with a table full of very narrow tables mixed in with the table of BLOBsp

Negative 4025 pIm working on an API wrapper class, which is the first Ive made. For the most part it hasnt been too difficult. Getting to the point where I need to deal with the potential of errors being returned by the API, however confused as to how I should go about dealing with them.p  pAn external file will make a call to the API class, ie, codefindVenueByLocationIDlocationIDcode This function will then construct the URL and method of API call POST, GET, DELETE, etc and pass that to a function called makeCall.p  pMakeCall constructs the completed URL, sends the request to the service and passes back the resulting XML. If the API returns an error, it is within the XML it returns. The URL is called using the function filegetcontents. The API has a set number of error codes it will return in the XML.p  pAs I understand it, I should do the following during the function makeCall p  ul liBefore the XML is returned, check to see if it contains an error code, and if so, pass that to an error handling class to deal with the error. Log and return client version error messageli liadd a try catch around the filegetcontents function to catch any connection errors, ie not being able to access the serverli ul  pIs that considered the best way to do things Should I be adding a try catch around the call to makeCall rather than inside it round filegetcontents Should I be throwing an exception for each error returned by the XML and handling them with an error classp  pThe sort of answer Im looking for should also contain a link to a resource explaining some best practices surrounding error handling with API wrappers or such things.p  pThanks in advance for your time and responses.p  hr  pEDIT After talking with our CTO, errors in PHP at current version ARE exceptions, and I should throw exceptions and leave the dealing of the exceptions to the caller. Remember, Im implementing a wrapper class for an API. Thoughtsp
Negative 4025 pedit Im rewriting almost the entire question because I realized the question was incorrect and confusing. I apologize for this, but the question had incorrect assumptions that made it impossible to answer. I originally tried to simplify it to make it easier to understand, but this made it impossible to replicate my problem.p  pIf I have an codeDataGridcode with a codeMinHeightcode in a codeScrollViewercode, I would expect that as my ViewPort shrinks, the codeActualHeightcode of the element would be decreased until it hits codeMinHeightcode before the scrollbars show up.p  pInstead, it seems that when the datagrids rows cumulative heights add up to more than the codeMinHeightcode, this value overrides MinHeightp  pIs there a way to do this without manually sizing everything and having a ton of codep  pExamplep  precodeltScrollViewer VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto BackgroundRedgt     ltGrid xNameLayoutRoot BackgroundBlack HorizontalAlignmentStretchgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition MinHeight20gt             ltRowDefinition Height80gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt          ltsdkDataGrid AutoGenerateColumnsTrue NamedataGrid1 VerticalAlignmentStretch HorizontalAlignmentStretch MinHeight20 gt         ltRectangle FillBlue Width100 Height80 Grid.Row1 gt     ltGridgt ltScrollViewergt codepre  pIf you were to populate this grid with some rows, if you maximize the window, the grid takes up most of the space and has white space after the rows. If you shrink it down, the layout takes away from the white space until that space runs out, then the root level codeScrollViewercode kicks in, even though codeMinHeightcode has not been reached.p  pIf you replace the codeDataGridcode with another rectangle, the behavior is different obviously. The new rectangle would shrink down to height 20.p  pHow do I achieve this with the grid My requirements are to have nested scrollbars on my SL page which I find distasteful, but its not in my control. The idea is that the top level scrollbars are a last resort of sorts.p
Negative 4025 pIm overriding SaveChanges on my DbContext in order to implement an audit log. Working with manytomany relationships or independent associations is relatively easy as EF creates ObjectStateEntries for any changes to those kinds of relationships.p  pI am using foreign key associations, and when a relationship between entities changes all you get is an ObjectStateEnty that says for example entity Title has PublisherID property changed. To a human this is obviously a foreign key in Title entity, but how do I determine this in runtime Is there a way to translate this change to a PublisherID property to lets an EntityKey for the entity that foreign key representsp  pI assume Im dealing with entities that look like thisp  precodepublic sealed class Publisher      public Guid ID  get set      public string Name  get set      public ICollectionltTitlegt Titles  get set    public class Title      public Guid ID  get set      public string Name  get set      public Guid PublisherID  get set      public Publisher Publisher  get set   codepre  pThere is also EF EntityConfiguration code that defines the relationship and foreign keyp  precodepublic TitleConfiguration      HasOptionalltPublishergtt gt t.Publisher.WithMany             p gt p.Titles.HasForeignKeyt gt t.PublisherID  codepre  pWhat Im doing now seems a bit too complicated. Im hoping there is more elegant way to achieve my goal.

Negative 4025 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm developing a research application that runs on Android phones. In short, the application runs so long as the phone is on and periodically takes information from many components and sensors on the phone. The application is to disturb the user as little as possible. That being said, its draining the battery far too quickly and forces the user to recharge every day. This simply wont do. p  pTo try and figure out how to improve the situation, a colleague also working on the application let the application run for a long period of time and noticed that the biggest battery hog is WiFi. My current idea is to manually shut off WiFi when its not in use in an attempt to save power. AFAIK, Android uses PSM for WiFi to accomplish this to some end, but it doesnt seem to be enough.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pIs there a way to ramp up Androids PSM Or, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3514123androidwifipowerquestionif there is not as this question suggestsa, is there any way that I can safely turn WiFi on and off without adversely affecting the user I.e., is there a way to tell which applications are using WiFi and turn it off when none are Do standard applications  such as the web browser and email clients  use a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidnetwifiWifiManager.WifiLock.html relnofollowWiFi locksa to prevent WiFi from being turned off when they are workingp  pAny advice on where to start in solving this problem are greatly appreciated.

Negative 4025 pI have a need to iterate through an amortization formula, which looks like thisp  precodeR   L  r  m    1  pow 1  r  m, 1  m  t   codepre  pIm using a codeforcode loop for iteration, and incrementing the L loan value by 1 each time. The loop works just fine, but it did make me wonder about something else, which is the value or lack thereof in performing basic operations before a loop executes and then referencing those values through a variable. For example, I could further modify this function to look likep  precode outside for loop amortization  rm1  pow 1rm, 1mt     inside for loop R  L  amortization codepre  pThis way, instead of having to perform lots of math operations on every iteration of the loop, I can just reference the variable amount and perform a single operation.p  pWhat Im wondering is how relevant is this Is there any actual value in extracting these operations, or is the time saved so small that were talking about a savings of milliseconds from a for loop that iterates approx. 200,000 times.  Follow up question would extracting operations like this be worth it if I were doing more expensive operations like codesqrtcodep  pemnote in case it matters, Im asking about this specifically with c in mindemp

Negative 4025 pIm currently building a multilingual website using PHP and MySQL and am wondering what the best approach regarding localization is with regards to my data model. Each table contains fields that need to be translated e.g. codenamecode, codedescriptioncode.... in several languages.p  pThe first idea was to create a field for each language e.g. codenameencode, codenamedecode, codenamefrcode and retrieve the appropriate field from PHP using a variable e.g. codeentry[name . LANGUAGE]code. While it would work, this approach has in my opinion many drawbacksbr you need as many occurrences of each field as you have languages bearing in mind you can have enUS, enCA, enGB...br if you add or remove languages you need to modify the database structure accordinglybr if you have untranslated fields, they are still created for each entry which doesnt seem very optimizedp  pThe second idea is to create a translation table that can be used to store the translation of any field of any table in the databasep  pre  translation  id  INT tablename VARCHAR fieldname VARCHAR value VARCHAR languageid VARCHAR pre  pThe codetablenamecode and codefieldnamecode will allow identifying which table and which field the translation is about, while codelanguageidcode will indicate which language that translation if for. The idea is to create models that would replace the value of the translatable fields e.g. codenamecode, codedescriptioncode by their corresponding translation based on the language selected by the user.p  pstrongCan you see drawbacks with this approach Have you got suggestions to makestrongp  pThanks.p

Negative 4025 pAllow me to explain a little better.p  pI have a VS2010 Solution, split into 2 projects a WCF Web Service, and a Class Library that uses the Web Service.p  pThe WCF Web Service is a simple logging service namespace LogService, service LogService, contract ILogService.p  pWhen you use the Add Service Reference utility that comes with VS2010 to add a reference to the WCF, into the consuming Class Library project, you will see that the tool correctly adds a reference to a Web Service that can be called through LogService.LogServiceClient. No problem here.p  pNow, I have another Solution this is also split into 2 projects another WCF Web Service, and a Web Application that uses this new Web Service. p  pThis particular Web Service provides operations performed on a database namespace BLService, service BLService, contract IBLService.p  pUsing that very same Add Service Reference utility in this project, however, adds a reference whose client name is actually BLService.IBLServiceClient. Please notice there is a I prepended to the service client class name. The utility seems to have decided it should use the contracts name, instead of the services name, to create the service client class. p  pI dont understand why does the tool behave differently on both Solutions. Ive tried checking everything I could from both, and I cant find no significative differences to my knowledge, at least. p  pDo you people know why does this happen What things should I check, and correct, in my Web project or anywhere else in the solution so this odd behavior does not happen anymorep

Negative 4025 pI have a hierarchical relationship defined for one of my tables where the relationship is stored in a separate join table.  The join table also contains information about the type of relationship.  The simplified schema looks likep  precodeBills    ID int IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL PK    Code varchar5 NOT NULL    Number varchar5 NOT NULL    ...  BillRelations    ID int IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL PK    BillID int NOT NULL    RelatedBillID int NOT NULL    Relationship int NOT NULL    ... codepre  pI have FK relationships defined on BillID and RelatedBillID to ID in the Bills table.p  pIm trying to map this in Entity Framework Code First with little success.

Im using collections because the the foreign key properties arent primary keys.p  pUsing this set up I get an error codeBillID column is not definedcode or something similar.p  pIf I got the ModelBuilder route using the following, I get an error that The table BillRelations does not exist in the database.p  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltBillgt.HasMany b gt b.RelatedBills                             .WithRequired r gt r.Bill                             .Map m gt m.MapKey BillID .ToTable BillRelations   modelBuilder.EntityltBillRelationgt.HasRequired r gt r.RelatedBill                                     .WithRequiredDependent                                    .Map m gt m.MapKey RemoteBillID .ToTable BillRelations   codepre  pI have been able to make it work by defining only one half of the relationship, Bills  BillRelations, then using a Join in my repository to fill in an code[NotMapped]code RelatedBill property on the BillRelations class for each of the related bills in the Bills RelatedBills collection.  Id rather not do this if I can help it.p  pThe only other solution Ive thought of is to model each relationship in a separate table there are 4 types and use a standard BillltBill mapping through the join table for each of the 4 relationship types  again Id rather not do this if I can avoid it.p  pCan anyone see what Im doing wrong or tell me if what I want to do is even possible in EF Code First 4.1p

Negative 4025 pI have a fairly simple android app, it gets protobuf data from a web server and has a java class generated by protoc.p  pNow I have no need for any other data than this data in my app. So i thought I would simply use this data rather than wrapping it since this would just be a lot of extra work.p  pHowever sometimes i expand the tree with new data nested messages in proto file and then i need to be able to insert these in the current tree which is not allowed since the java class always returns unmodifiableList.p  pI am now thinking that i could get the list with reflection, thus modifiable. It does not seem like a great solution but it beats doing extra work for wrapping the class and all the stuff therein. So my actual question is, is this a big no no or would it be okay.p  pI read somewhere that even within google they argue if its smart having the protobuf objects as data structure or only as pure sendrecieve messages.p
Negative 4025 pI have a custom layout where the principal behaviour is to grow and shrink a child JTextArea when the JScrollPane its in changes in width.  The scroll pane has the horizontal scroll bar disabled and the text area is supposed to expand and contract so as to avoid needing a horz scroll bar.vFor a number of months, I worked around this using one of the standard layout managers, but now I need some different functionality.p  pWhats happening is that when the user expands horizontally the scroll pane, the layout manager layoutContainer method is called.  It resizes the text area and the text reflows properly.  However, when you shrink the scroll pane, layoutContainer is not called and the text area stays fixed.  Ive put some printlns in the layoutContainer method to make it obvious when its working and not.p  pThe essential thing to note is that the problem happens JTextArea setColumns is called.  I can comment it out and the layoutContainer gets called during resizing.  Of course, then the text area doesnt get resized.  Ive tried also using JTextArea.setSize, with the same results.p  pThanks in advance for any ideas.p  pHeres the codep  precode  SuppressWarningsserial class XTextArea extends JTextArea      XTextArea String text              super text           public int getColumnWidth              return super.getColumnWidth          class PackLeftLayout implements LayoutManager      Component viewPort     Component flexWidthComponent      int preferredWidth  0     int preferredHeight  0            viewPort  if null, compute width as sum of components preferred width       otherwise width will be the viewPorts width.      flexWidthComponent  if not null, this component width will be sized to right        justify rightmost component.     public PackLeftLayout Component viewPort, Component flexWidthComponent              super          this.viewPort  viewPort         this.flexWidthComponent  flexWidthComponent                public void addLayoutComponentString name, Component comp                     public void removeLayoutComponentComponent comp                      Calculates the preferred size dimensions for the specified container, given the      components it contains.      parent  the container to be laid out      Components layed out lefttoright with no additional spacing.     public Dimension preferredLayoutSize Container parent              Insets insets  parent.getInsets         int width  0         int height  0  will become max of all components preferred height           calculate sum of fixed width components  skip the flexwidth component         width  insets.left  insets.right         for int i  0, limit  parent.getComponentCount  i lt limit  i                      Component c  parent.getComponenti             if c.isVisible                              if c  flexWidthComponent                                      Dimension size  c.getPreferredSize                     if size.height gt height                     height  size.height                     width  size.width                                                  determine width of flex width component         if flexWidthComponent  null                      int flexWidth  viewPort.getWidth  width             if flexWidth lt 1                 flexWidth  1              if flexWidthComponent instanceof XTextArea                               some trickery here to get the xtextarea to tell us its preferred height                  given a specific width.                 int colWidth  XTextAreaflexWidthComponent.getColumnWidth                   the following line causes the failure                 XTextAreaflexWidthComponent.setColumns flexWidth  colWidth                  Dimension taSize  flexWidthComponent.getPreferredSize                 width  taSize.width                  if taSize.height gt height                     height  taSize.height                          else                              Dimension size  flexWidthComponent.getPreferredSize                 width  flexWidth                 if size.height gt height                     height  size.height                                preferredWidth  width  already include insets         preferredHeight  height  insets.top  insets.bottom          return new Dimension preferredWidth, preferredHeight                 Calculates the minimum size dimensions for the specified container, given the      components it contains.      parent  the component to be laid out     public Dimension minimumLayoutSizeContainer parent            return new Dimension 10, 10            static int k  0          public void layoutContainerContainer parent              System.out.println layout  k         Insets insets  parent.getInsets         int left  insets.left          if preferredWidth  0  preferredHeight  0             preferredLayoutSize parent          for int i  0, limit  parent.getComponentCount  i lt limit  i                      Component c  parent.getComponenti             Dimension size  c.getPreferredSize              c.setBounds left, insets.top, size.width, preferredHeight              left  size.width                    force another layout calc         preferredWidth  0        public class ResizablePane extends JFrame       public static void mainString[] args              javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater             new Runnable public void run                              new ResizablePane                        ResizablePane               super ResizableDemo           put a button and text area into a panel, then into a scroll pane         JButton button  new JButton button         XTextArea text  new XTextArea              For three years I ran as fast as I could, trying to live and love and learn at               double speed to make up for what AnneMarie lost.

DiskTest.exe is one of 3 projects in my solution  This project builds perfectly for Debug x64, Release x64, and Debug Win32.  Release Win32 is the only one generating these errors.  I have spend hours comparing the properties pages for all 4 configmachine combinations, and am confident that no properties are missing from one version to the next.  I paid special attention to  Additional dependencies, Additional Librari Directories, Input, etc.  Ofcourse, paths to .lib files point to either Debug or Release, and x86 or x64 for the respective config or platform.p  pThe only additional dependency this project has is SBFUtil.lib and SBFUtild.lib for Debug.  I made sure that all 4 versions debug win32 and x64, and Release win32 and x64 of this library exist in the folder specified in each additional library directory  I also checked dumpbin on each version of the library to make sure the platform matches.p  pI have seen other situations where a main entry point is missing, but in this case, all other versions build with no problems, it is only on Win32 Relase version that generates this error, so I dont think I need to change anything in the code.  p  pCan anybody provide any clues, Im out of ideas.  Any ideas will be very much appreciated.  Thanks.p

Negative 4025 pOur team QA is facing the following problemp  pWe have a database that is accessed only by our codeCorecode application which is a codeWCF servicescode app. Our client applications are using the codeCorecode to access the database.  p  pAt some point we were provided with a new Version of our codeCore applicationcode and of our codeDatabasecode. The codeDevcode department also gave us a sql script which is altering a big part of our codedatabase Core datacode. The codecore datacode are used by the codeCore Applicationcode to describe the Logic of our system, so every change on that data may have affects on any of our client applications functionality.p  pMy questions arep  ul liShould we test all of our applications again even if they are already fully tested or is there is a more efficient way to test the SQL script   li listrongIs there a testing techniquetool for data integritymigration testingstrongli ul  hr  pI am looking for a quick validityintegrity testing of the database  after running a migration script. That will prevent us losing time by testing it through the applications. If the validityintegrity testing is successful then we can test the apps.p

Negative 4025 pIm wondering if there is a better way to parse a Varchar to an Int in TSQL  SQL Server.  I say parse because I need something more robust than the CASTCONVERT system funcs its particularly useful to return NULL when the parse fails, or even a default value.p  pSo heres the function Im using now, originally obtained from someones SQL blog cant even remember specifically who...p  pre ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[udfToNumber]      Str varcharmax  RETURNS int AS BEGIN     DECLARE Result int      SET Str  LTRIMRTRIMStr      IF Str OR Str IS NULL         OR ISNUMERICStr0         OR Str LIKE [ 09]         OR Str IN ., , ,                    SET Result  NULL     ELSE     IF CASTStr AS NUMERIC38,0 NOT BETWEEN 2147483648. AND 2147483647.         SET Result  NULL     ELSE         SET Result  CASTStr AS int      RETURN Result END pre  pAnd you could add a line before the end, like if Result is null, set Result  , or something like that.p  pIts not very efficient, because using it in a JOIN or WHEREINSELECT  where say the LEFT column is INT and the RIGHT is VARCHAR, and I try to parse the RIGHT  on any significantly large dataset, takes a lot longer than if I CAST the LEFT INT column to a VARCHAR first and then do the JOIN.p  pAnyway, I know ideally that I shouldnt need to do this kind of thing in the first place if my tablesdatatypes are created amp populated appropriately, but we all know the ideal world is very far from reality sometimes, so humor me.

The first box can have a max of 3 characters, the second box must be exactly 7 and the last needs to be 2.p  pI was trying to get a jQuery function in place to take the user from the first box to the second once theyd typed 3 characters and then from the 2nd to the 3rd after 7 characters and then from the 3rd on to the button after 2 characters.

Im trying to catch it with that ifkeyCode  9 check but because its keyup, the shift key could come up a split second before the Tab in which case the event triggers on the Shift key 16 instead of the Tab 9.  I cant ignore all Shift catches since the user will most likely be using capital letters in at least one of the fields.p  pShiftTab is coming into play when they type in the first value and then realize they made a mistake so they want to go back.  Our workforce is very keyboarddriven so they will almost always use ShiftTab to try to go back and fix that.p  pIs there some trick Im missing for making this work fluidlyp  pTIA.p

Negative 4025 pMy original problem was needing to know the height and width of my root codeViewcode so that I could make programmatic layout changes. For my purposes, I dont necessarily need to determine this information during codeonCreatecode its quite sufficient for me to programmatically add my child codeViewcodes after layout of the root has completed, so therefore Im happy to use codeonWindowFocusChangedcode as a hook to determine when calling the root codeViewcodes codegetWidthcode and codegetHeightcode will return valid results. p  pHowever, I see quite a few people have asked how to determine the root codeViewcodes size during codeonCreatecode. Im guessing people want to do this for better user experience  perhaps so that users dont see the layout being built in stages if anyone can clarify the reasons, Id appreciate it. Now, the answer I have commonly seen given to this, such as the one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3602026linearlayoutheightinoncreateis0herea, is to post a codeRunnablecode to the root codeViewcode within codeonCreatecode. Inside that codeRunnablecode we perform the codegetWidthcode, etc. The reason why this works is because, apparently, codeRunnablecode objects posted to a codeViewcode are executed when the codeViewcode has layout and  or is attached to the window. p  pThis brings me to my question. In the API documentation for codeViewcode, it doesnt seem to describe this behavior. So, can anyone tell me where it is defined and documented Or, is it a matter of inspecting the source Is it an absolutely and rigidly defined feature that codeRunnablescode will stay in a codeViewcodes queue and only be handled at a certain point after the layout processp  pstrongFurther clarificationstrong On reading Kerrys answer and thinking it over a bit more, my basic question can be clarified as follows In the answer given a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3602026linearlayoutheightinoncreateis0herea and also in this a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comTips313848Getactualscreensizefortheapplicationlayout relnofollowCodeProject entrya, I understand that we get around the problem of the root codeViewscode dimensions not being available during the codeonCreatecode by posting a codeRunnablecode to the codeViewcode. As Kerry points out, the guarantee is that this message codeRunnablecode cannot be executed until codeonCreatecode has executed. I understand that layout occurs some point after codeonCreatecode, but I still cant grasp at the moment why this codeRunnablecode should execute when the codeViewcodes dimensions are known. p

Any help is appreciatedp  pstrongADDITIONAL INFOstrongp  pI think I should add why I want the pixel location. I am trying to make a cylindrical roll printer, using a optical rotary encoder providing a location feedback The height of the document represents the circumference of the roll surface, the width of the document represent the number of revolutions.p  pThe following is a grossly untested logic of my ENCreg, pretty much unrelated to the image processing part, but this may help brothers and sisters to see what I am trying to do with the processed array of a tiff image. i is indexed from 0 to imageHeight, however, each element may be an arbitrary number ranging from 0 to imageHeight, could be 112, 354 etc that corresponds to whatever the location that contains black in the tiff image. j is indexed from 0 to imageWidth, and each element there is also starting 0 to imageWidth. For example, ptLocArray[1][2] means the first location that has a black pixel in column 2, the value stored there could be 231. the 231st pixel counting from the top of column 2.p  pI realized that the array[imageHeight][] should be instead array[maxnumblackPixelPerColumn], but I dont know how to count the number of 1s, or 0s per column....because I dont know how to convert the 1s and 0s in the right order as I mentioned earlier..p  precodevoid ENCreg    ifinputPortENCreg  true  true if received an encoder signal                 ENCregTemp   increment ENC register temp value by one each time the port registers a signal                  ifENCregTemp  ptLocArray[i][j]                                      Rollprint  print it                     i  increment by one to the next height location that indicates a black, meaning print                      if ENCregTemp  imageHeight                                           Check if end of column reached, end of a revolution                     j  jump to next column of the image starting next revolution                     i  0  reset i index to 0, to the top of the next column                     ENCregTemp  0  reset encoder register temp to 0 for the new revolution                                                      ENCreg  recall itself               codepre

Negative 4025 pA few month ago I asked a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9421358filenamesearchwithelasticsearchherea. However I cannot get it work properlyp  pI try to build a simple filename search. I want that the user can search  for any part of the filename.br Lets say the following filenames are indexedp  precode[1] Myfile2012.01.12.txt [2] Myfile2012.01.05.txt [3] Myfile2012.05.01.txt [4] Myfile2012.08.27.txt [5] Myfile2012.12.12.txt [6] Myfile2011.12.12.txt [7] file012012.09.09.txt codepre  pThen the user might search forp  precodeile20                    finds the first six documents 12.txt                    finds 1, 5, 6 12 followed by 01       finds 1, 2, 3  NOT 7 2012 followed by 01     finds 1, 2, 3  NOT 7 codepre  pNote Yes, the user might really search for strings like ile20 ... e.g.  because of copyandpaste mistakesp  pTherefore I use a nGramtokenizer to index each part of the filename. This  works fine so far. To support the followed bysearch mentioned above I need a query that  respects the order of the terms, no matter how many text is between these  two terms okay lets say max. 100 characters.p  pSince a textphrasequery with a slop does not respect the ordering of  the terms correctly, I decided to use a spannear query. This works fine  in most cases.p  pSee here my full exampleindex incl. errordescription a hrefhttpsgist.github.com3487909 relnofollowclickap  pAs mentioned in the example above the query 2012 followed by 01 does  not work since the nGram tokenizer generates a positionvalue for each  token, but these values are not very useful when used by the spannear query. While  indexing, the term 2012 is assigned to a position value 50 which is  bigger than the position value for the term 01 e.g. 10. Since 50 and 10  are not in order the query will have no results. The inorderthing works  only correct for terms which have the same length e.g. 12 followed by  01 or if the terms are ordered by length e.g. 20 followed by  .12.p  pSo how can I achieve the correct searchbehaviour I just want the ability  to search for any parts of the filename while respecting the order of the  terms. br Maybe there is a way to tell spannear to not use the position but  instead the startoffset Or is there another query I can usep

Negative 4025 pI am new to web designing, I have searched for an answer and tried almost everything I could find but couldnt get what I want. Ok, I know there are many solutions for sticking a footer to the bottom of the page in a browser. But my question is not about how the footer looks like in the browser, but in the print out. My layout is something like thisp  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt   ltdiv idcontentgt      lttablegt        more divs... more content...      lttablegt       lttablegt         more divs... more content...      lttablegt      ....   ltdivgt   ltfootergt      lttablegt       ....      lttablegt   ltfootergt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd please notice my content is dynamic, it can be long or short based on user input. In browser I dont have any problems, the footer is at the bottom of the content. But in print outs I want this footer to be at the bottom of the last page and I want this to work mainly only in IE browsers. IE 7, 8 and 9. So if the content is long, and it goes to 3 print out pages, the footer should appear only on the bottom of the last page. Please tell me how I can get this done Most online solutions like sticky footer just dont work in the print out when the content is long...They stick to the bottom of the content in the print out as you can see in print previews. I will really appreciate any help. Simple css solutions are better, but if nothing else works out I am ready to try js, PHP as well even though I am a beginner. p

Negative 4025 pI need to read the pixel data from the frame buffer in OpenGL ES 2.0. I know that can be done easily with glReadPixels but since iOS 5 we can use the TextureCached objects for faster reading.p  pI have implemented the solution proposed by Brad Larson  I will be always thankful to him, I think he is doing a great job for the community sharing so much knowledge... in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9550297fasteralternativetoglreadpixelsiniphoneopengles20answertabactivetabtopFaster alternative to glReadPixels in iPhone OpenGL ES 2.0ap  pEverything seems to work, I get the proper data and if I compare it with glReadPixels, the data is identical.

Negative 4025 pI am having an issue with injection working properly with my application. I have been getting this exception Interface not found. To make it simplified I made a new application with simple classes, interfaces and methods to reproduce the issue. CSC.Logging is just a library that I created that contains the Logging attribute that uses ninject interception to log startfinish of the methods. Using it or not using it will still give the same error. So that is not the issue here.p  pI started off by just using ICommonService, CommonService, IUniqueService, UniqueService and the OrderController. I was able to get everything working properly. It was not until I added ICommonDataAccess, CommonDataAccess, IUniqueDataAccess and UniqueDataAccess that I was able to repoduce the issue.p  pIf anyone that may have more experience with Ninject could help me out with how to get around this issue.

Negative 4025 pI have a huge program and Im trying to debug it in VS2010. What Id like to say is break on the first successfully matched message map item, where ever it is in the code, once I activate this option.

I think this would be effectively stop on next line in the code base.p  pThanks, Jamesp

Negative 4025 pI really hope someone can give a well explained example. Ive been searching everywhere but cant find a proper solution.p  pI am taking an introduction to C Programming class, and our last assignment is to write a program which validates a 10 digit ISBN with dashes... The ISBN is inputted as a string in a CHAR array. From there I need to separate each digit and convert them into an integer, so I can calculated the validity of the ISBN. On top of that, the dashes need to be ignored..p  pMy thought process was to create an INT array and then use a loop to store each character into the array, and pass it through the atoi function. I also tried using an IF statement to check each part of the CHAR array to see if it found a dash. If it did find one, it would skip to the next spot in the array. It looked something like thisp  precodeint num[12], i  0, j  0, count  0 char isbn[12]      printf Enter an ISBN to validate      scanf 13[09Xx]c, ampisbn   do          if isbn[i]                i             j                  else              num[i] atoiisbn[j]             i             j                  count      while count  10 codepre  pBut that creates a segmentation fault, so I cant even tell if my IF statement has actually filtered the dashes....p  pIf someone could try and solve this Id really appreciate that. The Assignment was due Dec 4th, however I got an extension until Dec 7th, so Im pressed for time.p  pPlease write out the code in your explanation. Im a visual learner, and need to see step by step.p  pTheres obviously a lot more that needs to be coded, but I cant move ahead until I get over this obstacle.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4025 pMy App involves heavy client side image manipulation.  Since the files are modified so frequently during a users session we do not physically upload them to the server until the user is finished and chooses to save the images.p  pThe images are read from the client using the html5 file API and stored in memory as base64 strings where the user proceeds to perform hisher manipulations quickly and efficiently.p  pWhen the user chooses to save we transfer the string or strings to the server via a standard ajax POST and then build the image into a physical file serverside.p  pWhat I would like to do is provide a progress bar for this final upload stage.p  pNow, I am well aware that the html5 spec includes support for file upload progress reporting.  However we are not using the standard upload methods, instead, as mentioned above the images are sent as strings.p  pSo my question really boils down to the followingp  pA Is there anyway to actual measure the actual bytes sent during a simple post PHP serverside.  If so this would work as I already have the image size in bytes from the HTML5 filereader api.p  pB If not is there anyway I can convert the base64 data into actual files on the fly and send them via the standard html5 upload method, reporting the progress as we go.  p  pIn either case... If so, howp  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 4025 pA model in my Rails application started throwing ActiveRecordStatementInvalid with this message MysqlError Deadlock found when trying to get lock try restarting transaction ... The way I handled this at first is wherever I havep  precodemyModel.updatesaveupdateall codepre  pI wrap it to catch that exception likep  precodebegin   myModel.updateall..  rescue Exception gt e   if e.message.includeDeadlock     retry   end end codepre  pThe problem with this is that I have to rescue this exception everywhere I have an updatesave and that I have to be careful that the retry does do things twice or even worse go into an infinite loop. Is the a way I can address this issue in one spot on the model level like in a callback for example It seems that an aftersave or afterupdate wont do the trick since the exception wouldnt have been thrown at this point yet. Im in Rails 2.3.8 so an aftercommit or afterrollback is not an option for me. Any ideas Thanks p.s I know there are ways to avoid or reduce the chances of mysql getting a deadlock but Im ok with just restarting the transaction after the deadlock happens since in my case the deadlock doesnt happen too oftenp

Negative 4025 pCan anyone point me to some full code samples of how to integrate the a hrefhttpglue.codeplex.com relnofollowGlue frameworka into a project  I am attempting to use it a bit like AutoMapper in that I would hope to be able to register a bunch of conversions to Glue, then arbitrarily hand it two objects for it to figure out from there.  The website gives a good idea of how to make individual mappings, but not how to integrate those into the project at large.brp  pIt would all be abstracted away, of course, so one could do a manual mapping if Glue became too slow or the mapping framework needed to change, but as it stands right now the main usecase I see is creating a lot of codeGlue.Converter.IConvertercode objects and having the IoC container of your choice inject them to wherever they are needed.  This sounds fine, but our project will require dozens upon dozens of these zerocalorie objects if this is the procedure we use.p

Negative 4025 pSo Im intentionally overcomplicating a homework assignment I was given because I was bored and wanted to learn more about c. The original assignment is as followsp  pCompute the average of five exam scores ranging between 50 and 90.  Declare and perform a compiletime initialization with the five values.  Use a constant to define the number of scores.  Display all scores and the average value formatted with no digits to the right of the decimal.p  pSo I decided rather than just putting the 5 scores in, Id allow the user to input them into an array and then calculate it from that.p  precodeConsole.WriteLineEnter 5 test scores between 50 and 90 int i  0 double total  0 double[] Scores Scores  new double[5]  while i lt 5      Console.WriteLineInput Score   i  1       String input  Console.ReadLine     Scores[i]  double.Parseinput     total  Scores[i]     i   Console.WriteLineThe average of the scores is   total5 codepre  pThe issue is that the codeScores[i]  double.Parseinputcode is throwing an error saying that the input is in the wrong format. So the program wont even run to let me put IN an input, but it says the input format is incorrect. p  pAny suggestions Im probably missing something obvious.p  pEDIT Ok, so what ended up working was changing the code top  precodeConsole.WriteLineInput Score   i  1   Scores[i]  double.ParseConsole.ReadLine total  Scores[i] i codepre  pNot sure what it actually changed but it seems to work pretty flawlesslyp

Negative 4025 pI am making some calls to a C DLL of a C library that uses CUDA. Sometimes rarely an error occurs caused by the library I dont have any control of and it causes memory corruption errors in CUDA. So, in order to recover I unload the DLL using FreeLibrary and load it back.p  pHowever, even though I do that the corruption still affects the flow. I need to restart the whole process to recover. I suspect even though FreeLibrary clears all the memory allocated by the C part, the CUDA part is still not unloadedcleaned.p  pI also tried to test if I can successfully loadunload the DLL and it worked when I did that before the corruption error.p  pIs there any way to make sure CUDA memory is unloaded from the process other than  in conjunction with FreeLibraryp  pEdit I am using Visual C on Windows 7 with Cuda 5.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4025 pReading the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangOverride.htmlJavadoca for the codeOverridecode annotation, I came across the following rulep  blockquote   pIf a method is annotated with this   annotation type compilers are required to generate an error message   unless at least one of the following conditions holdp      ul   liThe method does override or implement a method declared in a supertype.li   listrongThe method has a signature that is overrideequivalent to that of any public method   declared in Object.strongli   ul blockquote  pIm clear on the first point, but Im unsure about the second one. p  pWhat does it mean by overrideequivalent How are public methods of codeObjectcode special in this respect And why is this not covered under the first criterionp  pstrongUpdate note This is only true of the Java 7 documentation. The a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangOverride.htmlJava 6 doca doesnt say anything about overrideequivalence. Why the changestrongp  hr  h2strongUpdatestrongh2  pAfter consulting the JLS a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse7htmljls8.htmljls8.4.2Section 8.4.2a, I found the following explanation of overrideequivalencep  blockquote   pThe signature of a method codem1code is a emsubsignatureem of the signature of a method codem2code if   eitherp      ul   licodem2code has the same signature as codem1code, orli   lithe signature of codem1code is the same as the erasure a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse7htmljls4.htmljls4.64.6a of the signature of codem2code.li   ul      pstrongTwo method signatures codem1code and codem2code are emoverrideequivalentem iff either codem1code is a   subsignature of codem2code or codem2code is a subsignature of codem1code.strongp blockquote  pAs far as I can tell, this answers the first question What does it mean and the third question Why doesnt the first condition cover this.p  pIf I understand correctly please inform me if I dont, there is only one case where two methods are overrideequivalent and which emdoesntem fall under the first condition of the original question. This is the case when the emerasureem of the signature of the subclass method is the same as the signature of the superclass method, but not the other way around. p  pThe second condition of the original question, then, would only come into play when we attempt to add type parameters when attempting to override a public method of the codeObjectcode class. I tried the following simple example to test this, with an unused type parameterp  precodepublic class Foo      Override     public ltTgt boolean equalsObject obj          return true       codepre  pOf course, this class doesnt compile, because the method doesnt emactuallyem override the codeequalscode method and thus clashes with it. But I also still receive an error for using the codeOverridecode annotation. Am I wrong in assuming that this is a valid example of the second condition for codeOverridecode usage Or is the compiler generating this error emdespite not being required toemp

In its pom file, all these dependences are declared but maven cant built it error message like these missing artifact projectAjar missing artifact xugglexuggler  ... projectC depends on both and the one file contained in this one is just the pom file.So same error messages there.

Negative 4025 pIm new to MVC and XCode and Im having trouble translating my conceptual understanding of MVC to designing and implementing concrete classes. Im hoping to get a little advice on how to structure the controllers and views to get the intended UI. This is for an OS X app not iOS.p  pMy object model is 3 objects codeBatchcode which has some text members and an array of products. codeProductcode has some text members and an array of images. codeImagecode is basically a path to where the image is stored.p  pThe idea is that the primary view will display a listing of all of the batches thumbnails and titles. Clicking on one will clear the screen and displa the thumbnails for all of the products in that batch. Clicking on a product will clear the screen and open up the product details page which displays the product data and thumbnails of all of the images. Clicking on an image thumbnail displays the image taking up the full window. p  pThe questions are struggling are along the lines ofp  ul liWhich controllers do I use Which do I inherit fromli liDo I use real controllers or codeNSObjectcodes in the XIB objects listli liWhich views do I use Which do I inherit fromli liWhich views can be in the XIB and which have to be dynamically addedli ul  pClearly, I am clueless and Im not finding good tutorials that explain the Why. Any direction is appreciated since my previous attempts are convoluted and almost certainly breaking conventions and standard practices.p
Negative 4025 pI have this bootstrap template where I have to override css to modify the theme. However, the template is using the default grid system of bootstrap, instead of the fluid grid system that I often use. The fluid grid system makes it easier for me to adjust the rest of the spans .span12, .span9, etc without overriding them, since its dynamic. I just had to change the container size.p  pHowever in the default grid system in the bootstrap template .span12, .container are equal to 1200px, although its also responsive, I found out the spans have a default fixed value. So when I setup my css as thisp  precode.container  maxwidth 940px padding 0 20px  codepre  pAnd this seemed to work fine for the rest of the layouts, however when I zoom out and check the website at 1200px, everything goes out in place. I thought I was able to fix it with this p  precodemedia minwidth 1200px  .span12, .container      width 940px   .container      padding 0 20px  codepre  pBut then, the rest of the spans in that layout are still in default fixed width and goes below each other since the container is smaller than before. It doesnt adjust, wc doesnt happen in fluid grid system that adjusts smoothly.p  pFor example, in the 1200px resolution, .span3 has a width of 270px still. So when I put four .span3 divs together, this would add up to 1080px. But this CANT BE because I only need a width of 940px and padding 20px on the sides.p

This Person entity does not have all the fields from the person table.p  pFor example, Person entity does not have zipcode and email, which exists in person table.p  pNow from a query, I get a list of Person entities.

This made me wonder if I have to go create the index data, and, if so, then I might be reaching too far outward from the object to get data that must already be there since the folders obviously know what position to put each child in.

Negative 4025 pI am having difficulties with emacs server closing unexpectedly.  I am connecting over SSH with PuTTY from a Windows 7 machine to an ubuntu machine, using xming to handle x11 windows.  It seems to be something to do with the way putty closes connections.p  pI start an emacs server using codeemacs daemoncode.  I then connect to it using codeemacsclient ccode.  When I close the resulting window, the emacs server stays running, as it should, and I can reconnect using codeemacsclient ccode again.  I can then close the putty session, reopen it, and reconnect again.  This is all as I expected.p  pThe trouble comes when I close the SSH session without first closing the emacs window.  When reconnecting, the emacs server is no longer running.  This only happens when the x11 version of emacs is running.  If I start emacs in the terminal with codeemacsclient c nwcode, the emacs server stays running even if I dont exit emacs before closing PuTTY.p  pIm not sure what could be causing this, or where to look to troubleshoot this more.p

Negative 4025 pCurrently, I have a table view which is populated by video objects depending on the date they were recorded which was taken by using code[nsdate date]code when they were recorded and saved. However, it emisem possible to record multiple videos in one day.

Negative 4025 pSo me and my buddy have been working on an app.  We have an ImageView embedded inside a ScrollView.  It worked on iOS 5, but now we are updating it to iOS 7. We now have to use autolayout to make it look the app look nice again.  But this disables scrolling it.  Weve attempted for a while to add code that allows the image to be scrollable again but nothing has helped.p  pWeve tried everything under the sun we could find dealing with viewDidLoad where we were originally doing it for iOS 5 and viewDidAppear What we added to conform to iOS 7 and better practicality standards.

Negative 4025 pIm using JNDI for datasource defined in our application serverwebsphere and it is configured to manage the db connection pool.

Thanksp  pb[UPDATE1]bp  pFrom a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatecore4.0javadocsorghibernateservicejdbcconnectionsinternalC3P0ConnectionProvider.html relnofollowC3P0ConnectionProvidera Hibernate will use this by default if the hibernate.c3p0. properties are set.p  pBased on the above xml, I already removed the default pooling.

Negative 4025 pIs Javascript the only way to achieve a fullheight sidebar of variable widthposition where the main content responds by adjusting its own widthp  pWhat I have been working to achieve is to have a fixed, fullheight sidebar slide in from the side and have the main content to its right respond by adjusting its width. I hope to achieve this using only css and no js or percentage widths.p  pI know that I can achieve a fixed sidebar of variable width, but it requires js to adjust the margin property of the main content area.

Negative 4025 pOk, I have a question to which, despite my best efforts, I have not been able to solve. I searched the internet, and this is one of those that is particularly difficult to search for, but it seems that no user of Windows 8.1 nor any developers developing for Windows 8.1 has posted to any website asking how to do this I could be wrong, of course.p  pWhat I am trying to do is make a Windows Store app targeting Windows 8.1, that takes advantage of multiple Windows. To see what I mean, open up metro ie, right click on a tab, and click open in new window. This is also in the mail app, where you can open a single message in another window, which behaves like a separate app, and can be snapped like so. Its a new feature of the Windows 8.1 OS.p  pBut I cant for the life of me figure out how to do it in C and XAML. Does anyone know how Thanks.p  pAlexp

Negative 4025 pI am trying to write a translator that translates VM language in Intel x86 assembly language MASM. Unfortunately I cannot find a proper translation for lt less than, gt greater than or eq equal, but I would expect that there is something like that in the instruction set.

But nothing without a jump.p  pFor example when I want to translate if x1 and xlt3 do ... the VM code looks something like p  precodepush local 0 push constant 1 gt push local 0 push constant 3 lt and ifgoto IFTRUE0 codepre  pmy problem is now that I dont know how to translate that gt and lt as they are not directly followed by a jump, but rather are both part of a single jump condition.p

Negative 4025 psolved, see the commentsp  pRecently Ive been working on an API that has to interface with an already existing service.

As this is my first real project in CL, I think Im not fully understanding the packagingloading mechanisms going on here.p  pMy basic problem is that I have a bunch of code that uses macros to generate functionsclasses, interns them into my package, and then exports certain functionsaccessors that people will eventually use to interact with the API. If I load the files individually like sop  precodeload srclispclbitcoinbitcoin.lisp load srclispclbitcoinclasses.lisp load srclispclbitcoinfunctions.lisp codepre  pEverything works well. The functions declared by my macros are interned and exported correctly and Im able to call them to interact with the API. However, if I attempt to do the followingp  precodeqlquickload btc codepre  pQuicklisp tells me that everything was loaded properly  and it seems that most of the loading process happened as I expected since all of my dependencies are loaded and available for use.

It tryed ffmpeg b 100k an f video4linux2 s 320x280 r 10 i devvideo0 b 100k f ogg   ssh userremote vlc p  pwhich doesnt work because before I have to export DISPLAY0.0 on the remote machine before I can launch vlc.

Negative 4025 pI am trying to build a simple minded model. Hosting console application trusted API assembly and low trust client plugin assembly. For this I created a console app which builds minimum appdomain with minimum permissions, i built a trusted API and signed it, loaded API assembly into new domain and called file writing method.

Negative 4025 pI am creating a TicTacToe game in which a square in the grid is represented by a class called Square which I created. It extends JButton, but I added a boolean field called empressableem which states whether or not the button can be pressed ingame. If the button already has a letter, then it cannot be pressed. I want to implement code in my actionPerformed method that will check the empressableem variable, and if empressableem is false, it will not change the letter of the square. I am using the getSource method on my ActionEvent to give me a reference to the square pressed. Therefore, I need to cast the Object to type Square so that I can access its empressableem field. But when I do this, I get the following error codejava.lang.ClassCastException javax.swing.JButton cannot be cast to tic.tac.toe.Squarecode This makes no sense to me. Before I needed each square to have a empressableem field, I used a JButton, which worked just fine. But since Square inherits JButton, I would think that it would work as well. How can I fix this  p
Negative 4025 pIll try and ask this as accurate as possible as I dont exactly understand my assignment.p  pBasically we had to create 3 HTML controls or JS controls and for each control we had to add an event handler thatd read something from a control and show it in a DIV.p  pNow my question is, how can I save the information shown in that DIV.

So, in the costructor, I pass a embooleanem isEditable parameter, which is a field, to the .isEditable method for all the JTextFields, so that after the JFrame shows and the editButton is clicked all that happens is that the isEditable value changes to emtrueem, and the whole JFrame is repainted. The problem is that the JFrame is refusing to repaint What can I do I would be really grateful for any help I get.

Negative 4025 pI know what Connection reset by peer means, and probably this was already answered but I couldnt find it so sorry.p  pIm making a client and server in TCP, and the server supposedly should be 247 when its good to go but when I close the client, send and recv fails because of Connection reset by peer.

Negative 4025 pI am trying to get Unity dependency injection working with a WCF service that utilises Entity Framework, but Im getting confused about the use of context and repository.p  pThe way I have designed it is to have a number of repository classes eg UserRepository, MessageRepository, LocationRepository, each of which accepts an EF DbContext object as a constructor parameter. This lets me control the Unit of Work at the context level, by calling context.Save or rollback etc to control transactioning across repositories.p  pThe confusion Im in is that Im not sure how to represent this in dependency injection. I want to have two scenariosp  pa When the WCF service is instantiated via the WCF methods, I want it to use the DbContext class I have created and to create repository objects, passing in the created DbContext that will connect to the Entity Framework database.p  pb When the WCF service methods are tested from a separate test project, I want to mock the repository objects to return mocked data.p  pIf I was just using repository classes, this would be relatively simple as in each WCF service method I could call Container.Resolve and then I could use the Unity WCF factory to set the concrete types for WCF instantiation, and manually configure the Unity container in my test project for the mocked types.p  pBut the difficulty is the fact that my repositories need a DbContext class to be passed in as a constructor parameter that will survive beyond the lifetime of the repository and I also need to be able to have a reference to it in my service methods, for examplep  precodepublic bool CreateUserDbUser user      try              using var context  new MyDbContext                      var repository  new UserDataRepositorycontext              user.GenerateUserLight             user.GenerateUserProfileLight              var result  repository.InsertItemuser             repository.Save              return result                   catch Exception ex              return false       codepre  pHow can I adapt the above method to use Unity Dependency injection so I can mock it for the test projectp

After having googled for drawing ellipse in OpenGL I cant believe that all of several dozens recipes that I read on this topic  all of them are dealing with manual construction of ellipse out of points or lines in the for loop. I know that for instance GLUT or SFML have functions for drawing circles, but they are not specialized graphics libraries and also they dont draw arcs. What I need is a simple library without any context management or windowing functionality which can draw basic 2D shapes into a buffer.p

Negative 4025 pI need to write a program in order to analyze SELinux policy. Indeed, existing programs such Apol or Sediffx from SETools dont match my needs. In order to importuse SELinux policy, I intended to use SETools library libqpol, libapol, libpoldiff, libsefs. I do have the corresponding .jar but I cant find out how to use them. There is no documentation... And I cant find tutorials or some codes about them...p  pThats why, I call directly SETools commandline tools sesearch, seinfo from my java program, and then parse the response. In this way I can reconstitute the SELinux policy.p  pBut this seems a bit rough... Do you think there another way to do it Do you know how to use  SETools libraryp

Negative 4025 pI was wondering if there is a way to configure the collection type to Generic List instead of any array on the client end programmatically. I know if we add service reference and go to advanced settings we can specify there. But the way the project is designed is that we have separate assembly for the contracts and is referenced by both the server and the client and also the model types are defined in the same project which are used by both the service and the client. So instead of adding a service reference we are doing everything in the code by defining the bindings and endpoints programmatically. I want to know if this is something that can be achieved in code easily without writing code to convert the arrays into generic lists on the client end. p  pThanks, Ajayp

Negative 4025 pIs it possible to add a handle to a promise such that it gets executed at the end of the promise chain. I know there is codedonecode and codefinallycode, but they execute after the emcurrentem promise is resolvedfails, not the whole chain.p  pEDIT The actual case is Basically I have a function allocating a db connection and executing a db query, and returns a promise that gets resolved when the query completes, passing the connection and result. The function also sets up a query method on the connection  that returns another promise, so queries can be chained on the same db connection by calling the query method from a then handler and returning the returned promise. The db connection has to be free once all handles are done. Currently I just require the user of the function to manually free the connection in the last then, and I autofree it in error handlers.p

Negative 4025 pIm using strongD3.jsstrong to generate a graph with response times over time. Previously I was using Google Charts but it was too heavy. D3 is nice and lightweight, but theres something I cant manage to do that I could do with Google Charts.p  pThe problem is that those graphs sometimes span over one week, sometimes over one day, sometimes over one hour. For each case I have to manually modify how the ticks in the X axis appear. Im doing it by comparing the first and the last values for the X axis, and checking how much time theres between them, like thisp  precodeif dateDif lt 25   daily     xAxis  d3.svg.axis         .scalex         .tickFormatd3.time.formatHM         .ticksd3.time.hours, 3         .orientbottom   else if dateDif lt 170     weekly     xAxis  d3.svg.axis         .scalex         .tickFormatd3.time.formatdm HM         .ticksd3.time.hours, 24         .orientbottom  else   more than weekly     xAxis  d3.svg.axis         .scalex         .tickFormatd3.time.formatdm HM         .ticksd3.time.hours, 96         .orientbottom  codepre  pBut that its not good, at all, specially when there are just a few values in the chart theyre generated every minute, then no ticks appear because it falls in the first case, and there are no enough values to span 3 hours.p  pDo you know of any plugin or method that automagically adapts the X axis for this kind of situationsp

If I add any new model, i have to manually refresh the page every time to make the delete buttons work on them.

Negative 4025 pIm using the codeKitware VTKcode library to display 2D images.  Ive recently begun work using the codevtkWindowToImageFiltercode to output images in various formats.  Everything was looking great until I worked at home today and I began to realize that codeVTKcode rendering doesnt seem to work when you are running software on your work machine through Remote Desktop.p  pWhen I output an image while NOT running in Remote Desktop, the image that gets output only consists of the codeVTKcode window.  But when I run this same process while using Remote Desktop, the output image comes out in the correct size, but does just a normal screenshot basically, and other UI elements outside of the codeVTKcode window are showing up.p  h2Questionh2  pWhat is it about Remote Desktop and codeVTKcode that causes the differences Im seeing  Is there anything that can be done to support outputting images from codeVTKcode windows while using Remote Desktopp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4025 pThis question is based on my understanding from section Java Garbage Collectors of a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comwebfoldertechnetworktutorialsobejavagc01index.html relnofollowlinka Looks like jvm by default uses Parallel GC on windows 7 as i confirmed it XXPrintCommandLineFlags version. This article also saysp  blockquote   pThe parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads to perform the   young generation garbage collection. This collector should be used when a lot of   work need to be done and long pauses are acceptablep blockquote  pemi am not sure which collector is used for tenured space collection by Parallel GCemp  pAlso i could not think of applications where long pauses are acceptablewill cause less responsiveness. Anyone would like to less pauses for GC and make app as responsive as it can.p  pThen i read codeConcurrent Mark Sweep CMS Collectorcode which collects the tenured generationp  pCMS says codeit require low pause times and can share resources with the garbage collectioncode. p  pemMy question is should not most of web applications use Concurrent Mark Sweep CMS Collector because of its responsiveness.em I am sure there must be some other factors also to make the decision but after going thru this link to me feels like i should change the default GC type to Concurrent Mark Sweep CMS Collector. Any thoughtsinsightsp  pFurther i think application can be best if we use CMS Collector and parallel collector together where CMS is used for old generation and parallel fpr younger generationp

However, after that everything falls apart  codeReaderTcode is in no way an codeEithercode value, and everything henceforth uses codeErrorTcode, which Id like to change to codeEitherTcode.p  pMy idea, then, was to define a codeMonadEithercode type class that boxed codeleftcode and coderightcode in order to handle errors, but this hasnt been fruitful.

Or would then be a problem with ambiguity Im just wondering if the compiler shouldnt be able to deduce U.

Negative 4025 pIn Windows 8.1, the desktop still exists when a Windows Store ModernMetro tiled app is active, correct Im assuming this because of the speed of manually switching back and forth.

I have also tested the game without Ads and that improves the framerate by a significant amount and reduces lags, but they are still there on iPhone 4. p  pWhenever the game scene is presented, I initiate both iAd and AdMobbanner and have them request a banner. If iAd succeeds, that one is displayed, if not, AdMobs banner is moved to the visible area.

Negative 4025 pWe recently migrated our codedui project from VS2010 to VS2013.

Negative 4025 pI need an algorithm for splitting a convex polygon lets call it strongbasestrong polygon. The polygon should be splitted into several smaller polygons by another polygons edges lets call this one the strongsplittingstrong polygon. I know there exist algorithms for strongclippingstrong a polygon f.e. the SutherlandHodgman algorithm, but these algorithms discard the vertices that are lying outside of the splitting polygon instead of creating new polygons with them. I dont want to clip a polygon, i want to split it into several small parts. I know the answer seems quite obvious because I would just have to extend the existing algorithms. The problem is that I cant figure out a nice and performant way of doing this. Are there existing algorithms that describe how to best split a polygon in a performant way There has to be a simple solution for this problem that I cant figure out at the moment.p

To test this I used developer provisioning profile. First I installed the previous app DataProtection is off in my pass code enabled device and made sure that  users documents are available in the Documents folder. Then I turned on Data Protection in my provisioning profile and rebuilt the app using that new profile. Then I installed it on top of the previous app. Then I locked the device and downloaded the app sandbox using Xcode and noticed that I can access sandbox without any problem. I did it several times, but sandbox is still accessible. p  pThen I deleted the app and freshly installed the app that I had Data Protection turned on. Then I downloaded the app sandbox and I noticed that all folders in the sandbox including Documents folder are empty. p  pThat means Data protection working only on freshly installed app. Am I doing anything wrong I want to turn on Data Protection on my existing apps as well.

Negative 4025 pI have a UIScrollView of height 80 content size height is also 80, and small UIImageViews with thumbnails of size 70x70 added as subviews in a horizontal row. Everything works but when I present and dismiss a view controller modally, I see the thumb views are all screwed up and are depressed downwards and the scrollview can now scroll horizontally and vertically. I checked contentOffset as well as contentInset and there is nothing wrong in any of these values. Not sure why the scrollview is increasing content sizeinset in the vertical direction. p  pFYI, I have a CADisplayLink also setup for AVPlayer and have seen previously that this also strangely messes up UIScrollView for unknown reasons.p  pEDIT  I see by not adding AVPlayer to CADisplayLink, the problem disappears. Really not sure why adding GLKView screws up another UIScrollView. Any body knows any workarounds p

Negative 4025 pI am writing a C WinForms application, .NET 4.0.p  pI have a WinForms codeControlcode on a codeFormcode. After user starts typing something using keyboard, another codeControlcode appears. That codeControlcode is some kind of text input. Id like to send user input to that codeControlcode. Of course, after it gets focused, it receives all user keyboard input.

Negative 4025 pI recently started using a hrefhttpfacebook.github.ioreact relnofollowReacta and a hrefhttpfacebook.github.iofluxdocsoverview.html relnofollowFluxa for a project of mine, and Im using jQuery too, for some parts of the GUI. Via jQuery, I sometimes add CSS classes and styles and even DOM nodes to elements created and updated by React. This seems to work just fine. React doesnt complain, and, when coderendercode reruns, React doesnt modify the classes and styles and the DOM nodes that has been added somewhere deep inside a react root.p  ul lipCan I rely on React ignoring DOM nodes Ive added side by side with React DOM nodes inside a React tree  I understand that the nonReact nodes will be removed, if React decides to remove the node into which I inserted them. This is fine with me. But I do wonder if React some day in the future will get upset on these additional nodes not managed by React, and refuse to workpli lipIf React doesnt manage any styles of a DOM node I havent added any codestylecode attribute to the nodes generated by coderendercode, then can I via jQuery safely add my own styles to this DOM node E.g. look up a node by codeidcode in jQuery and then set its width.pli lipIf theres no codeclassNamecode on a DOM node generated by React, can I then safely via jQuery add and remove classes to this node For example, add a class on mouse hover.pli ul  pOne reason Im currently doing these possibly weird things, is that I have some jQuery soup legacy code that I dont want to port to React right now. Another is that Im using some jQuery plugins that sometimes add DOM nodes inside the React tree.p

Negative 4025 pI have a job that has run without problem for months.  It runs on both our testdev server and our production server.  The databases and jobs are identical in both environments.  p  pA few days ago, the job stopped working in the production environment.  It still works fine in the testdev environment.  p  pThe job runs for Stored Procedures.  I was first alerted to the problem when someone notified me their query wouldnt work.  I found the job, which normally takes about 12 minutes had been running for 3.5 hours.  It had hung on the third SP.  It runs every 3 hours and had run fine the previous scheduled time.p  pI killed the job and since, cannot even do the first SP.  The first SP has four steps 1. Retrieve data from a linked server into a temp table works fine. 2. Delete data from a regular table where the date range matches that retrieved from the linked server.  3. Insert the data retrieved into the regular table. 4. Rebuild indexes.p  pThe data retrieval from the linked server works find and I can see the data in the temp table, query it, etc.  However, when it goes to delete step, nothing seems to happen.  It uses CPU, but a process that normally takes 35 seconds based on history, will go forever it seems.  Ive let it go as long as 45 minutes before cancelling the process.  p  pdbcc checkdb shows no errors.  I have restarted SQL Server, then rebooted the physical server, checked hard disk space, rebuilt all indexes, examined memory and so forth.  I have no clue where to go next.p  pAfter rebooting the physical server, I immediately retried the first SP before anyone or any other processes could cause a contention issue and still had the same results.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThank you.p

Negative 4025 pI have a asp.net mvc application, that relies on data being provided by a windows service. Its kind of like a video conferencing application, where the video streaming operations are provided by the windows service. The communication between the asp.net mvc application and the windows service is through a remoting interface that is created inside ApplicationStart method. The interface object is a static variable that is a part of the class derived from HttpApplication.p  pThe video streaming service may be online or offline. Once a service goes offline and then comes back online again, I have to reinitialize certain state information in the asp.net mvc application. p  pWhat is the most reliable way to keep track of this. Should this be done using a background thread Is there any other way to achieve this safely The remoting interface exposes a Ping method which returns a unique string to indicate that the service is online.p  pAny pointers would be appreciated.p

Negative 4025 pAfter I trained a model in Gensim python implemented Word2Vec, I got a 1GB for example .vector file on the disk to store the result of the Word2Vec. When I use this data, the program will load the model from the file on the disk. However, this process is really slow, for example, 1GB file needs 15 minutes loading on my computer.p  pSo, my question is is there any open source solution on the Word2Vec result storage for faster query Like putting the data into memcached, mongodb, or mysql, etc.p  pP.S.

Negative 4025 pIf your object being serialized is marked with code[JsonObjectIsReference  true]code it will be serialized with an codeidcode property, which will consist of an incremented integer value for each distinct object reference in the graph of objects being serialized. p  pBut if the objects are serialized independently, joined together, and then deserialized aka chatty GET, chunky POSTPUT, these values need to be rekeyed, or errors will be thrown on deserialization and the resulting graph will be incomplete as duplicate references will be ignored. p  pIn most cases though, objects already have their own unique IDs ie guids. p  pIve worked around this in 2 ways p  ol liTurn off reference preservation, and li liAdd a dummy property to the object which merely exposes the native ID, and decorating it with code[JsonPropertyid]codeli ol  pAnd while I dont currently care about reference counting, I may in the future, but I dont like having duplicate properties in my resulting JSON for the same guid value.p  pstrongSo Im wondering if there is a way to force NewtonSoft to use the codeidcode property already on my object in place of the codeidcode propertystrongp  p[ Alternatively, I could mark the objects ID property with code[JsonPropertyid]code and change all JSONconsuming code to use that codeidcode property instead of codeidcode .. but I just dont like that idea..

Negative 4025 pIve been trying to wrap my head around this problem for 3 days, but every idea I investigated turned out to be a deadend.p  pId like to have a list of presenters speakers in a tableView. Im using the edit button in the upper right corner of my tableView to unhide or hide a addSpeakerCell at the end of all objects that are currently being displayed. This works nicely and without problems. I can delete objects and toggle the edit button and everything works as it is supposed to.brp  pBut when getting to the addSpeakerView via the addSpeakerCell and add a speaker, when hitting the savebutton and getting back to the tableView, the following warning appearsp  pstrongcodeInvalid update invalid number of rows in section 0.  The number of rows contained in an existing section after the update 1 must be equal to the number of rows contained in that section before the update 0, plus or minus the number of rows inserted or deleted from that section 0 inserted, 0 deleted and plus or minus the number of rows moved into or out of that section 0 moved in, 0 moved out. with userInfo nullcodestrongp  pMy guess is the addSpeakerCell is not updated with the new indexPath. But then I still couldnt find out how to solve it...p  pIf someone could kindly point me to the right solution or even provide me with the necessary codesnippet, I would be eternally grateful p  pMy

Since these hrefs doesnt start like thisp  precodehrefnode... codepre  pThey arent redirected by Proxypass, and thus result in a 404 error.p  pI cant just change all the hrefs  that would mean I need to do it all over again on my 3 environment  development, production and test, and even if I did that, everytime Ill use Grunt to test my app, it automatically rebuild my index.html anyway. Besides, it doesnt solve everything, there are some problems with socketio appearing when I do thatp  pOnly thing I can do then is using ProxyPass like this p  precodeProxyPass  httplocalhost8000 codepre  pThere it does works, absolutely no problem, just like if I actually was using the app on from my server on localhost.p  pThe only remaining problem is that I need to have 2 environments on my server, on for production and on for tests, and I just cant dop  precodeProxyPass  httplocalhost8000 ProxyPass  httplocalhost8001 codepre  pIt obviously wont work since everything will be redirected to port 8000 bvefore anything can reach the second line.p  pSo, Im left with only two options  p  pEither find another solution than using  as criterion for redirecting to localhost8000 that would work in the same manner and I didnt find anything workingp  pOr use virtual hosts... And there goes another problem  Im really not confortable with network issues, from what I understood, to have several virtual hosts on the same machine, I need several CNAMES one for each virtual hosts, but I dont know how to list  add CNAMES my server runs on Windows Server 2008 with no access to the world wide web, and I dont have any DNS application in my Administrative Tools as Im supposed to according to this  a hrefhttpstechnet.microsoft.comengblibrarycc753579.aspx relnofollowhttpstechnet.microsoft.comengblibrarycc753579.aspxap  pAny help would be very welcome Thanks in advance p  pEDIT  I really think that my solution is to twitch my Apache configuration.

Negative 4025 pIm working on a simple texas holdem poker simulation. A 10 handed poker game should be dealt out and the winning hand should be saved somewhere. Im only writing this to practise c, especially classes and objects. I might want to extend the capabilities of the simulation in the future if I come cross other interesting things to practise. Because of this Im aiming for a very general, easy to extend baseline.p  pSo far Ive made classes for cards a vector that holds the suit and rank and a deck a vector that holds 52 cards. There is the option to shuffle a deck or to take cards from it.p  pThe problem comes with the representation of the actual game. I need to represent 5 famility cards and 10 sets of 2 hole cards. My first idea was to use a vector for the family cards and a vector for all the holecards but this looks really messy as shown below the setCards return the remaining deckp  precodedeck newDeck newDeck.shuffle table newTable newDeck  newTable.setFamilyCardsnewDeck newDeck  newTable.setHoleCardsnewDeck  card  newDeck.takeCard  not nessesary, just to show  vectorltvectorltcardgtgt allHoleCards  newTable.getHoleCards codepre  pI think this should show the problem I have without showing too much code. The vector in a vector doesnt feel great to work with. Not to mention the card object in there is also a vector emWhat would be a better, cleaner, way to represent the boardstate in a game of pokeremp  pSorry for the rather vague question, but I dont know how else to put it.p

Negative 4025 pI am working on a program that takes two command line arguments.  Both arguments should be dates of the form yyyymmdd.  Since other folks will be using this program and it will be requesting from mysql, I want to make sure that the command line arguments are valid.  My original thought was to loop over each element of the incoming string and perform some kind of test on it.  The  would be easy to check but Im not so sure how to handle the digits, and to distinguish them between ints and chars.  Also, I need the first date to be less than or equal to the second but Im pretty sure I can handle that.p

Negative 4025 pI have an Android application that uses a native JNI library. I put it into codeappsrcmainjniLibsarmeabiv7acode without any gradle configuration and Android studio happily bundles it into the APK.p  pI have a requirement where all native libraries cannot be bundled with a certain distribution. Is it possible to create a build variant or build type that simply excludes all native libraries maybe even by name code.socode.p  pThe fact that the native library is missing in this distribution doesnt matter because its not used. The alternative is to physically remove the files, run the build, put them back. However, this is painful and error prone.p

Negative 4025 pIm trying to solve a large number 50 of nonlinear simultaneous equations in Julia. For the moment Im just trying to make this work with 2 equations to get the syntax right etc. However, Ive tried a variety of packagestools  NLsolve, nsolve in SymPy and NLOpt in JuMP where I ignore the objective function and just enter equality constraints without much luck. I guess I should probably focus on making it work in one. Id appreciate any advice on choice of packages and if possible code. p  pHeres how I tried to do it in NLsolve using it in mcpsolve mode so I can impose constraints on the variables I am solving for  x[1] and x[2]  which are unemployment rates and so bounded between zero and 1 p  precodeusing Distributions using Devectorize using Distances using StatsBase using NumericExtensions using NLsolve  beta  0.95                                                                 xmin 0.73                                                                  xmax  xmin1                                                              sigma  0.023                                                             eta  0.3                                         delta  0.01                                                                                                 gamma0.5                                                                    kappa  1                                                                   psi0.5 ns50 prodlinspacexmin,xmax,ns l10.7 l20.3                                             wbar1 r1beta11e6 delta    Test code  function fx, fvec  ps1 wbar  kappa1beta1sigma1x[1]x[1] ps2 wbar  kappa1beta1sigma1x[2]x[2]  prod1prod[1] prod2prod[50] y11x[1]l1 y21x[2]l2 Mprod1y1psi1psiprod2y2psi1psi Kreta1eta1M  pd11etaKetaMetaprod1 pd21etaKetaMetaprod2  fvec[1]pd1ps1 fvec[2]pd2ps2 end  mcpsolvef,[0.0,0.0],[1.0,1.0], [ 0.3, 0.3] codepre  pI get this error messageimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXR8TH.png alterror messagep  pAny suggestions very welcome I appreciate the formulas are pretty ugly so let me know if any further simplifications helpful I have triedp

There is some other stuff going on, but I wanted to leave it in so you could get the whole picture. The null pointer exception points to line 157. Its an IF statement.p  precodepackage Phase2  import java.io. import java.util.  import javax.swing.JOptionPane  import static java.lang.System.out  public class Phase2    DEFINING ARRAYS amp VARIABLES       MAIN METHOD   public static void main String[] args      int menuSelection      startprogram      menuSelection  Menu      switchmenuSelection              case 1             Modifymember             break          case 2             Modifyregistration             break          case 3             Report             break          case 4             endprogram             System.exit0       END SWITCH CASE STATEMENT   END MAIN METHOD     METHOD to run once at start of program   public static void startprogram       VARS amp ARRAYS FOR startprogram METHOD     String newLine      int count  1     int[] memberCode  new int[100]     String[] memberType  new String[100]     String[] firstName  new String[100]     String[] lastName  new String[100]     int[] age  new int[100]     char[] gender  new char[100]      int menuSelection  0     String menuOutput     int i      String memberTypeInput      try              BufferedReader membersFile  new BufferedReadernew FileReadermembers.dat          while newLine  membersFile.readLine  null                              StringTokenizer delimiter  new StringTokenizernewLine,                  count  count1                 memberCode[count]  Integer.parseIntdelimiter.nextToken                 memberType[count]  delimiter.nextToken                 firstName[count]  delimiter.nextToken                 lastName[count]  delimiter.nextToken                 age[count]  Integer.parseIntdelimiter.nextToken                 gender[count]  delimiter.nextToken.charAt0               END WHILE          membersFile.close      END TRY      catchIOException error              out.printlnThere was an error on file read   error      END CATCH             MENU           menuOutput     tMoon Area YMCA  n                      1.

In such a way that if I want to know the details of the name in table info  I could go to the other table and see all the values. p  pSo I researched about how to import this xls format file and the optimal solution will be convert  the xls file to a csv file delimited by comma. p  pTherefore, the code which I was thinking to use is after converting to csv delimited by comma the followingp  pBut the point is that I just want to to the followingp  ul liInfo Table     name1,info1,info2,info3.li liContact Table  name1,address,phone1. li ul  pstrongRelated to Info Tablestrongp  precodeLOAD DATA INFILE homeusernamemyfile.csv  INTO TABLE numbers FIELDS TERMINATED BY   LINES STARTING BY  TERMINATED BY rn  IGNORE 1 LINES  contact,col1,col2,col3 codepre  pIt is ok when Im filling the table because I just have to add a  at the beginning of the row which I want to fill into the table the row which contains a nonempty field. p  pstrongRelated to Contact tablestrong p  pIt is being difficult since, if I want to take just the column of contact I will have to add some symbol and then operate. Well, I was thinking in add an  for instance at the beggining of name1 and another one at the end of phone1 for defining the boundaries of the LINE. But I want to define also the fields, which will be a  as well. However, the algorithm of LOAD DATA INFILE takes the empty fields also. And I just want to take the fields which contains something different than empty stringnull. So the question is if I would be able to say something to avoid the empty string. Because as a I read in the a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1enloaddata.html relnofollow titleMySQL docMySQL DOCa this is written    p  blockquote   pAn empty field value is interpreted different from a missing fieldp      pFor string types, the column is set to the empty string.p      pFor numeric types, the column is set to 0.p      pFor date and time types, the column is set to the appropriate zero value for the type. See Section 11.3, Date and Time Types.p blockquote  pBut it does not say anything about avoid it. I mean, If is an empty value, then pass the the next field and evaluate again until find a nonempty value   p  pI am asking that because with my idea of face it It will fill a row like that  Name1,null,null,null,address1,null,null,null,phone1 and so on.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 4025 pI am using jPlayer for a website plugin that plays MP3 files which are transmitted from a Server. When you include the main script in a website a button is added to the DOM structure that allows the user to open the player. When this button is clicked the structure of the player buttons for playpause, back, forward, stop is added by createElement and appendChild. Also an instance of a second script called playback will be included. This script manages the state of the player. Clicks on the player buttons call functions in the playback script.p  pNow when you press play for the very first time, the jPlayer object will be initialized, before finally the function playCurrent is called to play the current MP3 file in the queue.p  pThe initialization of the jPlayer objectp  precodejQueryplayerID.jPlayer         swfPath scriptPath  jquery.jplayer.swf,         ready function              if stoppedByError                   move the cursor to part 0 and play it                 if singleStringMode                      moveCursor0                                     console.logFIRST START                  update the player status                 setPlayerStatus1                  play the current text part                 playCurrent                      ,         ended functionevent              if stoppedByError                  self.goToNext                      ,         errorAlerts false,         supplied mp3,         error functionevent              if stoppedByError                  handlePlayerError                        codepre  pThe code to start the playback in the function playCurrentp  precodejQueryplayerID.jPlayersetMedia,      mp3 textParts[currentPart].mp3     ogg sample.ogg .jPlayerplay codepre  pOf course the assigned URL of the MP3 textParts[currentPart].mp3 is checked before this code to make sure the MP3 has successfully been transmitted from the server.p  pAll of this works fine on desktop PCs in Chrome, Firefox and newer versions of IE. However, on some mobile devices iOS, Android there is a strange bug When you press the play button for the first time, it changes to a pause button, but the playback does not start. Only when you press the button two more times once to pause the playback and one more time to start it again, everything works as in desktop browsers.p  pI am aware that jPlayers autoplay generally does not work on mobile devices, so this option is just turned off on mobile. But I can not find any good explanation why the playback fails at the first attempt. I used jConsole for mobile debugging and there wasnt any error. One thing that I tried was to assign some silent dummy MP3 file to the jPlayer instance in the ready function to really make sure that some audio is available when the player is started for the first time, but it didnt help either.p  pThis doesnt seem to be a general problem of jPlayer as I tested the demo sites for MP3 playback on the same devices and it works just fine. What is also very odd that the problem does not apply to Windows Mobile, just iOS and Android.p  pAny suggestions what could go wrong in the process of initializing jPlayer and starting it for the first timep
