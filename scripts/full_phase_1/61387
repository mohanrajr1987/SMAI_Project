Positive 61387 pWe have an single page application developed in angular js using nodejsnpmgrunt . I am tyring to integrate this into an asp.net 4.5 mvc project. For the most part of it, I was able to preserve the DEV environment by using the new task runner functionality in VS. I changed the build events to run npmbower install and do a grunt build before the .net code builds. But I realized that our build server isnt connected to Internet and thus cant restore node and bower packages  I am not able to checkin the node packages into TFS as some of the have very long paths that are incompatible with most of windows tools. Is there any way to get around this issue i.e. can we install node amp bower packages from offline source on the build servers Thanks.p

Positive 61387 pIm a bit of a n00b when it comes to nodejs npm, but since implementing it in our build environment using steps recommended on several articles its tripled our build times.p  pWe use it for the standard stuff minifyconcatetc jscssetcp  pWe use TeamCity and have added a Node.js NPM step then a gulp step to run the tasks RE a hrefhttpsgithub.comjonnyzzzTeamCity.Node relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjonnyzzzTeamCity.Nodeap  pThe task to setup NPM takes the most time, 2min 10 seconds, which is over 65 of the total build time calling the command npm install, which appears to redownload all the packages on each buildp  blockquote   pStep 37 NPM Setup Node.js NPM 2m10sp      blockquote     p[npm install] Starting cmd c npm installp   blockquote blockquote  pOut total build times before were around 1min 30sec, including unit tests.p  pis there anyway to cache these locally and prevent redownload on each build in the user profile or something maybe as apposed to the build folderp  pstrongMore detail..strongp  pThis probably best explains the setup a hrefhttpwww.dotnetcurry.comvisualstudio1096usinggruntgulpbowervisualstudio20132015 relnofollowhttpwww.dotnetcurry.comvisualstudio1096usinggruntgulpbowervisualstudio20132015ap  pWe have C projects that are using the new Task Runner Explorer, Dependencies are saved into a package.json by this, you prerun npm install once on your local environment in you workspace need to use a .tfignore to prevent it from checking in to source then not again, unless you start a new local workspace.p  pWhen the build run it needs to run npm install from the command line and it picks up dependencies from the package.json file and installs them into a sub folder inside the working directory of the build every time, even if the files are already there forma  previous buildi.e. TC agent hasnt cleaned them up, afaik you cant install them outside the working folder. p  pI could be wrong... Or i should say i hope im wrong, and looking for a way for gulp to support this, but what ever way we make it work will need to work with task runner explorer so the F5 experience for the dev is still the same on their local.p  pWe do have multiple agents yes.p

Negative 61387 pAlthough the a hrefhttpwww.adobe.comdevnetpdfpdfreference.html relnofollowPDF specificationa is available from Adobe, its not exactly the simplest document to read through.  PDF allows documents to be encrypted so that either a user password andor an owner password is required to do various things with the document display, print, etc.  A common use is to lock a PDF so that end users can read it without entering any password, but a password is required to do anything else.p  pIm trying to parse PDFs that are locked in this way to get the same privileges as you would get opening them in any reader.  Using an empty string as the user password doesnt work, but it seems section 3.5.2 of the spec that there has to be a user password to create the hash for the admin password.p  pWhat I would like is either an explanation of how to do this, or any code that I can read ideally Python, C, or C, but anything readable will do that does this so that I can understand what Im meant to be doing.  Standalone code, rather than reading through e.g. the gsview source, would be best.p

Negative 61387 pC offers three floating point types float, double, and long double. I infrequently use floatingpoint in my code, but when I do, Im always caught out by warnings on innocuous lines likep  precodefloat PiForSquares  4.0 codepre  pThe problem is that the literal 4.0 is a double, not a float  Which is irritating.p  pFor integer types, we have short int, int and long int, which is pretty straightforward. Why doesnt C just have short float, float and long float And where on earth did double come fromp  pEDIT It seems the relationship between floating types is similar to that of integers. double must be at least as big as float, and long double is at least as big as double. No other guarantees of precisionrange are made.p

Negative 61387 pI have a section of my site where users can add addresses to their account.  They may add as many as they need shipping, billing, etc.p  pI set things up so that after an address is added, the users sees the address in an update form with a save and delete button.  The user can adjust any of the addresses they have added.p  pThe problem I am having is with validation.  Lets say Line 1 is required.  If I am updating the second of three addresses and leave Line 1 empty the controller is raising an error using the same technique from Nerd Dinner, BTW.  This is good.  What is bad is that all of the address info on all of the addresses listed in the view, now show as values from the address where the error was raised.p  pI know this has something to do with model binding, but I am confused, as the form data is set up as followsp  precodelt Html.TextBoxLine1, Model.Address.Line1gt codepre  pThe Model that is passed in is unique to the address we are on in the list of client addresses.  I am not sure why the value in Model.Addres.Line1 is being overridden by data in the ModelState ModelErrors Collection.  I guess the default behavior is to use the values from the errors collection when they are present.  This is a problem when there is more than one form on the View and the form is using the same Names for input fields as each of the other forms.p  pIs my only workaround to avoind the Html Helper function here and hardcode the inputs in HTMLp

Negative 61387 pstrongBACKGROUNDstrongp  pI need to write a tool using .NET version 2.0 at highest using something off the shelf is not an option for this client for political, commercial, and confidentialitytrust reasons to migrate files from one server to another over the network. The servers are file servers for local teams, and certain team folders need to be migrated to other servers to facilitate a reorganisation. The basic idea is we read each file and stream it over the network out of hours and after a few days the data will be migrated. File permissions need to be preserved. As this will take a few days we are talking up to several gigabytes of data, for some teams, we need to iterate over the files each night and compare the modification dates and update those that have changed. The theory is that eventually the new server will have an up to date copy of the files and the users can switch over to the new server. It is of course not quite this simple, but we have a design we think should work p  pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrongp  pSo in theory we just open the file, stream it over the network, and write it at the other end, right p  pUnfortunately, on the servers themselves, the file shares were created at folder paths such asp  blockquote   pDDataTeam SharesDIVISIONDEPARTMENTNAME OF TEAM  COULD BE FAIRLY LONGp blockquote  pFor each user, this path is mapped to a drive, for example it would be shared as SERVERTEAMNAME and mapped to the T drive.p  pThis has caused the situation where the files as visible from the T drive are within the codeMAXPATHcode limitation, however when viewed locally on the server itself, they go way beyond it. We cannot access the files using the network shares as this tool needs to be generic, to run on hundreds of these servers, and there is no standard way to tell which file shares are  ones we should be moving and those which are not  there is no naming convention standard even. Also, occasionally there are subshares of other shares and so we exceed the codeMAXPATHcode limit twice overp  pI am aware of the workaround to specify paths using the  prefix, which treats the path as a UNC path and allows a theoretical maximum of 32k characters. p  pThis workaround is implemented at the Win32 API level, the System.IO namespace is mostly basically just a thin wrapper around native Win32 API functions, however Microsoft have helpfully implemented extra incorrect validation before handing the call off to the API. In this case, the .NET Framework is rejecting the path because it claims that  is an invalid path character.p  pSo my question is... is there a way I havent thought of that will allow me to work around this without having to completely rewrite the almost the whole System.IO namespace, making a load of PInvoke calls, just to remove this annoying validationp

Negative 61387 pLets say you have a classp  precode    class C             int  i        public           Cint  viv            void method const  this method does not change i          void method        this method changes i      codepre  pNow you may want to define const instance of this classp  precode    const int  k  whatever     const C c1k this will fail codepre  pbut this will fail because of nonconst int Cs constructor Cint  vp  pso you define a const int constructorp  precode    Cconst int  viv  this will fail also codepre  pBut this will fail also since Cs member int  i is nonconst.p  pWhat to do in such cases Use mutable Casting Prepare const version of classp  pedit After discussion with Pavel below I investigated this problem a bit. To me what C does is not correct. Pointer target should be a strict type, that means that you could not for example do the followingp  precodeint i const int  ptr ptr  amp i codepre  pIn this case language grammar treats codeconstcode as a promise not to change pointers target. In addition codeint  const ptrcode is a promise not to change pointer value itself. Thus you have two places where const can be applied. Then you may want your class to model a pointer why not. And here things are falling into pieces. C grammar provides const methods which are able to promise not to change fields values itself but there is no grammar to point out that your method will not change targets of your inclass pointers. p  pA workaround is to define two classes codeconstCcode and codeCcode for example. It isnt a royal road however. With templates, their partial specializations its hard not to stuck into a mess. Also all possible arguments variations like codeconst constC amp argcode, codeconst C amp argcode, codeconstC amp argcode, codeC amp argcode dont look pretty. I really dont know what to do. Use separate classes or constcasts, each way seems to be wrong.p  pIn both cases should I mark methods which dont modify pointers target as const Or just follow traditional path that const method doesnt change objects state itself const method dont care about pointer target. Then in my case all methods would be const, because class is modelling a pointer thus pointer itself is codeT  constcode. But clearly some of them modify pointers target and others do not.p

Negative 61387 pGreetings cake experts, I have a question that I think would really help a lot of people getting started with cakePHP. I have a feeling it will be easy for some of you, but it is quite challenging to me.p  pI have a simple database with multiple tables. I cant figure out how to make cakePHP display the values associated with a foreign key in an index view. Or create a view where the fields of my choice the ones that make sense to users like location name  not locationid can be updated or viewed on a single page.p  pI have created an example at a hrefhttplovecats.cakeapp.com relnofollowhttplovecats.cakeapp.coma that illustrate the question. If you look at the page and click the list cats, you will notice that it shows the locationid field from the locations table. You will also notice that when you click add cats, you must choose a locationid from the locations table. This is the automagic way that cakePHP builds the app. I want this to be the field locationname.p  pimg srchttpimgur.com7pizH.png altalt textp  pThe database is setup so that the table cats has a foreign key called locationid that has a relationship to a table called locations.p  pimg srchttpimgur.comRTMqC.png altp  pThis is my problem I want these pages to display the locationname instead of the locationid.

Negative 61387 pI have been trying to install Haskell Platform and codecabalinstallcode installed on Linux in userspace on a system that doesnt have the GNU MultiPrecision package GMP installed.p  pI managed to get GHC6.12.1 installed and GHCi working by setting up codeLBLIBRARYPATHcode to point at the lib directory where I installed GMP, but then ran into problems in the next step, getting codecabalinstallcode to work. It kept trying to statically link to GMP.p  pThis fails because the GMP is not installed in the system and codeldcode hasnt a clue where to find the libraries, and there is no environment variable that I am aware of that can tell ld where to find the userinstalled GMP, and apparently no way of telling configuring Cabal to supply the relevant codeLcode flag.p  pAfter much fruitless searching and hacking attempts I hit on the absurdly simple idea of installing my own codeldcode shell script that invokes the system codeldcode with the appropriate codeLcode flag.p  pThis is shell scripting 101, of coursep  precodebinsh usrbinld LHOMEgnulib  codepre  pWith this script installed in a directory on my codePATHcode ahead of codeusrbincode all the problems seem to have gone away.p

Negative 61387 pBasically my problem is that Im trying to write a method that finds a random path in a graph of strings, which takes as its parameters a start string, an integer length and a Vector of strings that will store the path. Im attempting to do this by first adding the starting string to our blank vector, recursing through its neighbors until the vectors length not including the start node is the same as the integer length specified in the parameters. Ive provided my code so far herep  precodepublic VectorltStringgt findRandomPathFromString n, int len, VectorltStringgt randomPath     randomPath.addn      if randomPath.size  len  1         return randomPath      for String m  this.neighboursn         if randomPath.containsm ampamp findRandomPathFromm, len, randomPath  null             return randomPath           path.setSizepath.size  1     return null   codepre  pIt seems to be working fine, returning a path with exactly the number of strings specified after the given start string. However, for any given starting string it generates the EXACT same path everytime, which kind of defeats the purpose of it being a random path generator. Im guessing this problem is related to my for each loop, which loops through all the neighbouring strings of your current string. It seems to just be going with  the first string in the neighbours vector every single time. Can anyone help me fix this problem so that it will choose a random neighbour instead of going in orderp  ptldr  Any way of getting a for each loop in java to process a collection in a random order as oppoosed to starttofinsihp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 61387 pIm not doing much new development right now, but a lot of refactoring of older C subsystems whose original requirements no longer support new and Ill add unexpected requirements. Im also now using Rhino Mocks and unit tests where possible vs 2008.p  pThe dilemma for me is that to make the methods testable and mockable, I need to define clear contracts using interfaces. However, if I do this, a lot of the global data that many of the classes use turns into tramp data, passed from method to method until it gets to its intended user this looks ugly, and is against my sensibilities, but ... can be mocked. Making a mixed bag class with a lot of static global properties is a more attractive option but not Rhino testable. Is there a middle ground between the two Testable but not too trampy Pattern perhapsp  pYou should also understand that these applications run on an inhouse corporate developed platform, so there are a lot of helper classes and services that are instantiated once per application, and then are used throughout the application, for example a database accessor helper class. Another example is using configuration files that are read once, and used throughout the application by different methods for various reasons.p  pYour thoughts appreciated.p

After that I am not touching variableA, it is used only in the Thread B, so locking is probably not necessary.p  pBut, is it guaranteed that the main thread will flush his cache and write the variableA contents to the main memory, so the second thread can read the newly assigned valuep  pAdditionally, is it guaranteed that the second thread will read the variableA contents from the main memory May some compiler optimizations occur and the Thread B can read the variableA contents from the cache instead of the main memory It may happen when the order of the instructions is changed.p  pFor sure, adding emvolatileem to the variableA declaration will make the code correct. But, is it neccessary I am asking because I wrote some code with some non volatile variables initialization in the constructor, and the variables are used later by some Timer threads, and I am not sure if it is totally correct.p  pWhat about the same code in Javap  pThanks, Michalp

Negative 61387 pTechnology ASP.NET 4.0, C, formsmvc p  pI am a .NET web designer and I wish to create a modular based website for people, similar to what DNN does but I want to create my own cut down version.p  pThe idea is that I create a base website that can activate features which the client needs and has paid for.  These features may be used by many clients which require frequent future updates for all clients so I wish to keep upgrade time down to a minimum.p  pFor example, I upload the base web application using web deploy and it sets up the core database tablesviewsSPs in the process.p  pThen I login into the website as developer and activate the out of the box features that I wish to permit the user to take advantage of.p  pThe only way I can think of currently is via user control, resources etc..p  pBut I need a little of your experience and advice over what the possibilities  dangers are....p  pe.g. images for an application e.g. blog, that I have activated for a client  how do I reference those images p  pe.g. Can user controls be dynamically added to a web application which is precompiled unlike a website  it must be a web application since I am using web deploy.p  pe.g. Modification of web.config to add additional routing doesnt matter if app has to go down to do this.p  pThe idea is that I can upgrade websites features enmass, rather than manually enhancing each individual website which given a certain amount of clients would result in an awful amount of time lost.p  pI do not have access to sharepoint nor do I intend to.p  pAny advice on how to automate modularity completely via a front end in asp.net would be superbp  pMy main problem is how to reference files and resources outside of the websites directory and without using virtual directories ideally  but open to suggestions.p  pThanks, Dan.p

Also take into consideration that I have to step through multiple files, as these programs make extensive use of libraries, and the bug itself appears to be within one of those libraries. So e.g. I know I need to continue executing until I hit line number of file. Also the libraries are loading libraries, I was at least 35 libraries deep the last I checked.p  pemnote Im new to debuggers in generalemp

Negative 61387 pI have a custom subclass of UITableViewController that uses a set of custom subclass of UITableViewCells.p  pThere is nothing too fancy. The table cells have two subviews in their content view.p  pRight now I have the user select a cell, a navigation controller pushes to a color selection screen. The user selects a color. Great. The table view is a delegate of this view. It receives the color, updates the selected cell so that the subview now uses this background color, and then pops the current view from the navigation controller.p  pIt all works The tableViewController slides back into view and the indicator in the cell now displays the background color the user selected. BUT after the table view appears, the cell selected cell gets a blue highlight applied to it automatically. This is some built in magic from the TableViewController. Its nice but its resetting my cells indicator status.p  pProblem is, I cant find out where to properly update the cell to this new color. The color is stored as an ivar in the tableViewController. So I thought trying this out atp  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didDeselectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath codepre  pBut alas this method doesnt fire as a result of the magic UIKit is doing to briefly highlight the cell. Any ideas where I need to update my cell properlyp

Negative 61387 p Let me put my question as simple as below. Mine is a network router software built in erlang, but at a particular scenario I am observing very high memory growth as shown by VM. p  p I have one process which receives binary packet from some other process from socket. p This process, parses the binary packet and passes the binary packet to a genserver handlecast is called p p The genserver again stores some information in ETS table and send the packet to the peer server. p When the peer server responds back the entry from the ETS is deleted and the genserver responds back to the first process p Also if the first process which sent packet to genserver gets timedout after 5 seconds waiting for response from genserver , it also deletes the ETS entry in the genserver and exits. p p  p Now I am observing high memory growth when lots of events gets timed out due to unavailability of peer server and from what i have researched its the binary and processesused given by erlangmemory command thats using most of the memory. p but the same is not true when events are processed successfully. p p

Negative 61387 pWe are planning to launch our application in production.  The application has numerous modules  PHP code on Apache, tomcat java applications, C code applications. All these modules need to connect to MySQL database.p  pWe would like to separate the application and the database into two separate security layers by putting a firewall in between. This is to completely isolate DB servers from any not relevant access to protect sensitive data. The firewall will only allow connections from the servers running the application to the DB servers on MySQL port.p  pUsually, firewalls will drop connections if its idle long enough. This can badly effect connectivity between applications and the database. The connection failure needs to be detected and reinitiated by the application and this logic is not implemented everywhere.p  pQuestion 1.  If making the application more tolerant to the lost connectivity scenario is not an option, what is the best way to resolve the problem Can firewall be set in a way which will not cause this behavior Not expiring the connections at all will fill the connection table and crash the firewall. To set the expiration time to higher values can also risk filling up the connection table at peak times and it is not always clear which time interval is long enough 2.  Will such security layering schema bring any real security benefits in the first placep  pThank you in advance.p  pJulio.p

The whole idea is to be able to call any java code from inside my javascript code without having to build new java libraries.p  pDoesnt that mean that I cant use Rhino Nodejs uses the V8 engine to execute javascript, so I assume that a single javascript file cant be used by both V8 and Rhino...I was hoping that I could call java methods, which would start up Rhino which would translate those calls to Java. Java itself would then return the variables filles with some data. p  pPeter Why http calls Both my javascript and my java lie on the same server for now.

For instance, I might need to sort the 28th35th row. This will be passed to this program by the variable stronginRangestrong.  However, I also want to be able to configure the sort priority and how each column gets sorted strongeverytime I run the macro.strong note that a row can only change position as a whole, individual cells within the row cannot change positionp  pI have the following Global arrays which describe the headersp  pstrongheadRowstrong  contains an array of the header names as strings listed in order of the columnp  pstrongprLststrong  contains an array of integers input as strings that determine priority of each of the headers.  The position of the integers in the array is the column number which they describe.p  pstrongcolIsStringstrong  contains Boolean determining if items listed in a given column are strings or integers.  True  string, False   Integer. Again, position position of booleans in the array is the column number which they describe.p  pstrongsortOrderstrong  containing booleans specifying orientation of sort. True  ascending.

Negative 61387 pIn my project, I have 3 webapplications, all depend on one codeallcommonscode project.p  pIn my Jenkins server, I built 4 jobs, codeallcommonsRELEASEcode, codewebARELEASEcode, codewebBRELEASEcode and codewebCRELEASEcode.  The role of these jobs is to build the artifacts, which are deployed on our Nexus. Then, someone retrieve these artifacts in Nexus and deploy them on our dev  homologation servers.p  pWhat I want, is to have one additional job that will launch all the 4 builds, in a sequential way. This way, once this job is finished, all the RELEASE jobs have been executed. Of course, if one build fails, the process is stopped.p  pMy first thought was to indicate the codewebARELEASEcode in the emBuild other projectsem list of the emPostbuild Actionsem of codeallcommonsRELEASEcode. Then, codewebBRELEASEcode is dependent on codewebARELEASEcode, and so on.p  pHowever, I want to be able to start any of them separately, which is not possible if I indicate a dependency on the projects. For example, if I manually start codewebBRELEASEcode, then codewebCRELEASEcode will be built after that, which is not what I want...p  pDo you have any idea how I can achieve that, or a plugin to help me to do thatp  pRegards.p  pps Jenkins 1.430, and all RELEASE jobs are freestyle projects they mix Maven and bash commands.p

Negative 61387 pI have a page with a form inside an iFrame.  the form is rather long so the iframe is long.

Negative 61387 pFor some reason if I tab through my radio buttons and use the arrow keys to select different ones the current radio button is selected. I can tell because theres a blue highlight circle around it Google Chrome. But if I click a radio button with the mouse, that blue circle is not there.p  pThe problem is that Im trying to create a smooth tab flow through my page. If the user uses nothing but tab and arrow keys, it works fine. If they use nothing but the mouse, it works fine, obviously because tabIndex would be irrelevant.

Negative 61387 pIm currently trying to do some GPGPU image processing on a mobile device Nokia N9 with OMAP 3630PowerVR SGX 530 with OpenGL ES 2.0. Basically my applications pipeline uploads a color image to video memory, converts it to grayscale, computes an integral image and extracts some features with the help of several fragment shaders.p  hr  pThe output is correct, however the runtime of the program is somewhat confusing.

But can this really have this much of an influence Especially when considering that the feature extraction step consists of multiple passes with different fragment shaders and FBO switches, but is still as fast as expected.p  pParticulary odd is the performance drop 2. during the integral image computation, because its a multipass operation, using only one shader and pingpong render targets. If I measure the performance of codeglDrawcode for each pass, the drop happens only once among all passes and always at the same pass nothing special happening in this pass though.p  pI also suspected memory constraints to be the cause, since Im using quite a few texturesFBOs for my output data, but alltogether Im occupying 6 MB video memory, which really isnt that much.p  hr  pIve tried codeglDrawElementscode, codeglDrawArrayscode and codeglDrawArrayscode with VBOs with the same outcome every time.p  pAll timings have been captured withp  precodeglFinish timer.start render glFinish timer.stop codepre  pIf I leave out the calls to codeglFinishcode, the timings are the same, though.p  hr  pDoes anyone have an idea, what I could be doing wrong Im not too savvy with OpenGL, so maybe someone can point my to a direction or something I should look out for. I know this is hard to answer without any code samples, thats why Im asking for rather general suggestions. If you need more info on what Im doing precisely, Ill be glad to provide some code or pseudo code. I just didnt want to bloat this question too much...p  hr  h2Edith2  pI think I found the reason what causes the performance drops it seems to be some kind of waiting time between two shaders, where the OpenGL pipeline waits for a previous fragment shader to finish, before it hands the output to the next fragment shader. I experimented a bit with the rgb2gray conversion shader and could isolate two casesp  p1. The second rendering with the rgb2gray shader depends on the output of the first rendering with itp  precodeinImg gt rgb2gray gt outImg1 gt rgb2gray gt outImg2 codepre  p2. The second rendering does not dependp  precodeinImg gt rgb2gray gt outImg1                                      inImg gt rgb2gray gt outImg2 codepre  pIt is of course obvious that variant 2. will most likely be faster than 1., however, I dont understand why the pipeline completes with a reasonable runtime the first time it is executed, but has those strange delays afterwards.p  pAlso I think that the runtime measurement of the last pipeline step is always inaccurate, so I assume 280 ms to be a more correct measurement of the feature extraction step not 3 ms.p

Negative 61387 pNot having much luck getting help from any of you Spring gurus on here. Hopefully this time I word the question better so it makes more sense. Ive got a fairly basic Spring app using a Mysql database. Basically I just want to know the proper way to load data into a SELECT object on a form, but I need the entire process.p  pHere is a bit more depth. Ive got a Job object that is stored in a Job table in the DB. Its tied to a form that a user can fill out to populate the Job object. The Job object also has a Many to One relationship with a Filter object that is stored in a seperate table in the DB. So when the user is creating a Job object with the form, there is a SELECT box that is loaded with Filter objects for them to select. So far all of my code to do that works fine. The filter objects are displayed and then stored in the DB properly so I believe I have that part down right. The problem comes when a user attempts to edit a Job object. I load the form and all the data from the Job object is correctly prepopulated into the various boxes, except that the SELECT box is not automatically set to the Job objects stored choice. The SELECT object is getting loaded with Filter objects, but its always set to the first choice instead of say the 4th or whatever happens to be stored in the Job object. So clearly Im not doing something right or missing some vital aspect of this process. If anyone can help me out here I would truly appreciate it. This is a bug in an application for work that Im trying to fix and I cannot seem to find the solution.

Negative 61387 pI am integrating a customized MenuStrip control into another .NET application. The MenuStrip works fine except for a focus issue. If the form hosting the MenuStrip is not focused, the user is required to click twice  once to activate the form and another time to select the menu items. The host form is a part of the separate .NET application which I cannot modify. I can only modify my controls source code.p  pI found a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3057473disabletherequirementtodoubleclickanunfocusedwindowwhenclickingonasolution at the WinForm levela which overrides the Form WndProc method, except I do not have source code access to the WinForm nor can I recompile the host application and form.p  pIs there a way to subclass the ParentForm of a Control, so that it automatically Activates the ParentForm if it is not focusedp

Negative 61387 pIm teaching programming to beginners starting at 1215 years old and one of the choices we made because it was natural in Python was to teach the notion of repeating an action before the notion of variables.p  pWe warted in Python withp  precodefor loop in range10 codepre  pwithout speaking about variables of arrays and in C withp  precodedefine repeatnb forint loop  0  loop lt nb  loop codepre  pThe idea was to hide the complexity of a classical loop in order to insist on the repeat part. We are not hiding from the students the fact that repeat10 is not a part of C,  its just a way to simplify the learning.p  pIn Pascal we cant do much more thanp  precodefor loop  1 to 10 do codepre  pbut thats ok because itss not that difficult to remember.p  pI was looking for something similar in Java and I found that  p  precodeimport java.util.List import java.util.AbstractList  class Range      public static ListltIntegergt sizefinal int end          return new AbstractListltIntegergt              Override             public Integer getint index                  return 0  index                          Override             public int size                  return end                              public class Main       public static void mainString[] argv      for int loop  Range.size10          System.out.printlnxx            codepre  pThep  precodefor int loop  Range.size10 codepre  pis still easier to remember thanp  precodeforint loop  0  loop lt 10  loop codepre  pbut there is two problems p  ul litwo variables are needed for imbricated for loops  I dont think we can do much about thatli liwe are having warnings because the variable codeloopcode is not usedli ul  pDo you see a better solution that what we have p  pOnce again, we only want to provide some tool at the beginning phase in order for the students to repeat actions, before knowing anything about variables. We are not hiding from them thats is not in the langage and after a few exercises 80100 we are asking them to use the real syntax.p  phr We have approximately 20 exercices before introducing variables  some about printing texts but mostly we are providing one library with objects you can manipulate hence the variables are hidden in the object state. You can think of the logoturtle for example. This way the notion of loop can be manipulated and seen before introducing explicit variables and you can have interresting exercises really fast.p  pOne example, in Python, where you want to visit every case of a 10x10 table once and only once and then be back at your starting point lowerleft corner  p  precodefrom robot import   top for loop in range4    for loop in range8       top    right    for loop in range8       bottom    right for loop in range8    top right for loop in range9    bottom for loop in range9    left codepre  pThis exercise is not that easy but the syntax is really simple and allow the student to concentrate on the algorithmic part and not the langage part. After a few exercises the students are getting interrested and we can introduce more syntax and more difficult concepts like the variables.p

Negative 61387 pI was wondering if it was possible to extract the contents of a .jar file into a different directory, then add some files to that directory, and then compress the directory back into a .jar file, with the additions. A way of extracting the jar file i found was to use codeNSTaskcode to execute the terminal command of codejar xf location of jar filecode. This worked, but it halted the UI of the program permanently without crashing it, and unarchived the contents into the directory that the application was stored in, which was a slight mess to clean up.

Negative 61387 pI have a seesaw ui with a text editor. The editor content is backed by a record called Task which is contained somewhere in an atom called state. A keyreleased event on the editor should change the property desc of the Task. I use the following codep  precodedef state      atom tasks []             interval nil             style style foreground black background nil  defn ontextedited [ui listenerfn]   let [editor select ui [editor]]       listen editor keyreleased         fn [evt] listenerfn text editor  defn updatetask [task text]   let [newtask assoc task desc text         tasks replace task newtask tasks state]   swap state      assoc  tasks tasks  def textupdates ontextedited frame updatetask selectedtask  codepre  pemselectedtaskem is an atom referencing the current content model of the editor. Whenever the user edits text the updatetask function is supposed to be called. But nothing happens. The function seems not to be called at all. When I call it from the repl it behaves as expected.p  pI tested if the function would get called by letting it do a simple printlnp  precodedefn updatetask [task text]    println str task   text codepre  pNow the function works fine when I edit text in the editor. Then I changed it top  precodedefn updatetask [task text]   let [newtask assoc task desc text         tasks replace task newtask tasks state]      println str task   text codepre  pnow again, it would do nothing at all. So it seems that somehow the accessing of the atoms get in the way of the event handling. Is there maybe a conflict between the ui thread and the thread the atoms were defined inp

Negative 61387 pGood day friends Im experiencing one huge problem here First, I posted a question last year here regarding how to set a proxy in the JVM, so that an Lotus Notes Agent programmed in java could get through a web service also in java. I Finally found the problem after a couple of weeks of research, and it now works So, now its time for us to move that in a user testing environment... Guess what Doesnt work But, Im not facing the same problem. In fact, to set the proxy in the JVM, I need to set the property http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort. So, I got the Domino servers administrator to change the java.policy file on the server so that I can access to those properties I got them copy the development version of the java.policy and paste it in the UAT version. No luck The exact same code replicated on another server with the exact same policy file behave two different ways... I get thisp  precodejava.security.AccessControlException access denied java.util.PropertyPermission http.proxyHost write codepre  pWe tried inverting the permission granting, we tried giving the permission to http.proxyHost and proxyHost. Nothing worked... So, I got them to remove all permission in the grant section without codebase and put only AllPermission. It worked My guess would be that we have an error in the policy file, so that the permissions are not taken care of. I was wondering if you could give me a hand on this...

Negative 61387 pI have a form in my Cocoa app that contains an NSSegmentedControl that I want to be controllable via the keyboard. It seems that NSSegmentedControl is very reluctant to become the first responder, however.p  pSetting the initial first responder of the window to the segmented control does nothing  it will not have keyboard focus when the window is first loaded. It does receive focus if I manually set the first responder like this, howeverp  pcode [segmentedControl.window makeFirstResponder segmentedControl] codep  pThat will work fine if the only part of the form is the segmented control. If I add another field say, an NSTextField, and I set the nextResponder of the segmented control to that field, the segmented control will never become first responder. Focus will immediately go to the text field, and pressing tab to switch back to the segmented control doesnt work.p  pIve tried subclassing NSSegmentedControl and overriding acceptsFirstResponder, becomeFirstResponder, etc. to no avail. The only one that makes any difference is resignFirstResponder  if I return NO from that method then the segmented control will indeed retain focus, but obviously I dont want it to retain focus all the time.p  pAny ideas on how to get the control to behave like a normal responderp

We have looked at the Steam API, and to find this information, it requires the persons 64 bit ID steamID64 and we, on the website, are only given the username. In order to find their 64 bit id, we have tried to scrape off of a website codesteamidconverter.comcode to get the users 64 bit id from their username. We tried doing this through the javascript, but of course we ran into the cross domain block, not allowing us to access that data from our google App Engine website.p  pI have experience in Python, so I attempted to figure out how to get the HTML from that website in the form of codesteamidconverter.compersonsusernamecode with Python.

Negative 61387 pI need to generate virtual events for a tkinter window running in a separate thread. Calling codeeventgeneratecode from nongui thread is supposed to be safe and it works well, when tkinter runs in the main thread and events are generated in another thread. p  pFor a certain reason I need that the statements generating the events run in main thread more specifically, I want those statements to be in the toplevel of the module. p  pBut, when I do coderoot  Tk root.mainloopcode in a new thread and coderoot.eventgenerateltltmyeventgtgtcode in the main thread, I get stack overflow. When I swap the threads coderoot  Tk root.mainloopcode in the main thread and coderoot.eventgenerateltltmyeventgtgtcode in a new thread then everything works again.p  pI have taken care that root is fully construted and also idle, before I try generating the event. p  pAny ideas how to get this setup workingp  pIm using Python 3.2.3p

Negative 61387 pI asked a similar question a while ago but I didnt know very much, so I wasnt able to be specific enough.p  pI want to write a program that takes input from my microphone, processes it, and then sends the output to a fake virtual microphone as if the processed sound I created was what a microphone was hearing. I would then like to be able to use this virtual microphone with any application that supports choosing your microphone input pretty much any well written software as a valid microphone. So what the application hears will be my processed version of the microphone input.p  pIm working with Portaudio in C and I can capture from the mic, process, and send out to the speakers just fine. Now I need to replace my real speakers in the application with the phony microphone.

Negative 61387 pAt my last firm, I came across what seemed like a really clever way of creating constants for the indices of certain pieces of a delimited string, or columns in a SQL table, but Ive long wondered if theres a performance or other flaw I didnt catch.p  pFor example, if there were five data fields in a single delimited string containing address information, you might see the followingp  precodeconst int INDXNAME  0 const int INDXADDR  INDXNAME  1 const int INDXCITY  INDXADDR  1 const int INDXSTATE  INDXCITY  1 const int INDXZIP  INDXSTATE  1 codepre  pThat way, if in the future, the program needed to separate what could be two lines of an address between the name and city say, street address on one line, suite number on the other, all the programmer would have to do is add the line p  precodeconst int INDXADDR2  INDXADDR  1 codepre  pand change the line creating INDXCITY top  precodeconst int INDXCITY  INDXADDR2  1 codepre  pIn short, this seemed like a really clever way of handling columnpiece index lists that could change, especially if the list was 50 items, and you need to add something at index number 3.  However, I wasnt sure how much this could start affecting performance as the list starts getting large, or whether there was some other inherent flaw I wasnt seeing.p  pAny thoughts  Is there something that makes this lazy programming instead of cleverp  pThanks.p  pEDIT p  pI can see where the value of enums would be given the responses Ive been getting, but Im concerned that theyd only be useful if every field Im using is exactly 1 spot away from every other.  What if Im using pieces of some data storage that other programmers are also referencing, but I only care about a subset of the total fields, so I need to skip blocks of fields that I dont care about.  p  pFor example, Im using 100 data fields from a delimited string that 300fields long, but my application doesnt care about fields 14 array counting.

Negative 61387 pstrongIn shortstrong I want to do an XML Bulk Load to a SQL Server 2008 database and generate autoincrementids for a parent, that can be used in the child.  This seems limited by the scope the parentnode is not finished, so not inserted yet.  Does anybody know a way around thisp  pstrongThe longer descriptionstrong sorry, its really long, but I try to be completep  pFrom a customer I got a lot of XMLdocuments with a similar structure from which to generate a testDB. They are exported for use by another tool, my customer does not have authority nor contacts to influence the structure nor the contents.  The tools were written by another party for the mothercompany.  Nor does he have a formal description of the XML or the database they are exported from.  p  pIt turns out that the top XMLnodes codeltRegistrationgtcode do have IDs, but that these are not unique across documents.  Top nodes is relative, they do have a root node and a listnode, but in the XML they are the highest element that will make it to the database.  The IDs may be used in other XMLdocuments, because they refer to another object codeltCasegtcode that is not in the export.  So I need to generate autoincrementids to keep all codeltRegistrationgtcodeelements unique even across files.p  pMy codeltRegistrationgtcodenode has many daughters, e.g. the codeltActivitygtcodenode.  These nodes need to refer to their parent, so they should use the generated autoincrementid.  However, since they are part of an unfinished parentnode, the parentnode is still in scope, and it is not inserted in the table yet, as explained in Record Subset and the Key Ordering Rule on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms17263328vsql.11029.aspx relnofollowmsdna and a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryms172633.aspx relnofollowtechneta.  However, the examples on these sites have an explicit unique codeCustomerIdcode, not an autogenerated Id. p  pAlthough this documentation about the Key Ordering Rule makes it look like this can not be done, I can not believe there is no way around this for XMLfiles lacking unique IDs.  Even stranger is it does insert a parentid in the child, but the number is one lower.  So I assume this to be the autoincrementid from the previous scope where 0 is the default with nothing inserted yet, I  did expect a NULL.  So I do see one workaround increment the parentkey in my childtable afterwards codeUPDATE Activity SET RegistrationId  RegistrationId  1code.  However, this does require keeping a limit codeWHERE TimeStamp gt ...code and no other manual or scripting interventions.p  pI have tried a lot of different relationsships and VBscripts e.g. I would prefer autogeneration of my tables, but Ill just post my latest attempt.  This will also serve to illustrate the insertion of the autoincrementid from the previous scope.p  pMy main issue isp  ul liis it possible to get the right autoincremented parentidli ul  pBut other tips are very welcome, likep  ul liwhat setting to use to autogenerate the autoincrement identity without an explicit codeCREATE TABLEcodestatement in SQLli ul  pGenerate the tablesp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Registration]   [Id] INT IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL CONSTRAINT PKRegistration PRIMARY KEY,   [XmlId] [nvarchar]40 NULL,  CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Activity]   [Id] INT IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL CONSTRAINT PKActivity PRIMARY KEY,   [RegistrationId] INT CONSTRAINT FKActivityRegistration FOREIGN KEY RegistrationId REFERENCES Registration Id,   [XmlId] [nvarchar]1000 NULL,  codepre  pThe XMLfile to importp  precodeltUpdatesgt   ltRegistrationsgt     ltRegistration IDNonUniqCaseId123gt       ltActivitiesgt         ltActivity IDUniqActId1234 gt         ltActivity IDUniqActId1235 gt       ltActivitiesgt     ltRegistrationgt     ltRegistration IDNonUniqCaseId124gt       ltActivitiesgt         ltActivity IDUniqActId1241 gt         ltActivity IDUniqActId1242 gt       ltActivitiesgt     ltRegistrationgt   ltRegistrationsgt ltUpdatesgt codepre  pThe VBscript to test the upload I want to include a loop in a program later, to handle multiple filesp  precode    Dim objBL  Set objBL  CreateObjectSQLXMLBulkLoad.SQLXMLBulkload.4.0 objBL.ConnectionString  providerSQLOLEDBdata sourcelocalhostdatabaseTestintegrated securitySSPI objBL.ErrorLogFile  error.log  objBL.CheckConstraints  False objBL.XMLFragment  False objBL.SchemaGen  True objBL.SGDropTables  False objBL.KeepIdentity  False  objBL.Execute BulkTestMapping.xsd, BulkTestContents.xml Set objBL  Nothing codepre  pThe XSDp  precodeltxsschema xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema     xmlnsmsdataurnschemasmicrosoftcomxmlmsdata     attributeFormDefaultqualified     elementFormDefaultqualified     xmlnssqlurnschemasmicrosoftcommappingschemagt    ltxsannotationgt     ltxsappinfogt       ltsqlrelationship nameRegistrationActivity             parentRegistration             parentkeyId             childActivity             childkeyRegistrationId             inversetrue             gt     ltxsappinfogt   ltxsannotationgt    ltxselement nameRegistration               sqlrelationRegistration               sqlkeyfieldsId              gt     ltxscomplexTypegt       ltxssequencegt         ltxselement nameActivities minOccurs0 maxOccursunbounded sqlisconstanttruegt           ltxscomplexTypegt             ltxssequencegt               ltxselement nameActivity minOccurs0 maxOccursunbounded                      sqlrelationActivity                       sqlkeyfieldsRegistrationId                      sqlrelationshipRegistrationActivity               gt                 ltxscomplexTypegt                   ltxsattribute nameID sqlfieldXmlId formunqualified typexsstring gt                   ltxsattribute nameDbId sqlidentityignore sqlfieldId msdataAutoIncrementtrue msdataReadOnlytrue typexsint gt                  ltxscomplexTypegt               ltxselementgt             ltxssequencegt           ltxscomplexTypegt         ltxselementgt       ltxssequencegt       ltxsattribute nameID formunqualified sqlfieldXmlId gt       ltxsattribute nameDbId sqlidentityignore sqlfieldId msdataAutoIncrementtrue typexsint gt      ltxscomplexTypegt   ltxselementgt ltxsschemagt codepre  pThe resulting tables note that codeRegistrationIdcode is off by onep  precode[Registration] Id  XmlId 1   NonUniqCaseId123 2   NonUniqCaseId124  [Activity] Id  RegistrationId  XmlId 1   0   UniqActId1234 2   0   UniqActId1235 3   1   UniqActId1241 4   1   UniqActId1242 codepre  pstrongEditstrong It is even worse than I thought.

Negative 61387 pCalling virtual methods in C is prohibited, however there are a few situations, where it might be very useful.p  pConsider the following situation  pair of Parent and Child classes. Parent constructor requires a Child class to be instantiated, because it has to initialize it in a special way. Both Parent and Child may be derived, such that DerivedParent uses DerivedChild.p  pTheres a problem, however  because in Parentctor call from DerivedParentctor, base class should have an instance of DerivedChild instead of Child. But that would require calling a virtual method some way, what is prohibited. Im talking about something like thisp  precodeclass Child    public     virtual stdstring ToString  return Child    class DerivedChild  public Child   public     stdstring ToString  return DerivedChild    class Parent  protected     Child  child      virtual Child  CreateChild  return new Child   public     Parent  child  CreateChild      Child  GetChild  return child    class DerivedParent  public Parent  protected     Child  CreateChild  return new DerivedChild    int mainint argc, char  argv[]      DerivedParent parent      printfsn, parent.GetChildgtToString.cstr      getchar     return 0  codepre  pLets get a realworld example. Suppose, that I want to write wrapper for WinApis windows. The base Control class should register class and instantiate a window eg. RegisterClassEx and CreateWindowEx, to properly set it up for example register class in such way, that window structure has additional data for class instance set up generic WndProc for all Controls put reference to codethiscode by SetWindowLongPtr etc. p  pOn the other hand, derived class should be able to specify styles and extended styles, class name for window etc.p  pIf constructing instance of window in the Controls constructor is a contract to be fulfilled, I see no other solution than to use VMs in ctor what wont work.p  pPossible workaroundsp  ul liUse static polymorphism eg. class Derived  public Base, but it will not work, if one wants to derive from Derivedli liPass a lambda from derived to base ctor if it is possible  it will work, but its a total hardcore solutionli liPass a ton of parameters from derived to base ctor  it shall work, but wont be neither elegant, nor easy to use.li ul  pI personally dont like neither of them. Out of curiosity, I checked, how the problem is solved in Delphis VCL, and you know what, base class calls CreateParams, which is virtual Delphi allows such calls and guarantees, that they are safe  class fields are initialized to 0 upon creating.p  pHow can one overcome this language restrictionp  hr   pbEditb In response to answersp  blockquote   pCall CreateChild from the derived constructor. Youre already requiring CreateChild to be defined, so this is an incremental step. You can add a protected void init function in the base class to keep such initialization encapsulated.p blockquote  pIt will work, but its not an option  quoting the famous C FAQp  blockquote   pThe first variation is simplest initially, though the code that actually wants to create objects requires a tiny bit of programmer selfdiscipline, which in practice means youre doomed. Seriously, if there are only one or two places that actually create objects of this hierarchy, the programmer selfdiscipline is quite localized and shouldnt cause problems.p      pUse CRTP. Make the base class a template, have the child supply the DerivedType, and call the constructor that way. This kind of design can sometimes eliminate virtual functions completely.p blockquote  pIts not an option, because it will work only once, for base class and its immediate descendant.p  blockquote   pMake the child pointer a constructor argument, for example to a factory function.p blockquote  pThis is, so far, the best solution  injecting code into base ctor. In my case, I wont even need to do it, because I can just parametrize base ctor and pass values from the descendant. But it will actually work. p  blockquote   pUse a factory function template to generate the child pointer of the appropriate type before returning a parent. This eliminates the complexity of a class template. Use a type traits pattern to group child and parent classes.p blockquote  pYea, but it has some drawbacksp  ul liSomeone, who derives from my classes may publish his ctor and bypass the security measuresli liIt would prevent one from using references, one would have to use smart pointers.li ul

Negative 61387 pIm looking for some clarification on views in Ember.jsp  pComing from a rails background and Im trying to ignore any preconceptions. From what I understand of the ember framework there are 5 componentsp  ul liRoutes This is where we define the state of the application. The state is reflected in the URL. We can also define data loading here. Route classes are defined and on startup ember creates route objects which last for the duration of the application.li liModels This is where object data is defined. Can also define computed properties. A model object is created for each json object returned from the server.li liControllers This mediates interactions between the models and templatesviews. Controller classes are defined and on startup ember creates controller objects which last for the duration of the application. There is only ever a single instance of each controller class.li liTemplates These describe the generated markup.li liViews These are specific templates or dom elements relating to a model. These are used to define interface events and send them to the controller for handling. Not sure when to create these.li ul  pAs an example lets say I have a EventsController that has data loaded on the applicationRoutep  precodeScheduleApp.EventsController  Ember.ArrayController.extend  ScheduleApp.ApplicationRoute  Ember.Route.extend   setupController function      this.controllerForevents.setcontent, ScheduleApp.Event.find     codepre  pNow in my template instead of iterating over each and displaying the information I want to iterate over each and create an associated view so I can add interactions to each event. I presume I would need to create a new view for each event and have it display in my template. However, Im not sure where I create these views. Do I define a view class and then ember will create a new view object each time I call it using the view helper Eventually I would like to use the appendTo on the view to inject my events to different places in the dom. Where would this be definedp  pIve tried reading over the ember.js guide for views but it describes the context of a creating a single view. I think I want to make many views for each event and then dynamically interact with those objects.p  pUp to now ember has been outrageously clever so I would assume there is a built in method for generating these views. After all, most user interfaces are full of lists that require interactions. The problem is the list Im trying to make I then want to spread over the dom depending on its attributes.p

Negative 61387 pIn the Collection framework tutorials for the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialcollectionsinterfaceslist.html relnofollowList interfacea, there is an interesting quote regarding performance of removal of elements from a List implementation p  blockquote   pFor many common List implementations, such as ArrayList, the performance of removing elements from the end of the list is emsubstantiallyem better than that of removing elements from the beginning.p blockquote  pThe tutorials do not go further into explaining this and I am trying to understand exactly why it might be so.p  pConsidering an codeArrayListltIntegergt listcode as belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGa175.jpg altListp  pIn the first scenario, if we remove the last 4 elements from the end of the codelistcode, then the values of these are set to codenullcode or equivalent. My theory is that, when a copy operation is necessary, only the elements that are not codenullcode will be copied.p  pIn the second scenario, if we remove the first 4 elements, they would be set to codenullcode again and again only noncodenullcode elements would be copied. p  pSo from this point of view, the performances appear to be around the same. Is there another reason why the operation is faster if performed from the endp  pOn the other hand, for codeLinkedListcode, the inverse appears to be true removal from the beginning is faster, whereas removal from the end requires an almost full traversal unless a codetailpointercode  is kept.p

Since es are the most common letter in English, the program is trying to set the highest frequency char in the cipher, to an e in English. Which is good, as far as it goes, but there are many phrases where es are NOT the most frequent letter, and then it will fall on its face. p  pSo, how can I tell the program to guess at the most frequent cipher letter to be an e in plain text BUT in case it isnt, then proceed to try an e shifted to the second most frequent letter in the text, and so on, until I find it p  pA friend helped with that part but has poor English so it is difficult for him to explain it to me.

Negative 61387 pI use the action bar origin android, not ABS and position my views relatively on the root layout codeRelativeLayoutcode.

Negative 61387 pIm having difficulty getting the Chipmunk physics engine to do what I want. The only solution that appears to work requires some heavy vector math.

Negative 61387 pIm on the dev team for a socket server which uses Netty.  When a client sends a request, and the server sends a single response, the round trip time is quite fast. GOOD  We recently noticed that if the request from the client triggers two messages from the server, even though the server writes both messages to the client at about the same time, there is a delay of more than 200ms between the first and second message arriving on the remote client.  When using a local client the two messages arrive at the same time.  If the remote client sends another request before the second message from the server arrives, that second message is sent immediately, but then the two messages from the new request are both sent with the delay of over 200ms.p  pSince it was noticed while using Netty 3.3.1, I tried upgrading to Netty 3.6.5 but I still see the same behavior.  We are using NIO, not OIO, because we need to be able to support large numbers of concurrent clients.p  pIs there a setting that we need to configure that will reduce that 200 ms delay  p  pediting to add a code snippet.

Negative 61387 pstrongShort questionstrong anyone has detailed information on RemainingScripts parameter of ForEachObjectp  pstrongLong questionstrongp  pI just started learning PowerShell from last week and Im going through each Cmdlets to learn more details. Based on public documentation, we know ForEachObject can have BeginProcessEnd blocks, like thisp  precodeGetChildItem  foreach Begin  block1     fileCount  directoryCount  0 Process  block2     if .PsIsContainer directoryCount else fileCount End      block3 directoryCount directories and fileCount files codepre  pResult is expected 1 time for block1 and block3, block2 is repeated for each item passed in, and dir countfile count are all correct. So far so good.p  pNow, whats interesting is, the following command also works and gives exactly the same resultp  precodeGetChildItem  foreach  block1     fileCount  directoryCount  0 block2     if .PsIsContainer directoryCount else fileCount     block3 directoryCount directories and fileCount files codepre  pJust 3 ScriptBlocks passed to foreach. Based on manual, the first one goes to Process Position 1. But how about the remaining 2 According to manual, theres not a parameter with Position 2. So I turned to TraceCommand, and found that the later 2 script blocks were actually to RemainingScripts as IList with 2 elements.p  precodeBIND arg [fileCount  directoryCount  0] to parameter [Process] BIND arg [System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock[]] to param [Process] SUCCESSFUL BIND arg [System.Collections.ArrayList] to parameter [RemainingScripts] BIND arg [System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock[]] to param [RemainingScripts] SUCCESSFUL codepre  pSo If I change the command to thisp  precode No difference withwithout the comma , between the last 2 blocks GetChildItem  foreach Process  block1     fileCount  directoryCount  0 RemainingScripts  block2     if .PsIsContainer directoryCount else fileCount,     block3 directoryCount directories and fileCount files codepre  pStill, exactly the same result.p  pSo as you noticed, all 3 commands give the same result. This raises the interesting question both of the later two commands implicitly specified Process, however strongForEachObject surprisingly ends up using the argument of Process as Beginstrong script block is executed once at the beginning.p  pThis experimentation suggestsp  ol liRemainingScripts parameter will take all unbound ScriptBlocksli liWhen 3 blocks are passed in, although the first one goes to Process, later it is actually used as Begin while the remaining 2 become Process and Endli ol  pStill, all above are just my wild guess.

Negative 61387 pthis question was asked a year ago, but I have a specific question about onlineoffline syncing.p  pDevice A amp B are both offline, and you make independent changes to the model, lets say you connect device A first, so those changes sync to the cloud.p  pNow you connect device B, now those changes need to be merged with the changes existing on the cloud not simply replace the cloud, because they have changes as wellp  pDoes iCloud take care of thisp

Negative 61387 pSo, Im experimenting a bit with secure python programming if there is such a thing D. This is half a real world project, and half just a training exercise.

AND if so, how hard is it 12 seconds on a PC, or 20 years on a Crayp  pMy understanding from the entire point of AES is, no you cant. But Im just not that familiar. p  hr  pIm using an insignificantly modified version of the script here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6425131encrpytdecryptdatainpythonwithsaltEncrpyt  decrypt data in python with saltap  pBasically, it uses the salt to encrypt data. salt is a string, and data comes out as a string of encrypted characters. p  pUsing decrypt, with the same salt string, returns the data to normal text. p
Negative 61387 pImagine a table that has a codeJobIDcode and a codeSubJobIDcode.p  pThe combination of codeJobID  SubJobIDcode make the row unique.p  pFor instancep  precodeJobID  CAX100 SubJobID  CA00  JobID  CAX200RW SubJobID  CA00  JobID  CAX200YYXZ SubJobID  CA01  etc... codepre  pThese are valid rows, but if I try to again insert codeJobIDCAX100code and codeSubJobIDCA00code then this is not allowed and should error.p  pSo currently should I keep codeJobIDcode and codeSubJobIDcode the combination of both as a primary key  Or should I introduce an int as a primary key maybe an autoincrement int I know ints are better and smaller for primary keys, but then how do I ensure the uniqueness of codeJobID  SubJobIDcode if I introduce a number as a primary keyp  pCurrently I have codeJobIDcode and codeSubJobIDcode as composite primary keys I understand that, that is what I currently have, but what is recommended having both columns as pk varchar or introduce a new column int type with auto number and create a unique constraint on codeJobID  SubJobIDcodep

Negative 61387 pIm trying to do a rather complex Criteria query in a project.p  pThis particular example consists of 2 Database Tables ORDER and PAYMENT. The ORDER Table has a field i.e. an embedded Hibernate Entity called Money consisting of a property amount and an enum value for the currency containing the total price of the order.p  pThe PAYMENT table also has an amount column that contains the amount the customer has paid.  Each order contains the order total price and a payment. An order doesnt have to have a payment, so the payment property can be null. The hibernate mapping itself works.p  pIn my DAO I have a Criteria for the Order object object already containing some Restrictions. What I need to do now is to query for all Orders with a total order price between 2 values. This would look something likep  precodecriteria.addRestrictions.andRestrictions.georderTotalPrice.amount, amountFrom,                     Restrictions.leorderTotalPrice.amount, amountTo codepre  pAdditionally, I need to get all Orders containing a payment with a payment amount between the same two values. If the paymentAmount would be a property of the Order entity, We could to something like thisp  precodecriteria.addRestrictions.or                     Restrictions.andRestrictions.georderTotalPrice.amount, amountTo,                         Restrictions.leorderTotalPrice.amount, amountFrom,                     Restrictions.andRestrictions.gepaymentAmount.amount, amountFrom,                         Restrictions.lepaymentAmount.amount, amountTo codepre  pMy problem is, that the payment amount only exists inside a payment object inside the order entity. So to get the payment amount of an order, I would need something like payment.paymentAmount.amount. This doesnt work of course, so usually Id create a sub criteria like thisp  precode criteria.createCriteriapayment.add                     Restrictions.andRestrictions.gepaymentAmount.amount, amountFrom,                         Restrictions.lepaymentAmount.amount, amountTo codepre  pAdding the above example and the first example to the criteria means that the amounts have to be the same for the order price and the payment amount. What I would need is an OR between those two Restrictions.p  pSo my question is Is it supported by the Criteria API to add a Criterion to a criteria object to represent an OR between another Criterion and a sub criteriap  pI hope It is clear what my problem is. If anyone needs more information, dont hesitate to add a commentp  pThanks in advancep  pPS These are the simplified hibernate entity classesp  precodeEntity public class Order       Embedded     private Money orderTotalPrice      OneToOneoptional  true     private Payment payment       Getters amp Setters    Entity public class Payment       Embedded     private Money paymentAmount       Getters amp Setters    Embeddable public class Money      Column     private BigDecimal amount       Getters amp Setters  codepre

Negative 61387 pI want to render a yuv image on an iOS device. I presume it can be achieved using openGL. Actually I have to render multiple such images in successionp  pWhat I understand is that GLKit is an abstraction that iOS created, in which there is a codeGLKViewcode which will have and handle the render buffer. I am currently trying to use a codeGLKViewControllercode and frame update is being done successfully with desired fps. This I conform by using codeglClearcode function call.p  pNow the task is to render an image on the view.p  pThere is a class codeGLKBaseEffectcode which will have basic shaders. I cant figure out what properties to set, so I just create it and call codeprepareToDrawcode before each render.p  pThere is a class for handling textures, codeGLKTextureLoadercode, but it appears to me that it only works with Quartz images, i.e., yuv420 planar cant be loaded into the texture using this class.p  precode create the texture GLuint texture glGenTextures1, amptexture glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, texture glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA8,  width, height, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, [imageNSData bytes] glFramebufferTexture2DGLFRAMEBUFFER, GLCOLORATTACHMENT0, GLTEXTURE2D, texture, 0   codepre  pI use this code for generating a texture and binding it, but I dont really know what I am trying to do here. And whatever it is, it doesnt bring up any image on screen, and I dont know what to do next.p  pI have not created any shaders, assuming baseEffect will have something.p  pAnd this a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideWorkingwithEAGLContextsWorkingwithEAGLContexts.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40008793CH103SW8 relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideWorkingwithEAGLContextsWorkingwithEAGLContexts.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40008793CH103SW8a tells me that Ill have to use EAGLayer to render images on screen.p  pCan I use GLKit to render images If YES, do we have any sample code or tutorial that wouldnt use codeGLKTextureLoadercode class I couldnt find any If NO, is there a similar tutorial for render using codeEAGLLayercode I have not explored about it till now p

Negative 61387 pI know there are 1000 articles out there with issues like this, but they dont seem to be solving my issues.  I am working on a site that was created well before my arrival here at this company, and they basically have a placeholder to add widgets to a site.

It displays the AddWidgetContainer div just fine, but not the div elements inside.  Here is the code.  There is no external css since they are doing everything inline because the image is different for every user.

Negative 61387 pIm trying to upgrade a system thats using Spring 3.2 and Jersey from Jersey version 1.17 to Jersey version 2.4.  Im running into an annoying problem with Autowired where Jersey basically complains it cannot find the bean for a given generic type.p  pWe have a base class codeBaseServiceltTgtcode for databasebacked services that provides a basic CRUDstyle interface get, save, delete.  We also have a base class for the REST resources that looks similar to thisp  precodepublic abstract class BaseResourceltS extends BaseServiceltTgtgt      protected S service       ... common functions used by BaseService descendants ...      Autowired     public void setBaseServiceS baseService              this.service  baseService       codepre  pAnd then we have a number of concrete classes that inherit from codeBaseResourcecode, provide their unique logic, etc.  Under Jersey 1.17 this works fine.p  pAfter upgrading my environment to Jersey 2.4 and including the jerseyspring3 project, I get different behavior.  During service startup I can verify that the codesetBaseServicecode routine gets called by Spring and the supplied parameter is not null.  However when a client makes a call and an actual REST resource is executed, Jersey logs the following warningp  precodeorg.glassfish.jersey.server.spring.AutowiredInjectResolver getBeanFromSpringContext WARNING No beans found. Resolution failed for type S. codepre  pThis actually results in Jersey passing a null parameter to the codesetBaseServicecode routine, which of course causes NPEs.  Now I can work around the null parameter with a check, but Id like to know why Jersey is having this problem and how I can avoid it.p  pInteresting fact is that I have another REST resource that does not inherit from codeBaseResourcecode but does contain its own codeAutowiredcode codesetServicecode routine.  This one works perfectly fine it gets called correctly by Spring at startup and correctly by Jersey with a nonnull parameter upon each call.  Its just the genericbased setter that has the problem.p  pAnyone have any ideas  Thanks.p

Negative 61387 pI think I understand this correctly, but I just want to double check to be sure.  Suppose I write a binary file using VBA where the first X number of bytes represents some field, the next x number another field, and so on.

Is it reasonable to assume that the first x elements in the byte array directly correlate to the first x bytes in the file  p  pI should have made this clear from the getgo, the format and header of the file isnt all that important, Im just trying to get more into the nittygritty of reading and writing binary files and using byte arrays with vba.

Negative 61387 pI have made an application that uses an ObjectStream to send data to and from a server. When I was connecting to localhost, all worked wonderfully. However, when I created an actual server, the process takes almost 500ms to complete.p  pI would assume that my objects are too large.

I cannot fathom why the object is so large that it takes almost a half of a second to be sent over the server.p  pCan anyone tell me why this is happening Are Arraylists by nature large objects, and I should be using an Array instead I know it isnt the Serialization that is taking a long time, because when sending the Paintables over localhost, they were sent and then loaded in lt1ms.p  pIf there is any other information you need to determine the issue, please let me know.

I also have code that determines how long it takes to read the Command from the client very small Object, and that takes exactly 200ms. It then takes the client exactly 400ms to read the Paintables from the server.p  pEDIT 4p  pSolved by calling socket.setTcpNoDelaytrue on both the client socket and the socket created in the server thread. Works like a charm at 60 fpsp

Negative 61387 pAs an iOS noob, I recently starting feeling pretty good about myself when my iOS productivity started looking good. Until... I tried to figure out how to combine a UITabBarController with MMDrawerController in a storyboard p  pThe app shows three tabs permanently along the bottom, and I want to add a rightside sliding menu to that, and ideally I want to do this in storyboard. I settled on MMDrawerController for the sliding menu.p  pQuestion 1 strongIs it even empossibleem to point the first tab of the UITabBarController to a MMDrawerControllerstrong Or should it be the other way around set up the MMDrawerController at the root, and have the center view be the tabbed screenp  pFor example, UITabBarController has to be the root view of the application. So, I tried setting up the MMDrawerController for the view of the first tab as thats where I need it only anyway, but I was just not able to get it to work at all. All examples of how to integrate MMDrawerController into your project that I could find online, all set up the MMDrawerController at the root. To set up a tabbed screen as a sub view, it looks like you cant use UITabBarController, but need to mimic that yourself with UITabBar and regular UIViewControllersp  pQuestion 2 strongHas anyone seen any examples or tutorials that combine a tabbed interface with the side sliding menustrongp  pThe UI used in the Facebook iPhone app is essentially what Im trying to employ here you can drag the side sliding menu and as you do that it pushes out the main view along with its fixed tabs at the bottom.p  pIm totally overwhelmed and confused. I have no idea how to attack this.  It also doesnt help that Im totally new at Storyboards p  pAny help, or just pointers are super appreciated...p  pThanks, Erikp
Negative 61387 pI have a codeUITableViewControllercode with a codeUIViewcode at the bottom. using storyboard. My codeUIViewcode is set to hidden and changes state afterwards  on click of button. First, I was trying to resize increase height basically my UIView on codeIBActioncodebuttonClick using codeself.concluidoView.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 320, 50code but UIView was disappearing instead.p  pNow, it is correctly expanding codeUIViewcode with the following code inside codeIBActioncodep  precode[UIView animateWithDuration1.0                      animations                          CGRect frame  self.concluidoView.frame                          frame.size.height  100.0                          self.concluidoView.frame  frame                                             completionBOOL finished                           complete                       ] codepre  pThe problem is that my UITableViewController is not scrolling enough to the new size, since the codeUIViewcode is the last item in my codetableViewcode. p  pIve tried a few things to solve this problem, including manually trying to resize codetableviewcode to increase its height to the same value of the codeUIViewcodeincrease. I used the following codep  precodeCGRect tableFrame  self.tableview.frame         tableFrame.size.height  100         self.tableView.frame  tableFrame         [self.tableview layoutIfNeeded] codepre  pThe scrolling capacity of my codetableviewcodewas actually smaller after this code. I would like to resize codetableviewcodeand allow scrolling, either manually, since I know how much my codesubviewcodewill increase, or automatically.  p
Negative 61387 pI am using Eclipse, Kepler version.p  pHow do I disable the spell checking inside commentsp  pI do see Window  Preferences  General  Editors  Text Editors  Spelling, but this sheet has no option about disabling spell checking inside comments.p  pIdeally, I would like to disable spell checking for a specific comment.p  pIn other places spell checking comments can be useful.p  pUPDATE Whoever gave the down vote, please clarify the reason, otherwise I do not learn.p  pAdditionally, I did see the other referenced solution, which I am using and did use, but I did not want to disable spell checking for good. I wanted to turn off spell checking in certain situations but leave it on for others. That was addressed in a comment, so if the negative vote was because my question was addressed elsewhere, then it was not.p

Negative 61387 pI am working with Javascript and based of a radio select it changes the fields in a form. The fields are generated with the Javascript. That part is operating very nicely however one of the fields is also a date that I am trying to use the jQueryUI datepicker with. For some reason it is not running the Javascript on a Javascript created field. Im not sure if it is my order the scripts are in or what but any help would be appreciated. Here is a JSFiddle with the code I am using. It isnt running because I dont have all of the dependencies linked but you get an overview of how I have it set up. I can put more time putting in the dependencies if you feel its needed or a link to my page.p  pemem I was playing around with it and noticed that when I initially click on the date select it doesnt do anything but when I click another field and go back to it, it then worksp  pRight now I am focusing on the field that becomes available in the javascript when Pick up is selected which is on line 22 of the Javascript.p  pThanks guysp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethn9Qe relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethn9Qeap  pJavascriptp  precodefunction showx    var elementdocument.getElementByIdx.id   ifelement.ida            var table  document.getElementByIdmyTable         var length  table.rows.length         iflength gt 9                      var del1  table.deleteRow5             var del2  table.deleteRow5             var del3  table.deleteRow5                  var row  table.insertRow5         var cell1  row.insertCell0         var cell2  row.insertCell1         var row2  table.insertRow6         var cell3  row2.insertCell0         var cell4  row2.insertCell1         cell1.innerHTML  PickUp Date       For right now just focusing on getting this datepicker to properlly popup.         cell2.innerHTML  ltinput typetext namedatepicker iddatepicker onFocusdateSelectgt         cell3.innerHTML  PickUp Time         cell4.innerHTML  ltinput typetext nametxtTime idtxtTimegt      else             var table  document.getElementByIdmyTable         var length  table.rows.length         iflength gt 9                      var del1  table.deleteRow5             var del2  table.deleteRow5                  var row  table.insertRow5         var cell1  row.insertCell0         var cell2  row.insertCell1         var row2  table.insertRow6         var cell3  row2.insertCell0         var cell4  row2.insertCell1         var row3  table.insertRow7         var cell5  row3.insertCell0         var cell6  row3.insertCell1         cell1.innerHTML  Delivery Date         cell2.innerHTML  ltinput typetext nametxtDelDate idtxtDelDategt         cell3.innerHTML  Delivery Time         cell4.innerHTML  ltinput typetext nametxtDelTime idtxtDelTimegt         cell5.innerHTML  Delivery Address         cell6.innerHTML  ltinput typetext nametxtDelTime2 idtxtDelTime2gt        function dateSelect  function       datepicker .datepicker    codepre  pHTML Formp  precodeltform actioncateringSubmit methodpostgt lttable idmyTable width600 border0gt   lttrgt     lttdgtCompany Namelttdgt     lttdgtltspan idsprytextfield1gt       ltinput typetext namedatepicker2 iddatepicker2gt       ltspan classtextfieldRequiredMsggtA value is required.ltspangtltspangtlttdgt   lttrgt   lttrgt     lttdgtContact Namelttdgt     lttdgtltspan idsprytextfield2gt       ltinput typetext nametxtConName idtxtConNamegt       ltspan classtextfieldRequiredMsggtA value is required.ltspangtltspangtlttdgt   lttrgt   lttrgt     lttdgtContact Phone Numberlttdgt     lttdgtltspan idsprytextfield3gt       ltinput typetext nametxtPhone idtxtPhonegt       ltspan classtextfieldRequiredMsggtA value is required.ltspangtltspangtlttdgt   lttrgt   lttrgt   lttdgtEmail Addresslttdgt   lttdgtltspan idsprytextfield4gt     ltinput typetext nametxtEmail idtxtEmailgt     ltspan classtextfieldRequiredMsggtA value is required.ltspangtltspangtlttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt     lttdgtPickUp or Deliverylttdgt     lttdgtltinput nameradioButton typeradio ida onclickshowagtPickUp         ltinput typeradio onclickshowthis nameradioButton  idb gtDeliverylttdgt      lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgtOrderlttdgt          lttdgtlttextarea nametxtOrder cols30 rows10gtlttextareagtlttdgt    lttrgt            lttrgt               lttdgtSpecial Pricing if applicable lttdgt               lttdgtltinput nametxtPricing typetextgtlttdgt               lttrgt               lttrgt               lttdgtSpecial Requests lttdgt               lttdgtlttextarea nametxtRequests cols30 rows10gtlttextareagtlttdgt               lttrgt               lttrgt               lttd colspan2 aligncentergtltinput namebtnSubmit typesubmit valueSubmit gtlttdgt               lttrgt              lttablegt ltformgt ltpgt codepre

Negative 61387 pIm wondering if its more efficient to do a less than or equal to comparison in a loop or a less than comparison. Does the codeltcode operator instruct the computer to make two comparisons is it less than, is it equal to, or does it simplify it Take the following example. I want a loop than increments to 1000. Should I set the ceiling to 1001 and tell it that codewhile i is lt OR  1001, icode Or should I tell it that codewhile i lt 1000, icode Will the compiler GCC simplify it to the same basic instructionsp

Negative 61387 pI have a window into which I horizontally add two subviews. Into each subview, I place a variable number of subviews made up of a vertical slider, a text field rotated 90 degrees and placed to the left of the slider and another textfield, placed just under the slider. The slider subviews constraints are done in code, the parent views are both done in IB. When I add more slider views to the left window than the subview can handle in its default size, it resizes horizontally and forces the windows content view and window to also resize horizontally. Great, thats just what I want. But if I add more slider subviews than can fit in the right subview, they just get squeezed together and the subview does not expand as the left.

Negative 61387 pDo region and language selections in the Windows OS actually have a set of characters associated to themp  pWhen you use the CultureAndRegionalInfoBuilder class to register a new culture to the system, the only characters associated to your new culture that you can set are the native digits. I need to register an obscure language that uses UTF8 characters that dont exist in the languages that come packaged with Windows or in any of the language packs. Im uncertain about the internals of Windows culture definitions and whether or not a character set is stored with them. My assumption is that the culture definition does nothing more than let you specify the native digits and various formats used in that culture and give applications a mechanism for localization and formatting and that it really has nothing to do with a specified character set. Can someone tell me if my assumption here is correct.p

Negative 61387 pI have an iPhone application that makes a few web service calls. There are 2 calls to simple RSS feeds and then there are 2 calls made to an ASP.NET powered web service.p  pThe calls to the RSS feed work consistently in every scenario whether it is via wifi or 4g, and it also works for every carrier ATampT, Sprint, Verizon, etc....p  pThe 2 calls made to the ASP.NET web service will always work on wifi, but they will not work on 4g with every carrier. Specifically ATampT 4g LTE will fail on these calls immediately every single time whereas calls made by another carrier CSpire will succeed on 4g.p  pI want to clarify that iPhones using the same version of the app will succeed when requesting the ASP.NET calls via wifi, but will fail only when using ATampT 4g LTE. I have tested them myself with full bars full network service access immediately after visiting websites on 4g.p  pI do not have access to any error messages as I do not personally own an iPhone with ATampT as its carrier.p  pIve looked online and havent found any issues related to a specific carrier like this. Has anyone ever heard of this beforep  pEDIT I have not been able to test the iPhone app on a device with TMobile as the carrier, but I have learned that ATampT and TMobile use GSM while the other carriers use CDMA. Could this be a determining factorp
Negative 61387 pAs explained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3279550982107this answera, the copyandswap idiom is implemented as followsp  precodeclass MyClass  private     BigClass data     UnmovableClass dataPtr  public     MyClass        data, dataPtrnew UnmovableClass       MyClassconst MyClassamp other        dataother.data, dataPtrnew UnmovableClassother.dataPtr       MyClassMyClassampamp other        datastdmoveother.data, dataPtrother.dataPtr      other.dataPtr nullptr       MyClass  delete dataPtr       friend void swapMyClassamp first, MyClassamp second              using stdswap         swapfirst.data, other.data         swapfirst.dataPtr, other.dataPtr           MyClassamp operatorMyClass other              swapthis, other         return this       codepre  pBy having a value of MyClass as parameter for operator, the parameter can be constructed by either the copy constructor or the move constructor. You can then safely extract the data from the parameter. This prevents code duplication and assists in exception safety.p  pThe answer mentions you can either swap or move the variables in the temporary. It primarily discusses swapping. However, a swap, if not optimised by the compiler, involves three move operations, and in more complex cases does additional extra work. When all you want, is to emmoveem the temporary into the assignedto object.p  pConsider this more complex example, involving the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiObserverpattern relnofollowobserver patterna. In this example, Ive written the assignment operator code manually. Emphasis is on the move constructor, assignment operator and swap methodp  precodeclass MyClass  ObservableIObserver  private     stdsharedptrltObservablegt observable  public     MyClassstdsharedptrltObservablegt observable  observableobservable observablegtregisterObserverthis      MyClassconst MyClassamp other  observableother.observable  observable.registerObserverthis      MyClass  ifobservable  nullptr  observablegtunregisterObserverthis       MyClassMyClassampamp other  observablestdmoveother.observable              observablegtunregisterObserverother         other.observable.resetnullptr         observablegtregisterObserverthis           friend void swapMyClassamp first, MyClassamp second              Checks for nullptr and same observable omitted             using stdswap             swapfirst.observable, second.observable              second.observablegtunregisterObserverfirst             first.observablegtregisterObserverfirst             first.observablegtunregisterObserversecond             second.observablegtregisterObserversecond           MyClassamp operatorMyClass other              observablegtunregisterObserverthis         observable  stdmoveother.observable          observablegtunregisterObserverother         other.observable.resetnullptr         observablegtregisterObserverthis       codepre  pClearly, the duplicated part of the code in this manually written assignment operator is identical to that of the move constructor. You could perform a swap in the assignment operator and the behaviour would be right, but it would potentially perform more moves and perform an extra registration in the swap and unregistration in the destructor.p  pWouldnt it make much more sense to reuse the move constructors code in steadp  precodeprivate     void performMoveActionsMyClassampamp other              observablegtunregisterObserverother         other.observable.resetnullptr         observablegtregisterObserverthis       public     MyClassMyClassampamp other  observablestdmoveother.observable              performMoveActionsother           MyClassamp operatorMyClass other              observablegtunregisterObserverthis         observable  stdmoveother.observable          performMoveActionsother      codepre  pIt looks to me like this approach is never inferior to the swap approach. Am I right in thinking that the copyandswap idiom would be better off as the copyandmove idiom in C11, or did I miss something importantp

Negative 61387 pCurrenlty Im using SimpleIoC from MvvmLight and I cannot figure out how to supply the constructor parameters to a class that implements IMyService. Ive found the following SO thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8850106mvvmsimpleiochowtouseaninterfacewhentheinterfaceimplementationrequirMVVM SimpleIoc, how to use an interface when the interface implementation requires construction parametersa , and it suggests that I simply need to pass the constructor argument when registring the implemententation to the interface, e.g. p  precodeSimpleIoc.Default.RegisterltIMyServicegt gt    return new MyServiceImplementationHello World  codepre  pHowever, this registration is located in the ViewModelLocator class, which has now knowledge on the actual constructor parameter. Instead of being Hello world, it could be Hi there but that is not know at compile time. Is there any way to pass the constructor arguments at runtime p  pCurrently I only see two options 1 register IMyService in the viewmodel, or 2 remove the constructor parameter altogether and provide a property that needs to be set. Neither option seems right, so Id very much appreciate any suggestions on how to pass constructor arguments to MyServiceImplementation.p
Negative 61387 pI am having a problem binding data retrieved from the server to a drop down list.

Negative 61387 pI am new to brew and have been using it to great effect until now.  I am trying to install pygame, and it is not letting me get past one of the dependencies, codesdlttfcode.

The bottom line is that I have now downloaded and successfully installed the package myself but brew still keeps asking for it and failing.  p  pFrom my perspective I have installed the dependency, so brew should let me proceed in the first place.

One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.p  pTo solve this I decided to create a framework, so I added a framework, but I dont know how to make it so that a both the main app and bundle access the framework via the compiled framework, and not just through the headers in the project, and so the framework is compiled when I run the project.  p  pIf you know how to do this, thanksp

Negative 61387 pI have two sorted arrays of numbers. The first array is a set of n integers which are targets equally spaced between the bounds of the array. The second array has a large multiple of n integers and is also a set. I want to find the n integers from the second array which are closest to all targets in the first array, with the condition that only one integer from the second array can match any target from the first array. That is, all matches are mutually exclusive. p  pThanks for any helpp  pEditp  pSorry for lack of detail. This is a simplification of the real problem.p  pSimple first array example with regular targets [0x0,0x7FFFFFFF,0xFFFFFFFF]p  pThe second array is essentially random data without duplicates, uniformly distributed across the extents of the first array. That is, there might be 2000 integers between 0x0 and 0xFFFFFFFF. I need the three integers from the second array which are closest to the targets in the first array. In the real problem the targets will have smaller extents and more targets, always regularly spaced.p  pEdit More context.p  pA large array B is a stream of random 32 byte hashes which have been sorted and are being fitted into a nary tree. For each node there are known limits u and v. Array A is constructed by dividing u and v into n1 strides. For each subset of B which is between u and v, try and find the member of B which is closest to one of n1 strides. These selected members are then used to further filter B for each child node below. Its basically heuristics for balancing a tree containing random data. Deep nodes have a progressively smaller B to consider. A is always fixed length.p

Negative 61387 pI found differencies between browsers how they report computed style dimensions when browser window is zoomed. The JSBIN example is in a hrefhttpjsbin.compilohonevo2httpjsbin.compilohonevo2a. The code is as followsp  precodewindow.resizefunction    var width1.class1.csswidth   .class1.csswidth,width1    var width2200px   .class2.csswidth,width2    var width3.class3.csswidth    width1.htmlwidth1   width2.htmlwidth2   width3.htmlwidth3    overflow1.html.overflow1[0].scrollWidth   overflow2.html.overflow2[0].scrollWidth   overflow3.html.overflow3[0].scrollWidth  codepre  pWhen you zoom to minimum by pressing CMD few times and then back to 100 by pressing CMD few times, in Chrome Mac Version 38.0.2125.111, you get the following valuesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwkYrU.png altenter image description herep  pThe white DIV 1 reports its width as 203px, although DIV 2 and 3 reports 200px. Also scrollWidth is 203, which is wrong as well. This means that you cannot use codegetComputedStylecode or jQuerys code.csscode to get dimensions if you are not sure that browser window is not zoomed. And because zooming is not cancelable you can never be sure and you can never trust to those dimensions. I tested also codeelem.scrollLeftcode and codeelem.scrollTopcode and those are unreliable as well when zoomed.p  pSo a workaround can be to use raw values, not computed values.p  pbIs there a crossbrowser javascript or jQuery method to get something like codegetUnComputedStylecode which determines dimensions using raw values from stylesheets andor style attribute, because they are the only ones that are zoomsafebp  pDetermining zoom level and make corrections based on that is unreliable according to my tests, because there are browser differencies and error levels in different style properties are not consistently related to zoom level.p  pFirefox Mac 33.1 and Safari Mac version 7.1 9537.85.10.17.1 and IE 11 Win and emulated modes down to version 7 report correct values.p  pOpera Mac 25.0.1614.68, Safari Win 5.1.7 and the above reported Chrome report wrong values.p

Negative 61387 pWe have a number of Meters which read a number of Parameters at a given interval and uploads the data in CSV format to a MYSQL database.p  pI have modelled this in Rails as followsp  precodeMeter   hasmany parameters  Parameter   belongsto meter   hasmany readings  Reading   belongsto parameter codepre  pIve used normal foreign keys  meterid and parameterid  to link the tablesp  pThis is working great with my seed data and Im using codeself.readings.pluckvalue.latestcode in my Parameter model in order to grab the latest value and pass it to the view.p  pThe only problem is that the meters upload the data every 30 seconds. This means that  as there are currently 20 parameters  just over a months worth of data has left me with over 20,000,000 rows in my Readings table and this means that the queries to grab the latest are taking around 500ms each.p  pIm after suggestions of ways to optimise this. Ive added an index to the parameterid field but, other than that, Im not really sure of the best way to proceed...p  pIt may be that I need to rethink the way that my database is structured, but this seemed to make most sense as I want to be able to dynamically add new parameters down the line hence why I couldnt just make my columns the parameter names and this seems to be the way that Rails stores data by default.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 61387 pI have a method that accepts a reference of an object as const, this method doesnt change anything of the method and the const indicates that, the thing is that this method also calls other method that is within the class and is void, doesnt accept any argument and is also virtual, meaning that the class that extends the base class can override the method BUT it needs to be const as well. Egp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  class Boz  public     virtual void introduce const  0   class Foo  public     virtual void callable const               ...           void callerconst Bozamp object const              callable         object.introduce        class Bar  public Boz  public     void introduce const              stdcout ltlt Hi. ltlt stdendl        class Biz  public Foo  public     void callable const              stdcout ltlt Im being called before the introduce. ltlt stdendl        int mainvoid      Biz biz     biz.callerBar      return 0  codepre  pThe output would bep  precodeIm being called before the introduce. Hi. codepre  pAs you can see codecallablecode must to be const in order to be called. If I change and do thisp  precodeclass Biz  public Foo  public     void callable              stdcout ltlt Im being called before the introduce. ltlt stdendl       codepre  pIt will compile not errors are thrown but the callable method wont be called, but the virtual one as its defined as const. Its quite obvious.p  pThe trickiest part herep  precodeclass Foo  public     virtual void callable               ...           void callerconst Bozamp object const              auto trick  [amp]   callable           trick          object.introduce        class Biz  public Foo  public     void callable              stdcout ltlt Im being called before the introduce. ltlt stdendl       codepre  pIt works and the codecallablecode method is called. No errors like codepassing const ... as this argumentcode.p  pWhat Im trying to do is to call codecallablecode without the need of being const and the reason is simple The method doesnt change anything, he dont have access to the object that is begin passed as argument on codecallercode method then we assume that he doesnt have the need to be codeconstcode but the compiler throws an error even that way. The real problem is that codecallablecode is virtual and classes can extend the base class, implement their own codecallablecode and try to call other methods but cant if its not codeconstcode as well.p  pWhat I want is pretty much that, is to know how can I call the virtual method without the need of being const the reason is pretty much that, Im kind forcing the users that extends the class and override the codecallablecode method to only call codeconstcode methods and this is not what I want and of course understand what happens with the lambda and why it works.p

Apparently  the differente configuration, JPA entitiestodatabase mapping is the only difference.p  pI know that this can be achieved by maintaining two JPA persistence.xml configuration files.

As far as I have heard, then the opposite approach is possible  to keep mapping in persistence.xml and use annotations for overriding.p

Negative 61387 pI have a .jar file which represents a wrapper to launch another .jar file with some arguments for the JVM, as apparently there is no other way to do it. This wrapper builds up the command line arguments codejava jar ltarg1gt ltarg2gt ... MyJarFile.jarcode based on the system architecture invoking the 64 bit JVM coded64code or not and setting the heap size via codeXmx1280Mcode max on a 32 bit system, from what I understood or asking for 4 GB if its a 64 bit architecture. Checking the Java version via codejava versioncode shows me that I have a 64 bit JVM running and checking the PATH in the environment variables confirms it. Now, everything is OK if I launch the wrapper via the command line. The actual .jar file is launched with an allocated 4GB of memory. If I double click the wrapper from Windows explorer, the actual .jar file is launched with the minimum e.g., 247 MB of memory. strongNotestrong that I have also set the codeXms512MBcode in the command arguments, which apparently is ignored if launching the wrapper from the Windows UI. It is true, that on the machines that I experience the problem, both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Java are installed. Checking the Windows registry regedit under local machinejarFile entry, I see that it is linked to the 32 bit version of the runtime environment. If I change it there, it works, but as soon as a java update is installed, the registry setting is reverted. Any ideas why this is happening I did not test on UNIX systems yet as the application is mainly used on Windows. Thank you.p

Negative 61387 pI have a windows form application that I am attempting to refactor  I have some functions and variables that I want to separate into other classes. When I do that, I cannot access the members of the codeMainClasscode, like the controls of the Windows Form. I could make them public static, but then I have issues with the designer. Example, in a codeNewClasscode function I refactored, I would reference a control likep  precodeMainClass.listBox1.Items.Clear codepre  pBut this wont work as the control is private. This gives the errorsp  precode1. An object reference is required for the nonstatic field, method, or property MainClass.listBox1 2 MainClass.listBox1 is inaccessible due to its protection level codepre  pSo, if I make codelistBox1code public static so my codeNewClasscode can access it, I get the following error everywhere codethis.listBox1code appears in the Designer.csp  precode1 Member MainClass.listBox1 cannot be accessed with an instance reference qualify it with a type name instead codepre  pSo my first thought is to change the this.listBox1 to MainClass.listBox1, but I think of the warning at the top of the Designer.cs pagep  precode Required method for Designer support  do not modify  the contents of this method with the code editor. codepre  pObviously these arent my real code samplesnames, but the errors are what Im getting and Ive replaced the names with appropriate names for the sake of generalization.

The student, a child prodigy, was Carl Gauss, who grew   up to be one of the most famous mathematicians of the eighteenth   century.

My Id is correct because if I add the fragment on the main activity and change the text from the fragment onCreate method the change text function works. What does not work is that I have a fragmentA that is added to my activity, I click on a button and count the number of time I click on it. Then I wanna change the Textview of my FragmentC to  the counter is equal to .. and ONLY then my textview is null. I suspect the reason for it to be null is that its not yet added to the activity.

Negative 61387 pIve been working on porting some existing game framework technology to Android and, consequently, Ive been working in OpenGL ES 2.0. I have set up a sprite batching class very similar to XNAs SpriteBatch. While the class works correctly when used with XNA, its producing odd results when used with my OpenGL framework. In short, its drawing the sprites in the right place and with the correct rotation, but whichever texture is drawn last is being used for every sprite.p  pSimply, if I instruct it to draw two instances of Texture A and then one instance of Texture B, then it will draw three instances of Texture B. If I reverse the order, it will draw three instances of Texture A. Whichever texture is sent last replaces the other textures. The obvious answer would be that I am replacing the texture in the required slot. However, I do not believe I am doing so though my knowledge of OpenGL is limited. In order to help diagnose the issue, I dispersed console output statements throughout my code base wherever a call to the OpenGL API was used excluding shader compilation, linking, etc. After running the code to a break point after the first frame, the output seems to suggest that the correct texture is assigned at each point.p  precodeGL Setting frontface direction to CCW.

GL Swapping Buffers. codepre  pThe log certainly seems to indicate that the correct texture was assigned at the time of each draw and attribute call. Unfortunately, this process touches on quite a lot of code. The texture, graphics, and sprite batching systems are clearly at the centre, but it also tangentially touches on the effect system. Ill try to avoid posting unnecessary code without removing anything that might prove important.p  pThe sprite renderer runs a setup before flushing. Any parameters that dont exist on the effect are ignored.p  precodeprivate void Setup      graphicsDevice.BlendState  blendState     graphicsDevice.SamplerState  samplerState      if effect.ApplyAfterParamters         effect.Apply0  Apply first pass if effect applied before parameters set.

Negative 61387 pIve a couple issues with a page Im working on.p  pI have two sections frmConf and frmData.p  pThe first one has some parameters I use for searching purposes.p  pThe second one has a DataTable defined as lazy and algo I have its corresponding backing wich extends LazyDatamodel.p  pIn the mentioned DataTable in section 2 I have a column with a commandLink which creates a PDF document for the selected row in the DataTable.p  pThe problem Im facing is it works just fine the first time I load the pagep  pIt calls the load override method from LazyDatamodel and presents the first 10 records of the query results from the DB. p  pThen, when I click on the commandLink column it shows the save as dialog for the corresponding PDF just fine and I can proceed to download the file.p  pBut then, for some reason wich I dont yet understand, if I click another rows PDF commandLink it goes and calls the referred load method a requeries the DB assuming Im trying to do some pagination and it doesnt even generate the required PDF. p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is just load the page for every pagination case and not for any unrelated event like clicking the PDF button for the selected row.p  pWhy is it reloading and requerying even though it shows the same results as the indexes for pagination havent change the entire page content after the first correctPDF generation  Its my guess something happens after the first PDF generation it leaves the page with some reload required state.p  pIm leaving the markup from the page as well as the corresponding backing bean PDF generation method. p  pPlease Id really appreciate if someone could help me with this.p  pThanksp  pJSF markupp  precode    ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN

Negative 61387 pI am building a project where I have two SQL tables codewikispyeditcode and codewikispyrdnscode. codewikispyeditcode contains  among other things  an codeipcode column with an index, which is the same data type as codeipcode column in codewikispy.rdnscode, which is a primary key there. The problem is that I cannot connect these two with codedjango.db.models.ForeignKeycode, because some of the codewikispyeditcode codeipcode values do not have a corresponding value in codewikispyrdnscode. While Django doesnt seem to complain during code.manage.py migratecode, it doesnt allow me to insert such objects using its ORM, which is annoying.p  pIs there a way I could model this relationship and still achieve the effect of codeEdit.objects.selectrelated.filterrdnsrdnssomequeryblahcode I need a similar syntax because this is the only I found that allows me to perform this query in a single SQL statement and this sometimes pulls thousands of objects.

When lineclamping links, Chrome tends to put the ellipses a bit sooner and end with the last portion of the link text.

Negative 61387 pI have a Django app being served with codenginxcodecodegunicorncode with 3 codegunicorncode worker processes.  Occasionally maybe once every 100 requests or so one of the worker processes gets into a state where it starts failing most but not all requests that it serves, and then it throws an exception when it tries to email me about it.  The codegunicorncode error logs look like thisp  precode[20150429 104139 0000] [20833] [ERROR] Error handling request Traceback most recent call last   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesgunicornworkerssync.py, line 130, in handle   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesgunicornworkerssync.py, line 171, in handlerequest   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangocorehandlerswsgi.py, line 206, in call   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangocorehandlersbase.py, line 196, in getresponse   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangocorehandlersbase.py, line 226, in handleuncaughtexception   File usrlibpython2.7logginginit.py, line 1178, in error   File usrlibpython2.7logginginit.py, line 1271, in log   File usrlibpython2.7logginginit.py, line 1281, in handle   File usrlibpython2.7logginginit.py, line 1321, in callHandlers   File usrlibpython2.7logginginit.py, line 749, in handle   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangoutilslog.py, line 122, in emit   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangoutilslog.py, line 125, in connection   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangocoremailinit.py, line 29, in getconnection   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangoutilsmoduleloading.py, line 26, in importbypath   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangoutilsmoduleloading.py, line 21, in importbypath   File homedjangovirtualenvshomesteaddjangolocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangoutilsimportlib.py, line 40, in importmodule ImproperlyConfigured Error importing module django.core.mail.backends.smtp No module named smtp codepre  pSo some uncaught exception is happening and then Django is trying to email me about it.  The fact that it cant import codedjango.core.mail.backends.smtpcode doesnt make sense because codedjango.core.mail.backends.smtpcode should definitely be on the worker process Python path.  I can import it just fine from a codemanage.py shellcode and I do get emails for other server errors actual software bugs so I know that works.  Its like the the worker process environment is corrupted somehow.p  pOnce a worker process enters this state it has a really hard time recovering almost every request it serves ends up failing in this same manner.  If I restart codegunicorncode everything is good until another worker process falls into this weird state again.p  pI dont notice any obvious patterns so I dont think this is being triggered by a bug in my app the URLs erroring out are different, etc.  It seems like some sort of race condition.p  pCurrently Im using codegunicorncodes codemaxrequestscode option to mitigate this problem but Id like to understand whats going on here.  Is this a race condition  How can I debug thisp

Negative 61387 pIm trying to build a complex SQL that would autoassign assignments to workers in a roundtable fashion. So for example, I have 50 workers and 500 assignments. I want each worker to get evenly 10 assignments, however they might not all get 10, some may get more because there are IF variables that may have 1 worker get 15 and 1 get 5. Here are the variables that make this SQL complex. I have 2 tables that this data is going to be pulling from and updating. tblUser is where all of the workers information is held, fields [programs] and [language] are the variables that we have to consider when we assign. Workers may only know 1 program, 2 programs, or 3 programs. It specifically says which program each employee knows. p  pFor example, worker 1 knows MCCF and that is placed in field [programs]. Now for [language] each worker may or may not know more than 1 language. If they do, it is listed in the [language] field. We assume all workers know english so lets take that into consideration. However english only workers should not get spanish assignments.p  pNow for the 2nd table, CFRRR this table is where the assignments are located. [assignedto] is the field that the worker who gets assigned the case has that workers [WorkerID] placed in. [workername] is the field that the worker who gets assigned the case has that workers [username] placed in. [language] is a field that has what language the assignment is in and [program] has what program the assignment is in. The complicated variable here is that [program] in CFRRR may only say MC, but a worker with MCCF can can the assignment because they have MC as one of their programs, so a match sql wouldnt work for that.p  pI have a roundtable SQL now, but it doesnt take into consideration any of the variables language, program which is really important in assigning. p  precodePublic Function GetNextAssignee As Long      Dim db As dao.Database     Dim rs As dao.Recordset     Dim strSQL As String      Set db  CurrentDb     strSQL  SELECT TOP 1 WorkerID FROM tblUser ORDER BY TS ASC     Set rs  db.OpenRecordsetstrSQL, dbOpenDynaset     If Not rs.BOF And Not rs.EOF Then         strSQL  UPDATE tblUser SET TS   amp DMax[TS], tblUser  1 amp  WHERE [WorkerID]  amp rsworkerid         db.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError         GetNextAssignee  rsworkerid     Else         GetNextAssignee  0     End If      rs.Close     db.Close     Set rs  Nothing     Set db  Nothing  End Function Public Function AssignNullProjects As Long      Dim db As dao.Database     Dim rs As dao.Recordset     Dim strSQL As String      Set db  CurrentDb     strSQL  SELECT CFRRRID FROM CFRRR WHERE assignedto Is Null     Set rs  db.OpenRecordsetstrSQL, dbOpenDynaset     If Not rs.BOF And Not rs.EOF Then         While Not rs.EOF             strSQL  UPDATE CFRRR SET assignedto   amp GetNextAssignee amp  WHERE CFRRRID   amp rsCFRRRID             db.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError             rs.MoveNext         Wend     End If      rs.Close     db.Close     Set rs  Nothing     Set db  Nothing End Function codepre

Negative 61387 pIve been checking out the documentation for Googles My Maps service, and I cant figure out if it will let me do what I need to do.p  pOur client has a map, created using My Maps, that defines several delivery areas using colored polygons. I understand that its possible to export a KML file containing the coordinates for these polygons, and that its also possible to create a network link so said KML file will be updated whenever the map is.p  pMy problem I dont know what to actually do with the KML file. I need some sort of script that can take the networklinked KML, and return a humanreadable set of coordinates that I can use to define delivery areas on the clients site. strongIn other words, they need to be able to edit or create delivery zones on this map, then on their site, bind each polygon to a particular store to determine which store must deliver which orders.strong Theres a lot of complicated stuff going on here, but for this first step I just need to know how to get the coordinates for the separate shapes in a reliable way.p  pI wish I had some code to post to make this a more useful post, but its more a question of whether or not this type of functionality is actually possible. Please help me figure this outp  pThanks for any and all help.p

Negative 61387 pI am attempting to write a generic messaging passing system for Delphi and .NET. The system allows messages to be defined as plain objects and message handlers are defined as anonymous methods that act on those objects.p  pThe objects are converted to JSON and passed between applications running on the same machine. Each application maintains a list of handlers that understand specific message types.p  pMy class has a number of parameterized registration methods. Some take a single type parameter. Some take a pair of parameters where one represents a request object and the other a response object. Here is what the RequestResponse handler registration looks likep  precodeprocedure TTelegraph.RegisterRequestHandlerltTRequest, TResponsegt   requestTypeToHandle string handler TFuncltTRequest, TResponsegt begin   FRequestHandlers.AddrequestTypeToHandle,     TRequestHandlerltTRequest, TResponsegt.Createhandler,     TRequest,     TResponse end codepre  pcodeFRequestHandlerscode is a codeTDictionaryltstring,TRequestHandlergtcode. The registration method is called like sop  precode  FTelegraph.RegisterRequestHandlerltTTestRequest, TTestResponsegtMy Request,      functionx TTestRequest TTestResponse     begin       Result  TTestResponse.Create       Result.Number  x.Number       Result.Message  FormatReceived s, [x.Message]     end codepre  pThe generic codeTRequestHandlerltT1,T2gtcode is a DTO that wraps the handler along with the types codeTRequestcode and codeTResponsecode. It inherits from the nongeneric codeTRequestHandlercode. Im not sure if theres a better way to go about this but it was the only way I could think of to store multiple unrelated types in a single collection. p  pThis all seems to work fine. The problem is when a request message is received.  The C code to handle request messages looks like thisp  precodeprivate void ProcessRequestTelegramTelegram request      var requestType  RequestHandlers[request.MessageType].RequestType     var typedRequest  JsonConvert.DeserializeObjectrequest.Payload, requestType     var result  RequestHandlers[request.MessageType].Handler.DynamicInvoketypedRequest     var jsonPayload  JsonConvert.SerializeObjectresult     var response  new Telegram              Payload  jsonPayload,         CorrelationID  request.CorrelationID,         Template  TelegramTemplateEnum.Response,         SenderWindowHandle  LocalWindowHandle.ToInt32,         RecipientWindowHandle  MessageRecipient.ToInt32,         MessageType  request.MessageType          var jsonResponse  JsonConvert.SerializeObjectresponse      var resultCode  Messaging.SendMessageMessageRecipient, jsonResponse     CheckIfSendMessageErrorOccurredresultCode  codepre  pIn the code above codeRequestTypecode is of the codeTypecode type.p  pBut for the life of me I cant come up with the Delphi equivalent. I get as far as attempting to deserialize the request.Payload and Im stuck at how to pass the JSON parser the type to convert the payload into. Ive tried various ways of storing codeTRequestcode and codeTResponsecode in the RequestType and ResponseType properties of codeTRequestHandlercode codeTTypeInfocode, codeTRTTITypecode and currently codeTClasscode. But nothing seems to give me anything useful to pass to codeTJson.JsonToObjectcode. It has a generic overload that takes a type parameter for the return type but apparently you cant use a codeTClasscode as a type parameter.p

Negative 61387 pI am working on a project which requires  extracting documents from a FileNet system. I need to extract documents identified by their ObjectID and store them in files.  The system is working under Windows and is using an Oracle 11G database. The question is is there a way to retrieve document content using direct database access and SQL Can I write an SQL query that retrieves the binary content of document by passing its ObjectID as a parameter.

Negative 61387 pWe have a LOB Winforms application that follows MVP pattern as much as possible.p  pAt each new release, we want to test against any regression.p  pCurrent approach is that every time a tester a bugcrash, we reproduce the bug, then insert a test using NUnit. Usually this test tries to reproduce the chain of actions followed by the user, so we end up with tests like  codeMenuXOperationYbuttonDoZClickERRORDESCRIPTIONcodep  pThe test usually prepares the context, load data, and execute the action clicked by the user to reproduce the bug. Then the bug is fixed and the test is rerun. And so on ..., until we have a large base of existing regression  tests. Example of such a test is p  precode[Test] public void MenuXOperationYbuttonDoZClickERRORDESCRIPTION       The presenter prepares Context amp Load Data associated with Menu X     PrsMenuX.PrepareContext     PrsMenuX.LoadData       Do Operation Y     PrsMenuX.OperationY       Click on Button Do Z     try              PrsMenuX.ButtonDoZClick          catch Exception ex              Assert.Failex.Message       codepre  pSo my question, is it the right approach  is NUnit the right tool for this, and how to improve this  Should the tests reproduces the users actions or should we unittest only low level functions that composes each users action p

Negative 61387 pI have an app written in Swift that is similar to a soundboard. Currently I just have a bunch of mp3s in the apps main bundle. Is it possible to remotely add more mp3s into the apps main bundle and then change a variable in the code to account for the new mp3s I want it so that I can dynamically add new mp3s without going through the whole app review process. Ideally a user would be able to open the app the next day and find that 15 new mp3s have been added without having to download an update. Is this a possibilityp
Negative 61387 pI have a class which has a multidimensional array containing a simple object which just stores a couple of integers. This data will be loaded once and some of the vector within will be returned  to other classes for them to use just reading the data. Each internal vector will be really big thousands of simple objects stored in it.p  pIm writing the example code with just the relevant stuff to my question. Code examplep  precodeclass MyClass  private     stdvectorltstdvectorltSimpleObjectgtgt multiData   class MyOtherClass  private     stdvectorltSimpleObjectgt data  codepre  pSo for example MyClass creates an object of type MyOtherClass and assigns one of the vectors to it, lets sayp  precodeMyOtherClass otherClass  CreateOtherClass otherClassgtdata  thisgtmultiData.at0 codepre  pIn this way, if I understand correctly, the whole stdvector will be copied and assigned to otherClass. Wouldnt this cause a performance issue when creating lots of MyOtherClassp  pIf that is right I thought I could use pointers for the storing the internal stdvectors. Lets say we use an stdsharedptr.p  precodestdvectorltsharedptrltstdvectorltSimpleObjectgtgtgt data codepre  pIs this the correct solution I want to avoid copying the whole stdvector each time since this seems costly and wrong.p  pAlso, if MyClass would later alter the data only the data in SimpleObject and not the actual length of any of the stdvector in anyway by using a pointer MyOtherClass would also see this changes, rightp  pedit This is different from How do I store different classes in a single vector. Im not concerned of how to store the actual classes, I just want to know if I should store an stdvector inside another stdvector by value or using pointers if Im going to be using the inside vectors in other classes.p

Negative 61387 pIm having difficulty choosing between codesizetcode and codeptrdifftcode for the type of an index, which should need to be able to store a negative value.p  pTo be precise, in my code I need to implement an array.

On my machine, this cuts the avaiable indexes in half since both codesizetcode and codeptrdifftcode are 64 bits, but one is codeunsignedcode and the other is codesignedcodep  pHere are the solutions that I came up with, but sadly none of them are perfectp  ol lipIn the constructor, accept a length of type codeptrdifftcode instead of codesizetcode, and add a check that verifies that the given length is not negative.p  pstrongProsstrong It solves the issue, since now I would be able ot access all the elements in the array, and still allow for negative indexes.p  pstrongConsstrong It limits the maximum possible length of the array. e.g. like I said earlier, in my machine it cuts by halfpli lipLeave things as they are, but in the code[] operatorcode, cast the index to type codesizetcode, and make use of the fact that negative value would overflow.p  pi.e. to the given index, add the difference between the element were currently pointing to, and the p  pfor example, in my example before, since vec2 points to the emsecondem element in the arary, the code[] operatorcode would look something likep  precodetemplateltclass Tgt Tamp MyVectorltTgtoperator[] stdptrdifft index      Since vec2 points to the second element, we add 1.

Negative 61387 pcoderootn floatt x, intt ncode is a function that computes the emnemth root xsup1nsup and is supported by some programming languages such as  a hrefhttpswww.khronos.orgregistryclsdk1.2docsmanxhtmlrootn.htmlOpenCLa. When IEEE754 floatingpoint numbers are used, efficient lowaccuracy starting approximations for any codencode can be generated based on simple manipulation of the underlying bit pattern, assuming only normalized operands codexcode need to be processed.p  pThe binary exponent of coderoot x, ncode will be 1n of the binary exponent of codexcode. The exponent field of an IEEE754 floatingpoint number is biased. Instead of unbiasing the exponent, dividing it, and rebiasing the result, we can simply divide the biased exponent by codencode, then apply an offset to compensate for the previously neglected bias. Furthermore, instead of extracting, then dividing, the exponent field, we can simply divide the  entire operand codexcode, reinterpreted as an integer. The required offset is trivial to find as an argument of 1 will return a result of 1 for any codencode. p  pIf we have two helper functions at our disposal, codeintasfloatcode which reinterpretes an IEEE754 codebinary32code as codeint32code, and codefloatasintcode which reinterpretes an codeint32code operand as codebinary32code, we arrive at the following lowaccuracy approximation to coderootn x, ncode in straightforward fashionp  precoderootn x, n  intasfloatintfloatasint1.0f1.01.0n  floatasintxn codepre  pThe integer division codefloatasint x  ncode can be reduced to a shift or multiplication plus shift by a hrefhttpsgmplib.orgtegedivcnstpldi94.pdfwellknown optimizations of integer division by constant divisora.

Otherwise, the approximation will provide an overestimation compared to the true mathematical result. We can approximately halve the emmaximum relative errorem by reducing the offset slightly, leading to a balanced mix of underestimation and overestimation. This is easily accomplished by a binary search for the optimal offset that uses all floatingpoint numbers in the interval [1, 2supnsup as test cases. Doing so, we findp  precoderootn x, 2  intasfloat 0x1fbb4f2e  floatasintx2  max rel err  3.47474e2 rootn x, 3  intasfloat 0x2a51067f  floatasintx3  max rel err  3.15547e2 rootn x,1  intasfloat 0x7ef311c2  floatasintx1  max rel err  5.05103e2 rootn x,2  intasfloat 0x5f37642f  floatasintx2  max rel err  3.42128e2 rootn x,3  intasfloat 0x54a232a3  floatasintx3  max rel err  3.42405e2 codepre  pSome may notice that the computation for coderootn x,2code is basically the initial portion of a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiFastinversesquarerootQuakes fast inverse square roota.p  pBased on observing the differences between the original raw offset, and the final offset emoptimized to minimize the maximum relative errorem, I could formulate a heuristic for the secondary correction and thus the final, optimized, offset value.p  pHowever, I am wondering whether it is possible to determine the optimal offset by some closedform formula, such that the maximum absolute value of the relative error, max approxx,n  xsup1nsup  xsup1nsup, is minimized for all codexcode in [1,2supnsup. For ease of exposition, we can restrict to codebinary32code IEEE754 singleprecision numbers. p  pI am aware that in general, there is no closedform solution for minimax approximations, however I am under the impression that closedform solutions do exist for the case of polynomial approximations to algebraic functions like emnemth root. In this case we have piecewise linear approximation.p

Negative 61387 pI am currently working on a project to develop an android app using codeIonicCordovacode. In this app we need to automatically connect to a wifi network using  codeEAP TTLScode and to do so we are developing a cordova plugin. p  pAs many tutorials suggest, we started the development by creating an Android app that did exactly what we wanted. Next, we turned it into a plugin. Up to that point everything was great, we achieved the desired functionality and added the plugin to the Ionic project without errors. p  pNow, when we execute the command  codeionic buildcode  we receive many errors related to the imports used in the plugin, for examplep  precodeimport android.net.wifi.WifiConfiguration  import android.net.wifi.WifiManager  import android.net.wifi.WifiConfiguration import android.net.wifi.WifiEnterpriseConfig import android.net.wifi.WifiManager import android.net.ConnectivityManager import android.net.NetworkInfo codepre  pFrom all the research done before the development we understood that any app that you could be develop directly for Android could be turn into a plugin.

I need some advise, and have no enough reputation to post a question in existing posts, where I found same code examples.p  pI got a task to add some classes in existing app and found there a service, which I need to work with.

And then app started to create and destroy this service like crazy.p  pI see this code here and there on stackoverflow to handle some periodical tasks but without explicitly calling onHandleIntent in onStartCommand, coz what for u need IntentService, which runs in UI thread, if I understood right IntentService conception. But is using this pattern will be correct for task, that executes so often Coz every time we creating all that objects in scheduleNextUpdate method, which garbage collector will have to destroy later. Wouldnt it be more correct to start e.g. just Service and run some Thread in it with something like java.util.Timer.scheduleAtFixedRate inside to perform checkingp  pI have no way to ask the person, who wrote this service, where he get that pattern and highly appreciate you help. typ

Negative 61387 pI am new to jspm and I am trying to evaluate JSPM as a replacement for my current apps that use requirejs. p  pHow does jspm handle multiple modulespackages For examplep  precodemycustomlib        src    jspmpackages        npm        github    config.js codepre  pThe above config.js file contains all the dependencies that are needed for mycustomlib.
