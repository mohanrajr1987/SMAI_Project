The MVP would be just the failed spec file names in a list or written to a file in an easy to read format xml, html, etc.. Next iteration I would have the describe and it block descriptions, error codes, and saucelabs link next to each failure similar the jasmine reporter.p  pI normally have hundreds of spec files in a single job, and having to comb through all the individual results just to track down which spec file failed is quite annoying since I feel an automatically generated summary should have that information. Im literally having to do a ctrlf on the console output for failures, just to see which specs have failed. I want to avoid going to saucelabs for the failure list, because of how our job runs are organized through Jenkins. The console output should be an easy first sourcereference for a list of failures once a job is done running.p  pEvery third party reporters scope seems to only go up to the spec file level. After each spec file is executed, it reports, then goes on to the next one which overrides the previous report. I open the HTML or XML report, and it always has just one spec files results. I cant seem to carry any information into a summary for multiple spec files. Ive tweaked the consolidateAll settings, and none seem to build a report for all spec files.

Negative 64900 pI have a case where a VB.Net winforms app needs to play WMV files from across the network. The user running the app cannot be given direct access to the network share. Through impersonation, I can see that the files exist without impersonation, File.Exists returns false for the files on the network share. When I then try to load the file into a Windows Media Player control, the control just remains black. I have deduced that when the Windows Media Player control is loaded into memory, it is running on a separate unmanaged thread than the .Net managed thread. Is there any way to pass that security token from the managed thread to the unmanaged thread Am I missing something completelyp

The table codebarscode has the same role as a link table would have.p  pI have a rule on inserting to codefoobarscode such that the foo part is inserted to codefooscode as a new row, and bar part, which consists of a couple of barids separated by commas is split, and for each such part a link between it and the appropriate codefoocode is created I use a procedure to do that.p  pThis works great for inserts. I have a problem, however, when it comes to updating the whole thing. The codefoocode part of the rule is easy. However, I dont know how to deal with the multiple codebarcodes part. When I try to do something like codeDELETE FROM bars WHERE fooidnew.fooidcode in the rule, I end deleting everything from the table codebarscode.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there a way of achieving what I need Finally, is my approach to the whole thing sensiblep  pI do this overcomplicated thing with the view because the data I get is in the form of codefoocode and all its codebarcodes, but the user must see just codefoobarscode.p

Negative 64900 pIm writing an application that needs to uncompress data compressed by another application which is outside my control  I cannot make changes to its source code. The producer application uses zlib to compress data using the zstream mechanism. It uses the ZFULLFLUSH frequently probably too frequently, in my opinion, but thats another matter. This third party application is also able to uncompress its own data, so Im pretty confident that the data itself is correct. p  pIn my test, Im using this third party app to compress the following simple text file in hexp  pcode48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 21 0d 0acodep  pThe compressed bytes I receive from the app look like this again, in hexp  pcode78 9c f2 48 cd c9 c9 57 08 cf 2f ca 49 51 e4 e5 02 00 00 00 ff ffcodep  pIf I try and compress the same data, I get very similar resultsp  pcode78 9c f3 48 cd c9 c9 57 08 cf 2f ca 49 51 e4 e5 02 00 24 e9 04 55codep  pThere are two differences that I can seep  pFirst, the fourth byte is codeF2code, rather than codeF3code, so the deflate final block bit has not been set. I assume this is because the stream interface never knows when the end of the incoming data will be, so never sets that bitp  pFinally, the last four bytes in the external data is code00 00 FF FFcode, whereas in my test data it is code24 E9 04 55code. Searching around I found on this pagep  pa hrefhttpwww.bolet.orgpornindeflateflush.htmlhttpwww.bolet.orgpornindeflateflush.htmlap  p...that this is a signature of a sync or full flush.p  pWhen I try and decompress my own data using the codedecompresscode function, everything works perfectly.

Negative 64900 pIm working on a medium sized project which contains several libraries with interdependences which Ive recently converted over to build using a nonrecursive makefile.  My next goal is to enable building of both debug and release builds out of the same source tree at the same time make debugmake release.  My first step was to make debug and release targets which contained the correct build flags.  I did this using target specific variables, like this     CXXFLAGSWall Wextra Werror DLINUXp  precodeCXXDEBUGFLAGSg3 DDEBUGALL CXXRELEASEFLAGSO3  .PHONY debug  debug CXXFLAGSCXXDEBUGFLAGS  debug build  .PHONY release  release CXXFLAGSCXXRELEASEFLAGS  release build codepre  pThis worked fine, but you could only build debug, or release, not both at the same time.  And by same time, I dont mean during the same build I mean back to back in the same source tree make debugmake release.  In order to do this I need to place the object files in a debugrelease specific directory so they dont overwrite each other and I need to mangle the debug target binary name with a D.  I though this would be easy as I could just use target specific variables again, like this     CXXFLAGSWall Wextra Werror DLINUXp  precodeCXXDEBUGFLAGSg3 DDEBUGALL CXXRELEASEFLAGSO3  .PHONY debug  debug CXXFLAGSCXXDEBUGFLAGS  debug MODULEBLDTYPED debug OUTDIRdebugobj debug build  .PHONY release  release CXXFLAGSCXXRELEASEFLAGS  release MODULEBLDTYPE release OUTDIRreleaseobj release build  .PHONY build build TARGETNAMEHelloWorldMODULEBLDTYPE build TARGETBUILDDIRPROJECTROOTDIROUTDIR build TARGETBUILDOBJSaddprefix TARGETBUILDDIR,SOURCES.cpp.o build TARGETNAME codepre  pYou make experts reading this already know this wont work because you cant use target specific variables to create actual targets.

When the user selects something, the div associated with the selection shows itself. The other script allows the user to add  remove or in other words clone the same piece of the form again.  Meanwhile, I would like the the initial dropdown cloned too, allowing the user to pick another or the same category again, and add  remove the piece of the form associated with the category they select.p  pIts kind of like a store with 3 product categories.  A customer comes in and wants to get a quote for a wide variety of product possibilities from 1 or all 3 product categories all in one inquiry.  p  pSo for example, a user selects from the initial dropdown category1. The form snippet associated with category 1 shows up and the user fills it in.  The user adds in another product, cloning the same form snippet that gets filled out again. Below all of this, the initial dropdown is also cloned and they can pick from lets say category2.  The form snippet associated with category 2 shows up, and the user can fill it in and add in another category 2 product form snippet, just like they did with category 1.  p  pI hope this made sense.  Anyway, the scripts work fine by themselves.  Its when I use them together, is where I am having problems.p  pHere is the first script I am using.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction     category1.hide     category2.hide     category3.hide     thechoices.changefunction     ifthis.value  all     boxes.children.show     else       this.value.show.siblings.hide           thechoices.change      ltscriptgt codepre  pHere is the second script.  I got it from here a hrefhttpvipullimbachiya.comp209 relnofollowhttpvipullimbachiya.comp209a.  It uses a separate .js file.  The script below activates it.p     precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction       .cloneanother.EnableMultiField         linkText Add Item ,         removeLinkText Remove Item ,         confirmOnRemove false,               ltscriptgt codepre  pp  pThis is my basic markup.p  precodeltformgt    ltdiv classcloneanothergt        ltselect idthechoicesgt            ltoption valuecategory1gtCategory 1ltoptiongt            ltoption valuecategory2gtCategory 2ltoptiongt            ltoption valuecategory3gtCategory 3ltoptiongt        ltselectgt        ltdiv idboxesgt            ltdiv idcategory1gt            ltpgtBox 1 stuff...ltpgt            ltdivgt            ltdiv idcategory2gt            ltpgtBox 2 stuff...ltpgt            ltdivgt            ltdiv idcategory3gt            ltpgtBox 3 stuff...ltpgt            ltdivgt        ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pThe problem is that the first script works.  It hides and unhides the form snippets according to what is selected in the initial drop down.  What does not work is the ability to clone the form snippet and the initial dropdown so that the user can do another inquiry for another product.  I know I am missing something big here, but I am not knowledgeable enough to know where to look or how to go about solving it.  I greatly appreciate any insight that can be given to me on this problem.p

Negative 64900 pI have an application that sits in the background and occasionally pops up an image on screen NSView whose NSWindow is transparent and has a 0alpha background. I have it set as a UIElement so that it doesnt show up in the dock or the application switcher. But I want it to show up when the user opens the preferences menu item of my status bar icon, which will let them configure it.p  pI know this is possible, because iStat Menus does it. But I cant figure out how. How do I do this Or should I just have it always be present in the dockapp switcherp  pedit Apparently iStat uses one process for the system tray, and one process for preference windows. Thats kind of hilarious. I think I might wind up just making it a UIElement and having a hidden preference window that gets sent orderFront when the preferences menu option is selected.p

Negative 64900 pI am trying to create my first real world application. Its a database driven via Web Services application in Flash Builder 4.p  pThe application will have over 30 different data entry form screens, list screens, search screens etc that all use different web services.p  pObviously I want to split this up so that its manageable as the application grows, and so that the application is as fast as possible initial loading can be slow if it has to  load all the elements, but I want it to be fast once the user is in the app.p  pThe approach I had up until now was to have my main application called layout, and then have a ViewStack with each of the different screens on it. This works well, however it means there is a fair bit of code to be maintained each time I add a new screen info on that is here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5645296swapmxmlcomponentinapplicationfromanothercomponentpossibleSwap MXML Component in Application from another Component  Possiblea p  pEach group of forms are related, so the clients area of the application has a data entry form, a few list forms. I need to pass parameters when it loads. ie. Load the data entry form with the ID of 123.p  pAt the moment I have a Component for each form, ie.  ClientForm and ClientList. Is this a good approach Should I be using Modules insteadp  pIs the ViewStack an efficient way of doing it p
Negative 64900 pbig explanation better safe..., question in bold if you dont want to read it all. Thanks a lot for your helpp  pI have an app with a codeListViewcode, and two custom XMLs. One is a single TextView, for the headers. The other has 3 TextViews and 3 ImageViews that represent the data.p  pAs most of you know, a hrefhttpjsharkey.org relnofollowJeff Sharkeya already has a a hrefhttpjsharkey.orgblog20080818separatinglistswithheadersinandroid09 relnofollowvery clever imho solutiona codeSeparatedListAdaptercode, which allows the class to work, without modifications, with ImageViews. Although it accepts codeStringcodes, I can provide the codevalueOfcode of the drawable int resources, and it will figure it out. Great, see code and screen at end his class not here for simplicity.p  pThe problem is that, strongfor my project, Ive been given a stack of inhouse, proprietary code to work with. And Sharkeys code is GPLv3, which rules out the possibility of me using his code. So maybe you could know a solution that would allow me to link to that code without my other code being attracted to the force of the GPLstrong. Im not discussing the politics of it, so I appreciate if you dont. Besides, Im not circumventing, Im avoiding it legally.p  pRight now, Ive been able to find a hrefhttpsgithub.comcommonsguycwacmerge relnofollowcwacmergea, which is ASL 2. But so far I couldnt map the strings and drawables to custom TextViews and ImageViews in a custom XML layout. Also, the example app uses a completely different approach to what I think I remotely need.p  pIn case you care to see what Im up to, see codeSeparatedListAdaptercode and my class below.

Negative 64900 pIm trying to show an OpenLayers map on a Symfony application, but without success.  Heres what I do 1. Include jQuery in layout.php 2. Include OpenLayers in layout.php 3.

A lot of time ago actually, sorry for the lazy update. My HTML and JS codes were all fine, the problem was the order of javascript inclusion in the view.yml. The order I now use and that makes things work is jQuery OpenLayers ExtJS GeoExt all my custom libs and codesp  pThanks to yall for the interest p
Negative 64900 pIm using WSSF in Visual studio 2010 sp1 and Im having an issue with WCF collections. It seems that when I create a service reference and change the advanced setting to use a Generic list instead of an array. I still get arrays when trying to use the collections. I would have to convert the array back and forth to a list whenever i want to add or remove objects. p  pDoes anyone know why or what i need to change for it to work ok. In the data contract designer, i have two types of collections. One is a Data Contract Collection, another one is Primitive Data Type Collection. p  pAny help is appreciated. p
Negative 64900 pHi knowledgeable Stack Overflow lot,p  pI have multiple developers trying to rsync files symfony php projects to the same remote location. This has been setup as followsp  ul liEach user has their own login on the remote serverli liEach user is a member of the same group on the server, say mygroupli liFiles locally and at the rsync destination are owned by a user and the group. E.g. someusermygroupli ul  pAs far as I am aware you must own a directory in order to set its access and modification times to an arbitrary value, being a member of the owning group is not enough. For this reason if user A tries to rsync directories owned by user B rsync outputs the following errorsp  precode rsync failed to set times on somepath Operation not permitted 1  rsync error some filesattrs were not transferred see previous errors code 23 at main.c1058 [sender3.0.5] codepre  pSo, what is the correct way to setup users amp groups when multiple users rsync to the same remote locationp

Negative 64900 pIve got the following situationp  precodevar large  [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i] var small  [a2, b2, c2, null, null, null, null, null, null, i2] codepre  pwhere every element of both arrays is an object.p  pThe small array contains information related to the the larger one, but not every element of codelargecode requires an associated element in codesmallcode and so I set it to codenullcode. However, I do still need to keep the indices the same so I can do things like codelarge[16].id     small[16].descriptioncode. Does the fact that Ive got an array thats mostly codenullcode in value result in increased memory usagep  pMy question is whether or not Id be better off doing something like codesmall  [a2,b2,c2,i2]code, and setting indices in properties like codea2.index  0 b2.index  1code and so on. p  pIve also come across a suggestion to use undefined instead and someone even mentioned implementing linked lists. I dont think I need to implement a linked list since Im not adding or removing elements very often.p

What I have been trying to do is create a sort of animation, created by this code running over and over, creating an animation of randomly appearing rectangles, with this codep  precodefor int i  0 i lt 10 i            [self performSelectorselectorexecuteFrame withObjectnil afterDelay.05i]          codepre  pThe first for loop is the only thing inside the codeexecuteFramecode function, by the way. So, what I need to do is to erase all the rectangles between frames, so the number of them stays the same and they look like they are moving. I tried doing this by just drawing the background again, by calling code[myNsBox display]code before calling codeexecuteFramecode, but that made it seem as though no rectangles were being drawn. Calling it after did the same thing, so did switching in codesetNeedsDisplaycode instead of display. I cannot figure this one out, any help would be appreciated.p  pBy the way, an additional thing is that when I try to run my code for executing the frames, without trying to erase the rectangles in between, all that happens is that 100 more rectangles are drawn. Even if I have requested that 1000 be drawn, or 10,000. Then though, if I leave the window and come back to it immediately, time is not a factor here, the page updates and the rectangles are there. I attempted to overcome that by with         code[box setNeedsDisplayInRectarray[i]]code which worked in a strange way, causing it to update every frame, but erasing portions of the rectangles. Any help in this would also be appreciated.p

Negative 64900 pI have a unit test using typemock 5.4.5.0 that is testing a creation service.  The creation service is passed in a validation service in its constructor.  The validation service returns an object that has a boolean property IsValid.  In my unit test I am mocking the validation service call to return an instance that has IsValid set to true.

Negative 64900 pI want to shuffle a list of unique items, but not do an entirely random shuffle. I need to be sure that no element in the shuffled list is at the same position as in the original list. Thus, if the original list is A, B, C, D, E, this result would be OK C, D, B, E, A, but this one would not C, E, A, D, B because D is still the fourth item. The list will have at most seven items.

Negative 64900 pI have an stlmap that has the key defined as an object I defined, and int. The use of the map is as follows I have a list of the specific object and I want to count how many identical objects I have. So I insert the objects into the map.if the object already exists in the map I increase its value hence the counter. The object has all the basic operators defined. The object consist of 5 strings. The  operator defined as the comparison of all 5 strings, and logically is meaningfull in the context. The problem is that the operator lt has no logic meaning in the context. I care only if the objects are equal. I cant define which of two different objects is bigger.so for the sake of stl map defined this operator as the result of if else ladder and in each if I compared with lt another string of the five. If true return true else, if.... And the last else returns false. In a specific case of the object , where I had three identical instances, I got the map containing two identical objects as keys, one of them had the counter of 1 and the other had 2. i cant understand what is the problem and how could it happen.

I am running Python 2.6.5, I am not sure about updating to 3.0 since Python was initially downloaded with my spatial analysis software. I am writing a program to search and replace column headers in multiple comma delimited text files.

Negative 64900 pHi guys I have been working with android recently and its fine until now.p  pWhen I want to handle a key down event I just override the onKeyDown method in my activity. The same with the key up event.p  pThe problem is that this just works for a single key, if I press to keys at the same time just one is handle.p  pFor examplep  precodeOverride public boolean onKeyDownint keyCode, KeyEvent event     boolean returnValue  super.onKeyDownkeyCode, event     switchkeyCode         case KeyEvent.KEYCODEA             Do something awesome here         return true          case KeyEvent.KEYCODEC             Do something even more awesome here         return true          return returnValue  codepre  pIf I press A and C at the same time one is processed first.p  pMy first idea was to set flags with the onKeyDown event to keep the track of what keys are pressed and clear the flags with the onKeyUp event, but this failed when I switch between activities.p  pNow what I want is something like the followingp  precodeOverride public boolean onKeyDownint keyCode, KeyEvent event     boolean returnValue  super.onKeyDownkeyCode, event     switchkeyCode         case KeyEvent.KEYCODEA             if C is pressed                  Do something not so awesome here                          else                 Do something awesome here                      return true          case KeyEvent.KEYCODEC             if A is pressed                  Do something not so awesome here                          else                 Do something even more awesome here                      return true          return returnValue  codepre

Negative 64900 pIm writing a web service which returns results. This results are some data that is being created on the server all the time. So when the client asks for a resource i want to give him also a url for the next query he can preform to get the new data created on the server. For example, client can start with the following urlp  precodehttpipportserveridresource codepre  pand next time he should use something likep  precodehttpipportserveridresource1234 codepre  pwhere 1234 is some pointer to the server to know which result the client has already recieved. So the question is, where do i return the url to the next set of results should it be in the header or in the body I read some reference about usage of url parameters vs. query, and if i understood for chaching i better use uri rather then query. Last thing, i need to pass info the body for the request and therefore the web service expects PUT and not GET. Restlet example will be mostly appreciated.p  pOne last thing, i must have id in the url, but there is no such uri asp  precode httpipportserver codepre  pso what would be the right way for users to know there id the results are returned per users id. the id ia allocated by completly different resource.p

Negative 64900 pIm implementing some abstract classes that extend Actor and provide some extra functionality [1].  However, pattern matching doesnt seem to be working within the receive statements.  If I send a case object codeConnectcode from a client to the server, and have a pattern match in the server of the formp  precodeprintlnStarting to receive, e.g.   Connect.getClass.toString receive    case Connect gt printlnGot a connected message   case m gt printlnGot something weird   m   of type   m.getClass.toString  codepre  pThen the output isp  precodeStarting to receive, e.g. class ConnectionTestConnect Got something weird Connect of type class ConnectionTestConnect ... codepre  pThe incoming message is not recognized as a codeConnectcode object in the pattern match even though getClass says it is.  Further weirdness codemcode has the same hashCode as codeConnectcode, and serializes to the exact same codeByteArraycode using codeObjectOutputStreamcode and codewriteObjectcode, but is not equal to it using codecode.  My best guess is that the classLoader is somehow behaving incorrectly, but Im at a loss.p  pHere is a more complete example of what Im trying to writep  precodeimport scala.actors.Actor, OutputChannel import scala.actors.Actor. import scala.actors.remote.RemoteActor import scala.actors.remote.RemoteActor. import scala.actors.remote.Node  abstract class ConnectionTestmasterNode Node, port Int     trait Message   case object Connect extends Message    abstract class Master extends Actor      def act        RemoteActor.classLoader  getClass.getClassLoader       aliveport       registerMasterProcess, self        while true          printlnStarting to receive, e.g.   Connect.getClass.toString         receive            case Connect gt printlnGot a connect message           case m gt printlnGot something weird   m   of type   m.getClass.toString                            abstract class Worker extends Actor      def act        RemoteActor.classLoader  getClass.getClassLoader       val master  selectmasterNode, MasterProcess       linkmaster       master  Connect          codepre  pHeres an example usep  precodeobject MyConnectionApp extends optional.Application     case class MyConTesthostname String, port Int extends ConnectionTestNodehostname, port, port      case object MyMaster extends Master     case object MyWorker extends Worker       def mainmaster Boolean       if master       MyConTestlocalhost, 2552.MyMaster start     else       MyConTestlocalhost, 2552.MyWorker start     codepre  pWhen I run this program, the output is as above.  The codeConnectcode message received remotely from codeMyWorkercode was not recognized by the pattern match in the act method of codeMyMastercode.  Even though codegetClass.toStringcode evaluates to the same thing on them, they are somehow not the same.  How can I fix thisp  p[1] More detail Im implementing a framework for a certain kind of parallel computation across a large number of nodes.  In a more complicated case, Id actually like to replace codeConnectionTestcode with codeParallelComputation[Data, Result]code where codeDatacode and codeResultcode are type parameters.

Negative 64900 pI want to initialize a global array of events everytime new events are fetched from the database. T explain some more, i want my events in a global array on the client side so that i can filter events without an ajax call. For example, if i have events, and each event has a country associated with it, i have multiple select box where you can select one or more country. I use the clientEvents functions to filter events taht match the criteria but the problem comes when the user starts reducing the filters. Then i need the events that i have already filtered out and for that i dont want to make an ajax call. So my approach is to have a global array of events, and when the user clears the filters, i just simply refectch all the events from that array.p  pNow the problem is , where to initialize that array if i do it in eventAfterRender, it changes in when the filtered events are being rendered, if i do it in viewDisplay, it isnt even initialized, i dont know why, i read somewhere that viewDisplay gets called before the events are rendered if you are using json feed. So i am stuck.... Please any help would be great. p

I understand that if it runs out, it invalidates itself, which is why I am using the IF statement to check if it has already been invalidated but it is not working. So I think the timer has already invalidated itself when this crash happens, but how do I check if it is already invalidatedp  pEDIT Ok I marked the correct answer below. I do not know if there is actually a reason why the code gets by the IF statements when the timer was not retained and has already invalidated itself, but the answer is to always use RETAIN if you are going to use the timer in an IF statement.p  pHere is related info a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions603044isthereanyreasontoretainaschedulednstimerifyoudontneedtoinvalidatIs there any reason to retain a scheduled NSTimer if you don39t need to invalidate itap

Negative 64900 pIve recently just gotten into programming with ruby on rails, and Ive been having trouble grasping how exactly I should be structuring and organizing all my code, specifically exactly how to differentiate what certain scaffoldsmodelscontrollers should be doing.p  pFor example, I have an app in which I want to have a front page with just an introduction page, giving the viewer an option to login or register standard welcome screen. Ive generated a Users scaffold, and I was planning on using this to handle all the main pages that the User sees in terms of their profile. Ive also been using devise to handle login and registration.p  pHowever, Im unsure exactly how to handle this welcome page. As of now, Ive merely altered the index.html.erb that the Users scaffold had automatically generated, but it doesnt really seem to fit, since its not really a page that has to do with the User profile.p  pIs there a general convention on how to separate the functionality of controllers What should I be doing with pages that dont necessarily have anything to do with specific database aspects for example, contact pages, welcome screens, etc..p  pAlso, Im a bit confused as to what the default applicationcontroller.rbs purpose is. It looks like everything is extending it, but should I be altering this possibly to use for the generic pages I mentioned abovep  pThanks in advance, sorry for the extremely long postp

Id like to give the my web app permission to access everything in desktopmywebfolder. Or at least listing rights so it can show me all my filesfolders even if it cant read it. p  pIs this possible or does the sandboxing prevent that Will chrome ask me for permission everytime or oncep

Negative 64900 pI have an application which uses ViewPager. Inside the ViewPager I dont use Fragments, just inflated views a RelativeLayout with some content. These views are precreated and held in a List. I created simple PagerAdapter implementation which overrides methods getCount, isViewFromObject, instantiateItem and destroyItem.p  pWhen running on Android 2.x device it all runs fine and the method instantiateItem is called just once for each page that gets loaded as an offscreen page.p  pBut when I run on ICS, the instantiateItem method gets called in a loop and the whole application stops responding. All I was able to realize was, that the instantiateItem method gets called as a result of a measurement. But I have no clue why on ICS the measurement gets called periodically in a loop and what can I do to stop it.p  pHere is a code snippet, but I believe theres nothing special on itp  precode    mAdapter  new PagerAdapter              Override         public boolean isViewFromObjectView arg0, Object arg1                      return arg0  arg1                   Override         public int getCount                      return mPages.size                   Override         public Object instantiateItemViewGroup container, int position                      View v  mPages.getposition             boolean isChild  false             forint idx  0 idx lt getChildCount idx                              ifgetChildAtidx  v                                      isChild  true                     break                                           ifisChild                 addViewv             return v                   Override         public void destroyItemViewGroup container, int position, Object item                      removeViewViewitem                    setAdaptermAdapter codepre  pThis code gets place in an initialization method of a class which derives from ViewPager.p  pI would really appreciate any hint, because this issue is driving me crazy and makes my application unusable on ICS devices.p
Negative 64900 pI am crating a program in java that reads an Input Stream of a file, encrypts it by changing around the numbers of the bytes based on what the password is, and creates a new encrypted file.p  pstrongFor examplestrongbr I created a test file that contained the wordsbr codeThis is a test to see if the encrypter project works.codebr When I read the bytes in java, I getbr code[84, 104, 105, 115, 32, 105, 115, 32, 97, 32, 116, 101, 115, 116, 32, 116, 111, 32, 115, 101, 101, 32, 105, 102, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 101, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 101, 114, 32, 112, 114, 111, 106, 101, 99, 116, 32, 119, 111, 114, 107, 115, 46, 10]codebr So then I take the value of each byte, and subtract the unicode value of the passwords, and get the absolute value of that.

Is filetype information standardh3  ul liDo these bytes have a meaning that is standard across all platforms ie. a pdf file is a pdf file no mater what computer you use it on. Is that because of the code.pdfcode extension, or is it because of the bytes that are somewhere in the file.li ul  h34. Assuming the filetype is recognized because of bytes in the file, how can I change the filetypeh3  ul liWhere can I find a listing of what bytes mean what in a fileli ul

Negative 64900 pSo Ive been programming this thing that allows a user to click a button once every 24 hours and is blocked to do so in the meantime. The concrete example is a vote script that should only allow a vote every 24 hours albeit a user can vote for the same thing again.p  pSo what I did was create a timelimit table in MySqlp  precodeCREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS timelimit    ipaddress VARCHAR50 NOT NULL ,   ipdate DATETIME NOT NULL ,   PRIMARY KEY ipaddress  ENGINE  MyIsam codepre  pThe IPaddress is a string because I was too lazy to convert it to a proper integer format and  it should allow for IPv6 addresses, too. Also theres no 128 bit integer, is therep  pIll leave the other table that saves the votings out, I dont think its in the scope of this question.p  pSo my issue is... random. Some people couldnt vote for days straight, for example. Also we saw a rapid increase a few hundred in one day once. We suppose though that was the work of a bot, since this script doesnt yet have any security in terms of verifying if that actually was a click by a user and its pointless, because everything can be done by bots. Just a matter of making it harder.p  pI just voted today and tried again, the program told me I can vote again in... 0 hours and 59 minutes... It should rather be 23 hours and 59 minutesp  pSomething is so wrong here and I cant put my finger on it.

Negative 64900 pIm developing a project of mine with scalability in mind and Ive come to a crossroad. On my website I would like to detect if a user is online or not.

The way I was thinking would be something along these linesin psuedocodep  precode SQL user table user    name blah blah,   email derpyderpyderp.com,   online false  codepre  pSo whenever the user logs in I could update his codeonlinecode column to codetruecode. However that would eventually lead to SQL queries happening every time a user logs in and if it happens that I get say, 10 logins per second, well, thats a lot of queries happening. Another way I figured I could do the same thing but in a different tablep  precode Activity table activity    userid 2,   online true  codepre  pFor some reason I believe that would lead to less memory consumption because of the separation from the codeusercode table. However Im not sure if it would have any actual effect on performance.p  pSo if you could bless me with your insight I would be more then grateful, thank you.p

Negative 64900 pI have a windows forms application that talks to several web services and third party components that requires myriad of logins based on username and password. Ideally, I want to keep a cache of username and password in my windows form application and I should be able to extract this when I want. For example, when I invoke sharpsvn client it requires NetworkCredential. The question is once I collected username and password for a service from the user, where do I keep them in windows form application and how can I retrieve them I dont want to pass username and password or any object of it around my method boundaries. The methods should know how to extract the credential from the current context. I would like to know a method where I can retrieve a saved collection of NetworkCredential  when I want.  What are my options Is thread local storage is the place to store such information. Can I use CurrentPrinciple for this task I have deeply nested methods calls and having a global hash table of such credential is not suitable.  I want to extract a collection of NetworkCrendential from current context. Note that this is a a windows form application not an ASP.net app.  p

Negative 64900 pIm just learning ASP.net and also making a web app for a friend in the same.p  pNow, in my app, there is a table that maps users to companys branches, and another to map branches to clients.

This happens a lot of times and is required on many pages.p  pAlso, Im using DevExpress GridView and GridViewLookUp tools. If youre familiar with them, they are just like GridView in ASP.net and cause a postback each time the displayed entries are sorted or a different page is selected for viewing the entries. Basically, I want to to know that I have to fire the above two queries a lot of times.p  pThere are on an average 100150 clients that a user is usually responsible for.p  pSo what I want to know is, for a number that high, should I retrieve all the client names and store them in a session so that I dont have to connect to the database again as long as the user is logged in Or should I just keep it the way it is and let it find clients every time from the databasep

Negative 64900 pThe company I work for is currently in the process of moving over our site from a full HTML site with no CMS to Magento. Our products are very customizable and a lot of the options that are available are dependent on each other. I also have our menu system and how it appears dependent on the currentlyselected product options. This being said, Magentos custom options system does not out of the box allow for the customization I need to make the products options menu work the way I need. Instead of trying to reinvent the Magento wheel, I figured the easiest way to do this would be to have the item pull the custom options from a PHTML file. This way I can specify which options to pull based on the product type an attribute. I was able to get that part working fine. The issues I am having are as followsp  ol liprice will not update when options are selectedli lioptions are not sent to cart when i add to cartli ol  pHow can I bypass Magentos builtin custom options system and still have my custom options from the phtml file send to the cart when you add along with changing the price Hope I was clear.

Does Mac use a different color code than CentOS If so, how can I standardize my coloring in bothp

Negative 64900 pIm building a server on Ruby using WebSockets through EventMachine.p  pLets say user Carl asks for a Car.p  pThe car of id 7 is requested to the CarManager. CarManager creates a Car instance, Car loads itself from a Mongo Database id was provided. Car 7 is stored in CarManager, like a cache, as long Carl or anyone else keeps using or requesting it. And then Car is sent through WebSocket, specifically to Carl. I stored Carls WS somewhere.p  pWhat if two users, say, Lenny and Carl, both ask for Car id 7 at the exact same time. Will CarManager, because it cant find in either case a cached version of Car 7, fetch it both times from database and instantiate it, or ONE of these two WebSocket request will be processed first, and then the second one will use the cached versionp  pThe whole asynchronous thing of WebSockets made me a bit confused. Thank you for any insights on thisp

Negative 64900 pFor a while now I have been building websites using HTML5 and I love using the new tags it offers.  The ability to avoid using div after div is a wonderful thing and it leads to cleaner and easier to read html.  Something that has me a bit confused is when its semantically correct to use a div tag. I understand a div is a collection of semantically markedup content that may need to be grouped together but ive seen numerous ways of writing HTML5 and how programmers use divs and Im just not sure whats the right way and wrong way or in other words the ok way and the better way. p  pFor example p  precodeltdiv idheadergt     ltheadergt         lth1gtHere is a headerlth1gt     ltheadergt        ltdivgt  ltheader idheadergt     lth1gtHere is a headerlth1gt ltheadergt codepre  pBoth are ways to write html but is one more semantically correct then the other  Is it best practice to add a id or class to a header, footer, nav or aside tag and style them, or is that for div tags Or is it possible im just over thinking this If someone can help put my mind to rest and give me a good understanding, that would be greatp

Here are the important details regarding my implementation.p  ul liThis package is exporting data from an iSeries system, to SQL Server 2005 data tables. li liThis process works successfully but keeps crashing on one, specific table export.  In fact, it runs without any trouble for over 2 hours before it dies.  After inspecting all properties associated with this step, I can see that there is nothing different about this step  compared to the other table export steps, other than the tablecolumn export  mappings.li liThe package codeProtectionLevelcode is set to codeDontSaveSensitivecode and the iSeries  credentials are stored in a config file that is accessed by SQL Server. li liI can execute the failing step on my machine, in BIDS. Regardless, it doesnt  work on the server, though the server is using the exact same credentials.li liAs I mentioned, I have two packages.  They are effectively the same thing, except  one is exporting the data from one iSeries database, and the other is exporting  data that is almost the exact same structure from another iSeries DB.  The first  package doesnt have any trouble even though it is using the same iSeries credentials.li liTo be clear, nothing on my server has changed in months that I am aware of.  This  just started happening yesterday morning.li ul  pAny tips, or thoughts would be tremendously helpful.  This export is extremely important and many usersworker rely on this data for their daytoday work.  Thank you.p

Negative 64900 pIm a system administrator who has full administrative access to a computer lab which dual boots windows and mac machines. Im looking for a way to prevent users from logging off or shutting down the computer until my kbox  radmind  bash scripts run at the end of the day. p  pEven if you would suggest implementing Active Directory  kiosk mode  other more administratively sound solutions, please dont. Many of the users need administrator access to the computers in order to install their own stuff albeit temporarily on the machines. I reimage all of the machines remotely at the end of the day, and Im confident in that process.p  pThe irony of the situation is that by giving the users administrative access, they could theoretically reverse my changes and find the hidden log off button, or use cmd to shutdown the computer. Dont worry about that. Most, if not all, of the users will be too lazy.p  pSo how do I properly hide the logoff button that is usually at the bottom of the start menu And how do I hide it on the task manager p  pIve tried editing the group policy gpedit.msc as specified a hrefhttpwww.techpavan.com20080808howtodisableenableshutdownlogoffstartmenu relnofollow titlehere.herea. It doesnt work  Im not sure which options to definitively enable to remove the button. p  pUsing software is an option, but Windows is smart enough to have a force logoff override thingy if a program is blocking shutdown or logoff. Which sucks for me.p  pThank you all so much.  p

PersistentdefaultFetchGroup  true     Elementdependent  true     private SetltKeygt mySet  new HashSetltKeygt      ...  codepre  pWhich I first persist and then read back like sop  precodepm.getFetchPlan.setGroupFetchPlan.DEFAULT pm.getFetchPlan.setMaxFetchDepth1 myInstance  pm.getObjectByIdMyClass.class, key codepre  pWhats bizarre is that this works fine the first time after a server restart. However, the second time I make the query, mySet remains null.p  pI have been trying the same with an ArrayList, but no luck. Im completely clueless as to what might cause behaviour like this, so any vague pointers as to what may be the cause would be greatly appreciated.p  pbUpdatebp  pI found a fix, but I dont understand why it works. If I add a copy constructor for User and copy the instance after the read, it works consistently. I would assume that theres a cache that always hands me back the same instance, but stepping through the program, I cant find any code that would set roles to null. Is this likely to be a side effect Im overlooking or is there a more fundamental issue that Im not understandingp

Negative 64900 pI have an html5 canvas to which user can add shapes. shapes have all kind of behaviors  they are resizable, they can be moved around, etc. I need to save it, so I can reload later user added shapes,saved, closed the browser. when he reopens the browser, he should get the same canvas with the shapes as he saved them before. he should be able to moveresize the exisiting shapes and to add new onesp  ptoDataURL is not good for me, because it converts canvas with all the shapes to an  image, so all the existing shapes are lost. Is there some way to save the canvas or maybe the context as an object to the db and reload it laterp

So, the .jar is compiled against the libjpeg.so.62 headers and I need it to compile agains the libjpeg.so.8. Ive tried deleting the libjpeg.so.62 and recompiling but that didnt work. Any helpp

Negative 64900 pI am working on a motion detection project using opencvpython.

I wish to determine my moving targets where there may be more than 1 by using Numpys or opencvs kmeans algorithm. However, these algorithms require an input of an array of x,y coordinates to be used. Whats the fastest and most efficient method to convert a 2d image bitmap array to an array of x y coordinates i.e. were talking image processing here, so slow Python code is undesirable.p

Ive got a full background slideshow which I would like to sync up with some text that will appear on screen. As you can see, this text is represented by the p fadeIns. My problem is that my current method for ensuring that the text always appears on the correct background slide is just to delay the last image, which is less than ideal as it goes out of sync. Id appreciate someone telling me a better way this can be done D I was thinking we could tell the fadeIn function to activate as soon as the first background image appears on screen, but an unsure how to do this.p

For the record, Id like to summarize herep  ol lipTo get filled symbols on the graph, you need to specify both col color and bg background. This is true even for codepch21code and codepch22code, which do not automatically get filled by the color specified. To get filled symbols in the legend, you need to specify both col and pt.bg. Here, bg alone is not good enough.pli lipits a very bad idea to use codeparnewTRUEcode with codeaxesFALSEcode, as I had done initially, because, the overlaid plots do not necessarily use the same coordinate system. The intended function for the second plot was code1002x22code but I inadvertently wrote code1x22code and did not realize it because I had set axesFALSE. pli ol  pAll in all, here is my preferred solutionp  precodecurve x22   , from  0   , to  100   , n  30   , type  p   , pch  21  alternatively pch15 is a solid symbol   , col  red  colors the outline of hollow symbol pch21   , bg  red  fills hollow symbol pch21 with color   , xlab  x   , ylab  y  curve 1002x22   , from  0   , to  100   , n  30   , type  p   , pch  22   alternative pch16   , col  blue   , bg  blue   , add  TRUE  legend topleft   , inset  c0,0.4,    , cex  1.5,    , bty  n,    , legend  cA, B,    , text.col  cred, blue,   , col  cred, blue,    , pt.bg  cred,blue   , pch  c21,22  codepre  pThis yields a plot like the one shown by joran.

Negative 64900 pIm trying to implement a NavigatorPanel for my NetBeans module. Now I would like to always get notified whenever the associated DataObject was modified so that I can invoke the parser and update the navigator.p  pI tried adding a PropertyChangeListener to the DataObject, but that only notifies me about the first change made to the document and thats it. However, Ive noticed that the first time PropertyChangeListener.propertyChange method is invoked, the propertyName is set to COOKIE and the second time to MODIFIED.p  pAny ideas on how to strongalwaysstrong get notified when the content of the document in the editor not the underlying FileObject has changedp  pstrongEDITstrong I already looked at a hrefhttpwiki.netbeans.orgDevFaqListenForSaveEvents relnofollowhttpwiki.netbeans.orgDevFaqListenForSaveEventsa. They state that the PropertyChangeListener is used for getting informed about documents being saved e.g. by CtrlS and if one wants to be notified about modifications to the content, FileChangeListener should be used instead. But that didnt work for me. In either case I dont get notified when Im modifying the document in the editor, except for when using PropertyChangeListener, then I do get notified, but only the first time I edit something exactly the opposite as what they write in the FAQ.p  pstrongEDIT2strong I havent figured out how to get properly notified yet. But in my case I should have actually approached my goal from a different perspective, i.e. since I want to update the NavigatorPanel based on parsing results, I should probably be registering a ParserResultTask. By that I can define when I should get notified, and when I do get notified I also get the already parsed results I would need for updating the panel.p  pWell, this is not a direct answer to the actual question but a more suitable solution for this particular problem.p

Negative 64900 pWe have a Visual Basic 6 application that connects to a local MS Access mdb file to store some values during work processing. The connection to this file is done via a user DSN ODBC connection. We have determined that the path of the connection is valid.

Negative 64900 pIn my project, I am trying to add a button collection user control to an input based user control.  The button uc is going to be added to numerous other controls.  The problem that Ive encountered is that the button uc is losing whatever css styles that Ive attach to it, once it is added to the parent uc.  Initially, I had a panel on the parent that would add the button uc when the page was loaded, then I would add the button uc to the panelp  pcodepanel.controls.adduccodep  pThis did not work, the styling of the buttons were lost. Next, I tried to set the positioning to the button uc and add it directly to the formp  precodestatic void SetLocationUsercontrol uc uc.Attributes.addstyle,left425pxtop420px     public void SetPage  button  ucLoadControlbutton.ascx SetLocationbuttonuc this.Controls.Addbuttonuc  codepre  pBut, this did not work either, it did not even locate the control properly.  My style sheet is already added to the parent uc, and the button uc to be added has its style on that sheet. I dont want to have to manually add the buttons to each uc parent.  Thank you for any help. I sure Im just missing something obvious, but Ive yet to come upon a similar issue in a search. Thank you.p

Negative 64900 pI have 5 divs layered and a object in the foreground I want to move across them. This is using the paralax effect. I have been sucessfully able to move the object using basic .animate in jQuery. p  pThe problem Im having is getting the background divs to animate properly  or at all. What happens is when I click on my trigger div  the div.cloud1 and div.cloud2 move BEFORE my object does. They also change positions despite my playing with the timing values. p  pAll objects in the divs are absolutely positioned  the divs are relative for being able to use zindex. p  pSpecifically Im trying to move div.cloud1, div.cloud2, div.ground, div.Mountain all at different speeds so it gives the illusion of 3d. p  pThe object Im sending across is a different div. p  pIm not sure what the problem is.p  pHere is my JSfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netU6Mu6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netU6Mu6ap  precode jQuerydocument.readyfunction       jQuerycloud01.css         backgroundPosition 50 180px          jQuerycloud02.css         backgroundPosition 0 100px          jQuerymountains03.css         backgroundPosition 0 50px          jQuerytrees04.css         backgroundPosition 0 50px          jQueryground.css         backgroundPosition left bottom          jQuerybranding.css         backgroundPosition center 0          jQuerycontent.css         backgroundPosition center 0          jQueryseccontent.css         backgroundPosition center 0          jQueryfooter.css         backgroundPosition center 0          jQuerywrapper.css         overflow hidden           jQueryklicker.clickfunction           jQuerycloud01.animate             backgroundPosition 100px 10px         , 200000         jQuerycloud02.animate             backgroundPosition 400px 0px         , 20000         jQuerymountains03.animate             backgroundPosition 2500px 50px         , 20000         jQueryground.animate             backgroundPosition 5000px bottom         , 20000          startHim          jQueryfullrobot.animate             left 50,             marginLeft 150px         , 2000         setTimeoutleaveScreen, 15000         var num  1  function startHim      num     jQueryseccontent.animate         top 5px     , 150.animate         top 5px     , 150     jQuerycontent,branding.animate         top   num  px     , 150.animate         top   num  px     , 150     if num lt 4          setTimeoutstartHim, 300      else          setTimeoutbounceHim, 300        function bounceHim      jQueryseccontent,branding.animate         top 4px     , 150.animate         top 4px     , 150     jQuerycontent.animate         top 8px     , 150.animate         top 8px     , 150     setTimeoutbounceHim, 300   function leaveScreen      jQueryfullrobot.animate         left 100,         marginLeft 0px     , 2000  codepre  pJust FYI  some of the objects in the fiddle are not included on purpose.

Negative 64900 pI have to process a big array of string in Java, which cant be kept in memory. Because of this, the array must be processed in several chunks. The size of each chunk can be specified by the programs user, but if the user doesnt specify a size, the program must decide the most appropriate size.p  pMy first thought was to use a indisk database like cassandra. That way, every time I want to process a chunk of the big array, I would do a query to the database. The problem I saw was that Id need to control available memory of the JVM and RAM, which I think would be too difficult. Also, I would have to figure out how to set the size of each chunk to make the most of the available memory without filling it.p  pFor that, Ive thought about using something like MemCached or SSDB alternative to Redis that allows you to store a part of the database in disk  a hrefhttpsgithub.comideawussdb relnofollowhttpsgithub.comideawussdba, but Im not sure if thats the best option. The idea is that Memcached or SSDB would help manage the exchange of data between memory and disk without me having to implement any control to avoid filling memory. p  pReally, I dont like too much the idea of adding dependencies Memcached or SSDB just to make my program function.p  pThen, my question is are there any good alternatives to solve my problem Is the previous reasoning wrongp  pThanks in advancep  pstrongCLARIFICATIONS strongp  pstrongWhat kind of processing do you have to dostrong processing is related to data analysis techniques for getting information using existing data in the big arrayp  pstrongHow big is the array How big are the strings Is your processing random access or sequential Why cant you just use a filestrong the size of the array can change, it havent a fixed value. The idea is that a user not enduser can processing an array in chunk when its neccesary for him. For example, an user maybe want to process an array of size 100.000 in several chunk and other user dont need to process an array in several chunk while the size of the array is less than 1.000.000 depending on the size of memory of each user. My processing is sequential. I dont use a file because in other questions of this page recommend that its better to use a database rather than a file. Moreover, if I used a file, I have to control the available memory space, preventing the memory is full and an error occurs in the programp  pstrongWhere are the Strings you wanna process Are they already stored somewhere, or do you generate them somehow on the flystrong Strings are obtained from users and they were stored in an array completely. Now, the idea is to store the strings passed by the user to the database, and later when user decide, the processing of strings will be done it havent to be immediately after storing the strings in the database.p

Negative 64900 pI have an app with a bunch of models and templates to perform a certain task its called a user access review, but thats not important  the app is called uar. When the users have completed their task, we want to archive the data from the main models into what were calling history tables. Those tables are identical in structure to the original uar tables, but may live in another database or may be in the same database. They will, however, be readonly except by the process that archives them into these history tables, and possibly a task that expires items after a certain number of years. p  pSince I wanted the exact same model structure but different names, I thought Id just make an app called uarhistory and symlink the models.py file between the two apps. But when I attempt to codesyncdbcode the new models, I get a lot of complaints about the models not validating because of the coderelatednamecode back link on the foreign keys.p  pIs there a better approach to this Should I just make all my archive tables subclasses of the model classes insteadp

Negative 64900 pI created the following codeuitablecodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7r3uT.jpg altbugp  pactually every single row is an indpendent codeuitablecode, so the figure shown contains 5 uitables besides the header.

Fully executable code you can find in the answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma195699512605073herea or a minimal example below. Solutions using a general GUI are also there, but it would blow up the code too much, and actually it just seems to be a kind of bug.p  pIt can be seen that everytime I jump to the next row, therefore to another uitable, the last selection remains highlighted, which looks stupid, though it doesnt matter for the functionality.p  pThere is the codeSelectionHighlightcode property for uitables, sounds like a solution, but it is not changing anything. I used it as followingp  precodesetsrc,SelectionHighlight,off  where src is the handle of the current uitable codepre  pat various places at the end of a codeCellSelectionCallbackcode, at the end of a codeCellEditCallbackcode and as global property. But everytime the last cell remains selected. Actually I dont need selection at all. p  pstrongHow can I disable the whole selection or selection highlighting property for all my uitablesstrongp  pstrongHow do I have to use this property, that it has an effectstrongp  pstrongAlternatively how can I change the highlighting color and therefore textcolor so the highlighting is just not visible anymorestrongp  pApparently this issue appears also a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.commatlabcentralnewsreaderviewthread254304 relnofollowin other contextsa.p  hr  pI created a strongminimum executable examplestrong, where one can select a number between 1 and 3 in every row.p  precodefunction minimalTable   basic properties lineheight  21.32 tableheight  3lineheight lh  lineheighttableheight  h  figurePosition,[200 100 202 tableheight],numbertitle,off,MenuBar,none   addrowfigurehandle,number of row, percentage lineheight  every function call creates a new row, later dynamically addRowh,1,lh addRowh,2,lh addRowh,3,lh end  function modifySelectionsrc, setsrc,SelectionHighlight,off waitforsrc end  function [th]  addRowfh,k,lhp selector   1 2  3  defaultData    select number... columnformat     selector    columneditable   true  th  uitablefh,Units,normalized,Position,[0 1klhp 1 lhp],...

Negative 64900 pSo Im trying to create a dialog box that asks the user for an input a number with pythons builtin Tkinter library. In particular, I googled that this could be easily achieved with the method simpledialog.askinteger. p  pIn a normal tkinter.button, I have the argument command which allows me to call a method. This is how I first made this part of my code within the main windowp  precode   self.generategamebutton  tkinter.Buttonself.mainwindow, textStart,          commandself.creategrid codepre  pBut as I want to ask for this number in a pop up window,  in tkinter.simpledialog.askinteger, there is no argument for command, so Im left with no way of calling my creategrid method... The code looks likep  precode    def pressnewgameself         global a         a  tkinter.simpledialog.askintegerInputz, Enter the gameboard size codepre  pMy creategrid method basically makes a set of buttons using the inputted int... How can I achieve this using a pop up window to ask the user for a number, and then call the create grid method similar to how the tkinter.Button worksp  pI hope this makes sense... Thanks.p

However, when I drag from g2col1 for example, it will only drop into g2col1 or g2col2, not anything in group1. Ive already tried making the minheight of the group1 columns large enough that theres a droppable area. Ive also tried binding a function to the start property of the sortable so that when something is being dragged, it makes a dummy div in the target column for the one Im dragging to drop onto.p  pBut nothing seems to work. The sortable items just want to stay within their group no matter what I try. I would especially like it if there were a way to keep the items distributed evenly between the two columns though. For instance, if there were a way to lock the sortable so that items could only be swapped and not make space for any new ones.p  pThat way I could make dummy positions on start and only allow the dragged items to fall onto the existing items or newly created dummies.p  pSo perfect situation aside, Id settle for being able to drag between groups p

Negative 64900 pIm doing some algorithm practice and came across this.p  pI have a listarray, something like this [1, 5, 4, 9, 10, 2, ...]p  pHow would I go about returning finding unique sets of the list that have the same sum For example, 5, 4 would equal 9 and 1, 5 would equal 6 and so on.p  pI am familiar with finding all the sets of a list, but the added trick to this is that the sets have to be unique as in if one index was used for one set, the same index cannot be used for the other set.p  pAny thoughts Thanks.p  pEditp  pAfter thinking about this some more, here is what I have. I make a list of all possible sets, not worrying about unique. Then I get the min and max of the original superset array. I loop through the values from min to max, incrementing by 1 and check each set. Create a hashmap. If the sum of the set is equal to the value we are checking, we add that set to a list. Additionally, we set the value associated key in the hashmap to True if the the value of an index of a set has a key. Keep on checking each set with the hashmap conditional. Then we return the list of list that should only have the unique sets.p  pMake sensep

Negative 64900 pEnd goal is I am trying to build an executable jar in eclipse with maven, thats packaged with its dependencies like so. The end file structure Im trying to accomplish is the following..p  precodetargetmydistributable.zip          lib all third party jars, which I have loaded through maven          images the images my swing app can reference          myapplication.jar my executable jar, manifiest within with correct classpath references          myapplication.properties the properties my app reads and can modify          README.TXT codepre  pFrom here the end user would be able to unzip the distributable zip file, double click on the jar to start a java swing application which has dependencies located in the lib directory. And theres a text editor inas part of the swing app that Id like to have reference images from the images directory. What I would like to accomplish is having maven create a zip file which contains everything in this dist folder, including my executable jar and its dependencies located in a lib directory.p  pI know I need to have my exec jars manifest include the Main class from which to run the application, and include the lib and images directory on the classpath of the manifest as well as my properties file.p  pI have tried several combinations of the maven shade plugin which seems to throw everything in one jar not useful here as I need the zip with my exec jar inside, and lib outside the exec jar, and

Negative 64900 pThe title is a little confusing so let me explain. Id like to create a content div area that has a small column on the left line that has line numbers, just as youd see in some sort of IDE or text editor.p  pFor an example, check out this site a hrefhttpcodehearted.me relnofollowhttpcodehearted.meap  pYou can see that it displays line numbers in that main content section, and its height matches whatever height the main content area is.p  pIve read some stuff on how to create multiple columns that set all the column heights to the tallest one, but thats not exactly what I need here. In order to implement the column with the line numbers, Ive put in a bunch of numbers inside that number column div like sop  precodeltdiv idlineNumbersgt     ltspangt1ltspangt     ltspangt2ltspangt     ltspangt3ltspangt         .         .         .     ltspangt98ltspangt     ltspangt99ltspangt     ltspangt100ltspangt ltdivgt codepre  pThis is how that example website seems to have implemented it, but when I try to do it, it lists all the numbers 1100 and makes the content area way too tall. Instead of the content area matching the lineNumbers height, Id like the lineNumbers height to match the real contents div height, with it cutting the rest of the numbers off at the bottom in the correct fashion.p  pAny ideas on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated.

Because actually ResourceConfig is not a Servlet. I will explain this issue nowp  pI have extended ResourceConfig.class, which is a subclass of an Application.class. This Application class is not an extended Java servlet, but an own class of Jersey. I though an Application is called on the startup of the web container. However, in the Jersey specification can be read, that the Application class needs to be itself handled by a ServletContainer.class which is a subclass of a Java Servlet. This handling is defined in the web.xml. And in the end, everything is a servlet here.p  pAs its not possible to get the port on startup, its of course possible when a request is dispatchedp  precodePathexample public class ServletMethods      GET     public Response exampleHeaderParamHost String host           return Response.okhost.build       codepre

Negative 64900 pIm working on an assignment for a class where I have to make an external JavaScript file that checks a pages current width and changes the linked CSS style based on it, and have that occur whenever the page loads or is resized. Normally, we are given an example to base our assignment off of, but that was not the case this time around.p  pEssentially we are to use an if...then statement to change the style. I have no clue what the appropriate statements would be for the function. Ive looked around and the potential solutions are either too advanced for the class or dont go over what I need. As far as I know I cannot use jQuery or CSS queries.p  pIf someone could give me an example of how I would write this out, I would be very appreciative.p

Negative 64900 pIm losing some but not all changes to my Mongoose model when populating after a save. I splice a random here simplified to just the first element out of an array and assign it into another variable.

Negative 64900 pIve tried several combinations but have not found one yet that will display gracefully without adding unneeded scrolls bars.  p  pI have a page that displays a Navigation column and then a content column.  In the content column I am displaying a PDF in an IFrame.  The left hand column is fixed at say 150px.  I need the the right hand column to consume the rest of the width of the page and all of the height of the page.  For some reason when the IFrame is put in the right hand div grows by about 5px and it adds an additional scroll bar that just mucks things up.  I can make the scroll bar go away using the overflowy hidden but that seems to be hack rather than the right thing to do.p  pIve tried it with both an iframe and object tags and the behavior is the same.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltstyle typetextcssgt         html, body                      height 100             width 100             padding 0px             margin 0px             backgroundcolor808080                   divnav                      position absolute             height 100             width 150px             top 0             left 0             backgroundcolorC0C0C0                   divcontent                      top 0px             height 100             marginleft 150px             backgroundcolor 2F4F4F                   iframepdf                      width100             height100              ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idnavgt         ltfieldset classlookupFieldsgt             ltdivgt                 ltlabel forbook gtBookltlabelgt                 ltinput typetext idbook size5 gt             ltdivgt             ltdivgt                 ltlabel forpagegtPageltlabelgt                 ltinput typetext idpage size5 gt             ltdivgt             ltdivgt                 ltinput typebutton idbtnViewImage valueView gt             ltdivgt         ltfieldsetgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idcontentgt         ltiframe idpdf frameborder0 src065000012.pdfgtltiframegt     ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThanksp  pdblp

Negative 64900 pI have two directory structures on a USB drive that have various files that are the same, and each have files that the other one doesnt.p  pWhat I want to do is to move over directory structure B to A. It is ok that Bs content is gone after the merge. Directories in A must not be erased, because otherwise I lose As content. The mv command wont work I think, because it will complain that it cant move a directory because a destination directory in the same place is not empty. mv B A wont work either because some sub directory will also not be empty. cp a B A is bad even with u, because it will take way too long, because the files are on a USB drive, and there possibly too many of them, making the drive run out of capacity. rsync has the same problem, because it doesnt appear to have a moverename feature, and it can only move files by copying them.p  pSo either, Im going to have to write a script that will recursively run through B, and create missing directories and move missing files to A. But Im hoping that there is a command or option or utility that I dont know about.p

Negative 64900 pMy question is regarding credit card readers configured in Keyboard mode under OS X. Ive noticed that the same reader running under OS X Im running 10.9.4, but the same holds true for previous versions reads out swipe data about twice as fast in Windows 7 as it does on the Mac. For example, if I swipe a card using my MagTek Dynamag reader in to Text Edit or any app on the Mac, it can take a good 45 seconds to fully output the track data the track is quite long because its encrypted. If I run the same swipe using the same computer and reader using my VMWare Fusion Windows 7 virtual machine, the swipe outputs in a text file in about half the time 23 seconds. Even with whatever overhead is introduced by running a virtual machine, the output rate is still MUCH faster under Windows.p  pI originally just thought it was the reader that was slow until I tested it in Windows. Does anyone know what is causing the slower output rate on the Mac Is it merely a setting or something more involved such as USB drivers Thanks for any helpp

Negative 64900 pIm using TFS 2013 to build many solutions each with different solution configurations.  Im also transforming web.config based on the build definition process setting.

This returns a codeForumDispatchcode resource.li licodeForumDispatch.getitem1code is called. The database is queried for a Forum with ID 1. If it is not found, a codeKeyErrorcode is raised. If it is found, a codeForumcode object is returned, and view lookup begins with codeForumcode as a context.li ol  pHeres how the traversal would work for the second URLp  ol liA codeRootcode resource is createdli licodeRoot.getitemforumcode is called. This returns a codeForumDispatchcode resource.li licodeForumDispatch.getitem1code is called. The database is queried for a codeForumcode with ID 1. If it is not found, a codeKeyErrorcode is raised. If it is found, a codeForumcode object is returned.li licodeForum.getitemthreadscode is called. A codeThreadsDispatchcode object is returnedli licodeThreadsDispatch.getitem1code is called. The database is queried for a codeThreadcode 1 in codeForumcode 1. If it is found, a codeThreadcode object is returned and view lookup begins, or a codeKeyErrorcode is raised.li ol  pNow, for the first URL, a single query is issued. It would look like codeSELECT ... FROM forums WHERE forums.id  1code. In the second URL, two queries are issued. codeSELECT ... FROM forums WHERE forums.id  1code, and codeSELECT ... FROM threads WHERE thread.id  1 AND forum.id  1code.p  pI dont want two queries to be issued. For the second URL, the query codeSELECT ... FROM forums LEFT JOIN threads ON threads.forumid  forums.id WHERE threads.id  1 AND forums.id  1code would return all the information needed. Then, I could return a KeyError if no rows are returned, or if a codeForumcode is returned but not a codeThreadcode.p  pIn order to accomplish this, the codeForumDispatch.getitemcode needs to behave differently e.g. change the query, or dont query at all if it knows that threads is also going to be called next.p  pIs there any way to accomplish thisp  pI could, instead of returning actual database objects, create dummy resources to be returned by codeForumDispatch.getitemcode and the like, and then have the view perform the necessary query. But, I feel like Im losing out on some of the traversal functionality by making the view worry about queryingraising 404 errors. Thoughtsp

But as it turns out, this code actually treats each tile as if it were a square, not a diamond. p  pThe next weird part is that when my mouse passes over the center of the tile, the tile changes. So what should happen, is that my mouse should go over the edge of the tile, and then it changes to the next one. But instead, it acts as if the center of tile is actually the edge.p  pBut really, all I want is the equation that will cause my mouse to work like this a hrefhttpwww.tonypa.pri.eetbwtut18.html relnofollowhttpwww.tonypa.pri.eetbwtut18.htmlap  pOn that link, click the Click Here to Start Button, and watch how the mouse interacts with the tiles.

Negative 64900 pThe full version of this question is quoted belowp  blockquote   pLet G be a connected graph with n vertices, m edges with distinct edge   weights. Let T be a tree of G with n vertices and n1 edges i.e. a   spanning tree, and define a bottleneck edge of T to be the edge of T   with the smallest weight. The maxbottleneck tree is a spanning tree   of G if there is no spanning tree with larger bottleneck edge. Prove   or provide a counter example for the  following statementp      pEvery maxspanning tree of G is a max bottleneck tree of Gp blockquote  pI think since the graph has unique edge weights, then every spanning tree of G is also unique. Then there is only one maximum spanning tree of G, and if I can prove that this tree is also a max bottle neck tree, then that would prove this statement to be true, but only if its true for all graphs that have unique edge weights.p  pIve tried looking for counter examples to prove this false but so far it looks like every graph I draw with unique edge weights winds up have the max spanning tree also be a max bottleneck tree. I think I can use that to prove that this statement is true, but I am not sure how to word it.p

Negative 64900 pI have to write a stack crawlertraceback code. I am installing my own sigsegv handler. All works fine as long as my traceback is not called from another handler.p  pMore precisely, if my traceback is called from another handler lets say for SIGALRM where that handler blocks all other signals , my handler for sigsegv does not get invoked. I understand that this is be because of the previous handler blocking all other signals please correct me if i am wrong. I want to understand, if my handler for sigsegv will even be installed or not Because even though the my handler is not invoked the pending bit for sigsegv should be set for that process and once the current handler for SIGALRM finishes at least that time my handler should be invoked.p  pAlso, is there a way to I can ensure that SIGSEGV will be caught in this case where traceback is being called from another handler which has blocked that signal.p  pThanks.p

Negative 64900 pWe are using Jersey ServerSent Events SSE to allow remote components of our application to listen to events raised by our JerseyTomcat server. This works great.p  pHowever, it is crucial that our server have an accurate list of currentlyconnected listeners our remote components. To this end, our server sends a tiny message to each caller via eventOutput.write once every five seconds. If our remote component is shut down while SSEconnected, or if the remote computer is powered off while SSEconnected, our servers eventOutput.write throws the ClientAbortExceptionSocketException exception shown below. Thats perfect we catch the exception, mark that caller as no longer connected, and move on.p  pNow, for the problem. As I mentioned, eventOutput.write throws an exception in cases where our remote component software is not running, or where the computer it runs on has been powered down. However, there are two cases where calling eventOutput.write to a nolongerconnected computer does NOT throw an exception 1 if the Ethernet cable of the remote computer is simply pulled while the caller is SSEconnected, and 2 if the network adapter in the remote computer is turned off i.e., by an administrative action while the caller is SSEconnected. In these two cases, we can call eventOutput.write to the remote computer every five seconds for hours and no exception is thrown. This makes it impossible to detect that the remote computer is no longer connected.p  pI see that EventOutput and ChunkedOutput has very few methods and properties, but I wonder if there is any way to configure or use it that will cause an exception to be thrown when writing to a remote computer that has been disconnected by having its Ethernet cable pulled or network adapter turned off.p  pAnd here is the gooduseful exception we get in cases where eventOutput.write DOES throw the exception we wantp  precodeorg.apache.catalina.connector.ClientAbortException null     at org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.doFlushOutputBuffer.java371 [catalina.jar7.0.53]     at org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.flushOutputBuffer.java333 [catalina.jar7.0.53]     at org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteOutputStream.flushCoyoteOutputStream.java101 [catalina.jar7.0.53]     at org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.internal.ResponseWriterNonCloseableOutputStreamWrapper.flushResponseWriter.java303 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at org.glassfish.jersey.message.internal.CommittingOutputStream.flushCommittingOutputStream.java292 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ChunkedOutput1.callChunkedOutput.java240 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ChunkedOutput1.callChunkedOutput.java190 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.processErrors.java315 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.processErrors.java242 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at org.glassfish.jersey.process.internal.RequestScope.runInScopeRequestScope.java347 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ChunkedOutput.flushQueueChunkedOutput.java190 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ChunkedOutput.writeChunkedOutput.java180 [jaxrsri2.13.jar2.13.]     at com.appserver.webservice.AgentSsePollingManagerConnectionChecker.runAgentSsePollingManager.java174 [AgentSsePollingManagerConnectionChecker.classna]     at java.util.concurrent.ExecutorsRunnableAdapter.callExecutors.java471 [na1.7.071]     at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runAndResetFutureTask.java304 [na1.7.071]     at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorScheduledFutureTask.access301ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java178 [na1.7.071]     at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorScheduledFutureTask.runScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java293 [na1.7.071]     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorkerThreadPoolExecutor.java1145 [na1.7.071]     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runThreadPoolExecutor.java615 [na1.7.071]     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java745 [na1.7.071] Caused by java.net.SocketException Broken pipe     at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0Native Method [na1.7.071]     at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWriteSocketOutputStream.java113 [na1.7.071]     at java.net.SocketOutputStream.writeSocketOutputStream.java159 [na1.7.071]     at org.apache.coyote.http11.InternalOutputBuffer.realWriteBytesInternalOutputBuffer.java215 [tomcatcoyote.jar7.0.53]     at org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.ByteChunk.flushBufferByteChunk.java480 [tomcatcoyote.jar7.0.53]     at org.apache.coyote.http11.InternalOutputBuffer.flushInternalOutputBuffer.java119 [tomcatcoyote.jar7.0.53]     at org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractHttp11Processor.actionAbstractHttp11Processor.java799 [tomcatcoyote.jar7.0.53]     at org.apache.coyote.Response.actionResponse.java174 [tomcatcoyote.jar7.0.53]     at org.apache.catalina.connector.OutputBuffer.doFlushOutputBuffer.java366 [catalina.jar7.0.53]     ... 19 common frames omitted codepre

So, dont know which part to post.p  pAny help, links or suggestions are welcome.p  pThanks.p

Negative 64900 pIm using RabbitMQ and need to send some messages to the queue. So if I send just a single message it works fine. But I need to test how it works if I have lots of the messages sent at the same time, so I created a simple app that sends messages using multithreading. The function for sending the messages is absolutely the same as the one used in the case when I send just a single message, the only difference is that now I call this function in Task. And I get the error message once I run my app. It says Additional information None of the specified endpoints were reachable in the line    using var connection  factory.CreateConnectionp  pAnd these are the initial lines where I send the messasgep  precodevar factory  new ConnectionFactory   HostName  Constants.RabbitQueueHostName , Port  AmqpTcpEndpoint.UseDefaultPort   using var connection  factory.CreateConnection using var channel  connection.CreateModel ... codepre  pSo its a kinda weird.

Negative 64900 pIn my app I use a toolbar on the top because it lays out bar button items better for what I need, and I set the toolbars delegate to the view controller and tell it to be top attached. I also have a setting that will hide the status bar, so the issue that is happening is that when the status bar is set to hidden, and the app is closed and then reopened, positionForBar is called but since there is no status bar, it doesnt do anything to the toolbar, so when I turn the status bar back on the app looks strange, and the toolbar is 20px down, and the status bar is showing but there is no background to the status bar, so it looks strange. positionForBar is being called still though but for some reason I need to close the app again before the toolbar will draw behind the status bar again. I have found out that if I remove the toolbar from the superview and readd it again, it will draw behind the status bar, or i can remove positionForBar and have my own view be the background for the status bar, my old issue with this solution is that it wont be transparent I could maybe put a 20px toolbar there though maybe and my problem with removing it and readding the view is then I will need to move a ton of my code around because remove it and readding it messes with constraints so I will need to fully reconstruct the entire view just for it to redraw behind the status bar. Is there a way to just refresh the view or something I have tried setNeedsLayout and setNeedsDisplay and nothing really works for it to redraw besides removing and readdingp

Negative 64900 pIm currently trying to find a way to resample vectors.

Negative 64900 pI am developing a 2D game. My own monitor is 1080p, so the GUI is based on a monitor that is 1080p. This causes the GUI to look bad whenever the monitor has a resolution that is smaller then 1080p.

Negative 64900 pFor my assignment, I have to solve a simplified Conways problem using lightweight processes and constant size buffers. The program reads a stream of characters, packages the stream into 10character blocks, and write them as 24character lines. The pound sign  character will be used as an endofdata EOD sentinel value. We have to implement the following changesp  pAfter every block an extra blank is inserted.p  pEvery adjacent pair of asterisks is replaced by an exclamation point.

Negative 64900 pI have a java restful webservice program thats hosted on tomcat. In one of my web service methods, I load a big arraylist of objects about 25,000 entries from redis.

When, I update the arraylist I want to cause minimum disruptiondelays since there could be other threads reading from it. p  pI was wondering what is the best way to do this One way is to use synchronized keyword to the method that updates the list.

Negative 64900 h1Backgroundh1  pBack in the day when I did C programing we used assume statements to make sure the code was healthy. Something likep  precodeaFunctionint hello    assumehello lt 10 codepre  pThe cool thing about the assume statement is it was defined to be an empty macro for release compiling and a die on false statement on debug compiling. So the developer had all the benefits of an assert statement checking their assumptions without causing unnecessary bugs or affecting performance in p  h1Problemh1  pNow that Im working php Im looking for a similar mechanism. I currently have my assume statement looking something like thisp  precodedefineDEBUG, getenvdebug function assumea    if DEBUG ampamp a        echo ASSUME FAILURE ltbr gt     echo ltpregt     printrdebugbacktrace     dieltpregt     assumea  b codepre  pAs you can see I set the debug flag in the server settings to remove the actual die statement and such. However a function call is still performed and an if statement is still evaluated. This is not a big deal if it only occurs a few thousand times but as the code gets bigger and as these assumes get put into loops this could have a legitimate affect on performance.p  h1Questionh1  pIs there a way to tell the interpreter or opcache Im currently using zend opcache included in php 5.5 to ignore these assume statements altogether or is there another method of handling this problemp

Negative 64900 pGiven a JSP page, and some object bound to a request attribute called foo, I can refer to foo withp  precodefoo codepre  pIf the value of foo has a bean property called, say, type, and the type of type is some codeenumcode class, then to make comparisons I would use a stringp  precodeltcif testfoo.type  WHATEVERgt codepre  pThen assuming that one of the constants in my codeenumcode class has the name WHATEVER, that comparison should work, and produce either codetruecode or codefalsecode.p  pNow what Im wondering is how exactly that comparison is supposed to be carried out by the servlet container. Some Oracle documentation a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE19226018207627gjddd relnofollowherea suggests vaguely that what happens is that the string constant is converted to the codeenumcode type, and then the comparison is made.p  pIm investigating a situation involving code that I emthinkem works differently between JettyTomcat ie, Apache and Resin.  The Apache world seems to be doing the right thing, or at least the thing that Id expect according to that documentation from Oracle.p  pWhat I fear is that another property of my codeenumcode may be causing the Resin implementation to do something different. Specifically, my codeenumcode class has a code.toStringcode implementation that returns a different string than that returned by code.namecode.  That quirk causes no problems in an Apache server, or at least none that Ive ever seen. If Resin implements the comparison by converting the enum constant to a string via code.toStringcode, not code.namecode instead of converting the string to the codeenumcode type, then things wont work consistently.p  pNote that in all other respects Im having no issues with using my codeenumcode types lots of them are like this in various other ways in JSPJSTLEL. There are in fact only a small number of places where theres EL logic in the JSP, because the application does most of its work via clientside template rendering.p  pemeditem mdash Im pretty sure I confirmed that Resin does the comparisons differently, though I dont know exactly what that is. I have for reasons I dont recall a name EL function in my own EL function library, so I can use that to work around the problem.p

Negative 64900 pFor the a hrefhttpsaddons.mozilla.orgfirefoxaddonslyzoom relnofollowSlyZoom extensiona I have created, I want to implement a virtual slider a XULXBL element that acts as a small static region where, on codemousedowncode, the mouse pointer changes to codeewresizecode and I capture codemousemovecode events to detect horizontal movement, to change the current zoom level.p  pSo far I have implemented a tentative solution, using the standard a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgdocsWebAPIMouseEvent relnofollowMouseEvent APIa and utilizing the very handy a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgdocsWebAPIMouseEventmovementX relnofollowMouseEvent.mozMovementXa, that seem to be present even when Im not using the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgdocsWebAPIPointerLockAPI relnofollowPointer Lock APIa.p  pIn this example image you see the Xubuntu codeewresizecode mouse pointer over the provisional virtual slider, which is the region, with the small black double arrow behind the mouse pointer, on the left side of the codeltmenulistgtcodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrh22B.png altVirtual slider examplep  pemThe right side of this image is the right edge of the screen the left side is simply cropped.emp  pHowever, as you can seeimagine, it is very likely that the mouse pointer will regularly reach the edge of users screens before theyve reached a satisfactory zoom level. In those cases, unfortunately, codeMouseEvent.mozMovementXcode will simply stay zero, even though the physical pointer device is still moving.p  pIve tried to circumvent this by using the Pointer Lock API. However, it appears as though the Pointer Lock API does not work for XULXBL documents. Is that correct Or is the Pointer Lock API supposed to work for XULXBL documents as wellp  pIn any case, even if the Pointer Lock API emwasem working for my XBL element, it would hide the mouse pointer, and that is not desirable. Although I guess I could try to create a faux mouse pointer in that case, but that is rather cumbersome and prone to erratic behavior, Im afraid.p  pSo my question boils down to thisp  pHow can I properly detect mousemove deltas beyond screen edges in XULXBL documents Is this possible, somehowp

Negative 64900 pI would love to get some help with my menu. Ive added simple accordion menu to my site, but i need to do one trick. Menu has Products title text and arrow to show that product has more submenus. I would like to separate those fields   when i click on Products text it will take me to the linked page  when i click on rest of Products field menu will collapse showing subcategories.

Negative 64900 pIve been searching for the best languagetranslation plugin for Wordpress on and off for a while and this morning I thought in Polylang Id found it.  It seems to be sensibly organised and has useful features allowing you to automatically moves pages and I assumed posts into the default language for the blog when you activate it.p  pHowever my joy was short lived  activating Polylang on a multisite wordpress install also renders all of my blog posts invisible  pages are still there and can be assigned to language specific portionsmenus of the site  so structurally its fine but my blog is gone until I disable the plugin.  There are a few mentions of this happening on other fora but nothing canonical in terms of an explanation.  Any cluesp

Negative 64900 pIm using spring social 1.1.2 and I would like to redirect the users to a specific page after the authentication with the provider.p  pSince SocialAuthenticationFilter reacts to authfacebook, I was expecting to be able to add a request param like authfacebookid123, but the spring filter react as a rejected authentication.p  pIs there any way to receive back a param in the redirecturl from the provider p  pMaybe its just conceptually wrong because this approach should be used for the login process on the application and the redirecturl should be constant..p  pUnfortunately, the login page is expecting a param to identify the area on witch the user wants to login. I would prefer not to use cookiessession because there is no guarantees that the WHATEVERPARAMKEY get overridden before the user click confirm on the social provider for example he tries to login to a different area of the app.p  pIs there any way to carry information across the authentication process with the social providerp

Negative 64900 pI have a public server with web services .Net that collect data and uploaded files from different mobile apps and I need to synchronise it with an internal intranet server.p  pThe intranet server is deeply protected by firewall and organisation policies.p  pI think this is a pretty common scenario where messages and brokers could be used, something like Rabbitmq or Nservicebus, but Im not an expert on it.p  pAs the data is only to be sent from the external server to the intranet one in unidirectional and asynchronous way I was thinking not to add another layer of indirection to the architecture and just use the web services exposed also for server to server communication.p  pThe approach would be likep  ol liAn intranet windows serivce  would poll regularly and at different scheduled intervals the external web service to know if there is new data to get maybe from a certain point in timeli liThe web service would respond with the list of the new data and filesli liThe windows service would iterate with calls to get all the data to be inserted in the intranet and download the uploaded files.li ol  pWhat are the risks of this approach Would be better that the external web service would respond only a link to a huge zipped file response with all the data and files in itp  pShould I use a something like RabbitMq also for a so simple scenariop

Negative 64900 pI created a typeahead search field in my meteor app using codesergeyttypeaheadcode. p  pNow I want to log all search requests to know which informations are missing in my database. The thing is, that the users maybe wont press enter. Because of the typeaheadfunction the user will type some characters and if there is no result, they maybe abort typing. Some of the users will delete the input to try another keyword. I would like to get those informations, if it is technically possible.p  pSo first of all I have to check how many results typeahead gives me, but I dont know where to get this information.p  pThis is my code so farp  precodeTemplate.search.helpers     searchData function          return [                              name cat1,                 valueKey title,                 displayKey title,                 header lth3 classcategorynamegtCategory 1lth3gt,                 template searchResults,                 local function  return Collection.find.fetch                       ]     ,     selected functionevent, suggestion          if Router.routes[suggestion.type]  void 0              console.warnRoute not found             return                  else Router.gosuggestion.type,  id  suggestion.id        codepre  pI would start with a event for that templatep  precodeTemplate.search.events     submit form functionevent, template          event.preventDefault         var newElement  template.firstNode.children[0][1].value         Log.insert title newElement, missing true      ,     keyup input functionevent, template          var keyword  event.target.value         Log.insert title keyword        codepre  ol lipsubmitevent So if the user presses enter, the keyword will be saved to the collection. But this is quite bad, because this should just happen if there is no typeaheadresult, as the user can select a suggestion and then press the enter key to go for that result, but with my code this would be overwritten...pli lipkeyupevent Problem with this is, that every keyevent will be tracked. For typing just searching, there would be 14 inserts to the collection. Thats not what I want. If Im using the change event, the input has to get a blur and thats also not what I need.pli ol  pSo this seems to me not to be the best way.p  pMaybe it is possible to use the custom events of typeahead.js, like codetypeaheadrendercode. p
