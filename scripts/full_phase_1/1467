Im not fussy I just need to be able to style them differently so if I am able to get the titlenameslug of the parent instead of just the id or if I can add a css class to the parent or child to separate them or any other suggestion,  Im open to all. I have spent a fair amount of time searching for explanations on the usage of parent child terms but nothing out there. Ive, through trial and error, tried many different code snippets but most would work with a postcategory taxonomy but not attribute terms. I think its because the terms arent actually s taxonomy but a meta if the attribute.

Negative 1467 pIt seems that the choice to use string parsing vs. regular expressions comes up on a regular basis for me anytime a situation arises that I need part of a string, information about said string, etc.p  pThe reason that this comes up is that were evaluating a soap headers action, strongafterstrong it has been parsed into something manageable via the OperationContext object for WCF and emthenem making decisions on that.

Negative 1467 pI have a program that segfaults from pointer arithmetic sometimes. I know this happens, but I cant easily check ahead of time to see whether it segfaults or not  either I can prescan input data to see if it will cause a segfault which can be impossible to determine, or I can refit it to not use pointer arithmetic, which would require a significantly larger amount of work, or I can try to catch a segfault. So my questionp  p1 How, in C, can I catch a segfault I know emsomethingem in the OS causes a segfault, but what can a C program do in the event that it segfaults to die a bit more gracefully than just codeSegmentation faultcodep  p2 How portable is thisp  pI imagine this is a highly unportable behavior, so if you post any code to catch a segfault, please tell me what it works on. Im on Mac OS X but Id like my program to work on as many platforms as it can and I want to see what my options are.p  pAnd dont worry  basically all I want to do is print a more userfriendly error message and free some codemalloccodeed memory, and then die.

Negative 1467 pI am working on an application that uses Oracles built in authentication mechanisms to manage user accounts and passwords. The application also uses row level security. Basically every user that registers through the application gets an Oracle username and password instead of the typical entry in a USERS table. The users also receive labels on certain tables. This type of functionality requires that the execution of DML and DDL statements be combined in many instances, but this poses a problem because the DDL statements perform implicit commits. If an error occurs after a DDL statement has executed, the transaction management will not roll everything back. For example, when a new user registers with the system the following might take placep  ol liStart transactionli liInsert person details into a table. i.e. first name, last name, etc. DMLli liCreate an oracle account create user testuser identified by password DDL implicit commit. Transaction ends.li liNew transaction begins.li liPerform more DML statments inserts,updates,etc.li liError occurs, transaction only rolls back to step 4.li ol  pI understand that the above logic is working as designed, but Im finding it difficult to unit test this type of functionality and manage it in data access layer. I have had the database go down or errors occur during the unit tests that caused the test schema to be contaminated with test data that should have been rolled back. Its easy enough to wipe the test schema when this happens, but Im worried about database failures in a production environment. Im looking for strategies to manage this.p  pThis is a JavaSpring application. Spring is providing the transaction management.p

Negative 1467 pImagine there is a strongvery very large roomstrong in the shape of a hollow cube. There are magic balls hanging in the air at fixed discrete positions of the room. No magic ball has another one exactly above it. If we take an strongimaginary horizontal plane of infinite areastrong and pass through the cube, how can we be sure that the plane doesnt cut through any of the magic balls p  pThe height of a magic ball is given as a function of its position x and y. The distribution is such a way that some balls are at the same height while other are at different heights. Let the function bebr           codez  axy  bx  cycodebr  where a,b,c are positive integer constants. The positions xaxis and yaxis values and also the height z are discrete values for simplicity, we can consider them positive integers.p  pemIf the ball distribution function was z10xy8x4y, then it is impossible to have a z value of 15 or 21. So a plane at z15 or z21 would not cut any of the balls In fact, in this case, any plane with a height z  any odd number would not cut through the balls. It is noticeable that there a some planes with height as even numbers that donot cut through the balls.emp  pWe do not want to find the heights of  all the magic balls and compare it with the height of the horizontal plane, as that would be like trying all the possible combinations and would take very long time even on a computer.p  pOur aim is to find a fast method by which we can tell whether a given value of z height can be produced by any pair of x,y positions.strongIf a given z cannot be produced, then a plane at that height doesnt cut through any ballsstrong The question is also similar to finding whether a given number is present in a sequence produced by a function of two variables.p  pIt would a great help if U could give me any suggestions to solve this problem. Thank You. I have already tried evolutionary computing like GA,PSO,DE,SA etc. The method needs to be deterministic.p

Arrays   can contain up to around 10,000   elements before they are put on the   large object heap and can cause   problems, so a very effective way to   store 100,000 entries might be to   store 10 arrays each containing 10,000   elements none will end up on the   large object heap so no fragmentation   will occur.

Negative 1467 pstrongProblemstrongp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2318390windowsmobiledirectdrawrotatevideostreamhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2318390windowsmobiledirectdrawrotatevideostreamap  pThe video preview is working, all I need now is a way to rotate the image. I think the only way to handle this is to write a custom filter based on codeCTransformFiltercode that will rotate the camera image for you. If you can help me to solve this problem, e.g. by helping me to develop this filter with my limited DirectDraw knowledge, the bounty is yours.p  pstrongBackground  Previous questionstrongp  pIm currently developing an application for a mobile device HTC HD2, Windows Mobile 6. One of things the program needs to do is to take pictures using the builtin camera. Previously I did this with the codeCameraCaptureDialogcode offered by the Windows Mobile 6 SDK, but our customer wants a more userfriendly solution.p  pThe idea is to preview the cameras video stream in a control and take a high resolution picture  2 megapixels using the cameras photo function, when the control is clicked. We did some research on the topic and found out the best way to accomplish this seems to be using Direct Draw.p  pThe downsides are that I never really used any native windows API and that my C is rather bad. In addition to this I read somewhere that the Direct Draw support of HTC phones is particularity bad and you will have to use undocumented native HTC libraries calls to take high quality pictures. p  pThe good news is that a company offered us to develop a control that meets the specifications stated above. They estimated it would take them about 10 days, which lead to the discussion if we could develop this control ourself within a reasonable amount of time.p  pIts now my job to research which alternative is better. Needless to say its far too less time to study the whole a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms940077.aspx relnofollowarchitecturea and develop a demo, which lead me to the following questionsp  pemQuestions no longer relevantemp  ul liDoes any of you have experience with similar projects What are your recommendationsli liIs there a good Direct Draw source code example that deals with video preview and image capturingli ul

Negative 1467 pSo I have a problem that I can not figure out. I am writing some code in C. I kept winding up with issues where reading from the network would seemly randomly work.p  pI finally traced it down to the number of strings in the code. I cant believe it but I have verified it pretty in depth. p  pThe code base is rather massive so I am not sure of the overall number of strings parity. However I know that if i add an odd number then the program works, and if i add an even number it doesnt.p  pJust to clarify when I say it doesnt work, It does still build and execute, but everytime I try to read anything over the network all i get is 0s. When its working I get the correct data.p  phas anyone ever heard of anything like this Or have any idea what could be causing this I could see if the data portion of the program was getting too large and starting to impede on other codes space but the fact that its an oddeven thing completely confuses me.p  pthanks p  pEDIT Adding more infop  pThe platform is a custom designed device. the code base is redboot but its been altered significantly for the custom device.p  psnipped for examplep  pThis will work because its an odd number of strings. p  precodechar str1  test char str2  test2 char str3  test3  int i  strlenstr1  strlenstr2  strlenstr3 codepre  p......................................p  pif i were to change the last line to p  precodeint i  strlenstr1  strlen2 codepre  pso that str3 gets optimized out by the compiler then the code will no longer work. I have tested this many times with various lenghts of strings all result in the same oddeven behavior.  i is just sent to a debug log so that its not optimized out. nothing fancy is done with it.p  pEdit2  The above code can be placed anywhere in the codebase and it causes the same problem. It doesnt matter if its been executed or not, which leads me to believe its not a stack overflow. p

I designed a database with a bunch of tables that  have many to many relationships, similar to the followingp  pGrandParent  many to many  Parent p  pandp  pParent  many to many  Childp  pI used the Entity Framework to make all of the entities class and am now working on a function in a repository class which adds a GrandParent.p  pIt tries to create Child, add it to a Parent, then add the parent to a GrandParent and then add the GrandParent to the database by using the commandp  precodeentities.GrandParents.AddObjectnewGrandParent entities.SaveChanges codepre  pIt crashes on the codeSaveChangescode line with the errorp  blockquote   pUnable to update the EntitySet   JunctionPartentsChilds because it   has a DefiningQuery and no    element exists in the   ModificationFunctionMapping element to   support the current operation.p blockquote  pEDIT I can fix that error by deleting all of the DefiningQuery elements in the auto generated code and now Im getting an error on the same line that should be more descriptive but Im still at a loss. p  pThe error is codeInvalid object name JunctionPartentsChildscode and it throws a UpdatingException.p  pAny ideas whats going wrong Do you have to add to the database in a special order because of the many to many relationshipsp  pThanksp

Negative 1467 pIm not doing much new development right now, but a lot of refactoring of older C subsystems whose original requirements no longer support new and Ill add unexpected requirements. Im also now using Rhino Mocks and unit tests where possible vs 2008.p  pThe dilemma for me is that to make the methods testable and mockable, I need to define clear contracts using interfaces. However, if I do this, a lot of the global data that many of the classes use turns into tramp data, passed from method to method until it gets to its intended user this looks ugly, and is against my sensibilities, but ... can be mocked. Making a mixed bag class with a lot of static global properties is a more attractive option but not Rhino testable. Is there a middle ground between the two Testable but not too trampy Pattern perhapsp  pYou should also understand that these applications run on an inhouse corporate developed platform, so there are a lot of helper classes and services that are instantiated once per application, and then are used throughout the application, for example a database accessor helper class. Another example is using configuration files that are read once, and used throughout the application by different methods for various reasons.p  pYour thoughts appreciated.p

Negative 1467 pIs it possible to completely emulate the behavior of a GridLayout with the GridBagLayout managerp  pBasically, I have a 8x8 grid in which each cell should have the same width and height. The GridLayout automatically did this. But I want to add another row and column to the grid which size is emnot the sameem as the other ones. That rowcolumn should take up all the remaining space that might be left over because the available size couldnt be equally distributed into 8 cells. Is that even possible, or do I  again  have to use a different layout managerp  h3edith3  pHere is a simple graphic of what I want to achieve, simplified to just 4 cells img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGDApY.png altProblem graphicp  pThe colored cells are the ones I added to the actual grid gray which has cells with the same height and width codexcode. So the grids height and width is code4xcode.

Negative 1467 pI have something minor, yet very odd happening in SQL Server Management Studio 2005. I have 2 database catalogs which are essentially identical. There is a Market table with a foreign key to other several other tables for example the Project table has a MarketID column with an FK reference from dbo.Market. in both db catalogs the MarketID is not null, the datatype is the same int  obviously and in both db catalogs there is a foreign key created between the two tables from dbo.Market to dbo.Project.p  pon the PRD catalog if I right click the Market table and choose View Dependencies from the context menu I will see the tables where MarketId is a foreign key on other tables e.g. dbo.Project will appear under Objects that depend upon Market. If I do the same thing on the other db catalog TST it does not show that there are any foreign keys. PRD and TST catalogs are hosted on the same db server, so its not a case of one catalog has a different version or SP of SS Management Studio or something... what givesp  pWhat is even more strange is if I create a database diagram on both catalogs, the foreign keys look the same for all the tables compared, but the behaviour of the View Dependencies is different. If I look at the Indexes and Statistics for the tables on each catalog they are essentially identical too... I am baffled.p  pCan anyone suggest what things would impact the visibility of foreign key relationships in the tree that is shown when you choose the View Dependenciesp  pInitially we thought wtf who removed the foreign keys, but when we look at a data diagram or the foreign keys folder they are there...p

Negative 1467 pstrongThe short questionstrongbr  Does Castle Windsor have something similar to Spring.Nets Lookup Method Injection that can be configured from XML, which provides the ability to fetch transient instances from the container without the class being aware of the IoC containerp  pstrongThe long questionstrongbr  Im a long time SpringSpring.Net user and I have been experimenting with Castle Windsor, by trying to port a project over to it. Spring.Net has a concept of Lookup Method Injection which from the Spring docs...p  blockquote   pLookup method injection is the ability of the container to override methods on container managed objects, to return the result of looking up another named object in the container. The lookup typically involves a prototype object as in the scenario described in the preceding section. The Spring framework implements this method injection by a dynamically generating a subclass overriding the method using the classes in the System.Reflection.Emit namespace.p blockquote  pWhat this means is, If I had the following...p  precodepublic class SomeTransient       ... I have dependencies that need to be filled by IoC container   public class SomeClass      public virtual void Work              var o  CreateTransient           public virtual SomeTransient CreateTransient    codepre  pI can instruct Spring to override the CreateTransient method, and have that method return a new container created transient instance with its dependencies initialized each time the method is called. The unique part of this is, it doesnt require direct links to the Spring Framework eg. SomeClass doesnt have to implement a specific interface.p  pIs there something similar in Castle Windsor to accomplish this via XMLp  pI will eventually move away from XML config, but at the moment Im just trying to get it runningp
Negative 1467 pUsing the Microsoft.Samples.ReportingServices.ReportViewer, I am showing multiple instances of the same SRS report on the same aspx page using IFrames which is what the ReportViewer renders as. Each instance has different parameters passed to it, so the output looks different on each instance of the report.p  pMy issue is that in Internet Explorer, the same graphic is showing up for each report because IE is caching the image the URL for each image representation of the report is the same URL, so IE assumes it should just show the same image over and over since its all in on the same page though separated by IFrames.p  pFirefox behaves correctly.

Negative 1467 pA class design guideline found in SutterampAlexandrescus coding standards book, among others, is to make base classes abstract, such that one cannot instantiate them. This is to prevent a.o. slicing and problems with polymorphic assignment and copying.p  pHowever, when using a class library like e.g. Qt, it is common practice to inherit from concrdete classes from the library to add additional behavior. For example one would create a class MyListBox which inherits from QListBox, adding applicationspecific behavior for all list boxes in my application.  p  pHow is can this common practice be reconciled with the advice to have noninstantiatiable base classes p

Negative 1467 pmy application uses the standard app.config to store the public configuration data. However, there are still some other data which are not public, but they still must be accessible all the time, persistent, changeable from out of the application as well as manually in case of some problems.p  pFor example imagine that the application stores some licensing information within a file which must not be public available. However, an administrator must be able to edit this file using notepad or similar without any special editors, so cryptography is out of the game.p  pWould you use isolated storage Do you have some other suggestions Since the application is not using any database, please do not consider storing withing a DB as an option, too.p  pSo the question is how to store application data so that it is not as easy to modify by hand as with app.config, but still easily editable for a power user.p

I understand the resolution that is given in the error, but we want to have the same message for a number of different operations.p  pThoughtsp  pMore Info We implement an event pubsub mechanism. Event subscribers declare a service operation with the event type they want to handle and wrap that in a generic message contract class. This generic message class uses the message code attributes to use the eventpublisher xml names  which is a single message structure. All event subscribers are registered in UDDI and the pubsub mechanism use those endpoints to push events to the subscribers. Registration of service operations in UDDI detect the specific eventnamespace to register those service operations as event handlers and not reqresponse operations.p

Ive looked at some pInvoke stuff but I would rather not go down that road if .NET is an option. p  pIs there a way to detect and handle a shutdown in these situations I am open to any .NET, pInvokeWin32CC solution. Basically any way it can be done on the Windows platform.p  pThanks.p  pP.S. Im still working with .NET 2.0 so I cant use anything introduced in .NET 3.0p
Negative 1467 pI want to use UITableViewCells within my application which have an image, and that image is downloaded asynchronously. Too accomplish that and to make sure that I dont have to write the same code several times within my application I subclassed UITableViewCell like sop  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  interface ImageCell  UITableViewCell      UIImageView imageView   property nonatomic, retain UIImageView imageView  end codepre  pEverytime I need a Cell with an image I would like to subclass the ImageCell like sop  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import ImageCell.h  interface StoreCell  ImageCell       UILabel streetAddress     UILabel retailerName     UILabel distance   property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UILabel streetAddress property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UILabel retailerName property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UILabel distance  end codepre  pHowever this doesnt seem to work.

Negative 1467 pIm building a web service based on SAMLP and XACML, which requires a large number of XSDs to be considered by JAXBXJC for each build. This takes forever and is exceedingly unreliable, I think due to W3C throttling XSD requests to ease the load on their servers based on their blog posting.p  pWorse yet, some of the W3C XSDs contain obvious typos, so these must be downloaded and patched, and the schemaLocation of referrring files edited to load the local copies. One of the primary SAMLP schema has this problem a double  and wildly incorrect import addresses.p  pI think there is a way to make Eclipse or JAXB, or something else not sure what would solve this maybe Xerces maintain a cache of XSDs and substitue these for http refs in my build perhaps even systemwide. But Ive not managed to track this down to a workable recipe. Can someone help Thanks p

Negative 1467 pIm trying to develop an application using MS LifeCam Studio webcams to detect and measure positions of several objects.

The code builds fine, a small gui pops up allowing me to select what webcam to use. Then after I select the Studio webcam all I get is a blank window. I think one of the reasons might be that the LifeCam Studio is not supported by openCV, so I need additional libraries for doing video acquisition part. I looked online for similar problems but there seems to be many different answers, such as get VideoInput library, need directshow baseclass no idea how to use or what these are for, Windows SDK, etc.p  pMy question is, does anyone have direct experience using this webcam and know the specific reason why I cant get video from it  Ive tried using 0, 1, 1, CVCAPANY as argument for the cvCaptureFromCAM function but still same result.

Feel free to vote for it, or if if you have an alternate better workaround, post it as a comment to the report.p  hr  pIm building a JTable with a custom table model built extending AbstractTableModel.

The .pdb file is avaialable on the server at the same location as the dll. p  pUpdate I just tried ran the client program on the server machine itself, but still the DebugBreak causes an infinite hanging.

Negative 1467 pWe are using a JTable which displays data along with Status New, Processed, Closed. Each status row has a different color which is achieved by overloading prepareRenderer of JTable.p  pNow we need to sort that table and we are using table.setAutoCreateRowSortertrue to achieve that.

We need to reapply the color to all the rows after this operation based on the status column.p  pI was wondering what could be the best way to achieve that. There are several ways I can think ofp  ol liRepaintRevalidate the table. But simply doing this would not work I think.li liCapture mouseClicked event and identify whether column header was clicked then call prepareRenderer manually and then call repaintrevalidateli liThen I read one of the questions here where in one of the answers was mentioned not to call repaintrevalidate directly, rather change the underlying data model and it will automatically call the above methods.li ol  pI dont know how to go about it.

Negative 1467 pIt seems that it would be extremely handy to be able to filter a diff so that trivial changes are not displayed. I would like to write a regular expression which would be run on the line and then pass it another string that uses the captured arguments to generate a canonical form. If the lines before and after produce the same output, then they would be removed from the diff.p  pFor example, I am working on a PHP code base where a significant number of array accesses are written as codemyarray[mykey]code when they should be codemyarray[mykey]code to prevent issues if a codemykeycode constant is defined. It would be useful to generate a diff where the only change on the line wasnt adding some quotes.p  pI cant change them all at once, as we dont have the resources to test the entire code base, so am fixing this whenever I make a change to a function. How can I achieve this Is there anything else similar to this that I can use to achieve a similar result. For example, a simpler method might be to skip the canonical form and just see if the input is transformed into the output. BTW, I am using Gitp

Since both of these intersection points were calculated to have the same exact value, the sort put them in the wrong orientation.

Negative 1467 pIm reverseengineering a proprietary protocol in order to create a free and open client.

I have not been successful in locating the SSL fingerprint in the program files, and even if I could do this, I dont know anything about Flash and would probably screw something up when binarypatching the program.

This way I wont have to keep adding new columns if the filters change or grow.pli ol  pWhat is the best practice for this situationp

Negative 1467 pIve been working on a tile based map engine for my game project in Xna C. The system, like most others, uses a digit corresponding to a tile in a tileset mapped to a specific position on screen. This works fine, but requires every cell on screen to have a number manually entered. Instead, Ive decided to have level layouts read from a .txt containing the number of each tile in the position it would be ingame, like sop  precode1111 0110 1001 1100 codepre  pWhere 1 is grass and 0 is dirt. Again, Im aware this is a common technique. The code I have written can read each line and set the next position in the first column to the corresponding tile graphic. This is fine, but it does not help with the rest of the map. Ive been searching and cannot find how you would split each number in a row into a separate number, so that the first line would read 0,0  1, 0,1  1, etc, so I can then match the coordinates to the x and y position on the map, and the value to the type of tile. p  pSo what I need is the ability to assign a 2d array corresponding to the current position how many characters left in the file, how many lines down in the .txt file, so I can just run two branched for loops x and y for every tile in the level iep  precodefor x0 xltlevelwidth x      for y0 yltlevelheight y              Row[x].Column[y].Tile  Convert.ToInt32filepos[x,y]       codepre  pI think Im overcomplicating this, so if someone can shed some light on this issue for me it would be greatly appreciated. p
Negative 1467 pI have a Java executable that takes in command line arguments to launch root protected applications on my Linux box. We have separate user accounts that are given sudo access to launch the single Java executable, which the user can then use to launch the root protected apps. My understanding of sudo is that the user assumes the root role during the single call and any subsequent calls thereafter i.e. the calls the Java exec makes to the apps. It works for most of my applications, but only partially works for others. In particular the external applications being launched sometime dont operate correctly and seem to output errors that they cant open files that are read accessible by all. If I run the executable as root, the executable and subsequent apps all run fine, so I know it has something to do w sudo.p  pI can provide more details if necessary but looking if anybody knows if sudo changes environment or runtime issues that Im not aware of.p  pUPDATEp  pThe config files are in readable directories. To test for sure I made the binaries that the Java exec are trying to launch read accessible by all. From my tester account, I then launch the Java exec wo sudo and the app runs fine. I then make just the binaries root protected, and run the Java exec with sudo and the application launch fails and gives me an error likep  precorder Fail to open edtrecorder.cfgp  pThat file and the directory its in are both read accessible by all. p

Negative 1467 pWe have data using DevExpress Grid on a web application, and the users are asking to only export the visible data from the page. At the moment, if we do an export, it exports everything from the grid, whether it is shown on the current page, or on a future page 200 items, 20 pages, showing only page 4, we export everything.p  pWe are using the WritePdfToResponse if its a PDF file as an example and tried using the PdfExportOptions PageRange, but it seems to only work for Pages of the PDF file, not the data... For example, if there are 200 items to display, on the site it shows as 20 pages, but in PDF, it shows up as 4 or 5 pages. If we want only page 4, we get page 4 of the PDF, not of the site... Can this be done Ideally, for PDF, CVS, RTF and XSL... p

Negative 1467 pIm considering the following two approaches to set up a compute grid using Akka 2.0p  pa. have a central Router node know about all Worker nodes i.e. which host and port they are running on, keep track of their status, and assign work to them. Workers know nothing about where the central Router is, they just receive compute requests, compute results and send them back to the sender of the request.p  pOR p  pb. have a central Router node that knows nothing about where all the compute grid Workers are i.e. which host and port they are running on. The Workers all know about the central Router, and they register themselves with the central Router when they start up. Once they register, the Router keeps track of their status up or down, and assigns work to them.p  pClearly the two approaches both have some pros and cons that may better suit different use cases and scenarios. Im interested about which approach the Akka community prefers given the forthcoming Akka 2.1 API In other words, which approach is likely to be more suitable to the Clustering API that Akka 2.1 is going to providep  pI looked through the Akka 2.0 RC2 documentation which does discuss briefly the Clustering features that will arrive in Akka 2.1, but there are not too many specifics released yet. Im hoping to get better insights from the Akka experts in the community.p

Negative 1467 pIve been writing a win32 filesystem library and I decided that rather than use TCHAR, I wanted to write a template header only library that would work on charwchart irrespective of compiler widenarrow options.p  pThis left me with two problemsp  ol liMy library would have to transparentlyefficiently work out whether to call the ANSIWide version of windows functions E.g. CreateFileA or CreateFileW depending on how the template was expanded.li liMy library would sometimes need to use string literals, so I needed a way of translating a string literal into either  or L without creating a runtime cost or confusing the logic.li ol  pIve created what I think is a reasonably elegant solution to these two problems but I wanted the stack overflow community to tell me if there are any hidden costsnasties associated with them.p  pFirstly to solve 1 since my template class has T as the character type, I created the following templatesmacros in a detail namespace within my classp  precode Selector template to choose between W and A versions of win32 functions templatelttypename WF, typename AFgt inline WFamp selectw32funcAF amp,        WF amp pFuncW, wchart  return pFuncW  templatelttypename WF, typename AFgt inline AFamp selectw32funcAF amp pFuncA, WF amp,        char     return pFuncA  templatelttypename Tgt inline T gettraits  return NULL   define SELECTW32FUNCx    auto x  detailselectw32funcxA, xW, detailgettraitsltTgt define SELECTW32FUNCSx,y auto x  detailselectw32funcx, y, detailgettraitsltTgt codepre  pNext to solve 2 I created the following templates and macrop  precodetemplatelttypename WC, typename ACgt inline const WC selectchartraitconst AC,   const WC b, wchart  return b  templatelttypename WC, typename ACgt inline const AC selectchartraitconst AC a, const WC,   char     return a  templatelttypename WC, typename ACgt inline const WC selectchartraitconst AC,     const WC b,  wchart  return b  templatelttypename WC, typename ACgt inline const AC selectchartraitconst AC a,   const WC,    char     return a    Macro which allows string literals to be adapted by template parameter T define Sx detailselectchartraitx, Lx, detailgettraitsltTgt codepre  pThis allows me to write the constructors and member functions of my class almost as if I wasnt dealing with templated parameters, for example, the following constructor, constructs a w32file object with a CSIDL special folder identifier as its parentp  precodebasicw32fileDWORD dwCSIDL, stdbasicstringltTgt amp child  mname MAXPATH,       SELECTW32FUNCPathCombine   SELECTW32FUNCSstrlen, wcslen    basicw32fileltTgt parent getSystemDirectory  dwCSIDL, S    if child  S.  child  S..     PathCombineampmname[0], parent.getAbsoluteName.cstr, child.cstr   else     PathCombineampmname[0], parent.getPath.cstr, child.cstr    mname.resize strlenampmname[0]   codepre  pAs you can see, the SELECTW32FUNC macro overrides the globally namespaced PathCombine definition and replaces it with a function reference to either the A or W version of the function.  S.. puts the correct string literal in place.p  pMy feeling is that this will be very efficient since the template selector functions will be inlined and have essentially no runtime logic in them, meaning that they should be optimized down to almost nothing, is this a correct assumption  p

dark. The package Im usingNASA WorldWind is written in JAVA, using JOGL, so Im using JOGL to use a custom fragment and vertex shader to create this effect. p  pThere are a couple of strange things happening that I believe may be signs of what is is that is causing the lack of shading. p  pFirst, if the fragment shader is changed to just color all pixels red without reason, the working machines will display a red sphere. The machines that dont work, flash the red sphere for one draw, and then the map reverts back to the original imagesthe whole globe can be seen, and the oceans are dark.p  pSecond, if a change is made to the java package such that the rendering loop doesnt call glUseProgram0, the working machines render strangely, but still close, and the machines that are not working will have a translucent sphere that is whatever color I set GLfragcolor to in the shader. This is made even more strange by the fact that it is ignoring the discared pixels and shading them this color anyways.p  pThird, most of the debugging information Ive gotten from turning jogl debugging on is trash, but on the ATI machine I can see it retrieving a poweroftwo texture quite often, while on the nvidia machine that doesnt have an identical pair, the poweroftwo texture comes up once or twice at the beginning of runtime. p  pThe shaders are receiving a uniform sampler2D from the JOGL code, and using it to create a texture2D that the color of the pixel is retrieved through.brbrFragment Shader brp  precodeuniform sampler2D tileimage uniform float brightness const vec3 coef  vec30.2125, 0.7154, 0.0721 uniform float saturation uniform vec4 hueToAdjust  vec4 shadeTilevec4 tileval  Fragment shader.

Negative 1467 pMight be a stupid question but in our iOS app were storing an integer for a UI color preference. In drawRect of a custom view, were currently getting that preference value and using it to set a particular UIColor for some text that is drawn.p  pI understand that standardUserDefaults values are cached, but is this an inefficient way of doing things Should we instead add a local ivar to the custom view and pull the preference value on init and then register for a notification when defaults are changed, so the value can be updated p

Negative 1467 pI am wondering what the best approach is to managing monitoring a connection to a server database using the Entity Framework.p  pI know that the EF DB context or Object context does the main bits for you. However, in our scenario a user may unplug a network cable to the client or stop the server on the server machine, etc.p  pDB Server lt Network lt Fat Client EFp  pTherefore, in the above scenario if the network goes down and the client attempts any operation that requires data access there will be an exception The underlying provider failed on open.p  pWhat is the best approach for detecting a loss of connection to a DB so that the client application where the DB context UoW, Rep etc resides can fail gracefully p  pOne solution that I have seen is to open a manual connection to the server DB DBConnection and then poll the DB using a Timer in C and writing to a heartbeat table. Then catching the exception when it occurs. This seems like a massive hack to me.p  pAny help would be appreciated... Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1467 pReferring to a hrefhttpsgithub.comnewrelicnewrelicapi relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnewrelicnewrelicapia for the New Relic API, I was wondering what was the difference between hosts and instances.p  pBasically, I get what an application is and what a server is obviously. I would assume instances are instances of the application, i.e. if my app were running on Heroku, each instance would correspond to a dyno running my app. But then what is a host And whats the difference between host and instancep  pThanks,p  pBillyp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks for the answerp  pSo if I got this right, in the general case, the mapping between applications and instances is 1ton, i.e. each app can have 1 or more instances. Also, the mapping between instances and hosts is ntom, i.e. each instance can be running on at most one host at any given time, but instances are distributed among available hosts. Similarly, hosts are distributed among servers say, mtos. Is that it Apologies if this sound like Im saying very obvious stuff, but Im unfamiliar with the terminology they are using over at New Relicp  pIf the above is correct, how can I get the instances  hosts and hosts  servers mappings from the API I can see how to get the applications  instances and applications  hosts, but what about the other twop  pThanks again for your helpp

We do something, create a Put object, flush the htable, do something more, create a Put object... and so on.p  pWhat happens if my HTable Object loses the connection to the HBase Is this handled internally Or do I need to close my HTable Object and to open a new HTable object then Until now I thought that connections are handled from the HTable Object internally with a connection pool, so that I done have to do anything. I thought it would be enough to catch an exception and then to retry. As clearBufferOnFail is set to true, no duplicated data would be written.p  pBut can it happen that too many Connections are open somehow Or is this all handledp  pThanks for an answer p

Negative 1467 pI work for a very large organization that is looking for new ideas.  Currently there is this large project in place that is supposed to provide a common architecture for a wide variety of applications.  We are organized as many shared components that get used to create a deployable unit or DU, a DU is the final application.p  pWithout going into too much boring and sensitive detail, the way we are doing it now is not working. We have 30 applications and you can wait more than 2 years before getting permission to do anything more than the most desperate emergency fix.  I am looking for suggestions that cover organization and testing.p  pIf you are interested, my idea so far is as followsp  ol liCreate teams based on specialized skills.  For example a GUI team, a JSP team, a Database team, a HTMLCSS team, etc.  When these guys get requests for solutions they are ideally placed to see reuse opportunities which should speed development.  The fact that the team is composed of subject matter experts also means that the quality of the code produced should be better as well.  These teams will produce custom solutions tailored for the request and will contain only what is needed to provide the solution  nothing else.li liCreate a team that works with the business client who will gather requirements and then go to the appropriate specialized team for solutions.  This team will then be responsible for integrating the various solutions into the final application and performing unit testing.li liAs much as possible make use of automated testing tools e.g. JUnit.  Also, in order to maximize the number of applications that can go through user acceptance testing in production like environments you establish short fixed testing durations.  If you are not ready at the end of that time frame you go back to development and unit testing  strongno exceptionsstrong  In other words be damn sure you are ready for user acceptanceproduction before you request it.li ol  pWhat you end up with is two groups of teams.  One groups is application centric, concerned with providing big picture solutions to business clients.  The other group is tech centric, doesnt really know or care about the big picture just their specialty.p  pIs there anything even remotely like what I have just described already out therep

Negative 1467 pProblem statement I have a page main.jsp with a header, left panel and content divs. When I click on any link in the left panel I use a javascript ajax call to load the content in the  div. So far so good. Now this newly loaded content is actually page one of three of an input form. So this form1 has a submit button that posts data to a servlet which in turn forwards a jsp as a view. This view is nothing but form2 of three.p  pNow I want this form2 to also load in the same div. As of now when i click on next the form2 opens a new page rather than opening in the parent pages  div. p  pI dont want to use frames. How do I achieve this is there a way to call the ajax function in main.jsp from form1,2,3 etc p  pThanksp

Negative 1467 pI have created a custom control which requires visual state management. As there is no support for VisualStateManager in .Net 3.5 framework. So I am using WPFToolkit v3.5.40619.1 internally in order to make use of VisualStateManager in my control project.p  pNow if I use that custom control in a separate project by adding reference to it, I have to add reference to WPFToolkit.dll also because my control uses it internally.

The existing database already has its own user  group  membership tables setup in a rather quirky way might I add, but it works.p  pWith the MVC3 style MembershipProviders I could roll my own extending what I needed to login, check role permissions, modify user attributes etc. but Im at a loss as to how to achieve this with MVC4 and its SimpleMembership and then how to use OpenAuth alongside it as an alternate way to login.p  pIve been looking around but there seems to be very little content online yet regarding it, any ideasp  pI dont require a SimpleMembership implementation, if anyone is aware of another similar provider that would do too.p

Negative 1467 pI am writing a DAWstyle app and need to implement the sidescrolling timeline common in such programs. In other words it should appear to the user as though they are scrolling through a very large bitmap, several of them actually for the different tracks, seamlessly. Obviously I will have memory issues if I do it with a single very large horizontallyscrolling View, but that needs to be the effect the user sees. Right now I have a custom View for each track and drawing the wave into its Canvas.p  pI have thought of constructing three Views, left, active and right, and simply swapping out new data when the left or right one is scrolled to in time to be ready for the next screenfull. I think something along these lines is going to be the final solution, but I am not sure what would be the best way to implement it. Should I run a service in the background that watches for and updates the offscreen views, would that be the best way to accomplish this I havent used services before. Or is there a more direct way of doing it, attaching some code to the view to execute automaticallyp  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 1467 pI have a ListView that uses an adapter to populate a list of ImageViews.  Im following the standard practice of p  pa inflating a new view only if convertView is null, andp  pb using a viewHolder to avoid calling findViewById if convertView is not nullp  pIm also using an AsyncTask to populate the ImageViews from a database or from disk cache or LRU memory cache, if possible.p  pEverything works fine for awhile i.e., images populate in the list with smooth scrolling, but I have a leak that gives an OOM error after about 70 x 1.4M images have been loaded. p  pMy understanding is that ListViews are recycled when getView returns a nonnull convertView, so I shouldnt see a memory build up like this.  In my case, the apps memory use grows every time an ImageView gets assigned a Bitmap.  And in fact, the Activity holds onto this memory even after Ive cleared the underlying list via list.clear, and zeroed out the adapter via adapter.notifyDataSetInvalidated  both in the onStop function.p  pThe MAT tool shows stranded Bitmaps and stranded ImageViews approximately 1to1 with the images loaded, but I dont know whats holding a reference that would prevent garbage collection of the old views.p  pId appreciate any suggestions for how to track down this leak.

This is set from the beginning of the program. The program is running on the main thread. My question, though, is why does the output appear this wayp  pThe way this is laid out would seem to imply that the Exception was thrown when the program reached 0,3, but the exception must have been thrown when it reached 1,1. Then, the output would imply that, once the exception was found, the program continued to execute until the loop exited.p  pI dont understand this behavior. When an unhandled exception is encountered, why doesnt the program simply exit Additionally, why does the Exception message appear before the line invoking the Exception Note that the codeSystem.out.printlncode comes before the codetrycode block.p  pLastly, why does the error split in such an odd way In that the error message appears, then the details appear after the program appears to continue execution.

Negative 1467 pWe are trying to run JSFUnit with Arquillian on a WebLogic 12c container and are running into a few problems.p  pFirst, when we try to use the InitialPage annotation to inject in the JSFServerSession and JSFClientSession, the JSFServerSession is always returned as null.p  pSecond, we have tried working around the problem by going the legacy route of creating a new JSFSession and then getting the JSFServerSession and JSFClientSession from it.  Once we run a second test we get java.lang.IllegalStateException Can not find HttpSession.  Make sure JSFUnitFilter has run and your test extends org.apache.cactus.ServletTestCase.p  pIt seems very arbitrary because there are times where we will run a test and it passes.  Sometimes the very next time it fails.  Or adding a line that doesnt seem like it should be related, will thrown the Can not find HttpSession error.p  pIt seems like it cant handle creating the JSFSession multiple times or there is some timeout on the server that even though the test war is getting undeployed something needs to timeout.

Negative 1467 pIm making a simple VB.net application, which basically asks the user for multiple files and stronglaterstrong it will need to access the selected files and modify them.p  pRight now, Im saving the full paths of the selected files, and in the future, the application will iterate through each path, open the file from such path, and modify it.p  pThe problem with that is that the user could select a file so the full path is saved and then they delete or move the file before my application modifies it.p  pNormally, Id throw an error saying File not found, but Im under the impression that Windows had a feature that would disallow you from deletingmovingrenaming a file because a program was using it  which is a feature that would fit way better for my application.p  pIm not very advanced with VB.NET, but I suppose that if I open a file using my application with some IO thing, the feature I mentioned earlier would indeed trigger and the user would be unable to modify the file because it is opened by my application. p  pHowever, since my only desire is to reserve files, it seems to be quite wasteful to actually open them when I dont really need to yet. Is there a way to tell Windows I need a certain file to be intactp
Negative 1467 pFolks,p  pI am a little new to stashing in git so may be I missing something basic here, this is what I am doingp  ul liI am on my master branch and I have been working on a file appmodelsmedicine.rb , I want to pull changes  from master pushed by my coworker. So I do a stronggit stashstrongli liNow I do a stronggit pull origin masterstrong this pulls all the new changesli liNow I do a stronggit stash popstrong, it complains that there are merge conflicts I fix themli liNow when I do a stronggit diff appmodelsmedicine.rbstrong I do not see any of the changes that I had stashed in diff. Also when I do a stronggit logstrong I do not see my work committed anywhere.li ul  pSo looks like those changes that I was working on got committed, I was not expecting that to happen. I wanted to work further and then do a commit. So is my understanding of stash wrong What if I have a use case, where I am working on something and then I am not ready to commit yet but want to pull and then continue  to work further and then do a commit, what is the right git process for this  Also the other side effect is there is no sha for my stashed work now, lets say I want to go back at some point to my work or cherry pick my work there is no way to do that. I dont even see it in my git log. Thanks a lot for any feedback.p

Negative 1467 pIm developing an MVC spring web app, and I would like to store the actions of my users what they click on, etc. in a database for offline analysis. Lets say an action is a tuple long userId, long actionId, Date timestamp. Im not specifically interested in the actions of my users, but I take this as an example.p  pI expect a lot of actions by a lot of different users par minutes seconds. Hence the processing time is crucial.p  pIn my current implementation, Ive defined a datasource with a connection pool to store the actions in a database. I call a service from the request method of a controller, and this service calls a DAO which saves the action into the database.p  pThis implementation is not efficient because it waits that the call from the controller and all the way down to the database is done to return the response to the user. Therefore I was thinking of wrapping this action saving into a thread, so that the response to the user is faster. The thread does not need to be finished to get the reponse.p  pIve no experience in these massive, concurrent and timecritical applications. So any feedbackcomments would be very helpful.p  pNow my questions arep  ul lipHow would you design such system would you implement a service and then wrap it into a thread called at every actionpli lipWhat should I use I checked spring Batch, and this JobLauncher, but Im not sure if it is the right thing for me.pli lipWhat happen when there are concurrent accesses at the controller, the service, the DAO and the datasource levelpli ul  pIn more general terms, what are the best practices for designing such applicationsp  pThank you for your helpp

Negative 1467 pstrongSummarystrong I do have a trivial application demoprototype with the activity that displays a list of items here customers. The items are retreived from the application SQLite database. I am using the codeContentProvidercode approach with codeLoaderManagercode and codeSimpleCursorAdaptercode. I need to convert menuitem selection by a user to the selected way of sorting the list. What is the usual way do that How that user selection should be saved for future I am a beginner concerning the Android programming.p  pstrongDetailsstrong In my activity codeonCreatecode method, the codefillDatacode method see the code below, learned from the tutorial is called to populate the list. It calls the codegetLoaderManager.initLoader0, null, thiscode, and that in turn causes calling the codeonCreateLoadercode that returns the codeCursorLoadercode instance. The cursor loader uses the content provider and passes also the argument that defines sorting. So far, I am using a fixed argument for sorting the list. My guess is that I should call the codefillDatacode when processing the menu item click. It should cause creating another loader and another adapter. But how the information should be passed to the codeonCreateLoadercodep  precodeOverride public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item      switch item.getItemId      case R.id.insertcustomer    this already works for me         createCustomer         return true      case R.id.customersorderbynameasc                                What should be here         fillData               I should probably call this.         return true      case R.id.customersorderbynamedesc                  fillData         return true          return super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem  ... private void fillData      String[] from  new String[]  CustomerTable.COLUMNCODE,                                    CustomerTable.COLUMNNAME,                                    CustomerTable.COLUMNTOWN,                                    CustomerTable.COLUMNSTREET     int[] to  new int[]  R.id.code, R.id.name, R.id.town, R.id.street       getLoaderManager.initLoader0, null, this     adapter  new SimpleCursorAdapterthis,             R.layout.customerrow, null, from, to, 0     setListAdapteradapter    After initLoader...

Negative 1467 pIve been puzzling over this for a few days now.  Basically, I have a view model that contains three IEnumerables of other view models to be displayed in three separate Kendo controls  one as a ListView, and two as GridViews.  Each view model has a separate editor template that is used by the corresponding control.  The GridViews are working 100, and the Kendo ListView is working properly on the page the ListView refreshes with the updated data.p  pstrongMy problem is that an IEnumerable of the view model is being passed to the ActionResult with a null value instead of just a single instance of the view model, and the DataSourceRequest is empty.strongp  pHere is the redacted code.p  pThe view models just the wrapper and view model for the ListView in questionp  precodepublic class MainPersonViewModel      public MainPersonViewModel      public int PersonId  get set      public IEnumerableltDetailsViewModelgt PersonDetails  get set      public IEnumerableltAddressViewModelgt Addresses  get set      public IEnumerableltPersonGroupingViewModelgt MemberOf  get set    public class DetailsViewModel      public DetailsViewModel      public int PersonId  get set      public string Name  get set      public string WorkingTitle  get set   codepre  pThe Kendo ListView templatep  precodemodel Staff.ViewModels.MainPersonViewModel  ltscript typetextxkendotmpl idpersonDetailsTemplategt lttablegt lttrgt     lttdgtName lttdgtlttdgtNamelttdgt lttrgt lttrgt     lttdgtWorking Title lttdgtlttdgtTitlelttdgt lttrgt lttrgt     lttd colspan2gt     ltdiv classeditbuttonsgt     lta classkbutton kbuttonicontext keditbutton hrefgtltspan   classkicon keditgtltspangtEditltagt     ltdivgt     lttdgt lttrgt lttablegt ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd the Kendo control itselfp  precodeHtml.Kendo.ListViewltStaff.ViewModels.DetailsViewModelgtModel.PersonDetails .NamepersonDetailsList .TagNamediv .ClientTemplateIdpersonDetailsTemplate .Editable .DataSourceds gt ds     .Modelm gt                      m.Idf gt f.PersonId             m.Fieldf gt f.Name             m.Fieldf gt f.WorkingTitle                   .Readread gt read.ActionViewPersonDetails, Staff, new id  Model.PersonId     .Updateupdate gt update.ActionUpdatePersonDetails, Staff  codepre  p                p  pThe ActionResult called by the Listview in the controller is as followsp  precodepublic class StaffController  Controller      [AcceptVerbsHttpVerbs.Post]     public ActionResult UpdatePersonDetails[DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request, IEnumerableltDetailsViewModelgt toUpdate              update code here         return JsonModelState.ToDataSourceResult       codepre  pFinally the editor template located in ViewsStaffEditorTemplatesp  precodemodel Staff.ViewModels.DetailsViewModel ltdivgt     lttablegt         lttrgt             lttdgtHtml.LabelForm gt m.NameFirstlttdgt             lttdgtHtml.EditorForm gt m.NameFirstlttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgtHtml.LabelForm gt m.NameLastlttdgt             lttdgtHtml.EditorForm gt m.NameLastlttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgtHtml.LabelForm gt m.Titlelttdgt             lttdgtHtml.EditorForm gt m.Titlelttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttd colspan2gt                 ltdiv classeditbuttonsgt                     lta classkbutton kbuttonicontext kupdatebutton hrefgtltspan classkicon kupdategtltspangtSaveltagt                     lta classkbutton kbuttonicontext kcancelbutton hrefgtltspan classkicon kcancelgtltspangtCancelltagt                 ltdivgt             lttdgt         lttrgt     lttablegt ltdivgt codepre  pSince the ListView seems to be refreshing I dont think its necessarily a problem with it or the DataSource on the page, so Im leaning towards some detail i.e. limitation with the editor template that Im missing.

Negative 1467 pI just realized there is something mysterious at least for me in the way you can add vertex instructions in Kivy with the codewithcode Python statement. For example, the way codewithcode is used goes something like thisp  precode... some code class MyWidgetWidget     ... some code       def somemethod self         with self.canvas            Rectangleposself.pos, sizeself.size codepre  pAt the beginning I thought that it was just the codewithcode Python statement that I have used occasionally. But suddenly I realize it is not. Usually it looks more  like this example taken from a hrefhttppreshing.com20110920thepythonwithstatementbyexample relnofollowhereap  precodewith openoutput.txt, w as f    f.writeHi there codepre  pThere is usually an codeascode after the instance and something like and alias to the object. In the Kivy example we dont define and alias which is still ok. But the part that puzzles me is that instruction Rectangle is still associated to the self.canvas. After reading about the codewithcode statement, I am quite convinced that the Kivy code should be written likep  precodeclass MyWidgetWidget     ... some code       def somemethod self         with self.canvas as c            c.add Rectangleposself.pos, sizeself.size codepre  pI am assuming that internally the method codeaddcode is the one being called. The assumption is based that we can simply add the rectangles with codeself.add Rectangleposself.pos, sizeself.sizecodep  pAm I missing something about the codewithcode Python statement or is this somehow something Kivy implementsp

Negative 1467 pIs there a simple way to use Durandals transitions to fade out an old view immediately, and fade in the new one once its activate function has resolvedp  pHeres some contextp  pI have a Durandal 1.2 SPA where most of the views activate functions make service calls and return a promise as appropriate. This all works great, but transitions only run when loading is complete sometimes services can take few seconds to respond  leading to a poor user experience where you click on a link and it takes a few seconds before anything noticeable happens.p  pThe solution is to animate away the old view immediately before activate resolves and then animate in the new view when activate is done. At the moment, every animated view corresponds to a route and I dont expect this to change. Ive come up with and tested a few solutions that all work but seem less than ideal and dont leverage Durandals transition frameworkp  ul liManually animate away every view in its deactivate and animate it back in via its viewAttachedli liBind the .pagehost divs visibility to router.isNavigating using a custom binding to handle the transition such as the fadeVisible example from the knockout siteli liManually subscribe to router.isNavigating and run custom logic when it changesli ul  pIve tried them all and so far I like the custom binding on the .pagehost div the best since it involves the least amount of code, but it only works in my case because of my specific circumstances and isnt a generic solution.p  pThis seems like exactly the sort of thing Durandals transitions were created for. Is there a more elegant way to do this in Durandal using transitions in 1.2 or the upcoming 2.0 releasep  pI saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16738107durandaljswhyaretransitionsnotstartingrightawaywhenausernavigatesthis questiona which seems to be asking something similar, but seems a little less specific and doesnt have a relevant answer.p

Negative 1467 pI have a database table with about 40,000 records containing code fields, such as FLEFSU25B25M EMG10905Sp  pI need to be able to very quickly select all codes that contain a given substring. For example 109 matches EMG10905S.p  pMy current approach is to store the codes in Lucene and have Lucene filter by substring  such as em109em But that is not very efficient if I just store the codes, because than Lucene has to search through all the tokens.p  pTo overcome this, Im thinking of creating a new analyzer that will split each code into tokens, like this     EMG10905Sbr      MG10905Sbr       G10905Sbr        10905Sbr     ...p  pThen to find all codes with substring 109, I can search on 109 which is much more efficient I understand Lucene stores tokens alphabetically, just like SQL Server indexes.p  pDoes this make sense Does such an analyzer already exist Im using .NetC.p
Negative 1467 pI am having trouble writing an object constructor in Javascript. When I call a function on one of my instantiated objects, it always returns the value of the instantiated object. The flow is like this p  precodeblue  toolblue blue.jDom      returns [ltdiv idblue classtoolgt...ltdivgt] red  toolred red.jDom      returns [ltdiv idred classtoolgt...ltdivgt] blue.jDom      returns [ltdiv idred classtoolgt...ltdivgt] codepre  pI believe this is due to the private variables I included in the prototype declaration. If I move the prototype declaration into the constructor, everything works fine, but this is simply masking the fact that it seems like my objects are affecting the properties of the prototype, rather than themselves, by creating a new prototype for each object.

Negative 1467 pshown here is a method that is for inserting values into columns of an SQLite database. I have never worked with a database with this many columns before. and there are over 15 tables in this database.  I did not design the database, someone else did. p  phow do I refactor this android method if possible to make it better or less verbose, it looks like i cant use a collections object like ArrayList because all of the arguments are not one type, there are multiple types like String, Float, and int.p  pso this would require making a custom java function, however that does not look like it is worth the effort.  and there are 15 different tables that would require 15 custom objects.p  psome of what is general knowledge would suggest that too many arguments in a method is more than 4 or 5.

Session is created and added to memcached.li liClient connects to a secure socket.io server using SSL.li liClient sends raw cookie data to socket.io server.li liServer does some string splitting with the cookie data and gets the session id.li liServer checks the cache to see if session id exists. If yes, user is logged inli liUser logs out on CodeIgniter site. Session data is destroyed.li ol  pHowever, there are a few problems that I can think of with this approachp  pstrike1.

Negative 1467 pI have a jenkins agent set up on window 7 and a jenkins server on Linux. I am running GUI testing on the windows agent. It runs fine if I have a remote desktop connection connected to it, but fails otherwise. I found this link, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10177708jenkinsonwindowsandguitestswithoutrdcJenkins on Windows and GUI Tests without RDCap  pBut the solution provided there is pretty vague.. It seems like the only solution is to somehow make Jenkins server to have a remote desktop connection open at all times. But I cant find such an option to do so.  Could anyone please clearly teach me how to solve this issue p  pMuch appreciatedp

Negative 1467 pI am faced with an issue that I cannot seem to resolve. Consuming a java based web service using wcf and ws security. Using nonmtom requests, the public key certificate gets sent as part of the binarysecurityelement as a base64 string. However the same certificate is mtomencoded for mtom requests. Is there a way I can avoid that using wcf so that the public key certificate gets sent as an embedded base 64 string within the binarysecurityelement and not as a multipart section beneath the soap request envelopep  pThis is happening for a certificate with public key is an RSA 2048 bits and works fine for a certificate with public key  RSA 1024 bitsp  pSo with the certificate having RSA 2048 bit public key something like below is happeningp  precodeltoBinarySecurityToken uIduuid4d4ee76557174d539ac999bddc07df6c2 ValueTypehttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wssx509tokenprofile1.0X509v3 EncodingTypehttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wsssoapmessagesecurity1.0Base64Binarygt         ltxopInclude hrefcidhttp3A2F2Ftempuri.org2F12F632618206525089430 xmlnsxophttpwww.w3.org200408xopincludegt       ltoBinarySecurityTokengt codepre  pInstead I need the base64 certificate value embedded instead of the xopinclude element.

Thoughtsp  pNot sure if custom encoder will help here too, invoked writemessage on the message object using an xmlwriter to a file.

Negative 1467 pI am building a site that displays forms for different vendors. p  pEach vendor have some common properties, but there are some properties specific to some vendors. For instance one vendor asks for codecustomers Titlecode ie codeMrcode, codeMrscode... while others dont. Even more, some of the properties may have different behavior. In the codeTitlecode example above, one vendor could have it as a free text, while another would have it as an option select.p  pFor this, i have a base class as a model, that holds the most common properties, and for each vendor i will create classes inheriting from the base to add the vendor specific properties, or change their behavior like adding Data Annotations.p  pSo, i would like to create forms specific to each vendor. What i have done and it really works, is create the generic one in the standard codeViewscode, codeModelscode, codeControllerscode folders and each Vendor will have his own codeAreacode.p  pIs this really the right approach I have seen that areas are mostly for mini sites or for localization. p  pAny opinion would be appreciated. p

Negative 1467 pI am fairly new to Python and Robot, so please bare with me, but here is what I am trying to do. p  pI am doing some automation on 2 mobile devices, and I have a library created that allows me to communicate with these devices, provided to me by one of our dev teams. In my test suite I have to import this library twice, one instance for each device, and I am using the robot WITH NAME to call keywords specific to each device. For example I import the library like thisp  precodeLibrary    keywordmodule.DEVICE.DEVICE    USBGUID1    WITH NAME    d1 Library    keywordmodule.DEVICE.DEVICE    USBGUID2    WITH NAME    d2 codepre  pThe library has a set of keywords that I can call from Robot to perform basic operations on the device. Such asp  precoded1.turnonwifi d2.turnoncellular codepre  pI then created my own python module, in this module I created keywords that take some keywords from this library to create higher level functions. I used Robots BuiltIn.getlibraryinstance to bring in the instances above so i can work with the keywords in my module. For examplep  precodeclass Commonobject      def initself, libName         self.d  BuiltIn.getlibraryinstancelibName      def somekeywordself         self.d.turnonwifi         self.d.turnoffcellular codepre  pI then import my module for both devices as followsp  precodeLibrary    keywordmodule.DEVICE.DEVICE    [USBGUID1    WITH NAME    d1 Library    keywordmodule.DEVICE.DEVICE    [USBGUID2    WITH NAME    d2 Library    Common.Common    d1    WITH NAME    D1 Library    Common.Common    d2    WITH NAME    D2 codepre  pSo now I can call my keywords from Common with D1 and D2, and use d1 and d2 for the DEVICE library. p  pThe problem is that my library is growing larger and larger, and I want to break it down into sub modules that are grouped based on similar traits, ie I want one filemodule for my wifi keywords that I create, another for cellular, another for something else.p  pI could just do what I did above for each file, however then I would end up with a large list of imports in Robot all with different names, which is what I wanted to avoid. p  pIs there a way for me to move my keywords into multiple files but still only have one import for each device in Robot. I basically want to have multiple py files, but have them all linked somehow so that I can still only import the one Common library for each device and this will expose all of the keywords for me to call from all the subfilesp  pDoes that make sensep

Negative 1467 pI have a git repository that I used to maintain all the .tex files, figures, and code corresponding to a research article. Actually, I have several articles, one repository per article. Now I am working on my dissertation which has its own git repository, and several of the chapters will be based on previous research, i.e. the content in the article repositories. p  pHow can I copy the relevant files from the article git repository to the dissertation repository so that I can sync selected commits between the two repositoriesp  pFor example, I make a commit to the dissertation that changes several lines of a .tex file to make the output match the required formatting for my dissertation. These changes should never be reflected in the article repository. However, I make a second commit that fixes a typo in a different section of the .tex file. The changes from the second commit, emand only these changesem should be synced to the article repository. One of my coauthors from the article expands one of the sections in the .tex file in the article repository. I want to pull these changes, but only the changes from that commit, not overwriting other sections over to the dissertation repository.p  pWhat is the simplest way to update one repository with select changes from another repository, given that some sections of the files between the two repositories may start to diverge considerablyp

Usually a widget have a little nice box with a title and the content, with a little logic, how I can include a partial like that to another view like that.p  precodeextendsjarvis.admin.layouts.default  sectiontitle   Dashboard stop  sectionmain ltdiv classrowfluidgt     ltdiv classspan4gt         yieldfirst          ltdiv classjarviswidget idwidgetid00gt             ltheadergt                 lth2gt widget[title] lth2gt                                        ltheadergt             ltdivgt                 ltdiv classjarviswidgeteditboxgt                     ltdivgt                         ltlabelgt ucfirstLanggetstrings.title ltlabelgt                         ltinput typetextgt                     ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                         ltlabelgt ucfirstLanggetstrings.style ltlabelgt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylered classredbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylegreen classgreenbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylepurple classpurplebtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstyleblack classblackbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstyledarkgrey classdarkgreybtngtltspangt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv classjarviswidgettimestampgtltdivgt                 ltdiv classinnerspacergt                      lt content goes here gt                     yieldwgcontent                      Content                  ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt      ltdivgt     ltdiv classspan4gt         yieldsecond          ltdiv classjarviswidget idwidgetid00gt             ltheadergt                 lth2gt widget[title] lth2gt                                        ltheadergt             ltdivgt                 ltdiv classjarviswidgeteditboxgt                     ltdivgt                         ltlabelgt ucfirstLanggetstrings.title ltlabelgt                         ltinput typetextgt                     ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                         ltlabelgt ucfirstLanggetstrings.style ltlabelgt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylered classredbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylegreen classgreenbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylepurple classpurplebtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstyleblack classblackbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstyledarkgrey classdarkgreybtngtltspangt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv classjarviswidgettimestampgtltdivgt                 ltdiv classinnerspacergt                      lt content goes here gt                     yieldwgcontent                      Content                  ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt      ltdivgt     ltdiv classspan4gt         yieldthird          ltdiv classjarviswidget idwidgetid00gt             ltheadergt                 lth2gt widget[title] lth2gt                                        ltheadergt             ltdivgt                 ltdiv classjarviswidgeteditboxgt                     ltdivgt                         ltlabelgt ucfirstLanggetstrings.title ltlabelgt                         ltinput typetextgt                     ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                         ltlabelgt ucfirstLanggetstrings.style ltlabelgt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylered classredbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylegreen classgreenbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstylepurple classpurplebtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstyleblack classblackbtngtltspangt                         ltspan datawidgetsetstyledarkgrey classdarkgreybtngtltspangt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv classjarviswidgettimestampgtltdivgt                 ltdiv classinnerspacergt                      lt content goes here gt                     yieldwgcontent                      Content                  ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt      ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classrowfluidgt     ltdiv classspan12gt     ltdivgt ltdivgt stop codepre  pWhere each yield will load a small widget processing the little logic or even another template with another nested views.p  pFor example yieldfirst will load a box that is another template with a yield inside, and a variable as title. This nested yield will have another yield or the content... then the same box we use for the box will be used another time to render yieldsecond with another title and another content, that maybe use the same as the first yield.p  pI dont understand how to make this cascade with blade template system. Is there a way to do something similarp  pI know is complicated but if you ever used .net, you could understand what I mean.p  pThanks and sorry for my english.p  pDo that have similarities with the HMVC model, but is not the same.p

I have the sidebars contents in 5 static cells and the search bar makes a search to a remote database to retrieve the results. p  pMy issue is that if my search results contain more than 5 elements, I get the following errorp  precode Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSRangeException, reason  [NSArrayI objectAtIndex] index 5 beyond bounds [0 .. 4] codepre  pIm not exactly sure whats happening behind the scenes, but Im fairly certain that despite having the following code, the number of rows set for the table view section in Storyboard 5 is overriding everything.p  precode NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection      if tableView  self.searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableView          return [[self filteredCappegoryArray] count]      else          return [super tableViewtableView numberOfRowsInSection0]       codepre  pI would switch the sidebar to use dynamic cells, but one of my cells contains a container view, and XCode doesnt allow me to have a container view in a prototype cell.

Negative 1467 pQuick question, I am reading the textbook entitled Introduction to 80x86 Assembly Language and Computer Architecture by Richard C. Detmer and on page 21 and 22 it talks about the concept of what a borrow is, but it doesnt really describe what it really is. Here is the textp  blockquote   pIn a computer, subtraction a  b of numbers a and b is usually performed by taking the 2s complement of b and adding the result to a. This corresponds to adding the negation of b. For example, for the decimal subtraction 195  618  423,p      p00C3  026Ap      pis changed to addition of FD96, the 2s complement of 026A.p      p00C3  FD96  FE59p      pThe hex digits FE59 represent 423. Looking at the previous addition in binary, you havep      p0000 0000 1100 0011  1111 1101 1001 0110  1111 1110 0101 1001p      pNotice that there was no carry in the addition. However, this subtraction did involve a strongborrowstrong. A strongborrowstrong occurs in the subtraction a  b when b is larger than a as unsigned numbers. Computer hardware can detect a borrow in subtraction by looking at whether a carry occurred in the corresponding addition. If there is no carry in the addition, then there is a strongborrowstrong in the subtraction. If there is a carry in the addition, then there is no strongborrowstrong in the subtraction. Remember that carry by itself means carry out.p      pHere is one more example. Doing the decimal subtraction 985  411  574 using wordlength 2s complement representations,p      p03D9  019Bp      pis changed to addition of FE65, the 2s complement of 019B.p      p03D9  FE65  1023E p      p0000 0011 1101 1001  1111 1110 0110 0101  1 0000 0010 0011 1110p      pDiscarding the extra 1, the hex digits 023E represent 574. This addition has a carry, so there is no borrow in the corresponding subtract.p blockquote  pWhat really is a borrow with subtraction I thought when for example 00C3  026A, the A is bigger than the 3, so we must borrow from the corresponding C by making it a B and making it now 13 base 16 minus A. That we can do, but a borrow occured. In this particular example a borrow in the contexts of the book did occur. But when we look at the next example they gave us 03D9  019B, the B is bigger than the 9 so we must borrow from the D by making it a C and making the 9 a 19 base 16 minus B. That we can do, and a borrow occured but the book stated that a borrow did not happen.p  pWhat is a borrow I know you know if one occurred by whether a carry happened in the addition but doing raw subtraction, what is really a borrow. When can I identify if one occurredp  pFor example you know a carry occurred because there is an extra hex digit. The length went out of the length of your two hex numbers length desired to stay within. p  pThank you.p  pDanp

Negative 1467 pIm debugging on an old C application.  There is a screen where I can click to run a query against a server and get a list of results.p  pThe problem is that Im having trouble figuring out how the results are computed.  Each result has a floatingpoint number associated with it that is displayed on the screen.  Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that the number next to the first result is 123.45.p  pI would guess that the number 123.45 must be assigned to a floatingpoint variable at some point, but if there are millions of lines of code, I have a lot of digging to dop  pTherefore, I was wondering that if Im certain that the number 123.45 is assigned to a variable at some point, is there some convenient way to find where it happens and what variable it is assigned to  Is there a debugging tool that does thisp  pbEditb The commenters here are correct to point out that I dont know for sure that the number is assigned to a variable Im just guessing that it likely is.  Also, Im familiar with setting conditions on breakpoints, but that wont help here because to set a breakpoint, you have to know what line the assignment occurs on.p  pMy question here is whether or not there is a way to detect a particular value being assigned in an emunknownem place in the code to an emunknownem variable.  I want to find emwhereem the assignment occurs, and emwhichem variable it is assigned to.p  pbSecond Editb Lets compare this to using the SQL profiler.  If I know that the value 123.45 is being inserted into a table or passed as a parameter to a stored procedure, I can use the SQL profiler and filter the command text for commands that contain the string 123.45.  That would likely find the exact command used to send 123.45 to the SQL server.  Is there something similar I can do if Im looking for the value to be assigned to a C variable, but I dont know which onep  pI think that the answer is probably no, but I thought someone here might be able to shed some light on this.p

Negative 1467 pIm a beginner in all the three Python, Sage and Emacs.

Negative 1467 pim writing an alarm clock app, with a special twist to it. not going to get into detail. anyways, im trying to think of the best way to save the alarms. i figured, since its a pretty basic app, it wouldnt require core data. so i was going to save them under NSUserDefaults. i used NSCoding to encode the objects, but i cant for the life of me figure out which key to use when saving them. Originally, i was going to use a key for each one. but that would involve searching NSUserDefaults keys for any that start with x memory heavy. also id have to find am efficient method to increment the key and circle back around when a key is deleted. so then i tried adding the alarms to a dictionary i tried an array, too and adding THAT object to NSUserDefaults. to no avail. can somebody help me figure out the best way to do this if it has to be core data, so be it. i just figured it was overkill for something as simple as adding alarm instances. shooting for user defaults.p

In other words, Im getting the data just like what codesysblocksdastatcode shows, but in kernel module.p  pNOTE By not partition, I mean we just handle codesdacode and ignore codesda1sda2etccode, for example.p  pIs there anything like codeforeachnetdevcode or codeforeachpossiblecpucode for block device Beacuse there may be multiple disks and I need a way to traverse them. Or at the latest, how can I get the related data structure with the block devices namelike codesdacodep  pI know we can get a disks codediskstatscode from the disks codehdstructcode, but how could I get this codehdstructcodep  pPlease help me. thanks.p

Negative 1467 pLet me explain my setup. I have multiple domain names that are all CNAME records for a main domain name, such as example.com.p  pexample.com  serverIPp  pcompany1.example.com  example.comp  pcompany2.example.com  example.comp  pIm basically developing white labeled versions of our software, where the software simply detects the referrer and knows which logos and stylesheet assets to load.p  pSo that is all well and good, however when socket.io tries to handshake to its url that looks something like a hrefhttpcompany1.example.comsocket.io1key123456 relnofollowhttpcompany1.example.comsocket.io1key123456a, the request hangs in a pending state upon signing into the app. On the main domain, example.com, everything goes through just fine. The dfference is that the main domain sends in a cookie to the socket.io handshake URL whereas the company subdomains do not.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how to fix this It doesnt appear to even be reaching the server and after a few minutes the pending request returns that it could not be completed.p

Negative 1467 pI have a ruby script that, at one point, has an inmemory file that may or may not be backed by an entry in the filesystem. The naive solution would be to create a tempfile if a filesystem entry does not exist, but this will result in the command line command rereading the file into memory.p  pIdeally, I would like to avoid reading the file into memory more than once since it could potentially be quite large.p  pNow, the command line command does accept a piped input, so I thought this might be a good solution, but I cannot find any way to achieve piping a Ruby File objects contents into something happening on the command line.p  pIm also open to other recommendations if Im coming at this from the wrong direction. The files not backed by a filesystem entry are being read from a remote HTTP stream.p

Negative 1467 pI currently have a scenario where i need to extract content from a number of web pages, process the content, the insert into MongoDB. I was pondering what would be the best way to do. Its gotten me a bit confused as there a bunch of way to approach this.p  pI could for instance do something like thisp  precodejobs  groupvisit.si for i  in payload  res   jobsprocess.ssave.s codepre  pAs far as I understand this would visit a page, then process it, then save it. All done asyncmaybe at the same time. This way its full async and there is really no waiting going on, but each item is individual inserted into MongoDB.p  pOn the other hand I could use a callbackp  precodejobs  groupvisit.si for i  in payload  res  chord jobsprocess.s,save.s codepre  pThis would do the aync fetching and processing, but then wait for all the tasks to be completed and then async save the results, which will lead to a bulk insert into MongoDB.p  pSo I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and which is a better approach in general. Should I just go full on async Or have some sync code in there.p  pAlso side question any comments on maybe using chunking instead of single page tasks would be great.p  pThanksp

Negative 1467 pI am having trouble differentiating between the apache HTTP client and HTTPURLConnection.

Negative 1467 pI have a Threading.Tasks.Task that handles a number of client socket operations connecting, receiving and sending.  p  pI understand that where possible its best to use non blocking methods using Await because otherwise Ill end up with parked threads waiting for their response.  However, while the Socket class has async methods SendAsync and so on they arent the same as the usual Task Parallel Library async methods, they dont return a Task and cannot be awaited.p  pI realise that I can wrap these socket async methods with a TaskCompletionSource but is there any benefit to doing so or will it ultimately still be parking the threadp

Eventually, the answer will reach 1  Im trying to grab the number of iterations that the sequence is performed, say if the sequence is run through 10 times, it prints that out.

Negative 1467 pIm currently trying to get two codeboostthreadcodes to get equal processing time on the CPU using a shared mutex called codemutexCOMcode. As it currently stands both threads are set to run infinitely. One thread The main thread simply prints out testing while the other thread, running the codeNavigationbegincode function, prints shared function, waits one second, then prints Shared function will now end.... The wait is meant to simulate the larger amount of processing necessary for the function that will replace this stub. Each iteration of the infinite loops is preceded within the loop by a scoped lock on codemutexCOMcode. The expected output should be something like the following ad infinitump  precodetesting shared function Shared function will now end... testing shared function Shared function will now end... codepre  pUnfortunately, something Ive done causes the output instead to bep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9DzSd.png altThread staggeringp  pp  pIt seems that the iterations are being grouped together instead of being interlaced like I would expect. If anyone can explain whats going on here I would be very appreciative, as it seems that my understanding of thread management using mutexes could use some work.p  pMy only theory is that my assumption that boost handles queuing for locking the mutex is wrong and that I need to somehow create my own queue to give the threads fair access to avoid starvation. However, Im doubtful about this because it would basically render the point of mutexes moot as I would still need to handle all of the management on my own. At that point why not just use a semaphorep  pMy code is as follows. Only relevant code is included, so dont worry about the missing class structure. Assume all headers are properly included and that SharedMutex.h is included in both classesp  pSharedMutex.h p  precodeifndef SHAREDMUTEX define SHAREDMUTEX include ltboostthreadmutex.hppgt extern boostmutex mutexCOM endif codepre  pNavigation.cpp  p  precodeNavigationbegin      boostmutexscopedlock lockmutexCOM     coutltlt shared function ltlt endl     sleep1     coutltlt Shared function will now end... ltlt endl  codepre  pmainclass.cpp  p  precodevoid mainclassrun      thisgtrunNav     while1          boostmutexscopedlock lockmutexCOM         cout ltlt testing ltlt endl       void mainclassrunNav  thisgtnav is an instance of Navigation within mainclass boostthread navThreadboostbindampNavigationbegin, thisgtnav thisgtnavPtr is a pointer to the boostthread for later management thisgtnavPtrampnavThread  codepre

This allows the     compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack     when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this     option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory.     The level parameter can be used to choose the level of precision of     token location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if     necessary. Value 0 of level deactivates this option just as if no     ftrackmacroexpansion was present on the command line. Value 1 tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal     memory overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the expansion     of an argument of a functionlike macro have the same location. Value     2 tracks tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory     hungry. When this option is given no argument, the default parameter     value is 2. Note that ftrackmacroexpansion2 is activated by     default.p   blockquote blockquote

Negative 1467 pIm fairly new to Matlab so any help would be appreciated.p  pIm trying to write a function using simple logic operators to create a number of 2D scatter graphs, the problem Ive been having is that I cannot work out how to use a input from the user the number of figures to actually create that number of figures. p  pedit Just for the sake of clarity Im plotting multiple sets of data ie columns on each figure but the important bit is that there will be multiple figures as the user specifies how many figures they want, this is the bit I cannot understand. I understand how to use hold on to plot more than one graph on each figure but how do I vary the number of figures depending on the input of the userp  pThe user inputs are a matrix with dimensions 4000x30 this will remain constant for my use and the number of figures this will change from 130 to plot from this data set. Each column represents a different sensor so the columns represent 1 set of data each.p  pThe simpler the answer the better as Im not a very experienced coder.p  pThanks GibGibp

Negative 1467 pI am building a web page for a project in .net that displays a basketball tournament bracket. Each team has a button next to their name that when clicked advances them in the bracket and the team they played moves to a loser bracket its for double elimination. You can drag the bracket and zoom so I decided to use ajax calls to update winners and losers and then display the results without posting back, refreshing page, and losing zoom  drag positions.p  pWhile selecting winners for a 64 team bracket, the ajax calls work pretty quickly and return results right away. After I get part way through though, the call takes several seconds and then eventually returns an error, which means the update wasnt made and that Im not getting any return bracket results. When I open another page of the site in another tab, it takes awhile to load and eventually I get an error that indicates Im not able to query the database.p  pThis is the code  flow of the processp  pWhen the winning team is clicked, this is calledp  precode.ajax          type POST,         url HandlersTestHandler.ashx,             data  tournamentID tournamentID ,         dataType json,         success function response              switch response[0].toString.toUpperCase                  case SUCCESS                     PopulateBracketresponse                     break                                     default                     alertError setting winner.                     break                      ,         error function               alertError setting winner.               codepre  pThe results from the call are brought back as json and populate the bracket with updated results.p  pInside the handler, I create a new instance of a data access layer class I have created to make querying my db a bit easier.p  pI then perform the necessary logic to determine where teams will go. p  pI attempt to perform an insert record for the winner and loser as well as query for the bracket results in one query.

Im minimizing my database calls to only two per selection of a winner for a match. Im waiting for an ajax call to finish before initiating another call I have an unclosable loading popup appear while the call is being made that goes away once the call is finished  either successfully or not. The bracket also populates with the new results, which is another indicator that the call was successful.p  pWhy is it that after filling out some of the bracket this is happening If I go into the control panel of the hosting solution Im using and restart the website and recycle app pool everything seems to work fine again after a minute.p  pIs it that somehow Im reaching the max pool size for my database connection Any ideas on how this might be happeningp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI didnt spend time researching the problem as I had a similar issue on a page that was attempting to refresh results every 30 seconds via a javascript timer and ajax call. Instead I created an alternative that works. It may not be the most elegant solution but it works.p  pHere it isp  pPlace an update panel on the page.p  pPlace two hidden fields in the update panel. One for the data that will populate the bracket lets say its called HiddenBracketDataBox and one for submission of the winner of a match lets say its called HiddenSubmissionBox.p  pIn the code behind file within PageLoad, I run some code that checks the HiddenSubmissionBox value. If valid not blank, in the correct format, etc, then fire code to post the submission to the database. If HiddenSubmissionBox is empty, nothing fires. At the end of the function, I clear out the HiddenSubmissionBox field so there is no issue with attempts at resubmission.p  pAfter this function I have a function that queries for the bracket data important that this is after the submission code so I pick up the submission and get the most current data that includes the recent submission. This function returns data that I can then dump into the HiddenBracketDataBox field.p  pIn the document.readyfunction   section of my javascript, I call a function lets say its called PopulateData to populate the bracket data by pulling in data from the HiddenBracketDataBox field, processing it, and placing it in the correct bracket positions.p  pAfter calling PopulateData, I perform the following this is to make sure that refreshing the update panel will populate the bracketp  precodetry          Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance.addendRequestEndRequestHandler          catch e   function EndRequestHandlersender, args      PopulateData  codepre  pAnd finally, the last piece of the puzzle is what happens on click of the winning team. For that I set the value of HiddenSubmissionBox to something that indicates what team is being submitted as winner and for what position in the bracket. This is what then gets picked up by the PageLoad code and posted to the db. After setting the HiddenSubmissionBox value, I then call p  precodedoPostBackUpdatePanel1, REFRESH codepre  pto cause the update panel to refresh, which then in turn calls the submission function and gets bracket results that get posted to the hidden field.p  pAnd thats it. Like I said, not the most elegant but it works. I went through and selected winners through a 32 team bracket twice over and never had a single problem. Before I could maybe get through one and little bit of a second at most. This solution lets .net handle the cleanup that is apparently missing as well as maintain the appearance of a page that doesnt refresh.p  pGood luck, were all counting on you. Hope this helps someone.p

Negative 1467 pWe use VS2012, and have a dll built with a dependency on runtime DLL MD. This dll is used in many different projects, and cannot be changed easily.p  pWe also have a small launcher executable that has to able to run on freshly installed systems, hence with no runtime installed. It is linked statically against the runtime MT.p  pNow this exe depends on the above dll. p  pAs is, the exe does not built [1]. I have observed that building it by ignoring MSVCRT NODEFAULTLIBMSVCRT.lib solves [1], but produces [2]. Adding the few symbols reported as errors in force symbol references e.g. INCLUDEstrncpy makes the build succeed.p  pHowever checking the generated exe with Dependency Walker shows the dependency to the runtime DLLs [3] through our dll. I confirmed that the strings [3] are present in it. Trying to run the exe on a clean install of Vista fails the error says a DLL from [3] is missing. I fear that this is not possible, and I have not found any information that suggests that it is.p  pCan a statically linked exe provide runtime functions to a dynamically linked dll If yes, howp  pThanksp  pRefsp  ol li1MSVCRT.libMSVCR110.dll  error LNK2005 sprintf already defined in libcmt.libsprintf.objli lierror LNK2001 unresolved external symbol impstrncpyli liMSVCP110.dll, MSVCR110.dllli ol
Negative 1467 pI have a serialport dataRecived event with 2 methods inside it.

Negative 1467 pI have a Bayesian network where the information flows in both directions, i.e. both from parents and children to a specific node. I would like to have both those information flows included and get a joint probability for each node. While looking around for options to do this analysis I came across Loopy Bayesian Networks. Is someone aware of good examples of data analyses using Loopy Bayesian Networks What I am after is to get a better grip on what the messages flows from children and parents to the focal node can be, and a good example I think could help me with this.p
Negative 1467 pIs it possible to have a textbox ignore kbdCtrlkbd  kbdcharacterkbd function and reassign a different use for the ctrl keyp  pSituation I have multiple text boxes on a Form. Ideally I would like the textboxes to jump from one textbox to another after enter in a single character. However the textbox can have more than one input, in this case I want the user to hold kbdctrlkbd to stay on the textbox while they enter in multiple characters.p  pEssentially, I want my kbdctrlkbd if held down to stop the textbox from jumping.p  pIve tried using a combination of codeOnKeyDowncode, codeOnKeyUpcode and codeTextChangedcode event to handle when the kbdCtrlkbd key is pressed, but in the end, I cant enter any data once the kbdCtrlkbd key is held down. Is there a way around thisp  pThe reason for this is because 95 percent of the time its always 1 character. Therefore to quickly traverse through the textboxes, the user would hit a single character. However in the unlikelihood that the user wants to enter in 2 digits, they can hold kbdCtrlkbd So it doesnt jump to the next textbox and enter in 2 digits as desired.p
Negative 1467 pI work on reports to present financial data.  Ultimately, we need Words advanced content formatting functionality and would like to incorporate Excels ability to manage, collect and query financial data.p  pI have embedded an Excel document into Word as an InlineShape  an OLE object which can be edited and is totally contained in the word doc.  I then have data and reports in separate sheets of that file.  The excel cells can have formulas queries and reports that draw in external information  beautiful.  Up to this point I have everything under control.p  pWhat I would like to do is then to display excerpts from this Excel workbook in separate Inline shapes object using the single workbook object as a single point of reference i.e. not create several disjointed workbook objects with effectively one viewable sheet per inlineshape.p  pCan anyone help me with a solution that allows me to access data from multiple sheets of the single embedded excel file in different inline shape objectp  pfor example  Page 1 p  pexcel table  generic balance sheet report from excel sheet1 page breakp  ppage 2 standalone text developed in word page breakp  ppage 3  excel table detailed listing of asset balances from excel sheet2p  pThe goal is to use an excel workbook to collect data from disparate sources  these are often checked or reconciled.  Then reporting on that data from a single source contained within a word doc.  Ideal solutions would use embedded files because while the external links in cells changes, I would like to remove the barriers of having to link word to a seperate excel files  to use just one excel file source that is prevented from becoming disconnected from the WORD report.p

Negative 1467 pA complex logo Im rendering shows artifacts between the different shapes.

Negative 1467 pThis issue has me vexed.  I am doing some baremetal programming in C for a custom sensor board based on the LPC15XX series microcontrollers.  The platform amounts to a bunch of I2C sensors and a BlueTooth transmitter hooked up to one of the UARTs.  This is NOT one of the LPCxpresso or similar boards it is of a custom design.p  pUntil today, everything was working as expected with all test code in one monolithic file.  As the code grew, I decided to break the main functional pieces into separate source files to easier management.  Unfortunately, as soon as I did this, the program began segfaulting.p  pThe code being moved is a copy  paste of the original monolithic file.  I have stepped through using GDB over a SWD link.  It appears that one of my static variables used to hit the internal ROM drivers is being NULLified.  Dereferencing this later causes the fault.p  pSetting a watch on the static variable, I can see the line of code blowing it up is in the I2C initialization routines.  What is problematic is the fact that init is done using the provided inROM driver routines from NXP.  Furthermore, this same code worked without issue when it was all in the same file.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ul lipWhat would nuke a filelevel static variable like that  To my understanding, the variable shouldnt be on the stack so I dont see a buffer overflow causing this.pli lipWhy would moving the code between files expose this  Shouldnt it all be compiled and linked into a single namespace anywaypli ul  pstrongReplies to Questions in Commentsstrongp  ul lipcodeuartinstancecode is defined once, in codeusart.ccode and only ever directly by name written to once as part of the call to codeuartsetupcode.pli lipLikewise, codei2cinstancecode is defined in codemain.ccode I havent moved the I2C functions yet.

Negative 1467 pI have a function in SpriteKit that spawns a sprite which is a square at the top of the screen, and then gravity pulls the sprite to the bottom of the screen. Im trying to get the sprite to rotate smoothly for an indefinite amount of time until it is removed when it reaches the bottom of the screen.

It takes just like forever At the end, after tens of minutes, it fails to open a given page. Its not a kind of code403code, code404code, which are cases that a server responds. In my case, it seems a server is not giving any information.p  pA stranger thing isp  pIn a such situation, I execute another browser e.g. codeChromecode to codeFirefoxcode, codeFirefoxcode to codeIEcode or codeIEcode to codeChromecode, it works Thus, I dont think my problem is browserspecific, but it is network adapterspecific DNS or a problem on a server side.p  pAnd other users repeatedly report the same problem. Therefore, my final guess is it is a serverside problem. But I have no idea why this happens and how to solve it.p  pAnd this problem is not global. A certain user suffers the problem, but other users are navigating and using a web site normally. Thats very weirdp  pA server uses codeApache 2code, codePHP 5code and codeMySQLcode.

Negative 1467 pSo, this is my first encounter with SuiteCRM or any other CRM for that matter. I need to query the db on a table that is not used by the CRM for our quote system. So, I have created the module using module builder and modified the module file so that it uses the correct table. The problem is that when the query runs, SuiteCRM still adds its default where clauses and adds the deleted  0 condition to the query. So, I tried using the method that is described on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12192010howcaniretrievealltherecordsfromatableinsugarcrmthis SO pagea. That doesnt work as I get the an error that I am using an undefined variable db and that I am calling to a member function fetchByAssoc on a nonobject. Now, I am placing the code in the moduleName.php file. Maybe that is my issue. I dont know as I have never worked on any other CRM project.

The idea was that each WAR would include this JAR, use whatever they need and, then, the WAR would have the specific pages, logos, ...p  pstrongThe problemstrongbr Ive created a simple example just to practice having a JAR file with facelets and having two WAR files including and using these facelets. In this example, things worked flawlessly.p  pNevertheless, the real world is not that simple. Our project also relies on Primefaces, Spring Core and Spring Security, just to mention a few.p  pThe implementation is not yet finished  far from it. Right now, under the same Maven project, Ive created the JAR module, moved the beans and the facelets to that module and included it as a dependency in the WAR file module. p  pThe problem is that, now, my FacesContext.getViewRoot.getViewId tells me that viewId is someName.jsp and not someName.jsf. This simple change messes up with our legacy authentication phase listener a phase listener to ensure that a user is logged in and redirect accordingly implementation.p  pSo, what can be happening here Do any of you have any hint of what my next steps might be in order to track the root source of this problemp  pThanks and regards.p

I think a query like thisp  precodeX.objects.all.valuesy codepre  p...should return a list of dictionaries that contain Y objects, not Y IDs.p  pA query like sop  precodeX.objects.all.valuesyid codepre  p...should return a list of dictionaries containing IDs, because it is what you ask for.p  pDoes anyone agree with mep

Negative 1467 pI could probably setup a couple testbed applications and find out, but Im hoping someone has already experienced this or just simply has a more intuitive understanding.  I have three executables.  Two different clients call them Client1.exe and Client2.exe and a WCF service host call it Host.exe that hosts whats more or less a message bus type service for the two clients.  I wont get into the whys as thats a long story and not productive to this question.  p  pThe point is this, Client1 sends a request through this service to Client2. Client2 performs operations, then responds with results to Client1.  Client1 will always be initiator of requests, so this order of operations will always be consistent this way.  This also means that Client1 can open its channels to communicate to this service asneeded, whereas due to the need of callback services, Client2 has to keep its channels open.  Ive began by attempting to keepalive.  However, these are all three on the desktop and PC sleep events, or other issues not sure seem to interfere with it.  And once it times out, everything has to be restarted which makes it a real pain.  I have some ideas I may try to help the keepalive approach, but this brought up a question that I dont have an answer to... is this the best use of my resources.  p  pThe way I figure it, there are two main approaches for Client2, p  ol liKeepAlive with a lot of monitoring timers and checking of connection states and connection resetting code which would be faster since it could respond to requests immediately.  The downside is this has to be kept alive throughout the time that the user keeps Client2 open on their desktop which could be short and sweet to crazylong.li liPoll periodically for a request which would allow the resources to only be used when checking or processing a request from Client1.  This would be slower since poll requests would not be realtime, but would eliminate any external issue concerns disconnecting the service.  This would also cause me to have to add more state to the service.  Its already a PerSession service with a list of available instances of Client2 IDs so that Client1 knows which instance its talking to, but it would add more.  li ol  pClient2 performs many other functions and so still has to be very performant with this process, which makes me wonder which is most likely to cost in resources  Is the polling approach more costly in resources  Or attempting to keepalivep

Negative 1467 pWe have an end to end test suite for our AngularJS app. written using Protractor. The tests are run via a Grunt task. When run locally on a windows command line the tests pass. When we run them on the command line on our CI machine that hosts Bamboo they pass. However when Bamboo runs the grunt task teste2e, they fail. The failures are various timeouts see sample of logs below. Weve tried increasing some of the timeouts but it does not seem to help. Indeed the 30s timeout seems rather large already.p  pIm out of ideas.

So I want to do this like in the example, that is by extending the  ViewGroup...p  pstrongIn this approachstrong, they extend a main ViewGroup with different ViewGroups each corresponding to a layout for a rowstyle.

Negative 1467 pWhile my scenario is pretty specific, I think it speaks to a bigger question in Flux. Components should be simple renderings of data from a store, but what if your component renders a thirdparty component which is stateful How does one interact with this thirdparty component while still obeying the rules of Fluxp  pSo, I have a React app that contains a video player using a hrefhttpsgithub.comclapprclappr relnofollowclappra. A good example is seeking. When I click a location on the progress bar, I want to seek the video player. Here is what I have right now using a hrefhttpsgithub.comrefluxrefluxjs relnofollowRefluxJSa. Ive tried to strip down my code to the most relevant parts.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar PlayerActions  Reflux.createActions[     seek ]  var PlayerStore  Reflux.createStore     listenables [         PlayerActions     ],      onSeekseekTo          this.data.seekTo  seekTo         this.triggerthis.data        var Player  React.createClass     mixins [Reflux.listenToPlayerStore, onStoreChange],      onStoreChangedata          if data.seekTo  this.state.seekTo              window.player.seekdata.seekTo                    apply state         this.setStatedata           componentDidMount           build a player         window.player  new Clappr.Player             source this.props.sourcePath,             chromeless true,             useDvrControls true,             parentId player,             width this.props.width              ,      componentWillUnmount          window.player.destroy         window.player  null     ,      shouldComponentUpdate           if React realized we were manipulating DOM, itd certainly freak out         return false     ,      render          return ltdiv idplayergt       codepre  pThe bug I have with this code is when you try to seek to the same place twice. Imagine the video player continuously playing. Click on the progress bar to seek. Dont move the mouse, and wait a few seconds. Click on the progress bar again on the same place as before. The value of codedata.seekTocode did not change, so codewindow.player.seekcode is not called the second time.p  pIve considered a few possibilities to solve this, but Im not sure which is more correct. Input requested...p  pbrp  pstrongem1 Reset codeseekTocode after it is usedemstrongp  pSimply resetting codeseekTocode seems like the simplest solution, though its certainly no more elegant. Ultimately, this feels more like a bandaid.p  pThis would be as simple as ...p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodewindow.player.onplayerseek, PlayerActions.resetSeek codepre  pbrp  pstrongem2 Create a separate store that acts more like a passthroughemstrongp  pBasically, I would listen to a codeSeekStorecode, but in reality, this would act as a passthrough, making it more like an action that a store. This solution feels like a hack of Flux, but I think it would work.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar PlayerActions  Reflux.createActions[     seek ]  var SeekStore  Reflux.createStore     listenables [         PlayerActions     ],      onSeekseekTo          this.triggerseekTo        var Player  React.createClass     mixins [Reflux.listenToSeekStore, onStoreChange],      onStoreChangeseekTo          window.player.seekseekTo       codepre  pbrp  pstrongem3 Interact with codewindow.playercode within my actionsemstrongp  pWhen I think about it, this emfeelsem correct, since calling codewindow.player.seekcode is in fact an action. The only weird bit is that I dont feel right interacting with codewindowcode inside the actions. Maybe thats just an irrational thought, though.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar PlayerActions  Reflux.createActions     seek asyncResult true  PlayerActions.seek.listenseekTo gt      if window.player          try              window.player.seekseekTo             PlayerActions.seek.completederr          catch err              PlayerActions.seek.failederr               else          PlayerActions.seek.failednew Errorplayer not initialized       codepre  pBTW, theres a whole other elephant in the room that I didnt touch on. In all of my examples, the player is stored as codewindow.playercode. Clappr did this automatically in older versions, but though it has since been fixed to work with Browserify, we continue to store it on the codewindowcode tech debt. Obviously, my third solution is leveraging that fact, which it technically a bad thing to be doing. Anyway, before anyone points that out, understood and noted.p  pbrp  pstrongem4 Seek via codedispatchEventcodeemstrongp  pI also understand that dispatching a custom event would get the job done, but this feels way wrong considering I have Flux in place. This feels like Im going outside of my Flux architecture to get the job done. I should be able to do it and stay inside the Flux playground.p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar PlayerActions  Reflux.createActions     seek asyncResult true  PlayerActions.seek.listenseekTo gt      try          let event  new window.CustomEventseekEvent, detail seekTo         window.dispatchEventevent         PlayerActions.seek.completederr      catch err          PlayerActions.seek.failederr        var Player  React.createClass     componentDidMount          window.addEventListenerseekEvent, this.onSeek     ,     componentWillUnmount          window.removeEventListenerseekEvent, this.onSeek     ,     onSeeke          window.player.seeke.detail       codepre

Negative 1467 pHow can I determine actual physical RAM used by some processp  pI can look into codeprocPIDstatuscode on codeVmRSScode or into codetopcodes codeREScode column. However, this number is incorrect for the processes which use multiple mappings backed by the same file. For example, the following piece of code maps several areas into a small physical memory window.p  precodesizet windowsize  ...  e.g. 128 MiB sizet totalsize  ...   e.g. 4 TiB  char path[]  devshmwindowXXXXXX  int fd  mkstemppath  ftruncatefd, offtwindowsize  void data  mmapNULL, totalsize, PROTREADPROTWRITE, MAPPRIVATEMAPANONYMOUSMAPNORESERVE, 1, 0  forptrdifft offset  0 offset lt ptrdiffttotalsize offset  windowsize      mmap void  uintptrtdata  offset , windowsize, PROTREADPROTWRITE, MAPFIXEDMAPSHAREDMAPNORESERVE, fd, 0  codepre  pNow, if I look into codeprocPIDstatuscode, the kernel reports codeVmRSScode as a sum of all the windows above. Although this number is even higher than the total physical memory size.p

Negative 1467 pBy default, Embercli automatically concatenates JavaScript files into codevendor.jscode and codeapplication.jscode or codeltAPPNAMEgt.jscode. This makes tracebacks much less helpful.

Negative 1467 pIm using Teleriks Kendo suite and I need to perform a check on each cell in the Scheduler control.  I do this by searching for an attribute called role and doing an .each on them.  This works fine, but if I have multiple schedulers on the page I dont want to iterate over all tds...just ones in a specific scheduler which is an html table under the hood. I tried giving the scheduler an ID, but the selector doesnt seem to find any tds. When I just use td[rolegridcell].each it works but comes back with all tds in the page.  If I try adding the id of the scheduler I want, it comes back with nothing.p  precodevar scheduler  scheduler.datakendoScheduler var view  scheduler.view view.table.findscheduler td[rolegridcell].eachfunction index, value       Do checking here.  codepre  pIm sure theres an issue with my syntax in the selector but I cant figure it out.p
