Positive 35311 pagain this question but now with codep  pIve got a deployed ASP.NET MVC website on an IIS7.5.

Positive 35311 pSo to start, we have a Windows Server 2008 R2 running multiple websites under our main domain, so it will be domain.comsite.  The sites were created by someone else using mainly PHP, with a few ASP.Net pages, and only the ASP.Net pages broke after we installed SharePoint 2013 on our server SharePoint was not installed on it before.p  pThe main issue we first saw was a configuration error referencing a problem connecting to the SharePoint farm, which was the application pool in IIS was using user credentials that could not access a part of SharePoint.  This is most likely a configuration somewhere, but I could not find out where wasnt in Global Web.Config, Machine.Config, or any Web.Config i could find.p  pBecause the User Credentials fixed that error, we received another config error that said codePlatformNotSupportedException Operation is not supported on this platform.code  This pointed to the application pool being set to classic instead of integrated, and heres where Im at.  If I set the application pool which is .Net v4.0 btw to Integrated, the error goes away, but the entire site outside of SharePoint pulls up blank.  In the developer tools in Chrome, all i see is a 500 error Internal Server Error and nothing else.p  pIf I set the application pool back to classic, the PHP pages will load up fine, but the ASPX pages will load up with the codePlatformNotSupportedExceptioncode error.p  pException information p  precodeException type PlatformNotSupportedException  Exception message Operation is not supported on this platform.  at System.Web.HttpServerVarsCollection.SetString name, String value at Microsoft.SharePoint.IdentityModel.SPTokenCache.ReadTokenByte[] token at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.SessionSecurityTokenHandler.ReadTokenByte[] token, SecurityTokenResolver tokenResolver at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.ReadSessionTokenFromCookieByte[] sessionCookie at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.TryReadSessionTokenFromCookieSessionSecurityTokenamp sessionToken at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.OnAuthenticateRequestObject sender, EventArgs eventArgs at Microsoft.SharePoint.IdentityModel.SPSessionAuthenticationModule.OnAuthenticateRequestObject sender, EventArgs eventArgs at System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStepIExecutionStep step, Booleanamp completedSynchronously codepre  pIn this exception message, it references SharePoint configurations the site is not using.

Positive 35311 pI have an ASP.NET site with a news system and I have currently added folders with static content basic HTML with images in order to provide a preview for a newsletter. I am getting the usual 404 error even though the new folder with the static content exists. Also, other folders with static content work OK and updating any previous static HTML does not work so Im guessing its a server cache issue. I have recycled the AppPool and restarted the Website to no avail.p  pAny other ideas as to what to checkp
Positive 35311 pi have a question on how IIS handle requests for web application and mainly for asp.net mvc. now let say i have the following action method , which can be called from a user browser p  precodePublic ActionResult Test string test, string test2  var a  context.singleOrDefaultagta.ID test var b  context.Table.tolist a.NameNewName var b  context.SingleOrDefaulta2gta2.ID  test2 b.status  active context.SaveChanges return View  codepre  pnow when a user calls the action method as followp  precodehttpsservernamecontrollernameTesttest1amptest22 codepre  pwill this be the IIS execution scenario p  ol lione of the available IIS threads will handle the request.li lithe same thread will populate the value value for var a , and execute all the operations , save changes amp return the viewli lithe iis thread will be released.li ol  psecond question. now let say instead of calling this action method from the browser, i am calling this action method from the codeglobal.asaxcode file on a timely basis as followp  precodepublic class MvcApplication  System.Web.HttpApplication              static void ScheduleTaskTrigger                      HttpRuntime.Cache.AddScheduledTaskTrigger,                                   string.Empty,                                   null,                                   Cache.NoAbsoluteExpiration,                                   TimeSpan.FromMinutes10,                                    CacheItemPriority.NotRemovable,                                   new CacheItemRemovedCallbackPerformScheduledTasks            static void PerformScheduledTasksstring key, Object value, CacheItemRemovedReason reason                         HomeController h  new HomeController            var c  h.Test1,2              ScheduleTaskTrigger          codepre  pso in this case will IIS be involved  in the action method execution, as when i am calling the action method from the codeglobal.asaxcode there will not be any Request,, so does this mean that iis will not get affected  in other words no IIS thread will be occupied when i call an action method from codeglobal.asaxcode or since the web application is deployed under IIS so also background jobs executions will still happen inside IIS threads p

Application has Forms and Anonymous authentication enabled. They cant be switched off for many reasons Under one of the application subfolders I have an .aspx file that should be accessed only via windows authenticated users domain administrators, specific users group etc. To solve this I need to somehow disable the access to this file unless user can provide windows credentials.p  ol liWindows authentication cant be used simultaneously with Forms authentication. And Im unable to turn off forms authentication for that filesubfolder as it can be done only on application level.li liDisabling access for anonymous logon to that file via Authorization rules section gives me redirection to my form that is used for authorization. So this also isnt a solution.li liRemoving IISIUSR within NTFS permissions gives me access denied error. li ol  pQuestion Is there any way, how I could give access to that file only in case if a user provides windows credentials. p  pNote No code changes or file movement is allowed for this. This should be done only by configuration. p

Positive 35311 pAdditionaly to the infamous slowstart problem, which occurrs in ASP.NET application running on IIS, we experience another one.p  pAfter a fresh application start e.g. iisreset the first request takes some time as usual. However in the current application every other request to a page that hasnt been loaded yet takes about 1012 second on the first hitp  pAfter the page has loaded, all other requests to the same resource are fast again 80130 ms usually. This is also true to first loads of from other client machines, so this is not a clientcaching problem.p  pFor examplep  precodeMachine  Request            Duration  A        GET               43000 ms  wakeup A        GET                  90 ms  B        GET                  90 ms  A        GET registration  12000 ms  A        GET registration    110 ms  A        GET registration    110 ms  A        GET registration    110 ms  A        GET foobar        11000 ms  A        GET foobar           85 ms  B        GET baz           10000 ms  A        GET baz             100 ms  codepre  pThe interesting thing is that this doesnt happen when we run the application on our DEV machines debugtrue, etc. Only when we publish the website debugfalse, precompile, etc this behaviour occurrs. p  pAll static resources are bundled and cached properly and there is not one request that may take more than 1 second really.

Positive 35311 pI am having problem with Microsoft LightSwitch. I am using .Net framework 4.0. Few days back my application was working fine hosted under IIS. But now application started getting stuck on every save requesteven a simple table screen, with only 5 total rows causing problem. I am not sure why this happened, might we have installed some updates. I faced same issue on 2 machines out of 10.p  pEven I tried remove my application and rehost in IIS. Even repair .Net framework but no success.p  pEach machine has its own local copy with SQL 2008 EXPRESS versions installed. And after a time period may be 35 minutes only a popup appeared with this error messagep  pstrongAn unexpected error occurred while communicating with the server.  Please contact a network administrator.strongp  pOne more thing, if this could clarify, when the above mentioned error message appeared, in the background it also saves my changes in database. But if I put some custom code apart from simple saving, that custom code is not running. Means it only saves the current entitys contentchanges and no other work is done. I also tried to just remove that custom code, but still getting the same STUCK problem  error message, with entitys changes saved successfully in the background.p  pI am just getting mad with this problem, I will highly appreciate if I could get some solution.p

Positive 35311 pI have a client calling my IIS 7.5 web server. Only intermittently, the client is receiving a 417 status code expectation failed from my web server. What would be the root cause of this issuep  pIve seen some posts about Expect100Continue, but if that were the case, I dont know why the client would fail intermittently.p  pEDIT As requested, intermittently means that most requests succeed hundreds. Weve had about 5 incidents that did not. All requests are coming from the same client. All GETs have been succeeding. Most POSTs do as well but a few do not. Only one environment are we seeing this issue, but that environment has had the largest load. The web server gets pegged with small requests that generate large JSON data. About an hour into the sequential requests, this error occurs.p

Negative 35311 pIm using the Yahoo Uploader, part of the Yahoo UI Library, on my ASP.Net website to allow users to upload files. For those unfamiliar, the uploader works by using a Flash applet to give me more control over the FileOpen dialog.  I can specify a filter for file types, allow multiple files to be selected, etc. Its great, but it has the following documented limitationp  blockquote   pBecause of a known Flash bug, the Uploader running in Firefox in Windows does not send the correct cookies with the upload instead of sending Firefox cookies, it sends Internet Explorers cookies for the respective domain. As a workaround, we suggest either using a cookieless upload method or appending document.cookie to the upload request.p blockquote  pSo, if a user is using Firefox, I cant rely on cookies to persist their session when they upload a file. I need their session because I need to know who they are As a workaround, Im using the Application object thuslyp  precodeGuid UploadID  Guid.NewGuid Application.AddGuid.ToString, User codepre  pSo, Im creating a unique ID and using it as a key to store the codePage.Usercode object in the Application scope. I include that ID as a variable in the POST when the file is uploaded. Then, in the handler that accepts the file upload, I grab the User object thuslyp  precodeIPrincipal User  IPrincipalApplication[Request.Form[uploadid]] codepre  pThis actually works, but it has two glaring drawbacks p  ul lipIf IIS, the app pool, or even just the application is restarted between the time the user visits the upload page, and actually uploads a file, their uploadid is deleted from application scope and the upload fails because I cant authenticate them.pli lipIf I ever scale to a web farm possibly even a web garden scenario, this will completely break. I might not be worried, except I do plan on scaling this app in the future.pli ul  pDoes anyone have a better way Is there a way for me to pass the actual ASP.Net session ID in a POST variable, then use that ID at the other end to retrieve the sessionp  pI know I can get the session ID through codeSession.SessionIDcode, and I know how to use YUI to post it to the next page. What I dont know is how to use that codeSessionIDcode to grab the session from the state server.p  pYes, Im using a state server to store the sessions, so they persist applicationIIS restarts, and will work in a web farm scenario.p

Negative 35311 pWe have a webpage that we provide to partner companies via an iFrame.  The iFrame contains several javascript files that make ajax requests to our server for data.  The iFrame itself requires an API Key that is keyed to the domain of the partner.  This prevents the iFrame from displaying if it is installed on a domain that isnt registered.  However, it would be pretty easy to simply copy the contents and javascript files of the iFrame from a registered site and host them on a nonregistered site.  p  pIdeally wed like to use the API key to restrict Ajax requests and prevent our server from providing the requested data for nonregistered sites.  However, it appears that the HTTPREFERER server variable is not set for Ajax requests.  How can we tell what site that the request is coming from  Is it possible  If not, how can we prevent unauthorized access  p

Negative 35311 pIf I have a set of tiles squares which can be any number and they are to fill a container rectangle of an unknown size how do I work out the maximum size of the tiles without having any of them overlap.p  pSo if I have 2 tiles and the rectangle is 100  100 then the max tile size is 50  50.  This would also be the max size of tile if there was 3 or 4 tiles for this size of rectanlgle, which just so happens to be a square in this example.p  pIf the rectanlge was 100  30 and I had 2 tiles, the max size of the square would be 30  30, if I have 4 tiles the max size would be 25  25.p  pHow can I do this programatically without hogging the processor by going through every possible combination.p  phr p  pI try to summarise a bit better,  I have ap  prectanglebounding box that I need to fill as much as possible without the tiles overlapping.p  pI know the height and width of the rectangle but this can change during runtime.p  pI have X number of tiles this can change at run time, these are squares.p  pNone of the tiles should overlap, what is the maximum size that each tile can be.

Negative 35311 pI am currently attempting to refactor an application that has a lot of places where it displays lists  or tables of data, with totals or averages at the end, and percentage changes or cumulative totals with each record.p  pTypically the collection is modelled as a list of objects and the other data is calculated in the aspx code behind yuck. I would like to move this logic into my model in order to make it testable and reusable.p  pThe best I can come up with at the moment is to create a collection class that all these objects are added to. This collection can then expose properties that represent various statistics. Like thisp  precodepublic class DailySales      public DateTime Date  get set      public decimal Value  get set    public class SalesCollection      public ListltDailySalesgt Sales  get private set       public decimal TotalSales              get  return Sales.Sumx gt x.Value        codepre  pThis works well for totals. But now I need to calculate a change for each day. I can add this to the daily sales, and then update it from the collection class which also seems to work quite well. Except it makes persisting it with Nhibernate rather difficult as there is no way to fire events from the Sales list that the SalesCollection can hook into and calculate the other statistics.p  pI guess what I am lookin for is a clean way of modelling this kind of data, that can be persisted to Nhibernate easily.p

Negative 35311 pIve taken over development for a site that was started to be built in Joomla.  So far, there is just a few static pages and user registration.

The admins and only admins will add files and the users will be able to download some of those files from the Members Area based on the current date.p  pFrom my limited experience with Joomla in the past few hours it seems to me that Joomla is good for having a semistatic website where nontechnical admins can addedit content but it doesnt seem good for being able to add customized dynamic content I havent been able to figure out yet how I can add a new page where I can access the database.p  pI am thinking to propose the current Joomla site be scratched and start over with a PHP framework instead so it can be customized.

Im trying to strip the data down in to the format of values that can then be plotted. The 17 bytes of data is currently coming in at 256 framessec. The two channels are made up 10 bits of data each with 6 zeros to make up the rest of the 2 bytes. They are unsigned giving possible values of 0 to 1023.

Negative 35311 pI am working on a J2EE server application which is deployed on Tomcat. I use Spring source as MVC framework and Hibernate as ORM provider. My object model has lot of Lazy relationships dependent objects are fetched on request. The high level design is like Service level methods call a few DAO methods to perform database operation. The service method is called either from the Flex UI or as a scheduled job. When it is called from Flex UI, the service method works fine i.e. it fetches some objects using DAO methods and even Lazy loading works. This is possible by the use of OpenSessionInViewFilter configured with the UI servlet.p  pBut when the same service method is called as scheduled Job, it gives LazyInitializationException. I can not configure OpenSessionInViewFilter because there is no servlet or UI request associated with that. p  pI tried configuring Transaction around the scheduled job method so that service method starts a transaction and all the DAO methods participate in that same transaction, hoping that the transaction will remain active and hibernate session will be available. But it does not work.p  pPlease suggest if anyone has ever been able to get such a configuration working. If needed, I can post the Hibernate configuration and log messages.p  pThanks a lot for helpp  pShreerangp
Negative 35311 pHeres the specsp  ul liASP.NET 3.5 using ASP.NET AJAXli liAJAX Control Toolkitli lijQuery 1.3.2li liweb servicesli liIIS6 on Windows Server 2003 SP1li liSP1 SQLServer 2005 SP3 Site is SSLli liInfragistics Web Components 2009 Vol. 2 using nonAikido controls, UltraWebGrid and Tree control are main ones used.li ul  pHeres the problem Im getting the White Screen of Death WSOD in IE 78. Basically, I have a page that has a left pane that has an AJAXControl Toolkit Accordion control where each accordion panes content is an Infragistics Tree Control. The right pane is a codeltdivgtcode that has an codeltiframegtcode whose content is reloaded based on whats clicked in the left menu pane.p  pIn the codeltiframegtcode, a page with one or more UltraWebGrid controls loads up when you click on a menu item in the left pane. The grids all havea templated button column. When you click on the edit button of a grid row a popup window to edit the record is opened. This works fine for about ten times and then on the tenth time sometimes earlier, the popup window opens with the correct URL in the address bar, but the page never loads. p  pWe have an application that uses one popup window for updating records. Most of the time when you click on the [Edit] button to edit a record, the popup window opens and loads the update page. However, after editing records for a while, all of a sudden the popup window will open, but it stays blank and just hangs. The URL is in the address bar.p  pLoading up Fiddler I noticed that the request for the update page is never sent which leads me to believe its some kind of lockup on the clientside. If I copy the same URL thats in the popup window into a new browser window, the page generally loads fine.p  pObservations   Since the request is never sent to the server, its definitely something clientside or browser related.   Only appears to happen when there is some semblance of traffic on the site which is weird because this appears to be contained within clientside code   There is a web service being called in the background every few seconds checking if the user is logged on, but this doesnt cause the freeze.p  pIm really at a loss here. Ive googled WSOD but not much seems to appear related to my specific WSOD. Any ideasp  pstrongWhat the problem really isstrongp  pSo turns out the memory leaks although Ive sealed up some on the clientside are not the issue. The issue is web service calls being made on the clientside. There is one that checks if a user is logged on every 4 seconds to synchronize with another window and then there are web service calls to get user preferences for a popup window and grid state. From what Ive read, the web services have to be asynchronous. I assumed by calling them from JavaScript with successfail callbacks that they were asynchronous but they really arent. Theyre asynchronous from the clientsidebrowser point of view, but from the serverside, the call to the web service is made and returns when it is completed holding up any other operations since there is a limited number of connections.p  pSo what is the easiest way to just make the web service methods asynchronous Does the web service need to be converted to a WCF web service or can I use my existing ASP.NET web service call p  pstrongAnd for historical purposes, heres what I thought the problem was originallystrongp  pI wasnt able to reproduce this locally or on our testing servers. However, I got Fiddler to simulate modem speeds and all of sudden I can replicate the WSOD on my local PC. So it appears to be a slow or temporarily slow connection when opening a popup window that causes it to choke, at least in my test environment.p  pI did another test running IE without addons, codeiexplore.exe extoffcode, but end up with the same result. I also fixed an issue where the iframe on the page was being recreated everytime the URL for the iframe changed. Part of my logic was omitted. Now the iframe is only created once. After that only the codesrccode attribute is updated when I want to load new content... my goof. I noticed some lingering window references in JavaScript closures, so now those are explicitly set to null in the closures when Im done with them.p  pIve also done some memory leak investigation   As far as I can tell I do not have any circular references in the DOM and JavaScript or the other leak patterns mentioned here, a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksweblibrarywamemleakSTACT105AGX52ampSCMPcnawa relnofollowhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksweblibrarywamemleakSTACT105AGX52ampSCMPcnawaap  ul lipIve  added the Crockenators purge code for IE memory leaks see a hrefhttpwww.crockford.comjavascriptmemoryleak.html relnofollowhttpwww.crockford.comjavascriptmemoryleak.htmlap  pdocument.readyfunction      function purged          var a  d.attributes, i, l, np  precode    if a          l  a.length   precode    for i  0 i amplt l i  1          if a[i]              n  a[i].name               if typeof d[n]  function                  d[n]  null                 purgeCount                               a  d.childNodes   if a      l  a.length     for i  0 i amplt l i  1          purged.childNodes[i]               codepre             window.unloadfunction    purgedocument.body   alertpurge count   purgeCount  codepre  ppli ul  pNone of my improvements have fixed the problem. in my local test scenario. Any ideas Anyone Anyone Buellerp  pstrongLast Updatestrongp  pThanks David for pointing out that it was session state causing the problems in the web services. strongASP.NET queues all requests to the same session.

Negative 35311 pI have a two tier Delphi for Win32 application with a lot of business logic implemented in a god object I want to outsource into a separate service. This separate service should be accessed by multiple clients via TCPIP telnetstyle protocol.p  pHow do I go about making the transition most simplep  pPrecisely, Id like to keep this simplicity I want to define every function just once. For example, if I want to add a pin code Login functionality to my app, I would just need to define thep  precode function LoginUsername string PinCode integer boolean codepre  pfunction in some object on the server, then I can use it from clients without any additional work.p  pIn the worst case, I have to implement three functions instead of one. First, the function body itself on the server, second, the unmarshaller which receives a text line from network, unpacks it and checks for validityp  precode procedure HandleCommandCmd string Params array of string  begin    ...    if SameTextCmd, Login then begin      CheckParamCountParams, 2      ServerObject.Login        Params[0],        StrToIntParams[1]          end  end codepre  pThird, the marshaller, which when called by client, packs the params and sends them to serverp  precodefunction TServerConnection.LoginUsername string PinCode integer boolean begin   Result  StrToBoolServerCallLogin EscapeUsername IntToStrPinCode end codepre  pObviously, I dont want this.p  pSo far I have managed to rid myself of the unmarshaller. Working with Delphi RTTI, I wrote a generic unmarshaller which looks for a published method by name, checks the params and calls it.p  pSo now I can just add a published method to the server object and Im able to call it from telnetp  precode function LoginUsername string PinCode integer boolean   gt login johnlocke  Missing parameter 2 PinCode integer codepre  pBut what do I do about writing a marshaller I cant dynamically fetch server function list and add functions to the client object. I can probably keep some kind of dynamic pseudofunction collection but that would make my client calls uglyp  precodeServerConnection.CallLogin, [Username, Password] codepre  pPlus, this defeats typesafety as every parameter is passed as a variant. If possible, Id like to keep compiletime typesafety.p  pMaybe client code autogeneration I can probably write GetFunctionList and GetFunctionPrototypeName string in my serverp  precodegt GetFunctionList Login Logout IsLoggedIn  gt GetFunctionPrototype Login function LoginUsername string PinCode integer boolean codepre  pSo that every time I need to update the client, I just requery all the function prototypes from the server and automatically generate marshaller code for them. But that would mix compilation with execution Id have to first compile the server, then start it and query its functions, then build a client marshaller and recompile client only after that. Complicatedp  pAnother option is to write a generic marshaller function and then call it from all the client prototype functionsp  precodeprocedure TServerConnection.GenericMarshaller assembler asm   finds the RTTI for the caller function, unwinds stack, pops out caller params,   packs them according to RTTI and sends to the server.   receives the result, pushes it to stack according to RTTI, quits   oh god end  function TServerConnection.LoginUsername string PinCode integer boolean assembler asm   call GenericMarshaller end codepre  pThis saves me writing manual packaging every time less chance for errors, but still requires me to manually copy server function prototypes into the client object. Plus, writing this generic marshaller is probably going to be a living hell.p  pThen theres the option of using RPC, but I dont like it because Id need to redefine all the functions in IDL. And Delphis IDL editor sucks. And for OLE interfaces Delphi forcefully generates safecall functions which suck, too. And theres no way to implement autodetectdisconnect and autorestoreconnection functionality other than checking EVERY SINGLE function call to the RPC classp  precodefunction TServerWrapper.LoginUsername string PinCode integer boolean begin   try     RealObject.LoginUsername, Pincode   except     on E EOleException do       if IndicatesDisconnectE then         Disconnect       Reconnect       RealObject.LoginUsername, Pincode   end end codepre  pWere back to several functions instead of one.p  pSo, what would you guys suggest What are the other choices Im missing Are there common patterns or ready solutions for remoting in Delphip

The post page never actually executes its code though and the post should return nothing, thus causing the control to ask for the FinalUrl.p  pUsing Fiddler I can see that the manageDocumentsPost causes a redirect, and this redirect has a different Asp.Net SessionId.p  pAny ideas what might have changed to cause this  More importantly, any ideas to get it functioning againp  pThanks Andyp

If I hang up the call using tapitool then I  still dont get a callback to TryToSendUDPPacket, also if I try to recall the simulator again using tapi tool again nothing happens i.e. PhoneEventCallback doesnt get called a 2nd time.p  pIf I change the  code slightly and add a call to TryToSendUDPPacket in the EVTAPPSTART switch, then the packet is initially sent successfully, but then if I use the tapi tool to try and call the device nothing happens  i.e. PhoneEventCallback doesnt get called.p  pPerhaps a relevant point to note is that in both instances when PhoneEventCallBack doesnt get called, the tapi tool also does not update its output window contents, normally it would display information saying such things as receiving incomming call.This suggests to me there is a problem or limitation with Brewthe simulator itself and its not possible to combine socket use and telephone calls simultaneously.Is this correct or is there some other issuep

Negative 35311 pUnlike Windows, GNOME and most other GUIs, OS X application programs do not all terminate if the main window or all the windows of that application are closed. p  pFor example, fire up Firefox, Safari, Word, or most document based apps. Either click the red dot in the corner or type kbdcmdkbdkbdWkbd to close the window. You can see that the menu of that program is still active, and the program is still running. With OS X newbies, sometimes you will see dozens of these windowless zombies running and they wonder why their computer is getting slower.p  pWith some document based programs, there is some sense to not terminating the application if it has no windows. For example, with Safari or Word, you can still type kbdCmdkbdkbdNkbd and get a new document window for whatever that application was designed to do browse the web Safari or type a new document Word.p  pApple is mixed with their design philosophy on this. Some close on the last window closed and some do not. Third party apps are even more mixed. p  pThere are other apps that do close when their red close button is clicked. System Preferences, Dictionary, the Mac App Store, iPhoto and Calculator do terminate when the sole or last window is closed. iCal, Address Book, iTunes, DVD Player do not terminate. p  pWhat I find particularly annoying is the applications that do not have a logical New Document or Open function yet they do not terminate when the document window is closed. Example fire up iTunes or Address Book and terminate the main window. There sits a zombie with no window and no function other than manually selecting Quit.p  pIt is easy to close the application after the last window closes. Cocoa even gives you notification of that event. Just add this to your application delegatep  precode   BOOLapplicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosedNSApplication sender      return YES  codepre  pMy question is this Is there any reason I should NOT terminate my application after the last window closes Why is this so variable on OS X software Unless the app has a new or open or some other clearly understood reason to not terminate with no window open, the failure to terminate seems like a bug to me. p

Negative 35311 pI have an interesting problem. Im creating a revisions system for my application. The way it works is that every time a new post object is created, the post object attempts to create a history record for each one of its attributes that has changed.p  pSo if the post.subject was edited, a new revision record is created in a history table. It will only store the new subject text as well as the associated post, and user who made it. If more than one attribute is changed, theyre passed in an array and each attribute will be stored in its own record, grouped by a UUID.p  pTo cut down on excess records, the history object will attempt to find any existing revisions and update them codeif the existing revisions are younger than a certain time limit.code This way we can keep changes made in a short timespan in the same revision. If theyre not younger, then new revisions are created.p  pstrongScenariostrong p  ol liUser Foo changes the subject on a post a subject revision is created.li liUser Foo goes back and changes the body and the subject existing subject revision is updated a new body revision is created.

Throw the single socket its better to request the images all together at the begin of connection and later send all the images in a serial way one to one, or throw the single socket send a image request get the image reply, after request the second image and get the second reply.p  pIf I use multiple sockets, one socket for each image request I want to have a maximum number of open sockets, may I use an threadpool and use one runnable to manage one image transfer throw one socketp  pThank you again.p

The interval may vary as regular as every day to every 30 days.p  p2 For each site from step 1 that fits the pull schedule criteria, I need to fetch data from it via HTTP GET again, it might be all of them or as few as 2 or 3 sites. Once I get the response back from the site, parse the result and save this data into the datastore as [Table1].p  p3 For all of the data that was recently put into the datastore in [Table1] theyll have a special flag, I need to issue additional HTTP request to a 3rd party site to do some additional processing. As soon as I receive data from this site, I store all of the relevant info into another table [Table2] in the datastore.p  p4 As soon as data is available and ready from step 3, I need to take all of it and perform some additional transformation and update the original table [Table1] in the datastore. p  pIm not certain which of the different components I need to use to ensure that I can complete each piece of the work without exceeding the response deadline thats placed on the web requests of GAE.

While setting up the scene, I create the buffers and the texture neededp    pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeint width  768 int height  270   Prepare texture for offscreen rendering. glGenTextures1, ampwTexture glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, wTexture glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLLINEAR glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLLINEAR glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPS, GLCLAMPTOEDGE glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREWRAPT, GLCLAMPTOEDGE glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLGENERATEMIPMAP, GLFALSE glClearColor.9f, .3f, .6f, 1.0f  DEBUG glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA, width, height, 0, GLRGBA,   GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, 0 glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, 0   Depth attachment buffer, always needed. glGenRenderbuffersOES1, ampwDepth glBindRenderbufferOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, wDepth glRenderbufferStorageOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, GLDEPTHCOMPONENT16OES,   width, height glBindRenderbufferOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, 0   Create FBO for rendertotexture. glGenFramebuffersOES1, ampwBuffer glBindFramebufferOESGLFRAMEBUFFEROES, wBuffer glFramebufferTexture2DOESGLFRAMEBUFFEROES,   GLCOLORATTACHMENT0OES, GLTEXTURE2D, wTexture, 0 glFramebufferRenderbufferOESGLFRAMEBUFFEROES,   GLDEPTHATTACHMENTOES, GLRENDERBUFFEROES, wDepth glBindFramebufferOESGLFRAMEBUFFEROES, 0 codepre  pA codeglFramebufferStatusOEScode on the new FBO before it is unbound of course yields a framebuffer complete return value on both the simulator and the device. Note that I set the pink clear colour for the texture in order to confirm that the texture is actually rendered, and the problem is in fact simply that the texture is never drawn into.p  pWhenever the texture needs to be redrawn, I do this before rendering the elementp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeglBindFramebufferOESGLFRAMEBUFFEROES, wBuffer glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT glViewport0, 0, width, height glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW glPushMatrix  ... codepre  pand the following after the actual renderingp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecode ... glPopMatrix glBindFramebufferOESGLFRAMEBUFFEROES, 0 codepre  pFinally, every time the screen is redrawn I map the texture to a quad at the appropriate position on the screen, like sop  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodefloat Vertices[]     65.0f, 100.0f, .0f,   65.0f, 100.0f, .0f,   10.0f, 100.0f, .0f,   10.0f, 100.0f, .0f float Texture[]  .0f, .0f, 1.0f, .0f, .0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f  glEnableGLTEXTURE2D glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glEnableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY  glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, wTexture glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA  glVertexPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, Vertices glTexCoordPointer2, GLFLOAT, 0, Texture glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLESTRIP, 0, 4  glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glDisableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY glDisableGLTEXTURE2D  glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, 0 codepre  pOn the iPhone and iPad simulators 4.2, 4.3, the code works as expected. I see the dynamically rendered texture displayed at the respective position, of course with a pink instead of a transparent background due to my debugging statement. On my iPad 4.2 device, however, only the pink rectangle is rendered, not what should have been drawn into it during the rendertotexture step. Thus, the texture is rendered to the screen correctly, but for some reason, on the device the rendertotexture code fails to actually render anything to the texture.p  pI suppose I am using some functionality that is not available on the device, or make an erroneus assumption somewhere, but I cant figure out what it is. I also tried running it through the OpenGL ES Analyzer, but it gives me nothing but some basic performance optimisation tips. Where do I need to look for the problemp

Negative 35311 pIn an application Im working on Ive created a lightweight logger which has two purposes. Errors logged with the enum Domain will get logged to a database, whilst errors logged with the enum Application can be pulled from a service to be displayed to a user.p  pIm using ninject InRequestScope to allow for the error collection to be maintained over the scope of the request.p  pOne issue Im uncertain about is when should I call the function to log errors to the database. This function pushes all errors into the DB using a Transaction. An idea I had was to make the error logger use IDisposable and then call the LogErrorsToDatabase method from the Dispose method.p  pAre there any issues with doing thisp  pWill ninject automatically call dispose, or do I need to configure it to do sop  pI first tried to inject the service into Global.asax, but this had unforseen issues.p  pstrongEDITstrong I found a way to do this more elegantly, so for future reference, Ill detail it below.p  pI first created a custom action filter and used property injection to inject the IErrorLog servicep  precodepublic class LogErrorsAttribute  ActionFilterAttribute      [Inject]     public IErrorQueue ErrorQueue  private get set       public override void OnResultExecutedResultExecutedContext filterContext              ErrorQueue.CommitDatabaseLog         base.OnResultExecutedfilterContext       codepre  pI next used Ninjects BindFilter method to bind this function to every called actionp  precode BindFilterltLogErrorsAttributegtFilterScope.Last, 0 codepre  pEverything works perfectly and cleanly now.p  pFinal Edit I noticed someone has upvoted this recently, so they might have used the solution I found. I did discover a bug with the solution in the last edit. It seems that my navigation controller was firing this function, at the point that the navigation fired, no errors had occured, this wrote to the filtercontext and stopped it functioning when called by the action later down the chain. To resolve this, I used the following binding codep  precodekernel.BindFilterltLogErrorsAttributegtFilterScope.Last, 0.When             context, ad gt string.IsNullOrEmptyad.ActionName ampamp ad.ControllerDescriptor.ControllerName.ToLower  navigation codepre  pThis stops the filter being fired by any navigation code partial views being rendered from the controller.p

Negative 35311 pIm working on an enormous applet, loads over 100 jars, 50 of which are thirdparty.  All of them are signed and trusted.p  pUnfortunately, one, openmap, loads binary files shape and layer files.  I cannot sign these files AFAIK, because they arent jars, dont have manifests, etc.p  pSince the jar loads binary files, I get the mixed code warning when running.  The only thing Ive figured out to avoid this is to mark EVERY .jar as TrustedLibrary true.  Changing the manifest on all the .jars means that all the .jars have to be resigned, which is a political problem.p  pI know the dialog can be disabled in the java control panel.  Im looking for another workaround.  Naively, I would like to be able to somehow mark openmap or my jar that uses it to be trusted or whatever it takes to load those files without the warning.  I tried making openmap a trustedlibrary, that doesnt eliminate the error.  If I try making my jar that uses openmap a trusted library, then I run into issues because my jar depends on yet other jars and the class definitions in my jar cant be loaded because those dependent classes are in another classloader.p  pEditbr This appears to trigger the dialog Clicked Yes, block potentially unsafe to get this logging statementp  blockquote   psecurity resource name   httplocalhost8080mapspoliticalWorldvmappoliticalworldvmapareathin.shp   in a hrefhttplocalhost8080appclientlib relnofollowhttplocalhost8080appclientliba    java.lang.SecurityException trusted loader attempted to load   sandboxed resource from a hrefhttplocalhost8080appclientlib relnofollowhttplocalhost8080appclientlibap blockquote

Negative 35311 pAs a C developer, I recently decided to take a crack at writing some C programs, mainly because I found an interesting C API I wanted to play around with. I wrote a very simple program a few days ago, compiled it on the x64 target platform, ran it, and everything was just peachy.p  pHowever, yesterday I changed some of the code, tried to compile it, but then the linker started to complainp  pemLNK1158 cannot run cvtres.exeemp  pAs I am quite new to developing C programs, I thought I must had made some beginners mistake. However, after checking all configuration, searching google for several hours, and trying several fixes, Im starting to think this problem might be caused by something more delegate, and the point is I cannot seem to resolve the issue at all, so I was hoping to get some good feedback here.p  pFirst of all, let me list my configurationp  ul liI am running Windows 7 x64 and am using VS2010 Premium.li liI have created a standard and empty Win32 Console application with only a single .cppfile inside it that contains the main function. Its not a Hello World program, but not far off.li liSince I have an x64 platform, Im also using an x64 targetplatform configuration. I created this configuration without copying any settings from the Win32 configuration.li liIn Project Properties  VC Directories, I left all directories at their defaults though I did change them a few times to attempt to resolve the issue, without success, so I went back to the defaults.li ul  pThis last point seems to be crucial, since the VC Directory settings determine which compiler and linker are used. At this point, the crosscompiler residing in the strongVCInstallDirbinx86amd64strongdirectory is used. Furthermore, all other directories seem to point at x64 versions of all libraries and so on.p  pWhen you google this problem, you will find out that the linker used link.exe wants to execute cvtres.exe, which it cannot find. This problem seems to occur when cvtres.exe is neither in the same directory as the linker, nor in a directory that is resolved using the PATHvariable.p  pSo I verified this and there is indeed no version of cvtres.exe in strongVCInstallDirbinx86amd64strong though there are versions of it in the basedirectory strongVCInstallDirbinstrong and in the pure strongVCInstallDirbinamd64strong directory, nor does the PATHvariable contain any listing of a directory that contains a version of cvtres.exe.p  pstrong Attempt 01  Fix the problem at hand strongp  pAs a result, you might conclude that the error is, in fact, a legal failure and I should fix this by either copying a version of cvtres.exe directly in the strongVCInstallDirbinx86amd64strong directory, or edit the PATHvariable as such that it points to usable version of it.p  pUnfortunately, none of this works.p  pWhen I copy cvtres.exe from strongVCInstallDirbinstrong or strongVCInstallDirbinamd64strong to strongVCInstallDirbinx86amd64strong and compile, I either get the same message now referring to the exact location cannot run strongVCInstallDirbinx86amd64cvtres.exestrong, though it is there or the linker exits with some unknown errorcode probably because the version of strongVCInstallDirbinamd64strong is native x64 unlike the x86 crosscompiler which I have found out to be running in WoW64 mode.p  pThe problem with attempting to edit the PATHvariable such that the linker can find a version cvtres.exe also fails because I dont know with path to refer to it seems there are many more versions of cvtres.exe kept in various locations, also in the .NET 4.0 SDK directory for example.p  pstrong Attempt 02  Circumvent the problem by trying a different approach strongp  pAnother path that I have taken is to try to use the compiler and linker in the strongVCInstallDirbinamd64strong instead of the crosscompiler. After all, I am running a 64bit machine so I shouldnt need to use the crosscompiler, though Microsoft seems to choose this one by default, regardless of your local configurationOS.p  pSo I changed the VC Directory to point to this location and indeed the problem no longer occurs, but now I got a trackerproblem running the CL.exe insteadp  pemTRK0002 [CL.exe] [TempFile].rsp Invalid handle.emp  pWhen I look for this tempfile I cannot find it, but Im not sure whether it is immediately deleted after compilation completed or it was never present at all. Unfortunately, googling this issue is a dead end also, and a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails505682x64ccprojectscannotcompileMS Visual Studio 2010 team even recognise this issue but have put it on Wont Fixa. In short, compiling natively 64bit seems to be a known, general problem with VS2010, so I decided to go back to square one on this one, especially since other people having this problem always say well you can fix this problem by just using the crosscompiler instead of the native x64 compiler.p  pOK, so now I find myself running out of options... And the crazy thing is that it all worked fine just a few days ago and Im pretty sure I did not change or install anything regarding this project, nor updated Visual Studio or the .NET Framework somehow. I even checked the Windows Updated but cant find any related updates for the last few days.p  pThe only thing I could do, really as a last resort, is to downgrade the whole thing to 32bit and download the 32bit version of the API, but Id really want to avoid this one because it seems to me I should be able to compile and run 64bit applications on my 64bit laptopOS.p  pSo please, any suggestionsp  pemUpdateem According to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa448630.aspxthis instruction from MSa, the PATHvariable for the linker has to point at the basedirectory of the VC install. That is the strongVCInstallDirbinstrong I have been talking about. I have tried this, but does not solve the issue. I am wondering what is happening in the background when a VS Build is fired that I dont seem to know of...p  pHans Passant Thnx for the tip Process Monitor shows me that link.exe is trying to find cvtres.exe on one of following locationsp  ul liVCInstallDirbinx86amd64li liSourceFileDirli liCWindowsSystem32NVli ul  pNeedless to say, cvtres.exe exists in none of these directories. Its rather strange that emonlyem those locations are searched. I would at least expect that strongVCInstallDirbinstrong was searched, since this directory is explicitly listed in both the VC Directories and in the PATHvariable which I editted manually for this purpose. I guess this comes down to findout out why this behaviour is as it is....p  pemUpdate2em Just to put out some extra info, I decided to copy cvtres.exe from the strongVCInstallDirbinstrong to the strongVCInstallDirbinx86amd64strong directory, based on my findings using ProcMon, just to see what was happening then. First of all, as before, Visual Studio tells me the followingp  pemCProgram Files x86MSBuildMicrosoft.Cppv4.0Platformsx64Microsoft.Cpp.x64.Targets389,5 error MSB6006 link.exe exited with code 1073741515.em The line here just refers to a settings that checks which nonzero exitcodes are acceptable  the actual errorcode was returned by link.exe.p  pHowever, in the output Window of ProcMon I can see that cvtres.exe is found and is performing a large amount of work  to completion as it seems, but I am not quite sure about that. Anyway, the error still prevents me from executing the created executable, since it complains a certain referenced library was not found. This is probably due to the fact that the linker did not finish correctly, so in short, it does not resolve my issue here.p  pemUpdate3em Another interesting thing I tried was to just create a new, plain Win32 project with all MS defaults and I didnt even touch the code that is generated for me a main function returning immediately, just to see at least a single program compile. Suprisingly, I now get the same error as above link.exe exited with code 1073741515, so now I really start to think somethings really wrong with my installation here.p  pSo then I tried to de and reinstall the VC parts of Visual Studio, but to no avail... At this point a full install of Visual Studio is no option since Im also still in the middle of developing C projects and I have tons of other addins installed that just take too much of my time at the moment to reinstall and reconfigure. I might try this in the weekend if nothing has worked out until then.p  pInstead, I did some research on the error code and I think it has something to do with the fact that link.exe cannot find or access a dependency it requires. I already turned off my VirusScanner just to be safe doesnt  help, so now Im downloading the latest Windows SDK 7.1 to see if that does anything. If that doesnt help, Im guess it is either a terrible bug, or my installation is really screwed up somewhere and I might have to reinstall VS and all its stuff...p  pThanks for the suggestions anywayp

The Default.png of the app is of the login screen background, so it might be either that or a backgroundingtime screenshot of the actual login screen I havent tested replacing Default.png yet to tell the difference.p  pWhy is this As far as I can tell, backgrounding the app should just take a screenshot of the view that is visible on the screen when, say, hitting the home button, and restore that prior to restoring the actual view functionality when coming back to the foreground. In this case that would be one of the tabs of the tab bar controller. Is the modal segue between the login screen and the tab bar controller the culprit here, or something elsep  pIve always felt that the cross dissolve modal segue from the login screen to the first useful screen is a bit dirty, since IMHO a modal segue seems to imply that what your segueing to is something youll later dismiss to get back to the from screen. What Im doing now is just leaving the target of the modal segue visible indefinitely. If that is the problem here, Id love it if someone would suggest a better method of displaying, transitioning away from and jettisoning the login screen.p

Negative 35311 pi was thinking of implementing features of turning on and off certain things on my website like registering and logging of. I could include a file with variables like sop  precodeltphp upload  1 register  1 gt codepre  pAnd then in suppose my register.php file i could do a check like sop  precodeifregister  1 Show form  else  echo Registration is disabled  codepre  pi was wondering if this would be a security issue as i read somewhere that stuff can be suffixed the url to bring the same effect Like sop  precoderegister.phpregister1 codepre  pBut that does not work if register globals are turned off, is this much of a security issuep

Negative 35311 pIve spent the last few days messing around with Selenium, Tor, and Firefox as a combination for multiple tasks. Ive managed to write a simple script in Python that takes control of Firefox through Selenium, while Firefox is connected to Tor for privacy.p  pNow, Im looking for a way to save resources, so I thought of running Firefox in headless mode, which I thought was a common feature but it doesnt seem to be that. Im looking for a method to do just that. The reason for it being Firefox and not some terminal based browser is because of the extension TorButton that Im using within Firefox. It has javascript injections built in to it that help with privacy. p  pIf anyone has done this before which Im sure many have, some tips would be greatly appreciated, thank you p

Negative 35311 pWe are using the Love2d Lua game engine that exposes a graphics api to Lua.  We are trying to serialize a giant hash table that contains all the save game data for the game world.

This works well for pure Lua functions, but when we try to serialize and then load back in a function which calls a wrapped C function such as one in the Love2d api, loadstring returns nil.p  pConsider the following simple program that draws hello, world to the screen via Love2ds graphics enginep  precodefunction love.load     draw  function         love.graphics.printhello, world, 10, 10     end end function love.draw     draw end codepre  pWe would like to be able to do thisp  precodefunction love.load     drawbeforeserialize  function         love.graphics.printhello, world, 10, 10     end      out  io.openserialized.lua, wb     outwritedraw  load[[ .. string.dumpdrawbeforeserialize .. ]]     outclose      require serialized end function love.draw     draw end codepre  pDoing this writes to a Lua file on disk that contains a mix of noncompiled Lua and Lua bytecode, which looks something like thisp  precodedraw  load[[[LJA              main.lua2BBDEBB4AAgtBAGAQhello, world         printAAAB]] codepre  pThis method works fine with Lua functions that do not call C modules.

We thought that perhaps the culprit was not writing out the data with the binary write mode flag set codewbcode, but since we are on Linux this flag has no effect.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 35311 pIm planning a website which will use huge schematics, that is, raster images that are not photos. If they were photos and I were interested on displaying them as so, I would use  either a hrefhttpwww.zoomify.comhtml5.htm relnofollowzoomifya, a hrefhttpiipimage.sourceforge.netdemo relnofollowIIPImagea or a hrefhttpwww.dimin.netsoftwarepanojs relnofollowPanoJSa.

But I came to a stumbling blockp  pWhat kind of tiles leaflet expects Where is information about that Would the map projection, or other geospecific aspects that Im not aware of, be a problemp  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 35311 pI have an issue with firefox, after taking a particular web app and closing the browser. While i take the browser again on exit, it shows firefox already running alert message. Unless i kill the process, the browser cant be opened again. In the web app we are doing a background process via AJAX for fetching certain contents. Is it because that these processes still run on background which prevents the browser from opening again. Can any one suggest something in killing the background process on browser exit or a specific reason for this and a probable solution in this regard.p

Negative 35311 pIm wondering how to enforce a unique constraint for the names of sibling nodes when using a a hrefhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20110214movingsubtreesinclosuretable relnofollowclosure tablea in MySQL to model a hierarchy.p  pThis is my schemap  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodecreate table spaces    id int not null,    name varchar50 not null,   parent int not null,   primary key id,   foreign key parent references spacesid,   unique key name, parent   create table spacepaths    ancestor int not null,   descendant int not null,   depth int not null,   primary key ancestor, descendant,   foreign key ancestor references spacesid,   foreign key descendant references spacesid  codepre  pWith this schema Im using a unique constraint on the codespacescode table to verify that no sibling has the same name.p  pThe downside of this approach is that it denormalizes the hierarchy metadata encapsulated in the codespacepathscode table. The implication is that I would need to manually manage the consistency of codeparentcode field in the codespacescode table with the paths in the codespacepathscode table.p  pIs there a way I could redesign the schema to have the database enforce a unique name constraint across siblings without having to denormalize   p

Negative 35311 pI am having a problem with a system I am building. I have successfully implemented a SP initiated SSO system. However, the issue arises when considering that this system has multiple unique and fully segregated Service Providers that must be capable of interacting and exchanging data. When one SP SP1 needs to communicate to another SP SP2, they need to be able to seamlessly transition while remaining secure. Thus, I assume they need to be able to assert or share SAML data. p  pFor instance, a user tries to access the system via SP1 and is redirected to the IdP. The user authenticates against the IdP which will then assert via http post back to SP1. The user now performs a series of tasks on SP1 which eventually require data transmission or a browser redirect to SP2. SP2 is unaware that SP1 had successfully authenticated the user and received a SAML response from the IdP. This is where my problem arises. I need to implement a mechanism that will allow SP2 to become aware of the users status on SP1. More generally, I need to allow any service provider in a set of service providers to make assertions to one another about the status of a user. However, I cannot find documentation on the official way to accomplish this task. p  pI have thought of multiple solutions to the problem but I doubt that any of them are official in the least.  One would be persisting a list of SAML assertions on the IdP which can be referenced by guid. Then passing a link from SP1 to SP2 which would reference a controller action and guid that would allow the IdP to reassert data to SP2. This seems slow and convoluted.  Two would be persisting the SAML response somehow after the response is received on SP1 and somehow passing the data to SP2 whenever a user is redirected. p  pI may be overthinking and over complicating this process. I may need to move to an IdP initiated SSO based solution. I may be over looking something in the documentation. p  pIf anyone could shed any light on this topic, it would be appreciated. I will be glad to provide any additional information about the subject. p

Negative 35311 pIm using g 4.4 to compile a shared library on linux.

Since much of the standard library is headeronly and gnus header files are generally full of version ifdefs, I would think that there may be a way to use a more recent version of at least the header files in libstdc.

Negative 35311 pIm using a hrefhttpcode.google.compnaga relnofollownagaa to do some asynchronous socket programming.p  pHowever I need to be able to attach arbitrary data to the Socket objects.p  pFor instance I have code like sop  precodeservice  new NIOService  Server is JSONObject NIOSocket socket  service.openSocketServer.getStringip, Server.getIntport  Add mydata to socket socket.listenobserver  See class below System.out.printlnsocket.mydata get new data   public static class Observer extends SocketObserverAdapter           Called when Socket makes connection         Override         public void connectionOpenedNIOSocket socket              System.out.printlnsocket.mydata  get data             socket.mydata  yay set data           codepre  pThe problem I have is that I need to both get and set data on a socket object in the codeObserver.connectionOpenedcode callback, and be able to access it later.p  pI realize that there probably isnt a way to just add data to the object, but whats the best way to associate data with the object so that I can pass it around and still access and modify the datap  pI can always recompile the class code to add the variables to the class, but that seems very hackish, which I try to stay away from.p  pNote Im fairly new to Java programming, but not to programming in general.p

A folder entry should start with a 0x2E but there is no such value. So how to find out whether a given entry is a file or folder 2. As you can see each entry in the root directory occupies 64 bytes instead of 32 bytes. There seems to be 2 32byte entries for each file and folder. For example, folder a has entries at 0x32800 and 0x32820 totally 64bytes. 3. What does the value 0x41 denote in this context The value 0x41 appears at 0x32800, 0x32820, 0x32840, 0x32880. The values at 0x32860 and 0x328A0 are different from 0x41. 4. The offset 0x1A from address 0x32800 0x32800  0x1a  0x3281a has value 0, offset 0x1A from address 0x32820 0x32820  0x1a  0x3283a has value 3.

Negative 35311 pSo I am currently working on learning slick. I was doing fine until I ran into a problem. I have been trying to find a answer for a good hour and could not. So I decided to post it on here.p  pMy Problem I have player on a 800 X 800 Grid. I am trying to make the player move to a certain point on the grid in a straight line. Now I can make him move on the X then turn and move on the Y, But I want to make him get there as fast as possible. So I figured if I could make a right triangle from the following points Player pos, Target Pos, and the X,Y intercept see my image bellow. p  precodeMy code Adj  int TargetXx  Get The size of the Adjacent leg. Opp    int TargetYy  Get the size of the Opposite leg. OppAdj  OppAdj          Inverse tan is OppositeAdjacent TargetAngle   Math.absMath.atanOppAdj100  Keep the angle positive, and use inverse tan to get the missing angle. codepre  pNow what I thought this would do, is solve for the missing angle so I could rotate the player by that amount so the player can move in a straight line and hit the objective.p  pWhat this ends up doing though is is giving me a target angle of 73 degrees and a the Variable OppAdj ends up being 1.0.p  pWhat is wrong with my codep  pAny help is appreciatedp  pThanks, Kylep

Negative 35311 pI dont know how to formulate what the algorithm I need does in fewer words it is highly possible that such question is already answered here, but I dont know how to search for it.p  pWhat I need is the following.br Im writing kind of 2D graph plotting program. Obviously, drawing only main coordinate lines is not very good, since the graph can be located far from the origin, and the user will not have any reference for its size if only main lines are drawn.br I decided to draw reference lines, that is, horizontal and vertical lines which appear periodically with constant interval, corresponding to e.g. whole numbers. However, using constant intervals does not work so great because of possibility of scaling, that is, if user zooms in to see, for example, internals of unit square, he will again see nearly empty box without any reference to sizes.p  pSo, I need to somehow rescale the interval which I use to draw the reference lines. In other words, I need a function of type like codedouble gt doublecode which accepts current scale coefficient the one I use specifies how many pixels are in one unit of length or a value of some function applied to it e.g. maximum number of unit lengths which can fit inside the screen along some axis and returns a value of step in pixels on in logical units, does not matter, that is, the length of the interval between reference lines.p  pI believe that the set of values of such function would be countably infinite, that is, this function would map intervals of scale coefficient value to fixed values of the step. I can give rough description of the algorithm, or, more correctly, the mapping I need. It looks similarly to this input value is the maximum number of units inside the screenp  ul li...li li[5..9]  0.25li li[9..15]  0.5li li[15..30]  1li li...li ul  pThe values here are purely empirical and used only for illustration.p  pHowever, I dont know how to extrapolate this set of mappings to wider range of scale coefficient values, let alone how to express such dependency analytically. Yet Im sure that this is possible because I saw such thing in many graphing programs.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9009265algorithmforselfscalingrulerinplotterguicomponentthisa question which looks very close to what I need, but I couldnt manage to adapt the answer to it to my task since it mentions label width and I dont have any labels.p

The problem arises when trying to test the class in Eclipse using an OpenJPA implementation I have strongnotstrong tried others so not sure if it might work with them. p  pMy test case is simple enough in that it creates an EntityManagerFactory which automatically finds the persistence.xml on my classpath and then it tries to create an EntityManager from the factory. This is when I get hit with a very ambiguous PersistenceException null error.p  pThe Entity with the problem is the following LogError class. I have stripped it down to the bare minimum and it still throws an error.p  precodeEntity Tablename  TLOGERROR public class LogError   Id GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY private Long ID  private String ERROR  protected LogError   public String getErrorName throws FieldNullException      if this.ERROR  null         throw new FieldNullExceptionerror was null, null     return this.ERROR   public setErrorSystemError error      this.ERROR  error.getClass.getCanonicalName     codepre  pp  pI have discovered that the problem seems to lie with throwing an exception within the getErrorName method. You see, if I was to comment out the first two lines of the method like sop  precodepublic String getErrorName throws FieldNullException      if this.ERROR  null       throw new FieldNullExceptioncaughtException was null, null     return this.ERROR  codepre  pthen the error disappears. Just to clarify, the FieldNullException is my own custom made exception, however it does not make a difference as I have tried with standard java exceptions such as NullPointerException and the error is the same.p  pstrongSo my question is, is it illegal to throw exceptions with methods of an Entity classstrongp  pstrongAnd also why do I get an errorstrongp  pHere is my tester methodp  precodeTest

sun.instrument.InstrumentationImpl.retransformClassesInstrumentationImpl.java144 ... 39 more codepre  pstrongWhy I want to throw the exception anywaystrongp  pFor me, throwing a FieldNullException on each getter method that represents a column that NULL is allowed, forces the user of these getter methods to take appropriate action when needing the values of these getters.p  pSo for examplep  precode At some point this object is created LogError logError  new LogError logError.setErrornew SystemError   Some point later, someone wants to retreive the error name from this object   and pull only the first 10 letters for display try      return logError.getErrorName.substring0,10  Safely perform substring  catch FieldNullExcepion      return   codepre  pIf my getter did not have a throws FieldNullException then it potentially allows a user of the getter to perform an action on a null objectp  precode If getErrorName returns null, then this will throw NullPointerException return logError.getErrorName.substring0,10  codepre  pTo avoid this the user can obviously check if the returned value from the getter is null before performing anything else emand there is nothing wrong with thatem. The benefit of my way, is strongsimplystrong to say emhey, this field may contain null so take appropriate actionem.p  pAnd an Entity can have many fields, so attaching throws NullFieldException on the getters that allow null, will strongconvenientlystrong signal to the caller which exact fields may be null and thus take alternative action on them. Thus not having to try and remember which may be null or pulling up your entity to check for your NotNull annotations etc. p  pemWrite once and let it remind youem p  pI do not use these methods for validation and I dont see how it is business logic. It is completely to do with the characteristic of the underlying database field.p

Ive been working with a hrefhttpwww.computerperformance.co.ukpowershellpowershellregex.htmPowerShellRegexReplaceText relnofollow titlethis tutorialthis tutoriala, but I cant seem to replace the space s with an underscore when that space is between an open and closed square bracket.p  pHeres an example of how Id like to transform the sqlp  pConvertp  precodeselect  from [Existing product] where [Existing product].[Desc value]  26 codepre  pTop  precodeselect  from [Existingproduct] where [Existingproduct].[Descvalue]  26 codepre  pWhen I run this script in powershell ISEp  precodeExample of PowerShell Regex Replace newline    strText  select  from [Existing product] where [Existing product].[Desc value]  26 Pattern  lt[slts] New   newline SourceText  strText newline strReplace  [regex]replacestrText, pattern, New We will now replace Pattern with New   newline strReplace codepre  pI get this resultp  precodePS Cgt CREGEX.ps1  SourceText  select  from [Existing product] where [Existing product].[Description value]  26   We will now replace lt[slts] with     select  from [Existing product] where [Existing product].[Description value]  26 codepre  pWhere I hope to see the string with spaces replaced with underscores, above.p  pMy regex is currently codelt[slts]code but apparently it only selects spaces where the square bracket is right next to it.  What am I missing from the regex abovep  pPlease let me know if you have any questions and thanks for the helpp

Negative 35311 pI want to bin the values of polygons to a fine regular grid. For instance, I have the following coordinatesp  precodedata  2.353 datalats  np.array[57.81000137,  58.15999985,  58.13000107,  57.77999878] datalons  np.array[148.67999268,  148.69999695,  148.47999573,  148.92999268] codepre  pMy regular grid looks like thisp  precodedelta  0.25 gridlons  np.arange180, 180, delta gridlats  np.arange90, 90, delta llx, lly  np.meshgrid gridlons, gridlats  rows  lly.shape[0] cols  llx.shape[1] grid  np.zerosrows,cols codepre  pNow I can find the grid pixel that corresponds to the center of my polygon very easilyp  precodecenterx, centery  np.meandatalons, np.meandatalats row  intnp.floor centerydelta   grid.shape[0]2 col  intnp.floor centerxdelta   grid.shape[1]2 grid[row,col]  data codepre  pHowever, there are probably a couple of grid pixels that still intersect with the polygon. Hence, I would like to generate a bunch of coordinates inside my polygon datalons, datalats and find their corresponding grid pixel as before. Do you a suggestion to generate the coordinates randomly or systematically I failed, but am still trying.p  pNote One data set contains around 80000 polygons so it has to be really fast a couple of seconds. That is also why I chose this approach, because it does not account the area of overlap... like my earlier question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13934959databinningirregularpolygonstoregularmeshData binning irregular polygons to regular mesha which is VERY slowp
Negative 35311 pI have searched and searched and cant find an answer. I am trying to open a Pyro connection between two unix devices. I can connect 4 times to the device using a Pyro4 Proxy with an identical URI string. On the fifth connection, the instance hangs on my get data function call. It goes through the core.py pyro package and ends up waiting to get the data. Very occasionally, one of these open connections that was created after the fourth one will throw a ConnectionClosedError exception that looks like thisp  precode ConnectionClosedErrorreceiving connection lost strx  ConnectionClosedError receiving connection lost [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer codepre  pIf I havent been clear, the following is what causes this issue Open 4 connections on different SSH sessions to the device and run repeated tests which setup a pyro proxy. These work just fine and complete without error Open more connections, all hanging on my call to get data. They hang for at least 5 minutes, and some will infrequently raise the above exception. Not all of them will do this. Once 1 of the 4 running tests finishes, the 5th test that was hanging will pick up and finish just fine. The others will follow, but never any more than 4 at a time.p  pLastly, the following code in socketutil.py is where the exception is actually happeningp  precodedef receiveDatasock, size     Retrieve a given number of bytes from a socket.     It is expected the socket is able to supply that number of bytes.     If it isnt, an exception is raised you will not get a zero length result     or a result that is smaller than what you asked for. The partial data that     has been received however is stored in the partialData attribute of     the exception object.     try         retrydelay0.0         msglen0         chunks[]         if hasattrsocket, MSGWAITALL              waitall is very convenient and if a socket error occurs,              we can assume the receive has failed. No need for a loop,              unless it is a retryable error.              Some systems have an erratic MSGWAITALL and sometimes still return              less bytes than asked. In that case, we drop down into the normal              receive loop to finish the task.            while True             try                 datasock.recvsize, socket.MSGWAITALL                 if lendatasize                     return data                  less data than asked, drop down into normal receive loop to finish                 msglenlendata                 chunks[data]                 break             except socket.timeout                 raise TimeoutErrorreceiving timeout             except socket.error                 xsys.excinfo[1]                 errgetattrx, errno, x.args[0]                 if err not in ERRNORETRIES                     HERE                     raise ConnectionClosedErrorreceiving connection lost strx                 time.sleep0.00001retrydelay   a slight delay to wait before retrying                 retrydelaynextRetrydelayretrydelay codepre  pWould really appreciate some direction here.

Negative 35311 pIve just been doing some experimenting recently with functional reactive programming and what it is, and when i was trying to implement something like it in c, i turned to the lambda for some help.

Then that Reactive would be assigned to cheh. When the value mmeh had 4 added to it, and cheh was updated, its affector was called with the new value of 14 and that is what is printed to the screen, exactly as id intended.p  pBut then i got to thinking, what if one of those Reactives that takes part in chehs affecter goes out of scope. The program should error out, if not handled correctly. So i did this,p  precodeReactiveltintgt cheh  0 Reactiveltintgt meh  3       Reactiveltintgt peh  7     cheh  meh  peh     peh  peh  4   cheh.Update stdcout ltlt cheh.Get codepre  pAt the point when update is called, the Reactive peh that took place in his affecter has gone out of scope and no longer exists. However, this program and chehs affecter execute successfully and it prints out 14 just as before. I know that the values in the lambda were passed in by the reference capture, so how can the affecter function still access the reference to peh Does an object or integral type passed into a lambda by reference force them to persist as long as the lambda exists Something smells fishy...p

The simplest solution just create method codedoWork2code with replacing codehelpcode to codehelp2code.p  pIt is very bad approach, because every change in codedoWorkcode must be replicated in codedoWork2code either.

There is no problem with installation of codecommonscode project mvn clean install. Changed source file of codeAbstractCellTable.javacode appears in generated jar file. But when Im compiling dependant projects I get compile errors. I dont have stacktrace now, but the reason of this problem lies in using by GWT compiler original version of codeAbstractCellTable classcode. Errors show that codecommons.jarcode has compile errors sic even if was installed properly earlier.p  pIve already tried to change ordering of dependencies in codepom.xmlcode, but it doesnt work. Im thinking about installing own version of codegwtuser.jarcode in my repo, but it wont be easy, as GWT project dont rely on Maven.p  pIs there any better solution to replace original GWT classesp

To me, it looks like gcc stores a pointer to argc and argv[0] at [rbp4] and [rbp16], then loads the [rbp16] into rax as a basepoint pointer to argv[0], and adds 8,16,24,... to make rax point to argv[1,2,3,...], and then loads that address into the appropriate register to pass to printf.p  pWith that interpretation, I was able to understand enough about how the command line arguments are passed to main to be able to fix my GAS code to thisp  precode.intelsyntax noprefix .globl  main  .data fmt    .asciz  d,s,s,s,s,sn  .text main     push    rbp     mov     rbp, rsp      mov     rdx, QWORD PTR [rsi]     mov     rcx, QWORD PTR [rsi8]     mov     r8, QWORD PTR [rsi16]     mov     r9, QWORD PTR [rsi24]     push    [rsi32]     mov     rsi, rdi     mov     rdi, offset fmt     xor     rax, rax     call    printf  return     mov     rsp, rbp     pop     rbp     xor     rax, rax     ret codepre  pThis produces the same output as the test.c does, as well as the gccgenerated test.s. So my question is this.... Is there anything wrong with the way I did it And if not, why would gcc generate such a complicated way to do something that is this simple Maybe its just the way the compiler interprets the use of arraysp  pI suppose my way is technically correct since it produces the same output, but I want to make sure it is an acceptable way to do it.p

Negative 35311 pstrongIntrostrongp  pIm developing a wordpress website where I have a form. The validation of that form is made using jQuery Inline Form Validation Engine 2.2.p  pI have some radio buttons that have two options YesNo, followed by a required field that only appears if someone chose No, to explain why. Something like the following examplep  blockquote   p1  Is John Matrix cooler than John Rambop      prarr Yesp      pnbspnbspnbspnbsp Nop      pnbspp      p2  Is Commando the best movie everp      pnbspnbspnbspnbspYesp      prarr Nop      pWhy not strongememememememememememememememememememememstrong  requiredp blockquote  pSo, if someone would say No, the Why not field appearsp  precodeif nocommandofield.ischecked      whynotfield.show  else      whynotfield.hide  codepre  pnbspp  pstrongProblemstrongp  pMy problem is that the Why not field is required, even if someone selects the Yes option like its supposed to. I would like to make this field required only if the previous answer is No.p  pstrongQuest to solve problemstrongp  pWhile exploring the code Im not a backend specialist I realized that the Inline Form Validation Engine adds a class to the required fields, called validate[required]. I tried deleting that class using jQuery, but the validation still occurs.p  precodevar validate validate  whynotfield.attrclass validate  validate.replacevalidate[required],notvalidated whynotfield.attrclass,validate  if  nocommandofield.ischecked      validate  validate.replacenotvalidated,validate[required]     whynotfield.attrclass,validate  else      validate  validate.replacevalidate[required],notvalidated     whynotfield.attrclass,validate  codepre  pThe class swap is working perfectly, but somehow the validation is still occurring. Although this solution worked for me on previous forms only on the wordpress backoffice, Im not sure it is the right path to solve this issue.p  pI would like someone to point me in the right direction so I can understand this problem better, in order to solve it. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 35311 pI downloaded a website template to use for a small project but for some reason the sidebar used for navigation gets cut short when the content DIV isnt at least the height of the page. Ive been tinkering with the CSS and inspecting it through Firefox Web Developer but aside from having the minheight set to something very large, I am not sure how to fix this issue.p  pAny suggestions as to what to look at in the CSS would be greatly appreciated.p  pa hrefhttpbrutalservers.comdpindex.html relnofollowhttpbrutalservers.comdpindex.htmlap  pHTMLp  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtml

Negative 35311 pSo I have a link to a video online e.g. somewebsite.commyVideo.mkv and I want to download that video on the server through a servlet. The video file has CDN enabled, so basically any public user can just put the link into the browser and it will start playing. This is the code I have so far.p  precodedownloadFileURL myURL    InputStream input  myURL.openStream    File video  new File pathtofile  myURL.getFile    FileOutputStream output  new FileOutputStreamoutput     byte[] buffer  new byte[1024]    int read      Write full range.    while read  input.readbuffer gt 0      output.writebuffer, 0, read         output.close    input.close  codepre  pIf I do that, it would download the entire video file from the URL and the video playback fine. However, if I want to specify a specific byte range on the video downloadFileURL myURL, long startByte, long endByte, the video doesnt playback. I used the function input.skip to skip forward to the startByte but I suspect it skips over some important header of the mkv format. Thats why the player cant recognize it. Does anyone know how to do this in javap

Negative 35311 pIm building a PHP app to prefill third party PDF account forms with client data, and am getting stuck on the database design. p  pThe current form has about 70 fields, which seems like far too many to set up as individual columns, especially as some ie companytrust information are not relevant depending on the type of account the client requires.p  pIve tried to normalize but it seems like there would be a lot of joins, and also require several sub queries for things like multiple addresses.p  pIt also means a ton of extra queries to check if rows exist or not when updating to decide if the script needs to do an INSERT, a DELETE or an UPDATE, whereas if it was all in one row, it would basically just be an UPDATE each time.p  pNot sure if this helps but here is a list of most of the fieldsp  blockquote   pid, accounttype, accountphone, accountemail, accountdesignation, accountadviser, accountsource, accountcomplete,    accountresidentialunitnumber, accountresidentialstreetnumber, accountresidentialstreetname, accountresidentialstreettype, accountresidentialsuburb, accountresidentialstate, accountresidentialpostcode,    accountpostalunitnumber, accountpostalstreetnumber, accountpostalstreetname, accountpostalstreettype, accountpostalsuburb, accountpostalstate, accountpostalpostcode,    individual1title, individual1firstname, individual1middlename, individual1lastname, individual1dob, individual1occupation, individual1email, individual1phone,    individual1unitnumber, individual1streetnumber, individual1streetname, individual1streettype, individual1suburb, individual1state, individual1postcode,    individual2title, individual2firstname, individual2middlename, individual2lastname, individual2dob, individual2occupation, individual2email, individual2phone,    individual2unitnumber, individual2streetnumber, individual2streetname, individual2streettype, individual2suburb, individual2state, individual2postcode,    companyname, companydate,    companyunitnumber, companystreetnumber, companystreetname, companystreettype, companysuburb, companystate, companypostcode,    trustname, trustdate,    settlementbank, settlementaccount, settlementbsbp blockquote  pThe most this will need to handle is around 200,000 applications, and once the data is in the database, it wont change very often, if at all  not sure if that is relevantp  pSo really just wanted to figure out the smartest way to do design this, even if its just a name or topic to research further.p

Negative 35311 pIve been using Neatbean 7.3.1 to work on my java file XYZ.java, it was running OK, then I made some change, and compiled the project without problem, but when I tried to run XYZ.java, Neatbean 7.3.1 says  p  precodeError Could not find or load main class XYZ Java Result 1 codepre  pI tried a few times, same error. So I opened Netbeans 7.3 and compiled the project then run XYZ.java, it worked fine. Then I went back to Neatbean 7.3.1 and ran XYZ.java again [without recompiling], it worked fine, but after compiling on Neatbean 7.3.1, it will generate the same error when I run it on both Neatbean 7.3.1 and Neatbean 7.3p  pIve closed and reopened Neatbean 7.3.1 a few times, same result.

Negative 35311 pDatabase Designp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC0xDT.jpg altenter image description herep  pThis is my simple database design, what would I like to knowis which solution is better among the two. Solution 1 have each table for each dimension like 1366x768 dimension table and stores the path for specific dimension, and in Solution 2 there is a table which stores a generic pathwhich contains like sub folders and the dimensions table stores the dimensions and to retrieve the images concatenation can be used. So which you think is better among the two, like easy to implement, less complicated..something like that..p

Negative 35311 pHeres the deal I want to create a C console app.  When run, this app will look in a particular folder for dlls with classes that implement a particular interface, and then run a method on those dlls.p  pI havent done this before but from my reading that should be easy enough from an IoCNinject perspective.  I think you can do something with codekernel.Bindcode to load assemblies of a certain interface in a certain directory.  I thinkhope I can figure that part out if you know otherwise, please do tell.p  pBut here is my quandary.p  pHere is a visual to help firstp  precodeMainProgramFolder  MainProgram.exe  MainProgram.exe.config  LibraryFolder  Library1Folder Library1.dll Library1.dll.config  Library2Folder Library2.dll Library2.dll.config codepre  pThe dlls that implement this interface are technically stand alone apps  they are just libraries instead of exes or, rather, Id like them to be for IoC purposes.  Id like for them to be run in their own context, with their own app.configs.  So for example, MainProgram.exe would bind the ILibrary interface to classes inside Library1.dll and Library2.dll because they implement ILibrary.  But eminsideem Library1, it calls ConfigurationManager to get its settings.  When I call Class.Method for each of the bindings from MainProgram, how can I ensure they are referencing their own .configs and not MainProgram.exe.config  Also, fwiw, these additional libraries will likely not be a part of the assembly or even namespace of the main programs  were basically providing a drop folder for an application to kind of subscribe to the main programs execution.p  pIOW, I know you can attach an app.config to a class library but I wouldnt know how, after the bindings have been resolved from the IOC, to make those dlls see its own config rather than the main programs config.p  pAll thoughts appreciatedp  pThanks Tomp

Negative 35311 pI have built a simple Django photo app. Users can upload photos, follow other users and like photos. To handle relationships amongst the users following amp unfollowing I use a package called a hrefhttpsgithub.comcoleiferdjangorelationshipsdjangorelationshipsa by coleifer. Its a great package and very simple to use. p  pEverything works as it should. I currently have a working activity feed. p  pI filter the feed into two sections Following all the activities from the users that I follow amp You all the activities that happened to me. Ive posted two pictures below from my iOS app that uses my Django photo app as its backendp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfTWt6.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiNRRH.png altenter image description herep  pWhat I would like to do is add aggregation to the Following Feed. As you can see, user alexperri has liked  5 shots. I would like to aggregate all these items into one line. I dont need to add aggregation for the You feed since I would like to see each individual action happening to me. However for the Following feed, it makes sense to add aggregation. There are several applications that do aggregation very well. Fashionlista, Pinterest amp Instagram do this well. Here is an example from Instagram to show what I am trying to achievep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHufoo.png altenter image description herep  pIn the example above, you can see the following feed and that lovetoronto liked 5 photos. I started to play around with the Instagram following feed to see how it works. The Instagram following feed shows a maximum of 35 activity entries and each entry can have a maximum of 5 activities of that action type. lovetoronto liked 5 photos is one activity entry and it shows the latest 5 pictures that he liked. Since lovetoronto performed the latest action, he is at the top. p  pI would like to achieve the same setup. p  pHere is my current model setupp  pstrongmodels.pystrongp  precodefrom django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User  class Photographermodels.Model     user  models.OneToOneFieldUser, primarykeyTrue     likes  models.ManyToManyFieldPhoto, through  Likes,                                     relatedname  likedby, blank  True  class Photomodels.Model     photographer  models.ForeignKeyPhotographer, relatedname  shotowner     created  models.DateTimeFieldautonowaddTrue     url  models.CharFieldmaxlength128  class Likesmodels.Model     likedat  models.DateTimeFieldautonowaddTrue, blankTrue, nullTrue     photographer  models.ForeignKeyPhotographer, relatedname  likedby     photo  models.ForeignKeyPhoto, nullTrue  class Activitymodels.Model     actor  models.ForeignKeyPhotographer, relatedname  actor     receiver  models.ForeignKeyPhotographer, relatedname  receiver     action  models.CharFieldmaxlength12     post  models.ForeignKeyPhoto, nullTrue, blankTrue     time  models.DateTimeFieldautonowaddTrue codepre  pEvery time a Like object is created, I create an Activity object as well, the actor being the person who did the action, the receiver being the person who the action was done to, the action in this case a string, liked, post the photo and the time being the creation of the activity object.p  pI use djangotastypie to get and create Like amp Activity objects.p  pstrongapi.pystrongp  precodefrom tastypie.resources import ModelResource, ALL, ALLWITHRELATIONS from tastypie.authentication import BasicAuthentication from tastypie.authorization import DjangoAuthorization, Authorization from photoapp.photodb.models import  from tastypie.serializers import Serializer from relationships.utils import positivefilter from relationships.models import Relationship from relationships.models import RelationshipStatus  class LikeResourceModelResource     user  fields.ForeignKeyBasicUserResource, user, fullTrue     class Meta         queryset  Photographer.objects.all         allowedmethods  [put]         resourcename  like         fields  [user]         defaultformat  applicationjson         authorization  Authorization         authentication  BasicAuthentication         serializer  Serializerformats[json]         alwaysreturndata  True         includeresourceuri  False          def hydrateself, bundle             shot  Photo.objects.all.getid  bundle.data[photo id]             user  Photographer.objects.all.getuser  bundle.request.user             ifbundle.obj.likes.filterid  bundle.data[photo id].exists                 Likes.objects.all.filterphotographeruser.filterphotoshot.delete                  Activity.objects.filteractoruser  bundle.request.user,                     post  shot, action  liked.delete              else                 like  Likesphotographer  user, photoshot                 like.save                 userdoingtheliking  User.objects.get                     usernamebundle.request.user.username                 user  Photographer.objects.all.getuser  bundle.request.user                 usergettingliked  shot.photographer.user                 photographergettingliked  shot.photographer                 newActivity  Activity                 newActivity.actor  user                 newActivity.receiver  photographergettingliked                 newActivity.action  liked                 newActivity.post  shot                 newActivity.save      return bundle   class FollowingFeedModelResource     actor  fields.ForeignKeyBasicPhotographerResource, actor, fullTrue     receiver  fields.ForeignKeyBasicPhotographerResource, receiver, fullTrue     post  fields.ForeignKeyBasicPostResource, attribute  post, fullTrue, nullTrue     class Meta         queryset  Activity.objects.all         allowedmethods  [get]         resourcename  followingfeed         fields  [actor, receiver, action, post, id, time]         defaultformat  applicationjson         authorization  Authorization         authentication  BasicAuthentication         serializer  Serializerformats[json]         alwaysreturndata  True         includeresourceuri  False      def getobjectlistself, request         return superFollowingFeed, self.getobjectlistrequest             .filteractoruserin  request.user.relationships.following             .excludereceiveruser  request.user             .excludeactoruser  request.user.orderbytime  codepre  pHow can I modify the FollowingFeed resource in such a way that it will aggregate the activity objects I came across the a hrefhttpsgithub.comtschellenbachFeedlyFeedlya project.

Negative 35311 pI am considering a problem and cant come to a conclusive better of the two options. It comes down to deciding whether a complex data member ie, not a primitive should be a pointer or simply a value. Note, I have seen many questions about pointer vs reference for data members, but nothing regarding pointer vs value The biggest things Im weighing arep  ol liLifespan of the data member whether it lives the full life of its owner.li liIn the case when it emdoesem last the full lifespan, reducing memory fragmentation.li ol  pConsider the following codep  precodeclass PlayerStatistic      int mMaxValue     int mCurrentValue      And many other things that round out a player statistic   class PlayerStatisticManager      While in this case, it may be better to store stats as a list of some kind and     identify them by a StatId or something, for this example, Im declaring them      individually.     PlayerStatistic mpHealth     OR     PlayerStatistic mHealth       And many more statistics.  codepre  pIn the above example, every player always has health. Their health statistic is ALWAYS the lifespan of the StatisticManager, which in turn is ALWAYS the lifespan of the player. p  pIf this werent the case, I would prefer the pointer, so that codeNULLcode can be indicative that the object doesnt exist which might be better for a stat that not all players have. p  pHowever, because thats not the case, I emthinkem I would rather have it stored as value, in order to make fewer larger memory allocations, rather than many small memory allocations.p  pIs my thinking sound, or is there something Im not consideringp  pEdit  My choice of words pointer vs value was poor. What I meant was what one of the answers clarified p  blockquote   pWhat you are referring to here is weather its better to have the   codemHealthcode statically or dynamically allocatedp blockquote  pMoreover, in this case, I emknowem that healths lifespan is the players lifespan, so my question basically comes down to memory. Is it better memory management to statically allocate data members in the interest of having fewer allocations, and instead doing one big allocation when Player get newed.p

Negative 35311 pIm about to teach an introductory computer science course in C and Id like to demonstrate to students why they should check whether malloc returned a NULL. My plan was to use codeulimitcode to restrict the amount of available memory such that I could exercise different code paths with different limits. Our prescribed environment is CentOS 6.5.p  pMy first attempts to make this happened failed and the shell showed Killed. This led to me discovering the Linux OOM killer. I have since tried to figure out the magic set of incantations that will cause the results Im looking for.  Apparently I need to mess withp  ul licodeetcsysctl.confcodeli licodeulimit mcodeli licodeulimit vcodeli licodevm.overcommitmemorycode which apparently should be set to 2, according to an Oracle articleli ul  pThis far either I get Killed or a segmentation fault, neither of which is the expected outcome. The fact that Im getting Killed with vmovercommitmemory2 means that I definitely dont understand whats going on.p  pIf anyone can find a way to artificially and reliably create a constrained execution environment on CentOS so that students learn how to handle OOM and other kinds of errors, many course instructors will thank you.p

Negative 35311 pI dont know if this is counted as a bug, but I am sure that is definitely wrong. I am working with three projects two silverlight projects A and B, and a silverlight class library projet C. There are some common tasks that both A and B need to accomplish, so I put them into project C and both A and B reference to C. In project C a WCF servic is invoked. vs2012 creates for C a client config file to reference to WCF service. The key content of the config file is belowp  precodeltendpoint addresshttplocalhost15154StaffService.svc            binding... bindingConfiguration...            contract...           name... gt codepre  pPlease note that the address is absolute uri. At runtime the codes in C which invoke WCF service use in the fact the client config file of his invoinking application here named A and B. So I imitate what vs does for silverlight application and creat by hand in projects A and B client cofig file with relative uri like belows and delete the client config file in C.p  precodeltendpoint address..StaffService.svc            binding... bindingConfiguration...            contract...           name... gt codepre  pThis relative uri means that service client classes in C are going to locate config from the parent folder of where A and B as xap is downloaded. So far everything is going all right till I publish the web site which holds A and B.p  pI am very satified with the performance of my projects in developing enviornment and a damper hited me in front of quite some VIPs right after I deployed them. The program does nothing. The screen is just a white paper.p  pAfter a whole days digging, I found that the class libray C worked not. And the source of the problem is client config file in xap. Despite I have manually created config file with relative path, in the client config file in xaphow to see it rename .xap to .zip and then open it as normal zip file, it was modified again into the abosolute uri like the first onep  precode    addresshttplocalhost15154StaffService.svc codepre  pIt certainly could not find any service at that address at runtime. I guessed what has tooken place When I publish web site, vs recreates new client config files for each project which reference to WCF service and add this new created config file but not the one I manually created into xap. p  pIs there any remedial measures for tis problem p  pI am feeling I am very unlucky that new problems emerged after I manually turned the uri back to right. The client browser loads always the old version of the application. I have tried to clear application cache using mage cc, using Siverlight configuration tool at client, restarting IIS etc. All of them function not. I dont know if the following problems are related with I modifing the xapI doesnt check Signing the xap file.p  pI must continue to struggle with them. God help me.  p
Negative 35311 pRight now I have a main game loop that constantly redraws the screen. Since I need to slow this thread down but continue to draw other items at a faster rate I need to make a new thread. The problem is I am not sure how to go about making a new thread that also draws to the screen  I know how to make a new thread, I am just stuck on how to implement the Graphics2D drawing in the new thread. For example I have the code below which is the typical starting point and then there is the draw method defined in the other class that directs what and when to draw. If I wanted to branch off and have another thread drawing and doing its own thing how do I do that p  pDo I have to make a new class that creates an entirely new PaintComponent  Or would I simply create a new Graphics2D object so I can use different font colors and such I guess what confuses me most is that I cant just call a different draw method because I still need to pass g2d as the argument. So it appears to me that I need to make the thread from within another method that already has the g2d object. p  pIf this is confusing I do apologize as I am still a beginner to JAVA. If you need more information just let me know. Thank you in advance. p  precode public abstract void drawGraphics2D g2d    Override  public void paintComponentGraphics g  Graphics2D g2d  Graphics2Dg  super.paintComponentg2d  drawg2d   codepre

Table contains default cells with some titles codecell[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier someIdentifier]code no accessories.p  pNow i need to make popover as small as possible and do not clip text no ellipsis. Height is not a problem it is easy to fetch. I have problem with width. Previously I just measured the size of texts from table code[text sizeWithFont font].widthcode by selecting  the longest and added 20 points to result width and it was ok. Now in iOS7 this fails since cell is bit different and ellipsis is shown for the longest text.p  pIs there a good way to detect table table cell width Ive tried with code[cell sizeToFit someBigSize]code but this always returns codewidth320code. Ive tried this hoping that I will become resistant to iOS changes.p  pOr is there a specification about table cells and its layout text margins and so on, I didnt managed to find anything useful.p  pWorst case scenario I could manually figure out what is proper value to be added to maximum text width, but I prefer some documentation for that.p
Negative 35311 pI have trouble understanding what happens in the oracle database after this sql is executedp  precodeCREATE TABLE EMPTYSTRING   COLUMNA VARCHAR21   INSERT INTO EMPTYSTRING COLUMNA VALUESX  ALTER TABLE EMPTYSTRING ADD  COLUMNB VARCHAR21 DEFAULT  NOT NULL  codepre  pAs I read, oracle treats empty strings as nulls. But then why is adding a column with a default null value and a constraint that says that values cannot be null legalp  pMore importantly, since it is legal, how is this treated internaly If we tryp  precodeSELECT  FROM EMPTYSTRING WHERE COLUMNB SELECT  FROM EMPTYSTRING WHERE COLUMNB IS NULL codepre  pwe get no results. On the other hand, if we tryp  precodeSELECT  FROM EMPTYSTRING SELECT  FROM EMPTYSTRING WHERE TRIMCOLUMNB IS NULL codepre  pwe getp  precodeCOLUMNA COLUMNB   X                codepre  pSo what is really written in the database Why does it behave this wayp  pAnd if we try to insert a row without specifying a value for COLUMNBp  precodeINSERT INTO EMPTYSTRING COLUMNA VALUESY codepre  pwe get cannot insert NULL error so defaulting to empty string doesnt really work except for the rows that were in the table before we added COLUMNB.p

So I think I am hitting the problem that the bean class has been eagerly loaded before it can be loaded in the TomcatInstrumentableClassLoaderp  pIve seen warnings about this in questions such asp  pa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23445013aspectjloadtimeweavingnotworkingforspringbeansAspectJ load time weaving not working for Spring beansap  pb a hrefhttpforum.spring.ioforumspringprojectsaop123993enableloadtimeweavingisnotworkingbutcontextloadtimeweaverisworked relnofollowhttpforum.spring.ioforumspringprojectsaop123993enableloadtimeweavingisnotworkingbutcontextloadtimeweaverisworkedap  pc a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19857267unabletoapplyadvicetothirdpartylibrarylog4gloggergetloggercallusUnable to apply advice to third party library log4g  Logger.getLogger call using Spring LoadTimeWeavingap  pBut its not clear whether this is something you can work around  if you have the smarts.

Negative 35311 pI have an inherited project that parses both binary and ascii data streams from various sources fixedrepeatlength binary streams, fixedrepeatlength ascii streams, variablerepeatlength but fixednumberoffields csvlike ascii streams.  It is already runtime configurable as to on which input port to expect each format of input, defining either fixed length and what each group of bytes should be parsed as based on position, or for the variable length ones, which byte or set of bytes should be considered as the record separator and field separator, and what each field between the field separators should be parsed as.  The format of each stream is known before runtime and described in an ascii based config file.p  pHowever I now need this to be a little more generalizable to handle a new input device with basically an eitheror type of grammar.  When the device is operating normally it outputs in the following line format, one line per secondp  p6.53m,48.31p  pbut when the device detects an outofrange error condition, it outputsp  p999999p  pMy current level of configurability the inherited code doesnt let me handle this, as it is firstly not fixed length, nor does it have a consistent number of field separators per record, i.e. per line.p  pI need a parser configuration system that lets me say if theres 2 fields in the record then parse a float followed by a string constant m, and a float followed by a string constant  if theres only one field in the record, parse an int.p  pIf anyone is aware of any packages out there that have addressed this type of need, I would appreciate pointers to them.  Obviously Ive googled but I may not be using the correct terminology for this type of configurable parser so googling hasnt been very fruitful.p

It appears that the reusable views Im using are updating correctly, but the cells certainly are not.p  pHas anyone else run into this issue yet Anyone have any ideas for how to get past itp  pIm using the iOS 7.1 simulator.p

Negative 35311 pIn UNP v1, it says that if connect is not called upon a UDP socket, then this UDP socket will not return asynchronous error like port unreach to up layer application. Its reasoning is listed in Section 8.9p  blockquote   pA UDP client sends three UDP datagrams on a single UDP socket   to three servers on different hosts, then this UDP client calls recvfrom to wait for reply from these 3 servers. Suppose two of hosts are running the server, while the third is not running the server. So the third host will return a ICMP error with port unreach to this UDP client. And if recvfrom wants to return this ICMP error, it must tell client the destination IPPort so that this client knows which datagram elicited the error. But since recvfrom cant return destination IPPort to client on error, so recvfrom cant return this ICMP error as well, instead, recvfrom will block....p blockquote  pSo after reading this, I can see the reasoning is that because recvfrom cant return destination IPport to caller on error, thus recvfrom cant return asynchronous errorport unreach. But why cant recvfrom return destination IPport on error First, the ICMP message has included the IP header and UDP header, so kernel can know the destination IPPort pair, second, the fifth and sixth argument to recvfrom can be used to return this IPport pair to client application. It seems reasonable, right So can anyone explainp  ol liWhy recvfrom cant return destination Ipport to caller on error like port unreachli liWhy recvfrom cant return asynchronous error like port unreachli ol

Negative 35311 pIm trying to embed a vispy plot more specifically, a Vispy SceneCanvas as a QWidget into PyQt4. I would presume the answer would be something like thisp  precodefrom PyQt4.QtCore import  from PyQt4.QtGui import  import vispy.mplplot as plt  app  QApplicationsys.argv win  QMainWindow plt.plot[1,2,3,4], [1,4,9,16] vispyCanvasplt.show[0] win.setCentralWidgetvispyCanvas codepre  pHowever, when I try this the last line gives me the expected error that vispyCanvas is type codeSceneCanvascode and not of type codeQWidgetcode.  When I codeprintvispyCanvascode, it prints out codeltVispy canvas PyQt4 qt backend at 0x142bcb00Lgtcode, which is why I suspect that it should be possible to treat it or one of its attributes as a QWidget object.p

Negative 35311 pI am a newbie selflearning NAV. Some of queries may be foolish ones, hoping to hear from you genius experts Really confused with licensing framework.p  pstrongQueries,strongp  ol lipI can identify two types of licenses  Customer license vs Partner license. Customer license is the license for ERP product and includes system functionality packages starterextended and user accessfulllimited user. Partner license is what a dev partner subscribes to. There is no relation among those two types, rightpli lipIs a development partner able to make changes to any of the primitive objects tablescodeunits that come preinstalled with StarterExtended pack. Is development partner allowed to modifyenhance the system functionality to any extentpli lipWhen a development partner registers with Microsoft, is it given a fixed set of object IDs that it will be using to create new objects Would it be using same set of IDs for all the customers it would be implementing NAV So, these IDs are globally unique  no two dev partners be having same IDspli lipWhen I connect to RTC using my domain account,, I act as a Full User under Customer License I can see my user set as full user under DepartmentsadministrationGeneralUsers.  If I connect to NAV DEV ENVIRONMENT, I CAN design almost all the tables, but CANT any of the CODEUNITS. So, how does security work on DEV Environmentpli ol
Negative 35311 pI have a simple HTML structure, which works fine in most browsers, but in IE 10  11 the top div is not shown. As can be seen from the code segment below, I use knockout to control the visibility of the div that contains the problematic div ClassA by adding a class to make it visible and add animation. Except for the first div, everything else contained in the parent ClassA works fine. p  precode    ltdiv classClassA databindcss  classB isVisible  gt         ltdiv classselectionHeadergt             lth2 classselectionTitlegtSelect Datalth2gt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classselectionContentgt          ... codepre  pThe div is there in the DOM in IE, but is not taking up space and when you hover over it, it shows above the div that contains it, instead of being inside it. I found that if I play with the divs display status in IEs developer tools, going to displaynone and then back, the div suddenly shows, but this does not persist and if I reload the page, its hidden again.p  pI tried clearing the cache but that did not help.p  pAnyone have any idea whats going on herep  pThanks in advancep

Please note, that projects in question are big i.e. kernel with multi directories and Makefiles, so the approaches closest Makefile, default directory etc. described in the previous link are not a solution. Bonus points if you could bind it to a single key, like Fx key on modern IDEs.p  pP.S.

Negative 35311 pAt the moment I have a function which returns a list of strings. It takes a word from a view and then I would like to return to the view after the function displaying the individual words in different text boxes. However, I will not know how many words will be returned as I dont know how many the user will enter. Its only for improving my skills so it will be less than five. I have looked this up and havent really found any results which help. I thought about splitting it up on the view itself which could work or even in my ViewModel and then returning that to the view. However, like I said. I cant simply put down three text boxes as I dont know for sure how many words will be entered.

Negative 35311 pWith Spring Integration, is it possible to dynamically create additional inbound channel adapters as the program runs p  pBackground Im pretty new to SI and SBatch. Im using SI to poll our db for info that I use to create jobs in SB. Essentially, there are business rules for when the records I am pulling from the DB need to turn into a job. Im planning on making an inbound channel adapter for each rule. For instance, the rule for items in their initial state would be p  pcodeltintjdbcinboundchanneladapter          queryselect [id] from [MYDATA] where statusname  INITIAL         ....  gtcodep  pI plan on retrieving the rule info and parsing them into adapters. Instead of the hard coded rule above, I would retrieve the statusname INITIAL from the db and use that to build the adapter.p

Now, I want to know if its the best possible approach, though, I doubt that.

When I hack it with codec.asInstanceOf[SomeA]code my code compiles and my unit tests pass.  Could it be a compiler bugp  pI also thought that codeList[A[]]code was stronger typing than codeList[SomeA]code, i.e. the former was saying the list consists of codeA[T]code some emfixedem type codeTcode, where the latter is saying the list consists of codeA[T]code where codeTcode is emnot fixedem.p  pstrongBOUNSstrong If you can explain emwhyem the currently accepted answer works, i.e. why the compiler cannot work out that the type is valid without the ascription.p

Negative 35311 pI have a left main menu with a position of fixed and a width of exactly 90px. I need a secondary flyout menu to slide out from under it, from left to right. Like the main nav, it also needs to have a position of fixed, but can be variable widths. I want to use a CSS transition, so I want to start the flyout menu right at the edge right edge of the main menu, so that when the transition starts, you can immediately see the secondary menu sliding out. So heres the flyout menu before sliding outp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEPDb6.png altflyout menu under main menu before sliding outp  pand here it is after sliding outp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNJMCM.png altflyout menu after sliding out from under main menup  pI can get the final position of the flyout menu by using left 0, and marginleft 90px width of main left menu. My problem is how to use CSS no JavaScript to get the eminitialem position right edge flush with main menu right edge, that will allow me to use a CSS transition to get to the final position.p  pThe closest Ive gotten is starting at left 100, but this puts it too far to the left, so that theres a delay before you see the flyout beginning to emerge from underneath the main menu.p

Negative 35311 pIm facing a situation where I need a trycatch block within a constructor. In particular, the constructor tries to call a function in the try block and if it fails it will call another function to set some values. In both cases, the constructor should create the object properly and in both cases it has to call some other methods before it ends. The situation is as followsp    pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecode class A     Aint i          try             setDevicei                  catchDeviceExceptionamp ex             setDevice 0             throw ex                   otherMethod                       codepre  pHowever, if errors occur in the try block, codeotherMethodcode is not called because the execution ends within the catch block and I cant use finally like in other languages to do that. Furthermore, Im not even sure if, when an exception is raised inside the try block, if the destructor is automatically called and, thus, the object is not properly created.p  pWhat do you suggest in this case Is the object correctly created even if the catch block is reachedp

Negative 35311 pI am developing a lightweight graphics API for different needs where I want to render the image before it gets displayed. I have overriden the AWTs Component in order to have the highest perfomance. However, if I render the image draw lines, rectangles amp stuff in the codepaintcode method the process of painting becomes visible to the user if the method is being called frequently e.g. the window is being resized, or an animation is being played, and it is quite a perfomanceheavy solution.p  pI decided to cache and render the image separatly and simply copy the pixels to the Graphics object in the codepaintcode method. But now I dont know how to draw a single pixel to the Graphics object. I suppose the underlaying Sun implementation has such method but I should not address that class. I know that Graphics class declares several methods codedrawLinecode, codedrawRectcode, codefillRectcode, etc. that seem lightweight and can be used to only paint one pixel but I dont know which one will be the quickest.p  pI do not want to use BufferedImage due to some memory issues and thus codedrawImagecode is not a solution in this case. It is also not the case asked in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13638793whatisthefastestwaytodrawpixelsinjavathis questiona because, again, I do not use Images and I do not create new instances in the codepaintcode method the rendered image data class only changes when the component is resized.p  pstrongtldrstrong the quickest method in java.awt.Graphics to set the color of some pixel by its coordinates to a specified color java.awt.Color or RGB, last preferred.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 35311 pWe have an ASP.NET file delivery app internal users upload, external users download and Im wondering what the best approach is for distributing files so we dont have a single point of failure by only storing the apps files on one server.  We distribute the apps load across multiple front end web servers, meaning for file storage we cant simply store a file locally on the web server.  p  pOur current setup has us pointing at a share on a primary databasefile server.  Throughout the day we robocopy the contents of the share on the primary server over to the failover.  This scneario ensures we have a secondary machine with fairly current data on it but we want to get to the point where we can failover from the primary to the failover and back again without data loss or errors in the front end app.  Right now its a fairly manual process.p  pPossible solutions includep  ul liRobocopy.

Negative 35311 pthis is a hard question. Ive found nothing interesting over the web.p  pIm developing a Memory Management module for my company. We develop games for nextgen consoles Xbox 360, PS3 and PC... we consider PC a console.p  pWell need in future, for our next games, to handle texture streaming for large game worlds that cannot be loaded all in main console memory not talking about PC for now.p  pWe are going to stream at the beginning hires mipmaps of textures that is about 70 of the size of world data. Maybe in the future well have to stream also geometry, smaller mipmaps, audio, etc.p  pIm developing a Memory Manager for that issue, focused on X360 because over PS3 we can use host memory and the associated, autodefragmenting GMM allocator.p  pThe problem Im facing is the following We have decided to reserve a specific Memory Area for texture streaming for example 64 Megabytes and we want to handle all allocations and deallocations in that area. We have allocated the area at the beginning of the application and the area is Physically guaranteed to be contiguous not just virtually, cause we need to store textures there.p  pIve implemented an auto defragmenting allocator, using handles instead of pointers. Time is not an issue, the problem is memory fragmentation. In game we continuously load and unload streaming targets, so wed like to use the maximum amount of our buffer 64 Megabytes.p  pWith this allocator we can use all of the allocated space but the defragmentation routine works in an unaccettable time sometimes 60 milliseconds, more than a frames while the algorithm is not too bad... there are just too meny unevitable memcpyp  pIm looking for a solution to solve this issue. Id like to find at least a good paper, or a postmortem, or someone who have faced the same problem of mine.p  pNow Im choosing between two strategies 1 move the defragmentation routine on a dedicated thread good for X360 with 6 hw threads, bad for PS3 with just a hw thread... and dont tell me to use SPUs with all multithreading problems of locking regions, of accessing a region who is being moved,... 2 find an incremental solution to defragmentation problem we can give each frame a time budget for example up to 1 millisecond for defragmentation and the Memory Manager will do what it can do in the budget each frame.p  pCan someone tell me his experience aboutp

Negative 35311 pIm experimenting with ViewControllers amp NavigationControllers in Interface Builder trying to get a better grasp of whats tied to what and why... Im struggling with a scenario that has confused me. Hopefully someone can set me straight...p  pSay I start with your typical iPhone template ViewBased Application and I display a view which is handled by view controller viewController. Then after a certain event Id like to replace that view with a typical NavigationBased View rootVC. Id like to create as much as possible in IB. My questions have to do with how to show rootVC and remove all traces of the previous viewController as user will never need to return and wherehow to wire in the navController in IB. Currently when its time to show the rootVC I do the following in my viewControllerp  precodeRootVC rvc  [[RootVC alloc] initWithNibNameRootVC bundlenil] [rvc.view setFrame[[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame]]  ViewTestAppDelegate appDelegate  ViewTestAppDelegate [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] self.rootVC  rvc [rvc release] [appDelegate.viewController.view removeFromSuperview] [appDelegate.window addSubviewrootVC.view] [appDelegate.viewController release] codepre  prootVC displays except viewController still has a retain count of 1 p  pAlso, where should rootVCs navigationController be instantiated Having started with the ViewBased template the MainWindow.xib contains an object for the viewController which has its own ViewController.xib an appDelegate and a UIWindow. My RootVC.xib contains a UITableView. Do I need yet another intermediary view controller that will have another ApplicationDelegate object that I wire up to a UIWindow object and a UINavigationController The View Controller that comes along with IBs Navigation Controller object would then be set to my RootVC class p  pSorry for the verbosity. Its difficult for me to explain. Because some objects in IB are proxies and some are real its sometimes confusing to me when trying new things out whats required, where amp when. Basically I want to know to go about setting up one view leading to another with no way back to first view. 2nd view basically becomes the main root spawning off in many directions...p
Negative 35311 pSun is putting a lot of effort behind modularising the JDK in the form of a hrefhttpopenjdk.java.netprojectsjigsawJigsawa, and insinuating that it should be the module format of choice for other Java developers as well.

Negative 35311 pIm using Visual Studio 2005 and win32 API in C, and I have a window which was designed using the builtin dialog box editor.p  pAt runtime, I want to be able to use codeCreateWindowcode to add new controls to it.

Im not quite sure how to use this function... I was hoping that I could use codeGetWindowThemecode on the window, and then pass the result of this into codeSetWindowThemecode to make them look the same, however codeGetWindowThemecode returns a HTHEME, and I have no idea what you can even do with these... you definitely cant pass them to codeSetWindowThemecode though.p

Negative 35311 pLooking for some insight as to whether an Upsert insert or if exists, then update procedure is considered bad practice in database programming. I work in SQL server if that bears any relevance.p  pAt a place I worked some months ago, the the resident DB guru stated in newly written db coding standards most of which I agreed with, that Upserts should be avoided.p  pI cant really see a logical reason for this, and consider my self reasonably conscious of good programming practice. I think they are useful for straight forward data management and help to avoid excessive stored procedure numbers.p  pLooking for some insight  discussion that will help me come to a conclusion on this.p  pThanks.p  pstrongUpdate In response to commentsstrongp  pThe specific context I refer to is the creation or update of a domain entity data representation in the database.

Negative 35311 pIm using Hibernate with a version column to implement optimistic concurrency control.p  pThe question strongIs it possible to increment the version number of an entity every time I save it to database, regardless if it was changed or notstrongp  pAs long as some field is changed in the entity, the version number gets increased. But, if no field changed in the entity, the version number of the entity stays unchanged.p  pThe reason behind this question is that Ive got a logical masterdetail relationship between two tables and Id like to increase the version number in the master table whenever something changes in details, even if master data didnt change.

Negative 35311 pI am trying to create a mock rest service. There are basically two components to this. I need a controller with actions and views that allows me to create ResourceMappings where I create a mapping between a uri and a mock response that I will pass back. The second component is a catchall Grails url mapping for every other url so that when they hit the uri of this application they will be sent to my catch all controller that will return the mapped response that they created earlier.p  pFor example... I go to the url a hrefhttpsomeserver.com1234restMappinglist relnofollowhttpsomeserver.com1234restMappinglista. This url is the exception to the catch all rule.

Negative 35311 pI have an app that when the main home screen is loaded I check for sync updates in the background.  If there is a slow connection or a user who moves through the app fast a bunch of these requests could stack up in the background.

Negative 35311 pI have a fairly simple application which downloads files in a thread.

While it is doing this  that is, only in the situation that it cant connect to the remote host  it will use between 80100 of one CPU until it finally returns.  This can often continue for a minute or so, because of the timeout delay setting.  On one system, emin spite of the timeout settingsem noted below, this has continued for up to ten minutes.p  pHow do Ip  ul liAvoid such massive CPU usage when its just trying to connectli liSignal the thread to terminate if I want to shut down the app  Normally a timeout is fine, but if the app needs to close then it will wait on this thread to finish, which is spending lots of CPU doing very little inside codeInternetOpenUrlcode.li ul  hr  p[Aside Current timeout settings on my system, as revealed by InternetQueryOptionp  ul licodeINTERNETOPTIONCONNECTTIMEOUTcode 60sli licodeINTERNETOPTIONRECEIVETIMEOUTcode 30sli licodeINTERNETOPTIONSENDTIMEOUTcode 30sli ul  pChanging these would decrease the time before the method gave up and returned and so decrease the time spent using so much CPU, but might affect connecting  after all, the timeouts are there for a reason.  This app can be used in odd connection situations, such as on board ship, where connecting could potentially be over satellite with high latency and take longer than a standard desktop internet connection.  I do not know what reasonable timeouts would be. Also, there has to be a better method to avoid the CPU usage and terminate more quickly than simply shortening the timeouts.]p

Negative 35311 pI kind of have a mess going right now, but the gist is I can run rake specrcov successfully and get a report but all it shows as being covered is the def lines of my code. None of the code inside the methods is being run according to rcov.p  pSpecifically I have a disppricetxt method in my application helper. I have written specs, that pass in rspec, in spechelpersapplicationhelperspec.rb. However rcov is not showing the code as being run.p  pMy gems are below. Im using ree 1.8.7head. I started out by installing Metrical and was going to uses simplecov until I realized it was for 1.9 only. Then I went back to rcov.p  prails 3.1.1 rspec 2.8.0, 2.7.0 rspeccore 2.8.0, 2.7.1 rspecexpectations 2.8.0, 2.7.0 rspecmocks 2.8.0, 2.7.0 rspecrails 2.8.1, 2.7.0 rcov 0.9.11p  pHopefully this is enough to get some input. If any other info is needed let me know. Thanks.p

Negative 35311 pI have two jqGrids that load data via an ajax POST call to my controller and each time I run the application, only one of the two POSTs executes successfully. Normally, if i hit refresh on the browser, both grids will load correctly. But consistently 1 of the 2 fail on first load of each view  i have two viewspages that each have 2 jqGrids, dashboard style. In log4net logs the two requests have different threads and one always fails while the other succeeds but which one succeeds is random probably firstcome, firstserve... Sometimes i get a null reference error when it tries to iterate through a resulting enumerable list of items, other times i get The connection was not closed. The connections current state is connecting.p  pI have some suspicions of what might be the cause of this EF lazy loadingproxies enabled, bad windsor configuration, automapper error that is not being thrown or shown in stack trace.

Negative 35311 pSo I have an NSArray with custom objects called Church. And in each church there is an array of mass times. So there is a method in church which calculates the closest mass to the users current time. p  precodeNSDate closestTimeToNSDate currentTime codepre  pI want to be able to sort the NSArray of Church by the results which are NSDate returned by that method for each object. Basically to get a sorted list of masses sorted by the closest time and also location.p  pIm using categories and cant store the closest times as properties since its a core data object. I also dont think its a good idea to save those values to core data as these methods will be called constantly due to location services.p  pAny ideas on how I can sort such array using the result of its objects methodp
Negative 35311 pFor developing an devices monitor system, I am using a InetAdress codeisReachablecode method to know if the device in a network is online or not.I am using the codeScheduledExecutorServicecode along with list of devices to ping the codeicmpcode devices concurrently.p  pNow if the devices number is lowsay 60 devices to be pinged by codeScheduledExecutorServicecode with a pool of 10 threads,it works fine..Means result will correctly show the device status.Here the codeisReachablecode has a time out of 5000 ms. If the devices number gets increased say to 80, some devices shows the offline status with codeisReachablecode method even if the device is online.If I increase the time out of codeisReachablecode method to 10000 ms, the devices status can have better chance to have a correct status.p  pFrom these devices, most of the devices are Linux based system and codeisReachablecode always return the correct status for them but for Windows, the behavior is unpredictable.

Negative 35311 pSo Im trying to place a Kinect driven model on a known ground plane such that his feet do not go below the ground.  Im using the Kinect SDK sample setup, the Dude.FBX model, and using the SkeletonJointsSensorOffsetCorrection class to move the model off the floor based on the Kinect sensor floor plane.  This works pretty well and allows me to jump, which is pretty important.  However, when I bend my knees to squat down a little, the model applies a constraint filter to prevent the joints from bending too far.  This meas that the hip moves down properly, but the models legs dont bend all the way like mine are, so the feet clip through the floor since they have to go somewhere.p  pWhat I want to do is alter the positions and rotations of the models feetknees after all other filters are run so that they dont go through the ground plane.  However, Im stuck on two pointsp  ol liHow do I ask the model not the Kinect Skeleton if its feet are below a certain Yli liHow do move the feet up to 0 and rotate the knee and hip joints to be somewhat natural again, on the model, not the Kinect Skeletonli ol  pThe Kinect Skeleton is correct.  Its seeing everything in the right place.  But the model interprets that info in a way that I want to adjust after the fact.  I just dont know the best way to go about it.  Any ideasp  pThanks, everyone.p

Negative 35311 pI will try my best at explaining my problem, maybe my approach is not even the way to do this, but here it isp  pIve been tasked with rebuilding a training aid that will allow railroad instructors to use a fake railroad and build scenarios based on the discussion. The instructor starts out with a rail yard that only has tracks, NO CARS or LOCOMOTIVES. Heres a screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsTtcG.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe instructor will have several objects below that map that heshe can drag and drop onto the rail yard to illustrate scenarios, heres a screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRAP4R.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe objects are in my library and a single object is placed on the stage when the swf first runs. I have made an object array that has the linked name, x, and y coordinates of where I want the object to be placed when its attached. Here is the object and loop to put item on the stagep  pThere are a total of about 50 items, but this example will only show two.p  pObject Arrayp  precodevar objectArray  [objnamedetector,x20,y680,objnamelocomotive,x270,y610] codepre  pAttach Movie Loopp  precode pulls objects from library and places on the stage  forvar i in objectArray      var name  StringobjectArray[i].obj.name     var xx    objectArray[i].obj.x     var yy    objectArray[i].obj.y     this.attachMoviename,name,this.getNextHighestDepth,xxx,yyy     this[name].onRelease  function              Clonethis       codepre  pWhen the instructor starts building the scenario heshe will click on the object and it will place a duplicate of that object on the stage outside the object area. Then heshe can drag and drop that duplicate anywhere on the stage. In the for loop you can see I call the codeClonecode function, here that isp  pClone Functionp  precodevar numberNumber  0 var cloneArrayArray  [] function ClonemcVoid      var clone  Stringclone  numberused to make unique clone names     cloneArray.pushclonebuild array so I can remove objects from stage       duplicate objects      mc.duplicateMovieClipclone,100number,y580,xStage.width2       set press event      this[clone].onPress  function              this.swapDepths10000bring to the top         this.startDragfalse,0,0,1024,580drag to constraints            set release event      this[clone].onRelease  function              this.stopDrag         ifmc.name  loco  mc.name  car                      BuildTrainthis                codepre  pAll this works great, but where I run into problems is when the instructor wants to build a train. So what I mean by that is, the instructor will place a locomotive on the stage, then place a tank car on the stage, the instructor will drag the tank car and drop it on top of the locomotive and the tank car will snap behind it the locomotive inline. When that happens the tank car will now follow the locomotive if the instructor wants to drag it somewhere. So its like there are now one unit. This instructor could want 20 cars behind the locomotive ... and he might want to build more than one train. Here is a screenshot of a locomotive and car snapped togetherp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comM3KaU.jpg altenter image description herep  pHeres some code that allows me to snap the cars together, which works fine, but my problem is I cant drag the objects around as one unit after all the cars have been snappedp  pBuildTrainp  precodefunction BuildTrainVoid      forvar i in consistArray              var value  consistArray[i]         var math   mc.width  this[value].width         var space  1  this is the space between cars         ifevalmc.droptarget.name  value                      mc.x  this[value].x  math  2  space             mc.y  this[value].y                codepre  pSo codeClonecode does snap one car to the locomotive and car to car if you want to build a long train. Where the problem lies is I cannot figure out how to make them one unit after they are snapped. I thought about maybe building an array using a parent child relationship, but In not sure.p  pI know this is a long post, but some background hopefully helped.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIm playing around with the idea that Amy had below since it seems logical that a child that resides inside a parent would just follow the parent.

Negative 35311 pI have a set of entities that connect to each other forming a cycle i.e., parent entity P has two onetomany relationships with two child entities C1 and C2 and each one of these has a onetomany relationship with another entity A.

All the relationships are navigable in both directions.  br img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRcMkA.png altdomain objects br The following question arises from this design What should be the cascade strategy so that entity A can be persistedmerged, given that you always invoke entity manager operations on the root entity P Should A be cascade reachable from both pathsp  pstrongConsiderationsstrong It seems that if the application chooses to provide only one cascade path there can be scenarios that throw a TransientObjectException.

Negative 35311 pThis is a strange problem that Im having, and Im not sure whether its an Umbraco issue or something more high level.p  pTo explain we have a node where a backend user uploads a file, and then ticks a box and presses save. When they press save, if the tickbox is ticked, then we should process what they uploaded. To achieve this, I call a function using the codeDocument.AfterSafe  new Document.SaveEventHandlerMethodCallcode line, and then I check that the checkbox is ticked, and go from there.p  pThis all works for the first time. But when a user uploads a new file a couple of days later, the code doesnt run. The only way to get it to run, is to recopy the .dll into the bin folder, and then press save.p  pDoes this ring a bell for anyone at all It seems as though the .dll stops listening for the SaveEventHandler after the first time.p

Negative 35311 pThe existing software uses C to code the communication layer as a single object. Microsoft COM object is used to connect the communication object to the upper layer of the UI. It exposes interfaces using the COM object.p  pNew software requires me to create a completely different communication object that is radically different from the existing communication object. I can either choose to code it in C as a separate class or create another COM object and reuse some of the C code to create the object.p  pBeing a C native, I want to hear your advices before making a decision on how this future software change should be made. I feel that if I create another COM object, it seems unnecessary as a C class within the upper layer can handle it. But then I get to reuse some of the code. p  pThanksp

Negative 35311 pI follow the usual recommendations of serializing javascript Date objects to be sent to the server by using the toISODate js function.p  pIn fact Breeze.js is doing this for me which is great. Everything works as expected when the property on my Entity is a DateTime  the date gets saved to the database as a UTC 0 offset date datetime.p  pstrongI hit a problem when the property on the Entity is of type stringstrong. A date that is sent over the wire as em20130608T230000Zem is being deserialized into the strongstringstrong property on the Entity as em06082013 230000em and this is the same value that is saved into the varchar backing column in the database.p  pSo the date is being deserialized into a strongenUSstrong formatted date MMddyyyy HHmmss. Im stuck as to why this is happening or how to change things so that the emstringem remains intact as its deserialized into a emstringem property.p  pA few technical notesp  ul liI confirmed the deserialized value in the property by wiring up a BeforeSaveEntitiesDelegate to the EFContextProvider and inspected the Entity instance in the debugger just before it was savedli liwhen inspecting the entity in the BeforeSaveEntitiesDelegate method on the server, I noted that the Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture were both enGBli lifor technical reasons I need to use a string property rather than a DateTime or DateTimeOffset  basically the property could receive any type of data so string is the universal format that will fit everything.li ul  pHelp would be most welcomep  pThanks Christian Crowhurstp

Negative 35311 pIve been trying to get some feature detecting and matching algorithms working I seek hands, but they give me poor results. I found a template code for feature detection and matching, which uses homography matrix and perspective transformation for locating the matched template object in the scene picture which is the camera input. Ive been seeking for parameter calibration or something that might help, but i couldnt find too much information, what i used in the code, is from different sites from the internet. I usually get false results, the algorithms think that they found enough good matches to draw the found object. Unfortunately I barely get good results and to make this happen, I usually need a homogeneous background.  I use Gauss smoothing or Median filter as preprocessing.

Negative 35311 pIve been working on quite a nice program for a month or two now. Im having an odd issue where clicking a marker on my map is giving a very vague script error. Literally just last night everything was working fine and all of a sudden this is happening.p  pFirst, heres a brief look at my map. As soon as this form VB loads, a list of records is pulled from my SQL Server database. A marker with a unique ID is created for each record. An InfoWindow is made for each marker, and the InfoWindow is filled with details from the columns for that record. I seriously had this part working flawlessly. I can click different markers on the map, and have their InfoWindow opened while closing the previous InfoWindow if one was already open.p  pSorry for having to post these as links, I dont have the 10 reputation to post images. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comw3s8R.png alt Now, all of a sudden when I click on a marker, I get the following script error. If I choose Yes, another script error is shown. I cant figure out whats going on. If I comment out effectively disabling my click event for the marker, there is no script error, but of course the InfoWindows wont work. I did this to see if the script errors come up with the map just idling. Ive tried clearing the content of the InfoWindow leaving just test as its content to rule that out still get the script errors. I cant tell if this may be something going on on Googles end, I dont know. Is that possible The URL noted in the first script error indicates that its a problem in that script, which I think would indicate that this could be on their endp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commgZf2.png alt And finally, my .htm. I should clarify that I am doing this in a Visual Basic program. I have a container on my form which I create and place a WebBrowser object into. Then I have the WebBrowser load this .htm page. This worked amazingly as of just a night or two ago and I cant figure out the problem. Ive even opened a backup from two weeks ago and this isnt working.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgtlttitlegtlttitlegt     ltmeta nameviewport contentinitialscale1.0, userscalableno gt     ltstyle typetextcssgt         html              height 100                   body              height 100             margin 0             padding 0                   mapcanvas              height 100              ltstylegt      ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpsmaps.googleapis.commapsapijssensortruegt ltscriptgt      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          var map         var Markers  []          function InitializezoomLevel, lat, lng, type              Get the type of map to start.

Negative 35311 pI am making a game with some friends. At the moment, we are trying to get the controls working as they should, i.e. WASD to move in the 4 main directions, and use the mouse to rotate the view. p  pThe problem is that we are running into difficulties with the matrices, specifically the view matrix. I have read more tutorials than I care to count on matrices over the past few weeks, and I understand the basic principles, and how to do some simple stuff, but I am still lacking that fundamental understanding of how it all comes together. p  pRight now, our main problem is getting the camera transformations to act as one would expect. Using the tutorials I have seen, the camera transformations all take place along the local axis, which causes some strange behavior, for instance, after moving around a bit, I can easily end up sideways, or even upsidedown. p  pThese are the two functions I am using for rotating the view matrix, as seen in all the tutorials ive looked atp  precodedef xrotateM,theta t  math.pitheta180 cosT  math.cos t  sinT  math.sin t  R  numpy.array     [[ 1.0,  0.0,  0.0, 0.0 ],      [ 0.0, cosT,sinT, 0.0 ],      [ 0.0, sinT, cosT, 0.0 ],      [ 0.0,  0.0,  0.0, 1.0 ]], dtypenp.float32 M[...]  np.dotM,R  def yrotateM,theta t  math.pitheta180 cosT  math.cos t  sinT  math.sin t  R  numpy.array     [[ cosT,  0.0, sinT, 0.0 ],      [ 0.0,   1.0,  0.0, 0.0 ],      [sinT,  0.0, cosT, 0.0 ],      [ 0.0,  0.0,  0.0, 1.0 ]], dtypenp.float32 M[...]  np.dotM,R codepre  pHow would I go about applying view matrix transformations in global spacep  pOh, and also, if you know of any really good matrix tutorials that dont just say the math here is complicated so we wont go into it, just know it works, I would love to take a look.p

Negative 35311 pBackground I am a C programmer learning Java. Please be patientp  pI Recently came across some code demonstrating how to implement a simple singly linked list helper class in Java.

How is this situation different from the C example above Wont codeoldfirstcode fall out of scope with codefirst.nextcode pointer to nothing Is it a Java thing, an OOP thing, or am I just getting confusedp  pEDIT I understand that Java does not have pointers and thus the analogy with C is not perfect. However, as far as I am aware, like C, it is passbyvalue, and when objects are concerned this translates to passreferencebyvalue. What I dont understand is how the variable remains in scope after the closure endsp
