Negative 62392 pI have been looking around for the answer to this, but no joy.  In Java, is using the lock created by ReentrantReadWriteLock equivalent to getting the read and write locks as returned by readLock.lock and writeLock.lock  In other words, can I expect the read and write locks associated with the ReentrantReadWriteLock to be requested and held by synchronizing on the ReentrantReadWriteLockp  pMy gut says no since any object can be used for synchronization.  I wouldnt think that there would be special behavior for ReentrantReadWriteLock.  However, special behavior is the corner case of which I may not be aware.p  pThanks, Toddp

Negative 62392 pI am working on a personal project as a way of learning more about C and .NET, specifically creating an application that utilises a database MS SQL Server 2008 in my case.  Whilst I appreciate there isnt always a definitive right way of doing things, given the choice between using an old technologyidea or a new one, I would rather use the new one.  For example, one of my aims for this project is to learn, or at least familiarise myself with, WPF rather than using WinForms as I have done in the past.p  pOn that basis, Ive been muddling around without a great deal of direction with regards to saving data to my database and retrieving it.  So far Ive managed to get both those working using codeTableAdapterscode but I feel like they are the old way of working my basis for this is that they are listed under Visual Studio 2005 on MSDN.  Firstly, am I correct in this assumption  If so, what are the newer methods of saving and retrieving data from a database  I would be grateful of any pros and cons each method offers.p  pIve Googled and searched MSDN extensively but I dont feel like I am using the correct search terms as I have only succeeded in confusing myself.p  pI have .NET 3.5, Visual Studio 2008 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 at my disposal.p  pAny guidance would be much appreciated.p

Negative 62392 pThis week Ive been working on some reflectionbased code, and during unit testing found an unexpected condition pointers are reference types. The C code codetypeofint.MakePointerType.IsClasscode returns codetruecode.p  pI checked in my justarrived Annotated CLI Standard, and sure enough, pointers are clearly defined as reference types.p  pThis was surprising to me, coming from a C background. I had just assumed that pointers would be value types.p  pIs there a particular reason why pointer types are reference types and not value typesp  pstrongUpdate clarificationstrongp  pWhen talking about pointers and references, things often get confusing regarding the pointer and pointee. So heres some clarification.p  pemTypesem can be reference types or value types, but emvariablesem are a bit different.

Both codeycode and codexcode refer to the same instance of the pointer object.li ol  pPerhaps Im completely wrong in this interpretation.p  pComing from a C background, it would make more sense to me for pointers to be value types, so the statement codex  ampicode is just assigning the address of codeicode to the instance of the value type codexcode, and codey  xcode copies that address value into codeycode. No pointer object would be created on the heap.p

Negative 62392 pMy understanding is that it means that one can potentially write a program to formally prove that a program written in a statically typed language will be free of a certain small subset of defects.p  pMy problem with this is as followsp  pAssume that we have two turing complete languages, A and B. A is presumed to be type safe and B is presumed not to be. Suppose I am given a program L to check the correctness of any program written in A. What is to stop me from translating any program written in B to A, applying L. If P translates from A to B then why isnt  PL a valid type checker for any program written in Bp  pIm trained in Algebra and am only just starting to study CS so there might be some obvious reason that this doesnt work but I would very much like to know.

Negative 62392 pIve got a WCF service operation that just does a LINQ query on a SQL database, looking up 1 of 35 records that have a matching Guid its really as simple as it gets. When I call this method from a simple sandbox application, it comes back right away. However, when I have it running in a windows service, the first call to the method takes about 25 seconds I take a timestamp before and after the call, and the second call identical in every way to the first, made immediately after the first, just for testing purposes comes back right away.p  pThe call takes place inside of a ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem delegate, with other actions being performed before and after it, and its the only thing in the entire delegate that is at all delayed.p  pDoes the delay make sense, or is something going wrong here.p  pUpdate Ive confirmed that the problem isnt with the method itself. I called a completely different service method first, which had that delay, and the two calls to the original method just after both execute instantaneously. So it really is whatever the first call to the server is thats causing the problem.p

Negative 62392 pI have table columns with values in them and when you click the edit button, I am creating a textbox with the column value in it, kind of like an editinplace feature.p  precodevar title  item.find.coedittitle.htmlltinput typetext stylewidth240px nametitle value  item.find.coedittitle.text   gt codepre  pWorks fine, the input box appears with the value supplied. The problem is that in FF, Chrome, and Safari, the textbox doesnt behave like it normally would. The backspace key works fine but normal keyboard functionality doesnt.p  pFor instance, SHIFT  arrow doesnt highlight characters and the left and right arrow keys dont move the cursor left and right. The up and down keys move the cursor left and right for some reason. Finally, in IE there are these same problems in addition to the backspace key acting as if it is not in the textbox, it makes the browser go back a page.p  pAny thoughts on why this is happeningp  pEDIT Should have pointed this out before but all of this is happening inside of a Fancybox popup which is displaying inline content that is already on the page.

Negative 62392 pIn Java, with Suns JDK 1.6, with an enum such as thisp  precodepublic enum MyEnum      FIRSTMEMBER  public void foo   ,     SECONDMEMBER  public void foo   ,      THIRDMEMBER  public void foo     codepre  pThe compiled files are  p  precodeMyEnum1.class  MyEnum2.class  MyEnum3.class  MyEnum.class  codepre  pThis also means that a stack trace showing codefoocode, or the method call printed in JVisualVM, etc., will have something like this at the topp  precodemypackage.MyEnum1.run codepre  pThe code1code in the class name is due to the members of the enum being compiled to anonymous inner classes. I am wondering if it is safe to assume that the numbers used in these class names map to the order in which the enum members are defined If it is not, is there a standard, guaranteed way to find the enum member from the number used as the anonymous class namep  hr  pEDITp  pIn regards to the design of the enum, this was used for illustration purposes only. The real enum implements an interface, and each member provides a different implementation of the methods. Please dont pay too much attention to what admittedly looks a bit strange. p  hr  pEDIT 2p  pTo clarify, I am not trying to do anything with this information emprogrammaticallyem such as weird reflection nonsense.

Negative 62392 pIm working on a Linux kernel driver that makes a chunk of physical memory available to user space. I have a working version of the driver, but its currently very slow. So, Ive gone back a few steps and tried making a small, simple driver to recreate the problem.p  pI reserve the memory at boot time using the kernel parameter codememmap2G1Gcode. Then, in the drivers codeinitcode function, I codeioremapcode some of this memory, and initialize it to a known value.

Why on earth is it so slowp  pThis is kernel 2.6.34 on Fedora 13, and its an x8664 system.p  pEDITp  pThe goal behind this scheme is to take a chunk of physical memory and make it available to both a PCI device via the memorys busphysical address and a user space application via a call to codemmapcode, supported by the driver. The PCI device will then continually fill this memory with data, and the userspace app will read it out. If codeioremapcode is a bad way to do this as Ben suggested below, Im open to other suggestions thatll allow me to get any large chunk of memory that can be directly accessed by both hardware and software. I can probably make do with a smaller buffer also.p  hr  pSee my eventual solution below.p

Negative 62392 pI will appreciate your advice on the following. Iam developing a video converter which based on FFmpegs libavformat, and I need to implement an accurate seeking API. First of all, I developed an indexer of video stream which just saves a presentation timestampsPTS of every packet. And then my encoder uses this index to seek the video file. Before this operations, I remux file to mp4 container, for example. Remux is needed for videos which have no correct index inside, or video has no index at all. I need to implement seeking by bytes, of course with previously built index. I tried many ways to implement this, but without any success. Maybe you know how to implement an accurate seeking by bytes in FFmpeg Best regards.p

The specifics here are confusing me though By my understanding, we are creating a new thread with pthreadcreate, its running the functionC process, which increments a counter. The counter is the protected variable, and, since both functions are running concurrently, the counter would return the wrong value if it was not protected by the mutex.p  pIs this correctclose  Thanks a lot .p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltpthread.hgt  void functionC pthreadmutext mutex1  PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER int  counter  0  main     int rc1, rc2    pthreadt thread1, thread2      Create independent threads each of which will execute functionC      if rc1pthreadcreate ampthread1, NULL, ampfunctionC, NULL            printfThread creation failed dn, rc1         if rc2pthreadcreate ampthread2, NULL, ampfunctionC, NULL            printfThread creation failed dn, rc2          Wait till threads are complete before main continues.

For reporting purposes, I need to get a snapshot of users who have an active alert in the system.p  pExample tablesp  precodeEmailAlerts UserName    Type    Status Alice       1   0 Alice       1   0 Alice       1   1 Alice       2   0 Alice       2   1 Alice       2   1 Bob         1   1 Bob         2   1 Mallory     1   1 Mallory     2   1  TextAlerts UserName    Type    Status Alice       1   1 Alice       2   0 Alice       2   1 Bob         1   0 Mallory     1   1 Mallory     2   1 codepre  pThis will be put in a csv file, and the final result for the example tables should look like thisp  precodeUsername, ActiveType1Email, ActiveType2Email, ActiveType1Text, ActiveType2Text Alice, Yes, Yes, No, Yes Bob, No, No, Yes, No codepre  pSo, for each unique user, find out if they have an active status  0 email or text alert of either type. They can have multiple alerts for both types. The users are stored in Sitecore so there is no user table.p  pAt the moment Im first getting all the unique usernames, then looping through each one to find out what alerts they have. It works, but its pretty horrible so Id like to find a better solution. Is it possible to do it all in one query Would a stored procedure be a better way of doing it If anyone can point me in the right direction I can try to figure out the code myself, Im just not sure of best way to tackle it.p  pUPDATE Heres the current ugly codep  precodepublic static ListltDictionaryltstring, stringgtgt GetUserAlertsForCSV      ListltDictionaryltstring, stringgtgt alerts  new ListltDictionaryltstring, stringgtgt      var usernames  from e in db.EmailAlerts select e.UserName.Union                     from t in db.TextAlerts select t.UserName.Distinct      foreach var username in usernames              Dictionaryltstring, stringgt d  new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt         d.Addusername, username         bool hasActiveAlert  false          var activeType1Email  from e in db.EmailAlerts                     join a in db.AlertStatusCodes on e.Status equals a.StatusCode                     where e.UserName  username                     ampamp e.Type  intAlertType.Type1                     ampamp a.Description  active                     select e.FirstOrDefault          if activeType1Email  null                      d.Addtype1email, Yes             hasActiveAlert  true                  else                      d.Addtype1email, No                    repeat the above for activeType1Text, activeType2Email and activeType2Text          if hasActiveAlert                      alerts.Addd                    return alerts  codepre  pThanks,p  pAnneliep

Negative 62392 pIm building an application using the OpenCmis library to communicate with Cmis repositories. The librairy itself call REST services using the HttpUrlConnection object. So I dont have any access to the connection object. The authentication is made directly by the transport protocol  So the server returns a http error 401 Unauthorize when the provided credentials are wrong, the library catch the exception, raised a CmisSomethingException, the application manages it and everything works fine.p  pEverything works fine, until I tried to test the application outside my dev environment. The application is started from a JNLP and when I use it from there... some internal Java handling seems to outrun the library handling, catch the 401 error and pop a Java login dialog asking for credentials. p  pIt works well if the user provides valid username and password. The login dialog is reshowned if the credentials are wrong. And finally, the 401 error is finally catched by the librairy and passed to the application if the login dialog is cancelled by the user.p  pThe Look, the functionnalites  and the feedback provided by this dialog to the user are not what we want.p  pDoes anybody now how to bypassget rid of this dialog when using the app from Java web startp  pThanks p  pJeffp

Negative 62392 pI created a virtual drive in C using the Dokan.NET library, and its working quite well.p  pHowever, when I try to read a file from the drive in another application I get an exception whenever using operations that read synchronously, like codeSystem.IO.File.ReadAllText...code.p  pThe text of the exception is Handle does not support synchronous operations.

Negative 62392 pI have a couple custom preference items  one that displays a swatch of the currently selected color, and another one that displays a thumbnail.p  pI have a custom layout for these that matches up very well, and have found that I can make the text appearance match by using androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceLarge as part of the TextViews xml.  The problem is, while these generally look fine, they must not be the appearance the official preferences use, since the colors end up wrong on some devices.  In particular Im porting my application to the Nook Color, and it uses a light grey background and black text color on the preference screen instead of black backgroundlight grey text.  My text color in this situation stays the same, but the rest of my layout is themed appropriately.p  pIm really unsure what Im supposed to do here to make my text match up with the official theme.  Should I be using obtainStyledAttributes and running though my layout to set things  The tutorials Ive seen on using that so far have been really baffling, and it seems like there must be a textAppearance or style I can set in the XML to fix this.p

Negative 62392 pI have a physics simulation using Box2D where bodies with identical integer IDs do not collide, for instance, bodies that belong to the same character.  I have a problem though in that I need to be able to get a unique number for each possible entity, so that no two characters accidentally get the same ID.  Theres a finite number of bodies, but they are created and destroyed as the simulation dictates, so its necessary to free unique IDs once the body they belonged to is gone.p  pA class codeWorldcode is responsible for creating and destroying all bodies, and is also the entity that manages the unique number generation, and anything else where physics simulation is concerned.p  pI thought of two methods so far but Im not sure which would be better, if either of them at allp  ul lipKeep a codevectorltshortgtcode, with the data being the number of references floating around, and the position in the vector being the ID itself.  This method has the disadvantage of creating unneeded complexity when coding entities that manipulate group IDs, since they would need to ensure they tell the codeWorldcode how many references theyre taking out.pli lipKeep a codevectorltboolgtcode, with the data being if that ID is free or not, and the position in the vector being the ID itself.  The vector would grow with every new call for a unique ID, if there exist no free slots.

Negative 62392 pI have recently been looking at handling API levels fragmentation and found a great a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.com201007howtohaveyourcupcakeandeatittoo.html relnofollowstrongtutorialstronga on supporting different API Levels in your source codep  pAs stated in the tutorial, in order to avoid runtime error of using newer classesmethods than the API Level ones should check the API level and use lazy loading.p  pI have checked the code and can confirm that on Android lt2.0 you must use lazy loading to avoid VerifyError. What was a huge surprise for me was that in 2.1 the lazy loading is not necessary anymore.p  pI will use the codeCamera.setDisplayOrientationcode method to demonstrate the issue.

And I have double checked the Camera interface, and found that the setDisplayOrientation method was only introduced in Froyo 2.2.p  pOn the contrary if I try to call the method I will get an exception, i.e.p  precodepublic void surfaceChangedSurfaceHolder holder, int format, int w, int h         final int APIversion  Integer.parseIntBuild.VERSION.SDK     camera.setDisplayOrientation90  codepre  pOn strongEclairstrong this will throw codeNoSuchMethodErrorcode.p  pWhy does it work Does it have anything to do with class verification being turned offp  pstrongPSstrong I have checked that the setDisplayOrientation indeed doesnt exist in Eclair 2.1.

Negative 62392 pId like to find the best way to manage releases using Maven 2, Bamboo 3.1 and JIRA 4.3. Ive tried many things but I keep hitting dead ends due to bugs or missing functionality.p  pMy end goal is to have versions come from JIRA, have Bamboo take those versions and build artefacts from them using Maven then deploy those artefacts to a repository Nexus in our case.p  pHere are the approaches I have triedp  p1 Use a place holder in all poms for project versionsp  pParent pomp  precodeltproject ...gt   ltgroupIdgtgroupltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtparentltartifactIdgt   ltversiongtci.versionltversiongt   ...   ltmodulesgt...ltmodulesgt ltprojectgt codepre  pChild pomp  precodeltproject ...gt   ltparentgt     ltgroupIdgtgroupltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtparentltartifactIdgt     ltversiongtci.versionltversiongt   ltparentgt   ltartifactIdgtchildltartifactIdgt   ... ltprojectgt codepre  pThis builds if you start the build from the project root pom and specify codeDci.versionltmyversiongtcode on the command line. Combine this with the a hrefhttpsplugins.atlassian.complugindetails28559 relnofollowBamboo Release Management Plugina and I can build and deploy versions of my modules and release as needed.p  pThe problem with this approach is that Maven does not replace place holder variables in poms when deploying or installing which means the poms in the repository have the codeci.versioncode marker when Id really like them to have the concrete version. Because of the place holder it means nobody can use the modules I deploy. See a hrefhttpjira.codehaus.orgbrowseMNG2971 relnofollowMNG2971a.p  p2 Use concrete SNAPSHOT versions in the pom and configure bamboo to execute the a hrefhttpmaven.apache.orgpluginsmavenreleaseplugin relnofollowMaven Release Plugina using the Bamboo Release Management Plugin.p  pUnfortunately the Maven Release Plugin needs the version to increment to, the bamboo plugin allow you to get the name of the current version to build but not the next one. Without this information using the Maven Release Plugin would increment the version to something that is not managed by JIRA. To make this option work Id either need the next version available to me or be able to run a plan after the Bamboo Release Management Plugin has done its thing this second fix would also add extra mess to the commit logs as youd get one commit for the auto increment and one for the proper increment.p  p2.b Same as 2 but you have to specify the next version in Bamboo before any release build through the plan configuration interface, setting the value manually to the next JIRA version the plan should be working on. This fixes the problem with 2 but adds extra manual steps.p  p3 Do things manually, probably using the Maven Release Plugin. Completely ignore all release functionality in Bamboo and manually manage released on the command line by calling the Maven Release Plugin goal to change the version as and when needed. JIRA versions will also need to be released manually when this happens. We also need to configure a bamboo build to run and test the tag that the release plugin creates for the nonSNAPSHOT version.p  pThis option has so much process involved something is bound to go wrong.p  pI cant be the only person trying to get automated releases using these technologies, can anyone help.p  pThanksp
Negative 62392 pI have a button in my app which leads to the UpdateActivity. This activity doesnt show anything just a progress bar and there is an AsyncTask running with the updates. p  pThe AsyncTask takes quite a long time because I conect to a server and retrieve info from many tables and inserting them in the sqlite database and sending data from local database to the server. p  pI am wondring if its not better to use a service for this is it On the other hand I have a doubt. When I press the back button I leave that activivty but the AsyncTask seems to be running in the back because I have a toast to inform the user the jobs done and it shows much later even if I have left that activity. p  pThen I have another activity which requires data to be read and written tofrom the db so if I am doing that while another thread the downloading thread is messing up with the database too, is it possible that something goes wrong Is there a way to prevent that  thanks in advancep

Window is usually declared as an array of windows, and each window has its own set of controls window needs to be an array in order for me to emulate general window behavior, such as clicking a window and bringing it to the front using a zOrder which is emulated using a collection.p  pResearch has shown me that you can listen to events in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIronPython relnofollowIronPythona.p  pFor examplep  precodedef handleargs      print args  from System.IO import  w  FileSystemWatcher w.Path  . w.Changed  handle w.Created  handle w.Deleted  handle codepre  pHowever that doesnt help me hook to events that are firing in the main application which is what I would like to be able to do.p  pI do know I can share objects with IronPython scope.SetVariablex, 100 for example, however passing an object seems to pass the object at the state it was when I passed it creating a new independent object, with the same value like doing thisp  precodeDim a as MyClass Dim b as New MyClass a  b codepre  pThis would be fine for just communicating between the two, but it doesnt let me act on a VB.NET event from within Python, as they are now separate objects.p  pThe idea is that when a button is clicked for example, I should be able to write a Python script to act on that button press, and thus run the form through a set of controls like labels, buttons, textboxes, and allow optional direct access to mouse input for that particular window for custom controls by loading images in an image class.p  pI am able to do all of this already, except handleing a VB.NET event from Python. I was considering cheating by handling all the events myself and setting a set of variables for example, codeScope.SetVariableEvent, ButtonPresscode, but I was wondering if there was a way of doing this properly.p  pThanks.p

Negative 62392 pI have an existing site build in c 3.5 using asp.net mvc 1.p  pThere is a section of the site that requires additional behaviour.  Basically there is a need to configure an object that is in one of the base libraries to have extended features.  If these extended features have been specified on the object, then additional contentfunctionality should be exposed within the details page of this object.  p  pIn terms of extending my object with new functionality I was thinking of using the decorator pattern, creating an extendedobject with additional properties etc which I could persist to another database table.  I would manage all of this within an extensions library.p  pMy problems start at the controllerview level.  All of the controller actions have already been written and are in the base library that I do not want to modify.  I can make minor modifications to these  however, no breaking changes can be introduced, and all existing functionality should be maintained as the library is used elsewhere. I can however, create as many new controllersservices as I like.p  pTo makes things more complicated, this extended functionality is not required for all of the existing objects within the site.  The client will need to be able choose to convert certain instances of these objects to the extended type when viewing the details page for the object. p  pThis makes my details page very messy.  I now need to figure out if the object has been extended already, and if not show the controls which allows the user to convert it to the extended type.  If the object has been extended then I will have to display out all its extended content out onto the page.  This would be oki if the functionality was isolated to a specific section of the page yay, one renderaction, but the extended content will be output throughout various parts of the page.  It seems messy doing a load of different renderactions everywhere, which should only output different content based on whether it is an extended object or not.p  pI half considered doing a single ajax query, and then dynamically rendering each of the sections using javascript when the details page has loaded.p  pI dont want to break or change the existing libraries governing the base functionality of this site.p  pWhat is the best way to approach this type of problemp

Negative 62392 pIm having a problem working with Cultures, MVC3 and Data Annotations. I defined a table codeSTOREScode on a spanish database codeCOLLATION is set for LATINGENERALcode some of the fields are defined in SQL as codeDECIMAL18,2 NOT NULLcode. On my MVC3 Application I already set culture for esES on the web.config file.

That would be perfect except for one thingp  pcodeThe field must be a numbercode validation is forcing me to use dot. as decimal separator instead of comma,. So, I dont know how to change it nor how to translate this error message. Then I thought I might force the user to use dot instead of comma with jquery uglysolution. So, I did it just to make some tests and the result was that it allowed me to pass the validations and created perfectly the object in database. p  pBut here comes the weird, when Im editting that same object, its shown on my same strongly typed form with comma as a decimal separator instead of dot. So whats the problem That the user cant never submit an edition of the object.p  pWhat am I doing wrongp  blockquote   ol   liAdded the proper collation to the database.li   liAdded the globalization attribute on the web.config file.li   liI even tried this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5199835mvc3jqueryvalidationglobalizingofnumberdecimalfieldMVC 3 jQuery Validationglobalizing of numberdecimal fielda   with no success...li   ol blockquote  pWhich is the proper way to do this p  pThanksp

Negative 62392 pMy question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4036398iphonecreateareusablecomponentcontrolthathassomeinterfacebuilderpiiPhone Create a reusable component control that has some Interface Builder pieces and some codea but it doesnt quite solve my problem.  Also, it is a year later now and who knows what has changed in the meantime.p  pIm developing an iPad app using Interface Builder and a storyboard.  I need the same date picker popover in a couple of places but I havent been able to figure out how to reuse the same component from different views.  I have spent a couple of hours on this, trying things out, reading docs, googling and stackoverflowing.p  pCurrently Ive have done a hack job that gets me the functionality but it isnt pretty.  What has been the most promising approach so far is to have a popover segue from a button to a new UIViewController which contains the date picker and some other widgets.  This shows the date picker popover when pressing the button and also animates the date picker away when pressing outside of it.p  pHowever, I cant figure out how to use this from multiple buttons.  I have tried delegates but Im screwing up somewhere.p

The same goes when I thought of just using an include but the staff would still need to be using FTP to make changes....p  pDoes anyone with some WebsiteBaker knowledge know how I can create a block of content in the backend and include it at the base of every page  Kind of like an attribute in Wordpressp

Negative 62392 pBasically, i have a program that is given a 4 meg compressed file, it has to decode this file into uncompressed  100 meg, then compress it back into 4 meg file. I need to store this intermediate 100 meg file somewhere on the drive dont want to keep it in memory.p  pProgram is written in C and will be executed on MS Windows 7. At the moment of uncompressing, no guaranteed folder with write access is given to the program folder with source file might be read only and folder with target file might be not yet specified.p  pThis has proven to be not an easy taskp  p1 I have read about a C function that creates a temp file that will disappear when closed or program is terminated. However, from what i understand it tries to make the file on disk C, in root directory, so this will obviously fail if user has no rights for that which normal user doesntp  p2 I had an idea to use environmentalsystem variable TEMP and create a file there, BUT looking on a random Win7 PC which wasnt tweaked, i see that this variable points to cwindowstemp, and that folder has specific rights for users  that is, they have rights to read, execute, create and write files, but not to delete them, check their attributes, etc. This means, i assume, that if program is ran with user privilleges, it will be able to make a file but not able to delete it, so the only way to delete it would be to open the file for writing and then close it, making it a 0 length file. This is also not desired, and i dont know how to query for system variables from Cp  p3 So, basically, only idea i have right now is to make a function to open file thatp  ul litries to create a temp file in the output dir, if possibleli liif failed, tries to create a temp file in input dirli liif failed, tries to create a temp file in TEMP dir from system variableli liif failed, tries to create a temp file in TMP dir from system variableli ul  pand a delete function thatp  ul litries to remove the file by its name that is stored somewhereli liif failed, it tries to open the file for write, and close it, so it becomes a 0 byte fileli ul  pAre there better ideas p  pAny help is appreciated, thanksp  pPS Program must not use any external libraries like MFC or something, only builtin standart C functions p

Negative 62392 pHopefully this isnt too difficult to follow.p  pIm currently working on a small timelogging application that runs quietly in the background. Every time the ticker runs down, the application prompts the user to say what heshe was doing since the last prompt. Ill eventually have the application write the data into a spreadsheet.p  pOne of the options I have so far enables the user to choose whether or not heshe would like to use the default prompting setting every time a prompt is missed, it stays visible until the next one is created, meaning if the user leaves hisher computer for a while there may be a fair few prompts sitting on the screen waiting to be filled in or would like to combine all the prompts every time a prompt is missed and a new one pops up, the old one is closed and the new one covers the time of the old prompt and the new prompt.p  pThe user can also select a tickbox to turn prompts off. When heshe turns prompts back on again, a prompt pops up asking the user to fill in what heshe was doing while prompts were turned off useful when the user is running fullscreen applications, etc.p  pMy problem is, when I try to generate the prompts, they dont display correctly. I cant manipulate them at all and none of the controls display. They basically look like empty forms.p  pHeres my code for generating prompts using the tickerp  precodepublic void tickerobject source, System.Timers.ElapsedEventArgs e              if groupMissed                      incrementsMissed  1             if incrementsMissed gt 1                              IncrementForm form  IncrementFormApplication.OpenForms[IncrementForm]                 if form.InvokeRequired                                      form.Invokenew MethodInvokerdelegate  form.Close                                                 else                      incrementsMissed  1                   IncrementForm theIncrementForm  new IncrementFormthis, e.SignalTime         theIncrementForm.Show         latestIncrement  e.SignalTime      codepre  pAnd heres my code for generating prompts using the turn prompts off checkboxp  precodeprivate void chkbxAlertsClickobject sender, EventArgs e              if chkbxAlerts.Checked                       Ensures that the time missed is covered and restarts the timer             DateTime now             now  DateTime.Now             if now  latestIncrement.TotalMinutes gt 1  Only records time if it is equal to or greater than one minute                               TODO FIX                 if groupMissed                                      incrementsMissed  1                     if incrementsMissed gt 1                                              IncrementForm form  IncrementFormApplication.OpenForms[IncrementForm]                         if form.InvokeRequired                                                      form.Invokenew MethodInvokerdelegate  form.Close                                                                                 else                                      incrementsMissed  1                                  IncrementForm theIncrementForm  new IncrementFormthis, now, latestIncrement                 theIncrementForm.Show                 latestIncrement  now                          timer.Enabled  true                  else                       Stops the timer             timer.Enabled  false               codepre  pIf you need any further clarification, please let me know.

Negative 62392 pI am writing a custom container class. A constituent object is created independently of the container, and can be a member of no container or multiple containers. The containers public API should support three operationsp  ul liiteration over all objectsli liinsertion of a new objectli liremoval of an existing objectli ul  pThe container does some additional work, and its precise implementation may change.p  pHow can I write the public API to this class so that it remains stable as I change the implementationp  pIf the container is codelistcodelike, efficient removal requires the knowledge of the objects index knowing the object itself is no good I dont want to search the whole container for the element.p  pIf the container is codesetcodelike, theres nothing equivalent to the index, and I need the object itself.p  pIf the container is like a singly linked list, I need some kind of a reference to the object preceding the object being removed.p  pIf the container is like a doubly linked list, I need a reference to the object itself.p  pI am thinking to have the removal method take a single argument codereferencecode, which has no meaning or use outside of the removal method. The iteration would yield a pair of codeobjectcode, codereferencecode.p  pIs there any problem with this design Is there an example or design pattern I can look upp  pIdeally, I would rather have the iteration yield a complex object that contains both the original codeobjectcode and the codereferencecode, and exhibits the interface of both.

Negative 62392 pBefore you answer use currentuser, which does work for many cases, or use user, which really doesnt work, please read the following...p  pI am attempting to create a view on a table which limits user access to certain rows within the table, controlled by the IP address from which the user connects.p  pMy first attempt looked like thisp  precodecreate table testtable    RowID bigint not null autoincrement,   owner varchar64,   key varchar64,   val varchar64,   primary key RowID  create view testview    RowID,   owner,   key,   val  as select   testtable.RowID as RowID,   testtable.owner as owner,   testtable.key as key,   testtable.val as val from testtable where testtable.owner  substringindexcurrentuser, , 1  create user testuser192.168.3.30 identified by testpass grant select, insert, update, delete on testview to testuser192.168.3.30 codepre  pNow the theory is that I should be able to log in as testuser from the host 192.168.3.30 and do something like codeselect  from testviewcode and get the proper subset of testtable that applies to me.p  pThe above does not work.  The reason it doesnt work is that codecurrentusercode returns the views emdefinerem by default, resulting in no data, or worse the wrong data, depending on who the definer was.  If I want codecurrentusercode to return the eminvokingem user, I need to create the view with a codeSQL SECURITY INVOKERcode clause, which also limits the security privileges to those of the invoking user, thus defeating the original purpose of the code.p  pI would love to use codeusercode, but unfortunately, that almost always returns the hostnamedomain instead of the IP address.p  pSide note, in case its not clear  Getting the IP address in PHP or Ruby, or perl, or whatever is not useful in this case.  Im setting up a bit of database security, so relying on the client is obviously inadequate.  I need the IP address in the SQL.p  pFor the curious looking for ideasreferencecontextp  pFor reference, I got the idea for this nifty security trick from a hrefhttpwww.sqlmaestro.comresourcesallrowlevelsecuritymysql relnofollowherea, but theyre using the username instead of the IP address, which would make this much easier.  In my case, Im trying to set up a database of hosts which is partially updated from the hosts themselves.  I dont want to set up a different user for each host, but I do want each host to be able to update its own records of filesystems, fan speeds, temperatures, and so on.p

Negative 62392 pTraditionally, I have built MVC applications using view models with Data Annotations attributes, and I dynamically render the views using editor templates.  Everything works great, and it really cuts down on the time it takes me to build new views.  My requirements have recently changed.  Now, I cant define the view model at design time.  The properties that will be rendered on the view are decided at run time based on business rules.  Also, the validation rules for those properties may be decided at run time as well.  A field that is not required in my domain model, may be required in my view based on business rules.  Also, the set of properties that will be rendered is not known until run time  User A may edit 6 properties from the model, while user B may edit 9 properties.p  pI am wondering if it is possible to create a model metadata provider that will supply my own metadata from business rules for an untyped view model like a collection of property names and values.  Has anyone solved this problemp

Im sure I had this issue when I originally deployed the application but I cannot remember what the solution is.

Negative 62392 pIm having a problem with the way SSRS handles long text in Textboxes inside a Tablix when the first Textbox is broken by a page break. Heres the simplified setupp  hr  ol liCreate a Tablix with a single cell.li liAdd a Rectangle to that cell.li liAdd 2 Textboxes to that Rectangle, one below the other.li liEnsure CanGrow  True for both Textboxes.li liAdd data to each Textbox such that each one contains multiple lines and the first contains enough lines to force some of its lines past the end of the page. It helps to set the Page height to something ridiculous like 1 inch for testing purposes.li ol  hr  pemIts necessary to preview the report in Print Layout mode or export it to PDFem to see that all the lines in the first Textbox print, but the second Textbox only prints the first line. Taking enough lines out of the first Textbox to avoid splitting it across a page will allow the second Textbox to print all of its lines.p  pAm I missing something Is there a way to get the Tablix to behave properly across page breaks Its the Tablix because moving the Rectangle and Textboxes outside of the Tablix fixes the problem. I dont see a CanGrow or similar property on the Rectangle or Tablix. A workaround is to put each Textbox into its own Tablix row, but thats not ideal in my situation.p

Suppose ifp  precodebyte b1  byte0x0F  byte b2  byte0xFF  byte b3  byte0xFF  int r  some operation in bytes b1, b2 and b3 codepre  pThen r should be code0x000FFFFFcode. Byte b1 will be placed at higher 3rd position and byte b3 will be placed at lower 1st position in int value. Also my b1 will range from 0x00 to 0x0F and other bytes will be from code0x00code to code0xFFcode, assuming unsigned nature of bytes. If byte b1 is greater than 0x0F, I will extract only lowermost 4 bits. In short I want to extract int from 3 bytes but using only 20 bits of 3 bytes. total 16 bits from b2 and b3, and 4 lowermost bits from b1. int r must be positive as we are creating from 3 bytes and assuming unsigned nature of bytes.pli ol
Negative 62392 pI have a WordPress network installed locally and use MAMP Pro to run a server. I would like to view all the sites from another computer or device in the same LAN.p  pIs there a clean and simple way to do thisp  pI have MAMP setup so that it goes the a folder called Sites. In that folder each project has its own folder. Some projects are just simple HTML and CSS. I can view them just fine from my iPad. One project is a WordPress installation, and I cant load that folder. My guess is its something about MySQL and a different IP trying to access it.p

This is just one method for the client to guess where to connect, its not completely dependent on it.p  pThe server can be installed on many different environments though, so I dont know which interfaceaddress will be used to communicate with the client. Therefore, to tell the client where it is, Im compiling all the available ip addresses in the server and sending them all back in a multicast, so that the client can try them out until one succeeds.p  pMy question Is there a way to improve this mechanism I wonder if, on the server app, I could get the local ip that received the multicast from the client, then Id know which one to send back. Cant find methods that do that though. Maybe some way to attempt a connection to the client just to know which local address it would pick to do sop

Negative 62392 pIn Java Card Im interested in Classic downto 2.1.1, transient RAM needed by an applet is  typically allocated on install by codemakeTransientByteArraycode. That method accepts a parameter codeCLEARONRESETcode or codeCLEARONDESELECTcode. The later comes with warning thatp  blockquote   pcodeCLEARONDESELECTcode transient objects can be accessed only when the applet which created the object is in the same context as the currently selected applet.p      pThe Java Card runtime environment will throw a SecurityException if a codeCLEARONDESELECTcode transient object is accessed when the currently selected applet is not in the same context as the applet which created the object.p blockquote  pMy reading is that codeCLEARONDESELECTcode but not codeCLEARONRESETcode would allow the runtime to overlay the transients allocated on install as stated above between two applets, as long as they are not simultaneously selected, so that several applets allocating emmemsubjsub bytes would consume about maxemmemsubjsub transient bytes, rather than sumemmemsubjsub.p  pUpdate Im told something on the tune that on at least some runtime environments, the overlay occurs selectively for transients allocated from different packages. But I fail to find a reference, or a precise description of such rulemechanism.p  pQuestion Is this overlay mechanism sometime implemented in the runtime If yes, when does it occurs And are there cards with a runtime emnotem implementing it If yes, is there a way to tell other than by experiment, maybe from the version of Java Card advertisedp  pOther question Precisely what does context mean in the quoted restriction In particular, is a codeCLEARONDESELECTcode transient usable by another instance of the applet, sharing it with the instance that allocated by the mechanism shown a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14257052903600herea Note Im not interested in sharing the content of the transient, only in avoiding two allocations, to workaround a possible lack of overlay by the runtime.p  pUpdate I asked the same question a hrefhttpsforums.oracle.comforumsthread.jspamessageID10795498 relnofollowherea and got an interesting answer.p

Negative 62392 pI have tried this double for loop that doesnt work. See below.p  pBasically, I have a list of constructs, and a list of primers. The primers are associated with the constructs by means of a construct number and a part number. Each construct is composed of multiple parts. For each part, there is a forward and a reverse primer. For the molecular biologyinclined SO members out there, Im basically writing a script to help me with PCRs. p  pWhat Im trying to do is this I want to search the list of primers for those primers that should be associated with the constructs part, and join them together into one master list. For example, if I have a list with EMP792 fw and EMP793 re inside it they are on separate lines, and they are associated with construct 1s part 2 in my construct list, I want to be able to search the primerslist for the corresponding fw and re primers. If the constructs part does not have associated primers inside the list, I want to skip past those constructs first.p  pThe strategy I used is this I did a nested for loop. For each construct in the construct list, I wanted it to search through the primer list for the fw and re primers. I know this is inefficient, but as a beginner programmer, thats the only way I could come up with. I included some conditionals to check whether a primer existed for those constructs, by checking the construct number and part number associated with the primers.p  pThe problem Im facing is this For each construct in the list, the loop doesnt search the entire primerlist. It seems to automatically jump past all primers previously compared, and only compare the next primer not yet compared. Thats causing problems in the processing, in which if you run the code with the associated data sets which I have also pasted below the code, you will find that a construct that should have an associated primer printed out doesnt have its associated primer, and its causing me much headaches trying to figure out whats going wrong lol, haha...p  pId appreciate any help pleasep  pCODEp

Negative 62392 pThroghout learning how to program Stack Overflow has provided a wealth of information, and a staple of learning how to figure out different things. However for this problem, after searching for a few days and coming up empty handed Ive decided to create my first post. p  pThe problem, creating a mulit line value in an XML file from a java string using Xpaths Node.setTextContent. Its writing to a value tag in the XML file that Xpath reports as an element node. Now when writing the string value to the node, it does indeed write the string value to the node, however its just one long string value, as the setTextContent method according to the API does not parse any thing in the string and just writes the text. An example of the data Im trying to write isedited 216, just noticed the format option wasnt showing the main post formated like below with the street, city state and phone broken down like the info below with out the spaces in between the lines to match the format as listed in the first the xml code example.p  p496 Vivid Ave.p  pSome City, State, 11111p  p1112223333p  pWhen the java string is wrote to xml file its entered as 496 Vivid Ave. Some City, State, 11111 1112223333p  pAn example of the node created from the parent program not my java app is p  precodeltfield sidADDRESSgt      ltitemlocationgt         ltaegt            ltaegtabsoluteltaegt            ltaegt33ltaegt            ltaegt168ltaegt         ltaegt      ltitemlocationgt      ltvaluegt496 Vivid Ave. Some City, State, 11111 1112223333ltvaluegt      ltborderwidthgt0ltborderwidthgt      ltfontinfogt         ltaegtTimes New Romanltaegt         ltaegt10ltaegt         ltaegtplainltaegt      ltfontinfogt      ltscrollhorizgtwordwrapltscrollhorizgt      ltscrollvertgtfixedltscrollvertgt      ltformatgt         ltaegtstringltaegt         ltaegtoptionalltaegt      ltformatgt      ltacclabelgt6.  leave address. enter street, city, state, zip code and phone number. ltacclabelgt      ltsizegt         ltaegt35ltaegt         ltaegt3ltaegt      ltsizegt      ltpreviousgtFIELD5ltpreviousgt      ltnextgtORDINARYltnextgt   ltfieldgt codepre  pWhen i run my app the ouput of raw xml data looks like thisp  precodeltfield sidADDRESSgt      ltitemlocationgt         ltaegt            ltaegtabsoluteltaegt            ltaegt33ltaegt            ltaegt168ltaegt         ltaegt      ltitemlocationgt      ltvaluegt496 Vivid Ave. Some City, State, 11111 1112223333ltvaluegt      ltborderwidthgt0ltborderwidthgt      ltfontinfogt         ltaegtTimes New Romanltaegt         ltaegt10ltaegt         ltaegtplainltaegt      ltfontinfogt      ltscrollhorizgtwordwrapltscrollhorizgt      ltscrollvertgtfixedltscrollvertgt      ltformatgt         ltaegtstringltaegt         ltaegtoptionalltaegt      ltformatgt      ltacclabelgt6.  leave address. enter street, city, state, zip code and phone number. ltacclabelgt      ltsizegt         ltaegt35ltaegt         ltaegt3ltaegt      ltsizegt      ltpreviousgtFIELD5ltpreviousgt      ltnextgtORDINARYltnextgt   ltfieldgt codepre  pI have tried to manually enter the escaped characters for line feed and carriage return in the string , and all it does is prting the code values, not the value.p  pAs the parent program reads my Java code it does not break down the address and phone number on separate lines.p  pThe java im using looks likep  precodepublic void setFieldValueString sid, String value     Node resultNode  null     XPath xPath  XPathFactory.newInstance.newXPath      try          resultNode  NodexPath.evaluatemakeFieldStringsid, doc,XPathConstants.NODE      catchXPathExpressionException xpeeSystem.out.printlnxpee  Could not retrive node      if resultNode  null          resultNode.setTextContentvalue           else System.out.printlnEpic fail        public String makeFieldStringString sid     String outputnull     if sid.equalsPOPUP2         outputpopup[sid  sid  ]value           else        output  field[sid  sid  ]value          return output  codepre  pIf anyone has any ideas on how to get the Java string to include line breaks that the setTextContent will recognize I would appreaciate it.

Negative 62392 pQuestion Ap  pGiven the code below, I understand that when you call a fork, most if its resources are passed  over to the child process. Now just about every Fork example I have looked up is set up like the one I have.

Negative 62392 pI need to implement version control for the project I am currently working on. p  pI have a Windows XP SP2 VM which is where I should set the server, which would be accessed by another Windows XP machine.p  pMy question is, how do I set the serverp  pI know that the best choice would be to actually ditch XP for the server and just install Linux on a VM and run gitolite or anything of that sort, but since the likeliness of that happening is extremely low, what are my options herep  pGitstack failed on me since XP is not supported according to their page. I get a DLL error when starting gitstack.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 62392 pThere have been many posts where someone needed to know how to change the permissions of a folder or file upon installation using VBScript.  The one problem that I have is that none of them have solved it for nonEnglish situations.  p  pThis is basically what I have so far.  I check to see if the locale is a specific language like fr for French and then assume that there is a group called Utilisateurs for the Users group.  I then call cacls to set the change permission on my folder.  This works quite well for English and French, but I dont know for sure what the groups are for the other languages.  I am currently limited to only these six because I dont know what the other Users groups are named for the other languages.  p  pI would like to be able to handle all cases, but if you have a list of known Users groups for other languages that would be sufficient for me to solve my current problem. p  precodeDim nLocale nLocale  objShell.RegReadHKEYUSERS.DEFAULTControl PanelInternationalLocaleName Dim nLocaleName, sUserGroup nLocaleName  LeftnLocale, 2 MsgBox [ amp nLocaleName amp ]  en amp InStr1, nLocalName, en, vbTextCompare if InStr1, nLocaleName, en, vbTextCompare  1 or nLocaleNameen then     sUserGroupUsers elseif InStr1, nLocaleName, fr, vbTextCompare  1 then     sUserGroupUtilisateurs elseif InStr1, nLocaleName, de, vbTextCompare  1 then     sUserGroupBenutzer elseif InStr1, nLocaleName, es, vbTextCompare  1 then     sUserGroupUsuarios elseif InStr1, nLocaleName, it, vbTextCompare  1 then     sUserGroupUtenti elseif InStr1, nLocaleName, pt, vbTextCompare  1 then     sUserGroupUsurios else     MsgBox To allow other users access to the AUDit Database you will need to give user permissions to  amp strHomeFolder, vbOKOnly  vbExclamation, Notice of Permissions     return end if  Wscript.Echo cacls  amp strHomeFolder amp  e c g  amp sUserGroup amp C   intRunError  objShell.Runcacls  amp strHomeFolder amp  e c G  amp sUserGroup amp C , 2, True codepre  pThis works when I run it and when it is set in a Custom Action using Visual Studios Setup Wizard.

Negative 62392 pBelow is an example of what Im trying to achieve in means of HTML code. I quickly wrote this up to give an example.p  precodeltbodygt    ltdiv iddirectorycontainergt      lta classdirectory hrefhomegtHome ltagt      lta classdirectory hrefhomemarketplacegtMarketplace ltagt      lta classdirectory hrefhomemarketplacemajorproductsgtMajor Productsltagt    ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pA good example is a file directory lets say youre in the C Drive and then navigate your way to the following directory.p  pCProgram FilesJavajre7binp  pAs you can the see the computer understands where you are currently and the previous file urls you had to visit in order to get to this directory. I have the ability to click on any of those 5 locations and instantly relocate to that directory.p  pThis is what I would like on my website, but I feel that manually doing this with the above example can prove tedious and unmanageable if the website is to grow and really increase with 500 pages and thats a minor value. Which is why Im asking if there is some automated way to provide this feature so I wont have to go through this if for some reason the URLs on the website change or the path files change etc.. Im starting to believe this doesnt readily exist, but I could be wrong and is why Im asking this.p  pIm willing to do PHP, but would prefer only HTMLCSS which Im going to assume is impossible since you would need the information from the server regardless. I also would like to stay away from JavaScript  Plugins.p  pI hope Ive worded this better if there are any other concerns on what Im requesting I can supply more information and possibly examples. A good example is GitHub and how you have an online navigation of your file storage. I basically want the same for a website only instead of it working exactly how the windows folders work. I want it to be more like each URL is linked to a given Name and I can perform a navigation based off that if possible.p  pHeres are much better examples of a website that uses the idea Im wanting. So as you can see Im looking at a better means of making this work instead of manually doing it all.p  pa hrefhttpservices.runescape.commrswikienMediumQuests relnofollowhttpservices.runescape.commrswikienMediumQuestsa a hrefhttpsgithub.comgitgittreemastergitremotehelpersgit relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgitgittreemastergitremotehelpersgitap  pYoull see that they both supply these navigation menus Ill try finding more if my question still isnt understandable.p

This means it is no longer possible for us to use this concatenation method as each of our stacks require subnets that span more than 255 addresses in total.p  pId like to generate the CIDR blocks onthefly rather than having to define them as parameters to the CloudFormation template, p  pOne idea I had was each stack having a base integer and adding to that for each subnets CIDR block.p  pFor examplep  precode    CidrBlock   FnJoin  [ ., [  Ref  VpcCidrPrefix ,  FnSum, [  Ref  VpcCidrStart , 3 ] , 024 ] ]  codepre  pWhere codeVpcCidrStartcode is an integer that sets the value that the third CIDR octet should start from within the script, and code3code is the subnet number.p  pObviously the codeFnSumcode intrinsic function doesnt exist though, so I wanted to know if anyone had a solution to adding integers in VPC it seems like something that shouldnt be possible, as CloudFormation is string oriented, or a better solution to this conundrum in general.p

Negative 62392 pBefore my question i need to explain how our system works. We have one system that basicaly works with the following structurep  pSitep  pArtist Areap  ul liAll artists are our partners.li liHere they can upload their songs and edit information about it.li ul  pCustomer Areap  ul liPaying monthly value and he will be able to add 30 audiosmonth to his library.li liIts possible to listen to audios by online player.li ul  pNow we want to implement one app that basicaly is one simple player. With playlist and sorting audios by artistname. User will only see songs that he bought and added to his playlisl on website. All process of payments can be or cannot be functional inside the app. And this player will work with our song data added by Artist. Note that audios are dynamically added by artists in our web site.p  pMy question is Is there anyway to do one app like this If not, is there any alternative  p  pThanks in advance, and sorry about any english grammar mistake.p

Negative 62392 pIve managed to get highlight working on my force directed graph, with help of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma87802772302821this tutorial from Mike Bostocka. Now for further procedure in my idea and needs of my graph, Im little bit stuck, firstly because Im still nooby about d3js and second, I did non find anything similar yet.p  pTo clear out what my intentions, you can see current graph with highlighting on following link a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net2FwSY relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net2FwSYap  pIt works nicely, but my idea is little bit advanced. I was wondering if it is possible to tweak the highlighting in such way that on mouseover to node, it would highlight the links of that node to neighbour nodes, neighbour nodes and also links from that neighbouring nodes to their neighbour nodes.p  pPrecisely, on my jsfiddle example. If you hover codeBNGcode , codeBNGcode, codeYHOcode, codeCEOcode and all codelinks between themcode gets highlighted. The problem are that little one blue nodes which Im using as connection between bigger nodes, my highlight for now gets cutted on them because they are nodes in fact . Also it seems to me that there would be needed a codeIFcode statement which would tell if the hovered node is that little one or bigger, because I wanna that higllight on that little one connection nodes is working as if it works now..p  pI dont know from where to start from, so any suggestion or advice is welcome...p  pfull script looks like thisp  precodevar data  nodes[

Negative 62392 pIve encountered something that I cant explain while working with Eclipse today. p  pBasically, when I try to debug a function that writes to stdout just before ending, Eclipse will not return from the function and will stop debugging there.  The function may do other things as long as it writes to stdout last.p  pA program that causes the unexpected behaviour would be, for examplep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  void testfuncvoid      putsI hate you     int mainvoid      testfunc      printfso, so much.     return 3  codepre  pIn this case, it also shows some strange memory locations in the stack trace.p  pprintf causes the same behaviour as well. Its remarkable to mention that this doesnt happen when I step over the function, only when I trace into it, which would appear to point to a problem that is not from the code I showed.p  pChanging the function top  precodevoid testfuncvoid      int a     a3     putsI hate you    codepre  pGets a SIGSEGV signal sent to the process, whilep  precodevoid testfuncvoid      int a      putsI hate you      a3  codepre  pWorks without problems.p  pAs I said, stepping over the function or just running the program not debugging works fine, as does compiling manually with gcc and running the program on a terminal.p  pIm running Fedora 19, and Eclipse is Version 4.3.1, Build id 5fc19p  pAny ideasp

Negative 62392 pIm looking for a way to unit test my a C application linked into an executable. Im using googletest and I need to link the test executable to the binary under test in order to test that binary. The binary under test is an executable in my case. On Windows I can create an import library for the tested executable and link the test executable with it. As long as I dont export the main function from the tested binary, it works fine.  However on Linux Im not able to do this. When linking directly with the tested executable, linkage fails since there are two main functions, one in the tested executable and one in the test executable. And Im not aware of any way to create an import library on Linux and to link with it.p  pI understand that I can divide my tested executable into a shared library with all the functionality in it and a small executable with only the main function in it. The test program would link with the shared library. But thats something I would really prefer not doing, since I have more than 20 of these executables that I need to test and dividing each of them into a shared library and an executable would take too long from number of reasons.p  pAnother possibility would be to add the tested source code into the test project, but then the tested source code would be compiled twice, which I cant afford because of long build times.p  pSo Im trying to figure out if it is possible to do on Linux something similar to what Ive done on Windows.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 62392 pI am trying to create a web server using a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagehappstackservertls relnofollowhappstackservertlsa that will use a certificate signed by a private CA.  Unfortunately, the TLS handshake only seems to succeed if I give the server a selfsigned certificate.  Wireshark shows that when my server is using a certificate signed by my private CA, instead of sending the client a Server Hello message, it sends a Fatal 2 Alert message reporting Handshake Failure 40.p  pThis is not a case of the web browser rejecting the servers certificate Wireshark shows that the TLS handshake never even gets to the point where the server presents a certificate to the browser.  Nor is it a case of failure to agree on cryptographic algorithms, since the server runs without problems using a selfsigned certificate that uses the same algorithm as the one I want to use.  The certificate itself seems valid, since it works as expected using codeopenssl sservercode on the command line, and happstackservertls appears to use OpenSSL for TLS operations, so I dont think its a problem with how the certificate is generated.p  pWhat do I need to do to get happstackservertls to work with a nonselfsigned certificatep  pThe following is a minimal Haskell program that uses happstackservertls to run a web server on port 8443 that demonstrates the problem.  It takes up to three arguments the file containing the servers private key, the file containing the servers certificate, and optionally the file containing the CAs certificate.p  precodemodule Main  main  where  import Happstack.Server.Response ok import Happstack.Server.SimpleHTTPS TLSConf .., nullTLSConf, simpleHTTPS import System.Environment getArgs  main  IO  main  do args lt getArgs           case args of             [keyFile, certFile]         gt runServer keyFile certFile Nothing             [keyFile, certFile, caFile] gt runServer keyFile certFile Just caFile  runServer  FilePath gt FilePath gt Maybe FilePath gt IO  runServer keyFile certFile caFile  simpleHTTPS conf  ok      where conf  nullTLSConf  tlsPort  8443                              , tlsCert  certFile                              , tlsKey   keyFile                              , tlsCA    caFile                               codepre  pThe above program works using a selfsigned certificate generated via the following scriptp  precode binsh  openssl ecparam name secp384r1 genkey out selfsigned.key openssl req new x509 days 365 key selfsigned.key out selfsigned.crt codepre  pAnd running the following commandp  precoderunghc Main.hs selfsigned.key selfsigned.crt codepre  pIt works in that a web browser can connect to the server successfully albeit complaining about a selfsigned certificate, as expected.p  pHowever, it doesnt work using a nonselfsigned certificate generated by the following script, which first creates a new private CA and then uses that CA to generate the certificate for the serverp  precode binsh  rm rf ca mkdir ca mkdir canewcerts mkdir caprivate touch caindex.txt echo 100001 gtcaserial  openssl ecparam name secp384r1 genkey out caprivatecakey.pem openssl req new x509 days 365 key caprivatecakey.pem out cacacert.pem  openssl ecparam name secp384r1 genkey out onelevelserver.key openssl req new days 365 key onelevelserver.key out onelevelserver.req openssl ca config onelevel.openssl.cnf in onelevelserver.req out onelevelserver.crt codepre  pWhen I run the following commandp  precoderunghc Main.hs onelevelserver.key onelevelserver.crt cacacert.pem codepre  pWeb browsers cant connect because as shown by Wireshark the initial TLS handshake fails.p  pHowever, a web browser emcanem establish a TLS connecting when using codeopensslcode to act as a server using the same certificatep  precodeopenssl sserver accept 8443 key onelevelserver.key cert onelevelserver.crt CAfile cacacert.pem codepre  pTo complete the example, here is the configuration file codeonelevel.openssl.cnfcode referenced earlier that provides the configuration for the private CAp  precode[ ca ] defaultca  CAonelevel  [ CAonelevel ]  dir               .ca certs             dircerts crldir           dircrl database          dirindex.txt newcertsdir     dirnewcerts  certificate       dircacert.pem serial            dirserial crlnumber         dircrlnumber  crl               dircrl.pem privatekey       dirprivatecakey.pem  x509extensions   onelevelcert  nameopt          cadefault certopt          cadefault  defaultdays      365 defaultcrldays  30 defaultmd        default preserve          no  policy            policymatch  [ policymatch ]  countryName             match stateOrProvinceName     match organizationName        match organizationalUnitName  match commonName              supplied emailAddress            optional  [ onelevelcert ]  basicConstraintsCAFALSE keyUsagedigitalSignature,keyEncipherment extendedKeyUsageserverAuth  subjectKeyIdentifierhash authorityKeyIdentifierkeyid,issuer codepre

I changed that top  precodedocument.pageinitfunction  ...  codepre  pThis worked fine on one of my dev machines OS X as well as on mobile.

Negative 62392 pIve searched the board, as well as the oculus board, and unity board. Couldnt really find something that helped. p  pIm working on a vehicle simulation. Before we started using the oculus, it was just a regular first person perspective. You used a racing wheelpedals to drive and the mouse to control all the buttons and switches etc. We use raycasting from the mouse point on the screen into the world to interact with the various controls in the vehicle. p  pNow that were using the oculus, the raycast isnt taking into account the distortion matrix used on the oculus cameras. So youre not actually casting a ray at what youre visually clicking on. Using Debug.DrawRay I found that it was slightly off. Just to be sure, I disabled the lens correction via inspector on the OVRCameraController and sure enough the raycasting was working again.p  pThe ray itself is calculated the usual way one does when firing from the mouse point  ScreenPointToRayInput.mousePositionp  pWould anyone have any idea how I can adjust my ray so it works with lens correction onp  pCheers, Gordonp

Negative 62392 pIm migrating an old Java application, originally written for Oracle Application Server, to WebLogic 10.3.6 in Oracle Fusion Middleware.

For my application I have to use a text file which I have decided to acces from the internal storage using the following codep  precodeString functFileName  nameOfMyFile OutputStream output  openFileOutputfunctFileName, Context.MODEAPPEND codepre  pAs far as i understood, this means that my application creates a file with the name nameOfMyFile.txt in the internal storage memory, or opens it, if it already exists. Once the file has been created, it will remain stored until the app is deleted. Please correct me if I got it wrongp  pMy question is Is it possible, that a file with that name has already been created by another application, which in this case would ruin my programm In other words Can I be sure that my app doesnt access another file, which accidentally has the same name, than creating one of itselfp  pSorry if this question isnt very professional. Id be grateful for any help.p

In that moment the wheel start to rotate and the player object should stay over the wheel while running. The problem is that the friction makes the player fall.

Negative 62392 pI have used UniDac VCL components for Delphi for a year now but recently started quite a big project with SQL Server 2012 and I want to separate the tables and stored procedures in different schemes my whole logic is in stored procedures so no querys in the program only the stored procedure names and parameters.p  pThe problem is that when I change my stored procedure schema from codedbocode to lets say codeSchemaAcode and then try to run it from Delphi the codeTUniStoredProccode component finds it as codeProcedureNamecode and not as codeSchemaA.ProcedureNamecode which throws the exception of not finding the stored procedure on execute.p  pI cant assign different schemas to different users as their default schemes because there are users that use from 46 schemes depending on the permissions. What I tried already is manually entering codeSchemaA.ProcedureNamecode and that works perfectly but doing so for 150 components would take a lot of time so Im searching for a better solution.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 62392 pI am making a battleships game for my coursework, and I have run into some problems with the get functions in one of the classes I am using. The basic idea of my game is to create a 2D 10X10 array, called grid, filled with null pointers to represent the board. I have created 2 classes, Board and Ship. The grid array is of type Ship, and I use an algorithm to fill the array with Ships randomly. I use the Board class to access the grid array and the hits array which I use to track hits.p  pHowever I cannot figure out how the getShips function can return the grid array. The hits array is just booleans so that was easy enough, but I am not proficient enough at C to make the getShips function properly return the grid array, which is a Ship pointer type. I would greatly appreciate any help.p  precodeclass Board       private      Ship grid[10][10]      bool hits[10][10]      public       get functions      Ship getShips           return grid            bool getHits          return hits       codepre  pI was also wondering if it would be possible to manipulate the array in other functions by calling the codegetShipscode function. Something likep  precodefor int x0 xlt10 x         for int y0 ylt10 y              board.getShips[x][y]nullptr                 codepre
Negative 62392 pI made one android application that needs to connect one local database provided by wamp server. First using the android virtual device AVD my IP to connect the server first time used to be code10.0.2.2code. My AVD was connecting fine, but when I tried to connect direct on my device he wasnt finding the local server with this code10.0.2.2code IP. At this point Ive changed IP to code192.168.1.5code which was my LAN cable IP, both device and AVD were running without problems... but sometimes I need to change my connection to wifi, which changes the IP..also, I realized that fix one IP in my source code will be a problem to release the android app, since other people will have other LAN IP address.p  pTo solve this problem, Ive started to look for a solution, such as acquire the LAN IP dynamically. For this purpose I built this Java application as testp  precodepublic class test      public static void mainString[] args throws Exception              String roundHost  null         EnumerationltNetworkInterfacegt n  NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces         for  n.hasMoreElements                      NetworkInterface e  n.nextElement              EnumerationltInetAddressgt a  e.getInetAddresses             for  a.hasMoreElements                              InetAddress addr  a.nextElement                 if addr.isSiteLocalAddress                     String pureHost  addr.getByNameaddr.getHostName.toString                     roundHost  addr.getHostAddress                     pureHost  pureHost.substringaddr.getHostName.length1                      ifroundHost.equalspureHost                         break                                                System.out.printlnroundHost       codepre  pAs output, this java application gives me my correct LAN wifi IP or even my LAN cable IP which is code192.168.1.3code or code192.168.1.7code. From here I made one IPParser to use on my android appp  precodepublic class IPParser       String pureHost, roundHost  null      public IPParser throws UnknownHostException          EnumerationltNetworkInterfacegt n  null         try              n  NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces          catch SocketException e1              e1.printStackTrace                  for  n.hasMoreElements                      NetworkInterface e  n.nextElement              EnumerationltInetAddressgt a  e.getInetAddresses             for  a.hasMoreElements                              InetAddress addr  a.nextElement                 if addr.isSiteLocalAddress                     pureHost  addr.getByNameaddr.getHostName.toString                     roundHost  addr.getHostAddress                     pureHost  pureHost.substringaddr.getHostName.length1                      ifroundHost.equalspureHost                         break                                                    public String returnIp           return roundHost        codepre  pAs you can see its pretty similar the difference is just some structural changes to adapt the needed syntax. And now comes the real problem When I try to run this parser inside my AVD, my ip is code10.0.2.15code and running directly in my device the ip return is code192.168.1.6code  Obviously the android app is crashing because it cant find the local server to connect. p  pMy IP config information img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6dXjZ.png altMy IP config informationp  pIm not an expert in network, so I ask, take it easy and if I said something technically wrong or adjacents please edit and correct me..finally I askp  pWhy this is happening and whats possible to do to solve this problemp

Eventually main thread will join those result and return from the function. p  pOn the other hand, if I were to choose the threadpoolexecutor, my understanding is that a thread is chosen from the thread pool, this selected thread will do the work, then go back to the thread pool to listen to more work to do.

My code also includes all the needed vendor prefixes. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcmvLm.png altp  pThis is how it looks on Firefox and mobile it maintains its original darkish color it looks even worse when I hover itp  pThank you very much for your help Have a nice dayp  pEDIT Someone requested that I add a fiddle  if you run it in Chrome and in Firefox, you will get different results for the color even IE11 gets it right this time a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net3UN3E1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net3UN3E1ap

Negative 62392 pIm currently working on a project in a team of more than 2 people. Each person on the team has varying levels of skill and knowledge with .NET, particularly the asyncawait keywords for asynchronous programming in C 5. I personally have learned much about this paradigm and am familiar with some of the intricacies and gotchas of it, but some of the team are not. Has anybody out there come up with a good convention for annotating  attributing code that returns async Task  async void to indicate whether the result of the call must be awaited or whether it can be left to run fire and forget in the background  The project has a lot of heavy over usage of asynchronous programming. Were working on improving performance at the moment, and theres a lot of instances where the results of functions are async Task that are not awaited and left as fireforget, and async void where the result should really be a task that gets awaited. I should think that the answer to this should be obvious based on return type, but its not obvious to everyone on the team.p

SystemF is polymorphic, has function returning type, which may make in some way think about SMLs functors, but SystemF according to something I have read, cannot typecheck infinite recursion, while this can be easily achieved with SMLp  precodefun r x int  r x int    Typechecks  val y  r 0                  Infinite loop  codepre  pSo if SMLs type system is neither simplytyped neither SystemF, what is itformally Or I am wrong and its one of bothp
Negative 62392 pI have an android app which is fully functional. Right now, I have a main activity that works as a menuhome screen from which you can go to different sections of the app. For the new version, I would like to redesign the navigation so that these options are always available in the form of a tab bar like this keeping the action bar as it isp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfeMQ1.png altenter image description herep  pI havent worked with these before, but from what I have read, it doesnt seem complicated. The problem is that I already have a whole bunch of activities that are used to working the other way. I recall reading something about changing codeActivitycode classes to codeTabActivitycode. This is something I would strongly want to avoid, because I have a considerable depth of inheritance as I have grouped similar functionalities in different base abstract classes which in the end extend codeActivitycode. p  pWhat I would like to know is your advice on what would be the most efficient or simplest way to make this change, while breaking as little as possible features of the app. Is there a way I can simply switch the activity being shown as the selected tab changes How would you restructure the applicationp  pAny help will be appreciated and I can give you more information if needed. Thanksp

It actually acts as 5 of the page height, which pushes it down much further than intended.p  pIm probably missing some quirk of HTMLCSS, because Im still relatively new to this, so any help would be appreciated.p  pThanks in advance p  pedit I now understand that the problem lies on certain parent elements not having static dimensions, however is there a way to avoid this but still have relative heightswidths on child elements It would seem silly to define the body with a static heightwidth, which would just seriously limit the sites accessibility on devices with other dimensions.p  pRelevant CSS code for outer bear in mind I just used outerinner as examples, and below is the actual code Ive been usingp  precode.logincenterpanel     width50    height30    backgroundcolor3D3D3D    marginleftauto    marginrightauto    floattop    bordertopleftradius 15px    bordertoprightradius 15px    borderbottomleftradius 15px    borderbottomrightradius 15px    fontfamily Verdana, Arial, sansserrif    colorwhite    padding1px  codepre  pand below is the relevant css for innerp  precodesigninGreetText     margintop5  codepre  pThe margintop property of signinGreetText still acts as 5 of the whole page, and not as 5 of the height of logincenterpanelp
Negative 62392 pIm working on an existing code base, written in C, which is being compiled using GCC for an arm7tdmi target.  This is embedded code, which runs without an operating system on the target system.p  pThe issue that Im running into is that the code is using the fantastic a hrefhttpwww.sparetimelabs.comtinyprintftinyprintf.php relnofollowGPLd embedded printf library, written by Kustaa Nyholma, which uses stdarg.h for variable length arguments.  Without going into too many details, this is causing errors with a commercial preprocessing tool which I need to use.p  pThis is basically the tinyprintf headerp  precodeinclude ltstdarg.hgt  void initprintfvoid putp,void putf void,char void tfpprintfchar fmt, ... void tfpsprintfchar s,char fmt, ... void tfpformatvoid putp,void putf void,char,char fmt, valist va codepre  pOf course, the way the sprintfprintf work they need to have variable arguments.  What Im wondering is if there is a way to implement this without using stdharg.h and valist.  Or maybe more to the point, if there is a way to implement variadic arguments in C without requiring stdarg.h.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15216260variablelengthargumentswithoutusingstdarghThis solutiona wont work for me, as I am using an ARM target.  In the arm7 calling convention the first four parameters are passed in registers.  Additionally, I need my code to be fairly portable.p  pI dont know of a way to do this, but maybe the internet has an idea.p

Negative 62392 pI have an ElasticBeanstalk setup using Amazons Docker AMI. I have just started experimenting with setting up a new environment within my EB Application. It is running as Webserver with Docker.p  pWhat I am trying to do with this environment is have Docker daemon running that is running on TCP rather than a Unix socket. That works by modifying codeetcsysconfdockercode and adding the codeHcode flag. Unfortunately, that breaks that EB deployment scripts because they are expecting the Docker daemon on the default Unix socket.p  pI have tried to add a codeetcprofiledocker.shcode which contains the appropriate codeDOCKERHOSTcode variable. However, it doesnt seem to be picked up by the EB deployment scripts.p  pDid anyone try something similar Where can I globally set the codeDOCKERHOSTcode so it gets picked up by the EB deploymentp  pI appreciate any hints and suggestions.p

Negative 62392 pI am using Jackson to interpret JSON responses from an API that I am writing. I would like, as a standard throughout my API, to throw errors from the API to the program with something likep  precodeerrorMessageNo such username. codepre  pSo I want my response processor to first check if the response is just a single errorMessage key, and if  so to handle the error, and if not, then to interpret it as whatever response it was expecting from that command.p  pSo heres my codep  precodepublic class ProcessingException extends Exception      private String errorMessage     public ProcessingException      public String getErrorMessage          return errorMessage           public void setErrorMessageString errorMessage          this.errorMessage  errorMessage        codepre  pand then, in my response handlerp  precodeOverride public void useResponseInputStream in throws IOException, ProcessingException       turn response into a string     java.util.Scanner s  new java.util.Scannerin.useDelimiterA     String response  s.hasNext  s.next        ProcessingException exception     try           Attempt to interpret as an exception         exception  mapper.readValueresponse, ProcessingException.class          catchIOException e           Otherwise interpret it as expected. responseType is an abstract TypeReference          which is filled in by subclasses. useResponse is also abstract. Each subclass          represents a different kind of request.         Object responseObj  mapper.readValueresponse, responseType         useResponseresponseObj         return           I needed this out of the trycatch clause because listener.errorResponse might      actually choose to throw the passed exception to be dealt with by a higher      authority.     if listenernull listener.errorResponseexception  codepre  pThis works beautifully, except under one circumstance  there are some requests that actually dont need to respond with anything, so they return codecode. For some reason, this response completely runs through the codeexception  mapper.readValueresponse, ProcessingException.classcode line without triggering an IOException, so the program things that there is an error. But then when it tries to read what the error was, it throws a codeNullPointerExceptioncode when trying to read codeexception.getErrorMessagecode, because of course there is no error.p  pWhy is it treating codecode as a valid codeProcessingExceptioncode objectp

Negative 62392 pI have a requirement to write Big Data processing application using either Hadoop or Spark. I understand that Hadoop MapReduce is best technology for batch processing application while Spark is best technology for analytic application.  Application will get a input file and few configuration file. This input file need to be transformed to a output file with help of config files. Config file or transformation specification as we call has information like mapping from source to target file column wise and expression to transform  particular cell value to other value. I have written this already with MapReduce. Input may contain million  billion of records. Now stakeholders are suggesting to use Spark as they feel it is faster than MapReduce. But I think for this scenario Spark will be not suitable as it is good for analytic application not for batch processing. Also I could see only API in Spark which is like aggregate function, unable to find any inbuilt API to read  record by record and column by column like MapReduce. Please suggest your approach on this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1AvR0.png altSource Input File which needs to be transformed with given configurationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFkhWG.png altGenerated output with given input and configp

Negative 62392 pI am working with a bunch of images in a div, When the page is loaded all the thumbnails are 30 of opacity.

Negative 62392 pI am building a large table 3,000 rows with the ngrepeat directive from AngularJS 1.2.26. The data is a very simple array of arrays of time and temperature code[[time, temperature], [time, temperature], ...]code. p  pThis is how the data is displayed in a table using a hrefhttpslimlang.com relnofollowSlim templatingap  precode  table.table.tablebordered     thead       tr         th.time.firstchild tTime         th.temperature.sensor     tbody       tr[bindonce ngrepeatitem in readings]         td.datetime           span.date botextformatDateitem.time           span.time bohtmlformatTimeitem.time         td botextitem.reading.temperature  number 2  codepre  pAs you can see, we are using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comPasvazbindonce relnofollowbind oncea library to reduce the number of angular watchers. This is a report so we dont need to uphold data binding. p  pLoading the data and rendering the report takes about 4 seconds on Chrome or Firefox and 8 seconds on Internet Explorer 11. However, after the table is built on internet explorer, the browser will take up to two minutes performing Garbage Collection according to the UI Responsiveness tab. p  pI need more reputation to post pictures, so Ill try to describe what is happening as best I can. p  pThe whole table rendering process occurs as a result of the codexhr.onreadystatechangecode event listener which has since been removed from angular in 1.3. Each row and span are added to the table with codeappendChildcode  codeinsertBeforecode functions from jQuery or the codeinnerHTMLcode function from the browser. These happen thousands of times and account for the 8 seconds that I mentioned before. Once these are completed, these are immediately followed by a few lines of garbage collection that, in total, take well over 60 seconds.p  pIn absence of a picture of the output, this is a list of the time at which the execution started after the last codeappendChildcode, followed by the total execution time the length of the bar in the window.p  ol li0.24 s, 0.0065 msli li0.36 s, 13.83 msli li0.85 s, 0.31 msli li10 s, 0.0042 msli li57 s, 25.54 msli li60 s, 0.048 msli ol  pThen, there is another gap of about 10 s before the rest of the process proceeds. p  pI dont understand what is happening here, because each individual garbage collection is very short, but the gap between them is very long. I dont know much about garbage collection in the browsers, so that my be hindering my understanding. This is not happening in Chrome or Firefox.p  pIve followed various guides about analyzing memory profiling. I do not believe there is a memory leak. Again, I cant add more links because of my reputation, but I followed the Chrome one titled JavaScript Memory Profiling and the IE one titled Improving UI Responsiveness.p  pThere is another piece of this that Im not sure if it is relevant or not, but Ill mention it here in case it is. When you run a profiling session during this delay, IE says that the delay is during the requestAnimationFrame codehttpsgithub.comangularangular.jsblobmastersrcngraf.jsL15code function of AngularJS codeRAFProvidercode. This may be related to the fact that AngularJS fires an enter event for every row added via ngrepeat. Ive been trying to disable that animation event without luck so far.p  pAny advice or troubleshooting tips would be very much appreciated. Specifically, it would be great if I could add a breakpoint on the garbage collection to see what is going on, but I dont think I could do that.p
Negative 62392 pIm currently working on some C code which defines many things via macros and Ive figured out the following regex which is working quite well in including these macros when looking for symbol definitionsp  precodeegrep nrw include.c,h,ipp,xx  structclassusingnamespace typedef.[AZ][AZ].Symbol . codepre  pI am trying to map CtrlF to this command in vim, and currently have the followingp  precodemap ltCFgt tabnewltCRgtredrawltCRgtr egrep nrw include.c,h,ipp,xx  structltbargtclassltbargtusingltbargtnamespace ltbargttypedef.ltbargt[AZ][AZ].Symbol . codepre  pThis works, but itd be great to automatically replace codeSymbolcode with the word under the cursor when I press CtrlF.

The Google Documantation says, the Api delivers normaly an Object, and just in some rare cases, the Object can be null. But it is null, as soon as the User disables the Location Service in Android. This is more the standard than the rare case. I thought it would at least give me the last known location which was saved anywhere, or a location with really low precission.  Am I doing anything wrong Is there a way to get the location anytime I need it  the precission is not important, as long as it is not far away  Thanks in advance.p
Negative 62392 pIm currently developing an app that uses codeSystem.Diagnostics.Processcode to get the Window Title of the Current Active App or the App on the ForeGround. Now, this is fine and working with the current code I have until I came across with this issue. This codeNullReferenceExceptioncode occurs if I switch my app using the task bar icon instead of the minimized button of the app window.p  pEdit It maybe confusing if I dont raise this up. So basically codeNullReferenceExceptioncode is caused by codetitle.EqualsSystem.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess.MainWindowTitlecodep  ptitle variable is null due to p  precodeString title  GetActiveWindowTitle codepre  pGetActiveWindowTitle returns null. And this uses codeWindow.GetForegroundWindowcode And for some reason using taskbar icons to switch up, this codeWindow.GetForegroundWindowcode method returns nothing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEGOge.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGNrxq.png altenter image description herep  pOriginally I used this         p  precode[DllImportuser32.dll] public static extern IntPtr GetForegroundWindow codepre  pTo get what I need. But Im still having the same issue when switching app using the task bar icon. The only difference with using this code is that the exception is this  codeA first chance exception of type System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception occurred in System.dllcodep  pMy operating system is Windows 8.1.p  pAny inputs is greatly appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrong The answer from KcDoD was somewhat correct. And since the codeNullReferenceExceptioncode was actually part of my question I will mark it as the Answer. And it also guides me a lot to figure out whats going on. p  pBasically, on my application I call this method codeGetActiveWindowTitlecode within codeWinEventProcIntPtr hWinEventHook, uint eventType, IntPtr hwnd, int idObject, int idChild, uint dwEventThread, uint dwmsEventTimecode. WinEventProc is a delegate method that triggers when you switch window. And it turns out that by calling codeGetForegroundWindowcode or codeGetActiveWindowTitlecode the process is not active yet thats why when it goes to get the Active application or Process it givesreturn null.p  pBest regardsp

Negative 62392 pI have a table view of posts, all of which contain URLs in their text bodies, and whenever I interact with the initial URL through p  precode BOOLtextViewUITextView textView shouldInteractWithURLNSURLURL inRangeNSRangecharacterRange              present webview here         return NO      codepre  pAfter I dismiss the modal view controller displaying the web view, the entire text of the text view turns blue and becomes clickable like the URL. I swizzled the UITextView implementation of setTextColor, but to no avail, as the text color doesnt seem to be the problem alone since all the text is becoming clickable if anyone knows the method that is called to do that, that would greatly help as well since I could swizzle its implementation. I have no idea what could be happening, and since its not an explicit method call on my end, it might be a UIKit bug, but Id really like a third party point of view. p

Negative 62392 pWe are a group of computer science student, currently working on a project as part of our Master.p  pOur problem is as follows.p  pWe are working on an app for Android that requires devices to exchange small amounts of data. This needs to work without mobile connections or existing WiFi networks, e.g. using Bluetooth, WiFi direct etc.p  pWe have looked at Bluetooth smart, which allows a device to run advertising mode sending 31 bytes of data, this would be more than adequate for our needs. But it is only supported in Android 5.0 so this seriously limits our availability.p  pMessage confirmation and error checking is a plus but it is not a requirement. So an Udp connection is a possibility. p  pAll the solutions that we can find either involves the user actively accepting a peer request, which is not acceptable since there could be hundreds of devices communicating with each other, or rooting the device.p  pIn short what we are looking for is a way for a device to broadcast a small amount of data, around 24 bytes is the minimum. Without the user needing to do anything other than starting up the app.p

For example, for SBYZipArchive I had the following in my file I imported the lt SBYZipArchiveSBYZipArchive.h header.p  pstrong4.strong I try to build the application and it fails on multiple places all referencing the codezlib.hcode library. p  pstrong5.strong I attempted to provide access to the codezlibcode library by adding the codelibz.dylibcode to the Build Phases under Link Binary with Libraries. p  pstrong6.strong I attempt to build the application, and it still doesnt love me.p  pTo my knowledge the reason why none of these frameworks is working is because they are for some reason failing to access the zlib files that are necessary to do the actual data compression.

Negative 62392 pI have set up a cassandra cluster with only two nodes on two servers with identical hardware configuration in the same internal network recently. It works well with cqlsh, everything seems perfect. Then I followed the code example in datastaxs website to write java code to work with the cluster and problems comes. The program works, it connects to the cluster and successfully writes to and reads data from it. However, the connection is way too slow I deployed the code in the same machine where one of the cluster node resides and it takes over 5 seconds to connect. More precisely, its the line emsession  cluster.connectem takes most of the time. p  pI tried to setup another cassandra cluster with only one node in the same network, with similar hardware configuration. It takes around 1 second to connect. So i think its likely i missed some configurations when writing the code. I spend quite some time searching for answer but could not get any. Given the 5 seconds connection time, it very hard for me to consider to use it as a replacement for my current database.p  pIn addition, the ping time among these machines are within 1ms, so i dont think its the networks problem. using cqlsh to connect to cluster is very fast too. p  pThe cassandra version is 2.1.4 and the maven dependency for datastax is p  precodeltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtcom.datastax.cassandraltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtcassandradrivercoreltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt2.1.4ltversiongt ltdependencygt codepre  pSo i wonder if anyone could enlighten me on why its takes so long to connect to the cluster with only two nodes.

Negative 62392 pggplot2 does not seem to have a builtin way of dealing with overplotting for text on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11197554howtojittertexttoavoidoverlapinaggplot2scatterplotscatter plotsa. However, I have a different situation where the labels are those on a discrete axis and Im wondering if someone here has a better solution than what Ive been doing.p  pSome example codep  precodelibraryggplot2  some example data test.data  data.frametext  cA full commitments what Im thinking of,                                 History quickly crashing through your veins,                                 And I take A deep breath and I get real high,                                 And again, the Internet is not something that you just dump something on. Its not a big truck.,                        mean  c3.5, 3, 5, 4,                        CI.lower  c4, 3.5, 5.5, 4.5,                        CI.upper  c3, 2.5, 4.5, 3.5  plot ggplottest.data, aesstringx  text, y  mean    geompointstatidentity    geomerrorbaraesymax  CI.upper, ymin  CI.lower, width  .1    scalexdiscretelabels  test.datatext, name   codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRslRT.png altenter image description herep  pSo we see that the xaxis labels are on top of each other. Two solutions spring to mind 1 abbreviating the labels, and 2 adding newlines to the labels. In many cases 1 will do, but in some cases it cannot be done. So I wrote a function for adding newlines codencode every nth characters to the strings to avoid overlapping namesp  precodelibraryggplot2  Inserts newlines into strings every N interval newlinesadder  functiontest.string, interval   length of str   string.length  nchartest.string   split by N char intervals   split.starts  seq1,string.length,interval   split.ends  csplit.starts[1]1,nchartest.string   split it   test.string  substringtest.string, split.starts, split.ends   put it back together with newlines   test.string  paste0test.string,collapse  n   returntest.string   a userlevel wrapper that also works on character vectors, data.frames, matrices and factors addnewlines  functionx, interval    if classx  data.frame  classx  matrix  classx  factor      x  as.vectorx       if lengthx  1      returnnewlinesadderx, interval    else      t  sapplyx, FUN  newlinesadder, interval  interval apply splitter to each     namest  NULL remove names     returnt      plot again ggplottest.data, aesstringx  text, y  mean    geompointstatidentity    geomerrorbaraesymax  CI.upper, ymin  CI.lower, width  .1    scalexdiscretelabels  addnewlinestest.datatext, 20, name   codepre  pAnd the output is img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBx0sM.png altenter image description herep  pThen one can spend some time playing with the interval size to avoid having too much whitespace between labels.p  pIf the number of labels vary, this kind of solution is not so good, as the optimal interval size changes. Also, because the normal font is not monospaced, the text of the labels have an effect on the width too, and so one has to take extra care in selecting a good interval one can avoid this by using a monospace font, but they are extra wide. Finally, the codenewlinesaddercode function is stupid in that it will split words into two in silly ways humans would not do. E.g. in the above it split breath into brnreath. One could rewrite it to avoid this problem.p  pOne can also decrease the font size, but this is a trade off with the readability and often decreasing the font size is unnecessary.p  pWhat is the best way of handling this kind of label overplottingp

Negative 62392 pWhen installing inside a cabal sandbox, cabal will still use packages from the global package db in particular, packages which came from the Haskell Platform. This can lead to install conflicts. Is it possible to configure cabal to ignore the global package dbp  pI see the corresponding feature has been implemented in codeghccode itself, via a codenoglobalpackagedbcode option see a hrefhttpsghc.haskell.orgtracghcticket5977 relnofollowhttpsghc.haskell.orgtracghcticket5977a, and codeghcpkgcode will ignore the global package db if you do not pass it the codeglobalcode flag.

Negative 62392 pIm currently working on a Unity3D iOS plugin. Im trying to change the category of the apps AVAudioSession in order to implement audio ducking i.e. Music app volume goes down while my sound effects are playing, which requires the AVAudioSession to be set as inactive and then as active again.p  pWell, after I set the session as inactive by using code[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActiveNO errornil]code, Unity sounds simply wont work anymore, even after the session is set as active again. Native sounds still work, as I tested an AVAudioPlayer and it works perfectly.p  pAny idea on whats wrongp

Negative 62392 pI am a beginner in coding in general, but I know my way around the basics. as a challenge, and possibly a tool for map generation, I wanted to see if I could use python to create a small text based 5x5 maze generator that is isolated no exits or entrances that allows both loops and dead ends. I hand drew one as an examplep  precode                             codepre  parrows represent dead ends coming from the opposite direction of the arrowp  pI was unable to make much progress, and gave up rather quickly, deciding that my coding knowledge was not at the level to create something this complex. now I want to know if there is a simple way to do such a thing. after going down a rabbit hole of spanning trees, visual codes, and the such, 95 of which I barely understood, I couldnt find much to help me. Im looking for a hopefully easy to understand way of creating a piece of code that could achieve this. Ideally I want the answer to be in python, and be something relatively easy to understand for a beginnermedium programmer given enough time. Also, please excuse any horribly vagueoverlycomplicated parts of this question I have written, they would most likely be due to the fact that I dont know much about this area of coding. p  pif there is a simpler way to phrase this question, or significantly easier methods of creating a 5x5 maze other than making it text based, these are also very welcome p
Negative 62392 pI have a Joomla plugindriven portal. the plugin is installed and does what I need in browsers. Now I am trying to build a codeWebViewcode App using the joomlaplugin html directly. I can do this by designing a new joomla template that looks like my app. Now if I activate the template, it will take over the web version. p  pHow can I have a work around probably with a codeUserAgentcode string or anything else to specify the request is from the app so I can use the designed template instead of the default one, and the default one still works in other web browsers. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 62392 pSuppose in addition of simple text terms i want to retrieve some complex data from text. For example, text can contain descriptions of graphs in some format. After that I want to do queries which contain some conditions on those graphs for examle I want to find all documents with planar graphs or something like this. It seems that standard index of Solr is not sufficient for such a task because in the end it as I understand treats document in terms of tokens which are just strings, but I need additional index which have more suited format. So question is can I somehow customize indexing and retrieving data from index in Solr Ive read a lot of documentation but could not find an answer. p

Negative 62392 pI am currently working on a DB integrated daily file transfer scheduling form application for operational business use. In order to be able to control and have access to specific schedules, I have decided to create a thread for each schedule so that a specific schedule could be stopped, or restarted on demand. To achieve this, I have written a separate class which includes a custom thread class and its constructor, a main class to create and run an instance of thread and another class that includes the runnable method of daily scheduling. In order to be able to access specific threads, I have tried to implement a ConcurrentHashMap to synchronise the hashcodes and the names of the threads created, along with a ThreadGroup. When I create a thread, I am able to pass the name and the hashcode of the thread to the ConcurrentHashMap, along with the ThreadGroup.

There is no logger for springdataredis nor jedis either. So they are not throwing exceptions as I am not catching any and they have no log output. Apparently the request is being made to springdataredis, and springdataredis is returning back to my code with no exceptions.pli ol  pstrongNext steps on troubleshootingstrongp  pThere is very minimal amount of logging in springdataredis and its underlying redis driver Jedis. Ive enabeled logging on the 2, will see if that helps whenif the issue happens again.p  pIve also considered debugging this but I think would rather just switch to a different driverproject at this point.p
Negative 62392 pCurrently Ive got some swift code like thisp  precodeclass C     let type Type    var num  0    init         self.type  Type num Int gt Void in            self.num  num              codepre  pThe Swift compiler refuses to permit it, saying that Ive referenced codeself.typecode before its initialized, even though thats clearly completely untrue. Furthermore, I cant employ the workaround found in other questionsanswers, because the codetypecode is not optional, and its immutable, so it cant be initialized with codenilcode pointlessly first.p  pHow can I make the Swift compiler accept this perfectly valid codep  pThis has nothing to do with returning from the initializer early. The callback is executed asynchronously it is stored and then used later.p  pI also have a few further codeletcodes that are initialized after this one. I would have to turn them emallem into mutable optionals, even though theyre not optional and cant be mutated.p
Negative 62392 pIm interested in general solutions for loop unrolling at compile time Im using this in a SIMD setting where each function call takes a specific number of clock cycles and multiple calls can be performed in parallel, so I need to tune the number of accumulators to minimise wasted cycles  adding additional accumulators and manually unrolling yields significant improvements, but is laborious. p  pIdeally Id like to be able to write things likep  precodeunrollltNgtf,args...  with f a predefined function unrollltNgt[]...  ... ,args...  using a lambda codepre  pand generate the followingp  precodef1,args... f2,args... ... fN,args... codepre  pSo far I have three different template metaprogram solutions, and am wondering what are the advantagesdisadvantages of the different approaches, especially regarding how the compiler will inline the function calls.p  pstrongApproach 1 recursive functionstrong p  precodetemplate ltint Ngt struct int   template ltint N, typename F, typename ...Argsgt inline void unrollfintltNgt, Fampamp f, Argsampamp... args            unrollfintltN1gt,stdforwardltFgtf,stdforwardltArgsgtargs...     fN,args...  template lttypename F, typename ...Argsgt inline void unrollfintlt1gt, Fampamp f, Argsampamp... args      f1,args...  codepre  pCall syntax examplep  precodeint x  2 auto mult  []int n,int x  stdcout ltlt nx ltlt     unrollfintlt10gt,mult,x  also works with anonymous lambda unrollfintlt10gt,mult,2  same syntax when argument is temporary  codepre  pstrongApproach 2 recursive constructorstrongp  precodetemplate ltint N, typename F, typename ...Argsgt struct unrollc      unrollcFampamp f, Argsampamp... args                      unrollcltN1,F,Args...gtstdforwardltFgtf,stdforwardltArgsgtargs...         fN,args...       template lttypename F, typename ...Argsgt struct unrollclt1,F,Args...gt      unrollcFampamp f, Argsampamp... args          f1,args...       codepre  pCall syntax is pretty uglyp  precodeunrollclt10,decltypemultamp,intampgtmult,x  unrollclt10,decltypemultamp,intampgtmult,2  doesnt compile codepre  pand the type of the function must be specified explicitly if using an anonymous lambda, which is awkward. p  pstrongApproach 3 recursive static member functionstrongp  precodetemplate ltint Ngt struct unrolls      template lttypename F, typename ...Argsgt     static inline void applyFampamp f, Argsampamp... args          unrollsltN1gtapplystdforwardltFgtf,stdforwardltArgsgtargs...                 fN,args...           cant use static operator instead of apply  template ltgt struct unrollslt1gt      template lttypename F, typename ...Argsgt     static inline void applyFampamp f, Argsampamp... args          f1,stdforwardltArgsgtargs...       codepre  pCall syntax examplep  precodeunrollslt10gtapplymult,x unrollslt10gtapplymult,2  codepre  pIn terms of syntax this third approach seems the cleanest and clearest, but Im wondering if there may be differences in how the three approaches are treated by the compiler.p

Negative 62392 pjQuery Mobile predominantly uses html5 attributes. So if the browser does not support html5, it ignores those attributes and renders a normal html web page. And without using jQuery Mobile also we can create code.htmlcode files and code.jscode files. And they can be used to create stand alone application using phoneGap or something else. So what is the actual advantage of using this jQuery Mobile. p  pIs it only for UI purposep
Negative 62392 pI use storyboard and autolayout.p  pI place a thin UIView inside a UIViewControllers UIView which gets pushed to a UINavigationController. Then I add constraint to make the thin UIView resize itself to keep xmargin  0 and xendingmargin  0. left edge to right edgep  pI see that it recommends the value for the constraint as 20 and also 20 for the trailing space. If I set it to 0, I see whitespace before and after my UIView. Why What is that 20p  pWhen I test it on a small device like iPhone 5, I see that 20 becomes more like 30 or something..p  pWhy does that happen Is there a way to somehow fix it so I can safely use 0 as the constraint for every situationp

Negative 62392 pIn my project I use JavaFX FileChooser to let the user save files. I noticed a bug, where a file with a specified file filter would always save as a .txt on Linux systems. From another stackoverflow thread I leaned that unlike Windows, on Linux the codefileChooser.showSaveDialogcode returns a file without the chosen file extension. I am confident, that this irregular implementation has a very obvious cause that I am not understanding. But still I am not sure how to adapt this for my needs. p  pI am aware that there are some other solved threads about a similar topic, but all the solutions are based on extracting the extension from the returned file, where in my case there is no extension returned by showSaveDialog.p
