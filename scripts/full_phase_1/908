Positive 908 pIm working on an app that should be hidden behind login view. p  pSo in general, I have a tab navigation controller which should hold pretty much the entire app and my logic is when the app loads, the initial View controller is the tab navigation controller, which shows its first View IF the user is logged in. If its not logged in, they should see loginregister page. Both login and register page work with Parse, they are ok and function well. They are presented Modally using segues on top of the first View in the Tab view controller. p  pThe issue is that when I login and I confirm that it works the login View controller is not dismissed in order to see the tab view controller and I think that I might have messed something up in the segues. The segue to present the login view if the user is not logged in is made from the protected view not its navigation controller, although i tested that too, doesnt work to login view controller. p  pAlso, the code in the protected page is like this p  precodeoverride func viewDidAppearanimated Bool      self.performSegueWithIdentifiersegueToLoginView, sender self  codepre  pHeres what my story board looks likep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comd7qLY.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd7qLY.png altenter image description hereap  pSo, the login segue is presented modally and heres my code for the login button.p  precodeIBAction func loginButtonTappedsender AnyObject       let username  usernameTextField.text     let password  passwordTextField.text        Sends to Parse to see if user exists     PFUser.logInWithUsernameInBackgroundusername, password password          user PFUser, error NSError gt Void in          if user  nil                LOGIN Successful             NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.setBooltrue, forKey isUserLoggedIn             NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.synchronize             self.dismissViewControllerAnimatedtrue, completion nil             printUser logged in           else                Display Failed Login Alert message with confirmation             let failedLoginAttepmt  UIAlertController                 title Ups,                 message Something went wrong, try again...,                 preferredStyle UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert                          let confirmAction  UIAlertAction                 title OK,                 style UIAlertActionStyle.Default                  action in                     self.dismissViewControllerAnimatedtrue, completion nil                               failedLoginAttepmt.addActionconfirmAction             self.presentViewControllerfailedLoginAttepmt, animated true, completion nil              printCould not find the user          codepre  pand this line of code codeself.dismissViewControllerAnimatedtrue, completion nilcode should dismiss the modally presented login view controller, as I do see the print statement in the console. p  pWheres my mistakep

Negative 908 pIm working on an application that consists of an overall Quartzbased scheduler and CycledJob run using CronTriggers. The purpose of the application is to process inputs from different email inboxes based on the source country. p  pBased on the country that it comes in from i.e. US, UK, FR, etc. the application triggers one job thread to run each countrys processing cycle, so there would be a UK Worker thread, one for US, France, etc. When formatting the output to log4j, Im using the thread parameter, so it emits [ApplicationNameWorker1], [ApplicationNameWorker2] etc. Try as I might, I cant find a way to name the threads since theyre pulled out of Quartzs Thread Pools. Although I could possibly go so far as to extend Quartz, Id like to work out a different solution instead of messing with the standard library.p  pHeres the problem When using log4j, Id like to have all log items from the US thread output to a US only file, likewise for each of the country threads. I dont care if they stay in one unified ConsoleAppender, the FileAppender split is what Im after here. I already know how to specify multiple file appenders and such, my issue is I cant differentiate based on country. There are 20 classes within the application that can be on the execution chain, very few of which I want to burden with the knowledge of passing an extra context parameter through EVERY method... Ive considered a Strategy pattern extending a log4j wrapper class, but unless I can let every class in the chain know which thread its on to parameterize the logger call, that seems impossible. Without being able to name the thread also creates a challenge or else this would be easy.p  pSo heres the question What would be a suggested approach to allow many subordinate classes in an application that are each used for every different thread to process the input know that they are within the context of a particular country thread when they are loggingp  pGood luck understanding, and please ask clarifying questions I hope someone is able to help me figure out a decent way to tackle this. All suggestions welcome.p

Negative 908 pSo Im looking over some code Ive written and noticed that most of the function calls are parameterless and return void. They tend to use public properties instead of arguments and return values. This was an outgrowth of the architectural pattern I was using and I just wound up extending it. The canonical example of MVP passive view has the view exposing properties about itself and delegating all real work to the presenter through void parameterless function calls.p  pWhen I noticed I was using this in my domain and database layers I started to feel I was somehow ignoring the notion of encapsulation.p  pHave I misused a good idea where it was never intended to be usedp  p[Clarification]p  pAll called objects hold a reference to an interface, which the calling object implements. This interface exposes any data needed by the called object to its job. In most cases, the called object only modifies a single property of the calling object. This mirrors how the presenter and view communicate in a Passive View pattern. Up to this point all exposed properties are readonly unless need dictates otherwise.p  pThe more I think about it, the more uneasy I become with the whole approach. Its fine for viewpresenter interaction because the view simply passes any changes directly to the UI. Domain and Database objects are much more complex and the potential for unintentional changes is much greater.p

Negative 908 pI need medium to strong encryption on serverside, so I thought I would use mcrypt with PHP. If I use the functions below the beginning of my original string turns into binary garbage after decryption. This is not the usual problem of getting appended emadditionalem garbage, instead my string is emalteredem. According to the documentation, mcryptencrypt should have padded enough characters to match the block size of the selected algorithm but I suspect it does not work. p  pHowever, if I pad it manually to the block size of 128 bit 16 bytes of Rijndael, it doesnt work either. The only way I can get this to work is by prepending some string long enough to likely cover the garbaged block and add a known prefix like DATA between that string and my data. After decryption that block has been partially mangled but my prefix and all data after that has been correctly decrypted.p  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeGLOBALS[encryptionmarker]  DATA  function encryptplain, key            workaround because beginning of decrypted string is being mangled      so we simply prefix with some text plus marker     prefix  strpad, 128, , STRPADRIGHT.GLOBALS[encryptionmarker]     plain  prefix.plain           encrypted  mcryptencryptMCRYPTRIJNDAEL256, key, plain, MCRYPTMODECFB,         mcryptcreateivmcryptgetivsizeMCRYPTRIJNDAEL256, MCRYPTMODECFB,         MCRYPTDEVURANDOM      return encrypted   function decryptencrypted, key      decrypted  mcryptdecryptMCRYPTRIJNDAEL256, key, encrypted, MCRYPTMODECFB,         mcryptcreateivmcryptgetivsizeMCRYPTRIJNDAEL256, MCRYPTMODECFB,         MCRYPTDEVURANDOM            workaround remove garbage     pos  strposdecrypted, GLOBALS[encryptionmarker]     decrypted  trimsubstrdecrypted, pos  strlenGLOBALS[encryptionmarker]           return decrypted  codepre  pWhats wrong with my functions Why do I have to prefix my data like that I consider it a dirty workaround, so I would like to fix itp  pStoring the encrypted data is not the problem decrypting it immediately after encryption without storing it to a database results in the same errors.p

Negative 908 pI have never really done much C but am starting to play around with it. I am writing little snippets like the one below to try to understand the usage and behaviour of key constructsfunctions in C. The one below I wrote trying to understand the difference between codechar stringcode and codechar string[]code and how then lengths of strings work. Furthermore I wanted to see if codesprintfcode could be used to concatenate two strings and set it into a third string.p  pWhat I discovered was that the third string I was using to store the concatenation of the other two had to be set with codechar string[]code syntax or the binary would die with codeSIGSEGV Address boundary errorcode. Setting it using the array syntax required a size so I initially started by setting it to the combined size of the other two strings. This seemed to let me perform the concatenation well enough. p  pOut of curiosity, though, I tried expanding the concatenated string to be longer than the size I had allocated. Much to my surprise, it still worked and the string size increased and could be codeprintfcoded fine.p  pMy question is Why does this happen, is it invalid or have risksdrawbacks Furthermore, why is codechar str3[length3]code valid but codechar str3[7]code causes SIGABRT Abort when codesprintfcode line tries to executep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt  void main      char str1  Sup     char str2  Dood      int length1  strlenstr1     int length2  strlenstr2     int length3  length1  length2      char str3[length3]     char str3[7]      printfs length dn, str1, length1            Sup length 3     printfs length dn, str2, length2            Dood length 4     printftotal length dn, length3              total length 7     printfstr3 length dn, intstrlenstr3       str3 length 6     sprintfstr3, sltgts, str1, str2      printfsn, str3  SupltgtDood      printfstr3 length after sprintf dn,   str3 length after sprintf 29     intstrlenstr3  codepre

Negative 908 pIve got a tabbar setup with a few tabs.  The first tabitem is viewcontroller that programmatically loads a xib that is laid out in portrait.  When the user rotates the phone, it automatically presents a modal view that is laid out in landscape.  This mechanism works fine.p  pWhen the device is rotated to portrait mode, it dismisses the modal view and a tabbar is visible at the bottom.  I would like for some of my other tabbar items such as a scrollview and an webview to autorotate to landscape when the device is rotated.p  pIve implemented a class called RotateTabBarViewController which contains the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation method and checks the value of the same method on the selectedViewController.  So if I have the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation method  in my webview returning true then the view will rotate as expected.p  pHeres the problem. While the rotated view is in landscape mode, the tabbar is still visible meaning a user can click the icon for the first item.  When the first item is clicked it knows its in landscape mode and automatically loads the modal view again.  The only problem is the view is offset on the screen.p  pIm looking for a solution that will realign the modal view to where its supposed to be.  Im not sure if its the main view that needs to be realigned or just the modal view.p  pThe following link contains a demo of the concept. p  pa hrefhttpwww.veryniceindustries.comrotation5Fdemo.zip relnofollowhttpwww.veryniceindustries.comrotation5Fdemo.zipap  ul liRotate the device to portraitli liSelect Item Twoli liRotate the device to landscape need some help realigning this viewli liSelect Item One modal appears for landscape, but is offsetli ul  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pBest, Howiep

Negative 908 pI have been working on trying to get a page to display a title at the top of the content pane, and then a scrollable list of products below that so that the title of the product range is displayed at all times. I am sure this is a very simple thing to do  but cannot figure it out.p  pCurrently the actual page not the test page for which the code is given below works ok in the sense that I set the heading div to 5 of the height of code.contentcontainercode and then set the scrollable div to 95 with codetop 5code, both with codeposition absolutecode applied. p  pHowever I would like to place some links in the heading div to different pages 1, 2, 3 etc, which I would like to center vertically if they are shorter than the heading and expand the heading div to match the height of the heading or the links, whichever is smallest. Furthermore I would like the div below the heading to shrink so that it doesnt go below the bottom of the content div as the heading div gets taller. The point of this is because it is for a client who may, or may not, be happy with the heading sizes and so on  therefore the heading div height could easily change. Specifying heights so precisely means that changing the codeh1code height could mean 5 changes to the CSS file  something I want to avoid. p  pThe content pane currently has its height fixed to 80 of the page, with the header and footer being 10 each on top of that, so there is no scroll bar at the side of the page and the header  footer are always showing. This is something I would like to keep.p  pIn the code below, code.contentcontainercode is the main content pane  this is contained in another div which is centered using the margin at 50 of the page width. code.testdivcode is the div which contains the heading. code.testdiv2code is an attempt to place a div below code.testdivcode, in the hope that I can force code.testdiv3code to extend to 100 of its height but no further, and to display a scroll bar if the content exceeds the height.p  pSo far I have the following, but it doesnt do exactly what I would like it top  precodeltdiv classcontentcontainergt     ltdiv classtestdivgt         lth1 styletextalign centergtDogslth1gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classtestdiv2gt          ltdiv classtestdiv3gt               Content here          ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pand here is the css p  precode.contentcontainer      position absolute     width 100     height 100     left 0     right 0     bottom 0     overflow auto   .testdiv      position relative     padding 0     margin 0   .testdiv2      position relative     backgroundcolor CCCCCC   .testdiv3      maxheight 100     backgroundcolor 999999  codepre  pAny help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 908 pI have an application in Android that dumps the sensor values to the SDcard memory of the phone and kills itself when I press a button on the screen. I am using Sensordelayfastest to get maximum update of the sensors. p  pMy problem is that since Im doing all my computation on the UI thread, the button takes very long to respond, which is very bad for my application as it records all the extra values after I press the Kill button. I understand that I should put my computations in another thread, but Im not sure how I would do that for event handling operations. For instance, I havep  precodeprotected void onResume               super.onResume         sm.registerListenerthis, sm.getDefaultSensorSensor.TYPEACCELEROMETER, SensorManager.SENSORDELAYFASTEST         sm.registerListenerthis, sm.getDefaultSensorSensor.TYPEORIENTATION, SensorManager.SENSORDELAYFASTEST      codepre  pand onStop, and the functions onSensorChanged and onAccuracyChanged, which are executed when the event fires. Actually, the main heavy computation is in my onSensorChanged, where I write the values on the SDcard, which is probably causing the delay. But I cant put it in a different thread because then itll create a LOT of threads as the events keep firing. p  pSo how do I make this system more responsive Im really new to Android, and some help by means of some sample code will be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks allp  pEDIT Can I make a thread implement an interface, like SensorEventListener and then implmeent OnResume and OnStop within that threadp

Negative 908 pWhen performing a delete of a onemany relationship without exposing the foreign key, EF deletes the parent record and tries to null the foreign key on the child records.

Negative 908 pSo I need some advice for network synchronizationbr br  Im connecting to a TeamSpeak 3 Query Server.  The server has the command servernotifyregister  which will cause the server to push a notification to me when  happens. Likewise, each command i.e. whoami has a response associated with it.  The problem I face is  say I send whoami and someone joins the server at the same time, the server pushes the event to me and I read it thinking its the response to my whoami command. I dont want to have to recognize each message and determine if it is in the form of a response or pushed eventbr  br  The best solution I can come up with is one where I connect twice, once for events and once for commands.  Unfortunately Teamspeak shows a virtual client for each query server connection.  Is there a more elegant solutionp  pbr  br  Thanks, br  Benp

Negative 908 pSo far I have been using SQL Server Express on my desktop application even though usually the server is only used by that single application, by the single user, on the same single machine. This always seemed a bit silly to me since the fullon server is rather heavy.p  pThen I found out that there is something called SQL Server Compact. Thing is, my application is already rather large. So my question is that if I wanted to change to SQL Server Compact, what kind of changes to my code are we talking about using Cp  pMainly Im wondering if I can access the Compact version in the same manner as I can access the Express one, which is using ADO.NET and pointing it towards localhostsqlexpress. So would it be possible to create another instance with the Compact and just point my application to that, or is it used in a completely different mannerp

Negative 908 pI am facing a difficult problem. I need to implement a custom diagnostics section just like the system.diagnostics in the app.config for a managed application. The scenario is as follows p  pI have an XML file which has a list of trace sources and listeners associated with each of the trace sources.And there is other stuff in the XML file which is not related to the tracing.What I need to do is, read the XML file and set up the trace sources and listeners just like .NET does at application startup. When I do something likep  pTraceSource sample  new TraceSourceSampleTraceSource the application should be able to set up the trace source SampleTraceSource that is in my XML file, rather than pick it up from the app.config. As of now, .NET does all this behind the scenes so you neednt worry about how it is implemented. I believe this is done in System.dll when the application starts.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 908 pIve run into a bit of an issue and not sure how to get round it.p  pWe have a number of polymorphic nested resources in our datamodel, egp  pDestination  Accommodation  Addressp  pDestination  Attraction  Addressp  pSo it is possible to arrive at the Address controller from multiple parents. I need to be able to associate these correctly and also navigate back up the tree of parents.p  pAddress is the same model in these cases, so my first solution for this was to created nested resources in the routes file. We then also started to use this nesting to provide a breadcrumb navigation thing, so when our URLS get like thisp  plocalhost3000destinations1accommodations3addressnewp  pWe can split it up and use it to navigate back down the path to any level.p  pI also, to make the controller generic, I use the nested resources to work out what the parent resource for map is, so the controller looks like thisp  precodedef new      parent  findparentmodel       if parent.nil      destination  parent.destinations.new codepre  p[...]p  precodedef findparent    params.each do name, value      if name  .id        return 1.classify.constantize.findvalue      end    end    nil  end codepre  pThis works. But the problem is that we have 1800 lines of nested resources in the routes.rb file and now it takes the rails app about 5 minutes to start, and it sits there using 500MB of ram.

My app consisted 6 pages of tabs and, sure, in the running application these tabs decrease to the narrow rectangles  thats really looks bad.

Negative 908 pIn my app, I use a static variable to hold the current user id. There is a bug that is very hard to reproduce of this user id simply disappearing. While it could be related to a bug in how this variable is set during application loading I still wasnt able to reliably reproduce this situation in a controlled environment, so Im not really sure exactly what happens, Im starting to think this is related to how memory gets reclaimed from static variables something I didnt consider before.p  pSo, when can my static variable simply disappearp  ul liAs far as I understand, static memory can get reclaimed if the OS reports low memory  can it happen while the app is in the foreground Or only backgroundli liAre there any possible ways static memory is getting reclaimed without a low memory condition I think sometimes the variable disappears without the app even going to the background and Im not sure any low memory events occur AFAIK low memory refers to the whole OS, not the apps memoryli liWhat is a good way to simulate static variables getting reclaimed by the OS to see how the application behaves and subsequently fix the bugsli ul  pAnything adding more clarity to my understanding will be appreciated.p  pThank you.p

The profile is purposely being created before the root User object, so Ive defined the OauthProfile user property to allow NULL, with a default of None.p  pWhen saving an object of type TwitterProfileInfo without assigning a value to its user property or explicitly assigning it to None, I was expecting appnameoauthprofile.userid to be left NULL in the database.  Instead, looking at the PostgreSQL log, I can see its being assigned the value I had assigned to the objects userid property.  This causes a referential integrity error because theres no row in the authuser table having that value.p  precodemyProfile  TwitterProfileInfo myProfile.user  None myProfile.userid  12345  Django tries to assign this to appnameoauthprofile.userid myProfile.screenname  sometwitteruser myProfile.oauthtoken  1234567890abcdefg myProfile.oauthsecret  sometauthtokensecret myProfile.save  results in error codepre  pI could just rename one of the conflicting fields, changing the TwitterProfileInfo field name to something like twitteruserid, for example.

If I didnt have control of the database and was constrained to use these column names, how would I define these models to make it workp

Negative 908 pAs you can see in the runnable code below, i try to have a Box with expandable childboxes. The children Boxes can change they size and this all works good. The main problem is that the size is always relative to the parent. But I want them to have a specific size and in case there is no place anymore use the JScrollPane. At the moment they shrink the other childrenboxes only.p  pI tried Glue and Filler, but it didnt work. The glue just had no effect and the filler had the side effect to keep always some place at the even when the ScrollPane is in action. That is pretty ugly to have there so much free space. p  pSo, do you know a good way to prevent the Boxes from stretching the children p  pThank you in advancep  precodeimport java.awt.Container import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener  import javax.swing.BorderFactory import javax.swing.Box import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JCheckBox import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JLabel import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.JTable import javax.swing.border.TitledBorder   public class ExpandableMenueDemo      Box allBoxes      ExpandableMenueDemo         allBoxes  Box.createVerticalBox          TitledBorder title         title  BorderFactory.createTitledBorderFilter         allBoxes.setBordertitle          for int i  0 ilt3i             generate collapsable components             SubBox b  new SubBoxSubBoxi             allBoxes.addb.getSwingBox                   allBoxes.addBox.createVerticalGlue           public Container getMenue         return allBoxes           public static void mainString[] args          JFrame frame  new JFrame         ExpandableMenueDemo m  new ExpandableMenueDemo         Box mainBox  Box.createHorizontalBox          mainBox.addnew JScrollPanem.getMenue         mainBox.addnew JTable20,5          frame.setContentPanemainBox         frame.pack         frame.setVisibletrue            class SubBox         Box box         Box header          String name          JButton cBtn         boolean isCollapsed  true         JLabel headerLine           SubBoxString name              this.name name             box  Box.createVerticalBox              headerLine  new JLabelname                header Box.createHorizontalBox             cBtn  new JButtonv             cBtn.addActionListenernew ActionListener                  Override                 public void actionPerformedActionEvent arg0                      if isCollapsedshow                     else collapse                                           collapse              header.addcBtn             header.addBox.createHorizontalStrut10             header.addheaderLine             header.addBox.createHorizontalGlue                    Box getSwingBox              Box b  Box.createVerticalBox                 b.addheader             b.addbox             return b                   public void collapse             System.out.printlncollapse             box.removeAll             this.isCollapsedtrue             cBtn.setTextv                   public void show             System.out.printlnshow             box.removeAll             this.isCollapsedfalse             cBtn.setText              for int i  0 ilt3i                  Box b  Box.createHorizontalBox                b.addBox.createHorizontalStrut20                b.addnew JCheckBoxcheckBox i                b.addBox.createHorizontalGlue                box.addb                             codepre

The code is based on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions158070jqueryhowtopositiononeelementrelativetoanotherjquery how to position one element relative to anothera But the code is not working as expected. I can figure out how to reposition the offset depending on the absolute positioning e.g. substract offset of header. But what I have trouble with is the scrolling positioning. As soon as you start scrolling the position is wrong. Does someone know a solution of itp
Negative 908 pI have a legacy build definition that was set up before I started my job that builds a solution file. Now, according to this a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails586358msbuildignoresprojectsectionprojectdependenciesinslnfileandattemptstobuildprojectsinwrongorder relnofollowarticlea, MSBuild completely ignores the build order set up for the solution so I have created a new build definition that builds the solutions project files in the correct order as per the solutions Build Order. Whilst this gets around my initial problem, it took a long time to set up the list of projects to build for my build definition as the solution has over 100 projects and entering all of these projects via the UI was a bit of a pain.p  pAn ideal solution to this issue would be if the build definition could reference an external file that holds this list of projects to build. This would also help me in the fact that the developers could also update this list with any newly added projects that need to be built with the correct building order too.p  pDoes anyone know if this is possible and if so how to achieve thisp
Negative 908 pI have quite many build projects in jenkins several projects with several branches each, I would like to enable them for promotion using the promotion plugin. p  pThe promotion process would be pretty much the same for all the different jobs. So I wouldnt like to write all the promotion steps in each of the build projects, but rather have a single promotion job, able to promote them. p  pThe way I see it a user would manually select and promote one build from either build project. the build would trigger a new build of the promotion job, which retrieves the information from the promoted build and does the promotion. p  pMy problem is that I dont seem to see a way to retrieve the artifacts from the promoted build. p  pIf I use the copy artifact plugin it forces me to choose an upstream job, and I seem not to be able to write more than one. The help says that I can use the  variables, but I dont see how, as I dont see the promoted build id among the environment variables.  p  pIm pretty sure this could be solved, but I dont see how.p  pAnyone has an idea p  pthanks. p

Negative 908 pBelow is reduced bit of code to demonstrate a problem I am a having. p  pI allocate and init a view controller. The init method is the standard Objective C init, so the view controller isnt doing anything yet. Then I create a navigationController initializing the root with the newly created view controller. I then release the view controller since the nav has it now and I dont need it. In the next line nav is released and I would expect that the view controllers deallocviewDidUnload would be called.  Instead they are not.  If I dont put the sportsViewController on the nav controller, dealloc is called after sportsViewController is released.

Negative 908 pemstrongEDITemstrong The format in the .csv excel file for the date was 15122011 and in the MySQL phpmyadmin database the column type was set to DATE so if I imported the file all data in date column changed to 00000000. I did the next to fix this, went into the .csv file and selected the column for date and changed the format to Africa so it would change everything from dmY to Ymd. So in the .csv it would become 20111215 instead of 15122011. After importing it again the date was correctly imported without turning to 00000000. p  pAfter that I Changed the ORDER BY in index.phpp  precodequery  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM newitems ORDER BY startVisible DESC LIMIT start, perpage codepre  pAfter that I changed the format date where was needed.p  precodeAvailable from ltphp                          timestamp  strtotimequeryrow[startVisible]                         echo datedmY, timestamp                         gt codepre  pThese scripts would first change the order by 1.year 2.month 3.day and after that change the format so it would echo 15122011 instead of 20111215 how it is saved in the databasep  pHope this will help others with the same problem.p  pCheers.p  pstrongbelow  question I askedstrongp  pI have exported a table and modified some things that needed to be modified. Next I tried to import them into the table again but codestartVisiblecode column Type was set to date. All my dates where stored as 00000000. All my dates in the csv file are like 15122011. Ive changed the column Type to varchar and after that I could import the csv file with everything as 15122011 I wanted to sort everything by date in www.domain.comindex.php. That is because the column type is not set to DATE. So I Changed the Column type from VARCHAR to DATE again and all the dates changed to 00000000. So no matter what I did everything changed to 00000000. I removed everything and imported the same file and all the dates where imported correctly. So it may be a MySQL load fail or something.p  pI usedp  precodequery  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM newItems ORDER BY startVisible DESC LIMIT start, perpage codepre  pBut all the dates are mixed now.

I want to put the name and time of the last person prevously to access that record onto the client page each time that record is retrieved. p  pThey are saying that the performance implications of this will be high but based on my reasonable but not expert knowledge of how B trees work, this doesnt seem right even if the table is very large.   p  pIf you create an index on the GUID of the client record and the datetime of access descending, then you ought to be able to retrieve the required record via an index scan which would just need to find the first entry for that GUID and then stop  And that with a btree index, most of the index would be cached so the number of physical disc accesses needed would be very small and the query time therefore significantly less than 1s.    p  pOr have I got this completely wrongp

Negative 908 pWe are working on a third party integration using WSDLs and XSDs that were provided to us.  Weve used svcutil to generate all the proxy classes for us which works fine.  When we test with SoapUi everything works fine, however, when we try to send the response to our partner theyre rejecting the SOAP message because the namespaces are being defined in the message header and body rather than the SOAP envelope.p  pUnfortunately, I cant make our partner change their process to accept our messages even though I believe they are technically correct since we are defining the namespaces before we use them in the XML, just not where they expect them.  I know I could put a message inspector in to massage the SOAP message before goes out, but Id rather not go to that level of processing.p  pAre there any settings either for svcutil or even on the serialization attributes that we could set to have WCF output the namespaces on the envelope insteadp  pemWhat they wantemp  precodeltsEnvelope xmlnsshttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope xmlnshhttptheirdomain.orgservicegt   ltsHeadergt     lthmyTypegt       ltversiongtV1.0ltversiongt     lthmyTypegt   ltsHeadergt   ltsBodygt     lthsomeElement gt   ltsBodygt ltsEnvelopegt codepre  pemWhat were sendingemp  precodeltsEnvelope xmlnsshttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope gt   ltsHeadergt     lthmyType xmlnshhttptheirdomain.orgservicegt       ltversiongtV1.0ltversiongt     lthmyTypegt   ltsHeadergt   ltsBodygt     lthsomeElement xmlnshhttptheirdomain.orgservicegt   ltsBodygt ltsEnvelopegt codepre

I have a split view and left and right views are both table views. In left I show some categories and on based on selection in left I configure the view in right. Configuration first deletes the cache and then changes the predicate of NSFetchedResultsController and then do performFetch on that. In background I find updated objects for the selected category and either insert new objects or update existing ones. Now adding new objects dont show up automatically in table view and updating objects is causing a delete. I update categories in left table view from a different NSFetchedResultsController and that works fine. Both NSFetchedResultsController use different cache file. If I dont change predicate then everything works fine with objects from all the categories. Predicate is to fetch records from selected category.p

Negative 908 pI have an existing application with a new requirement to show an image in a DataGridView cell to denote whether the record has a specific flag associated with it or not not user editable, this comes from the DB.p  pIf there is a flag, I show the corresponding image, and if theres no flag, I want nothing to be shown in the column.p  pThe DataGridView columns werent created in Visual Studio designer, or else this would easy.

Instead the columns are created at runtime when all the data is loaded into a DataTable, and then a DataView is created from that DataTable, and then the DataGridViews Datasource is set to the DataView.p  pI cant completely rewrite this, or else Id just define the columns in VS Designer instead of this ridiculous way of just letting the columns be defined from the DataTable.  p  pMy question is then, how can I make it so the column with the Images shows nothing when the underlying data table has a nullp  pHeres some pseudo C to demonstrate what I mean.

Negative 908 pI have a program selection tool that i made. it opens a JFrame with 17 buttons, 15 of which are customizable, and they get their text from a .txt document located in the C drive. when i click the assign button, it opens a JFileChooser to select a file to open when the button is clicked. You then select a button to change, and then type the text you want displayed by the button. After that the program rewrites the .txt file and updates the buttons. here is the code for updatingp  precodepublic static void restart      start.assignButtonActions     start.assignButtonText     start.paintgraphics  public void assignButtonActions             assign button actions           for int i  0 i lt buttonAction.length i          buttonAction[i]  io.readSpecificFromHDCButtonActions.txt, i                  1  actionButton.length        public void assignButtonText      for int i  0 i lt actionButton.length i                     set button text                   actionButton[i].setTextio.readSpecificFromHD                 CButtonActions.txt, i  1        public void paintGraphics g      g.drawImagegetImagefilesbackground.png, 0, 0, FRAMEWIDTH,             FRAMEHEIGHT, null     refresh   public void refresh      graphics.drawImagegetImagefilesbackground.png, 0, 0, FRAMEWIDTH,             FRAMEHEIGHT, null     for int i  0 i lt actionButton.length i          actionButton[i].repaint          assignButton.repaint     helpButton.repaint  codepre  pThats all the code that is required for this question i believe. The problem is, after the method coderestartcode is called, the background is there, with a white square around the buttons, with it being white inside the square. not really a major problem, but really incredibly annoying and pretty unprofessional. At first i thought it was that the buttons were resizing after the background is painted, so i made it so that the refresh runs twice each time its called. didnt help one bit. p  pEDIT I fixed the problem. I took hovercrafts answer and modified what i learned a little bit. all i had to do was modify the coderestartcode method top  precodepublic static void restart      start.assignButtonActions     start.assignButtonText     start.repaint  codepre  pbecause the coderepaintcode repaint the whole component which was what hovercraft said.

Negative 908 pI have a data access layer that is compiled as a class library and compiles to a dll. Historically, the dll provided data access to my database for my web application. It works just fine, but what its doing is it is pulling my connection string from the web.config. This is fine too, but now I want to use this data dll in a Windows Form application. Is there a way for the DLL to know if its running inside a web application or winform application and to appropriately pull the connection string from either the web.config or app.config filep

Using the HTML and CSS as shown above. Now, I also want to fix the header so that it does not move. Basically, only my content section should scroll. However, if I add a positionfixed to the header, my mainimage and content now sit on top of my header. If I add a margintop150px since my header height is 150px to the mainimage, it works fine and moves down appropriately. However if I add a margintop150px to the content, my header moves down by 150px and still sits on top of my content. Can someone please explain why this is happening Thanks in Advance p

How can i do that,im confused from my searching so far.p  pSecond questionHow can i delete only the eventsand their reminders made from my application,so when i sync my drug therapy to delete all previous events and produce new events based on the new drug therapy i receive from my servicep

Negative 908 pI have an Android app that crashes on some devices with a NullPointerException inside my implementation of dispatchTouchEvent. Ive never actually seen the crash happen on any of my devices, but it happens many times a day in the field, because I see crashes both in my own analytics and in the Android Developer console. The problem is that I am having a hard time figuring out how this crash can possibly be happening. Heres the relevant code I marked the place in the code where the NullPointerException is thrown by CRASH HERE p  precodeif       ...  else if event  null      if event.getAction  MotionEvent.ACTIONDOWN          motionStartX  event.getX         motionStartY  event.getY          else if event.getAction  MotionEvent.ACTIONUP              ...         if ...                      ...                  else if         event  null ampamp event.getPointerCount gt 0 ampamp   CRASH HERE gt Math.absmotionStartX  event.getX gt 5                           Math.absmotionStartY  event.getY gt 5                      ...                codepre  pFrom my understanding, the only way a NullPointerException could be thrown there is if codeeventcode is codenullcode, however, on the line just above it I added some paranoid checks for codeeventcode being codenullcode and even that the event has pointers. Still, Im getting crashes. I feel like Im missing something. Does anyone have any insight into thisp
Negative 908 pIve integrated the facebook login in a site which seems to be the source of some trouble.p  pWhenever I log in with the regular way by an self created field there is no problem, but once I use a facebook login the divs of the site are getting messed up. p  pIve got a wrapper with a width of 90 of the page, inside this div there are two divs one named content with 80 of the width of the wrapper and the other once receives the other 20 of the width.p  precodeltdiv idwrappergt     ltdiv idcontentgt         content here...     ltdivgt     ltdiv idsidebargt         side bar items etc.     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pNow if I press kbdF12kbd to check the source  inspect elements of the site it shows up perfectly with the regular login.

Negative 908 pI am working on a command processing application which uses azure service bus queue. Commands are issued from a website and posted to the queue and the queue messages are processed by a worker role. Processing involves fetching data from db and other sources based on the queue message values and sending it to different topics. The flow is ,p  ol liReceive messageli liprocess the messageli liMark message as complete  Abandon message On processing exception.li ol  pThe challenge I face here is the processing time. Sometimes it exceeds the maximum message lock time period 5 minutes configured and hence the message is unlocked and it reappears for the worker role to pick up consider multiple instances of the worker role. So this causes same message to be processed again. p  pWhat are the options I have to handle such a scenario.p  pI have thought about ,p  ol lipReceive message  add to a local variable  mark message complete. In case of exception send the message again to the queue or to a separate queue let us say failed message queue. A second queue also means another worker role to process it.pli lipIn the processing there is a foreach loop that runs. So I thought of using a Parallel.Foreach instead . but not sure how much of time gain it will give and also read some posts on issues when using Parallel in azure.pli ol  pSuggestions,fixes welcome.p

If I dont care about elements physically appearing smaller on device 2, what would be the approach to just physically scale my layouts to fit on device 2p  pJust copying the drawablemdpi to drawablehdpi helps a little bit, but there are still problems. Are the absolute dp margins in the layout the problem Should they be replaced by pixel dependent ones and everything is OKp  pIn general, what are best practices when I want to use a design that was originally created for a specific pixel resolution on devices with different pixel resolutions and I dont care much about elements appearing smaller or biggerp  pIn my case I basically just want to scale the original design and I dont care much about the vertical size because the main view is scrollable anyway.p

Negative 908 pI keep getting a linker error trying to get GLEW to work in VS2012. I have searched online, and none of the solutions worked.p  pTo set up, I added codeglewincludecode to VC Include Directories, and codeglewlibcode to VC Library Directories.

This solution also failed to work.p  pMy code goes as followsp  precodepragma commentlib, glew32.lib  include ltGLglew.hgt  int main     glewInit  codepre  pThats it.

Negative 908 pIm building an application with KnockoutJS with a component that essentially acts as a sequential spreadsheet.  On different lines users may define variables or use them to represent a value.p  pSo for examplep  precodex 2  x  2 x  4 x  4 codepre  pI have this working in the straightforward case of continuing adding new lines.  The output function for each line checks and iterates backwards to see if the variable was ever defined previously.  If it was it uses the first example it finds and sets that as the value.  This works when initially defining the lines, and also works when you edit a line after a previous line has changed.p  pHowever, I would like variables to update if a previous definition of that variable has changed, been removed, or been added.   That behavior does not exist right now.   I have tried adding my own custom dependency handling code using a map to track the variables, but it badly impacted performance.  I would like to tap into Knockouts dependency management to solve this, but Im not sure of the best way to do so.  Here is a brief summary of my code structure, I would be happy to add more detail if needed.p  pcodecalcFrameworkcode is the viewmodel object I bind to the map.  It consists of an observable list of Lines, a varMap, and other unrelated properties and functionsp  pcodeLinecode is a custom object.  The relevant code is belowp  precodevar Line  function linenum,currline      var self  this     self.varMap       self.input  ko.observable     self.linenum  ko.observablelinenum       self.lnOutput  ko.computed         readfunction            return outputFunctionself,self.input         ,         writefunction,         ownerself        function  outputFunctionself,input      try         var out  EQParser.parseinput,10,self         return  out.toString          catchex         error handling        Line.prototype.getVar  function varName, notCurrentLine      iftypeof varName  undefined         return null          Actually dont want ones set in the current varMap, only past lines     ifvarName in this.varMap ampamp notCurrentLine         return this.varMap[varName]           if this.linenum gt 0          var nextLine  calcFramework.lines[this.linenum  1]         return nextLine.getVarvarName,true      else          eventually go to global         return calcFramework.varMap[varName]        Line.prototype.setVar  functionvarName,value     this.varMap[varName]  value  codepre  pSetVar and getVar are passed to eqParser, which gets the value of the expression, calling those functions as needed if a variable is referenced.  So the variable value is not explicitly passed to the function and thus knockout does not view it as a dependency.  But Im not sure how I would pass the variable as a parameter without traversing the list every time.p  pSo my question is, given this setup, what is the best way to track changes to a variable assignment andor new assignments and update the lines that reference that variable, while maintaining good performance. p  pI recognize my question is lengthy and I have attempted to trim out all unnecessary detail.  Thanks for your patience in reading.p

We have users that have access to certain files.p  pWhen we display different view of files or objects associated to files we need filter the view depending on the logged in users access to files. If every view requires the application to run through all files I guess it is bad for peformance.

Negative 908 pI am trying to show a custom dialog box from the Google Maps through the Google Maps Android API v2 once a custom marker from the map was clicked. The custom marker will show the current traffic condition in the location where it was placed. The custom Dialog contains the name of the place, the current northbound and southbound traffic condition of the road, some advisory if available like, road is under construction, etc., and the time when the traffic was updated. All these data came from an XML file and was stored in the sqlite database. My problem now is, when I click on any of the markers, it only shows the Dialog of the first data in the query. I know that my query was right because the markers contains the right icons with regards to traffic condition. I guess the problem is only on the looping process. I also tried using for loop but the same output was generated. Can anyone help me to achieve my goal Any help or suggestion will be greatly appreciated.

Negative 908 pI have my own database which Im running using Xampp. Im using the Apache and MySql services on it, though I given public access just yet. I would like to know the proper way to end a bunch of sql queries. Im using ajax to send data to a php page and query some data from a server. During the ajax requests the I programmed the handler php page so it will be performing multiple queries at least more than one to get the specific data I need. Now, I dont know when in the process I should use codemysqlikillcode or codemysqliclosecode. I have it set up right now so only after all the immediate queries for that particular ajax request have been performed, then run mysqliclose. I dont even use mysqlikill. I dont know too much about database connections or managing performance on a server so I dont know stronghowstrong to consider this. On one hand, I dont need to close the connection until that user logs off the webpage, right Or should I just open and close each connection as it comes and is processedp  pThis handler php page processes requests from a few webpages I have and in one of the webpages there is an input box that sends ajax requests every keystroke to show hints possible matches... also note this is an employee access only page so connections shouldnt be too high. p  pI also took a look at this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4506632couldsomeoneexplainalittleaboutthisstatementaboutmysqliclosefunctionCould someone explain a little about this statement about mysqli close functionap  pThe answer is contradictory to the suggestion taken from the php manual website.

Negative 908 pI need to mirror a UIWebViews CALayers to a smaller CALayer. The smaller CALayer is essentially a pip of the larger UIWebView. Im having difficulty in doing this.

So I need a way of knowing when the CALayer or child CALayers become dirty.p  pI cannot simply have two UIWebViews because two pages may be different timing is off, different background, etc....

I also cannot display the entire iPad screen as there are other elements on the screen that should not show on the external screen.p  pBoth the larger CALayer and smaller pip CALayer need to match smoothly frameforframe in iOS 6.

Negative 908 pI really couldnt find anything useful.

Negative 908 pIve created a slide show with canvas, and Im using a clip to round the edges of the images in it. Because the clip does not fade out, I stroke the clip path before calling clip to smooth the outer edges, then stroke it again after drawing an image to smooth the inner edges. This worked flawlessly in chrome, but testing in safari or internet explorer led to the problems shown a hrefhttpi.imgur.comV93Osfs.jpg relnofollowherea. The image on the left is chrome, the image on the right is safari. Notice the gap between the line and the edge of the image.  p  pThe path that I stroke is the exact same path as the clip path, and the lineWidth is 5, but it looks like safari is not filling in the pixels right at the border of the clip. Is there a way I can fix this without creating an overlay image with the outlinep  pEDIT 2 I tried removing the clip with restore, drawing the outline, and reclipping.

Negative 908 pI have problem with socket communication   SIP server and android devices. I cant send SIP packet over TCP  bigger than 800 bytes.If the packet is lt 800 bytes everything is OK. There is a successful TCP handshake established before try to send SIP packet and still nothing. I send the data like this wayp  precodeSocket socket  new Socketip,port OutputStream out new OutputStreamsocket.getOutputStream  out.flush   out.writemsg   codepre  pThere is no problem with send function. Strange thing is that some packets are delivered to server minutes after being send from devices for SIP packets  800 bytes. If we try to send other data not SIP with size of packet  800 bytes everything is OK and server receives it. The problem is only with SIP packets   800 bytes. This problem happens not for all android devices. For example Galaxy s plus  problem. Nexus 4  problem.  Nexus s  no problem.                                                                                                                and etc. The issue is resolved if I split the SIP packet at two parts, however I would like to find out why SIP data isnt flushed and other data is sent immediately. There shouldnt be any difference.p
Negative 908 pI have been trying to install the MSVAD virtual audio sample drivers from the Windows DDK on Windows 7 64bits, without success. I modified the sample INF to only support the simple driver. The ChkInf tool confirms that everything is OK with the INF file, I signed the package with a Test certificate. So far, so good. The problem is despite reading the documentation on the Microsoft website, I have no clue of how to actually install this driver. The problem is that it does not match a physical device, so I cant use the Device Manager to update the driver on an existing device. Aside from that, the rightclick on INF  Install method does not work as the INF lacks a DefaultInstall section which is a requirement for signing drivers.p  pI would like to be able to install this driver from the commandline ideally, but if a specific program is required, Ill have to go that way.p  pThanks in advance for any clue on how to solve this.p

Negative 908 pBackground first, strongPROBLEMstrong in boldp  pI am a student and for a summer research project, I am going to write a Java program that lets me export data collected from research hardware into MATLAB in the Windows environment I dont need the program to be portable to other platforms.  I have a thirdparty DLL with a great API containing CC declarations, but I dont have access to the source code for the DLL.p  pI only know Java, so after looking at the available options, I decided to use JNA because it seemed easiest and most straightforward to use, plus, JNA is currently maintained.  I asked a friend who knows C make an example DLL for me so I could start at the bottom and make a hello world style test of loading the library and accessing native methods using JNA.  I followed examples from a hrefhttptutortutor.cacgibinmakepage.cgiarticlesrjna relnofollowherea and read about a hundred responses to other peoples questions by twall andor technomage.p  pAfter working around some UnsatisfiedLinkErrors due to jna.library.path starting as emnullem, I recompiled the 32bit example DLL given to me into 64bit, and threw them both into the bin folder, and I let the program determine which one to access, depending on the JVM running.  I know I wont be able to do this with my third party DLL, which is 32bit, but this is just part of my proof of concept phase.p  pstrongI have been able to access the DLL methods easily enough, but I am seeing output all print statements in an unexpected order.  What it looks like is that my Java code is executing start to finish, then the native library start to finishstrongp  pLater in my project, I will need to call native functions, then java methods, then native functions again, so I need to understand what is causing this odd sequence early on.  I tried a very procedural approach at first below is my attempt to dress the methods up as objects I can manipulate, which yielded the same results. I am guessing it has to do with HOW the JVM and the native side of the house interact, or the differences in the way windows and Java handle IO, but I am stumped on what is causing it, or how to approach the issue.p  pMy setup looks like this  CallFooPortably.javap  precodepublic class CallFooPortably  name taken from a tutorial, thanks     public static void mainString[] args

Negative 908 pI have a web page, clicking a button it updates a textbox T1 on the page locally via jquery and then aspnet server gets the submit, makes a Csharp process and open another href response.redirect  on the same page.p  pThe problem is that, going back with browser back button, IE and Chrome give you T1 with the same values written before,  while Firefox gives ALWAYS T1 empty. Cannot understand why.p  pHas anybody ever encountered this. I have isolated all the process, so the button writes the textbox and calls the other page, no postback, no aspnet. An alert after the update T1 reads again T1 to verify it is written. But after BACK button its again empty.p  pThanks....Savp

Negative 908 pI have written a python program that solves Sudoku and want to make it faster. The core operation is a depth first search function which I implement as recursion. I thought I could eliminate the recursion overhead by rewriting the depth first search procedure as a loop which manages a data stack simply a list but it turns out that performance is not significantly different. I am pretty sure that the loop version is procedurally equivalent to the recursive version. Is it because the data stack I use is not fast in pushingpopping Or python interpreter really makes very good use of hardware Can someone help me figure out what can be done  Profiling is attached. p  psearchnaked is the recursive function.p  precode                      2446265 function calls 1813295 primitive calls in 4.576 seconds     Ordered by internal time, cumulative time    List reduced from 31 to 20 due to restriction lt20gt     ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filenamelinenofunction 70925579779    2.136    0.000    2.136    0.000 sdkx.py251searchnaked      3514    1.539    0.000    3.994    0.001 sdkx.py106propagate   351420    0.239    0.000    4.389    0.219 sdkx.py234dfs        20    0.135    0.007    4.528    0.226 sdkx.py468solvestring      3901    0.098    0.000    0.113    0.000 sdkx.py82Assume    467283    0.071    0.000    0.071    0.000 method add of set objects      3514    0.050    0.000    0.050    0.000 method copy of dict objects    378200    0.048    0.000    0.048    0.000 method discard of set objects         1    0.047    0.047    4.576    4.576 sdkx.py487solvefile codepre  pAnd here is the loop counterpart  searchnaked3p  precode         2825303 function calls 2821809 primitive calls in 4.367 seconds     Ordered by internal time, cumulative time    List reduced from 32 to 20 due to restriction lt20gt     ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filenamelinenofunction    144657    1.967    0.000    2.154    0.000 sdkx.py148searchnaked3      3514    1.285    0.000    3.760    0.001 sdkx.py106propagate   351420    0.240    0.000    4.156    0.208 sdkx.py221dfs    443513    0.114    0.000    0.114    0.000 method pop of list objects        20    0.109    0.005    4.269    0.213 sdkx.py455solvestring         1    0.097    0.097    4.367    4.367 sdkx.py474solvefile      3901    0.096    0.000    0.112    0.000 sdkx.py82Assume    467283    0.072    0.000    0.072    0.000 method add of set objects codepre  p[Edit] Here attached the two functions.p  precodedef searchnakedLs, LsL, Tmask, D, NLID,N, locs, masks  Find the smallest naked subgroup.     global naked, nakedmask, Msize     LsL1, K   LsL1, LsLN     for nextLID in xrangeNLID, N         Tmask1   Tmaskmasks[nextLID]         D1dcounter[Tmask1]         if LsL1D1             if D1 ltN                 return Lslocs[nextLID], Tmask1, D1             return 0,0,0         if LsL1gtD1             return False         if D1nextLID gt K or D1gtMsize              continue         result  searchnakedLslocs[nextLID], LsL1, Tmask1, D1, nextLID1,N, locs, masks         if result0,0,0             return result       return 0,0,0    def searchnaked3locs, masks, N  Find a subgroup in a deep first manner without recussion. counter is the stack for DFS purpose.      counter, i, Len, bm,K  [],0, 1,0,N1     i the current index of a cell to be augmentally considered and checked with for subgroup.     bm base mask is the ORed value of previously selected masks, this is used with the current cell to generate a new mask for checking purpose     counter the stack structure storing i,bm pairs, which are used when returning from DFS     Len this is a derived value, as lencounter1, Len is maintained to avoid calling len function.

Negative 908 pI have a WebApi application and i am working on some POSTPUT methods and i am trying to figure out the optimal way of updating a record in the database using entity framework.p  pThe main issue with using WebApi is the request will only have a subset of the full properties of the full object.p  pFor instance, i have a codeSitecode object that has a codeProjectcode navigation object that points to the related project.  As currently sites cannot move projects, i dont supply the projectId with the PUT command meaning that codeProjectcode object of codeSitecode is empty, which causes issues when trying to update even when stating that that property is not modified, so i have been forced to reading the record first and then merging the changes and then persisting, likep  pstrongClarity for the example below, site is the object passed as a parameter to the PUT route so in this case is the partial Site objectstrongp  precodeGrab the existing site var dbSite  from s in repo                        where s.Id  id                        select s.FirstOrDefault  Update unchanged values site.Id  id site.CreatedOn  dbSite.CreatedOn  var entry  uow.EntrydbSite entry.Propertye gt e.Code.IsModified  true entry.Propertye gt e.Active.IsModified  true entry.Propertye gt e.CreatedOn.IsModified  false  uow.EntrydbSite.CurrentValues.SetValuessite  Commit uow.Commit codepre  pIs there a way with taking a partial object without certain navigation properties set and updating the database without loading it first, or is the best approach loading it and updating the way i am doing it currentlyp

Negative 908 pI am working on a project using the bootstrap and in starting the fixed navigation on top I have found that it is hiding the links ie. Home, Account, Logoff, presumably collapsing them. Because when i shrink it down and get the toggle it will display them after i initiate it.  When I remove the .collapse from just below the first comment it displays the links. However then it will not collapse on resizing. How do I get the top nav links to show and still have the toggle work Note All of the file paths to the css and js are correct directoriesp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt       ltheadgt     lttitlegtprojectlttitlegt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1.0gt     ltlink hrefcssbootstrap.min.css relstylesheet mediascreengt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltnav classnavbar navbardefault rolenavigationgt       ltdiv classnavbarheadergt     ltbutton typebutton classnavbartoggle datatogglecollapse datatarget.navbarex1collapsegt       ltspan classiconbargtltspangt       ltspan classiconbargtltspangt       ltspan classiconbargtltspangt     ltbuttongt     lta classnavbarbrand hrefgtBrandltagt       ltdivgt        lt Problem is here gt       ltdiv classcollapse navbarcollapse navbarex1collapsegt         ltul classnav navbarnavgt           ltli classactivegtlta hrefgtHomeltagtltligt           ltligtlta hrefgtAccountltagtltligt       ltligtlta hrefgtLogoutltagtltligt     ltulgt       ltdivgtlt .navbarcollapse gt     ltnavgt     lth1gtHello, worldlth1gt     ltscript srcjsjquery.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcjsbootstrap.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 908 pI am using Cloudinarys javascript  node.js library to generate resized images using various methods scale, crop, fit, etc.p  pThe library returns a url based on the transformation options specified, BUT p  pI dont know the size of the image until it has been loaded, and because the images are usercreated content, and can be different aspect ratios or smaller than the maximum size displayed, the size wont necessarily be what Ive specified in the options.p  pWhile you can use an codeimgcode tag with just codesrccode and codealtcode values, you should really also specify codewidthcode and codeheightcode, or it can slow down the rendering of the HTML page either waiting for the image to load before layout or recalaulting layout when images are loaded, depending on the browser and other factors.p  pSince Cloudinary knows the original image dimensions and the algorithm used to generate the resized image, it makes sense that the final width and height of a resized image are possible to detect, but I cant work out how to do so using any of the libraries available.p  pIs there a feature Ive missed, library that exists, or example where this has been donep

Negative 908 pI want to abstract the details of specifying an EntityManager from the majority of the implementation, so Ive put the codePersistenceContext... EntityManager emcode declaration in a codeSingletoncode bean.  That bean has a codegetEmcode method which the rest of the app uses to get the EntityManager there are actually several EntityManagers, all done this same way. Each codeStatelesscode bean that does  JPArelated ops injects the codeSingletoncode bean, and then calls the codegetEmcode method to get the EntityManager.p  pThere are three primary reasons for this approach 1 keep the specification of codeunitNamecode in the codePersistenceContextcode declaration in one place i.e., avoiding repeated injections of codePersistenceContextcode repeating the codeunitNamecode 2 keep options open to change acquisition of the EntityManager from being injected to JNDI lookup later on 3 when using multiple entity managers in a livestandby scenario, allow some logic to dynamically determine the proper one.p  pFew questionsp  ol liIs this approach inherently flawed  If so, is there a better way to accomplish the 3 objectives listedli liWhen acquiring the EntityManager in this way when injected into the codeSingletoncode, will each codeStatelesscode bean get a fresh EntityManager for every transaction containermanaged transactions.  Or do I need to do something specific to prevent the EntityManager the codeStatelesscode bean is [re]using from becoming staleli liSame as 2 for JNDI lookup in the codeSingletoncode.li liIf each transaction isnt getting a fresh EntityManager presumably due to some JPAJTA interactions, then I suspect this approach isnt threadsafe due to multiple codeStatelesscode acquisition of single EntityManager from codeSingletoncode. Any approaches to address thatli ol

In this scenario testng is essentially the framework, and provides very little flexibility.p  pI have read up on Robot Framework, still very new to it, and would like to move our testing model to a acceptance testing and acceptance testdriven development. And it looks like robot framework supports a englishwrittentestcase.txt and turns it into an actual test it runs, and reports back the result in an output.xml type of file.p  pSo, I was wondering is there any way, for robot framework to handle just the code the .java files and run through the testcases without, me having to go back and write .txt files in order to kick off the testcases.p  pAnd afterwards have it report back with some sort of output.xml report.p  pBasically, I need the ability to keep things working as currently, but at the same time allow me to slowly transition to the testcase.txt file model that robot framework can offer.p
Negative 908 pI have to create a dll to enable legacy clients to continue to use COM to access the middle tier.  The new middle tier uses WCF.net 4.5, so I will be exposing a .net 4.5 dll via COM.p  pMy question is how to return errorswhat to return when an error occurs.  I am finding very little information about this.  There is currently no errorhandling in the existing clients that I can find, so I cant use that as a benchmark.  p  pCan I just use the standard trycatch approach, throw a .net error, and let the client sort it out, or is there something more I need to do to enable error handling in this kind of scenariop
Negative 908 pMy intention is to have a map that contains multiple markers on different countries. The markers are connected each others. The countriesregions will have different colors based the numbers data related to each of those.  Then, i have done with a simple map using Gmaps and managed to plot the markers and then connected each marker to others with customized curved line. I was using a hrefhttpcurvedlines.overfx.net relnofollowthis librarya.p  pYet now im facing one more trouble how to deal with different colors for each country based on the numbers data related to each of those Here i have an array containing the countries and numbers related t each of those and i want to differentiate the colors between those countries with smaller number results lighter color and bigger number results darker.p  pI have found a hrefhttpsgoogledevelopers.appspot.comchartinteractivedocsgallerygeochart relnofollowGoogle Geo Charta that makes it easy to implement and looks very beautiful. But how can i combine this advantage with the map i have made using Gmaps and the lines inside I need a solutionp

Negative 908 pIm loading a large amount of files binary data into a Postgres database the files being stored as blobs in the db.p  pOne way I found was to use Large Objects, which works nicely. However, for various reasons I would like to explore the possibility of storing the file contents directly in a bytea field.  Now, the Large Object managers allows me to directly write chunks of bytes directly into its buffer, eliminating the need to first load the whole file into memory. p  pThis is rather important for me as im loading the files with several threads working in parallel and the GC just cant keep up if all threads are simultaneously loading whole files in to memory.  p  pIs there any way I could do this with a bytea parameter I was thinking of an SQL function which appends a chunk of bytes to the bytea field of a row. Then I can just call this function repeatedly for a blob. Im rather new to PostgreSQL so I really could do with a hint how such a SQL function could look like.p  pSo, how do I append to a bytea blob in PostgreSQL p  pBTW, alternative ideas are also appreciated.p  pIm using PostgreSQL 9.3, C .NET 4, and the NpgSql Postgres Data provider, the files blobs can be everything from a few kb to several mb.p  pEdit Ive seen references to a codebyteacatcode function, seems promising but I cant find an example on how I should use it.p  pEdit2 In the end it really seems to be easiest to just load the blobs as single parameters in a query... just as long as one makes sure that they are garbage collected fast enough e.g. not making the byte arrays a property of an object. Postgresql handles the data very nicelyp

Negative 908 pPLEASE,p  pI know this question has been asked many times, but I still cant get my code to work.p  pI have a text file in my assets folder called words.txt. There is one word per line in each line of that text file with no blank lines. I want to put every word in an array. p  pFirst I tried using scanner, but after reading many stackoverflow threads I found out I needed to use AssetManager.p  pHeres what I triedp  precodeAssetManager assetManager  getAssets InputStream inputStream  assetManager.openwords.txt codepre  pIt gives me the error message codedefault constructor cannot handle exception type IOException thrown by implicit super constructor...code before I even do anything else. I dont know what this means. p  pAlso, looking at the api, it seems like InputStream can only read bytes. How can I read words from the text filep  pThe threads are overwhelming because it seems like each answer proposes a different method, using InputStreams, BufferedStreams, FileInputStreams, File, Res folders, Asset folders, and lots of other language I am unfamiliar with.

Negative 908 pIm constructing a pipeline using TPL Dataflow. Say I have a pipeline that consists of four TransformBlocksp  precodeGetDataFromDatabase ProcessData1 ProcessData2 SendDataToRestService codepre  pEach of these may probably will be a long running operation. GetDataFromDatabase will probably mostly be waiting for the database to respond, SendDataToRestService be waiting for the service to response. ProcessData 1 and 2 will be long running local, CPU intense processes.p  pNow, my intention was to set maxdegreeofparalellism on each of my blocks to the number of cores on the machine which will probably be 4.p  pBut it occurs to me that that means that it will do 4 GetDataFromDatabases at once, and 4 ProcessData1 at once, and 4 ProcessData2 at once, and 4 SendDataToRestService at once. Which would mean I could potentially have 16 threads running at the same time. Add to this that I actually have 3 different flows doing similar stuff at the same time.p  pQUESTION Whats the best approach to this, so that I get the best performance From what Ive read, if I try to do too much, I can actually slow down performance due to context switching. Is there a best approach, or is it suck it and seep

Negative 908 pTLDR Would a real server Apache Flask Django be able to unify various services behind readable subdirectories abc.work.comsvn, abc.work.comhg instead of using port numbers abc.work.com8000, abs.work.com8001p  pLong Version In the last year Ive learned how to serve files with Mongoose, run a minimal python webserver, host version control repositories with Subversion and Mercurial, and host a Trac issue trackerproject management framework.p  pIn each case Ive been using the easy builtin webserver provided by each tool to host it from my Windows 7 laptop at work Im an engineer who codes, not actually paid to be a software guy.  In order to avoid clashing Ive used different port numbers in the 8000 range for each server to listen on, and sent my coworkers links like a hrefhttpmachinename.domain.com8042 relnofollowhttpmachinename.domain.com8042a to access these magical things Ive created.p  pThe first obvious problem is that Im running a lot of these things out of a command prompt and just letting it sit open on my desktop.  I also know how to call cmd.exe from VBScript in order to hide the command prompt if thats all I wanted.  Many of the builtin webservers even have options to run as a service, which can get harry with permissions, but is closer to the right way to host a server of any kind. p  pThe bigger problem is that Im sending people links to my machine with different port numbers.  Im ok with them having to use my machine name  I assume Id need the network admin folks to add a DNS entry to call it TeamAwesome.company.com instead of machinename.company.com8000p  pThe bigger question is, if I did something fancy like an Apache, Django, or Flask webserver, could I set it up like machinename.company.comtrac for the trac server and machinename.company.comhgproject1 for the HG repository for project1  Im looking at Apache, Django, and Flask because Ive been diving into Python for 2 years now and those appear the most applicableapproachable for my needs.p  pI understand that ideally this stuff should be hosted on a separate linuxy server machine, but Ill need to prove the usefulness of the tools Im developing before I request server resources from my boss who hired me to do engineering, not programming, or web development, or systems administration, etc..p  pI see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9332865howshouldiorganizemultipleexpressserversonthesamesystemthisa looks related.

Negative 908 pSince I started to study OOP encapsulation was always something that raised questions to me. Getters and setters in 99 of the cases seemed like a big lie what does it matter to have setter if it changes the reference of the private field, and getter that returns reference to mutable object Of course there are many things that make life easier with getters and setters pattern like Hibernate that creates proxies on entities. In Scala there is some kind of solution dont lie to yourself, if your field is codevalcode you have nothing to fear of and just make it public. Still this doesnt solve the question of methods, should I ever declare a method private in Scala Why would I declare a method private in Java Mostly if its a helper method and I dont want to pollute my class namespace, and if the method changes our internal state. The second issue doesnt apply mostly amp hopefully to Scala, and the first one could be simply solved with appropriate traits. So when would I want to declare a method private in Scala What is the convention for encapsulation in Scala I would highly appreciate if you help me to order my thoughts on subject.p

Negative 908 pone of the reasons I am so comfortable withe excel is the ease in which I can pass a range of values, or an array, and use one or more of those values in a calculation.p  pFor example say I had the array [1, 2, 1, 5, 7, 10, 6, 20, 12, 7, 4]p  pI might want to calculatep  ol lipThe number of continuous up or down sequences, for example 12 would be 1 up because 2 is higher than 1. pli lipIn the case of 5, 7, 10 I would like to count this up sequence as 2, 5 to 7 and 7 to 10pli lipI would also like to count the range or values which actually contributed to the sequence, and where they occured, for example even though 6 to 10 is only 1 continuous up, it is significant because of the fact that the move is 14 206. In terms of when the sequence occurred, I would like to record the array index position, or a date which may be attached to the number in another column.pli ol  pUsing excel, I would pass this array to a function, and say if Element0  element1 move to element 2, and 3 and so on, and then when I record that the value drops in the negative direction I sum those values. p  pOr if I was doing it in terms of cells, I could say if active cell value is negative, sum the two before it using .offset.p  pHowever I am not sure how to get two or more values from a row or column using pandas in the same way I would do it using offsetp  pmany Thanks, Josh.p  pstrongUpdate  Thanks guys for your update, I will add more detailstrongp  ol liBasically Each Product has a set of values, and I have multiple products, where the product is in one column, and associated with the product are multiple numbers which refer to price.

For example products C, D and E lets say the dates for prices of products C, D and E were 20140101,20140102, and 20140103. These products showed 3 up movements in a row, and the values were 1, 5, 7.

I may then see a pattern such that the product doesnt change in price often, but when it does it jumps a large amount. Or I could see the by summing the changes in price, that a products price alternates most often dropping 3 points and then raising 3 points, and so it is cyclical.li liLastly I would like to see when the prices moved 3 points the dates and what values the prices were when the movement occurred, 1, 5, 7.li ul

Specifically, I would like to turn thisp  precodefactor.A factor.B success.count fail.count      0        1        0             2  1        1        2             1 codepre  pinto thisp  precodefactor.A factor.B result      0        1        0  0        1        0  1        1        1  1        1        1  1        1        0 codepre  pIt seems to me that codereshapecode ought to do this, or even some obscure base function that I have not heard of, but Ive had no luck. Even repeating individual rows of a codedata.framecode is tricky  how do you pass a variable number of arguments to coderbindcodep  pTipsp  pBackground Why Because it it easier to crossvalidate logistic fits to such a data set than the aggregated binomial data.p  pIm analysing my with a generalised linear model as binomial regression in R and would like to cross validate  to control regularisation of my data since my purpose is predictive.p  pHowever, as far as I can tell, the default cross validation routines in R are not great for binomial data, simply skipping entire rows of the frequency table, rather than trials individually. This means that lightly and heavily sampled factor combinations have the same weight in my cost function, which is inappropriate for my data.p

Negative 908 pFrom the book Fundamentals of Database Systemsbrbr strongInternal Hashstrongp  blockquote   pFor internal files, hashing is typically implemented as a hash table through the use   of an array of records. Suppose that the array index range is from 0 to M  1, as   shown in Figure 17.8a then we have M slots whose addresses correspond to the   array indexes. We choose a hash function that transforms the hash field value into   an integer between 0 and M  1. One common hash function is the hK  K mod   M function, which returns the remainder of an integer hash field value K after divi   sion by M this value is then used for the record address. [...]p      pA collision occurs when the hash field value of a record that is being inserted hashes   to an address that already contains a different record.p blockquote  pbr strongExternal Hashstrongp  blockquote   pHashing for disk files is called external hashing. To suit the characteristics of disk   storage, the target address space is made of buckets, each of which holds multiple   records. A bucket is either one disk block or a cluster of contiguous disk blocks. The   hashing function maps a key into a relative bucket number, rather than assigning an   absolute block address to the bucket. A table maintained in the file header converts   the bucket number into the corresponding disk block address, as illustrated in   Figure 17.9.   The collision problem is less severe with buckets, because as many records as will fit   in a bucket can hash to the same bucket without causing problems.p blockquote  pI have the following questionbr 1 A record is always recorded inside a block, so does the internal hash return the blockaddress and the position of the record inside the blockbr 2 Why is the collision problem less severe with external hash I mean, lets suppose that every block can store 10 records I speculate that the file I will store contains 100 records, then, using external hash, I allocate maybe 1112 bucketsI assume that a bucket1 block, so the hash function will  return 1012 address to the buckets. br If I use an internal hash, because the hash function returns a direct address, I would use a functions that return to me about 100120 addresses.br So whats the difference In this way I think I have the same probability of collision using the two methods.p

Negative 908 pSo Im trying to make custom buttons, for which I need to combine different parts of the button background. To do this I figured using a FrameBuffer would work, however it did not give viable results. Therefore I attempted to test my FrameBuffer drawing method, by writing a simple test method, which returns a texture that is drawn to the display at every render call. This method is here note that it is a test method, so it may be a little poorly optimizedp  precode    private Texture test      BitmapFont f  ReverseBlade.fontTitle     f.setColorColor.LIGHTGRAY      FrameBuffer fbo  new FrameBufferFormat.RGBA8888, intf.getBoundsHi.width, intf.getBoundsHi.height, false     Batch b  ReverseBlade.batch     OrthographicCamera c  new OrthographicCamerafbo.getWidth, fbo.getHeight      c.setToOrthofalse     c.update     b.setProjectionMatrixc.combined      fbo.begin     b.begin      f.drawb, Hi, 0, 0      b.end     fbo.end      Texture t  fbo.getColorBufferTexture      fbo.dispose      b.setProjectionMatrixReverseBlade.camera.combined      return t  codepre  pHowever, nothing is displayed. The screen is dark... I have tried without the camera and multiple other variations that I can no longer remember. What am I doing wrongp  pstrongHalf Solutionstrong What I ended up having to do is to make a new Matrix4 object for the FrameBuffer like thisp  precodeMatrix4 m  new Matrix4 m.setToOrtho2D0, 0, fbo.getWidth, fbo.getHeight batch.setProjectionMatrixm codepre  pHowever, this makes everything that is drawn be upside down, like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com06bEi.png altUpside Downbr Why I dont know...p

Negative 908 pIm currently using a codeCcode library under C11, the problem that Im facing now and I never faced before, its to handle errors and failures in a way that will be meaningful for the end user of my program.p  pAt the moment in my C code there is something as codeassertfoocode, where codefoocode is a function from this C library and it returns a codeboolcode which reflects the state of the operations, codetruecode everything is ok, codefalsecode otherwise.p  pIm wondering if there is a better way to handle this, I would like to substitute the default message with some custom error code or a different stringmessage. Also note that I cant modify this library, so any possible solution needs to take this into account.p  pThe are 2 main points that concern mep  ol licodeassertcode is for when I compile my code in debug, I will basically never use codeassertcode in production or release mode, nor codeassertcode is intended to be used like Im using it for the moment li lia good portion of this functions is highly influenced by user input, so something that works at runtime is highly needed .li ol  pWhat should I do  I basically have a C function that returns a codeboolcode, it doesnt uses any C or C specific error handling function or macro, I should wrap it inside a codetry catchcode p  pIm also taking into account the fact that I would like to avoid calling codestdabortcode and I would prefer to clean up everything in case of failure.p

Lets say there are a tshirt with different sizes Small, Medium, Large.p  pIf i import with apiproductsdisplayfull I got only one id for the sizes.

But its not a safe way because it may be a product id 11 with combination 4.p  pAnd in order import i got product attribute id. How to map it to correct combinationp

Negative 908 pIm facing a problem, and i hope someone can help me out.

Negative 908 pRegarding the MM flagp  blockquote   pInstead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule   suitable for make describing the dependencies of the main source file.   The preprocessor outputs one make rule containing the object file name   for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included   files, including those coming from include or imacros command line   options.p blockquote  pThe version of clang Im using is part of the Android NDK and as such uses Windowsstyle paths, rather than Cygwinstyle paths. Using the codeMMcode flag, clang is outputting the name of an included files as an absolute, Windowsstyle path which has a colon after the drive letter, thus breaking the syntax that Cywgins GNU Make is expecting.p  pI could adjust the paths after clang outputs it and before make uses it, but this seems like a hack, as the codeMMcode flag is not producing appropriate output a valid make rule. Is there a flag or environment variable to correct this behaviorp

Negative 908 pWe have an iPads running iOS 1.51.7application that expects users to fill up a form and press a button to upload the data. The application then connects using VPN to the organizations backend server running a MSSQL web service, and uploads the data. The application had never any problem in connecting and uploading in the past one year until it was recompiled after the distribution certificate was renewed. p  pNow the .ipa generated by Mac OSX 10.9 XCode 5.1.1  Product  Archive and uploading the .ipa to the device via iTunes etc. runs without any problem for the data entry part, but crashes immediately when the server upload button is pressed. I am not going into the details of the connection and web service etc. because when the ipa is created by Xcode  Product  Run with the device connected, the .ipa is transferred to the device and has no problem in connecting with the web service and in uploading,p  pTherefore, the code generated by XCode Product  Run or for simulation with the device connected runs fine in doing the network connection etc., but the code generated by ProductArchive  with nothing changed, is failing in doing the network connection and upload. p  pThis is an urgent situation as the work in the field has stopped for about 200 users.

Negative 908 pI am using jaxb to autogenerate java classes from an xsd file.  I will need to persist the data that will be stored in the objects that will be instantiated from the classes.  strongIs there some way that the hibernate code can be autogenerated in the same classes that are autogenerated by JAXBstrong  p  pI will need to regenerate the classes many times in the course of development.  If I have to write the hibernate code by hand, the only reasonable method I can imagine is to write separate classes with hibernate for persistence, and to write connector classes that migrate the autogenerated classes into the persistence classes.  Otherwise, my handwritten hibernate code would be overwritten every time I rerun jaxb based on fine tuning of the xsd file.  If hibernate code were also autogenerated, I could end up using a lot fewer classes.p

Now, I go further and extend the type to codelocation3dtcode which has codezcode as well.p  pTo redefine  the procedure, I cannot override the previous one so I create a new procedure codecalcdist3dcode with the second argument of type of codelocation3dtcode and make a generic procedure codecalcdistcode for them.

The loop runs fine when its on its own but it runs as soon as I compile the game. What I want it to do is to run the loop when the mouse is clicked anywhere on the screen. But what actually happens is that it runs the loop only once and I have to click the mouse multiple times before the loop is complete and the block is on the other side of the screen images below. Can someone please shed some light on how I would go about setting it up so that it runs the whole loop and moves the block from left to right with a single mouse click.p  pThanks a lot.p  pImages This is where the block starts at a hrefhttpi.imgur.comwU6ej1J.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comwU6ej1J.pnga This is what I want it to end up like when the mouse is clicked a hrefhttpi.imgur.comi0IpJd4.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comi0IpJd4.pngap

Negative 908 pIm having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around how I should get this accomplished. Everything Im attempting turns out to cause an infinite redirect loop.p  pHere is the scenario. A site is currently being worked on at codehttpexample.comcode. While this site is being worked on, I want to send all visitors to, lets say codehttpexample.comtemp.htmlcode. Im basically wanting a catchall so that for any URL a person might typeclick codehttpexample.comblogpost1code they get redirected to the root HTML directory, but only to that codetemp.htmlcode page. Normally this is a straight forward process, but the problem Im running into is the fact that I want visitors who visit any part of the domain which includes the root directory will be directed to the root directory, although to a specific page. But its because of this that my code keeps causing a redirect loop.p  pSo my first question is of course, what am I missing How can I accomplish this My second question would be, is this the best method for dealing with sites that are temporarily being worked onp  pThanksp

Negative 908 pI had a very simple existing webapplication.   Its using MySQL, Hibernate 4, Spring 4.1.2, Junit 4.11.  The backend was working perfectly.   The backend was using SpringWS, and I had a number of RESTful webservices.    All my DAO code is unit tested and working, the Spring services were tested and working, and all the controllers were tested and working.   The frontend was using AngularJS to make RESTful calls to the backend.  The database is MySQL on a Linux box running with Tomcat on the same Linux box.p  pNow ... I have already moved the MySQL database to the cloud.  I am using Google Cloud SQL, and it was easy to import my database.   I changed my backend to point to the Cloud SQL with a new ip address, new username and password, and again all the DAO, Services, and Controllers all worked.p  pNow, I am moving the webapp into GAE, the Google App Engine.  I have added the appengineweb.xml.  In Eclipse, I changed the targeted runtime of this project to GAE 1.9.15.br I have had to make numerous changes to the pom.xml to add more mavensurefire plugins and jars.   I added the appengine jars also, and as every issue comes up, I am working on resolving those issues.p  pThat was a little history of where I was and where I am going.   When I try to do a mvn cleaninstall, I am running some DAO unit tests, and I am getting an errorp  precodeorg.hibernate.HibernateException Could not obtain transactionsynchronized Session for current thread at org.springframework.orm.hibernate4.SpringSessionContext.currentSessionSpringSessionContext.java134 at org.hibernate.internal.SessionFactoryImpl.getCurrentSessionSessionFactoryImpl.java990 at com.tomholmes.angularjs.phonebook.server.dao.ContactDaoImpl.getContactEntityContactDaoImpl.java72 at com.tomholmes.angularjs.phonebook.server.dao.ContactDaoTest.testContactUpdateContactDaoTest.java358 at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0Native Method at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invokeNativeMethodAccessorImpl.java57 at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invokeDelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java43 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java606 at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod1.runReflectiveCallFrameworkMethod.java47 at org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.runReflectiveCallable.java12 at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosivelyFrameworkMethod.java44 at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluateInvokeMethod.java17 at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluateRunBefores.java26 at org.springframework.test.context.junit4.statements.RunBeforeTestMethodCallbacks.evaluateRunBeforeTestMethodCallbacks.java73 at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluateRunAfters.java27 at org.springframework.test.context.junit4.statements.RunAfterTestMethodCallbacks.evaluateRunAfterTestMethodCallbacks.java82 at org.springframework.test.context.junit4.statements.SpringRepeat.evaluateSpringRepeat.java73 at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeafParentRunner.java271 at org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.runChildSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.java217 at org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.runChildSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.java83 at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner3.runParentRunner.java238 at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner1.scheduleParentRunner.java63 at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildrenParentRunner.java236 at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access000ParentRunner.java53 at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner2.evaluateParentRunner.java229 at org.springframework.test.context.junit4.statements.RunBeforeTestClassCallbacks.evaluateRunBeforeTestClassCallbacks.java61 at org.springframework.test.context.junit4.statements.RunAfterTestClassCallbacks.evaluateRunAfterTestClassCallbacks.java68 at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runParentRunner.java309 at org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.runSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.java163 at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit4.runner.JUnit4TestReference.runJUnit4TestReference.java50 at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.TestExecution.runTestExecution.java38 at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTestsRemoteTestRunner.java459 at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runTestsRemoteTestRunner.java675 at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.runRemoteTestRunner.java382 at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.runner.RemoteTestRunner.mainRemoteTestRunner.java192 codepre  pI dont know if I need to use persistence.xml   Do I need to use DataNucleus to talk to the CloudSQL  I dont think I do, but I am not sure.

Negative 908 pI am uploading a table from excel, and some junk records are coming along with it. Specifically, in the first field after all the data I need comes through, I get a record that contains the phrase random number of random number records came through. I would like to delete all the records after the this phrase. What I am trying to do right now is find the position of this record, using a method like DoCmd.Seek or Findfirst, but am not sure if this is the correct way. Once I found this position, I would do something like codeDoCmd.RunSQL Delete from table where field in select bottom total records  position of phrase records came through field from tblCopyUtlwos, FalsecodeBut am unsure how to find the position of that phrase in the field. Any tips for finding the position, or better ways for deleting the records below the phrase in the field would be appreciated Thank youp

If the deserializer doesnt have access to the assembly containing the actual value of codeUserPropcode, I get a codeJsonSerializationExceptioncode.p  pI would like to change that behavior a bit. I would like to try and deserialize the UserProp property, and if it fails  do something. Maybe raise an exception, maybe set the deserialized value to null.p  pHow can I tell JSON.NET to use custom code when deserializing a specific property I cant use a codeJsonConvertercode, because I dont know the actual type of codeUserPropcode.p  pExample  On the serialization side I have this codep  precodeprivate class MyContext  ...  var data  new MyData  UserProp  new MyContext  codepre  pThe deserialization fails claiming it cant create the MyContext class which is correct, because MyContext is a private class in another assembly.

Negative 908 pIm using a REST wrapper in Python called Hammock.  Better than I can explain Hammock is a fun module lets you deal with rest APIs by converting them into dead simple programmatic APIs. It uses popular requests module in backyard to provide fullfledged rest experience.p  pIt will turn api.websiteendpoint into website.end.point which makes working with the API pretty simple.  The issue Ive run into is when an endpoint has a character in it that Python does not allow in names,  in this case ex api.websiteendpoint.  Accessing an endpoint like this turns into website.endpoint, which is invalid python code.p  pI looked and  is a totally valid character to have in a REST endpoint name.  Is there a way to allow this character, maybe the equivalent of a character escape or something  I think I could fix it in the inner code of the module, but figure thats probably a bad way to go about this.  Any ideasp

Negative 908 pI have a simple little admin system that works fine on IIS, but Im having problems moving it over to Linux. p  pThe system can create, rename and delete directories, create and uploadsave files, and edit, rename or delete those files. On Linux I keep running into permission problems. The hosting company is solving the problem on a folder by folder basis, which isnt really a solution, because as soon as the system tries to create a new directory, it falls down.p  pI dont really understand Linux, but from reading it seems ColdFusion runs as a user, and that user has certain permissions given to it. Whats the ideal setup for the ColdFusion user or solution on Linux, so I can do what I need to do to any folderfile under the root For example, everything under codehomemysitepublichtmlcodep  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 908 pI have next situation I have a lot of keys in redis. It stored as codestringcode type before. So I had to take values likep  pcodeMGET key1 key2 ... keyncode.p  pIn fact I use ruby script with coderediscode gem but I think easy to explain question on raw queries. Anyway now these keys stored in the database as codelistcode. And its now harder to collect all the values because I need to do emnem queries  by one for each listp  pcodeLRANGE key1 0 1code,codeLRANGE key2 0 1code and so on.p  pIt spend a lot of time and smells bad. Probably someone can recommend something betterp  pThanksp  pstrongUPDstrongp  pItamarHaber and rchang properly made a remarks in comments. Thanks.p  pFor more information I will explain some details about application where I use this on some concert example I have dashboard for controlling deployment of applications. History of versions for each application stored exactly in redis as codelistcodesomething like codeapplication1historycode, codeapplication2historycode. In form I have dropdown inputs with these versions. Each application has own history of installed versions.p  pSo for filling dashboard form I need to take values from all these keysI mean codehistorycode keys. It should be in the end something like multiple arrayslike arrays in array  main is codeindividually accessedcode arrays and not collapsed all values into one big array. And I need always whole range of values from each key. Now it seems like broken bicycle and spend much time if I work with 100 keysp  precodevalues  [] keys  [application1history, application2history] keys.each do k   values ltlt redis.lrangek, 0, 1 end codepre  pstrongUPDstrongp  pI guess this question hasnt solutions. One variant which that can alleviate the situation and it might be worth a try  codepipeliningcode.p  pBut I think best solution will be change type of storing data like json as codestringcode type. codeStringcode keys easy to take by codeMGETcode command and json easy to parse.p

Negative 908 pfor a more precise overview about my problem please look here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30000958calculatepiinpythonwithpolygonsPolygonally calculate Piap  pI used codempmathcode, codedecimalcode and some other modules to display more than the standard amount of digits, but only the first 15 of them are correct  meaning that when I run my program calculating pi the rest after the first 15 digits is inaccurate.p  pOr if I say codempf13code it prints code0.3333333333333331574563241647...code. Is there any way to let Python calculate with exact numbers  It is very very important for me because my method will produce angles like code0.0000000000000000000000245331code, for example, and if this will be rounded Ive got a problem.p  pAnother example I tried is to calculate code0.0001  0.0002  0.0003code with and without the codedecimalcode module. Without it printed code0.0code and with it gave some sort of code1.5223456224E31code. I assume this problem is coming from the binary calculation of Pythonp  pDo you know a language that can calculate it exactly or better how to realise it in Pythonp  pPS Where does the problem with the lack of precision after 15 digits come from p

Negative 908 pIm making a vb application that processes files and lets the user edit them through a user interface, instead of typing into the files themselves. Im reading the values from one file, allowing the user to modify and check them, and then saving them back into a file again. Im doing this by loading a template, putting the users values in, and then saving the filled out template back to the disk. The problem is, when I distribute the application, I need a way for the user to have the template file, which is currently just sitting in the project directory. p  pHeres a quick little diagram of what happens to the informationp  precodeRead values from disk gt User edits values gt Values go into template string gt Template string is saved to disk. codepre  pI was thinking of making a Visual Basic Module that just has the contents of the file as a string, but I was hoping there was a way for me to include the template file along with the application binary The application.exe file and just read it from disk at run timep  pIm aware of how to read files from the disk in Visual Basic, but my concern is with making sure that the template file is always in a location I can be certain of, and that I can make sure the user takes the data file with them. p  pAlternatively, if it can get the template built into the executable, similar to how images and icons are, then that would be ideal. However, Im not sure how to do that, or how to read the text out of it once its included there, apart from making a VB module and just pasting the template in, and then escaping all the tabs, newlines, and quotes manually Which will be a headache.p  pOne more idea I had, which I can use as a last resort, is to load the file into My.Settings and read it from there, but that doesnt seem like how this is supposed to be done. p  pIm using Visual Studio 2013, I just made a windows forms application in visual basic and have been working with that up until now. Let me know if you need any more information, I hope Ive provided enough. p

Negative 908 pIve been tasked with a finding a way to resolve an issue of importing invoices into Quickbooks 2015 professional from a 3rd party system which handles real estate transactions. The problem is Quickbooks imports the invoices from the other system but will not import the invoice number instead assigning its own invoice number and causing accounting personnel to have to go back into QB and change the invoice number manually for upwards of 100 invoices a day. p  pQuestion is whether there is a way to write a script  which can force QB to import the original invoice number and not override it, or to possibly just write a script to read the invoice fields, put them in a table or csv and then import that into QB  Any input on how to best tackle this would be appreciated. p

Negative 908 pI have created a sample java project which contains servlets and servlet code is having log entries to print the log messages. I am using SLFj to print the logs in the servlets.

Negative 908 pI am using OpenGL via OpenTK to perform spatial queries on lots of point cloud data on the GPU. Each frame of data is around 200k points. This works well flor low numbers of queries lt10queries  60fps but does not scale as more are performed per data frame 100queries  6fps.p  pI would have expected modern GPUs to be able to chew through 20 million points 200k  100 queries points from 100 draw calls without breaking a sweat especially since each codeglDrawArrayscode uses the same VBO.p  pA spatial query consists of setting some uniforms and a codeglDrawArrayscode call. The geom shader then chooses to emit or not emit a vertex based on the result of the query. I have tried with  without branching and it makes no difference. The VBO used is separated attributes, one is codeSTATICDRAWcode and other is codeDYNAMICDRAWcode updated before each batch frame of spatial queries. Transform feedback then collects the data. p  pProfiling shows that codeglGetQueryObjectcode is by far the slowest call probably blocking, 5600 inclusive samples compared to 127 from codeglDrawArryscode but Im not sure how to improve this. I tried making lots of little result buffers in GPU memory and binding a new transform feedback buffer for each query, but this had no effect  perhaps due to running on a single core The other option would be to read the video memory from the previous query from another thread, but this throws an codeAccess Violationcode and Im unsure if the gains would be that significant.p  pAny thoughts on how to improve performance  Am I missing something obvious like a debug mode that needs switching offp

Negative 908 pstrongAm I safe only handling remote notifications in codeapplication didReceiveRemoteNotification fetchCompletionHandlercodestrongp  pMy app is designed for iOS 8, and Im working on adding remote notification support for it. The documents are a little confusing, Im guessing due to the ways remote notifications have progressed through the years. p  pIs there any scenario where I would want to handle notifications in codeapplication didFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode versus handling it all in codeapplication didReceiveRemoteNotification fetchCompletionHandlercodep  pAt first I thought I needed to handle remote notifications in codeapplication didFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode when the app is not running and is launched by tapping a notification, but codeapplication didReceiveRemoteNotification fetchCompletionHandlercode is still called in that scenario. p  pP. S. Apples docs state the OS will start your app and call codeapplication didReceiveRemoteNotification fetchCompletionHandlercode if codecontentavailablecode is passed with a value of code1code, but in my experience it will actually wake and run your app for any value, as long as codecontentavailablecode is included at all. Am I misunderstanding somethingp

Negative 908 pAn odd one here. Ive built an app in Android Studio which is working perfectly in Android 4 4.4.2, but it just stopping on Android 5.0.2. Its not throwing up any errors, just stopping.  Going line by line, it seems to be focussed on the SharedPreferences file, which its not loading. p  pprotected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState p  precode   try          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState           final SharedPreferences sharedPreferences  this.getSharedPreferencesappname, MODEPRIVATE          currentlyTracking  sharedPreferences.getBooleancurrentlyTracking, false codepre  pSo, on Android 4, going line by line, when I get to the currentlytracking line, I can view the contents of the SharedPreferences file in the Variables window, and the app works. On Android 5, when I get to the currentlytracking line, none of the variables show up, and it just says Collecting data. The app then stops if I try to continue on.p  pInterestingly, if I change the name of the Sharedpreferences file, it will create a new file but then fail to save to it.p  pThis is only happening on Android 5, any thoughts would be appreciated.p  pCheersp

Negative 908 pIm working on an entertainment app where each user gets a score. I need a way to get a users rank and display it to them.p  pIm using Parse to store my data but there dont seem to be any viable ways to get a players rank quickly and reliably in large data sets. This is because only up to 1000 users can be queried at a time and count queries are unreliable as mentioned in the a hrefhttpswww.parse.comdocsiosguideperformanceavoidcountoperations relnofollowdocumentationa.p  pAnother idea I had was to use Game Center because it is a simple way to store scores and retrieve ranks. However along with Game Center comes a bunch of obtrusive stuff such as the welcome back message and your app appearing on the game center dashboard. My app is not really a game so I dont want all this.p  pMy app is integrated with Facebook but the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsgamesscores relnofollowscores APIa doesnt seem viable either because there is no way to compare user scores outside of peoples friends.p  pSo my question is What services or workarounds would recommend for ranking my usersp  pThanksp

Im only trying to pass some very simple information i.e. if the kinect recognizes a hand gesture, the arduino do this and I have found people talking about using the serial port to do this.  I looked at the documentations and peoples code, but Im very new to C and dont really understand how the serial port works.

Negative 908 pIm using java.util.logging. In my code, Im adding multiple handlers to my logger. I have 1 ConsoleHandler and 1 FileHandler.

Negative 908 pdisclaimer I am just helping out our ecommerce team. I dont really know much about GA.p  pWe are tracking our google translate widget in google analytics. Unfortunately, it sends back eventLabel as undefined. Event label should represent the language that a user has chosen. The team has wrapped this in some kid of trigger in google tag manager so that it sends information back to GA only when someone clicks on the widget. Apparently it was sending the information correctly before they did this, but only half of the time. So either it is sending incomplete information or it only sends information every once and a while. The eventValue property is also being returned as undefined. p  pIf anyone can demystify any part of how this widget sends information to GA, that would also be helpful. Im having trouble finding information on the web about it. p

Negative 908 pIm working with PostgreSQL 9.1. Lets say I have a table where some columns have codeUNIQUEcode constraint. The easiest examplep  precodeCREATE TABLE test      value INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE  codepre  pNow, when inserting some values, I have to separately handle the case, where the values to be inserted are already in the table. I have two optionsp  ul liMake a codeSELECTcode beforehand to ensure the values are not in the table, orli liExecute the codeINSERTcode and watch for any errors the server might return.li ul  pThe application utilizing the PostgreSQL database is written in Ruby. Heres how I would code the second optionp  precoderequire pg  db  PG.connect...  begin     db.execINSERT INTO test VALUES 66 rescue PGUniqueViolation      ... the values are already in the table else      ... the values were brand new end  db.close codepre  pHeres my thinking lets suppose we make a codeSELECTcode first, before inserting. The SQL engine would have to scan the rows and return any matching tuples. If there are none, we make an codeINSERTcode, which presumably makes yet another scan, to see if the codeUNIQUEcode constraint is not about to be violated by any chance. So, in theory, second option would speed the execution up by 50. Is this how PostgreSQL would actually behavep  pWere assuming theres no ambiguity when it comes to the exception itself e.g. we only have one codeUNIQUEcode constraint.p  pIs it a common practice Or are there any caveats to it Are there any more alternativesp

Negative 908 pI need to dynamically load a form into a Bootbox modal window. Im loading the form through Ajax. In the form is a jQuery UI datepicker field.p  pUsing the browsers debugger, when the form is loaded through Ajax, I can see the datepicker element added to the DOM. But, clicking the field doesnt do anything. The calendar doesnt appear, and more importantly, the datepicker DOM element doesnt change like it does when I load a datepicker field directly on the page.p  pHeres my Ajax call from the index pagep  precode.ajax     type post,     timeout 100000,     url cfcsitefunctions.cfc,     beforeSend function           bootbox.dialog             message Loading...,             title modaltitle,             onEscapefalse,             backdroptrue,             closeButtontrue,             buttons                  Cancel                            ,     data          method buildMyForm     ,     success functionobjResponse         .bootboxbody.htmlobjResponse     ,     error functionxhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError         .bootboxbody.htmlError loading form.       codepre  pHeres the Coldfusion function being called by the Ajax call which builds the form and initializes the datepicker fieldp  precodeltcffunction namebuildMyForm accessremote returntypeany returnformatplaingt      ltcfsavecontent variablelocal.buildMyFormgt          ltscript typetextjavascriptgt             document.readyfunctione                  dateposted.datepicker                     showAnim slide                                       ltscriptgt          ltcfoutputgt              ltform methodpost ideditform nameeditformgt                  ltdiv classformgroupgt                     ltlabel fordateposted classrequiredgtDateltlabelgt                     ltinput typetext classformcontrol iddateposted namedateposted required autocompleteoffgt                 ltdivgt              ltformgt          ltcfoutputgt     ltcfsavecontentgt      ltcfreturn local.buildMyFormgt ltcffunctiongt codepre  pAny thoughts why the datepicker element would initialize, but then not work when you click the date field  Theres a similar question but its solution was to update the CSS because the datepicker calendar was showing with a lower zindex than the Bootbox modal. But, in my case, the datepicker element isnt being populated at all when you click the date field, so its not just a matter of it being hidden.p

Negative 908 pI have a WCF service which provides an endpoint to dynamically generate a QRCode image. The image is first written to a memory stream codetempStreamcode. I then have the following code in the endpointp  precodeHttpResponse response  HttpContext.Current.Response response.Clear response.ClearContent response.ClearHeaders  response.Buffer  false response.ContentType  imagepng response.CacheControl  NoCache  response.AddHeaderContentLength, tempStream.Length.ToString response.AddHeaderAcceptRanges, bytes  tempStream.WriteToresponse.OutputStream  response.Flush response.End codepre  pIt works fine in Firefox. The image is downloaded if I hit the endpoint manually and it loads inline if I reference the endpoint as the codesrccode attribute in an codeimgcode tag. However, in IE, the image does not load inline in an codeimgcode tag, and if I try to hit the endpoint manually, it loads the full image the first time but any subsequent refreshes seemingly until the browser is restarted, it only loads part of the image.p  pUpon inspection of the network tab in the F12 window, it seems to be downloading exactly 1.00 KB of data including headers from the server, meaning it gets about 750 KB of image data. Then it makes another identical request to the server and gets only the headers back with no image data. The codeContentLengthcode header is set correctly to the size of the image IE just doesnt download that much. Again, Firefox is fine.p  pMy coworker recommended that I set codetransferModecode to codeStreamedcode in codeWeb.configcode, which I did, but that didnt work either. How can I get IE to download the entire image in one gop  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI should note that when running the WCF service in Visual Studios IIS Express server, Internet Explorer works fine. It is only when the application is deployed to IIS 7.5 that the problem occurs. Firefox works fine in both environments.p
