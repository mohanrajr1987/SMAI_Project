Positive 603 pI am running a piece of python code on a raspberry pi.br The function of the code is that GPIO 5 is set as a pull up resistor with a momentary switch attached. When the switch is pressed it grounds the pull up resistor. I am attempting to use the button push to trigger a callback.br The callback works like thisbr If the button is pressed and detected as still pressed it defines a variable called t1 as the current time.br If the button is detected as no longer pressed it defines a variable called t2 then subtracts t1 from t2 to find the time difference amount of time button was held down for. It then converts that value to an integer defined as variable deltaseconds.  Then it takes action based on the length the button was held for. If more than 7 seconds, reboot the raspberry pi, if more than 1 second but less than 7 it toggles output GPIO12 between high and low.  p  pThe issue I am experiencing is like thisbr The code runsbr When the button is pressed I see the print of Button 5 pressedbr When the button is released I see the print Button 5 releasedbr Then an error is display as codeUnboundLocalError local variable t1 referenced before assignmentcodebr The error is in reference to line 21 codedelta  t2t1code  p  pThe full code looks like this  p  precodeimport os import RPi.GPIO as GPIO import webiopi import time import datetime from datetime import datetime GPIO.setwarningsTrue GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BCM BUTTON5  5 GPIO.setup5, GPIO.IN, pullupdownGPIO.PUDUP GPIO.setup12,GPIO.OUT GPIO.output12,1 Just to visually distinguish between setup steps and main program def pressedBUTTON5     if GPIO.input5  False         t1  datetime.now         print Button 5 pressed     elif GPIO.input5  True         print Button 5 released         t2  datetime.now         delta  t2t1         deltaseconds  delta.totalseconds         if deltaseconds gt 7   pressed for gt 7 seconds             print Restarting System             subprocess.call[shutdown r now System halted by GPIO action amp], shellTrue         elif deltaseconds gt 1   press for gt 1 lt 7 seconds             print Toggling GPIO 12             GPIO.output12, not GPIO.input12 GPIO.addeventdetectBUTTON5, GPIO.BOTH, bouncetime200 GPIO.addeventcallbackBUTTON5, pressed try     while True         time.sleep1 except KeyboardInterrupt     GPIO.cleanup        clean up GPIO on CTRLC exit codepre

Positive 603 pI want to implement a realtime system in which events are triggered at known times.  I could use System.Timers.Timer, and at the end of each event calculate when the next event happens and go into a sleep mode until it occurs some milliseconds later.p  pThe question is, is this the only option I have available or is there a way for events to Trigger after a known time, without starting hundreds of Timersp  pThe reason for the question is, while I expect each event to execute very quickly, its possible that an events start  duration will exceed the next events start, and I dont want that.  Therefore, whatever you suggest has to be independent of the code that executes.p
Positive 603 pI am having trouble understanding what my frequency parameter should be in the following time seriesp  pI have hourly temperature for every day from April to November. To take care of missing data, I averaged the temperature per month at each hour. I have the temperatures of an average day in April, May, etc., for a total of 24 data points per month for 8 months.p  pDoes this require two seasonal periodsp  pI thought that the frequency parameter should be 24 for observations per month, but I am not 100 confident. When I plot the ACF of the TS with freq24, the lags occur at decimal values, which throws me off. However, the graph shows 8 periods, which makes logical sense because there are 8 months. Any help and guidance would be very much appreciated, thank youp

Negative 603 pIm going to build a turnkey solution for a vertical market, and would like to offer both options software as a service, and give them the opportunity to host the application on their own. In other words, Im aiming to have similar deployment options as Joels FogBugz.p  pIm a Python programmer, and I could fly over the project with Django. There are several reasons I prefer PHP thoughp  p1 Django installation, and configuration assumes you have access to a shell my target is not the programmer type. Although I could offer installation service, but not on their servers.p  p2 Django runs only on some specific hosts that must take special care to enable it. Installing modpythonmodwsgi, and most likely the minority of my potential clients would have root access, or even a cpanel.p  p3 Using PHP would mean I could run it on their existing server. I would have no need to move them to a Djangoenabled server, and no downtime for their emails, while the DNS updates.p  pOn the other hand, I have very little experience with PHP. Smarty as a templating language looks nice, and works similarly to Django templates. It doesnt offer template inheritance though, except in a very hackish way in which I wish not to use as it could break the application if the designer messes them up.

Negative 603 pI have a great deal of respect for Mono and CSLA.  I would like to utilize CSLA on nonMicrosoft operating systems.  I accept the fact that Mono will always be two steps behind Microsoft, but Mono supports enough of the .Net framework to facilitate a wide range of interesting applications.  I also realize that Mono does not support many of the 3.0 .Net additions such as WPF although it must to a small degree for Moonlight to function.  For my current needs, WPF support is not important, nor is WCF.  I sincerely appreciate all the tedious data binding support Rocky has implemented and continues to maintain in CSLA.  For many applications, this is where I see CSLA adding substantial value.  I realize CSLA brings many other features to the table, but for me data binding is very important.  I suspect that the main compatibility issues with CSLA under Mono are centered around Mono not implementing all the .Net data binding nuances especially DataGrids and serialization format differences.  I have a few ideas on how to attack these perceived problems, but I would love to hear from anyone that has already been down this road.p  pEdit For what its worth, I did post this exact question on the CSLA forum quite some time ago.  The CSLA community and Rocky are quick to answer questions.  However, this question never received any answer.  I believe the reason for this is simple  Rocky has been focused only on MS tech for a long time.  I dont fault him for this.  Rocky has a substantial investment in CSLA.  He is the benevolent dictator.  Im thankful that he made CSLA open source.  I suspect he has enough issues keeping up with the major API churn every couple of years in the Microsoft world.  LinuxMac OS is probably not on his radar.  It probably should not be...currently anyway.  Most Linux or Mac OS folks have never even heard of CSLA.  p  pYou can always fork the source, strip it down, enhance, etc. to make it work with Mono.  If you do this, you wont have the CSLA community behind you at least for now.  For this reason, I have abandoned this effort.p  pstrongUpdatestrong It seems that Rocky is interested in Mono now.

Negative 603 pIve been reading that if an collection gets released it releases all its objects as well.

The system decides if its good to deallocate or not. In most cases it will, but in some cases not.p  pSo I am wondering if a collection can cause memory leaks like this And when it does release all its objects upon an release message to the collection itself, then it should actually retain all objects inside the collection as soon as I retain the collection itself.p  pHelp me to get a clear picture about that.

Negative 603 pThis is a question Ive now had for a few different apps Ive built, and I have yet to be satisified with any of the solutions Ive come up with.  I thought Id put it out there to the community to see other solutions there might be.p  pLets say you have an Activity that downloads a complex tree of data in this case via json, but it could be anything, unmarshalls that data to a set of java objects in this case using gson, but again, could be whatever, then spawns additional activities to view different parts of that data.  There might be one activity to view Trips in your response, and another to view Flights in those trips, and maybe another to view Passengers of those flights.p  pMy initial implementation of this app was to unmarshall all the Trips in the first activity, then pass them by value as an extra in the intent to the TripActivity.  The TripActivity then passes individual flights to the FlightActivity, and so on.p  pThe problem with this is that theres a noticeable pause between activities while the app serializes and deserializes the data.  Were talking several seconds.  The pause is quite noticeable when my tree uses Serialization or Parcelable to pass data around.  Initial performance testing with using googles Parcelable instead show a roughly 30 speedup over serialization, but Parcelable is difficult to work with and doesnt seem to handle circular object references well like Serialization does, and besides it still pauses for almost as many seconds, so Ive put that experiment on the backburner while I try other things.  p  pSo then I tried moving the tree of objects directly into the Application class.  Each activity just gets the tree directly from the app whenever it needs it.  This makes performance quite snappy, but handling corner cases like unexpected activity startstops either due to activity crashes or because the activity has been closed temporarily to make more memory available, or whatever other cause seems tricky.  Perhaps its no more than implementing codeonSaveInstanceStatecode, Im not sure, but the solution seems a bit hacky so I havent investigated further yet.p  pSo in search of a less cobbledtogether solution, I tried creating a custom ContentProvider to store and retrieve my objects.  Since ContentProviders can be configured to run inprocess using codemultiprocesstruecode, I thought that would be an excellent way to avoid serialization costs while doing something more standard than storing data in the Application object.  However, ContentProviders were clearly not intended to return arbitrary object types  they only support types such as numbers, strings, booleans, etc.  It appears I can finagle one to store arbitrary objects by using codeContentResolver.getContentProviderClient.getLocalContentProvidercode and accessing my custom class directly, but Im not sure thats less hacky than storing data in the Application object.p  pSurely someone must have a good solution to this problem.  What am I doing wrongp

Negative 603 pMy company has a web analytics package which we use for our own and customer marketing campaign tracking. It uses a combination of server logs, JS amp image web bugs, cookies, unique cached files, and ETag headers to collect and collate user activity.p  pRecently we have found that a certain unnamed privacyguard application which plugs into the users browser is munging certain tracking codes with the apparent intent of preventing the users activity from being tracked. We have purchased a copy of the app and tested locally, and it does the same for many other web bug and analytics applications including Google Analytics.p  pFor most of these, the way in which the data is altered would prevent the tracking software from operating properly. However, they use a consistent pattern for the alterations, and due to the way that our collation works, their changes have no effect on the operation of our tracking and analytics package. Well, there is one side effect which reduces accuracy of some timing calculations from millis to seconds.p  pIn a nutshell, the situation isp  ol lipOur analytics results are unaffected by the applications attempt to subvert the datapli lipThe user clearly intends to prevent analysis of their online activitypli lipIt is possible for us to alter our application to detect the attempted blockingpli lipWe would have to spend time and money patching and testing our application in order to make the attempted privacy blocking actually successfulpli ol  pSo there is an ethical quandary, as to how much effort we should take to detect and honor the users wishes.

Our application, without alteration, still tracks users who use it. We would have to change our app in order to emnotem track these users.p  pWe do have a cookiebased optout which the user can select from the trackers home page.p  pWe sent a note to the company that developed the privacy application, and they said they would look into it.pli ul

Negative 603 pAs noted in an earlier question, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2768834howtoziponeienumerablewithitselfHow to Zip enumerable with itselfa, I am working on some math algorithms based on lists of points.  I am currently working on point in polygon.  I have the code for how to do that and have found several good references here on SO, such as this link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions217578pointinpolygonakahittestHit testa.  So, I can figure out whether or not a point is in a polygon.  As part of determining that, I want to determine if the point is actually on the polygon.  This I can also do.  If I can do all of that, what is my question you might askp  pCan I do it efficiently using LINQ  I can already do something like the following assuming a Pairwise extension method as described in my earlier question as well as in links to which my questionanswers links, and assuming a Position type that has X and Y members.  I have not tested much, so the lambda might not be 100 correct.  Also, it does not take very small differences into account.p  pstrongEDITstrong Note that most recent edit of this code has changed from TakeWhile to TakeWhileInclusive.  See the extension method towards the end of this post.p  precode  Extend a ray from pt towards the left.  Does this ray intersect the segment p1gtp2  By definition, the ray extending from pt cannot intersect a horizontal segment, so our  first check is to see whether or not the segment is horizontal.

If it is not, there could be an intersection.  public static bool PointIntersectSegmentPosition p1, Position p2, Position pt    bool intersect  false   if p1.Y  p2.Y         Is pt between vertically p1 and p2        If so, the ray from pt might intersect.

In essence,    this algorithm extends a ray infinitely from pt.  In my implementation I am extending to the left.    If the point is inside the polygon, then the ray will intersect the polygon a odd number of times.    If the point is outside the polygon, then the ray will intersect the polygon an even number of times.    Ideally, we would be able to report not only if the point is inside or outside of the polygon, but    also if it is on the polygon i.e. it lies on one of the segments.  Note that on and     insideoutside are exlusive.  The point is either on the polygon or it is inside or outside, it    cannot be inside and on or outside and on.    So, the algorithm is as follows    1.  Consider the points of the polygon as pairs making up the segments p1gtp2, p2gtp3, etc.    2.  For each segment, perform two calculations            Does the ray extending left from pt intersect the segment          Is pt on the segment p[i], p[i1]    3.  Count the total number of intersections.  If odd, point is inside.  If even, point is outside.    4.  Here is the tricky part, if the point is on any segment, then we can stop.  If it is on the         first segment, then there is no need to go through the onoff calculation and the intersection        calculation for the rest of the segments.      var result  pts.Pairwise p1, p2 gt                                                      int intersect  0                            int on  0                             on  PointOnSegmentp1, p2, pt  1  0                            if on  0                                                          Dont really need to determine intersection if we already know that pt is on p1gtp2.                              intersect  PointIntersectSegmentp1, p2, pt  1  0                                                        return new  on, intersect                                                     .TakeWhileInclusiveitem gt item.on  0 Only consider segments until or if pt is on a segment.                          .Aggregatecurr, next gt new     Keep a running total of how many intersections.                                                                                                             on  curr.on  next.on,                                                        intersect  curr.intersect  next.intersect                                                         if result.on  0        return PointInPolygonLocation.On      else        return result.intersect  2  0  PointInPolygonLocation.Outside  PointInPolygonLocation.Inside     codepre  pThis function, PointInPolygon, takes the input Position, pt, iterates over the input sequence of position values, and uses the Jordan Curve method to determine how many times a ray extended from pt to the left intersects the polygon.  The lambda expression will yield, into the zipped list, 1 for every segment that is crossed, and 0 for the rest.  The sum of these values determines if pt is inside or outside of the polygon odd  inside, even  outside.  So far, so good.p  pNow, for any consecutive pairs of position values in the sequence i.e. in any execution of the lambda, we can also determine if pt is ON the segment p1, p2.  If that is the case, we can stop the calculation because we have our answer.p  pUltimately, my question is this  Can I perform this calculation maybe using Aggregate such that we will only iterate over the sequence no more than 1 time AND can we stop the iteration if we encounter a segment that pt is ON  In other words, if pt is ON the very first segment, there is no need to examine the rest of the segments because we have the answer.p  pIt might very well be that this operation particularly the requirementdesire to possibly stop the iteration early does not really lend itself well to the LINQ approach.p  pIt just occurred to me that maybe the lambda expression could yield a tuple, the intersection value 1 or 0 or maybe true or false and the on value true or false.  Maybe then I could use TakeWhileanontype.PointOnPolygon  false.  If I Sum the tuples and if ON  1, then the point is ON the polygon.  Otherwise, the oddness or evenness of the sum of the other part of the tuple tells if the point is inside or outside.p  pstrongEDITstrong Cleaned up the code formatting, moved the lambda to a standalone function, added a new function to if the point is on a segment.  The new function is really a dummy, it just compares the input point to the start and end points of the segment and returns true if either is equal.  So, it should probably be called PointIsOnEndpointOfSegment.  There is already a lot of code here and I didnt want to cloud the issue with more fooling around with xs and ys to do the real ON calculation.p  pWith the code as it is now, I can do the following 1.  View sequence of points as a sequence of pairs segments via Pairwise. 2.  In the Pairwise result selector, I compute an anonymous type containing the value intersection1 if the ray extending leftwards from pt intersects the segment and the value on1 if the point is on the segment. 3.  Express the intersectionon anonymous types as a sequence.p  pI thought I could use TakeWhile to take all of the anonymous types until or if one of the anonymous types indicates that the pt was ON a segment.  Then, using Aggregate, sum the values of intersection and on.  If the sum of on  0, then the point was on one of the segments.  Otherwise, the sum of intersection will tell us if the point is inside odd or outside even  or zero.p  pUnfortunately, I ran into the a similar problem with TakeWhile as was described herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2242318howcoulditake1moreitemfromlinqstakewhileHow to TakeWhile PLUS one more elementa.p  pMy TakeWhile takes all of the items from the sequence up to, but not including, the item if any that indicates an intersection.  So, when I aggregate the results, the intersecting item is not there.p  pIt looks like one way that people have handled this situation before has been to write a TakeUntil extension that is like TakeWhile, but it includes the first item that fails the predicate.  Would such a TakeUntil extension force an evaluation of the entire sequencep  pThis has mainly been an exercise to see if this algorithm could be implemented using Linq subject to the following requirements 1.  Entire sequence of input points is iterated ONLY if the input point is NOT on any of the segments. 2.  If the input point is on one of the segments, the iteration over the input points should stop.  If the input point is on the first segment of a 1000 point polygon, there is no need to do the intersection and on calculations for the rest the segments.p  pWe have implemented this algorithm previously in C using a for loop over the points, breaking out if the point is ever on a segment.  I could certainly implement the same way, I just wanted to see if I could LINQify if without incurring more interations than the old for loop way.p  pI will probably try the TakeUntil approach just for kicks and see what happens.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pWith this code TakeWhileInclusive IEnumerable that is virtually identical to the TakeUntil described in the link about TakeWhile PLUS one more elementp  precode Mimic TakeWhiles overload which takes an index as a parameter to the predicate. public static IEnumerableltTgt TakeWhileInclusiveltTgtthis IEnumerableltTgt seq, FuncltT, int, boolgt predicate    int i  0   foreach T e in seq        if predicatee,i             If here, then this is first item to fail predicate.

I will note again that my PointOnSegment code is bogus, but is fine for testing as long as I am testing a point that is equal to one of the polygon points.p  pI will leave this for now in case anyone else wants to comment.

Negative 603 pIm looking for some advice in dealing with UI, specifically web UI, where a multitude of different settings and toggles change what is displayed to the user. The settings are tied to the user, so each user has a unique experience depending on a variety of factors.

Like a list of options, and the user doesnt have access to all of them maybe some are disabled, maybe some are invisible.li ulli ul  pThe question is how do I keep the view as clean as possible while maintaining the context and intent of the view  Do I create separate handlers that output specific HTML if they are chained together through some authorization provider  If so, how do I work with features that are shared among multiple groups, but may change emslightlyem from one to the otherp  pI dont know that it matters what platform Im developing on, so examples or suggestions in any particular language or framework are fine.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr For example, say I have codeProductViewModelcode in Cp  precodepublic class ProductViewModel     public bool DisplayPrice  get set   codepre  pIn my view, then, I can check if codeModel.DisplayPrice  truecode, and if so, display the products price.  At this level, I dont care emwhyem its being displayed.  So, this would replace something like codeif  UserInRoleVendor  UserInRoleDistributor code.p  pObviously Id need some way to change this setting based on context.  Ideally, I want to avoid ever having the conditional statement codeif  UserInRoleVendor  UserInRoleDistributor code because the list of conditions can grow quickly.  For instance, say I want to display the price to vendors, but only if they have VIP access, and have been a user for more than 30 days, and have made previous purchases, and..p  pAny best practices, or suggestions, for modifyingstacking the settings at runtime, per user  Anyone with experience implementing preferences with a huge number of permutationsp

I might also add an annotation codeApplicationMonitorPlugincode so that a .jar file can have a test ApplicationMonitorFactory that does not get instantiatedp  pstrongDoes this sound reasonablestrongp  hr  h22. for each plugin, run ith2  pI did this once a while back, and if I remember right I think I need to use a custom classloader to add the appropriate .jar file to the classpath dynamically.

Negative 603 pIm compiling a swf using Flex 4.1 SDK that loads another swf that is created by a designer using Flash CS5.  The 4.1 swf throws an error, VerifyError Error 1053 Illegal override of removeChildBridge in mx.managers.SystemManagerProxy.  A few people around the web have said that they had this same error when their 4.1 swfs were loading swfs compiled by earlier versions of Flex.  The solution is to recompile the loaded swfs using the latest version of Flex.  So, Im guessing that I simply need to get Flash CS5 to publish for Flash Player 10.1.  Ive updated CS5, but still dont have the option to publish for the latest player.  How can I configure Flash to publish for Flash Player 10.1p

Negative 603 pThis is a rather broad question, Im looking for any document that contains an estimate or otherwise tries to formulate an answer.  Published research would be awesome.  When I say false negative, I mean a test result which is logged as a failure, but wasnt actually due to codedefect in the Applicationundertest. p  pFor context  Weve relied on integrationlevel test automation for a while, and weve always had a certain number of false negatives in our results.  Management seems to think that the number of false negatives can and should be zero.

The program I was profiling originally not a fibonacci calculator pegs all four cores on my cpu at 100 and I was doing profiling runs lasting up to 5 minutes. These had the same results and methods from my application did not appear high up on the hot spot method list.p  pIt varies from run to run but ConnectionHandler.run is always at the top and usually accounts for 99 of the profile time.p  pstrongSecond Editstrong I have tried using the sampler and I am now getting results that are consistent with what JProfiler is producing. The downside to this is that I dont get the stack trace information that comes with profiling. But for my immediate needs this is excellent.p  pSomething I have discovered while playing around is that VisualVM counts wallclock time for method calls while profiling them. p  pIn my specific case my application has a main thread which launches worker threads and immediately blocks waiting for a message on a queue.p  pThis means that the blocking method will appear to take up almost all of the time on the profiler despite the fact that it is not this method that is eating up my CPU.p  pI would expect that the same is true of the sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransportConnectionHandler.run method which does its job nicely  but when it terminates it becomes one of the longest running methods in my application  emrepeatedlyem.p

These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.   ltIfModule mpmwinnt.cgt ltIfModule mpmnetware.cgt   If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run  httpd as root initially and it will switch.     UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.   . On SCO ODT 3 use User nouser and Group nogroup.   . On HPUX you may not be able to use shared memory as nobody, and the     suggested workaround is to create a user www and use that user.   NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgidGroup or semctlIPCSET   when the value of unsignedGroup is above 60000    dont use Group 1 on these systems  User nobody Group 1 ltIfModulegt ltIfModulegt    ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin youyour.address    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, servergenerated  redirections will not work.  See also the UseCanonicalName directive.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  You will have to access it by its address anyway, and this will make   redirections work in a sensible way.  ServerName new.host.name80    UseCanonicalName Determines how Apache constructs selfreferencing   URLs and the SERVERNAME and SERVERPORT variables.  When set Off, Apache will use the Hostname and Port supplied  by the client.  When set On, Apache will use the value of the  ServerName directive.  UseCanonicalName Off    DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your  documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.  DocumentRoot varwebroothtdocs    Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect  to which services and features are allowed andor disabled in that  directory and its subdirectories.    First, we configure the default to be a very restrictive set of   features.    ltDirectory gt     AuthName Heatpump     AuthType Digest     AuthDigestFile varwebroot.htdigest     AuthDigestGroupFile varwebroot.htgroup         Require validuser     Satisfy All     Options FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride All ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.

The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see  httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.0modcore.htmloptions  for more information.      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks    AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.  It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords    Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit      AllowOverride All    Controls who can get stuff from this server.

UserDir publichtml    DirectoryIndex sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory  is requested.   The index.html.var file a typemap is used to deliver content  negotiated documents.  The MultiViews Option can be used for the   same purpose, but it is much slower.  DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var    AccessFileName The name of the file to look for in each directory  for additional configuration directives.  See also the AllowOverride   directive.  AccessFileName .htaccess    The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being   viewed by Web clients.   ltFiles  .htgt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all ltFilesgt    TypesConfig describes where the mime.types file or equivalent is  to be found.  TypesConfig confmime.types    DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a document  if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.  If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, textplain is  a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications  or images, you may want to use applicationoctetstream instead to  keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are  text.  DefaultType textplain    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile  directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.  ltIfModule modmimemagic.cgt     MIMEMagicFile confmagic ltIfModulegt    HostnameLookups Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses  e.g., www.apache.org on or 204.62.129.132 off.  The default is off because itd be overall better for the net if people  had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that  each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the  nameserver.  HostnameLookups Off    ErrorLog The location of the error log file.  If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog varloghttpderrorlog    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.  LogLevel warn    The following directives define some format nicknames for use with  a CustomLog directive see below.  LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti combined LogFormat h l u t r gts b common LogFormat Refereri gt U referer LogFormat Useragenti agent   You need to enable modlogio.c to use I and O LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio    The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.  If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do  define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be  logged therein and not in this file.  CustomLog varloghttpdaccesslog common    ServerTokens  This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response  Header. The default is Full which sends information about the OSType  and compiled in modules.  Set to one of  Full  OS  Minor  Minimal  Major  Prod  where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.  ServerTokens Full    Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host  name to servergenerated pages internal error documents, FTP directory   listings, modstatus and modinfo output etc., but not CGI generated   documents or custom error documents.

The format is   Alias fakename realname   Note that if you include a trailing  on fakename then the server will  require it to be present in the URL.  So icons isnt aliased in this  example, only icons.  If the fakename is slashterminated, then the   realname must also be slash terminated, and if the fakename omits the   trailing slash, the realname must also omit it.   We include the icons alias for FancyIndexed directory listings.  If you  do not use FancyIndexing, you may comment this out.  Alias icons varwebrooticons  ltDirectory varwebrooticonsgt     Options Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt    ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.

This is  always a good idea and opens the door for future internationalisation  of your web site, should you ever want it. Specifying it as  a default does little harm as the standard dictates that a page  is in iso88591 latin1 unless specified otherwise i.e. you  are merely stating the obvious. There are also some security  reasons in browsers, related to javascript and URL parsing  which encourage you to always set a default char set.

So doesnt cas allow only one operation to happen on the same object , and stops  strongblockstrong  others those want to operate on the same object  Sorry for so many doubts... please clarify...p  pstrongEDITstrong what happens when i have a structure to update  does it also  supported by hardware  No right, So doesnt language would be acquiring locks at some level to make these structure operation atomic br About strongJAVAstrong  there are AtomicReference and AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater class which provides updation to a object  structure or any kind of object , so can we compare them in terms of performance i mean speed  Both in tern uses Unsafe class which uses Native class . p

I studied the code for 12 hour but couldnt get at all what it is doing. I know I dont need to understand the logic behind this. But what if I want to create some advanced effects like this Its always good to study whats going under the hood. Has anybody written a blog post explaining what is this code or any book where the author teaches this type of real life stuff Or if you all have the time can you explain me what is it doingp  pThanks in advance p

Negative 603 pI want to access a C function that returns a struct containing double arrays where the lengths of these arrays is given by other int members of the struct from python.

I played around with the NumPy SWIG interface file but couldnt get any of the typemaps like code DATATYPE INPLACEARRAY1, int DIM1 code to work I think its not possible to get them to match in this case but Id be happy to be proven wrong.p  pMy guess is Id have to hand code initialization of the NumPy arrays as codePyArrayObjectcode for these members and SWIG extend my struct to make them accessible in Python That looks like a lot of work. Can anyone see a nicer way using SWIG It would be possible to change the struct or the method returning it if that made things easier.p  pAlternatively I had a look at cython and ctypes. Would these be better suited for what Im trying to achieve I havent used cython so cant judge its wrapping capabilities. For ctypes I can roughly imagine how to do it, but it means writing by hand what I had hoped a reasonably automated wrapper could do for me.p  pAny suggestions gratefully receivedp

Negative 603 pHi Im doing a validation on my server side and I return a JSON object with validation errors. Then the simple jQuery function writes the errors in a corresponding div p  precodefunction processEmaildata      newEmailError.htmldata.newEmail     newEmailVerificationError.htmldata.newEmailVerification     changeEmailMessage.htmldata.success   codepre  pThat should work fine, but now I test my application and write some wrong email address and I got a correct error message. Everything looks right. But now I adjust my email and send form and should get only the success message, but I see both messages. It just looks like divs always got the last value if there is no corresponding message. I thought that for example, if the data.newEmail is null  there is no validation error, and that object is null the newEmailError div will get a null value  will be empty. But it just omits that. Now I have to write my function like this and use .empty   p  precodefunction processEmaildata      newEmailError.empty     newEmailVerificationError.empty     changeEmailMessage.empty     newEmailError.htmldata.newEmail     newEmailVerificationError.htmldata.newEmailVerification     changeEmailMessage.htmldata.success   codepre  pIs there a better way to solve this problem and not use the jQuery .empty functionp  pThanksp
Negative 603 pI am currently working on a Django development. There is a problem, which isnt a true problem but very annoying.

Basically, what happened is that the browser has a http request timeout. If it doesnt receive a response within the timeout, it will close down the connection with the server. p  pI find this timeout isnt really needed, indeed causing headache, during debugging. Is there any way I can lift this timeout or increase it for my browser Chrome Or maybe a substitute browser that doesnt have this constraintp  pemNote Although I am using Django and have mentioned about it, this isnt a Djangorelated question.

Negative 603 pIm making a subclass of UIView completely in code no IB, lets call it strongContentViewstrong. In this view Ive already set up several players for sounds and video, as well as several imageViews nothing special.p  pNext, I was planning to subclass strongContentViewstrong several times in order to load different media for each view.

The only thing I can think of, in order to solve this problem is inheriting from a basic, jsonconverter class, and calling the base.serialize method instead...

Negative 603 pIm working on a UDP serverclient configuration.  The client sends the server a single packet, which varies in size but is usually lt500 bytes.  The server responds essentially instantly with a single outgoing packet, usually smaller than the incoming request packet.  Complete transactions always consist of a single packet exchange.p  pIf the client doesnt see the response within T amount of time, it retries R times, increasing T by X before each retry, before finally giving up and returning an error.  Currently, R is never changed.p  pIs there any special logic to choosing optimum initial T wait time, R retries, and X wait increase  How persistent should retries be ie, what minimum R to use to reach some approximation of a reliable protocolp

Negative 603 pI have an issue when plotting using an area graph with stacking normal. My last question I asked here was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7197487highchartshelpareachartstackingHighcharts help  Area chart stackingap  pWhich was basically asking how to plot the values to stack without normalizing the data. I was told I could subtract the one series from the other to make the graph appear properly, however, the values when you hover are skewed because of this calculation.p  pExample Beforep  precodeSeries Total      [0,0,0,1,1,2,3] Series InService [0,0,0,0,0,1,2] codepre  pSo I fix the data to graph itp  precodeSeries Total      [0,0,0,1,1,1,1] Series InService [0,0,0,0,0,1,2] codepre  pNow it graphs fine but the tool tip is wrong, for example the last data point should bep  precodeSeries Total      3 Series InService 2 codepre  pBut it showsp  precodeSeries Total      1 Series InService 2 codepre  pAnd since the tooltip does not have access to the other points we cant do a fix calculation to display it. Unless I use shared true, but I cant use shared because the tooltip is too massive because of all the series I have.p  pPlease ask any questions if I am unclear, I really need some help.p

Negative 603 pI am working on a program that I will send to someone as email attachment using yahoo web mail as we all do. That guy will execute that app and a keylogger which is a part of that app will be implanted in his pc. The keylogger will sense when the victim enters an email id and password when he does, the keylogger will send this info to me via email.p  pEverything is done except this email thing. I do not know how to make this program able to send an email without using any email client or opening a browser. I have searched like hell over the internet but could not find a working thing I do not have any knowledge of socks, or winsock, etc.p  pI am using C Builder XE.p
Negative 603 pOk, I used a workaround for something similar to this last night...but a workaround wont suffice for my new situation, so I figured I should find out what Im missing.p  pI have a UIViewController that has a main UIView item, and 2 UIButton objects and a UIImageView.  I have the Files Owner set to my view controller class.  The ViewController has a class variable IBOutlet UIImageView  backgroundImage.  I have set the outlet in Interface Builder such that the UIImageView references the backgroundImage property.p  pI would assume at this point that I should be able to change the UIImageView item.  However, this is not the case.  I can set it in code, and my app does NOT blow up due to a lack of outlet setting or anything, but the image simply doesnt change.  I was trying something VERY similar to this last night where I had a UIView within the root UIView item of the ViewController and I was trying to reference that to a class variable to specifically control that view.

Negative 603 pIm flummoxed with what I believe is a seeminglysimple theoretical question about SAP BusinessObjects  Crystal Reports store their data sources, to help me change them to integrate with our new upgrade of Maximo.p  pstrongOne Sentence Summarystrong I cant find where SAP BusinessObjects or Crystal Reports cache their datasource information so I can change it all I can see is a datasource name and nothing about its serverport, etc.p  pstrongBrief backgroundstrongp  ul liIm new to Crystal Reports and Maximo, but not enterprise systems, development, or reporting in generalli liI came in to a company that uses crystal reports to integrate with IBM Maximo asset management on an Oracle databaseli liThe only guy who set it up is gone, with little or no documentationli liIm essentially cleaning up the mess but were going through an upgrade and I have to understand this system to make it work postupgrade.li liI cant guarantee that anything about our setup is standard or anywhere near a best practice.li ul  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  ul liWe are upgrading our Maximo system 5.2 to a new version 7.1.li liWe have 150 Crystal reports querying these older systems that I need to point to the new database to testli liWhen I look at the data source for an individual crystal report opened from the file system, the data source seems to be cached only the data source name Maximo, username and PW are there.li liI cant find where this elusive Maximo data source is located. Nothing I can find in the Crystal Report file, in the SAP BusinessObjects web site, or on the server really points me to the actual location of the DB so I can change it.li ul  pstrongPlaces Ive Searchedstrongp  ul listrongFor an ODBC Connection on the serverstrong This could be promising so Im leading with it, but I didnt start here. There is an ODBC connection on the server for oracle, called MAXPROD, but it too doesnt indicate the server information it just says that the server is MAXPROD, with a username and password field. No indication of anything else about the connection.li listrongIn the Crystal Reports .rpt filestrong On the data source selection screen, the initial option is select data source, but none of the data sources listed are related to Oracle or Maximo makes sense as my machine doesnt have any local DSNs. However, if I click Next, I see cached server information with the SID MAXPROD and a field for user ID and password. No mention of the server name, port, driver, DB type, etc. It appears to be cached ODBC information but I cant tell where its stored.li listrongIn the source of the .rpt filestrong No luck, as its not a text file. I was hoping it might be pure XML.li listrongIn a tnsnames filestrong I figured since its an Oracle DB, it might be stored in a tnsnames.ora file which is where the ODBC and Crystal might be looking. But the only tnsnames files I found were samples or were specifically for unrelated datasources different servers, etc.li listrongIn the BussinesObjects XI CMC web site configuration sectionstrong Again, here I am able to find a database connection, where it allows me to select an ODBC connection, but appears to have one cached called MAXIMO that I cant edit.li ul  pIm at my wits end. Can anyone think of anywhere I havent looked, or is the problem actually how Im looking at the situation any help would be greatly appreciated.p

In this manner, a single codeXCopyAreacode containing the changed area is performed stronglocallystrong on the server that is, the display.pli lipHow should actual changes on the visual display be synchronized to avoid artefacts that where not present in the graphics described The irregular flicker you see is not a privilege of PostScript, it seems to be present in any doublebuffered system I have seen so far.

Negative 603 pIm writing a game using android ndk. Im using picking to select objects in opengl. For that i have an offscreen framebuffer object where i render into and i use glReadPixels to get the color from the FBO.

Negative 603 pI currently have a tricky bug that occurs in a place where I dont have access to source or symbols, i.e. I can see the instruction and its address where the crash occurs, but thats about it. strongWhat Id like to do is have codegdbcode run without requiring interaction and display every instruction as it does sostrong, but Ive yet to find a way to do it.p  pWhat Im hoping to achieve is something like thisp  precodegdb  some command  0x2818a7c0 push   ebp 0x2818a7c1 mov    esp,ebp 0x2818a7c3 push   ebx 0x2818a7c4 sub    0x4,esp ... 0x28563622 mov    esi,0x0eax Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. codepre  pWhat Ive been doing is setting up a display for the program counter, like sop  precodegdb displayi pc codepre  pAnd then running through the code with codestepicodep  precodegdb stepi 1 xi pc  0x2818a7c0 push   ebp codepre  pHowever, the crash is hundreds or thousands of instructions away, and Id like a way to see each one together, if preferable, without having to hit enter that many times.

Negative 603 pIm trying to use the jQuery datepicker control to show only the Day, Month and date to the user, something like p  blockquote   pFri. Aug. 24p blockquote  pBut behind the scenes I need to track the year. To accomplish this I tried using the altField option and having the altField format be mmddyyyy. p  pIt is updating the altField as expected but it fails when the user spans a year. For example if today is 1182012 and I pick any date in 2012 it works perfect. If i pick 312013 in the calendar control it updates the altField correctly but as soon as i open the calendar again 312012 is selected. p  pIt looks like the datepicker control doesnt look to the altField to set the value of the popup calendar. p  pI tried reading and parsing the date in the altField onSelect and beforeShow and then setting the date of the normal control to the parsed date but it basically ignores the set. I end up on the date reflected in the datepicker textbox and not the altField. p  pAnyone ever tried to wire something like this up before p  pFor an example of the setup check out Google Hotel Search  a hrefhttpwww.google.comhotelfinder relnofollowhttpwww.google.comhotelfinderap

Negative 603 pI have a backbone model called codeMembercode  this contains membership data such as first name, last name, email, phone, etc. It also includes multivalued fields that I need to keep as collections  these are codeDegreescode and codeAffiliationscode.p  pThe issue I am running into when calling the codefetchcode method in my model is that theres an impedance mismatch of sorts between a basic array, and the collection objects I have in my model. Since codeparsecode by definition is supposed to return a hash to be used in codesetcode rather than actually setting values, it is impossible for me to set my collections this way. For instance  if I return a JavaScript object for codeDegreescode that looks something like the following codedegrees [id 1, title PhD]code, then this converts my codedegreecode collection into a flat array.

Negative 603 pWhen you apply a number of Core Image filters to an image, memory can quickly become a limiting factor and often leading to a crash of the application. I was therefore wondering what a good approach is to add one filter at a time and wait for each operation to complete.p  pThe example that I am working on involves one photo to which the user can apply various effectsfilters. The user is presented with a small thumbnail to get an idea of what each filter looks like. When all the filters are applied at one, the application runs out of its assigned amount of memory and crashes.p  pIn short, how do I go about applying one filter at a time and be notified when the operation is complete so I can apply the next filter to the next thumbnailp

Negative 603 pThis is an extension to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3114826isitpossibletoforcerowlevellockinginsqlserver3114834comment138067693114834Is it possible to force row level locking in SQL Servera. Here is the use casep  pI have accounts table having account numbers, balances, etc. This table is being used by many applications. It is quite possible that while I am modifying an account, someone else is modifying another account. So the expected behavior is that I would lock my accountROW and the other use will lock hisanother ROW. p  pBut SQL Server 2008 R2 escalates this locking to pagetable and the second user gets timeout exception. I have tried all the solutions mentioned in the referenced question but nothing is working. p  pHow can I force SQL Server to lock a rowlevel lock only OR how can I modify this model in a way that it will work with pagetable locking p  pstrongEDITstrong The update is targeting a single record via its PK and it is indexed so only ONE ROW is being updatedlocked and the process takes not more than a minutep  pstrongEditstrong  Now it looks something weird is happening. I am using an ORM library for DAL which is opening more than one connections and i have raised the question to their support.

Negative 603 pIm new to JavaScript, and I searched around for a solution to my problem. Im really struggling to find the right answer. I think I might have to do something with callbacks, but Im not sure.p  pBasically, I am implementing a like button on my website. On clicking the like button, I need two main backend things to happen The database of likes should be updated, and an email notification should be sent to the person who got a like. After clicking the like button, I render a liked button to show the user that it went through.p  pProblem is, shooting the email takes a long time. So if I update the database and then send the email and emthenem render the button, the user will be waiting a bit before heshe sees the button changed to a liked button. So instead, I would like to update the database, render the like button, and emthenem shoot the email.p  pIn my JavaScript, I tried doing the followingp  precodefunction foo    xmlhttp1.onreadystatechange  liked function      xmlhttp2.openPOST, asyncasynclikeEmail.php,true     xmlhttp2.setRequestHeader...     ...     xmlhttp2.sendparameters       xmlhttp1.openPOST, asyncasynclikeUpdateDB.php, true   xmlhttp1.setRequestHeader...   ...   xmlhttp1.sendparameters   function likedcallback    if xmlhttp1.readyState  4        xmlhttp1.responseText     someElement.innerHTML  xmlhttp1.responseText  render the liked button     callback     codepre  pDoing it this way, the asynchronous liked function fails to get called. For some reason, passing in a callback breaks it. Ive also tried not passing in a callback and instead, defining a separate likenotify function, and calling likenotify inside of the asynchronous liked function also fails. p  pCan someone let me know what Im doing wrong and why these attempts have failed Are callbacks not the solution to this problemp

Negative 603 pI am aware about the concepts of data type or structure alignment, packing, padding issues etc. I have implemented a single linked list where each node occupies approximately 250 bytes i.e. around 4 times the size of cache line of 64 bytes. My machine is a Intel 64 bit architecture.p  pNow a single linked list is essentially a pointer chasing data structure and thus suffers from high number of cache misses. In order to reduce the cache misses, I aligned each data structure node using posixmemalign function to cache lined boundary of 64 bytes. Now all linked list nodes are cache aligned.p  pAfter doing this, I find that memory consumption of linked list has increased considerably and also the performance has actually deteriorated. Can anyone explain what could be possibly going wrong p

The jsons passed from the server to the phone are OK without any date difference I checked both the phone and the server for correct time zones. they are both correct Israel GMT3p  pThe same problem occurs with all clients, so the problem must be with either the windows operating system on which the glassfish sits, or with the glassfish server....

Deduping the items in the array that carry a duplicate flag and NOT a reference flag is quite challenging though. As mergesort is a stable sort I tried resorting by boolean flag but did not get what I expected. I used a codeTStringlistcode to see if my previous flags are being set up correctly and it works perfectly. The time went up from 1 second to 6 seconds. I know there has to be an easy way to mark the codeisUniquecode flag strongwithoutstrong codeTStringlistcode.p  pHere is what I triedp  precodefunction DeDupevar PRecords array of PCustomRecord iLength int64 Integer var   i  Integer begin   for i  0 to HighPRecords do   begin     if PRecords[i].isrefrence  False and PRecords[i1].isrefrence  falsethen     begin       Result  AnsiCompareStrPRecords[i].isduplicate, PRecords[i1].isduplicate       if Result  0 then PRecords[i].isUnique  True     end     else     begin       Continue     end   end end codepre  pThis doesnt get all the values and I did not see a difference with it as I still see lots of duplicates. I think the logic is wrong.p  pThanks to all the great souls helping out. To all please allow me the benefit that I may already know how to derive a codeTObjectcode and how to use a codeTStringListcode so the focus is on arrays. p  pQUESTION Help me do a function or procedure as above to mark the repeated items with the  emisRefrence  false and isDuplicate  True and uniqueemp  pEDIT 3 I was able to achieve the elimination of duplicates through the use of boolean flags. this helped in keeping the array stable without changing the size of the array. I believe it is much much faster than using codeTListcode descendant or codeTStringListcode. The use of a basic container such as an array has limitations in ease of coding but is very efficient so I would not pass on it. The pointers made the sorting a breeze.

Negative 603 pI need to make stock control, so I need to ensure that when I modified the amount of product, is doing in the right way. I am using Entity framework 4.0p  pFor example, if I use a transaction, when I load the record from the database, the recored is blocked, so I can substract or add to the loaded amount, the number of items that I need. However, this block the record in the database and perhaps for performance reasons is not the best way. This makes me ask when to use transactions with EF.p  pThe other option is to use the concurrency fixed of entity framework, using a timespan column to detect if the record has been changed. In this case, if the record has been modified between my load and my update, I get the exception of concurrency. But it could occur that in my exception handler, if I update my context with the database data, between my refresh and the savechanges could be changed again.p  pOther problem is I finally can save the changes. For example, I have 10 units, I need to substract 8 but between my load and my update, other person substract 5 units. If I subtract 8, then in stock I have 3 units. This is not possible. If I have a transaction, I load the record, is blocked, so I can check if I have enough units, if yes, I can subtrack, if not, I send an exception.p  pSo my question is, I know that EF is a transaction by itself, but it exists also transactions in EF, so it would be useful in some cases. When to use EF and cocurrency fixed and when to use transactionsp  pThanks. Daimroc.p

Negative 603 pAs you know Microsoft just removed the whole strongSystem.Net.Socketsstrong on strong.Net for Windows store appsstrong and now you should use strongStreamSocketListenerstrong if you want strongTcpListenerstrong, strongStreamSocketstrong for strongTcpClientstrong, etc. At the first time it may look like you lost TcpClient and those stuff but to me StreamSocket is pretty enjoyable and I want to use it in my Windows Forms and WPF applications for regular desktop versions as well. and here is my question is it possible to use Windows.Networking.Sockets.StreamSocket and those stuff on WinForms and WPF .Net 4.5 and not .Net for Windows store apps because then I can write the same code for both of them. Besides StreamSocket is more handy.p

Negative 603 pI have a plugin that imports csv data into wordpress tables. It runs through the Wordpress dashboard where you input some details and click a button to execute it.p  pIve altered the plugin so that the input data is staticfrom the same csv every time and is now all located in one php file. I want to schedule a Cron job to execute this script every hour or so.p  pI tried to set it up using cPanel and directly accessing the php file but it does not worknothing is displayed. I believe this is because the plugin uses wordpress functions such as wpinsertpost.p  pHow can i run this script, as if it were run through wordpress dashboard, as a scheduled eventp  pNote the file also contains some javascript.p

Negative 603 pI have a C program that runs as a linux service.  Some of the programs command line options simply set values in its configuration files and then exit, which then require the service to restart to pick up the new config.  In order to allow the service to continue running uninterrupted, it works as followsp  ul libackground service starts on system boot ul libackground service creates a config watchdog thread monitoring config filesli ulli liuser runs progname options from command line ul liconfig files modifiedli licommand line instance of program exitsli libackground service config watchdog thread detects changes to config, triggers restartli ulli ul  pWhen the program restarts after reading the new config, I am calling execv so that it will remain in the same process space as the original instance, so that it can continue to be managed as a service.  The problem is that execv is not behaving as expected, and it is instead terminating the existing process and restarting in a new one.  Because the PID no longer matches, if I attempt to run service progname stoprestart after this point, it will not work properly, stop will leave the service running, and restart will spawn a duplicate instance of the program.p  pI have confirmed that argv[0] being passed to execv is the full path to the executable, so it should not be searching for the executable in the PATH via the shell which should also be prevented by the fact that Im using execv instead of execvp which I have read about causing similar problems in other applications.p

A user downloads many programs and a program is downloaded by many users. Same goes for the comments A user comments on many programs and a program is commented or rated by many users. The best practice as far as I know is to create a third table which is one to many a relationship table.  . I suppose that in this design the average rating and comment retrieval is done by join queries or something similar.  Im a total noob in database design but I try to adhere to best practices , is this design more or less ok or am I overlooking something p  pI can definitely think of other possibilities  maybe comment andor rating can be an entitytable by itself and the relationships are between 3 entities. Im not really sure what the benefitsdrawbacks of that are I know that I dont really care about the comments or the ratings , I only want to display them where appropriate and maintain themdelete when needed , so how do I know if they better become an entity themselvesp  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 603 pI saw many examples where XHTML  were used in RESTful API for authorization with OAuth or OpenID. While this seems quite natural I asked myself strongif there are other advantages where submitting forms is better then POSTingPUTing a representation of the resourcestrong  Im mostly interested in machinetomachune interaction then humantomachine.p  pIf I understand it well, one of the aspects is the contentnegotiation where XHTML forms can be returned to the client or not because by default JSON and XML doesnt support forms depending on the codeAcceptcode header in the request.p  pLets say we have a simple scenario where an codeItemcode resource could be added to the codeCartcode resource. The API supports only JSON and XML. What Im generally doing is I want the client to codePOSTcode an codeItemcode resource representation to the codeCartcode resource and this works great. However the client should be aware of the semantics and need to know exactly the structure of the codeItemcode resource representation because otherwise it will encounter error 400 Bad request.p  pThen I thought then using forms would be easier strongas they provide some guidancestrong to the client on what to post to the codeCartcode. But then there is a problem, because  are supported OOTB by XHTML for example but not JSON or XML unless using something like CollectionJSON etc.. I could then provide some custom implementation in order to support forms in JSON and XML but this would require client to understand the semantics and there is strongno gain in using forms over posting the resource representationstrong.p  pstrongQuestion strong Could you please clarify if there are scenarios where forms should be used, or the usage is preferable over POSTing a resource representation  Is there any official guidance p  pstrongQuestion 2 strong Would you bother using forms in XHTML format where mostly all communication between API and clients is in JSON or XML, or would you modify XMLJSON in order to contain custom forms p  pMaybe Im missing something about that, so dont hesitate to put me on the right tracks p

Negative 603 pI recently upgraded from EF 4.3.1 to 4.4 and something odd started happening.  I have touched the code since the upgrade, so I cant say with 100 certainty that it was that which caused this issue.  p  pAnyway, when I blow away the existing database and call UpdateDatabase from the PM console, it creates a database, but with the fullyqualified name of my context.

Negative 603 pIm developing for Unity3D using C, and decided it would be useful to have an assert function. In Unity3D, codeSystem.Diagnostics.Debug.Assertcode emexistsem, but does nothing.p  pAs a developer that works primarily in C, Im used to assert messages that contain the asserted expression by way of the preprocessor stringizing operator. That is, given a failed assertion of the form codeASSERTx gt 0, x should not be zero.code, the message displayed at runtime message can include the text x  0. Id like to be able to do the same in C.p  pIm aware of ConditionalAttribute and DebuggerHiddenAttribute, and am using both although the latter seems to be ignored by the custom build of MonoDevelop bundled with Unity. While searching for a solution to this problem, I came across three attributes in the codeSystem.Runtime.CompilerServicescode namespace that seem related to what Im trying to do CallerFilePathAttribute, CallerLineNumberAttribute, and CallerMemberNameAttribute. In my implementation, I use codeSystem.Diagnostics.StackTracecode with codefNeedFileInfo  truecode instead.p  pIm wondering if there is perhaps any reflection magic seems unlikely or attribute magic seems slightly more likely that can help me achieve the same functionality as Im used to in C.p

Negative 603 pAs far as I looked, theres no answered question about QTPs Ext. sdk on stackoverflow and almost anywhere else on the net there isnt even a appropriated tag for it..., so Im aware its unlikely I get my problem solved by asking , but whatever, it worth trying.p  pAnyway, before I lose the attention of anyone who never heard or used the Ext. sdk, maybe I will have more luck asking you to help me figure out how to locate the error log file QTP produces at runtime. I know such a file exists in the new UFT 11.5 version, but I couldnt locate it in QTP 10 or 11 For the record, I dont talk about QTPs Log Tracking feature, but about the meta error log of errorsexceptions produced by QTP itself.p  pNow for the question Im developing an extension for QTP to support native record and run tests on my application. Im currently able to import an object repository, and write test steps using The COM object testing agent I developed. Problem started when I was trying to implement the IRecordable interface Im getting the IRecorder object from qtp, and even able to use it as ISuppressor object to exclude redundant steps from being recorded, but all my attempts to record a step that is, to add new recorded objects to the repository, and add steps to the test simply failed.p  pThis is the code that Im usingp  precodepublic class MyTestingAgent      AutInterface.ITestable,      AutInterface.IRecordable      QTPInterface.IRecorder recorder     ...      public void AutInterface.IRecordable.BeginRecordingobject recorder              IRecordSuppressor recordSuppressor  recorder as IRecordSuppressor         recordSuppressor.SuppressMyTestingAgentId,              ltSuppressgtltItem typeHWND value[HWND] gtltSuppressgt.Replace[HWND], getMyAppHWND.ToString          this.recorder  recorder as QTPInterface.IRecorder         ...           public void recordNewObjStepstring parentName, string objName, string method, Object[] arguments               object[] objectHyrarchy  new object[]  findObjectIdobjName, findObjectIdparentName          string externalParent  null         string appDescriptionXml  getDescriptionXmlparentName, objName         try                      recorder.RecordMyTestingAgentId, objectHyrarchy , appDescriptionXml, externalParent, method, arguments             Trace.TraceInformationRecord successfully done.                  catch Exception e                      Trace.TraceErrorTEAAgent.recordSTElement   e.ToString                   ...  codepre  pIm pretty sure all the arguments I send with the call to Record are accurate. getDescriptionXml and findObjectId are used in different cases in the code, and works fine, the method name and argument are correct.p  pThe annoying thing is that the call to Record doesnt even throw exception, and I get Record successfully done. in the trace log. Needless to say no new object is created in the repository, and no step is added to the test.p  pAs I cant debug QTP, Im pretty much in the dark with what Im doing wrong. Thats why Im asking for help with finding QTPs log file, or any other approach that might shed some light on the subject.p

Negative 603 pIm trying to update a codeCustomercode in my database using ASP.NET Web API and Entity Framework 5 codefirst, but its not working.

Ive built a web interface where users can add a customer by supplying the name and checking one or more customer types.

New associations are ignored and existing associations remain even if they should be deleted.p  pI had a similar problem when inserting a customer into the database, this was fixed when I adjusted the state of these entities to codeEntityState.Unchangedcode.

Negative 603 pso I have a question about checking if an object was instantiated using a particular constructor.I have a class called SearchWithTwoLevelCore that is part of a search engine. It has a constructor like thisp  precodepublic SearchWithTwoLevelCacheISearchCore s, ICurrentTimeProvider tp              Initialize the two levels.

Then I have a public method I want to run that resides inside SearchWithTwoLevelClass, but first I want to check to see if the constructor used to make SearchWithTwoLevelCache was the one above otherwise the method wont run properly and throw some sort of exception if it wasnt.

Negative 603 pI have an application that Id like to allow users to move to their SDCard. I have done this on a few previous applications without any trouble by adding the installLocationauto flag to the application block of the manifest. For some reason with my current app when I go into application settings I see the button move to SDCard but it is greyed out and not clickable. I was reading the official docs about install location and found a page that talks about a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsdatainstalllocation.htmlShouldNot relnofollowwhich apps should not allowa this feature. I guess my question is are there certain features that will actually disable this all together For instance Im using a SyncAdapter in my application and the doc says you should not allow move to SDCard when using a SyncAdapter but doesnt indicate that you cannot.p

Negative 603 pI was a bit curious to see if I could write a simple engine in Java2D to render a 3D cube. My attempt has, to my surprise, been successful so far. The cube looks pretty good so far img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvPhrq.png altenter image description herep  pBut, as you can see, I am seriously lacking depth testing. I am completely lost on how I could go about doing depth testing in Java2D though. From what I have found, you go about it by rendering each polygon to a bitmap then testing each pixel against every other pixel that is may conflict with. This is where I am lost.p  pI have the necessary depth values for each vertex of the polygons, but I dont have the depth values of each pixel. This is probably a side effect of letting Java2D fill each polygon for me using the fillPolygonPolygon p method.  So this leads me to believe I cannot do depth testing if I render my polygons using the fillPolygon.. method. My first question is that Can I do zbuffering while still being lazy and letting Java do my pixel drawingp  pIf not, then my next question is how in the world do I go about rendering the polygons on my own I mean, I know well enough how to store pixels in a bitmap then render them to an image. I am wondering how I can take the four vertices of each polygon and render them appropriately.p

This works, but is unacceptable because the publisher we are using will be too busy reupping pages.li liLogout button POSTs to Page A.  Page A kills the session and forwards the user to Page B with some You have been logged out message.  Back from Page B will pop the message browsers provide about having to repost values.  Yes  they log back out harmless at this point and get forwarded to Page B again.  No  they sit at Page A harmlessly.  But, back  no  back may land them on the cached page, or a selection from history would still show a cached page.li liLogout button pops a new window, asking if theyre surewarning them to close their session.  Im sure does a window.opener.reload or window.opener.close.  But, if JavaScript is disabled, were doomed.li liLogout posts to the current page.  All pages check the existence of some POSTd value.  If present, forward to Page B with a you have been logged out message.  Similar to 2.

Negative 603 pi.e Is there a way to print all attributes with attr and xattr  I want to see all the information metadata that is available to me about a file. For example, can I see the users MAC addresses who created andor have subsequently touched the file Can I see the date it was created and subsequently modified p  pBy metadata I think I mean all the information my system knows about the file, except for the contents of the file itself. i.e. date created, date modified, original author, all modifying authors inc. last touch if the system keeps that information, version history if its available etc. The file I am working with is adobe acrobat but I also want to know for other types of files. I am using OS X 10.8.5.p

Negative 603 pIve looked at lots of other questions on SO but cant get the answer.

If I use thisp  precode[ColumnSex  Male] public bool Sex  getset  codepre  pThis gives me the error of being incompatible with the model as the field Sex could not be found.  So I changed to thisp  precode[Column[Sex  Male]] public bool Sex  getset  codepre  pI then get the message Invalid Column Name [Sex  Male].  Does EF rename columns with spaces in some way as the field does exist and is not any kind of FKp  pEDITp  pI have found that doing this in the modelBuilderp  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltStudentgt.Propertyx gt x.Sex.HasColumnNameSex  Male codepre  pCauses the same error to appear saying its incompatible as there is no column called Sex with the same name  Ive noticed it occurs on anything I use the Column data annotation for not just this fieldp  pEDIT 2p  pI created a new application and used a Model Designer to see how it interpreted the column and showed it in the designer as Sex959595Male, however, changing the class to this even with []s around it still gives me could not find column Sex959595Malep  pEDIT 3p  pIt appears the error isnt quite what I thought, I found the mapping config works fine when I just use db.Students and the column is there as expected. It turns out the area going wrong is this line p  precodevar students  db as IObjectContextAdapter.ObjectContext.ExecuteStoreQueryltStudentgtsql codepre  pSo its clearly the ExecuteStoreQuery that Im guessing wont use the same mapping configuration therefore sees the column as missing.

Negative 603 pIm sorry to bother you with this question but I end up finding a head stomper, and I am wondering if Im dealing with this the wrong way.p  pI want to map a class containing a collection of codeorg.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthoritycode so that I dont need to send it eagerly loaded by the ORM, into the spring security classes. But its role attribute is associated with the getter getAuthority, and that is when Orika means trouble. Can I force Orika to use the values returned by a getter, to put it into a setter of the destination classp  pIf you care enough, heres a little context ot my problem.  Im using Spring security for an app. I have a service which returns a codeorg.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailscode so that spring can check if the user is authenticated and it has permissions. The implementation of UserDetail we have is a local one named codeUsercode. Since this class implements codeorg.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailscode, it has the method codepublic Collectionlt extends GrantedAuthoritygt getAuthoritiescode which returns the permissions for this user.p  pEverithing was well, except for the fact that we had this codeUsercode in the database, handled with hibernate. The first choices where to leave an open session in view. We dont want that. The second choice was to make the fetching of the ORM, EARGER. We didnt want that either. So, we decided to use a DTO, implementing UserDetail, and map it with orika. Thats when all hell broke loose. codeorg.springframework.security.core.GrantedAuthoritycode is an interface. The concrete class we are using is codeorg.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthoritycode. And this is an obscure and deadly class to map, because it has an attribute name role, but its getter is getAuthorityp  precodepublic String getAuthority      return role  codepre  pIt appears that the Spring team and the Orika team where not very close friends. Otherwise they wouldve name the property, according to the java standard, and orika wouldve mapped it straight forward. I am, also, reluctant to define a custom mapper for this particular case, and thats whats been bothering me. Is there any known way of forcing Orika to use the value returned by the getter method other than replacing all its magic with a custom mapper for a particular classp

Negative 603 pI am new to mysql and sql in general and am trying to see if I can make data inserted into a column in a table case insensitive. p  pI am storing data like state names, city names, etc. So I want to have a unique constraint on these types of data and on top of that make them case insensitive so that I can rely on the uniqueness constraint. p  pDoes mysql support a caseinsensitive option on either the column during table creation or alternatively when setting the uniqueness constraint on the column What is the usual way to deal with such issues I would appreciate any alternate ideassuggestions to deal with this.p  pEDIT As suggested, does COLLATE I think only applies to queries on the inserted data. But to really take advantage of the uniqueness contraint, I want to have a case insensitivity restriction on INSERT. For e.g. I want mysql to not allow insertions of California and california and cALifornia as they should be the same. But if I understand the uniqueness constraint prooperly, having it on the StateName will still allow the above four inserts.p

Negative 603 pI have written a python application which generates output in graphviz DOT format. I convert the generated file into PNG using the external dot utility and open the generated PNG in an image viewer to visualise the graph. p  pMy application is an interactive commandline tool which allows few operations on the graph like changing the colours of edges based on the edge weights, deleting few nodes, etc. After these operations I generate the DOT file again and convert it to PNG for visualisation. p  pI came across a hrefhttpsgithub.comjrfonsecaxdot.py relnofollowxdot.pya which allows me to embed the interactive viewer into my application. Now I do not have to go to the shell to generate the PNG every time.p  pI want to take this idea further and build a fullfledged GUI application on top of this. I have few questions regarding thisp  ul liDo I have to start from scratch use wxPython or any other GUI framework Use a canvas to display the generated image and refresh it whenever there are operations performed on the graph.li liIs there any other package which serves this purpose I am looking for some package which can edit the graph and just provide me with the ability to bind my graph operations to the mouse events on the viewer.li ul  pAny other ideas Greatly appreciate your inputs.p

My code is belowp  precodePublic Class Form1     Private Sub btnCalculateClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnCalculate.Click         Dim iNum, iSum As Double         Dim isPrime As Boolean  True         iNum  Convert.ToInt32tbxN.Text         For i  2 To iNum  1 Step 1             iSum  iNum Mod i         Next         If iSum  0 Then             isPrime  False             lblAnswer.Text  No         Else             isPrime  True             lblAnswer.Text  Yes         End If     End Sub End Class codepre  pI believe it may be an issue with my If statement and that the program is only using the last value in the loop to make the prime number decision, however, I need it where if iSum is EVER 0, then it is NOT Prime. If iSum is NEVER 0, then it IS Prime.p  pHow can I go about fixing this Thank youp

Negative 603 pI am new so I apologize if I ask my question wrong. I have 3 drop down select boxes. The first allows you to select the width, the second is length and the third has the height. They have preselected values. Each value when selected is set to be changed to a width, length or height that is closest to. These are going to standard sizes saved in a database. After selection I can get the variable to change to the closest size but I cannot get them passed with AJAX.

Negative 603 pMy question is more driven by what is the proper approach when dealing with partial views. Is there a token for each partial view, or the container as a whole p  pCurrently our form contains divs for 5 partial views. The user is responding to a list of certification questions, and based on responses 1 or more divspartial views are displayed. Each partial view is accepteddeclined button select and the form as a whole is submitted button. Currently, each partial view has its own AntiForgeryToken and corresponding token validation in the controller in the manner as you indicated. p  pWith this approach we periodically see the System.Web.Mvc.HttpAntiForgeryExceptionp  pIf I have a formview that will display 1 or more partial views based on user responses. Where do I need to place the AntiForgeryToken In the parent view In the partial views Bothp  pMy theory is that when multiple partial views are represented a mismatch of tokens occurs and the error is reported. My thinking is to move the token to the mainparent view.p  pAm I on the right track Anybody had to deal with something similar p

If I put an analogous chunk of code in my main.cpp file, I can verify that both the constructor and destructor will be called.p  pThe call stack when the constructor is called is as follows.p  precodemydll.dllmydllDLLDestructorTestDLLDestructorTest  Line 1093  C mydll.dllmydlldynamic initializer for DLLDestructorTestObj  Line 1100  0x26 bytes C msvcr90d.dllinittermvoid void  pfbegin0x000007fee7f521a8, void void  pfend0x000007fee7f52bf8  Line 903    C mydll.dllCRTINITvoid  hDllHandle0x000007fee7920000, unsigned long dwReason1, void  lpreserved0x00000000002cf580  Line 323 C mydll.dllDllMainCRTStartupvoid  hDllHandle0x000007fee7920000, unsigned long dwReason1, void  lpreserved0x00000000002cf580  Line 540  0x13 bytes  C mydll.dllDllMainCRTStartupvoid  hDllHandle0x000007fee7920000, unsigned long dwReason1, void  lpreserved0x00000000002cf580  Line 511    C codepre  pWhich is basically as described on this webpage a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary988ye33t.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary988ye33t.aspxa  This page give details on how you the constructor is called, but no details as to how the destructor is called. In the following paragraph, it mentions details about which functions are called to invoke the constructor, which I can see in my callstack.p  pThe CC runtime library code performs the DLL startup sequence, eliminating the need to link with a separate module as was necessary in Windows 3.x. Included in the CC runtime library code is the DLL entrypoint function called DllMainCRTStartup. The DllMainCRTStartup function does several things, including calling CRTINIT, which initializes the CC runtime library and invokes C constructors on static, nonlocal variables. Without this function, the runtime library would be left in an uninitialized state. CRTINIT is available for both a statically linked CRT or linking to the CRT DLL Msvcr90.dll, from a user DLL.p  pI found one post here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions75701whathappenstoglobalvariablesdeclaredinadllWhat happens to global variables declared in a DLLa, but this just seems to state that destructors will be called.p  pAny ideas as to why the destructors are not called would be appreciated.p  pThanks, John Lawriep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have looked at this and have read up about DLLs but still dont have the solution.  The DLL is linked implicitly with declspecdllexport.  As far as I understand, there is nothing special that I should need to do to unload the DLL.  It should unload automatically when the process terminates.p  pI made an very simple DLL by following the instructions on this page a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms235636vvs.90.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms235636vvs.90.aspxa.  I have no problems with the destructors getting called from this project.p  pI tried comparing what happens between this simple project and my current one. If I put the breakpoint in the simple test project DLL destructor, I can check out the call stack and see that the destructor is called fromp  precodecrtdll.c line 447 crtdll.c line 560 crtdll.c line 510 codepre  pIn my current project, I can see that it is going into a different DllMainCRTStartup function and begins executing at line 521.  It does eventually get to the same line of line 447 which is just functiontocall but my destructor does not get called.p  pIn case it is useful, the DLL Im calling is JUCE from juce.comp  pThanksp

Negative 603 pI am trying to learn a bit about passing data between applications using XML. I wrote a sub in Excel that generates an order from Spreadsheet data, and then writes the order to an XML file XML sample at end of question. I am now trying to write a function in Java to iterate through the file and print out the values. To do this, I test to see if a given node .hasChildNodes, and, if it does, I try to iterate through the child nodes too. But the test doesnt seem to work as I thought it would, and the output looks like the  program is going ahead and attempting to print the names of child nodes that dont exist. At the end, it throws a codeNullPointerExceptioncode, because it tries to reference the child of a node that doesnt exist.

Negative 603 pThis is a complete reedit and reasking of the question.  p  pIm having serious trouble understanding functional reactive programming.p  pIm looking for a nonacademic answer in the form of pseudo code andor just plain english andor powerpoint, etc., for someone who understands functional programming in general but not Haskell in particular, and Im not looking for a particular implementation.p  pFor example, I keep reading about lifting and functors in Haskell, but Im not sure if this is critical to FRP, but perhaps an enabling or simplifying thing for Haskell.p  pI read about events and behaviors as two different types of signals.  I think this is critical, but is it sufficientp  pie, what are the basic, orthogonal concepts I need to understand how FRP makes a truly stateful thing like GUIs appear nonstateful to the FP programmerp  pHow does an underlying platforms callbacks and observer pattern get morphed into these functions Does the implementation language have to support functions as firstclass objects, ie would an imperative language like C have to have a halfbaked implementation of lisp etc to make frp workp  pI get that FRP is like a spreasheet, or like a directed graph, etc. but Im wondering what is the magic that makes statefulness appear to disappear.p

Negative 603 pIm trying to make a function InvertCopy that acts like memcpy, except that it also invert each bit while doing the copy.

For that an integerpointer would be excellent, except my InvertCopy should handle both int pointers and nonint pointers, therefore I cannot simply convert the pointer to int  on some processors it may actually cause hardware faults.p  pTo make it easier I decided to allow slower performance when handling unaligned buffers, and only make this optimization when possible.

Negative 603 pOver the last year Ive learned a lot about WCF, but since I dont use it every day I still know enough to be dangerous.  My example is too complicate to show something that will illustrate my full issue and Ill gladly show the pieces of what I do have that you would find helpful.  I have a duplex service and built a class called HostedTransactionServiceProcess that encapsulates the service calls so that any clientlevel class using this doesnt have to understand the intricacies of working with a WCF Service.  The service that it is encapsulating its calls to can also communicate back via callback events.  The problem tends to be the coordination between service operations and receiving callback events.  Whenever a callback event is called by the service, the classlevel propertyfield values for HostedTransactionServiceProcess is null.  I think this makes sense as creating the channelproxy from ServicetoClient is left to the Service and doesnt allow for as much of the control we have when creating a channelproxy communicating from ClienttoService.  So if it instantiates its callback proxy, then everything defaults and its as though those values were never modified. p  pFirst of all, is this correct Secondly, how do I work around itp  pI was able to work around a need to utilize an EventWaitHandle by creating a named one that can work interprocess, but I still need other propertiesfield data in the class to be seen between operation calls and callback event calls.p  pAgain, I can give more info as needed, just let me knowp  pEdit  I tried to simplify things into an unworkable class that should at least illustrate my issue.  Maybe this will helpp  precode [CallbackBehaviorUseSynchronizationContext  false, ConcurrencyMode  ConcurrencyMode.Multiple, IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults  true] public class HostedTransactionServiceProcess  ServiceProcessltIHostedTransactionService, HostedTransactionServiceInvoker, ConfigurationDuplexChannelFactoryltIHostedTransactionServicegtgt, IHostedTransactionServiceProcess, IHostedTransactionCallbackService      region Properties      private ICADSession cadSession      public ICADSession CADSession              get  return cadSession          set  cadSession  value             endregion     region Operations      public void CommitICADSession cadSession, IEnumerableltIDTOEntitygt dtoEntityCollection, IDTODocument dtoDocument, IDTOOperationLock operationLock               lock serviceInvokerLock                      Since the callback session will be instantiated by the WCF Service, any fieldsproperties in this class will be instantiated to null.             This is because the Service is instantiating its own instance, creating its own proxy, based on the applied callback interface contract             To work around this so that a call to the CAD System can wait until the CAD System responds back through the WCF Service, a named, interprocess             EventWaitHandle will be used             using EventWaitHandle waitHandle  ServiceWaitHandleHelper.StartNewfalse, EventResetMode.AutoReset, cadSession, Commit                              Set a local value... the issue is that this will end up null when the callback event is called                 This seems to be because this instance making the Commit call is different from the callback instance created to make the OnCommitted call                 this.CADSession  cadSession                  Make the proxy operation call                 this.ServiceInvoker.ExecuteserviceProxy gt serviceProxy.CommitcadSession, dtoEntityCollection, dtoDocument, operationLock                  The lock will not be released for the next Commit operation call until the entire commit process is completed or the operation times out.                 waitHandle.WaitOneTimeSpan.FromMillisecondsMAXOPERATIONTIMEOUT                                  The WCF Service Callback will call this     public void OnCommittedICADSession cadSession, IEnumerableltIDTOEntitygt entityCollection, IDTODocument dtoDocument, IDTOOperationLock operationLock              First allow the Commit operation to continue         EventWaitHandle waitHandle  ServiceWaitHandleHelper.GetExistingcadSession, Commit         if waitHandle  null ampamp this.CADSession  cadSession   Here is the issue  Even though this.CADSession was set to a value, the callback instance says it is null             waitHandle.Set         else             return           endregion  codepre

Negative 603 pToday, I managed somehow to checkout all branch, giving me more than 30k files in checkin. While undoing those pending changes TFS becomes unresponsive. I tried to undo those pending changes project by project but doing so it took me 20 minutes to undo just 1k of files.p  pWhat I tried I removed the directory with all files. In tfs I converted the mapped folder to normal folder but all the files still appears in TFS in pending changes even though they are removed.p  pIs there any way to solve my problem Probably the best solution would be to remove this dir from TFS, and create thid dir once again and get latest, but is it possiblep

Negative 603 pi currently try to make an Website mobile friendly.

Negative 603 pOkay... hey guys, I hope you can help me solve this one, or maybe someone will be able to provide a comprehensible reasoning for the following.p  pThe newer versions of the Opera and Firefox browser are forcing a reduced available width onto websites. I assume thats in order to fit their content better with less unused space.p  pHowever, if a websites content exceeds the width of 1536 px and your screen resolution is 1920 px in width, the available width is still capped at 1536 a horizontal scrollbar appears.p  pIve prepared a demo as well a hrefhttpr00t.litestoperafittowidthfckup.html relnofollowhttpr00t.litestoperafittowidthfckup.htmlap  pSo I think its a nice feature of those browsers to fit website content to the available width as it often improves the readability, but what on earth can I do if I wantneed to utilize the full screen widthp  pIve toyed around with different meta tag viewport settings, but it hadnt have any effect. I guess thats for mobile devices only.p

Then, when you send a file when you do have an internet connection, it would take all the files that were saved locally and send them all at once.

Negative 603 pI am currently writing unit tests and I am having the following problemp  pI am supposed to write tests for the Service Layer.

So this is how the application interacts with the db. As for the unit testing part I have decided to go with codeMOQcode and I am pleased with its capabilities. I was able to fake the codeDbContextcode but now I am wondering how to inject it in the hierarchy of the program so that I can test the logic from the services with it. A more specific question would be which class from the above stated codeServiceBasecode,codeDataContextcode,codeDataContextBasecode, has to mocked so that when I call the codeGetContextcode method I end up with a fake codeDbContextcode As for the architecture of the logic for interaction with the db, I am open for any recommendations.

For example if the member variable wraps functionality of a network device for which the user has to specify the address. After the user entered the address I would create the codeDeviceWrappercode instance. My class would look something like thisp  precodeclass A  public   Method to instantiate dev and other stuff private   DeviceWrapper dev  codepre  pWhen declaring the member variable it is my understanding that the default constructor of codeDeviceWrappercode gets called if I dont explicitly call it in the constructor of codeAcode. However for the codeDeviceWrappercode class it doesnt make sense to have a default constructor as the class is pointless without knowing the address of the device to wrap. p  pAm I missing something here or does C force me to either define a pointless default constructor in codeDeviceWrappercode or make the class mutable so that the wrapper can receive its address after its creationp  pAnother alternative would be to make codedevcode a pointer to codeDeviceWrappercode. My idea of using pointers to objects is that the object that emownsem the instance has the instance directly and every other object that uses it but doesnt emownem it gets a pointer to the instance. This concept would be broken if I define codedevcode as codeDeviceWrapper devcodep  pSo what would be the C solution to solve this problemp

Negative 603 pIn many project which I take care of it there is nothing like lazy paging in datatables. p  pDoes JSF have some kind of magic or am I right that its really big performance problem.

If I ll use ORM JPA when I want to display DataTable with this list from backing bean.

Negative 603 pSuppose I have a hyperlink residing in cell B4 that will send the user to cell X30. The typical VBA hyperlinkclicking event only gives you access to the hyperlinks target cell X30. But I want to obtain the emlocationem cell B4 of the hyperlink, so that the code I run can be dependent on emwhereem the hyperlink physically is. Is there a way to do thisp  pOne option Ive already tried is using the ActiveCell object. Problem is, for each hyperlink I would need to specify its own location emasem the target, because ActiveCell only operates emafterem the hyperlink is followed, meaning it refers to the target, not the location. Actually doing this emcouldem work, since I only use the hyperlink as a macroinitiating button not as a link, but since I have so many of them and will be copypasting them, I would need a way of autospecifying target  self or something rather than target  B4.p

Negative 603 pI have a website built with Wordpress that has been having permalink issues. A few days ago, I had added a simple file, named qr.php, that I dropped in at the root level where the wpcontent and wpupload folders reside. It has a script that redirect to pages outside of my website depending on what type of device the user is using. Basically, some one on a Apple device gets redirected to an itunes page, and droid user to the droid app store, etc. p  pCould this non Wordpress page be causing issues I have had static or html pages in amonst my root level files before, and never had an issue. I feel like the redirects may change this. p

Negative 603 pI have a 3D matrix that I am applying a displacement field to, using imwarp.

Therefore, although you can read the name and value of a cookie, you cannot read the cookies expiration date and time. When the browser sends cookie information to the server, the browser does not include the expiration information.emp  pAs per this Microsofts comment, this means that browser will not send cookie expiration time, and that is the reason why Yii is seting expire property of received cookie to 0.p  pCan someone confirm this asumption, and is this true for httpOnly propertyp

Negative 603 pI am trying to allocate a certain amount of memory within some memory range in a DLL that gets loaded within a Windows Application. p  pThe way I am doing it, is using codeVirtualQuerycode to search for a region of memory that is marked as free and is within the boundaries where I require to do the allocation. What I am seeing is that even though the region is marked as codeMEMFREEcode codeVirtualAlloccode fails sometimes to allocate the memory.p  pThe code is very close to the followingp  precodeLPVOID address  NULL, mem  NULL  for address  LOWERRANGE address lt UPPERRANGE      MEMORYBASICINFORMATION mbi  0      if VirtualQueryaddress, ampmbi, sizeofmbi          if mbi.State  MEMFREE ampamp mbi.RegionSize gt ALLOCSIZE              mem  VirtualAllocaddress, ALLOCSIZE,                  MEMRESERVEMEMCOMMIT, PAGEEXECUTEREAD             if mem                  break                                 address  mbi.BaseAddress  mbi.RegionSize  codepre  pWhen codeVirtualAlloccode fails, codeGetLastErrorcode returns codeERRORINVALIDADDRESScode code487.codep  pThe way I have worked around it is, if it is big enough, scan through codembi.RegionSizecode using page size steps to find an address that will allow me to allocate the memory that I need.p  pWhy is it that according to codeVirtualQuerycode the entire region should be free and I should be able to allocate inside any address I want, but usually when the first codeVirtualAlloccode fails I have to loop for several steps until it is finally successful. p

Negative 603 pHello SO folks and more specifically Google folks monitoring this tag per your support page.   I am working from .NET and strongPlaylistItems.Liststrongsnippet,contentDetails does not do a whole lot compared to the old RSS Feed search.  In fact adding part strongcontentDetailsstrong adds little value in that only the VideoID is now returned but it is already part of Snippet.ResourceId.VideoIdp  blockquote   pkind youtubeplaylistItem,      bla,      bla,      contentDetails        videoId DLME0PsJRnk      p blockquote  pWhy add a part which is only going to return one bit of informationp  pHow about supporting something like snippet,contentDetailsstrongduration,PublishedAt,Viewsstrong I feel this is kind of basic metadata snippet most apps would want to list to the users.  While you are at it please please remove this nonsense of Java casing of parameters.  Why would you leakout your language of choice into an API, thats really sad. Yes it is frustrating to keep checking whether I casespelled them correctly.p  pWell, it looks like you are forcing us to build a list of VideoIds than turn around and make more API calls when I was doing it previously with fewer. It also means, I will have to manage the 50 items max paging twice, once for the playlist if it is over 50 videos and then manage manually my list of VideosIds paging when I turn around to make Videos.List calls.p  pLet me know if I missed an AllInOne call type of API,  thank you.p

Im trying to avoid postbacks, so I dont have a server validation function. I dont think it matters, because if the validator fails then it wont allow any submit button to work.p  pThe problem is that it doesnt work. Even when the validation was only returning true or false it didnt appear to change anything.  Ive been using Chromes inspect element to track the Javascript execution, and Ive found something interesting.p  pTo test it, I try selecting the choices that should return false. I see it go through the validation function, and the logic works out fine. When ValidatorUpdateDisplay is called, it indeed shows the custom validators error message. p  pBut then I see the execution is in ValidatorValidate. It then calls this function p  precodeval.isvalid  val.evaluationfunctionval codepre  pAnd this resets val.isvalid to true, even though I set it to false previously.p  pIt then calls ValidatorUpdateDisplay and the validator becomes invisible once more.p  pI dont know why ValidatorValidate is being called, but since it is, why isnt it going to the custom validation function I cant see where its finding true.p  pstrongEDITstrong I relented and added in a serverside method. It looks at the same drop down lists and performs the same logic as before. But now its being correctly displayed as invalid. Of course, this occurs after a postback, which I dont really want.p  pHow can I get this to validate correctly on the client side Every time the validation is performed, it goes correctly once, and then gets called again for some reason, and always returns true.  It disappears dynamically just fine, again leading me to believe that this always returns true.p

I  have reproduced the error in program above. The problem is that codeBeebcode becomes unresponsive after a while, even if you leave it alone for a few seconds to complete its previous tasks. So it uses something up and doesnt return it. If you change 1000 to 20 nothing changes. p

E.g. in the above codelistcode the ditsinct procedure should return codeListSetOneTwoa, b, SetOneTwoe, fcode, because codeSetOneTwoa, bcode is contained within codeSetOneTwoa, b, OneTwoc, fcode and codeSetOneTwoa, bcode is smaller in size.p  pNow, the following works in the REPL and compiles, see the but laterp  precodedef ord Ordering[Set[OneTwo]]  new Ordering[Set[OneTwo]]    def compareset1 Set[OneTwo], set2 Set[OneTwo] Int       if set1.equalsset2  set1.subsetOfset2  set2.subsetOfset1 0 else if set1.size  set2.size set1.size compare set2.size else       set1.hashCode compare set2.hashCode      val listSorted  list.sortedord.reverse  val listDistinct   collection.immutable.SortedSetlistSorted ord.toList  listDistinct codepre  pGivesp  precodeList[scala.collection.immutable.Set[OneTwo]]  ListSetOneTwoe,f, SetOneTwoa,b codepre  pBUT This ordering violates the Transitivity requiremnt of an ordering, therefore at run time this would throw a codejava.lang.IllegalArgumentException Comparison method violates its general contractcode Exception.p  pVery simple to see whyp  precodescalagt ord.compareSetOneTwoa,b, SetOneTwoe, f res56 Int  1  scalagt ord.compareSetOneTwoe,f, SetOneTwoa, b, OneTwoc, d res57 Int  1  scalagt ord.compareSetOneTwoa,b, SetOneTwoa, b, OneTwoc, d res58 Int  0 codepre  pWhich means A lt B, B lt C yet A  C. A problem.p  pBottomline is there any way I could do what I want to do to my list of sets of OneTwo case class I dont care by the way about the final order of this list, it could also result in a Set, and it doesnt have to be similar to my strategyp

Negative 603 pcodempmeventcode is like codempmworkercode except that codempmeventcode manages all nonSSL KeepAlive connections with a separate, dedicated thread rather than having each thread manage each individual connection.  By giving and then keeping a dedicated thread for each KeepAlive connection, codempmworkercode leaves that thread and its resources bound to that connection regardless of whether or not a request is being processed. codempmeventcode on the other hand, can lower system resource use in high concurrency environments by allowing the thread and its resources to be recycled back to the system once requests are complete.p  pIt seems to me that in high concurrency, nonSSL environments where KeepAlive has long timeouts, codempmeventcode has the potential to make for a system that can handle a higher workload with equivalent resources than a system with the same resorces using codempmworkercode. strongemMore importantly, it seems to me that in terms of resource use and features, codempmeventcode is at least as good as codempmworkercode, if not better, in all circumstances.emstrongp  pDespite my understanding that codempmeventcode is always at least as good and possibly better, my favorite Linux distributions default to using codempmworkercode when installing Apache 2.4 from the repositories. This makes me wonder if my thinking is incomplete and if there is some technical reason I am missing to use codempmworkercode rather than codempmeventcode in Apache 2.4.p  pstrongMy question therefore is am I correct in saying codempmworkercode is at least as good as codempmeventcode, if not better, in all circumstances, and 2 if not, what technical benefits are there to using codempmworkercode in Apache 2.4strongp
