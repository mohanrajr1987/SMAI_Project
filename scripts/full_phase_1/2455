Positive 2455 pA couple of years ago I began learning to code, and naturally began with apps for the devices I use, particularly macs. So most of what Ive learned is confined to the Xcode IDE, Objective C and Swift, and the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks.  Its been a cozy environment. p  pBut Im ready to spread my wings a bit, and would like to begin learning to prepare apps, particularly for Windows users. p  pKeeping in mind that I still use a Mac though I have access to Windows computers I can test on, what would be a good path for broadening my capabilities in this way Is there a preferred IDE What languages should I begin learning Are there key frameworks that are parallel to Cocoap
Positive 2455 pThis is my very first topic in here and I wish to ask my question as good as I can.p  pI have always been interested in programming languages styles, capabilities, functionalities and so on and I have recently started to design my own one. It is very basic and only characterbased it doesnt recognize keywords or anything. I first implemented the interpreter in Python language facilities and algorithm design and then ported it to C which I really like  Here is the famous codehello, worldcode program written in a hrefhttpsgithub.comSpriithyBitflow relnofollowBitflowap  precode 0     amp,     ,     ,,     ,          amp,     ,     ,     ,     ,     amp, codepre  pSo now. Back to my question  I would really like to implement a little bit more improved language that could handle very basic functionalities. I dont want to go big now obviously not the good thing to do in my opinion. Do you guys have good suggestions for me  What book should I read  except for the Dragon Book, which definitely contains more theory than anything else What could be a good idea to start with  Do you know anything that leads to some project that looks cool p  pMoreover, Ive read the KampR book codeThe UNIX programming environmentcode and codeThe C programming languagecode. The first provide a simple programming language that Id like to redesign by hand. source code provided no longer compiles due to standards evolution, even with me rewriting most of things in ANSI C or C99.p  pThank you guys in advance  Feel free to link articles or tutorials, similar questions p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comSpriithyBitflow relnofollowlink to bitflow repositoryap  pPS Excuse my bare english...

Positive 2455 pAFAIK, the use of sharedptr is often discouraged because of potential bugs caused by careless usage of them unless you have a really good explanation for significant benefit and carefully checked design.p  pOn the other hand, Python objects seem to be essentially sharedptrs refcount and garbage collection.p  pI am wondering what makes them work nicely in Python but potentially dangerous in C. In other words, what are the differences between Python and C in dealing with sharedptr that makes their usage discouraged in C but not causing similar problems in Pythonp  pI know e.g. Python automatically detects cycles between objects which prevents memory leaks that dangling cyclic sharedptrs can cause in C.p

Positive 2455 pCurrently I am taking a course on concepts of programming languages, which is where I came across an issue that had left me confused once before when I was watching the videos of a hrefhttpswww.coursera.orgcourseprogfun relnofollowMartin Oderskys functional programming course on Courseraap  pThe term callbyvalue is constantly being used in two different contextsp  pstrongContext 1 Evaluation regime Callbyvalue vs. callbynamestrongp  pIf a function is being passed an expression as an argument, is that expression being reduced to a value i.e., evaluated before the parameter identifiers in the functions body are substituted with it If so, its called callbyvalue, if not, its callbyname. At least thats how I understand it.p  pstrongContext 2 Parameter passing Callbyvalue vs. callbyreferencestrongp  pIf a function is being passed an identifier as an argument, is the functions body being evaluated with a new name binding that points to a copy of what the given identifier points at, or can the function actually make changes to what the identifier points at, i.e., changes that are visible to the calling context Again, the first variant would be callbyvalue, whereas the second one would be callbyreference. emIfem I got it right, of course.p  pHowever, even though I fail to see a relation between the two use cases of the term callbyvalue, it seems too much of a coincidence for the term to be used in both scenarios by accident.p  pDoes someone know why the same term was chosen to describle two seemingly different mattersp

Positive 2455 pIt seems to be a commonplace that accesses to lexical scope can be worked out at compile time or by a static analyzer, since my example is in Python based simply on location in the source code.p  pHere is a very simple example where one function has two closures with different values for codeacode.p  precodedef elvisa   def fs     return a   for the   s   return f  f1  elvisone f2  elvistwo print f1money, f2show codepre  pI have no problem with the idea that when we are reading the code for the function codefcode, when we see codeacode, it is not defined in codefcode, so we pop up to the enclosing function and find one there, and that is what the codeacode in codefcode refers to.  Location in the source code is enough to tell me that codefcode gets a value for codeacode from an enclosing scope.p  pBut as described a hrefhttpwww.composingprograms.compages16higherorderfunctions.htmldefiningfunctionsiiinesteddefinitions relnofollowherea, when a function is called, its local frame extends its parent environment.  So doing environment lookups at runtime is no problem.  But what I am unsure of is that a static analyzer could always work out emwhichem closure is referred to at compile time, before the code is ever run.  In the example above it is obvious that codeelviscode has two closures and it is easy to keep track of them, but other cases will not be so simple.  Intuitively I am nervous that an attempt at static analysis could run into a halting problem in general.p  pSo does lexical scoping really have a dynamic aspect to it, where location in the source code tells us that an enclosing scope is involved but not necessarily which closure is referred to  Or is this a solved problem in compilers, and all references within functions to their closures really can be worked out in detail staticallyp  pOr does the answer depend on the programming language  in which case lexical scoping is not as strong a concept as I thought it wasp  p[EDIT commentsp  pIn terms of my example I can restate my question I read claims like Lexical resolution can be determined at compile time, yet wondered how references to the value of codeacode in codef1code and codef2code could be worked out staticallyat compile time in general.p  pThe solution is, lexical scoping does not claim so much.  L.S. can tell us, at compile time, that emsomethingem called codeacode will be defined whenever I am in codefcode and this clearly can be worked out statically this is the definition of lexical scope, but determining what emvalueem it actually takes or, which closure is active is 1 beyond the L.S. concept, 2 done at runtime not statically so is dynamic in a sense, yet of course 3 uses a rule different from dynamic scoping.p  pThe takeaway message, to quote PatrickMaupin, is Some dynamic work still has to be done. ]p

Negative 2455 pI have a database that I would like to leverage with codeZendSearchLucenecode. However, I am having difficulty creating a fully searchable document for Lucene.p  pEach codeZendSearchLucenecode document pulls information from two relational database tables codeTableOnecode and codeTableTwocode. codeTableOnecode has basic information codeidcode, codeowneridcode, codetitlecode, codedescriptioncode, codelocationcode, etc., codeTableTwocode has a 1N relationship to codeTableOnecode meaning, for each entry in codeTableOnecode, there could be one or more entries in codeTableTwocode. TableTwo contains id, codelistingidcode, codebedroomscode, codebathroomscode, codepricemincode, codepricemaxcode, codedateavailablecode. See Figure 1. p  pFigure 1p  precodeTableOne     id Primary Key     ownerid     title     description     location     etc...

This way I can get rid of all the unnecessary queries in the for loop. However Im still facing the problem to very fastly calculate all dates that doesnt have any equivalent in database. One way to simply move the problem could be to let MySQL do the job and simply use one big query calculate all the datesuse MySQL date functions with a left join the data. Would it be wise to let MySQL take the extra load Anyway Im reluctant to use all these mktimedate in the for loop.

Negative 2455 pI have recently encountered some inconsistencies in running unit tests inside VS2008 vs running the same unit tests with mstest on the command line.p  pMy scenario is a bit advanced, so I have probably hit some corners. I have many data driven unit tests running against the same DataSource. I also like experimenting with PostSharp. So, I have written a PostSharp aspect  codeTestDataSourcecode  which I apply to a unit test type, not the unit test methods. When the type is built, this aspect instructs PostSharp to attach the codeDataSourcecode attribute to each and every unit test method in the type.p  pExamining the built assembly in Reflector shows that each test method is indeed attributed with the correct codeDataSourcecode attribute. Running the tests with mstest on the command line behaves as expected  each test is run against the specified data source.p  pHowever, running exactly the same unit tests in VS2008 fails to find the data source. It is as though VS2008 ignores the built assembly and looks at the source code, which, of course, does not appear to be a data driven test, because the codeDataSourcecode attribute is injected during the build.p  pThere is no problem with deployed items. Attaching the codeDataSourcecode manually to the tests makes VS2008 run them happily.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 2455 pI am planning to create a screen saver. Thinking of trying out some WPF as well. Anyways, I am not quite sure how I would organize the screen saver on disk in the file system. I have mainly two related issues that I am very uncertain on how to solvep  ol lipNormally an application lives, with all its 3rd party assemblies, static resources, images, etc., in the Program Files folder and is run from there. For example emCProgram FilesMyScreenSaverem. But if I havent missed something the executable of a screen saver in windows need to have the scr extension and to live in the system folder, for example emCWindowsSystem32em. How do you program the screen saver so that it can find the rest of itself Would you use the windows registry Or creat some sort of config file next to the scr file with the path to the rest And would you make the scr to just be sort of a launcher of an exe in the application folder Or would this be a bad ideapli lipI also want the screen saver to download new content from certain places on the internet. But where do I put it, and how does the screen saver find it If I have understood correctly, an application is not to create new contents in its application folder, but rather in a user folder. How do I find that folder Do you build it up from environment variables And in what specific directory should things like this really be in For example on Vista I see that you have one folder called emCProgramDataem. You also have emCUsersusernameAppDataLocalem, emCUsersusernameAppDataLocalLowem and emCUsersusernameAppDataRoamingem. Have also seen a lot of programs dump stuff in the my documents folder although I hate programs cluttering up my documents folder, so I will probably try to avoid that p.pli ol  pWhat are some best practices when it comes to these issues of laying out your application in the file system I am want it to be best and most correct for Windows 7, which means it will probably work the same in Vista as well , but it would also need to work in XP, since ema lotem of people are using that still.p

The biggest problem was that if you used the mouse to scroll the DataGrid, it would get stuck in a loop as it process the scrollbars ValueChanged event after the data was added. Thats why I added ScrollbarOff and ScrollbarOn  I call them before and after getting new records, which disables the scrollbar temporarily.p  pThe problem with strongthatstrong is that after the scrollbar is reenabled, it doesnt keep track of the current mouse state, so if you hold down the Down button with the mouse or click on part of the scrollbar it stops scrolling after it has added the new records, and you have to click it again.p  pAlso, it doesnt seem a particularly elegant way of doing things.p  pHas anyone ever done this before, and how did you achieve itp  pCheers.p
Negative 2455 pIm trying to create some nice RESTful structure for my app in rails but now Im stuck on a conception that unfortunately Im not sure if its correct, but if someone could help me on this it would be very well appreciated.p  pIf noticed that for RESTful routes we have the uncommented onesp  precodecollection     index   gt GET     create  gt POST           gt PUT           gt DELETE  member      show    gt GET           gt POST     update  gt PUT     destroy gt DELETE codepre  pin this case Im only talking about base level action or the ones that occur directly inside i.e b a hrefhttpdomain.comscreenametips relnofollowhttpdomain.comscreenametipsab or bhttpdomain.comscreenametips16bp  pbut at the same time I notice that theres no POST possibility for the members, anybody knows whyp  pWhat if Im trying to create a self contained item that clones itself with another onwerp  pIm almost sure that this would be nicely generated by a POST method inside the member action, but unfortunately it looks like that theres no default methods on the map.resources on rails for this.p  pI tried something using member, or new but it doesnt work like thisp  precode map.resources tips, pathprefix gt user, member  gt add gt post codepre  pso this would be accessed inside bhttpdomain.comscreenametips16addb and not bhttpdomain.comscreenametips16b.p  pSo how would it be possible to create a default POST method for the member in a RESTful route p  pI was thinking that maybe this isnt in there because its not part of REST declaration, but as a quick search over it I foundp  pbPOSTbp  pbfor collections b Create a new entry in the collection where the ID is assigned automatically by the collection. The ID created is usually included as part of the data returned by this operation.p  pbfor members b Treats the addressed member as a collection in its own right and creates a new subordinate of it.p  pSo this concept still the same if you think about the bDELETEb method or bPUTb for the collection. What if I want to delete all the collection instead just one member or even replace thembPUTbp  pSo how could I create this specific methods that seems to be missing on map.resourcesp  pThats it, I hope its easy to understand.p  pCheersp

Negative 2455 pI have been playing Bejeweled Blitz for a while now.   Yes, it is an addiction.   In thinking about the game, I have observed that on some boards, the bottom runs dry no moves leaving only the top part of the board playable.  Frequently that part of the board drys up, and one is left with moves in area cleared by the last move.p  pThe board never runs completely dry, so clearly the program is doing some sorts of calculation that allows it to choose what to drop to prevent it from running dry.p  pI have noticed in this mode that it is very common for the algorithm to drop jewels which causes more nondry area to appear in the horizontal area.  Perhaps less frequent is a drop which seems designed to open up the bottom part of the board again.p  pSo my question is strongHow would one go about designing an algorithm guarantee that there is always a move available.strongp

I am currently doing it like thisp  precodedb.executeREPLACE INTO   table     ,.joincols   VALUES      ,.join[  ,.join[s]  lencols  ]  lendata,     [row[col] for row in data for col in cols] codepre  pIt works fine, but it is kind of awkward. I was wondering if I could make it easier to read, and I found out about the executemany command. I changed my code to look like thisp  precodedb.executemanyREPLACE INTO   table     ,.joincols          VALUES  ,.join[s]  lencols  ,     [tuplerow[col] for col in cols for row in data] codepre  pIt still worked, but it ran a lot slower. In my tests, for relatively small data sets about 100200 rows, it ran about 6 times slower. For big data sets about 13,000 rows, the biggest I am expecting to handle, it ran about 50 times slower. Why is it doing thisp  pI would really like to simplify my code, but I dont want the big drop in performance. Does anyone know of any way to make it fasterp  pI am using Python 2.7 and MySQLdb 1.2.3. I tried tinkering with the setinputsizes function, but that didnt seem to do anything. I looked at the MySQLdb source code and it looks like it shouldnt do anything.p

Negative 2455 pIve been using IoC containers for quite some time but today Ive found some pattern appearing in code over and over again. To give you some background I am now working on web application basically used for data analysis. There is a set of features there, that requires user to pick up what we call codeQueryTypeContexcode at the very beginning. Once this query type is chosen other steps may be taken but that all are performed in this specific codeQueryTypeContexcode. In the gui the codeQueryTypeContexcode pick up is represented as opening new tab with other controls.p  pWhen user is working with given codeQueryTypeContexcode all ajax calls to the server include codeQueryTypeIdcode that identifies users choice and is used to build codeQueryTypeContexcode on the server which then is used for various data retrieval and manipulation. p  pWhat Ive found is that many of our controllers we use asp.net mvc that are constructed with Ioc container have one thing in common. There is an action method that looks somewhat like thisp  precodepublic class AttributeController  Controller     public AttributeControllerIUsefulService usefulService         usefulservice  usefulService      ActionResult GetAttributesQueryTypeContex context        var dataDto  usefulService.Manipulatecontext, currentUser     return JSondataDto      ...  codepre  pIn order to bind codeQueryTypeContexcode to action argument we use custom model binder that pulls some information from database. Once the service gets codeQueryTypeContexcode as argument it passes it or its properties down to its collaborators in method arguments for instance data access layer. And so there is a factory class that looks like thisp  precodepublic interface IDateValueFactory      DateValue CurrentYearQueryTypeContex context    DateValue RollingMonthint numberOfMonths, QueryTypeContex context    DateValue RollingQuareterint numberOfQuarters, QueryTypeContex context   public class DateValueFactory  IDateValueFactory     public DateValueFactoryIDateValueDb dateValueDb        dateValueDb  dateValueDb       public DateValue CurrentYearQueryTypeContext context        var currentYear  dateValueDb.GetCurrentYearcontext.Id     return new DateValueDateValueType.CurrentYear, currentYear, context       public DateValue RollingMonthint numberOfMonths, QueryTypeContex context        return new DateValueDateValueType.RollingMonth, numberOfMonths, context      ...   codepre  pAs you see all of these methods get codeQueryTypeContexcode as a parameter more importantly strongthey all get the very same instance of  codeQueryTypeContexcode during their short lifestrong one web request. So I started to wonder if I could refactor this so that whenever many service class methods require codeQueryTypeContexcode as arguments it would be injected via constructor instead of passing the same value over an over again. For examplep  precodepublic interface IDateValueFactory      DateValue CurrentYear    DateValue RollingMonthint numberOfMonths    DateValue RollingQuareterint numberOfQuarters   public class DateValueFactory  IDateValueFactory     public DateValueFactoryIDateValueDb dateValueDb, QueryTypeContext context        dateValueDb  dateValueDb     context  context       public DateValue CurrentYear        var currentYear  dateValueDb.GetCurrentYearcontext.Id     return new DateValueDateValueType.CurrentYear, currentYear, context       public DateValue RollingMonthint numberOfMonths        return new DateValueDateValueType.RollingMonth, numberOfMonths, context      ...   codepre  pAnd now the real question strongIs this a good idea to to this sort of thing or it violates some design principles i should adhere to strongp  pIn order to inject codeQueryTypeContexcode instance, builded using information from http request I thought about embedding the QueryTypeId in the uris so it would be available in the RouteData on the server. Then before the controller is constructed I could pull it out, build the codeQueryTypeContexcode, create nested IoC container for that request and inject it into the container. Then whenever some class would need codeQueryTypeContexcode to perform its job it would simply declare it as constructor argument.p

Negative 2455 pAlright so first im coding in C using the win32 api, no mfc, no .net, no wxwidgets. Ive created a window with the WCTABCONTROL class, and have added tabs to it, everything works fine except... I need to have content in each tab, I got the impression from msdn that I needed to create a dialog for each page, and then load the dialog when the user selects a tab. Only problem with this is my main window isnt a dialog, so making the dialog box for the tab fit perfectly is not working too good.p  pSo Im wondering if theres a better way to do this I thought about just hiding and showing different controls per tab but that doesnt seem like a good idea.p  pWhat Id like is when my application starts it will resize the window and the tab control to the minimal size needed to fit all the tabs 34 tabs, and the window isnt going to be resizable which I guess simplifies things a little bit. I did this by following the example on msdn Loading each dialog box into memory, looping thru each one and setting a RECT to the minimal size needed then resizing everything, problem is that the size is in dialog box units and I cant convert it to pixels because I dont have a HWND to the dialog box yet.p  pemBasicallyem my question is what is the best way to manage controls on a window with a tab control. So if I have a tab control and the user changes from tab1 to tab2, I want different controls to be displayed to the user.p

Negative 2455 pThe question might be slightly hard to understand, so Ill explain it more verboselyp  pSay I have a mobile site on a website and the root of the site is a hrefhttpwww.site.commobile relnofollowhttpwww.site.commobileap  pIf I load up this page without any hashes in the URL, then I get one div with datarolepage in the DOM. If I then click a link to another page, which might take me to the URL a hrefhttpwww.site.commobilemobilecontact.html relnofollowhttpwww.site.commobilemobilecontact.htmla, I get another datarolepage link for that page is inserted into the div. Thats all fine and correct.p  pHowever, if I then follow a link on this page back to the home page but not the back button and get the URL a hrefhttpwww.site.commobilemobile relnofollowhttpwww.site.commobilemobilea, then rather than jQuery Mobile reusing the same datarolepage div that was there when the page was first loaded, a new one is inserted into the DOM.p  pThis has the effect that any JavaScript bound to the pagecreate event that targets specific ids within the home page doesnt work as the ids are ambiguous.p  pOne thing I noticed when inspecting the generated HTML is that a datarolepage div loaded directly not through a hash Ajax load has a dataurl attribute that is equal to the id of that div, but when it is loaded through a hash, then dataurl is equal to the hash value. I wonder if this inconsistency is causing the issuep

This is pretty simple, but I feel like I might be doing something wrong.p  pI know how to append an element to a list i.e. the record shelf in this example, but Im not sure how to properly maintain this list across invocations of this codeaddcode function.

This makes sense, but Im not sure if thats what I want.p  pSo if I wanted to add a bunch of records to the list like sop  precodeaddrecord highway61 recordshelf addrecord sgtPepper recordshelf codepre  pOf course it doesnt result in what I want, because coderecordshelfcode doesnt get updated. And I dont think at this point in the course were supposed to use codesetcode or assignments.p  pShould I just be grabbing a copy of the returned list from codeaddrecordcode every time, and then use that returned list in the next invocationp

We find the  strongv1strong  strongkstrong  strongsstrongstrongnstrong  strongdeltastrongth and emv2em  emkem  strongsstrongstrongnstrong  strongdeltastrong   th smallest elements in strongSstrong.  Almost certainly, the kth smallest   element in strongSstrong will fall between strongv1strong and strongv2strong, so we are left with a   selection problem on strong2strong  strongdeltastrong elements. With low  probability, the   kth smallest element does not fall in this range, and we have   considerable work to do. However, with a good choice of strongsstrong and strongdeltastrong,   we can ensure, by the laws of probability, that the second case does   not adversely affect the total work.p blockquote  pI do not follow the above text. Can anyone please explain to me with examples. How did the author reduce to strong2strong  strongdeltastrong elements And how does he know that there is a low probablity that element does not fall into this category.p  pThanksp

Negative 2455 pI have a little site thats available in different languages which are selected based on the following criteria increasing order of preferencep  ol licodeAcceptLanguagecode sent by the browserli liA cookie specifying the preferred languageli liThe request path containing a language preference at the endli ol  pThe site itself consists of only static HTML pages and insofar possible Id like to keep it that way. I implemented the language selection via codemodnegotiationcode, codemodrewritecode and the following code.htaccesscode file shortened to omit declaration of languages and charsetsp  precodeOptions FollowSymLinks MultiViews DirectoryIndex index  Header set Pragma nocache  RewriteEngine on RewriteRule [azAZ]2,5 index [COlanguage1.example.com525600,ELANG1]  SetEnvIf Cookie language[azAZ] COOKIELANG1  SetEnvIf COOKIELANG . preferlanguage1 SetEnvIf REDIRECTLANG . preferlanguage1   plenty of AddLanguage and AddCharset calls  LanguagePriority enus DefaultLanguage enus ForceLanguagePriority Prefer Fallback codepre  pwhich has been working fine since August or so to allow for the followingp  ol liNo cookie present, codeAcceptLanguagecode takes over thanks to codeMultiViewscodeli liCookie present, the cookies language will be used codepreferlanguagecodeli liThe request path is codeescode or similar and that will be used to a set a cookie and b set codepreferlanguagecode to that value.li ol  pNow, I have a few more resources on the site which, thanks to codeMultiViewscode, can be selected via coderesourcecode instead of coderesource.htmlcode and content negotiation and the cookie option still work fine for selecting the appropriate language here.p  pNow I wanted to expand URI processing so that things like coderesourceencode work in directly selecting the resource in a specific language, so that this doesnt only work for codecode. I tried the following codeRewriteRulecodep  precodeRewriteRule [][azAZ]2,5 2 [COlanguage3.example.com525600,ELANG3] codepre  pand it works insofar that the correct resource is sent and the correct cookie is set, but the preferred language apparently isnt taken from the environment variable anymore. The only thing now forcing the language selection is the cookie, but that is still the same as before on that request, so I wont see the new language until I refreshed the page. Nothing I tried so far with the rules had an effect on that behaviour. Interestingly, with this rule the old behaviour documented above still works fine. Its only if I request something different from codecode that it does strange things.p  pThis is on shared hosting within a FreeBSD jail so I cant enable the rewrite log as I dont even know the physical path where the files are besides, it quite clearly seems to ignore the environment variable and only using the cookie for setting the preferred language for some reason. And I havent figured out why so far. Any helpp

Negative 2455 pI currently have a socket application that I use to send string back and forth from a client to a server.  I recently decided that it would make more sense to send serialized objects  instead but ran into a problem.  I converted the code to use the SoapFormatter which allowed me to serialize the objects to string and send the string.  I ran into an issue on the client side when trying to deserialize inherited objects.  It seems that the soapformatter does not support inheritance.  The problem occured during deserialization, if i tried to deserialize the parent object when i send the child object I dont know if this is correct terminology it would throw a cast exception.p  pMy question is, does the BinaryFormatter support inheritance  p

What Im interested in is how its being done in the jQuery UI tabs demo specifically, because  as far as I can find  its not doing any of those things.p  pEdit, Feb 4, 2013 When I go to the jQuery UI tabs demo, I now see the dotted line around the element inside the tabs. I dont know whether it was a deficiency in the browser I was using when I saw the phenomenon seems likely, as not many other people seemed to see it, or what. In any case, I guess the question is moot.p  pI genuinely appreciate everyone who took the time to venture an answer. Thank youp

The controls name is ItemDetail.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjJ3zc.png altCustom control for listbox To fill the list, i click on each of the buttons above, which make a SQL query the query can sometimes take about 5 seconds, and makes it more than noticeable that the UI has frozen.p  pTo fix that, Im using a BackgroundWorker for the SQL query, and reporting the progress everytime a resulting row from the query is returned.p  precodeprivate void DepartamentoClickobject sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e              ElementosLista.Items.Clear         BackgroundWorker worker  new BackgroundWorker         worker.WorkerReportsProgress  true         worker.ProgressChanged  new ProgressChangedEventHandlerworkerProgressChanged          worker.DoWork  delegateobject s, DoWorkEventArgs args                     SQL query            reglas.Consultacerrado0 and grupo3 order by fecha desc                 foreach DataRow dr in reglas.Entidad.tabla.Rows                              worker.ReportProgress0, dr                                worker.RunWorkerAsync      codepre  pAnd Im using the BackgroundWorkers IsProgressChanged event to add the data to an instance of ItemDetail, and then adding it to the ListBox. p  precode void workerProgressChangedobject sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e              ItemDetail item  new ItemDetailDataRowe.UserState         ElementosLista.Items.Additem      codepre  pThis way, the operation takes a lot less time, but it still freezes, and its due to the UI refresh that has to be done after each row of the query is returned. The BackgroundWorker doesnt let me add the data to the ItemDetail control in a separate thread, because its no the UI thread.p  pIs there a way I can speed up the process of rendering a lot of controls at once or add them in smaller batches to the list, so the UI doesnt seem completely unresponsive until Its done filling the list.p  pThanks in advance, and sorry for the possibly tangled up question.p

Ant could not find the task or a class this task relies upon.  This is common and has a number of causes the usual solutions are to read the manual pages then download and install needed JAR files, or fix the build file   You have misspelt for.

The task is an Ant optional task and the JAR file andor libraries      implementing the functionality were not found at the time you      yourself built your installation of Ant from the Ant sources.    Fix Look in the ANTHOMElib for the ant JAR corresponding to the      task and make sure it contains more than merely a METAINFMANIFEST.MF.      If all it contains is the manifest, then rebuild Ant with the needed      libraries present in ant.homeliboptional , or alternatively,      download a prebuilt release version from apache.org   The build file was written for a later version of Ant    Fix upgrade to at least the latest release version of Ant   The task is not an Ant core or optional task      and needs to be declared using lttaskdefgt.   You are attempting to use a task defined using     ltpresetdefgt or ltmacrodefgt but have spelt wrong or not    defined it at the point of use  Remember that for JAR files to be visible to Ant tasks implemented in ANTHOMElib, the files must be in the same directory or on the classpath  Please neither file bug reports on this problem, nor email the Ant mailing lists, until all of these causes have been explored, as this is not an Ant bug. codepre

Negative 2455 pI want to serialize a list using SimpleXML, so that i can deserialize it again later. I need to preserve the order of elements, or at least achieve the same order everytime i serialize it, so that i can sort it, like, simply reserve the deserialized list.p  pThe order is important because its a list of GeoPoints that are used to draw a path on a map, and as a path that is actually travelled. Without preserving the order, the path will make no sense at all.p  pI do not need to use SimpleXML, but im already using it for deserializing other stuff, and everything except preserving the order already works, so i would like to avoid the overhead of learning to do this with another serializer. Also, SimpleXML works with Android 2.3.3, which is a must, as this is for an Android app.p  pI know about the parser and serializer that comes with Android, i actually use the parser, but i didnt do anything with the serializer yet, so it would be quite some overhead again, if there is an easy way of achieving what i need with SimpleXML.p  pPlease note that i am talking about preserving the strongorder of elements in a liststrong, not the elements of a class, for which there is a tag, and which seems to be a quite common problem compared to mine.p  pRegardsp

Negative 2455 pIm writing a program in C using Visual Studio 2012. The program requires two devices to be connected to it a pressure sensor and driver that controls a motorized platform. The program worked fine when I wrote all the driver code in main. The motors moved and the pressure sensor indicated the value. However, I wanted to simplify the program and apply objectsclasses to make it neater and more manageable. Im using a .lib and a .dll file, and for whatever reason, when I started to use objects, the program didnt like calling the functions from an object.p  pThis is the error I getp  precode Unhandled exception at 0x1000AAD2 Ldcnlib.dll in motors.exe 0xC0000005 Access violation writing location 0x00000025. codepre  pIm thinking maybe I have my codeincludescode wrong But I cant figure it out.

Negative 2455 pIm quite new to iOS development and I am stuck. Currently I am  using one tab controller to switch between two view controllers list and map view. This made it easier to use storyboard to configure the look of the two views.p  pNow the requirements have changed and the app needs to have one view controller with a segmented control that on click, displays either the list or the map view. In order to do this, I would need to make one view controller that can display listmap view.p  pI understand how the segmented controller part works, but Im just stuck on how I can go about having two views with one or the other displayed in the same area.  How can I go about having two views in one view controller if possible, utilizing storyboardp  pThanks in advance p

Negative 2455 pIm working on a codecademy exercise where were building a hangman game with jQueryJavaScript. The player starts with a string of underline characters strongemstrong and if they guess a letter in the word, the appropriate underline should be replaced with that letter. For example, if the word is tree and the player guesses e, the function should return emeep  pI wrote the function using gsub. N is the position where the string is supposed to be alterned, and c is the character to insert at that position on the original string. This passes the test at codecademy. p  precodefunction alterAt  n, c, originalString       var k  originalString.gsubn, c      return k    codepre  pHowever, codecademy told me to use the function substr and concatenation to return a new string with the letter replaced. I cant figure out how to do it this way, and Im not even sure if its the better way to do it. Whats wrong with using gsub Can you assist p

Negative 2455 pIm using a timeline in Rails, where if you put blockquote tags around the stuff you write in the media field, it will create a quote styling on the timeline. What Im trying to achieve is to have a checkbox, so that if it is checked, it will add the blockquote tags for you, so that users dont have to be expected to write html. p  pHow do I add the blockquote tags around whatever they write before it is submitted, but only if the checkbox is checked I was experimenting with trying to just get the jQuery to preappend the tags to the input field, so that they were visible to the user, but I cant get that working either. Preferrably, though, I would like it so that the user never sees the html in case they accidentally edit it, and so that their input is simply added to before it is sent to the database.p  pHere is what I have so farp  precodedocument.readyfunction     blockCheck.bindclick, function         var input  eventmedia input         if this.propchecked             input.prependltblockquotegt.appendltblockquotegt                codepre  pThe checkbox has an id of blockCheck and the input field has an id of eventmedia.

As you see, after 7 seconds the codefseekcodecodefwritecode rate reaches approx. 200 per second, still going down until it reaches 100 per second at the very end of the process. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlwrNx.png altfwrite per seconds vs timep  pIn the middle of the process 2 or 3 times, the OS decides to flush file contents to disk which I can see from my console output hanging a few seconds, during that time I have approx. 5 MBs write on my disk which isnt that much. After codefclosecode the system seems to write the whole file, I see 20 MBs disk activity for a longer period of time.p  pIf I use codefflushcode every 5.000 codefwritecodes, the behaviour doesnt change at all. Putting in codefclosecodecodefopencode to force flushing somehow speeds up the whole thing by approx. 10.p  pI did profile the process screenshot below and you see, that virtually all time is spent inside codefwritecode and codefseekcode which can be drilled down to codewritenocancelcode for both of them.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEV9vE.png altProfiling the write functionp  pstrongCompletely absurd summarystrongp  pImagine the case where my input data fits into my buffers completely and thus Im able to write my rotated output data linearly without the need to split the write process into fragments. I still use codefseekcode to position the file pointer, just because the logic of the writing function behaves that way, but the file pointer in this case is set to the same position where it already was. One would expect no performance impact. strongWrongstrong.p  pWhat is absurd is, if I remove the calls to codefseekcode for that special case, my function finishes within strong2.7 secondsstrong instead of 120 seconds.p  pNow, after a long foreword, the question is Why does codefseekcode have such an impact on performance, even if I seek to the same position How could I speed it up by another strategy or other function calls, disabling caching if possible, memory mapped access, ...p  pFor reference, heres my code not tidied up, not optimized, containing lots of debug outputp  precodeboolwriteRotatedRawTIFFtiff toFileNSStringstrFile      iftiff return NO     ifstrFile return NO      NSLogStarting to rotate ..., strFile      FILE f  fopen[strFile UTF8String], w     iff              NSString msg  [NSString stringWithFormatCould not open  for writing., strFile]         NSRunAlertPanelError, msg, OK, nil, nil         return NO       define LINECACHESIZE 10241024256      int h  [tiff iImageHeight]     int w  [tiff iImageWidth]     int iWordSize  [tiff iBitsPerSample]8     int iBitsPerPixel  [tiff iBitsPerSample]     int iLineSize  wiWordSize     int iLinesInCache  LINECACHESIZE  iLineSize     int iLinesToGo  h, iLinesToRead      NSLogCreating temporary file     double time  CACurrentMediaTime     double lastTime  time     unsigned char dummy  callociLineSize, 1     forint i0 ilth i fwritedummy, 1, iLineSize, f     freedummy     fclosef     f  fopen[strFile UTF8String], w     NSLogCreated temporary file .1f MB in .1f seconds, floatiLineSizefloath1024.0f1024.0f, CACurrentMediaTimetime     fseekf, 0, SEEKSET      lastTime  CACurrentMediaTime     time  CACurrentMediaTime     int y0     unsigned char ucRotatedPixels  mallociLinesInCacheiWordSize     unsigned short int uRotatedPixels  unsigned short intucRotatedPixels     unsigned char ucLineCache  mallocwiWordSizeiLinesInCache     unsigned short int uLineCache  unsigned short intucLineCache     unsigned char uc     unsigned int uSizeCounter0, uMaxSize  iLineSizeh, numfwrites0, lastwrites0     whileiLinesToGogt0              iLinesToRead  iLinesToGo         ifiLinesToReadgtiLinesInCache iLinesToRead  iLinesInCache          forint i0 iltiLinesToRead i                       read as much lines as fit into buffer             uc  [tiff getRawLineyi withBitsPerPixeliBitsPerPixel]             memcpyucLineCacheiiLineSize, uc, iLineSize                   forint x0 xltw x                      ifiBitsPerPixel8                              forint i0 iltiLinesToRead i                                      ucRotatedPixels[iLinesToReadi1]  ucLineCache[iwx]                                  fseekf, wxhy1, SEEKSET                 fwriteucRotatedPixels, 1, iLinesToRead, f                 numfwrites                 uSizeCounter  iLinesToRead                 ifCACurrentMediaTimelastTimegt1.0                                      lastTime  CACurrentMediaTime                     NSLogProgress .1f , xd, yd, iLinesToReaddtd, floatuSizeCounter  100.0f  floatuMaxSize, x, y, iLinesToRead, numfwrites                                           else                              forint i0 iltiLinesToRead i                                      uRotatedPixels[iLinesToReadi1]  uLineCache[iwx]                                  fseekf, wxhy12, SEEKSET                 fwriteuRotatedPixels, 2, iLinesToRead, f                 uSizeCounter  iLinesToRead2                 ifCACurrentMediaTimelastTimegt1.0                                      lastTime  CACurrentMediaTime                     NSLogProgress .1f , xd, yd, iLinesToReaddtd, floatuSizeCounter  100.0f  floatuMaxSize, x, y, iLinesToRead, numfwrites                                                y  iLinesInCache         iLinesToGo  iLinesToRead           freeucLineCache     freeucRotatedPixels     fclosef      NSLogFinished, .1f s, CACurrentMediaTimetime      return YES  codepre  pIm a bit lost because I do not understand how the system optimizes my calls.

Negative 2455 pI have a single authorize.net account, and I have 5 different ecommerce applications tied to that account. Some are posting from a public site and some are posting from managed access sites. I am using SIM and I have read about the Relay Response, but as far as I can tell I can only have one URL listed. That will not work for me as I need a different URL for each different point of entry into the ecommerce system. p  pMy problem at the moment is that I need to update a datafield via a guid upon successful payment completion to confirm purchase of a digital item, but if I put in a relay response page it is getting sent to all my access points and throwing errors. Other parts of the ecommerce system need to send different emails upon completion etc, plus all the urls are different at the top level. p  pIs there some other way of accomplishing this task that I am overlooking p

I saw that there is Git Publisher in postbuild actions and I could push changes to branch  reviewbranch or something like that and send notification to reviewers. They will pull repository and everything would be great. hmm also maybe instead of pushing to review branch, Jenkins should create pull request to that branch.

These sort of errors also occur with pow26,3, pow26,4 etc After some debugging after the contest i believe the answer has to do with the fact int rounds down.

Negative 2455 pI have a resque job that got caught up in some bad code and is infinitely getting requed after failing over repeatedly. Id like to remove the job manually, somehow, but Im not sure what the name of the job is in the redis namespace. It isnt in failed because Im catching the actual exception. In the exception, I add the job back to the resque queue using Resque.enqueuein. How do I figure out what the name of the job is in redis so I can delete the keyjob from ever happeningp
Negative 2455 pI opened this new question because this is about a desktop application, its not ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC and we dont use MVCContrib, this phenomena is not .NET version specific. We use NUnit and Moq however and a bunch of stuff too like Unity, IdeaBlade, DevExpress, Crystal Reports just to mention some of them. The symptom only comes using nUnit GUI, and its not predictable. Sometimes it doesnt come, but when something happens, lots of the test fail, for examplep  pcodeCompanyName.Shared.Services.Test.UnitTests.ApplicationServicesTest.CanLoginWhenLoginFailsReturnsFalse System.AccessViolationException  Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.codep  pIf the system gets into this state, it doesnt even help if I close nUnit GUI and open it up again. The only thing which helps is to emrebootem the machine  oO.p  pCan it happen that this is some bug with the nUnit GUI itself Im just saying, because we have 8500 tests and that makes up a emhugeem treeview content If all the tests run, nUnit consumes 2 GB RAM, and consumes significant amount of handles Im talking about the Windows native handle resource.p  pI tried NUnit 2.5.3 and 2.6.2, both of them are affected. Our solution was VS2008 for a long time and now its VS2012. It doesnt seem to be dependent on .NET version either.p

Negative 2455 pPart of my current project is comparing search results filenames only with a search string multiple words. I have a very basic mechanism I use at the moment to identify the relevance of a result, all handled with one function.p  pWhen the search begins, I split the search string into a string list of keywords...p  precodeprocedure TSearcherThread.ParseKeywords var   S, T String   P Integer begin   Clear current list of keywords   FKeywords.Clear   S LowerCaseTrimFSearchString   Remove all excess spaces   while Pos  , S gt 1 do     S StringReplaceS,   ,  , [rfReplaceAll]   if CopyS, LengthS1, 1 ltgt  then     S S     Parse out keywords   while LengthS gt 0 do begin     P Pos, S     T CopyS, 1, P1     DeleteS, 1, P     FKeywords.AppendT   end end codepre  pNow when Im iterating through the master list of files to be searched, I pass each filename into this function...p  precodefunction TSearcherThread.MatchKeywordsconst Filename String Single var   S String Temp keywords   FN String Filename   X Integer Iterator   C Integer Match counter begin   Result 0 Default no match   S TrimLowerCaseFSearchString Lowercase Keywords, trim outside spaces   FN LowerCaseExtractFileNameFilename Get lowercase filename   DeleteFN, Pos., FN, MAXINT Strip off extension leaving only the name    Check if exact match   if FN  S then Result 2    If nothing matches yet, then look for individual keywords...   if Result lt 2 then begin     C 0     if FKeywords.Count gt 0 then begin       Iterate through keywords       for X  0 to FKeywords.Count  1 do begin         If keyword is found in filename         if PosFKeywords[X], FN gt 0 then begin           IncC         end       end       Return how often keywords showed up       Result C  FKeywords.Count     end   end end codepre  pHow this works is the function passes back a decimal number of relevance. A result of 0 means no match, between 0 and 1 means partial match, where the higher the number, the better of a match, 1 means all keywords were found, and 2 means its an exact match. I can also do a comparison to only include results which have a certain percentage, like thisp  precodeM MatchKeywordsFilename if M gt 0.2 then AddResultFilename codepre  pThe problem is that my method above considers only emANDem operation, meaning it expects all the keywords, and compares how many keywords were found. However, I would like to also implement combinations of both emANDem and emORem operations together, which my structure doesnt support.

Negative 2455 pComplete novice, trying to create a personalizable Bible, where users can cycle through alternate translations of individual wordsphrases by clicking directly on said wordsphrases. I know I probably need some sort of for loop in the function, but I want their preferences to be stored as strings in cache and in user profile, so text should not reset to a default upon page load. Ideally I would have the alternate text options array embedded in HTML, as below, while keeping the HTML as uncluttered as possible. JS would eventually be populated with thousands of IDs, probably several per verse of the Bible, so the more generalizable the script, the better.

In fact the author mentions in the above thread If you were to launch Activities based upon the list selection, then you would not have the behavior where you swap the views that youre talking about.  and also You cant put an Activity into the above view. That doesnt really make sense when you think about what an Activity is. . p  pWhy doesnt it make sense Obviously, I am missing the point here.p  pQuestionp  pGiven that my project already contains multiple activities one corresponding to each screen, is my only option then to reorganize the project to have JUST 1 MAIN ACTIVITY, in order to use this library Or alternatively, is there any way to launch a new activity when a list item in the sliding menu is clicked, and still observe the sliding menu behavior, [strongEDITstrong added the last part to be more clear] or in other words, on how exactly to use this library within my existing app design. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2455 pI am new to codeblocks and quite unexperienced in c as well. I know there are many keywords, that I am not supposed to use for variable names and they are usually displayed in a different color, as they are in visualstudio. Now when I was copying some code fragments over from my old vs project to a new codeblocks project, some of my variable names suddenly got colored. For example in this code the variables begin and end are displayed in green now, and I dont understand why. p  precodeint begin  0 int end  4 int myarray[end] for int i  begin i lt end i      myarray[i]  i  codepre  pIn some cases, this code wont even compile and I get strange conflicting declaration errors. May I use these names anyway, or are they somehow reserved in codeblocks I looked into some books, but as far as I know, they are no c keywords. Is the reason, that I am using c11 now I am using v.12.11 of the ide and the mingw compiler, that comes with it. Thank you for your help.p

Negative 2455 pThe app in question uses both native and managed code. The managed code provides just the UI layer while it links with a native dll which performs bulk of operations. The native dll links with some other static dlls. Now the issue is when I run the app it crashes nondeterministically. When I debug the app under managed code debugging, it shows that a particular function in the native code threw an SEH Exception. Stack trace just shows the current function. The error code that I get in the SEH Exception is EFAIL.  However the app runs fine every time under native debugger. The function which throws the SEH exception is single threaded. It doesnt uses any resources which may be accessed in any other thread. What could be the possible cause for this behavior How should I go about detecting the origin of the exception in native code. Steppingin under the debugger doesnt helps since the issue doesnt shows up when the app is running under the debugger.p  pI am using visual studio 2012.p

I am rewriting the question to be more specific to the error.emp  hr  pI am trying to run a .NET 4.0 worker process reads from an SQS queue and writes the results to an RDS database on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

This works fine on my Win7 PC.p  pDeployment to Elastic Beanstalk Win Server 2013 appears to be working fine, but as soon as the service hits my thread method, I get a codeFileNotFoundExceptioncode. This was puzzling because the exception appeared to occur as soon as it hit my codeMainProcessingMethodcode and before any diagnostics could be produced.  After a bit of web searching, I found that missing packages amp assemblies in Windows services can produce a codeFileNotFoundExceptioncode, and often without any information as to what the missing assembly is. p  pI believe I have confirmed this.

Negative 2455 pI am trying to merge my free app and paid app.  The productFlavors of Androids new build system seem to be a perfect fit for my problem.p  pI have the freeApp flavor working great, however when I build the paidApp flavor the R file that is being generated is in a package structure that is defined in the freeApp.p  pHere is a snippet from by gradle.build filep  precodeproductFlavors  freeApp      versionCode 201308020     versionName 2.0.13free     packageName com.flyingspheres.android  paidApp      versionCode 201305110     versionName 2.0.10paid     packageName com.flyingspheres.android.inventory  codepre  pI always believed the R files location is defined by the package name in the manifest.  I verified that the manifest file is generating correctly.p  pThe problem is that the R file for both flavors is located in the same location.  Gradle demands that a manifest lives within the main source tree so whatever version of the manifest I put in the main source tree that is where the R.java file will be generated at.p  pAssuming that I get the R files to generate in the correct location for each flavor how are the import statements for the R file supposed to be managed so that each flavor references the correct R filep  pHere is a screen shot of my project structurep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXdiGt.png altenter image description herep  pEach AndroidManifest.xml file is a full and complete manifest  according to the documentation the manifest in the main tree should completely overwrite the product flavor version.  Although, that is clearly not happening, because the activity that should be launched and the content providers arent being overwritten.p  pAny insights to what Im doing wrong would be most appreciated.  This has to be a very common situation that anyone overriding the packageName would run into.  Ive been trying to figure it out for about a week now and cant seem to get there on my own.p  pThanks,p  pAaronp

Negative 2455 pHeres the deal I want to create a C console app.  When run, this app will look in a particular folder for dlls with classes that implement a particular interface, and then run a method on those dlls.p  pI havent done this before but from my reading that should be easy enough from an IoCNinject perspective.  I think you can do something with codekernel.Bindcode to load assemblies of a certain interface in a certain directory.  I thinkhope I can figure that part out if you know otherwise, please do tell.p  pBut here is my quandary.p  pHere is a visual to help firstp  precodeMainProgramFolder  MainProgram.exe  MainProgram.exe.config  LibraryFolder  Library1Folder Library1.dll Library1.dll.config  Library2Folder Library2.dll Library2.dll.config codepre  pThe dlls that implement this interface are technically stand alone apps  they are just libraries instead of exes or, rather, Id like them to be for IoC purposes.  Id like for them to be run in their own context, with their own app.configs.  So for example, MainProgram.exe would bind the ILibrary interface to classes inside Library1.dll and Library2.dll because they implement ILibrary.  But eminsideem Library1, it calls ConfigurationManager to get its settings.  When I call Class.Method for each of the bindings from MainProgram, how can I ensure they are referencing their own .configs and not MainProgram.exe.config  Also, fwiw, these additional libraries will likely not be a part of the assembly or even namespace of the main programs  were basically providing a drop folder for an application to kind of subscribe to the main programs execution.p  pIOW, I know you can attach an app.config to a class library but I wouldnt know how, after the bindings have been resolved from the IOC, to make those dlls see its own config rather than the main programs config.p  pAll thoughts appreciatedp  pThanks Tomp

Negative 2455 pGood evening,  please I have the same question already asked but not answered,a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq73116392969783Android MapActivity onLongPress  zooming mix upap  pthis is the question p  pI have a class extending codeMapActivitycode which has an overlay attached to it extending codeItemizedOverlaycode. Inside the overlay I have a codeGestureDetectorcode and a codeOnGestureListenercode. Now for my problemp  pI have an action which triggers in the codeonLongPresscode of the codeOnGestureListenercode but Android triggers this even when you zoom in  out using the pinch gesture. This is maibe due to the fact that one finger tends to stay in one spot while the other one moves towards  away. What kind of calls or checks could be implemented to detect whether the action is a pinchzoom or a codelongPresscode, so I know to either handle or disregard in onLongPressp  pthank you.p
Negative 2455 pIve implemented Spring Social and have successfully been able to implement the ProviderSignInController to authenticate connections to Facebook.p  pAs part of this I needed to implement the SignInAdapter interface. I understand this interface is used in the final steps of a successful authentication with a provider, specifically Im overriding the signIn method to log the client into my application programmatically after successful authentication with the provider.p  pMy problem is that when I implement the SignInAdapter it doesnt fire the signIn method on successful login. p  pThe code is almost straight out of the a hrefhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringsocialsamplestreemasterspringsocialshowcasesrcmainjavaorgspringframeworksocialshowcasesignin relnofollowSpring showcase examplesap  precodepublic class SimpleSignInAdapter implements SignInAdapter       private static final Logger logger  LoggerFactory.getLoggerSimpleSignInAdapter.class     private final RequestCache requestCache      Inject     public SimpleSignInAdapterRequestCache requestCache          this.requestCache  requestCache         logger.debugConstructing   SimpleSignInAdapter.class.getCanonicalName           Override     public String signInString localUserId, Connectionltgt connection, NativeWebRequest request           A social profile has been found. Now we need to log that user into the            application programatically.                      No other credentials are necessary here because by the time this method            is called the user will have signed into the provider and their connection            with that provider has been used to prove the users identity.                   logger.debugA social profile has been found.

As there could many children and sending the ids of every child will bloat the request payload.  Is there no way for emberdata to send the updated info of child with its new parent relationship key  Also this change caused error messages to start being raised within Qunit.  p  pemYou defined the parent relationship on subclass of DS.Model, but multiple possible inverse relationships of type subclass of DS.Model were found on subclass of DS.Modelemp
Negative 2455 pWe have a SQL Server on an internal network. Now however, we want to create a public web site that allows users to access some of the data on the SQL Server. To avoid giving the public web server direct access to the SQL Server, we have decided to write a web service to expose the necessary database objects. The service and consuming web site, for what it is worth is to be written in .NET. It seems to me we have two options here.  p  ul liWe already have IIS on the SQL Server for reporting services, so I could just build a web service that is hosted by IIS.li liWe already have a Windows service that performs other maintenance functions for the database in question, so I could use WCF and embed the web service functionality in the existing service.li ul  pI am leaning toward the IIS approach, as that one seems simpler.

Negative 2455 pIve got something I want to make  its a little scriptcodeappextension or something similar which will perform a very specific task for me. I have no coding experience whatsoever and Ive been going through the chrome basic developing guide for a week and dont feel Im getting anywhere. Ive got a very specific thing I want to do, and I dont want to waste time learning things that arent necessary to achieving it. Im not asking anyone here to do the work for me, I just need some pointers in the right direction as to what to learn. Without further ado Here is what I want my program to do ta dap  pThe primary function of the product is to refresh the booking page for a specific website, and when the date that I want to book becomes available, to select it in order to reserve it, and then notify me that the date has appeared. So p  ol liRefresh booking page periodically.li liWhen a range of dates becomes available e.g. any date between March 15th and April 15th, to select the earliest one by highlighting it and then clicking on it, as you would with a mouse. Ideally I could select this range of dates from the icon next to the OmniBox. li liA box will then appear asking if Id like to continue or cancel. I want the script to hit continue for me, so my date is reserved.li liI want to be notified when this happens, as the date is only reserved for 15 minutes and the page will time out if I dont proceed with the booking in that time. Receiving a text would be great, but this I imagine is too ambitious. So a notification which Ive sort of learnt how to do would work.li ol  pWhat do you guys think As I said I have no experience whatsoever with coding. Do you think it would be easier to do what I want to do some other way i.e. not with a chrome extension but with an independent script or an app or something. I have no idea what Im doing.

Negative 2455 pI have been taking an online class on relational databases and created an Access database for the first time to practice my SQL queries and solve a couple of workrelated problems along the way. The database consists of three tables, with the primary table being used to record company wide sales summary information at the branchstoremenu item level e.g. lowest level of detail and with three periods of data the database is presently 1.3GB with that one table containing 4,262,421 records. p  pEverything has gone well until I attempted to run the following queryp  precodeSELECT P1., P13.[Price] AS P13Price FROM SELECT  FROM PBASE WHERE Period  13 AS P13, SELECT  FROM PBASE WHERE Period  1 AS P1 WHERE P1.Key  P13.Key and P1.[Price]ltgtP13.[Price] codepre  pTo explain, the big table is PriceAccData and so I first ran a query PBASE that added a field to the PriceAccData that I can use as a key to compare price changes from one period to the next combination of branch, store, menu item. Then I used subqueries to create a data set from the last period of 2013 Period 13 and the first period of 2014 Period 1....from there I attempted to identify items that had changed in price from one period to the next in the Where clause.p  pIs there a more efficient way to write the query or to accomplish the comparison....it will work for one branch at a time, but takes a long time and locks up Access if I run it for more than one branch. p

I think limit needs to have a start and end value say 0,100 or start, finish but how can I let controller know about the same. Any feedbacksuggestion  I am new to the MVC world as well as phpmysql.p

Negative 2455 pThis is a bit of a complex one, and even trying to think it over is somewhat confusing.p  pBasically Im having to design a series of tables that will house information about many different pieces of electrical equipment. The arrangement of this equipment is quite complex, and can vary fairly drastically.p  pThe different types of equipment are as followsp  precodeRDC  Remote Distribution Center EBD  Electrical Bus Duct UPB  Upright Panel Board PDU  Power Distribution Unit codepre  pNow the way these units work together is slightly confusing as well.p  precodePDU  Powers RDCs, EBDs, and UPBs. They are often redundant, and have a secondary        unit that powers the same equipment in the event of a power failure.       Can also contain breakers and power equipment directly. RDC  Powers nearly all the equipment on the data center floors, are usually redundant.       They have two units side by side, being powered by a PDU. In the event of a        failure, the second RDC is activated and resumes operations. EBD  Nearly identical to the RDC, being phased out, but still needs to be tracked in a       similar fashion. UPB  Similar to an RDC, however, they are not redundant. codepre  pNow what Im trying to do is figure out the most simplistic method of tracking this crazy relationship between all the different itemsp  pI need to track the redundant sources for all possible hardware, but also what powers each unit. This can be quite complex because if two PDUs power a set of two RDCs, we need to be able to track exactly what goes where.p  pAny idea on exactly where to startp  pstrongEDITstrong Here is a visual representation of what Im after. The objects that are touching are redundant, and must be documented as such. Also, the different hardware that is connected to each device must be cataloged.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comW5vAn.png altRelationship Diagramp

Negative 2455 pI have a transparent, greyscale PNG of an icon. I want to be able to change its color like a fonticon.p  pA few more details The PNGs have outer transparencies and inner white areas for the actual icon, plus a small greyscale gradient so they have goodlooking fuzzy edges. Im armed with Image Magic, so I dont mind if I have to take negatives  otherwise perform transformations on the PNG prior to any solution. p  pWhy I cant just use a fonticon set We have some custom, proprietary icons were using, and Ive spend hours trying to convert them to a fonticon set with no success. So Im unlikely to find emourem icons out there, and I cant get our icons into a fonticon set. I could be doing it wrong, or I could have no found the right tool.p  pSo my next best bet looks to be using CSS Masking, only I cant get that work. The idea would be to set the background of the div to the correct color, and then mask out the div so only the part that corresponds to the icon is visible... but I cant get that working, either.p  pIm open to any ideas, but my gut says the CSS stuff is the way to go, unless theres some PNGFont tool I havent found.p  pSo to reiterate I have a greyscale PNG with transparency, and I need to show it on a website with a fontcolor set by CSS.p  pAny ideas Thanksp

Negative 2455 pIve searched for answers here many times, but this is my first time asking a question of my own.  I have about 15 years of Cf experience with versions 410, so, although Im no expert, I know what Im doing with most things.  p  pI currently have a project that I took over from another developer.  Part of the application outputs data from a SQL Server 2008 database to an Excel file that has three sheets or tabs, which are created in order, left to right.  I am working to fix a problem in which when opening the Excel file, the first and third sheets are grouped.  Next to the file name in the title bar, it says [Group] and both sheets appear to be active.  The problem with this is that, if the user were to, say, highlight row 5 in sheet 3, row 5 also gets highlighted in sheet 1.  I have searched everywhere with every search string I can think of and cant find anything  I even tried recreating a skeleton of the functionality based on the CF documentation and ran into the same problems.  I have figured out a few things on my own.p  pFirst, the middle sheet is not affected at all.  Second, once in Excel, if you select the middle sheet, everything else gets fixed of course, thats not a great solution for the end user.  Third, if I create the spreadsheet with xmlformat equal to false and output it as an xls, this problem goes away.  Finally, I tried adding an extra line of code to set the active sheet back to the first one once the third is generated.  This did break the grouping problem, but it undid any row or column sizing in the first sheet and I cant get it back.p  pMy code is below.

There also happens to exist another ACCDB with a single table in it with 6.5M rows that the FE links to with basic history info.  The two backends do not link to each other in any way.  The FE is 14MB, BE is 1.2G and the single table DB is 900MB, all with primary keyes and indexes setup appropriately.  The DB is 100 normalized.  Both BEs grow 5 every month.  The DB is currently slated to be migrated to an Oracle 11G environment later this year.p  pQuestion I found out recently that if I compact and repair the back end or front end that none of the forms containing subforms open the whole FE just freezes to white.

Preferably, though, I would keep the library simple and not require the user to do this.p  pIs there an AVR method attribute that can tell the compiler to only compile a virtual method if the class is being constructed somewhere Alternatively, are there compiler options that can enable me to optimize these unused virtual methods outp  pUsing the ATMEGA2560 AVR, with the G compiler.

Negative 2455 pI am working on a project and using MembershipReboot as the membership manager. I am using Guids for the keys instead of the ints used in the Single Tenant demo. My application can add UserClaims but I get an error when trying to remove or delete them. Some error about not being able to set a foreign key to null. There is only one foreign key in UserClaim, the ParentKey. I dont think the framework should be setting it to null anyway, it should be simply deleting the UserClaim, not modifying it. I can fix this by scanning the repository for modified UserClaims and deleting them, but this is a horrible kludge.

Negative 2455 pWe are planning development of a jewellery design tool for a magento site.  Something like gem vara has.We are looking towards some pointers as to what will be the best approach. We can use configurable products but the problem is with product images. For example, a pendant can have 1012 different kind of stones and we want to give user instant view of hisher selections. For example, if user selects a blue stone, we would like the stones on the pendant to be replaced and blue color stones loaded.  There are two challenges   1. If we create all images, the combinations would cross 200K images per product. 2. If we try to merge two images, and replace only the stones on selection, how we will define their position for each product p

Negative 2455 pI am trying to estimate bandwidth usage of a XMPP application.p  pThe application is receiving a 150bytes ping each second, and answering with a ping of the same size.p  pHowever, when I measure the data usage, I get something like 900 bytes per ping and not the 300 expectedp  pI have a suspicion this might relate to something layer bellow TCP IP and datagram sizes. But, so far, reading the TCPIP guide did not lead me anywhere.p  pAnother hypothesis would be that this overhead comes from XMPP itself, somehow.p  pCan anyone enlighten me p  p to get this 150 bytes I counted the number of chars in the codeltiqgtcode the xml representation of the pingp  hr  pI am using TLS, but not BOSH actually, BOSH on the other connection I am measuring results in the android client, and the pings are coming from a web application, but I think that should not matterp  pThe client is Xabber, running on androidp
Negative 2455 pMy meteor app has so far lived unsecured  meaning no redirection to https by default. This has worked fine in conjunction with the accountsfacebook package, which creates its own SSL enabled connection to Facebook when doing its OAuth magic.p  pMy problems started when I tried acessing my site using https instead of http. The popup window the accounts package opens to log into facebook halts quickly and by reading its console output I can see the following messagep  pcodeUncaught SecurityError Blocked a frame with origin httpwishlistfoobar.meteor.com from accessing a frame with origin httpswishlistfoobar.meteor.com.  The frame requesting access has a protocol of http, the frame being accessed has a protocol of https. Protocols must match.codep  pI thought this might have something to do with the site url in the apps facebook settings, but changing the http to https in that setting got me nowhere. Still got the same message. How is this supposed to work I am not hardcoding the http part of the path anywhere except the facebook settings, so this seems to be something the accountsfacebook package is doing.p  pThis is my app settings on Facebook. Observe the nonSSL site url.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com03mv6.png altenter image description herep
Negative 2455 pI am quite new to AngularJS. I have the following challangep  pI like to create an application offering 3 different modes, further called A, B and C. A mode in this case is more or less a view with many directives. All are fairly complex and share a lot of functionality. B is a pure extension of A. C is different from A and B.p  pI find it not very hard to create the directives, templates and controllers for those 3 modes. Mostly I have one main template for each mode using several directives which one exactly is dependend on the mode, some directives are used n all modes. I also have one base controller managing common user interaction which is shared for all 3 modes. Then I have 3 controllers that add the mode specific actions.p  pMy trouble is to find a good pattern to share common application logic for the 3 modes. My current approach is the following I am sure, there is a better onep  pI created a Service for each Mode as followsp  precodeangular.moduleapp.factorymodeAObject, function lng      return new ModeAObjectlng  codepre  pModeAObject extends a base Object by using Parasitic combination Inheritance Pattern an example can be found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16929353parasiticcombinationinheritanceinprofessionaljavascriptforwebdeveloperquotParasitic Combination Inheritancequot in Professional JavaScript for Web Developersap  precodefunction inheritPrototypechildObject, parentObject      var copyOfParent  Object.createparentObject.prototype      copyOfParent.constructor  childObject      childObject.prototype  copyOfParent   function BaseObjectlng      BaseObject.lng  lng  codepre  pModeAObject then has  the following structurep  precodefunction ModeAObjectlng      BaseObject.callthis, lng     this.someProperty        ...  inheritPrototypeModeAObject, BaseObject  Static variables ModeAObject.staticA   ...

How could that be done betterp
Negative 2455 pIm creating an android app in which I have to precisely know when playback startspausesbuffers etc I need to play a video only for specific time. However PlaybackEventListener is calling not proper callbacks. For example on Sony Xperia S here is the order of callback which are called by listener emBUFFERING, BUFFERING, PLAYING, BUFFERRING, BUFFERING and here is when the playback actually starts, yes not on PLAYING callback.emp  pOn the other phone not so popular  Telefunken Diamon callbacks are called more randomly sometimes its emBUFFERING, BUFFERING, PLAYING playback startsem, but sometimes the same as on Xperia S.p  pOn the emulator  GenyMotion API 4.3 the order and callbacks are proper  BUFFERING, BUFFERING, PLAYING playback starts.p  pI was trying with loadVideoString, int method and cueVideoString, int method, but the result is the same. strongHowever what I did notice is that when Im using those methods without initial offset second parameter like loadVideoString the order on all three phones looks the same BUFFERING, BUFFERING, PLAYINGstrong, but I need to seek the video, so anyone dealed earlier with something like that and can help Thanks in advancep

Negative 2455 pI want to autoscale a classification script, which we use to categorize new documents in our database. This is the first time I try to run a script on Amazon using autoscale, so Im very new to this. I need to scale this because of the CPU load and the amount of time it took to classify all documents by one server.p  pWe receive new documents which need to be classified, multiple times a day. I use Amazon SQS which stores the ids of the new documents and I use EC2 for the instances which processes the documents in the queue. By default I use 1 instance and according to the amount of messages in the queue I want to automatically scale add more instances. As far as I know each instance should run his own version of my script. p  pstrongThe classifierstrong The classifier is the machine where we put new documents in, and it returns the category which fits best. The classifier needs to be trained first so it knows which documents should be in which category based on documents we have categorized manually. I save the trained classifier to a file. I have problems with scaling this part. I dont know or anyone knows or this is even possible As you can see the classifier needs to train itself on all traindatap  precode Train a classifier with traindata     def trainclassifierself, classifier, traindata, subset  10000          train given classifier with given data         trainedclassifier  classifier.fittraindata.data[subset], traindata.target[subset]         return trainedclassifier codepre  pSo does anyone know or this is even possible to scale over multiple instances It can take quite some CPU to train a classifier and we dont know how big it may get in the future, if we get more root categories and more documents to train on.p  pThe classification part is easier. After the classifier is trained I save it to one file, which my classify scripts on each instance will use to classify one message from the queue at a time. So the last part is not a problem to realise, the training part is the part Im stuck with. So anyone who can helpp

Negative 2455 pFirst, my English is not very good. Do you know if there is a way to make grow vertically and specific record of a continuous form while keeping the rest of records from growing For example on reports if I set a textBox letGrow property to true, if the text inside that control occupies various lines the control grows, but just on that specific record. I would like similar behavior on forms normalView.p  pThankyoup

Negative 2455 pHow do you increment a variable name in loop in C For example I have a variable K1 and I want to increment the name by one everytime I go through the loop to K2, K3, K4 and so on. I cannot use an array as I have about 1000 variables to cycle through.p  pUPDATE I should have clarified that I am programming a microcontroller and the space on board is quite limited. The variable names I wish to loop through are structures, each 8 bytes long. Thus to create an array of the structures I have previously created, I would have to write out an array with 1000 array names Surely there is a way to increment the names I will post up my code in a moment.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltstring.hgt  typedef struct reg0      int address     union          struct              unsigned int bitfield1  1             unsigned int bitfield2  4             unsigned int bitfield3  2             unsigned int bitfield4  1                  uint8 DATA       Reg0  Beneath this I have 1000 similar Register structures, each unique   int main      Beneath this I have 1000 similar initializations, each unique     Reg0 R0  .address  0x0,      .bitfield10x1,.bitfield10x6,.bitfield30x2,.bitfield40x1  fori0ilt1000i     Here Id like to print each address field of each structure to the screen     printfAddress of Regd is , i, Ri   return 0 codepre  pp

Negative 2455 pI have a task where every image can be retrieved from multiple sources on the web. I am using node as a proxy service, so that when an image request is received, node internally hits those 34 sources available for the image and returns the first one that responds. p  pI also want to support image manipulation tasks like, cropping, resizing, rotation etc. For this I used imagemagick. But I understand that image manipulation being a heavy task will block the thread. Even if I put a CDN in front of the node server, it would still crash under a lot of load.p  pWhat is the best possible arrangement for such a task. Is there a possible workaround in node Should I switch all the code to some other technology Or should I keep the proxying part in node and manipulation part somewhere else  p

Negative 2455 pI am using the arcgisimage API to have map layers to my scatterplot.p  pHowever, the documentation for the API, found here a hrefhttpbasemaptutorial.readthedocs.orgenlatestbackgrounds.html relnofollowhttpbasemaptutorial.readthedocs.orgenlatestbackgrounds.htmla is not that good, especially concerning sizing of the imagesp  blockquote   pxpixels actually sets the zoom of the image. A bigger number will ask   a bigger image, so the image will have more detail. So when the zoom   is bigger, the xsize must be bigger to maintain the resolutionp      pdpi is the image resolution at the output device.

Negative 2455 pWe are building an app in AWS, using Node.js, for which we want to do continous deployment. We are using DynamoDB for the backend. We would like to use the URL swap for 0 downtime conversions.p  pIm trying to figure out the best way to do this. I can create a configuration using the node.js sdk that I can use to make a second environment, or use the eb CLI tool make a clone. But I dont know what resources these cover  for instance, if I specify a multiserver environment from 2 to 4 servers, itll start with 2. If the load increases to the point where we have 3 servers running, and I use clone or create a configuration, I believe that the new environment is only going to have two servers. Also, not sure about changes we make to alarms and security groups.p  pAnyone done this, and found a good way to do it Im pretty sure I can just slog through each type of resource, retrieving whats already there and adding them to the create scripts. But thats fairly complex.p  pWe have considered using the rolling update of whats in place, reusing the environment that is there. This is relatively easy, as it leaves everything as is, just updates the code. But then we have to manage what is going on with the data as some folks come in with the new code, and some come in with the old.p

Negative 2455 pJust a bit of background, Im running FreeNas in a virtual machine and I have setup CIFS shares within freenas. p  pNetwork Adapters on FreeNas 1  NAT and picked up the IP address of 192.168.136.131 2  Hostonly and it has an IP address of 192.168.80.128p  pFrom the host computer I can access the CIFS shares fine the VM I can access the share. But if I try and use a different computer I cant access it.p  pI can access the web management from other devices with port forwarding by going IP addressport in a Chrome and typing 192.168.0.109997 that port forwards to the vm with the NAT settings.p  pHow would I make it so I can access CIFS from other devices, can you port forward 445 Do you have to do ip addressport number in explorerp  pAny help out is a great helpp  pThanksp

Negative 2455 pIm creating a Django web app which features potentially very long running calculations of up to an hour. The calculations are simulation models built in Python. The web app sends inputs to the simulation model and after some time receives the answer. Also, the user should be able to close his browser after starting the simulation and if he logs in the next day the results should be there.p  pFrom my research it seems like I can use Celery together with RedisRabbitMQ as broker to run the calculation in the background. Ideally I would want to display progress updates using ajax, so that the page updates without a user refresh when the calculation is complete.p  pI want to host the app on Heroku, so the calculation will also be running on the Heroku server. How hard will it be if I want to move the calculation engine to another server It might be useful if the calculation engine is on a different server.p  pSo my question is, is my this a good approach above or what other options can I look atp

I have tried some simple methods in the past of making multiple calls for a single score and completing a checksum  fibonacci sequence etc, and also obfuscating the SWF with Amayeta SWF Encrypt, but they were all hacked eventually.p  pThanks to StackOverflow responses I have now found some more info from Adobe  a hrefhttpwww.adobe.comdevnetflashplayerarticlessecureswfapps12.htmlhttpwww.adobe.comdevnetflashplayerarticlessecureswfapps12.htmla and a hrefhttpsgithub.commikechambersas3corelibhttpsgithub.commikechambersas3coreliba  which I think I can use for the encryption. Not sure this will get me around CheatEngine though.p  pI need to know the best solutions for both AS2 and AS3, if they are different.p  pThe main problems seem to be things like TamperData and LiveHTTP headers, but I understand there are more advanced hacking tools as well  like CheatEngine thanks Mark Websterp

Figure out which ID has the greatest position for OFF ie, the one that started recording earliestbr 3.

Negative 2455 pI have a simple app that I am creating with a countdown timer that uses a codeDispatcherTimercode for the time base. I have an event handler setup for OnTick of the DispatcherTimer set for 1 sec interval. I have three 3 pivot pages using three different instances of codeAdControlcode and all are live with a real ApplicationID and AdUnitID. This timer is setup on one of the pivot pages.p  pWhat I am seeing is that when I open my app and the AdControl starts, after 60 seconds, the adControl wants to refresh. My timer works fine for the first minute, then starts to lose a second every three seconds, like it is missing a tick event coincidentally when the adcontrol scrolls to a new message every three seconds. Ive tried using a background worker for the dispatcherTimer but that did not seem to do anything for me. The code in the event handler is fairly short, with just a couple of ifthen statements and a few textBlock updates.p  pAnyone else seen similar issues with the AdControlp

Negative 2455 pAt my company we are using Java Web Start to distribute client software to the customers. They are using different Windows versions XP, Vista and 7.p  pWeve deployed a version through JWS with minimal problems in the past. Our latest release includes several file changes, some jars are gone, others appeared, etc.p  pWe found out that upgrade on Windows XP machines fails because JWS still tries to look up jar files which arent available anymore on the web server. Ive checked my HTTP servers log and the JNLP file never gets accessed from XP machines during application startup. If i try the same on Vista or Windows 7 everything works fine, JWS fetches the JNLP descriptor and downloads the differences when an update is available. So on XP machines only the known jar files gets updated and JWS throws an error if it doesnt find something from the cached JNLPs fileset.p  pIve written a servlet which manually generates the JNLP file. Im using the following header config in my servlet code.p  precoderesponse.setDateHeaderLastModified, lastModification  IE wont download JNLP file if CacheControl header presents response.setHeaderCacheControl, nocache, mustrevalidate response.setHeaderExpires, Mon, 26 Jul 1990 050000 GMT codepre  pThis makes the JNLP file always outdated which should trigger recheck of the file every time the client gets started through JWS.

But only on XP because of the white space characters in the deployment caches path Documents and Settings you know. Somebody says there that if i change the deployment caches path to something which dont have space characters in, it will solve the problem. Well its not an actual solution because users can hardly ever write to locations other than their profile.p  pBecause this bug exists for such a long time i guess there should be some kind of workaround. I dont like to tell the customer every time to clear the Java cache and reinstall the application from web. We like to move to a more faster release cycle in the future which will make this even worser. I hope someone has a good idea for this. p

Negative 2455 pheres my question, im developing a personal website that has a huge animation in the background, with clouds moving around in an infinite loop. Everything is done with jquery extended with jquery timers and sprites.  First it fills out the cloud starting position matrix random  it sets the actual position of each cloud.  start moving the clouds with .animate function and start a timer to fire again that animation until the clouds reach the left border.  repeat forever p  pAnyway this method consume a little memory and CPU, im trying to optimize the code, and i was wondering strongif theres a method to call a function when the browser switch to a different pagestrong, to stop the animation.p  pThanks.p  pPlus, if anyone would help in optimizing code, i will appreciate so much   Ill post the link to the website if anyone could help with that.

Negative 2455 pimport cern.colt.matrix.p  pI have a huge square sparse matrix say 30k30k and I need to get nonzero elements of a specific row to do some complicated math in a nested loop. The method forEachNonZeroIntIntDoubleFunction function is probably not good enough because it goes through every nonzero element of the matrix. p  pSparseDoubleMatrix2D has a method viewRow inherited from DoubleMatrix2D which returns DoubleMatrix1D. But this is still not good enough because with DoubleMatrix1D I have to go through every single elements in the row to find nonzero elements.p

Negative 2455 pWe have just redesigned our website with one major change being that our site is now SSLprotected. The URLs are otherwise the same except for the added s in the URL.

So we are witnessing some of the following in Webmaster Toolsp  precodenewdirectorynewwebpageaddress.phpotherwebpage.php codepre  pIt is almost as if the addition of the new htaccess code has deactivated the older code. We are essentially looking for a way to remove any additional something from the end of our URLs whilst also redirecting all pages to our https site. Any help would be very much appreciated.p  pUPDATEp  pI managed to fix this issue, I think. Not sure if it is ideal but it does appear to work. I placed the redirection from http to https in a htaccess file in the httpdocs folder and then the file redirections in a htaccess file in the httpsdocs folder. Seems to be OK.

Negative 2455 pI have this app on heroku the main part of it is called app.example.com for which I have custom domains on heroku, and added endpoint ssl to it. its all working. By the way, the original www.example.com is very old, and it is hosted somewhere else not on Heroku. p  pOn heroku, I just    p  precodeheroku domainsadd app.example.com codepre  pNow, we have an order form for user to order stuff before they get to use the app. and the client wants to have its url as order.example.com instead of app.example.comorder. I looked up routing constraint in Rails from RailsCasts to handle this subdomain redirect, so alls good. then I add it to herokus custom domainsp  precodeheroku domainsadd order.example.com codepre  pthen I change the CNAME on the original host of www.example.com to have it point order.example.com to myapps.herokuapps.com or something. And now accessing order.example.com does bring me to the order form Just that the https part is showing the usual nonverified cert warning.p  pSo I went ahead and got myself another godaddy certificate, but now when I try to add the certificate to heroku I have done this once before for app.example.coms httpsp  precodeheroku certsadd sslcombined.crt sslnopass.key codepre  pAdding SSL endpoint to orderdev... failed      only one SSL endpoint allowed per app try certsupdate insteadp  pSo it seems like I cant actually have more than one SSL certificate per app, does that mean I can actually use what I have for certificate for app.example.com for order.example.com also If so, what do I have to configure Or am I doing this all wrong, if so, what should I have done insteadp  pThank you for helping out herep
Negative 2455 pI have a webapp where my employees  take quizesMultiple choice question .I have to save user response in json format and submit the response to server when user hits the submit button but When a person is going through a quiz and suddenly its system crashes or shutdown due to some reason I want to be able to save the progress of user locally.What I want is to store that json data locally till the time user submits the quiz  and once user hits the submit button the local data should be destroyed.So that in case if system crashes I can collect the user progress from participant system manually.So is thr any way to store data locally using javascriptp
Negative 2455 pI have a .gif file which i wish to use as the background image for a button. The main reason i want to do this as i know some of you will wonder why i want to do it this way is because, a button relates to an instance of a class, and i want to monitor these classes. when a class and therefore button goes into an alarmed state, i wish i use these animated gif. ive triedp  precodemainUI.Controls[btn  device.deviceButtonNumber].BackgroundImage  System.Drawing.ImageProperties.Resources.redorange codepre  pBut it is to my understanding that .BackgroundImage does not support animated gifs. ive tried a few suggestions throughout stackoverflow and non of these seem to work for me, such as setting BackgroundImageLayout to center and such.p  pI suppose as a last resort i could get it to cycle through the images manually as if it were a gif, but this would create more work and id like to keep things simple. Any suggestionsp  pedit sorry, forgot to add, this is in Winforms.p  pedit 2p  pfor example. when i create my buttons dynamically, like sop  precode  Button btnAdd  new Button   btnAdd.Text  mDevices[i].deviceDescription   btnAdd.Location  new PointmDevices[i].deviceXPos.Value, mDevices[i].deviceYPos.Value codepre  pI can still accessp  precode btnAdd.Image  lt note i can access image. codepre  pthen when i come to modify them later from another thread, i find them like sop  precode mainUI.Controls[btn  device.deviceButtonNumber].text  blah blah  mainUI.Controls[btn  device.deviceButtonNumber].Location  blah blah codepre  phowever i CANNOT accessp  precode mainUI.Controls[btn  device.deviceButtonNumber].Image codepre

Negative 2455 pI have a details screen in Lightswitch that displays a couple of readonly fields using the label control.

I would have expected the label value to use a different textbrush setting to that of the label header.

All my protocols are supplied as C header files with all the typedef and structs in them and any changes made to the protocol in the future will be done in the same way.p  pMy question is, if there is any way to use them in Cp  pIve tried to compile them as a class into a DLL library but not working cause C can only use managed C dlls. If I try and compile as managed C class, it just becomes a mess due to the fact that there are many arrays in the protocol and because the C code has to conform to a bunch of mill specs, many of the variables have been typedefd. Now I could go and redo all the structures in C but thats going to take a lot of time and Im going to have to redo it every time a change is made or something added to protocol. Not even to mention the danger of errors slipping in every time I do it.p  pHow it worked with my C projects is that the other engineer would just supply me with the updated header files.p  pSo is there any way to use those header files directly in C or a automated conversion I can do every time the protocol is updated Well I basically need to use this header file to extract the data from the data stream coming over the TCPIP connection without begin able to use memcpyp  pReason for using C is because I use a lot of graphics in WPF and Visual C doesnt support WPFp  pAny help or suggestions would be much appreciatedp

Negative 2455 pThe codeorgmodecode has codeCaptureRefileArchivecode mechanism. I often use it to take notes and logs. I also want to use it to build my own vocabulary. For example, when I encounters some new words while reading some English text, I want to simply type codeCc c v ecode to record the word into my vocabulary file codeWordListEN.orgcode. I also want that words are categorized into Letters, e.g., codecashewcode will be recorded into entry codeCCAcode. I want to type codeCc c v Ecode to record my Esperanto words into some file like codevortaro.orgcode. How to config codeorgcapturetemplatescode to implement this I read the orginfo and still have no clue. The manual says that I can use something like codefunction functionfindinglocationcode. But I have to define my own codefunctionfindinglocationcode. Hope elisp masters can help mep

Negative 2455 pFunctional tests involving the codeTestServercode class of the emPlay Frameworkem seem to work only inside the Play console.p  pUnfortunately the stock test runner in the Play console executed by the codeplay testcode command executes the tests emin sequenceem and that takes a lot of time. I think they would run faster if they were executed parallel.p  pIs there a way to run the tests parallelp  pUpdate SBT supports running tests parallel and in different JVMs that makes it possible to have multiple codeTestServercode instances parallel if they are listening on different ports, in theory. It seems Play ignores these settings. See my reported issue a hrefhttpsgithub.complayframeworkPlay20issues849 relnofollowhttpsgithub.complayframeworkPlay20issues849a. The bounty goes for somebody who shows a way that makes the Play Framework honor these SBT test settings to run junit based tests parallel in different JVMs with a Build.scala file.p

Negative 2455 pIm reading a book on operating systems and it says we must set things up so that the portion of the added space allocated to global variables tensions allocated for the life time of the program, but that portion allocated for a local variable remains allocated only while the thread is in the variables scopep  pWhat I dont understand is when a program is loaded into memory isnt the addresses reserved for it static Its not like when a variable goes out of scope the operating system sees the address space where the variable was is at can be used by another program now, or is itp  pThe book says that global variables are stored in memory and local variables are stored in the run time stack. First of all the run time stack is in memory so I dont see the distinction. How does the operating system know how much space to allocate for the run time stack since the number of items to be pushed on cant be determined before runtimep

Negative 2455 pa R novice is once again seeking for help.p  pGeneral situation I am currently creating a script, I got several data frames per experiment. The experiments vary in timesteps of measurements and number of reactors, therefore I need two dimensional flexibility of my script to massage data into the right shape for  the desired tests, and draw the necessary data from multiple data frames. Unfortunately I choose to use for loops to account for this, which I see now is bad practice in R,  but I have gotten to fare to change directions now.p  pThe Problem  I try to achieve that one dimensional matrix are named by the objects names, inside a for loop, I need them to be in matrix format because of further functions I want to apply.p  precode Simple but non flexible examples of what I want to do   creates two matrix objects a1 lt matrixc1,2,3,4,5 a2 lt matrixc1,2,3,4,5  names header of the objects name colnamesa1 lt a1 colnamesa2 lt a2 codepre  pthis works, but I need it to work with in a for loop...p  precode here are the two flexible but non working approaches of mine   creates two matrix objects a1 lt matrixc1,2,3,4,5 a2 lt matrixc1,2,3,4,5   should name object according to progress in loop fori in 12   assigncolnamespastea,i,sep,collapse,do.callc,listpastea,i,sep  codepre  pwhich isnt the proper use of assign and  creates an error. the second attempt doesnt create an error but doesnt work either, it creates empty objectsp  precode creates two matrix objects a1 lt matrixc1,2,3,4,5 a2 lt matrixc1,2,3,4,5   should name object according to progress in loop fori in 12            assignpastea,i,sep, colapse,do.callcolnames,listpastea,i,sep, colapse      codepre  pMy conclusion I do not understand the proper way of combining assign, and colnames,  If anyone got suggestion how I could get it up and running, this would be awesome.p  pSo fare I searched for  R combining assign and colnames inside for loop, R using assign and colnames, R naming data with for loops,...  but unfortunately  didnt manage to extrapolate solutions to my problem.p

Negative 2455 pHow can I add a different text to each header and footer of each page in LibreOffice Writer If I edit the header of a page, the text automatically changes on the others. I want them to behave independently.p  pEDIT What I would like to achieve is this lets say I have 7 pages, the first one doesnt have neither a header or a footer, its just a simple page with an image.  The second page should have an INDEX header and a footer at the bottom of the page with the page number 2 on the right. The third page should have another header, or better a header with a different text, different textsize and with italic style, and the footer should have the page number 3, and so on.p  pIf I click InsertFieldsNumber of pages I get the total of the pages of my document and this is not what I am looking for. But also clicking on InsertFieldsNumber of page doesnt help cause if I have e.g. the INDEX page and I click on InsertFieldsNumber of page, I get the number 3 instead of the number 2. Also I have noticed that my footer style is different on some pages, how can I make it the same for every pagep

I would still use the normal resolution of dependencies for my project, but the other person  who doesnt use CMake  would have to manualy link multiple libraries to his project, which is somewhat inconvenient. A single library would solve this. p  pOn my way of trying to get CMake to staticly link two static libraries, I read somewhere sorry, I havent saved a link that at least when using Visual Studio as a compiler you can get the result I want if I append the full path of the static library to be linked to the static linker flags like thatp  precodesettargetpropertiesB PROPERTIES STATICLIBRARYFLAGS gtgtgtINSERTPATHHEREltltlt codepre  pwhich does in fact work. But now Id have to manualy insert the fully qualified path to the variable therep  precodesettargetpropertiesB PROPERTIES STATICLIBRARYFLAGS pathtolibrary.lib codepre  pwhich doesnt seem to be a good way to do it to me. So I experimented with generator expressions and came up with the following onep  precodesettargetpropertiesB PROPERTIES STATICLIBRARYFLAGS ltTARGETFILEAgt codepre  pwhich doesnt work, for reasons I dont fully understand. I guess settargetproperties just doesnt support generator expressions. While trying to get my project to work I tried p  precodeMESSAGEltTARGETFILEAgt codepre  pas stated above this explenation and thought that if Id get that statement to work I could solve my real problem. So thats what I asked the question posted above. I didnt realise that this would lead to confusion for the people trying to answer me.p

Negative 2455 pi am still learn about andengine. I am in project to make a live wallpaper, but I have a problem during rotate the screen. Likes most live wallpaper, when the screen rotated from landscape to portrait, the background and sprite are not distorted and keep maintaining aspect ratio. The screen is cropping the background. Let say i have landscape background with widht 800 and height 480, with three sprites to display. first sprite is on the left edge of the background, second sprite is in the middle of the background, and the last sprite on right edge. When android device is rotated from landscape to portrait, the background is cropped and make the screen just display the middle part of the background with only one sprite that i put in the middle of the background that can seen in the screen. My question is how to do that, I try to use CroppedResolutionPolicy, but the screen is not change when i rotate the android device. Landscape keep landscape even i put in portrait and use the LANDSCAPESENSOR. sorry for my english. thanks any way.p

The problem with that is it takes too long for larger files and I am tryingwithout luck to find an implementation of an algorithm to get the median of an unsorted Arrayor ArrayList.p  pFrom what I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10662013findingthemedianofanunsortedarrayherea, the Median of Medians algorithm is used followed by QuickSelect but I cannot find an actual implementation that is easy enough to understand. p  pHeres a snippet of my code that finds the median of an ArrayList of size codefilterSizecodep  precodewhileelements.sizecounter gt filterSize             forint i  0 iltfilterSize i                 tempElements.addthis.elements.geticounter                 ififilterSize                     break                                            Collections.sorttempElements Sort tempElements to find median             outputElements.addtempElements.getfilterSize12 Add median to an output ArrayList after calculating median index              counter             tempElements.clear Removes all elements from the tempElements and start again          codepre  pBasically Im trying to avoid the whole use of codeCollections.sortcode and codetempElements.clearcode in the code, thus the reason to find a better algorithm for finding the median in linear time.p  pThanks.p

On my laptop with VS2015, I get 1044ms with 100 million swaps for sort and 824ms with 10 million swaps for shuffle. p  plibstdc and libc do twice as few swaps for sort 50M and the results are as follows. Rextester gives me similar results a hrefhttprextester.comSEJQZ64474 relnofollowemgccema sort 854ms, shuffle 565ms, a hrefhttprextester.comTXMD25534 relnofollowemclangema sort 874ms, shuffle 648ms.

Is it the cache misses that make shuffle relatively slowp  pPS the behaviour is the same for simple codestdvectorltintgtcodep
