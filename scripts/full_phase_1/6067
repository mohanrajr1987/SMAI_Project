Negative 6067 pIve just got this idea that there is a need for a forked version of Firefox that would provide right out of the box tools for web development. Like FireBug, YSlow, FireCookie, LiveHTTPHeaders, etc.p  pMaybe the fork should only include those extensions or take a further step and implement them in existing chrome.p  pThe reason Im thinking about this is that right now I have two Firefox profiles. A browsing one which has only one extension and a development one which has lots and lots of extensions. The advantage is obviously that the former is faster than the latter. Maybe if aimed from the beginning at developers, a forked version would bring some speed improvements and other niceties.p  pWhat do you think Any volunteersp
Negative 6067 pLets take a concrete example and hope I can be clear. Suppose the ordered list of monthsp  blockquote   pJanuary lt February lt March lt ... lt   Decemberp blockquote  pwith integers that stand for the months, zerobased, such that p  blockquote   pJan is 0, Feb is 1, ..., Dec is 11.p blockquote  pNow suppose I do not have access to the full names of months, and am given the following list, where months have been shortened to their first letter, and emeem stands for an empty category, like thisp  blockquote   pe, F, e, e, ep blockquote  pIf I build a list of unambiguous months f1, s8, o9, n10, d11, I can fill the empty categories by by first calculating the first category using subtraction and mod 12, and then write the rest from there. However, suppose I am given the listp  blockquote   pe, A, e, e, J, ep blockquote  pThen I can intuitively calculate that although emAem is ambiguous could be April or August, in this context it can only be April, since August does not have any emJems following it after 2 categories. Once I find this, I can again calculate everything from the start. p  pMy question, finally, is is there an analytic solution function, algorithm for this problem, or is my only hope to use brute force to define each potential relation For some examples, no disambiguation algorithmfunction can work consider the case where I have a emJem followed by 11 emeems, followed by a emJem followed by 11 emeems ...

Negative 6067 pInspired by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1483383isthisstoredprocedurethreadsafeorwhatevertheequivisonsqlserverthis questiona where there are differing views on SET NOCOUNT...p  blockquote   pShould we use SET NOCOUNT ON for SQL Server If not, why notp blockquote  pstrongWhat it doesstrong Edit 6, on 22 Jul 2011p  pIt suppresses the xx rows affected message after any DML. This is a resultset and when sent, the client must process it. Its tiny, but measurable see answers belowp  pFor triggers etc, the client will receive multiple xx rows affected and this causes all manner of errors for some ORMs, MS Access, JPA etc see edits belowp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pGeneral accepted best practice I thought until this question is to use codeSET NOCOUNT ONcode in triggers and stored procedures in SQL Server. We use it everywhere and a quick google shows plenty of SQL Server MVPs agreeing too.p  pMSDN says this can break a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter.aspx.net SQLDataAdaptera.p  pNow, this means to me that the SQLDataAdapter is limited to utterly simply CRUD processing because it expects the n rows affected message to match. So, I cant usep  ul liIF EXISTS to avoid duplicates no rows affected message emNote use with cautionemli liWHERE NOT EXISTS less rows then expectedli liFilter out trivial updates eg no data actually changesli liDo any table access before such as loggingli liHide complexity or denormlisationli lietcli ul  pIn the question marcs who knows his SQL stuff says do not use it. This differs to what I think and I regard myself as somewhat competent at SQL too.p  pIts possible Im missing something feel free to point out the obvious, but what do you folks out there thinkp  pNote its been years since I saw this error because I dont use SQLDataAdapter nowadays.p  pstrongEdits after comments and questionsstrongp  pEdit More thoughts...p  pWe have multiple clients one may use a C SQLDataAdaptor, another may use nHibernate from Java. These can be affected in different ways with codeSET NOCOUNT ONcode.p  pIf you regard stored procs as methods, then its bad form antipattern to assume some internal processing works a certain way for your own purposes.p  pEdit 2 a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1354362trigger breaking nHibernate questiona, where codeSET NOCOUNT ONcode can not be setp  pand no, its not a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions995589setnocountofforreturnrowcountthisap  pEdit 3 Yet more info, thanks to my MVP colleaguep  ul lia hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comscidkb3Benus3B240882ampx4ampy9KB 240882a, issue causing disconnects on SQL 2000 and earlierli lia hrefhttpsqlmag.comsqlserver2000seeingbelievingDemo of performance gaina li ul  pEdit 4 13 May 2011p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq588041327535Breaks Linq 2 SQL too when not specifiedap  pEdit 5 14 Jun 2011p  pBreaks JPA, stored proc with table variables a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq634463127535Does JPA 2.0 support SQL Server table variablesap  pEdit 6 15 Aug 2011p  pThe SSMS Edit rows data grid requires SET NOCOUNT ON a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq706732927535Update trigger with GROUP BYap  pEdit 7 07 Mar 2013p  pMore in depth details from RemusRusanubr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1915405doessetnocountonreallymakethatmuchofaperformancedifference19180851918085Does SET NOCOUNT ON really make that much of a performance differenceap

Negative 6067 pI encountered a head scratching modelling problem todayp  pWe are modelling a physical control system composed of strongDevicesstrong and strongNetworkDevicesstrong. Any example of a strongDevicestrong is a TV. An example of a strongNetworkDevicestrong is an IR transceiver with Ethernet connection.p  pAs you can see, to be able to control the TV over the internet we must connect the strongDevicestrong to the strongNetworkDevicestrong. There is a one to many relationship between strongDevicestrong and strongNetworkDevicestrong i.e. TV only has one strongNetworkDevicestrong the IR transceiver, but the IR transceiver may control many strongDevicesstrong e.g. many TVs.p  pSo far no problem.p  pThe complicated bit is that every strongDevicestrong has a collection of strongCommandsstrong. The type of the strongCommandstrong e.g strongIrCommandstrong, strongSerialCommandstrong  N.B. not currently modelled emdependsem on the type of strongNetworkDevicestrong that the strongDevicestrong is connected to.p  pIn the current legacy system the strongDevicestrong has a collection of generic strongCommandsstrong no typing where fields are interpreted depending on the strongNetworkDevicestrong type.p  pHow do I go about modelling this in OOP such thatp  ul liYou can only ever add a strongCommandstrong of the appropriate type, given the strongNetworkDevicestrong the strongDevicestrong is attached toli liIf I change the NetworkDevice the Commands collection changes to the appropriate typeli liMake it so the API is simpleelegantintuitive to useli ul

Negative 6067 pI have three columns in my data table. p  p1 ProductID br 2 ProductParentID br 3 ProductTotal brp  pProductID and ProductParentID are self refrencing columns where i can set parent child relationship and get child rows based on my relationship.

E.g if Product 131 total is 10,Product 13 total is 15 and Product 133 total is 5 then the product 13 total should be  30. The logic should work for n number of self hierarchy.p  pIs there any functionality in data table itself where i can achieve this without iterating through each row and do it manually p  pThanks.p

Negative 6067 pI would like to create a simple drawing lines, circles, squares, etc... but Im having difficulty figuring out the best way to do this.  The drawing would need to be scaled to fit the display since the size is indirectly specified by the user like in a CAD application.  Also, I dont want to take up the entire display, leaving room for some controls buttons, etc.  I would pass the data to describe the drawing.  Heres how I imagine it would work.p  pI create an XML layout that contains something that holds the drawing ImageView, BitmapDrawable, ShapeDrawable, ... not sure exactly what.  Then in my Activity I would load the main XML and obtain the resource for the control that holds the drawing.  I would then draw to a bitmap.  Once the bitmap was completed I would load it into the control that is to hold the drawing.  Somewhere along this path it would be scaled to fill the entire area allocated for the drawing in the XML layout.  p  pI dont know if my approach is the way to do this or what classes to use.  I read the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsgraphics2dgraphics.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsgraphics2dgraphics.htmla documentation, but its not helping me with an example.  The examples I do find leave me with hints, but nothing concrete enough to do what I want, especially when it comes to scaling, using XML andor having other controls.  Also, there seems to be no good documentation on the design of the 2D drawing system in a more conceptual manner, so it makes what I read difficult to put into any useful context.  p  pAny hints on what classes would be useful andor a good example any other reading materials  p  pThanksp

Negative 6067 pI have five consumers and one producer. The five consumers each output different data, from the one producer, for 10ms. During those 10ms the producer prepares the parameters for the next output. When the output parameters are set, I want to set a flag instructing the consumers to begin the next output. I only want the producer to produce when the consumers are outputting the data. p  pI am unsure how to synchronize the five consumers and the single producer. I currently have two flags, runFlag and doneFlag. When a consumer reads the new data I want to set runFlag to true so the calculations begin, and I want to set doneFlag to false, as the calculations have not completed. However, if I set doneFlag to false in one consumer it may be false in another consumer before that consumer can check the flag. p  pI hope my question is specific enough.

Negative 6067 pIm developing an app that will need to import data for three models from a single CSV file with onetomany associations. I have set up a Datafile model amp controller to handle upload  parsing of the file. Right now, all the logic for parsing and saving the records is in the controller. This allows me to save to several different models, get the IDs for the saved records, and create associations as necessary while the file is being parsed.p  pThinking about the fat model, skinny controller principle, I realized I have about 150 lines of code in a controller that is really just processing data. As I started looking at moving this to a model, though, I concluded I would have to process all of this data into arrays without knowing association IDs, and send it back to the controller to be saved since the model cant call methods from other models. Im anticipating having about 1,500 records in the import file. Im using CakePHP, which has a codesaveAllcode method to save data to several models simultaneously from a single array.p  pAnother option would be to have each of the three models separately parse the file, ignoring any data it doesnt need. This should be possible, as long as I send it to the models in the right order, and give the belongsTo models a list of possibly associated records to search.p  pSo  any advice on these options p  ol liLeave the parsing code in the Datafile controller as it is.li liMove all the parsing code to the Datafile model, then pass back a large array to be saved through the Datafile controller.li liSend the file separately to each of the three models, along with supplemental lists for determining associations.li ol

Negative 6067 pSo this is a very weird situation, and Im sure not very pythonic. But Im not actually using this in any production code, Im just considering how if this could work. It doesnt have to be python specific, but Id like a solution that at least WORKS within python framework.p  pBasically, I have a thread safe singleton object that implements codeentercode and codeexitcode so it can be used with codewithcode.p  precode Singleton     l  threading.Lock     enter         l.acquire     exit         l.release codepre  pIn my example, one thread gets the singleton, and inside the codewithcode statement it enters an infinite loop.p  precode def infinite     with Singleton         while True             pass codepre  pThe goal of this experiment is to get the codeinfinitecode thread out of its infinite loop WITHOUT killing the thread. Specifically using the Singleton object. First I was thinking of using an exception called from a different threadp  precode Singleton     ....     def killMe         raise exception codepre  pBut this obviously doesnt raise the exception in the other thread. What I thought next is that since the enter and exit methods acquire a class variable lock, is there any method that can be called on the codeLockcode that will cause the thread that has acquired it to throw an exceptionp  pOr, what I would probably do in C is just delete codethiscode or somehow call the destructor of the object from itself. Is there ANY way to do this in python I know that if its possible it will be a total hack job. But again, this is basically a thought experiment.p

Negative 6067 pHeres the background of the underlying problem, I am collaborating with a group on a project which uses codeSwtcode libraries and I am trying to package the software for deployment. As it turns out codeSWTcode is very platformarchitecture dependent. I would like to be able to package all six codejarcodes linux, mac, win and 3264bit into the same package and use the appropriate library depending on the system. I realize that it is a tough challenge however, switching to codeSwingcode or anything else isnt really an option right now.p  pI have found a number of relevant threads a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2037220howcanicreatingexecutablejarwithswtthatrunsonallplatformsAaron Digullas threada and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2706222createcrossplatformjavaswtapplication32040323204032mchrs threada which provided me valuable insights regarding the problem at hand. I have tried to implement the solution proposed by Alexey Romanov a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2706222createcrossplatformjavaswtapplication32040323204032herea. With one difference, as the codeloadSwtJarcode method he proposes is not static, I instantiate the object, and immediately following that, run the method before anything else is done to the object. p  pIt appears as the loading procedure doesnt work properly. My reasoning for this statement is as follows p  ul liIf all codeSwtcode jars are removed from the classpath of the executable jar file, then codeException in thread main java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError orgeclipseswteventsMouseListenercode is thrown which is caused by codejava.lang.ClassNotFoundException org.eclipse.swt.events.MouseListenercode li ul  pto me this means that the libraries are not found on classpath, am I mistakenp  ul liIf codeswtcode jars are left on the classpath then the first jar file is used by the system during execution. Meaning if gtklinuxx8664 happens to be the first swt jar on the list of jars then the system tries to use that, regardless if the system is win32 or Mac OSX.li ul  pI have tried to add some output to see if the codeloadSwtJarcode method is choosing the right jar, and the output seems right on all platforms I have tried, as in the right package is selected and the files do exist in the runnable jar. But nevertheless the right library is not loaded hence execution errors occur  codeException in thread main java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetExceptioncode caused by for ex codeCaused by java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError Cannot load 32bit SWT libraries on 64bit JVMcode  Note that this is the error I get on my Linux machine if I change the order of appearance of 64bit and 32 bit swt libraries on the codebuild.xmlcode filep  pSo, what seems to be the problem here Am I missing out on some detail, or is it simply not possible to check system properties and load an appropriate library accordingly p  pFinally below is an excerpt of my build file, figured it might help finding the source of the problem. p  pThanks in advance,p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong After a long debug session with a colleague, the problem is resolved except an annoying bug regarding Thread management on MacOS as I mentioned a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2746539problemswithswtonmac30496083049608herea. It involved tweaking with the ANT build as well as the way the main class was written. The main class, as it turns out, was extending amp implementing references from the SWT library which meant that the code wouldnt compile at all, wrapped the main class with another class and loaded the SWT jars from there which seemed to be enough to tackle the problem p  pThanks and regards to everyone who contributed, especially Aaron.

Obviously I need exact match, so how could a LIKE statement exact match inside a stringp  pb I see a speed problem, using LIKE would I guess take more mysql take than  using the first approach where I exact match a word. On the other hand in the first option I need 2 statements, one to get the ID of the word and second to get all the words with this ID.p  pHow would you solve this problem, more of a dilemma which approach to take Is there a third way I dont see that is easy for admin to addedit synonyms and in the same time fast and optimal Ok I know there is no best way usually p  pstrongUPDATEstrong The solution to use two tables one for master word and second for the synonym words will not work in my case. Because I dont have a MASTER word that user types in search field. He can type any of the synonyms in the field, so I am still wondering how to set this tables as I dont have master words that I would have IDs in one table and synonims with ID of the master in second table. There is no master word.p

Negative 6067 pI have written quite a bit of code of the past few years.  Ive been using the Visual Studio Development Environment for my C code, but I wouldnt call myself an advanced user of Visual Studio.  I can create projects, create source code, and builddebug the project.  I dont use many of the advanced features of the IDE, so perhaps there is a simple way to do what Id like.p  pMy code is often reused  especially thing like filter tools, custom controls plotsetc and some communications code COMUSBetc.  Every time I create a new project, I end up importing a lot of code that Ill need.  This code is copied to the new project directory.  If I end up editing that code in some way, I then need to update all of the other versions of that file in my others projects.  Im always having to verify that the code that I am importing is the latest and greatest.p  pI know it is possible to add code to your project by link, and then youll update the source file, but Im curious if there is a better way.  My example of a better way is the Allegro Lisp compiler.  When you start up Allegro, all of your code is loaded into Allegro, and is instantly available.  Then you can start hacking around on anything youd like, and have access to all of your previous code.  When you edit something, and compile it, it is instantly usable in the rest of your projects as well.  Usually even if the program is open  Perhaps this is something fairly unique to Allegro Lispp  pAre there any ways to do something like this in C  Id like to still be able to keep separate projects, but Id like to share source between them and not have to worry about versions getting out of sync.

Negative 6067 pHey guys. Im having an issue with using a datagridview for a user entering data thats saved to a database. Basically, I just want them to throw stuff into a row and then my code will insert the data. I know there has to be some event for what Im trying to and I just cant figure it out.p  pI tried the LeavingRow event, but the problem with that is that the final value hasnt updated when this event triggers. What I mean is, say we have a row with four columns, and the user has entered data into the first three columns. They enter info in the last column, then push down to enter a new row. The insert fails, because it thinks the last column is still empty.p  pI also tried UserAddsRow, but had that fail because it triggers as soon as the user starts typing to add a row, so there would be only a single character in the first column of the row I was trying to add.p  pDoes anyone have suggestions for getting these, or some other event working for my purposesp  pThe two inelegant alternatives Im weighing are a stringing together some labelstextboxes and an add button or b using the DataGridCellValueChanged event, by having some nested trycatch that will try to insert first, then if it fails try to update, and then do nothing if the update doesnt work. Its grossly inefficient, but I think it would get the job done since theres only going to be a couple dozen rows tops at one time in this datagridview.p  pThank you for your time.p

I have a header div tag that holds the logo. Next, I have the navcont that is a menu with hidden drop down menus. Lastly, the rest of the content is in the content div tags. p  pIve aligned the menu to appear to the user that it is level and within by centering it using absolute, thus not pushing content down when the dropdowns appear.p  pHowever when I shrink the browser the navcont continues to move off screen even though header and content have stopped. If I use relative or just margin 0 auto it minimizes fine, but again my problem is that it pushes the content down when the dropdowns are shown.p  pI hope im making sense. Thanks.p
Negative 6067 pmy question is somewhat related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3581824searchbuttoninsidethesearchboxlikebingSearch button inside the search box like Binga. I plan to use a similar control to provide search facility within my desktop application. The search box is somewhat like the search box given in the windows explorer in Windows 7 where the text search appears and when the user enters text to search itll show suggestions and close matches. Also when the search query is cleared therell be a slight transition such as a fade out, so that the entire control looks smooth in operation.p  pI havent done this using MFCWindows programming, but Ive a feeling this should be easier on Qt.

Negative 6067 pAs Im currently adding more unit test to our code, Im stuck because of a simple problem.p  pI need to write some boilerplate code to make it easy to write test classes. For example, to connect to the database without the configuration of the Resin server, using JNDI injection.p  pMy problem is where can I put boilerplate code that is only related to tests Of course, it needs to be in my test directory, but is it good practice to create a package, call it tool, in my package tree, as this package will have no equivalent in the package tree of the project source Why or why notp  pEditp  pLets take an example I need to create a class to inject a database connection into my test classes. Lets call it JNDIDatabaseInjector. This class will obviously only be used for test purposes, as the database connection used in production is defined in the application server configuration. In which package should I best put my JNDIDatabaseInjector classp

Negative 6067 pI am programming for my End Project an application that should have VoIP capabilities. I have started testing with the new SIP API that android 2.3 includes. The problem is that I am actually living in a students dormitory, so I am connected to the internet through the buildings proxy and it seems to have a strict firewall that doesnt let anything pass.p  pI have tried several free SIP servers and clients and the result is always the same from my UAC I can see if other clients are online, I even can send text messages, but it is impossible to establish an actual call. I never get any response from the client called. Using a Linphone client I cant even connect to the SIP server to authenticate.p  pThe thing is, that it seems I cannot make calls outside my building, but I have successfully contacted a Linphone client installed on my PC from another Linphone client installed on an emulator. Apparently I can make calls inside my local network without any SIP server, just by using the local address of the receiver instead of its SIP domain.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiJJmT.jpg altScreenshot 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9ki0W.jpg altScreenshot 2p  pThe question is Can I do the same with the new android 2.3 SIP API Can I make a call eminside my local networkem just by calling the receivers local address, without the necessity of authenticate with any SIP server outside my buildingp  pAs my application is for demonstration purposes, this will be enough for me.

Negative 6067 pI would like to instantiate memory for a boolean array in C and pass this to a C library function using interop. Then the C function should fill up the array with data result so that the data can passed back to C and used there. Since arrays are reference types and since I explicitly set the [In, Out] marshalling attribute for the array I thought this would be a piece of cake. But apparantly not.

I.e. the res value is correct as well as the first array element, but not the second one. So it seems that the boolean data is not marshalled correctly unless I am missing something obvious. p  pI am guessing it also would be possible to declare a IntPtr instead of an array and succesfully marshal the two elements to the correct result. However, since I want the array to be allocated in memory in C, I am not sure how to do this. p  pMuch obliged for help on this. Im kind of stuck here. p  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong I am guessing that it is due to that boolean is only 1 byte long and that the C code does not get this information. So how do you specify thisp

Negative 6067 pWhen developing an Java EE Application, I often came across the problem to do stuff when the application is started, stopped etc. Now for Weblogic for example, there is a mechanism for that the application lifecycle listener. But if you want to keep your application free from stuff that is app. server specific, you have to find a different solution. Some recommend using a servlet that is loaded on startup, and abuse the codeinitcodecodedestroycode. p  pOthers say use a codeServletContextListenercode. To me, the last one sounds best according to the java doc for a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavaee6apiindex.htmljavaxservletServletContextListener.html relnofollowcodeServletContextListenercodea. Unfortunately, today I tried JBoss 7, where it seems that jaxws webservices are initialized before any other codeServletcode, thus before the codeServletContextListenercode gets a notification.p  pLong story short  am I just facing some app server specific issues here  or is there any more appropriate, standardized Java EE way to register things, do stuff, before any webservice, servlet, whatsoever is initializedp

Negative 6067 pIm designing a new application, and there is a table with items that the users would like to uniquely identify with a number.  This table will have a surrogate key, which can be used for this purpose, however Im undecided if I should expose it to the users.  They will only use this id as readonly and lookups, and the application will handle the creation of the key behind the scenes.p  pThe idea is to avoid potential problems down the road.  If the key is an identity field, auto generated by the dbms, then you dont have control over the key. Im using NHibernate in my application, so I can have control over the key by using HiLo, as described a hrefhttpnhforge.orgblogsnhibernatearchive20090320nhibernatepoidgeneratorsrevealed.aspx relnofollowherea, which I intend to use.  In case it matters, the DBMS is Oracle.p  pWhat are some of the potential issues I could encounter down the road by exposing the key  p  ol liLets assume the users build a dependency on it by making some excel spreadsheets that use this key.  Could the key ever changeli liIf some records get lost in a database corruption or accident, and I want to avoid conflicts with old keys, couldnt I just adjust my starting point in NHibernate to skip the previously generated numbersli liWhat if the users want to change to some other methodology of identifying their records.  Lets say they want to start off with some meaningful character codes.  Could I not then, either show them a computed not stored identifier, or create a new alternate key column at any time that is based on my surrogate primary keyli ol  pIf someone can demonstrate a clear example of how exposing a managed surrogate primary key to user may become a problem down the road I will create an alternate key to present to the users, otherwise I will expose the surrogate primary key.p  pThanksp
Negative 6067 pHello all I have some very important system files which I want to protect from accidental deletion even by root user. I can create a new partition for that and mount it with readonly access but the problem is that I want my application which handles those system files to have write access to that part and be able to modify them. Is that possible using VFS As VFS handles access to the files I could have a module inserted in the VFS layer which can see if there is a write access to that part then see the authorization and allow it or otherwise reject it. If not please provide me suggestions regarding how can such a system be implemented what would I need in that case. If there exists a system like this please suggest about them also. I am using linux and want to implement this in C, I think it would be possible in C only.p  pEdit There are such kind of programs implemented in windows which can restrict access to administrator even, to some important folders, would that be possible in linux My application is a system backup and restore program which needs to keep its backup information safe and secure. So I would like to have a secured part of a partition which could not be accidently deleted in any way. There are methods of locking a flashdrive can we use some of those methods for locking a partition in linux also  so that mount is password protected  I am not writing a virus application, my application would give user option to delete the backups but I dont wanna allow them to be deleted by any other application.  Edit I am writing a system restore and backup program for ubuntu, I am a computer engineering student. p  pEdit As I have got opinion from Basile Starynkevitch that I would be committing worst sin of programming if I do anything like this, but you could provide me suggestions considering this as a experimental project, I could make some changes in the VFS layer so that this could work.p

Negative 6067 pI am creating a CCLI dll that will be loaded into a legacy c application. The legacy application does this with a traditional call to LoadLibrary. Both the application and the CCLI dll are compiled in 64 bit mode.p  pWhen the LoadLibrary call happens, it fails with error 193. This usually means that some non64bit component is trying to load. When I look at the dll load output in visual studio 2010, I see the the failure is occurring when mscoree.dll is being loaded to be exact, I see my dll loaded, then mscoree loaded, then mscoree unloaded, then my dll unloaded, then the error returned. Specifically CWindowsSystem32mscoree.dll is being loaded, when I examine this mscoree.dll, I find that it is targeting I386. p  pHow can I ensure that my application will link against the correct mscoree.dll I understand this could be done with a manifest, but I cant find any good information about setting one up. The ideal solution would allow compilation in 32bit or 64bit mode and target the correct mscoree.dll. p  pAs a side note, I found an mscoree.dll in a sidebyside folder that I verified is 64bit mode and copied it into my application directory with the hopes that it would pick up that one first. This didnt work and the CWindowsSystem32 version was still loaded.p  pThanks,p  pMaxp  h3Output of CorFlags.exe on the CCLI dllh3  precodeMicrosoft R .NET Framework CorFlags Conversion Tool.

Negative 6067 pI am currently trying to figure out why a shell script fails at concurrent logging every once in a while.p  pI have a shell function like the followingp  precodelog     local ltext1    local lfilepathtologsdate Ymdscript.log     local llinedate Ymd HMS hostname s ltext     echo lline gtgt lfile  codepre  pNow every once in a while this fails with a syntax errorp  precodepathtoscript.sh command substitution line 163 syntax error near unexpected token  pathtoscript.sh command substitution line 163 hostname s ltext codepre  pThe problem is, that I have multiple subprocesses, which each want to log as well as send traps during which logging is performed as well. I haved debugged the problem and found out, that this happens, when the function is entered three times simultaneously. First the codemaincode process enters, then the codechildcode. After the codedatecode part of codeltextcode is executed, codemaincode gets interrupted by a codetrapcode which is caused by codechildcode and in this codetrapcode tries to log something. The codechildcode and the codetrapcode finish their logging nicely, but then codemaincode is resumed after the trap and tries to execute the codehostnamecode part presumedly and fails with this error.p  pSo it seems like codemaincode does not like being put to sleep while it is producing the codedate Ymd HMS hostname s ltextcode part of the log statement and cannot resume nicely. I was assuming this should work fine, because I am just using local variables and thread safe output methods.p  pIs this a general concurrency problem I am running into here Or is this very specific for the trap mechanism in bash scripts I know about the commodities of SIGNAL handling in C, so I am aware that only certain operations are allowed in SIGNAL handlers. However I am not aware if the same precautions also apply when handling SIGNALs in a bash script. I tried to find documentation on this, but none of the documents I could find gave any indications of problems with SIGNAL handling in scripts.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere is an actuall simple script that can be used to replicate the problemp  precodebinbash  log    local textdate Ymd HMS hostname s 1   echo text gtgt devnull   subprocess    while true do     log Thread is running     kill ALRM      sleep 1   done   trap log received ALRM ALRM   subprocess amp subprocesspid trap kill subprocesspid exit 0 INT TERM   while true do   log Main is running   sleep 1 done codepre  pEvery once in a while this script will get killed because of a syntax error in line 5. Line 5 is codeecho text gtgt devnullcode, but since the syntax error also mentiones the hostname command, similar to the one I posted above, I am assuming there is an ofbyone error as well and the actual error is in line 4, which is codelocal textdate Ymd HMS hostname s 1code.p  pDoes anybody know what to do with the above script to correct it I alread tried moving out the construction of the string into some temporary variablesp  precodelog    local thedatedate Ymd HMS   local thehostnamehostname s   local textthedate thehostname 1   echo text gtgt devnull  codepre  pThis way the error appears less frequently, but it still is present, so this is not a real fix.p
Negative 6067 pIm building a game based on a framework that was illustrated in a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1430239875 relnofollowthis booka. From what I can tell, the framework is similar to other such frameworks that are geared towards making games, rather than other types of apps. Its proving quite helpful in most cases, but I dont fully understand how I would go about launching a traditional Activity. Specifically, I want to open up an Activity that contains a ScrollView, but am a bit lost on how this fits into the whole game framework paradigm... especially when it seems that gaming frameworks do rendering by updating a Canvas, rather than by dealing with individual Activity elements.p  pFor example, the framework way of launching a new screen look likep  precodegame.setScreennew HelpScreengame codepre  pwhere HelpScreen is a Java class that extends a Screen class. Id like to know the best practices way for opening a traditional Activity i.e. one that is laid out via an XML file. Or am I just going about this the wrong wayp  pThanks, Chrisp

Negative 6067 pI have a requirement where I need to add dropdown element to my report when exported to excel format.Dropdown has 2 values Yes or No. Once the report is generated user can view the dropdown and select yes or No from the dropdown list.

Negative 6067 pI followed the open graph object tutorial httpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsopengraphtutorial successfully and managed to post an open graph object on my timeline.p  pHowever, the post only appeared under the Recent Activities box which also includes other activities such as likes and became friendsp  pHow do I actually manage to make the post an individual post in its own feed box just like if I update my status there will be an individual post only for my status  I think it is possible because whenever I comment on pinterest, it manages to show an individual box for my comment action...p  pthanks in advancep
Negative 6067 pIn MySQL I am retrieving a codecolumntypecode from codeinformationschema.columnscode, and then want to produce a codeSELECTcode statement that codeCASTscode to the codecolumntypecode. However, both codeCASTcode and codeCONVERTcode seem to have their own ideas as to what a data type is. For example, Im often receiving codeVARCHAR64code, codeTEXTcode, and codeINT10 UNSIGNEDcode from the information schema, and want to essentially perform codeCONVERTTable.Column, INT10 UNSIGNEDcode but it says this is a syntax error. p  pI would need to write it as codeCONVERTTable.Column, UNSIGNEDcode, but in that case Im going to need to write code that parses every possible response for codecolumntypecode and convert it into a codeCASTcode equivalent, and even then it wont be guaranteed to produce the code I need What if Im taking a BIGINT and trying to stuff it into an INT Is there any way to perform a cast to the actual column types that are used to define tablesp
Negative 6067 pIm developing an application which I need to start to background services when the application is started.p  pInitially I added the startup procedure of the first service on the Application.onCreate method.p  pAfterward, I realize that I need to restart the service if for any reason the user stopped the background thread. Therefore I moved service startup code from the Application.onCreate to the main Activivity.onResume.p  pAccording to the documentation, calling startService on a already running service has no problem.p  pUntil then, everything was fine. My first background service was implemented just fine. When it starts, it creates a new thread to run the background processing without no major issue.p  pAfter implementing the first service, I moved to second one. No problems here. But after implementing it and added the service start call on the Activity.onResume method.p  precodeprivate void startServices      startTrackingService     startBacklogService   private void startTrackingService      if Z10.DEBUG          Log.iLOGTAG, REQUESTING TRACKING SERVICE START             Intent serviceLauncher  new IntentMain.this, TrackingService.class     startServiceserviceLauncher     if Z10.DEBUG          Log.iLOGTAG, TRACKING SERVICE START REQUESTED          private void startBacklogService      if Z10.DEBUG          Log.iLOGTAG, REQUESTING BACKLOG SERVICE START             Intent serviceLauncher  new IntentMain.this, BacklogService.class     startServiceserviceLauncher     if Z10.DEBUG          Log.iLOGTAG, BACKLOG SERVICE START REQUESTED         codepre  pThis code, blocks the main method and the application must be killed.p  pTrying to debug the application it is quite difficult without the android source code, I realized that the startService does not really start the service, it simply adds the operation on the Looper queue to be processed.p  pIf, I execute the two startService operation in sequence, the main thread blocks, but if after doing other stuff UIrelated on the main thread and just then start the second service, it works just fine.p  pThe problem is that I really would need to start both services on the application startup, or restart any of them on the Main activity resume.p

Negative 6067 pIve been researching this for a couple of days and Im seing a lot of answers to similar questions and they are unfortunately all No, you cant do that. So, perhaps you can help me find a more efficient way or perhaps you have a better answer.p  pIm running a game at an event. When users sign up for my game, theyll authorize my Facebook app. They get points in my game for doing certain things. One of the things they get points for is Liking a chosen Facebook page. p  pThey dont Like the page through any interface I control though, so Im going to be running a process in the background which checks if my authorized users have liked the page. p  pIm going to have tens of thousands of people playing this game though. Ive got an accesstoken for each of them and I know I can fetch a list of likes for Person X with their accesstoken, but fetching 10,000 lists of likes to check if theyve liked the page seems ridiculous... especially since if they havent liked it, I cant just cross them off the list. I need to keep checking every few minutes for the duration of the event just to see if they have liked the page yet and give them points. Once they have liked the page then I no longer need to keep checking them, but thats still going to require a ton of requests.p  pIs there a way that I can determine which of my 10k users, for whom I have individual accesstokens, have liked my page p  pOr can I get list of people who have recently liked a particular pagep  pAny other suggestionsp  pEDIT As the administrator of my FB page, I can use the website to just click through and I can see all of the people who have liked my page, so I feel like there should be some way to access this information programmatically as well.

However, I noticed that the JavaScript was essentially taking the contents of an codeacodes codehrefcode attribute and placing it in an codeimgcodes codesrccode attribute when the lightbox was open. As far as I can see, changing this codeimgcode to an codeiframecode done and setting the anchor tags codehrefcode to codeyoutube.comembedvideoidcode should generate an codeiframecode containing that YouTube video replacing codewatchidcode with codeembedcode presents a full screen version of the video.p  pI then also added JavaScript for width, height and frameborder attributes on top of the default codeclasslbimagecode. Now when the page is loaded and the Lightbox called it creates an empty window. If you inspect the code you can see all the attributes are there but the page in the frame frame isnt loaded, just creating an empty codeheadcode and codebodycode tag.p  pI was just wondering if it was a server problem or a code problem and if so, how to fix it. If there any way to make it workp  pThanksp  pstrongNote Im NOT using Drupal so the codelightvideocode option is not available.strongp

Negative 6067 pIm having problems when trying to strongdirectlystrong without any dialog print a PDF on a Java Web application on a Websphere Application Server 6.1 and a Java program both share some code which include this printing code with a printer. The printer is on a Windows host, and the web application and the non web application are run on Linux.p  pI have read that it could be a permission problem, as I would be trying to print with a user in Linux that either doesnt exist on the printing system Windows or doesnt have persmissions. p  pThe server and the Java application are run with user root, so Im stuck here if its a permission problem as I was told by the client that the user with permissions on the printing server is another one. I know the username that is allowed to print on that server.p  pI think it could do it if its possible to associate Linuxs root user with the user on Windows which has permissions to print through Samba. But I havent been able to do it Im quite noob in Samba knowledge. Even if I could do this, Im not sure that it would allow the code to lookup the printer in the Windows machine. I didnt find any method to autheticate or connecting to a server either.p  pFor further information, I use the class javax.print.PrintServiceLookup in order to looking the printer up, that doesnt seem to have a method to allow me to authenticate on a server or something similar.

Negative 6067 pPart of my form for user accounts asks people for their intereststags which are stored in MySQL with each tag separated with a comma.p  pEach tag is given an id and then a separate table links the users unique id with the tag id. p  pThis all works great  absolutely ideal BUT I would like to not duplicate tags thousands of times. For example, a lot of people will type gym as an interest. It seems a waste to keep adding a new gym tag with a unique id, whereas once its been entered as a tag once, that tag id can then be associated with any new user id who happens to also type in gym. Does that make sensep  pMy current code is below tags coming from a sanitised POST, and is inseretd into two tablesp  p1.tagid which has a tag field for the tag, each generating a unique id 2.tagrelation which matches the user id to the generated tag id.p  precodetags  strtouppertagstags pregsplit,, tags foreach tags as ind    sql  INSERT INTO tagid tag VALUESind resultmysqlquerysql   foreach tags as ids   sql  SELECT  FROM tagid WHERE tag  ids resultmysqlquerysql idinfomysqlfetchassocresult ididinfo[tid]  sql  INSERT INTO tagrelation userid, tagid VALUES userid, id resultmysqlquerysql  codepre  pSo my question is, can the above be modified to not duplicate tags in the tagid table, but match existing tags from that table with the user id in tagrelationp

Negative 6067 pIm trying to put together a crossplatform application that interfaces with Insteon automation hardware. In the .Net based examples Ive found, the System.IO.Ports.SerialPort class is used to read data from both an RS232 Serial Port based device and a USB Serial Modem. On a Windows platform, the Serial Modems generally get mapped to a virtual COM Port and its not to difficult to run down a list, passing in new COM addresses and attempting to figure out which one the USB or Serial device is attached to.p  pUnfortunately on the Mac, Im totally out of my element. MonoMac allows me to program in a more comfortable language, but something as low level as talking to hardware is a bit beyond my reach.

After some searching, I discovered that a usb device would likely register as devtty.usbserial, but Im wondering if theres a more elegant way if detecting what this value is that I can leverage in Mono rather than instructing a user to go into Terminal and type ls devtty. and type it themselvesp

Negative 6067 pContext Im working on an analytics system for an ordering system. There are about 100,000 orders per day and the analytics need to run for the last N say, 100 days months. The relevant data fits in memory. After N days, all orders are evicted from the memory cache,  with an entire day in the past being evicted. Orders can be created or updated.p  ol lipA traditional approach would use a codeConcurrentHashMapltDate, QueueltOrdergtgtcode. Every day, values for keys representing dates more than N days in the past will be deleted. But, of course, the whole point of using Guava is to avoid this. EDIT changed codeMapcode to codeConcurrentHashMapcode, see the end of the question for rationale.pli lipWith Guava collections, a codeMultiMap ltDate, Ordergtcode would be simpler. Eviction is similar, implemented explicitly.pli lipWhile the codeCachecode implementation looks appealing after all, I am implementing a Cache, Im not sure about the eviction options. Eviction only happens once a day and its best initiated from outside the cache, I dont want the cache to have to check the age of an order. Im not even sure if the cache would use a MultiMap, which I think its a suitable data structure in this case.pli ol  pThus, my question is is it possible to use a Cache that uses and exposes the semantics of a MultiMap and allows evictions controlled from outside itself, in particular with the rule I need delete all orders older than N days p  pAs an important clarification, Im not interested in a codeLoadingCachecode but I do need bulk loads if the application needs to be restarted, the cache has to be populated, from the database, with the last N days of orders.p  pEDIT Forgot to mention that the map emneeds to be concurrentem, as orders come in they are evaluated live against the previous orders for the same customer or location etc.  p  pEDIT2 Just stumbled over a hrefhttpcode.google.compguavalibrariesissuesdetailid135 relnofollowGuava issue 135a. It looks like the MultiMap is not concurrent.p

Negative 6067 pBeing primarily an iOS developer, I am curious about how to tackle a current OS X project that I am working on.

Negative 6067 pI have a .NET solution that has, lets say, 10 projects within it.p  pThere are a couple ways of thinkingp  ol liUse a Git repository per project, then use a repository for the solution and submodules. So, each code.csprojcode file and dependent file gets its own repository.li liUse a single Git repository for the entire solution. Everything the code.slncode file depends upon.li ol  pLooking at option 1, I think would be tough as if you are working on a feature branch, you have to create a feature branch for every referenced submodule. It creates a lot of overhead.p  pOption 2 seems easier to deal with branching, however, with a large number of developers on a project, you may run into quite a bit of merge conflicts, especially when dealing with the code.csprojcode files.p  pHow do other .NET developers manager their Git repositories with their various solutions.p

This works fine. Now I have two questionsp  p1 is it possible to hide the progressbar initially I know I can put displaynone in the css and let it show up when the button is clicked.

Negative 6067 pI am creating an app with an codeUIViewControllercode which displays other codeUIViewControllerscode with the codeMPFlipTransitioncode inside it. Its like a little book on iPad. The codeUIViewControllerscode inside are created each with xibs with 45 codeUIImageViewscode inside and some of those images are animated with CoreAnimations code[UIView animateWithDuration]code blocks I remove all the animations in the codeviewDidDiseappearcode function with the QuartzCore function removeAllAnimation on each animated layer. But when Im testing the app on an iPad 3, it works properly, but on iPad 2 it crashes at about the 8th page change. Ive made a profiling with Instruments and found that the real memory usage was increasing everytime I turned the page when the codeMPFlipTransitioncode appears. But even if I remove from the superview the previous views, the real memory usage is not decreasing. I thinks that it created the crash on the iPad 2 because the crash come when the real memory usage is passing the 400 Mbytes value and the iPad 2 has only 512MB....p  pWhat do you think about this problem  Any help  Im using ARC for memory management...

Negative 6067 pIm looking for a Docking library for using in the C application. It can be designed for WPF, but I prefer WinForms applications. Of course, it should provide standart docking opportunities.br Im going to use it in an application where user can control a huge amount of different processes which can appear and disappear dynamically during the application lifetime. Thus, the main criteria is the following I should have opportunity to create docking windows and controls located on it dynamically and save the information about all docking windows positions in some file content I can save using other way. After the application was relaunched it should restore all the docking windows in their states before the application close and all of their content, but I can load it manually.br Unfortunately, I have found the only docking components library that contains all the required features  its Telerik WinControls. But its too slow for my purposes.p  pPlease advise me a good docking libraryp
Negative 6067 pIm trying to be proactive around security on my Jetty webserver boxes  especial with regards to storing SSL key information although Id like a generic solution.

Negative 6067 pI would like to know how one goes about designing an application that can be played on Facebook, as well as downloaded from the App Store as a standalone app, but allows games to be played between both platforms. There are games out there like EA sports NFL social game. You can download the game and play others across multiple platforms, including Facebook.p  pWhat I do understand is that all the resources of the application are downloaded to the client device unless playing through a browser, such as Facebook. What I do not understand is how they have created a cross platform game using html for one platform, and an independent nonhtml sandbox application for another, and have both games interact as though they were one.p  pAlso, Would I run a cgi script on my website that creates an executable program that handles the game logic to communicate between both models of the gamep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 6067 pI would like to have a TextView in my Android App be set to another TextView in the same class randomly. I tried thisp  precodesuper.onCreatesavedInstanceState setContentViewR.layout.activitymain pop  TextView findViewByIdR.id.popUSA poprank  TextViewfindViewByIdR.id.poprankUSA randomUSA  TextView findViewByIdR.id.randomUSA Random randomStat  new Random int random  randomStat.nextInt2  if random  1 randomUSA.setTextpop  if random  2 randomUSA.setTextpoprank              codepre  pAnd it didnt work. It would show me some random text instead and wasnt changing when I reopened the app. Also, could someone tell me how to make a button that refreshes the TextView and sets it as a different random one.

Negative 6067 pIm currently working with ASP Dynamic Data for the first time and Im trying to build a filter.

Negative 6067 pI have a problem with these two classes, when the size of the file to send  receive exceeds 1GB.The class Decripter waits for something, before closing the stream to the output file, which appears to have been received in full by controlling the size. Cripter class instead finishes successfully without any errors. Since the size of the complete file too big, I can not use debugging.

Negative 6067 pIve been trying all day to write an ultra basic Android app that when given a string, readssearches the word column of a sqlite3 database file I generated from CMUDicts 133000 word dictionary, in the example below I search for the code column entry corresponding to the row that Hello is in in the word column  and outputs to logcat the corresponding entry.  I know I have some methods to set values in the database but my goal is to simply search the database I already have together.p  pIn the terminal, I can do p  precodekizzlebot sqlite3 cmudict.0.7a.sqlite3 codepre  precode SELECT code FROM cmudict WHERE wordHELLOcodepre  pto search the database. It returns the correct value.p  pBut when I run my program, it just immediately crashes.  And logcat says I have a cursorIndexOutofBounds error. I have no idea what I am doing wrong since Im not too good with reading the logcat output.  p  pIve placed cmudict.0.7a.sqlite3 in the assets directory located on the same level as AndroidManifest.xml.  Im not quite positive if there are other declarations I need to make in any xml files that has to refer to the sqlite3 file.

I can also define codeApp.FoobarViewcode and codeApp.FoobarControllercode and Ember knows that they go together and pairs them up automatically. That said, I would expect the same type of magic to happen for AJAX requests for codeUserModelcode to be rewritten to codeuserscode and to enable fetching via codeApp.store.find User, 123 code.p  pIs there a reason this convention has been broken when dealing with models, or is this just an oversighterrorinconsistency with EmberDatap
Negative 6067 pI am fixing a bug for a tooltip in a Kendo UI chart.

Negative 6067 pI have a list of items lets say  1  2  3  4  5  I want to take 1 and compare it to the rest of the list, but I do not wish for 1 to compare to itself. After 1 has compared to the rest of the list I think want to pop 1 back into the list and then take 2 out and compare to the rest of list this time including 1. This is what I have tried. The problem here is when I iterate the first time through it works perfect because the first iterate starts at 0 and compares starting at 1, but then once it loops past the 0 index it will start comparing against it self causing problems.

Negative 6067 pSimilar points to the one in this question have been raised before a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq131439596781herea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq979141596781herea, and Im aware of the Google coredump library which Ive appraised and found lacking, though I might try and work on that if I understand the problem better.p  pI want to obtain a core dump of a running Linux process without interrupting the process. The natural approach is to sayp  precodeif fork  abort  codepre  pSince the forked process gets a fixed snapshot copy of the original processs memory, I should get a complete core dump, and since the copy uses copyonwrite, it should generally be cheap. However, a critical shortcoming of this approach is that codeforkcode only forks the current thread, and all other threads of the original process wont exist in the forked copy.p  pMy question is whether it is possible to somehow obtain the relevant data of the other, original threads. Im not entirely sure how to approach this problem, but here are a couple of subquestions Ive come up withp  ol lipIs the memory that contains all of the threads stacks still available and accessible in the forked processpli lipIs it possible to quicky enumerate all the running threads in the original process and store the addresses of the bases of their stacks As I understand it, the base of a thread stack on Linux contains a pointer to the kernels thread bookkeeping data, so...pli lipwith the stored thread base addresses, could you read out the relevant data for each of the original threads in the forked processpli ol  pIf that is possible, perhaps it would only be a matter of appending the data of the other threads to the core dump. However, if that data is lost at the point of the fork already, then there doesnt seem to be any hope for this approach.p

Negative 6067 pIm having the same problem as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13413036googledriveapiphpclientlibrarysettinguploadtypetoresumableuploadthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13808528uploadlargefiletogoogledrivewithphpclientlibrarylq1thisa but in the Java domain. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15499334howtospecifyuploadtypeforinsertfunctioningoogledrivesdkjavaclientThisa question also covers what I want but since no answers have been forthcoming I thought Id ask it here, with a little more detail.p  pIm most of the way through writing a Java application to back up files to Google Drive. As others have found, internal server error 500 failures are a pretty common problem with uploads, but for small files, implementing the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdrivemanageuploadsexpbackoff relnofollowrecommended exponential backoff and retrya works okay. For large files, however, anything over a few MB the failure rate is unacceptably high. In some cases Im getting well over 50 failure rate, which makes any long backup job effectively impossible.p  pWhen inserting uploading a file using the Google Drive v2 API, a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdrivemanageuploads relnofollowthe documentation clearly statesa that three upload types are available simple, multipart and resumable. The upload type is specified by adding a parameter to the endpoint URL. Clearly, what Im after is the resumable upload type.p  h2The problemh2  pThere appears to be no method to set this uploadType parameter using the API. Theres a method call to set every optional parameter as detailed a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdrivev2referencefilesinsert relnofollowherea, but not a sniff of a way to set uploadType to resumable. No code snippets, no documentation, no nothing.p  pSomewhat confusingly, there is also what appears to be an unrelated chunked media upload mode, which is the default and which Ive actually disabled in my application by calling coderequest.getMediaHttpUploader.setDirectUploadEnabledtruecode, since it appears to make no difference whatsoever to the reliability of an upload, no matter what the chunksize is set to, and it hugely slows uploads down.p  pIm on the verge of circumventing the API and building the requests manually, but Id really like to know if anyone else has encounteredsolved this first. Its such a glaring omission that I cant believe lots of folk havent encountered it before.p  pCheers all.p  pDavid.p

Negative 6067 pFirst of all thanks for everybody who might be able to help me further on the following problem.p  pI am sending some text to several devices on serial port. Due to the already existing interface, I have to use DataReceived event to read the responses from the serial ports. There are devices that do not respond at all, so I need a timeout for waiting for the response.p  pSo for a single device, I create an instance of SerialPort, add a handler to its DataReceived event and send my text and start a timer. Timer callback runs its own thread and I would like to run the DataReceived handler also in seperate thread.p  pWhen response comes before timer ticks, the timer needs to be stopped. When timer ticks before response comes, the late response should not be handled. So there are some shared data between timer and handler threads. How do I further go about synchronizing these two threadp  pI also have to mention that I need to handle several devices simultaneously, that makes the threading situation even more complicated.p  pSo far my code for handling a single device looks like this.

Negative 6067 pThis is a mysteryp  pIm invoking codesetPrimitiveValueforKeycode on an codeNSManagedObjectcode. The key is a legit, persistent, modeled attribute of the object. However, setPrimitiveValueforKey fails, often setting the value for a emdifferentem, arbitrary attribute.  The docs say this behavior is expected when invoking codesetPrimitiveValueforKeycode for an unmodeled key. So it seems Core Data thinks the key is unmodeled.p  pThe strange partp  pWhen the key is hardcoded as a string literal, the primitive value is indeed set successfully. It only fails when the key is a variable. The variable Im using happens to be passed from the codekeyPathcode argument of codeobserveValueForKeyPathofObjectchangecontextcodep  pThe codekeyPathcode variable is the same as the string literal. codeisEqualcode returns true and the hash values are equal. The codekeyPathcode variable is of type codeNSCFStringcode.

Negative 6067 pSo Ive asked this before but with significantly less detail. The question title accurately describes the problem I have a method in C that I am trying to call from assembly x86 that has both parameters and a return value. I have a rough understanding, at best, of assembly and a fairly solid understanding of C otherwise I would not have undertaken this problem. Heres what I have as far as code goesp  precode methodAddr is a pointer to the method address void methodAddr  methodgtAddress   buffer is an int array of parameter values. The parameters can be anything of any type  but are copied into an int array so they can be pushed onto the stack in reverse order  4 bytes at a time as in push int. I know theres an issue here that is irrelevent to my baseline testing, in that if any parameter is over 4 bytes it will be broken and  reversed which is not good but for basic testing this isnt an issue, so overlook this. for int index  bufferElementCount  1 index gt 0 index      int val  buffer[index]      asm              push val        int returnValueCount  0   if there is a return value, allocate some space for it and push that onto the stack after  the parameters have been pushed on if methodgtHasReturnValue      returnSize  methodgtReturnValueSize     outVal  new char[returnSize]     returnValueCount  returnSize  4  returnSize  4  0  1  0     memsetoutVal, 0, returnSize      for int index  returnValueCount  1 index gt 0 index              char addr  charoutVal  index  4          asm                      push addr                  calculate the stack pointer offset so after the call we can pop the parameters and return value int espOffset  bufferElementCount  returnValueCount  4   call the method asm      call methodAddr     add esp, espOffset  codepre  pFor my basic testing I am using a method with the following signaturep  precodePerson MyMethod3 int, char, int  codepre  pThe problem is this when omit the return value from the method signature, all of the parameter values are properly passed. But when I leave the method as is, the parameter data that is passed is incorrect but the value returned is correct. So my question, obviously, is what is wrong Ive tried pushing the return value space onto the stack before the parameters. The person structure is as followsp  precodeclass Person  public     Text Name     int Age     float Cash     ICollectionltPersongt Friends  codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Then create the output register. Then put the parameters in a particular register the order here happens to be codeeaxcode, codeecxcode, and codeedxcode, which makes sense codeeaxcode and codeebxcode are for one, codeecxcode is for two, and codeedxcode and some other register for the last parameter. Then call codeLEAcode loadeffective address which I dont understand but have understood to be a codeMOVcode. Then it calls the method with an address as the parameter And then moves the stack pointer to pop the parameters and return value.p  pAny further explanation is appreciated, as Im sure my understanding here is somewhat flawed.p

Negative 6067 pIm a newbie in FFT and I was asked to find a way to analyseprocess a particular set of data collected by oil drilling rigs. There is a lot of noise in the collected data due to rig movements up amp down with tides and waves for example. I was asked to clean the collected data up with FFTfilteringIFFT. p  pI use C and the FFTW 3.3.3 library.p  pAn example is better than anything else so p  pI have a DB with, for example, the mudflow liters per minutes. The mudflow is collected every 5 seconds, there is a timestamp in the DB for every measure ex. 1387411235.p  pSo my INdata for my FFT is a couple of timestampmudflow ex. 13874566303955.94, 13874566353954.92, etc...p  pDisplaying theses data really looks like a noisy sound signal and relevant events may be masked by the noise.p  pUsing examples found on the Internet I can manage to perform FFT but my lack of knowledge and understanding is a big problem as Ive never worked on signal processing and Fourier Transforms.p  pI dont really know how to proceed to start with this job, which version of FFTW routine to use c2c, r2c, etc..., if there is any predataprocessing andor postprocessing to do. There are a lot of examples and tutorials that Ive read on the internet but Im french sorry for my mistakes here and it doesnt always make sense to me especially with OUTdata units, OUTdata type, In and Out data array size, windowing what is that by the way, to put it in a nutshell Im lost...p  pI suppose that my problem would be pretty straightforward for someone used to FFTW but for me its very complicated right now.p  pSo my questions  p  ul liWhat FFTW routine to use in both ways FFT amp IFFT what kind, type and size, of array for INdata and OUTdata.li liHow to interpret the resulting array what are the units that FFTW will return.li ul  pFor now a short sample of what Ive done is p  precodefftwplan p p   fftwplanfftwplandft1dsize,in,out,FFTWFORWARD,FFTWESTIMATE fftwexecutep fftwdestroyplanp codepre  pwith in and out as fftwcomplex the complex element of my Indata array is set to 1 for every data, dont really know why but the tutorial said to do that.p  pThis code is based on an example found on the Internet but my lack of knowledgeunderstanding is a big drag and I was wondering if there was someone here who could give me explanationsworkflowinsightslinks on how to pull this out. p  pIm in a trial period for my new job and I really want to implement this feature for my boss even if it means asking around for help, Ive seen a lot of FFTW skilled posts here...p

Negative 6067 pI am currently making a painting application and am currently implementing the rubber tool. Due to the reason that the canvas JPanel I am using has a transparent background intended, I could not just call g2d.fillOvalx,y,x,y as it would draw a transparent circle, thus the drawing that was there before would remain. Conscquently, I have decided to use WritableRaster and its setPixel method in two for loops that shape the overall shape that the pixels draw into a circle r is the same on every tangent. Yet, I am having problem with calling the setPixel method, as it does not draw anything. I have even set the color to black just to test it, and nothing.

Negative 6067 pIm sure this is fairly simple, but Ive been struggling with the best way to implement this effect in SpriteKit.  I have a laser node which I want to turn off and on every x  of seconds.  Ive tried setting up SKActions to turn off sound and fade image out, but Im not sure how to have the node be aware of weather it is current off or on in the SKAction.  I guess what I am looking for is some type of callback when each SKAction in my runAction completes.  That way I could set a flag to say of the laser is on or off and use that when a collision occurs so I know how to handle it.  Im not sure if this is best way to go about this either.  Thanks for your help.p

Negative 6067 pFor better reflow handling, it is said that strongunused CSS rulesstrong should be avoided, because the browser spends time trying to find match all these rules. But, in real life, we have websites with many pages, and popups and what not, and its also a bestpractice to use as few HTTP requests as possible, and in most cases its best to create a strongsingle CSS filestrong that includes everything, and that file will be cached. So, these two performance bestpractice approaches seems to collide with each other, because, by creating a single file, it will be filled with rules which arent in use most of the time per page, and by splitting it up to many stylesheet files and only uses the ones the page or components need will cause many HTTP requests to be fired and might also be difficult to manage. p  pSo, what is best is reducing reflow is better than less HTTP requestsp  pemsome links on the matterembr a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comspeeddocsbestpracticespayloadRemoveUnusedCSS relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comspeeddocsbestpracticespayloadRemoveUnusedCSSa a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebGuideCSSWritingefficientCSS relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebGuideCSSWritingefficientCSSap

Any ideas  Thanks.p  precodeltHTMLgt ltHEADgt  ltscriptgt     document.readyfunction       region map     regions area         .livemouseover, function             imgthis.attrforReg.show             return false                  .livemouseout, function             imgthis.attrforReg.hide             return false               ltscriptgt ltHEADgt ltBODYgt     ltdiv styleposition absolute height 608px width 1225px backgroundimage urlbackground.jpggt             ltdiv styleposition absolute height 608px width 1225px backgroundimage urlslovensko.pnggt                 ltimg idbratislava styleposition absolute left 0px top 307px display none srcbratislava.pnggt                 ltimg idtrnava styleposition absolute left 25px top 232px display none srctrnava.pnggt                 ltimg idtrencin styleposition absolute left 119px top 95px display none srctrencin.pnggt                 ltimg idnitra styleposition absolute left 184px top 290px display none srcnitra.pnggt                 ltimg idzilina styleposition absolute left 336px top 0px display none srczilina.pnggt                 ltimg idbystrica styleposition absolute left 357px top 219px display none srcbystrica.pnggt                 ltimg idpresov styleposition absolute left 658px top 47px display none srcpresov.pnggt                 ltimg idkosice styleposition absolute left 725px top 196px display none srckosice.pnggt                 ltimg usemapregions styleposition absolute srcnazvykrajov.png width1225 height608 altgt                 ltmap nameregionsgt                     ltarea forRegbratislava shapepoly coords48,197,90,199,104,171,144,156,135,95,106,55,102,31,121,13,110,0,78,28,48,26,9,52,5,92,29,150 hrefbratislava.htmlgt                     ltarea forRegtrnava shapepoly coords110,166,121,227,59,278,158,365,202,310,200,265,184,262,185,232,207,217,201,173,221,133,199,119,209,98,225,92,169,63,128,79,116,56,124,46,60,0,13,52,2,108,39,102,66,103,88,75,96,90,76,107,82,128 hreftrnava.htmlgt                     ltarea forRegtrencin shapepoly coords141,199,209,268,313,189,284,148,290,119,240,120,271,91,219,0,174,10,154,94,123,95,113,126,1,171,35,222,76,206,137,229 hreftrencin.htmlgt                     ltarea forRegnitra shapepoly coords2,311,217,310,246,222,282,218,299,170,247,177,247,150,255,137,230,98,183,128,194,101,173,54,142,71,119,46,127,33,74,0,72,27,38,56,59,81,35,131,39,166,18,182,22,211,41,219,39,257 hrefnitra.htmlgt                     ltarea forRegzilina shapepoly coords135,275,139,235,267,218,352,227,354,162,298,125,301,64,271,64,234,0,191,26,173,62,129,66,127,32,39,31,0,98,44,159,46,189,15,212,71,213,67,248,98,278 hrefzilina.htmlgt                     ltarea forRegbystrica shapepoly coords215,278,223,243,247,232,312,265,387,221,427,157,392,149,403,113,368,64,380,22,270,11,248,1,198,4,180,20,117,22,112,60,71,63,24,120,1,124,20,193,56,172,78,211,66,249,94,256,121,241,113,287,174,281 hrefbystrica.htmlgt                     ltarea forRegpresov shapepoly coords118,156,173,167,198,158,240,170,243,182,295,192,292,206,303,211,324,188,343,189,361,217,409,219,409,179,447,193,482,192,479,180,495,167,506,186,533,188,566,115,458,71,446,36,356,2,339,12,292,2,280,17,265,6,242,13,253,29,222,52,177,14,147,29,127,16,97,24,94,38,67,41,44,94,17,73,2,93,5,113,35,121,30,169,33,188,89,195,95,168 hrefpresov.htmlgt                     ltarea forRegkosice shapepoly coords137,142,205,165,274,139,338,213,420,197,425,127,466,86,466,40,440,36,430,17,409,43,379,47,370,31,339,32,343,62,315,76,270,35,253,36,236,61,217,36,123,3,122,13,99,18,62,3,22,22,31,33,0,73,35,141,22,175,67,178,75,158 hrefkosice.htmlgt                 ltmapgt             ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltBODYgt ltHTMLgt codepre

Negative 6067 pIdeally, a stringtodouble method would always yield the codedoublecode whose value was closest to the exact numerical value of the specified string for example, since 102030405060708072.99 is only 7.01 away from the next larger value, but 8.99 away from the next smaller value, it should round to the next higher value.  Neither codeConvert.ToDoublecode nor codeString.Parsecode seems to work that way, however both cause that value to be rounded down.p  pIt appears that the behavior is to ignore everything past the eighteenth digit, even if values beyond that cold affect how things are rounded.  Is there anything that emspecifiesem such behavior  Is there anything that specifies that every decimal representation of 18 digits or fewer will always be mapped to codedoublecode value which is no more than half an LSB away from the precise represented value, notwithstanding the fact that numbers of 18 digits or more may be mapped to a value which is nearly 916 of an LSB away from the indicated valuep  pBased upon a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24299692whyisaroundtripconversionviaastringnotsafeforadoubleWhy is a roundtrip conversion via a string not safe for a doublea it would appear that the behavior of conversion routines may vary between platforms.  To what extent is such behavior a deviation from spec, and to what extent does the spec leave such behaviors open  Is there anything in any specification which would indicate that adding a code0code to the end of the fractional part of a formatted codedoublecode will not affect the result of parsingp  pMy own expectation would be that floatingpoint methods should specify the degree of accuracy they promise.  In the absence of any specification to the contrary, I would expect floatingpoint methods to yield a result which would be within 12lsb of the arithmeticallyprecise result that would be yielded with some combination of numeric operands that were within 12lsb of the values passed, since that level of accuracy can often be achieved for about the same cost as anything sloppier, but accuracy beyond that is often much more expensive.  If a method is going to take extra time to achieve better accuracy, it should specify that to encourage code that needs to be fast, but doesnt need the full precision, to consider a faster n alternative.  Code should not require for correctness that a method it uses be more accurate than that unless the method promises better accuracy.p  pThe codeRcode formatting option for codedoublecode values in .NET is supposed to yield a value which, when parsed, will match the original operand, but does not specify what method of parsing should be used to achieve that result.  If one wants to convert floatingpoint values to strings in such a way as to guarantee systemindependent roundtripability, what must one do to ensure that any legitimate implementation of a parsing method will parse it the same wayp

Negative 6067 pI am currently developing a web app that makes constant ajax calls polls to php to pull new tasks from the database, sort of like how gmailfacebook checks for new email and messages.

I know facebook and google do this by changing the Tab Heading from Facebook to Something Like Facebook2 indicating 2 new messages. This seems like the norm, as Ive seen other websites do this yahoo, trello, etc. This is sufficient for what I need to do and I was wondering if anyone knew how to do this, specifically only notify when the user is in a different tab. I can guarantee that the user will only use the app in Chrome, so any tool that Chrome supports will be fine. p

Negative 6067 pFirst of all, let me apologize for the supernoob question about WPF and binding. I have started, a few days ago, to get interested in WPF and its implementation with XAML markup and C codebehind in Visual Studio Express 2013, and Im trying to bind the contents of a button to a property that is part of a singleton class. And I cant, apparently.p  pWhat I want to do is this I have a button saying Start and I want, on click, to have the button contents change to a timer  stop, something like 000002  Stop and, on click again, to have it change back to Start.p  pI have this class that I have designed as a singleton to prevent it from being instantiated more than once, which contains an instance codestopwatchcode of codeSystem.Diagnostics.Stopwatchcode, and a string property which I change either to codeStartcode or codestopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds.ToString   Stopcode back and forth.p  pThe problem is that when I try to refer to my singleton class in the XAML markup, like so to be honest, I dont really know what Im doing, Im just inspiring myself from diverse examples Ive found over the webp  precodeltWindow     ...     xmlnslocalclrnamespacemyNameSpacegt      ltGridgt         ltlocalmySingleton xKeymyStringProperty gt         ...     ltGridgt ltWindowgt codepre  pI get a slew of compiler errors 6 total of which some say The type mySingleton does not include any accessible constructors. and The Key attribute can only be used on an element that is contained in IDictionary.p  pIm clueless as to what to do, knowing that I dont want to make the constructor public and therefore get rid of the singleton thing.p  pAny pointers towards the right direction p  pThank you guys for your help.p

But none working with stronggetstrong. p  pI dont know if I am wrong, but seems useless the stronggetstrong method if we are working with codescheduleWithFixedDelaycode, because if I use laterp  ul lischeduledFuture.get  it remains awaiting and the Runnable object remains working many times run,complete,delay,run,etc... li lischeduledFuture.get32, TimeUnit.SECONDS  always appears TimeoutException li ul  pI thought I should be able to retrieve the null value since I can use the codeperiodcode argumentparameter from the codescheduleWithFixedDelaycode method. strongI meanstrong run the Runnable object, wait until it completes and use the scheduledFuture.get to get the null value that confirms it has been completed, await the period of the delay time to run again the Runnable object according with the codeperiodcode value etc....p  pClarifications and examples are totally well welcomep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 6067 pToday I was trying to figure out how to send data from my PHP file on my host to a VPS server.

The server in vb.net or c will listen for connections on a certain port. The problem is, I do not know how to initiate the request to the VPS in PHP.

Negative 6067 pI am developing an application C which calculates the cost of a complex system. This system consists of many parts and subparts and each part may have different calculation algorithms. Initially, I planned to create a set of classes containing only properties as a representation of system parts. In addition to these classes I would create a set of dedicated cost calculators. It would resemble procedural programming and anemic domain model antipattern. So I thought of another way implementing costcalculating logic inside those partentities.

Negative 6067 pI wish to know if there is a way to implement multiple infoWindows on Google Maps for iOS. I know I can get an image from the UIView and use it as an icon for the GMSMarker, but its very hard to achieve the same look and feel as a regular infoWindow. Id greatly appreciate any pointers in this regard. Currently, I am looping through the markers and displaying the infoWindows based on a timer using the setSelectedMarker method. But it only allows one infoWindow to be selected at a time. Is anyone aware of any custom InfoWindows which can be displayed simultaneously.p

Negative 6067 pWe have a few html pages in one of our solutions that are meant to be extremely simple, client side only, pure htmljavascript pages that access our web api. The api itself is in a web application project in the same solution.p  pWe are now using a web site project to contain those files, but it is getting harder and harder to manage that project, since its information is placed on the solution, and most of its aspects cannot be controlled like they can on a msbuild project file.p  pId like to migrate those html files to a web application project, but Im struggling to make it as basic as possible. For instance, I do not want to generate any dlls on the project. It should be in the solution just to provide access to the files and to enable us to control what goes to the codePublishedWebsitescode folder on the build by setting the build action on the files. We need this because there are some miscellaneous files in the project that should not be published.p  pI tried creating an empty web application and removing most things from it, by editing the csproj file. I managed to delete all references and the whole codePropertiescode special folder along with the AssemblyInfo.cs file, but when I run the codebuildcode command, I still see a dll created along with the codeobjcode and codebincode folders. Then, I tried faking the build target on the csproj file, like thisp  precodeltTarget NameBuild gt codepre  pNow when the project is built, no dllpdb is created, but the obj and bin folders are still there. Next, I tried setting the outputpath property to the current directory, like thisp  precodeltOutputPathgt.ltOutputPathgt codepre  pBut even then, the obj folder is still created.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI just found another a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb629394.aspx relnofollowcommon msbuild propertya that controls where the files inside the obj folder are placed. After placing this in my csproj filep  precodeltIntermediateOutputPathgt.ltIntermediateOutputPathgt codepre  pI now get no folders generated on build, which is nice. p  pThere is a small problem now though and Im not sure how and where exactly this process happens when I open the solution or reload the project in Visual Studio. Even though the project is not being built at this time, some files are still generatedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBS9SG.png altAutogenerated files on loadp  pI feel the current approach is enough for my requirements, yet Id really like to know if there is a more elegant way to achieve that. Thus, the question holds Is there a way to make the web application project work as if there was no code file in it, effectively disabling output generation bin and obj folders, and the dllxmlpdb outputsp

Negative 6067 pWe are implementing currency convention. Some of our clients operate in many countries and some of the orders are placed in the base currency of the company and will not need conversion and some are placed in other countries and will need conversion. We have a currencyrate in the orders table and if the rate is NULL then no conversion is needed and if a rate is there we multiply the order total by the rate for the conversion. My question is  I do not think INSULL will do the trick.p  precodeSELECT SumISNULLordertotal,0  ISNULLcurrencyrate,1 AS [Total]  FROM   orders codepre  pThe ordertotal is always stored in the db as the base currency of the company and only converted when needed for display purposes. Some engineers here are worried that this may work on the aggregate and not the row level.p

Negative 6067 pI have twice now seen a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode logged from a Production ASP.NET MVC 4 web application  and logged on the wrong line. Not wrong by a line or two like you would get with a PDB mismatch, but wrong by the length of the entire controller action. Examplep  precodepublic ActionResult Index      var someObject  GetObjectFromService     if someObject.SomeProperty  X   NullReferenceException here if someObject  null          do something            about 40 more lines of code      return View     Stack trace shows NullReferenceException here  codepre  pThis has happened twice for actions on the same controller. The second case was logged onp  precode someObject is known nonnull because of earlier dereferences return someObject.OtherProperty      RedirecToActionViewName, ControllerName      RedirectToActionOtherView, OtherController codepre  pThis is very disturbing. codeNullReferenceExceptioncode is very easy to fix once you know what line it occurs on. Its not quite so easy if the exception could have happened anywhere within the controller actionp  pHas anyone ever seen anything like this at all, either in ASP.NET MVC or elsewhere Im willing to believe its the difference between a Release build and a Debug build, but still, to be off by 40 linesp  hr  h3EDITh3  pTo be clear Im the original author of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4660142whatisanullreferenceexceptionandhowdoifixitWhat is a NullReferenceException and how do I fix ita.  I know what a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode is. This question is about why could the stack trace be emsoem far off. I have seen cases where a stack trace is off by a line or two due to PDB mismatch. I have seen cases where there is no PDB, so you dont get line numbers. But I have never seen a case where the stack trace is off by 32 lines.p  h3EDIT 2h3  pNote that this has happened with two separate controller actions within the same controller. Their code is quite different from each other. In fact, in the first case, the codeNullReferenceExceptioncode didnt even occur in a conditional  it was more like thisp  precodeSomeMethodsomeObject.SomeProperty codepre  pThere was some chance that the code had been reorganized during optimization so that the actual codeNullReferenceExceptioncode occurred closer to the codereturncode, and the PDB was in fact only off by a few lines. But I dont see an opportunity to rearrange a method call in a way that would cause the code to move by 32 lines. In fact, I just looked at the decompiled source, and it does not appear to have been rearranged.p  pWhat these two cases have in common arep  ol liThey occur in the same controller so farli liIn both cases, the stack trace points to the codereturncode statement, and in both cases, the codeNullReferenceExceptioncode occurred 30 or more lines away from the codereturncode statement.li ol  h3EDIT 3h3  pI just did an experiment  I just rebuilt the solution using the Production build configuration that we have deployed to our Production servers. I ran the solution on my local IIS, without changing the IIS configuration at all.p  pThe stack trace showed the correct line number.p  h3EDIT 4h3  pI dont know if this is relevant, but the circumstance causing the codeNullReferenceExceptioncode is as unusual as this wrong line number issue itself. We appear to be losing session state for no good reason no restarts or anything. Thats not too strange. The strange part is that our SessionStart should be redirecting to the login page when that happens. Any attempt to reproduce the session loss causes the redirect to the login page. Subsequently using the browser Back button or manually entering the previous URL goes right back to the login page without hitting the controller in question.p  pSo maybe two weird problems is really one emveryem weird problem.p  h3EDIT 5h3  pI was able to obtain the .PDB file, and to look at it with a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryb5ke49f5.aspx relnofollowdia2dumpa. I thought it was possible that the PDB was messed up, and emonlyem had line 72 for the method. Thats not the case. All the line numbers are present in the PDB.p  h3EDIT 6h3  pFor the record, this just happened again, in a third controller. The stack trace points directly to the return statement of a method. emThisem return statement is simply codereturn modelcode. I dont think theres emanyem way for that to cause a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode.p  Edit 6a  pIn fact, I just looked more closely at the log and found several exceptions which are emnotem codeNullReferenceExceptioncode, and which still have the stack trace point at the codereturncode statement. Both of these cases are in methods emcalled fromem the controller action, not directly in the action method itself. One of these was an explicitly thrown codeInvalidOperationExceptioncode, and one was a simple codeFormatExceptioncode.p  hr  pHere are a couple of facts I havent thought relevant until nowp  ol liThe codeApplicationErrorcode in the global.asax is what causes these exceptions to be logged. It picks up the exceptions by using codeServer.GetLastErrorcode.li liThe logging mechanism logs the message and stack trace separately instead of logging codeex.ToStringcode, which would have been my recommendation. In particular, the stack trace that Ive been asking about comes from codeex.StackTracecode.li liThe codeFormatExceptioncode was raised in codeSystem.DateTime.Parsecode, called from codeSystem.Convert.ToDatecode, called from our code. The stack trace line that points to our code is the line that points to codereturn modelcode.li ol

Negative 6067 pWhat happens when a branch containing a submodule and a branch tracking a remote are merged  p
Negative 6067 pHello all I am new to stackoverflow so please forgive me if I make some mistakes. I am asked to write a program that develops rectangles and circles from points that are made up of fractions. I have a class defined for my Fraction and I have overloaded the binary operator friend functions for the insertion and extraction ltlt amp  for my fraction. while overloading the operators in my Point class I am getting this error and I cannot figure out why I am getting it, even though I overloaded the operator in my Fraction class. I know the problem has to be in my syntax for the definition of the friend function in my Fraction class. I am lost and any help will be appreciated. I am not allowed to use global libraries.

Negative 6067 pI have been playing around with codeecryptfscode to manually mountunmount a private store via codeecryptfsmountprivatecode and codeecryptfsumountprivatecode. When Im logged in as a user with codeecryptfscode configured ie username is strongbobstrong, it asks for my login password for my Linux user account in order to mount the private store. If I change my password while Im logged into the system via the codepasswdcode command line utility, codeecryptfscode requires my new password in order to mount the private store.p  pIf I log in as the coderootcode user ie sysadmin and change the password for the strongbobstrong account via codesudo passwd bobcode, and then log into Bobs account, codeecryptfsmountprivatecode will fail when I use the new password I set while logged in as coderootcode.p  pMy understanding is that codeecryptfscode uses a hash of the user password to generate another hashkey thats used to wrap the encrypted files in the private store. But if thats the case, why does it just work when I change the password when logged in as the actual user, but not when I reset the password as rootp  pMy best guess so far is that maybe some setting is passed to the codepasswdcode utility which causes it to run a secondary script after completion. Does anyone know for sure how this works with codeecryptfscodep  pThanksp

As per the code, even if the file has already been found in the first directory path, it searches for the same file in the remaining 4 directories. Is there a better way to do it reducing the rumber of iterations p  pIn my case, I will normally have atleast 10 directory paths and 20 files in the listbox to search, so the loop will iterate for 200 times always which will bring down the performance.     p

Negative 6067 pFor example, if some C class in an assembly has a property codepropertycode, compiler generates codesetpropertycode and codegetpropertycode methods, or if there is a lambda, compiler also generates helper class codecDisplayClasscode or something like it.

As you can see from the test, Ive attempted to mock the request object as well as the first method that is called in the controller action codereq.allParamscode.

Moreover, thinking about mocking up this function raises all sorts of other questions. Why am I mocking up this function in the first place The logic of unit testing is, I think, that you test parts of your code in isolation with others, but isnt this going a bit far It also generates a whole lot of extra work because I would need to simulate the behavior of this function, which may or may not be simple to accomplish. p  pThe code Ive written here is based on a couple of proofofconcept type tutorials see a hrefhttpsblog.sergiocruz.meunittestsailsjswithmochaandinstanbulforcodecoverage relnofollowherea, a hrefhttpblog.jeffryhesse.comtestdrivendevelopmentinsailsjswithmongoosemochaandchai relnofollowherea, and a hrefhttpwww.tysoncadenhead.comblogunittestingsailsjsapplicationswithmocha.VTOXYK2qpBc relnofollowherea, but these posts do not deal with the problem in which you have methods on the req andor res objects in the controller. p  pWhat is the right way to approach a solution here Any insight would be greatly appreciated p

Negative 6067 pI have designed a login page in webcenter portal. The page has username and password fields and a command button. There is a managed bean also called LoginBean. What I want is when the user gives the username and password fields and hit the login button, the user will get a msg Welcome username in the next page. I have developed this thing in a jsf application. Its working fine there. As we know that webcenter portal is based on ADF and ADF is dependent on JSF so I thought that the same logic will work in ADF also. But when I am hitting the login button , I am getting Cannot find a skin that matches family portal and version v1.2. We will use the skin portal.desktop  msg in console. Its not even hitting the method which is written against the action attribute for the command buttonp

Negative 6067 pI am trying to calculate the residuals res for my 19 time series variables. I expect a nIndices, matrix as an outcome from the calculation. The res calculation works perfectly if applied to 1 individual time series, however it does not work if I try to calculate it with a loop for all time series. It will only calculate res for the first time series thus I get a 1, matrix instead of nIndices,.  The nIndices function correctly calculated 19 time series and was applied in the same editor file many times before. p  pI would appreciate any hints on what I am missing here. p  precodefor i1nIndices       res  returns,imeanreturns,i end codepre

Negative 6067 pIve made use of a few of scalas builtin type classes, and created a few of my own.

Negative 6067 pIm working in a Node.js project where we use passport for authentication. To bridge the authentication to socket.ioengine.io instead we use passport.socketio package. This works great in the browser as the available cookies are sent in the initial socket.ioengine.io handshake that is done via HTTP.p  pWhen we try write tests with mocha for the socket API how ever by first logging in via passport HTTP call with the module request we cannot find a way to pass the received session cookie along with the socket.ioclient that uses engine.ioclient initial connection. Hence we cannot find a way to write these tests in mocha.p  pIs there a way to set additional headers to be sent in the handshake or to share a cookie jar between the request and socket connection or is there another solution to thisp  pthere is an outdated hack solution but it is not working any more jfromaniellopassport.socketio72p

Both codeSetDatacode calls are strongallowedstrong to be done simultaneously. They do not interfere with each other, only with the critical section.  Generally speaking accessing one codeAPIObjectcode from multiple threads is strongnotstrong threadsafe but accessing multiple codeAPIObjectscode does not interfere with the API except during critical section. The critical section must never be executed while any codeAPIObjectcode Method is used. Guarding access to one codeAPIObjectcode from multiple threads is not required.p  hr  pstrongThe trivial approachstrongp  pUse a lock Object and codelockcode the critical section and every call to API Objects.p  pThis would effectively work but creates many unnecessary locks because of the fact that then also only one codeAPIObjectcode at a time could be accessed too.p  hr  pstrongConcurrent container of Actionsstrongp  pUse a single instance of a concurrent container where each modification of an codeAPIObjectcode is placed into a thread safe container and is executed in the task above explicitly by traversing the container outside the critical section and calling all actions. Not a Consumer pattern, as waiting for new entries of the container must not block the task since the critical section must be executed periodicallyp  pThis imposes some drawbacks. Closure issues when capturing contexts could be one. Another would be reading from an codeAPIObjectcode returns old data as long as the actions in the container are not executed. Even worse if the creation of an codeAPIObjectcode is put in the container and subsequent code assumes it has already be created.p  hr  pstrongMake something up with Wait Handles and atomic incrementsstrongp  pEvery codeAPIObjectcode access could be guarded with a codeManualResetEventcode. The critical section would wait for the signal to be set by the codeAPIObjectscode, the signal would only be set when all calls to codeAPIObjectscode have finished some sort of atomic incrementsdecrement around accessing codeAPIObjectscode.p  pSounds like a great way for deadlocks. May lock out the critical section for long periods of time when continuous codeAPIObjectcode calls prevent the signal from being ever set.p  pDoes not solve the problem that codeAPIObjectscode may not be accessed during critical section since this construct only guards in the other direction. Requires additional locking e.g codeMonitor.IsEnteredcode on the critical section to not lock out simultaneous calls to distinct codeAPIObjectscode.p  p Awful way, making a complex situation even more complexp

Negative 6067 pI have a mule flow with a httpinboundendpoint that uses an exchangepattern of requestresponse.p  pI am noticing something strange in my exception handling.  I have two catch exception blocks inside a choice exception block, one that sets the http status to 500 and one to 401.

Negative 6067 pFirst question, might be dumb, be easy on me.p  pSo I have an object creator followed by a set of variables, az, which create 26 objects with names az. I have a piece of code which generates a random letter from az and i would like to display a property of the  randomly picked object, but the letter is generated as a string, and codea.typecode comes out as undefined understandably. so i need to take that string, and remove the quotes from it basically so i can use it. i found somewhere on here someone said codea.charAt0code would work but it doesnt in my case. heres a very simplified version of the codep  precodefunction Objecttype      this.type  type   var a  new Objectannoying  var random  a  console.lograndom.type codepre  pI just want it to log codeannoyingcode but i believe that codechance.charactercode is making it log codea.typecode instead of codea.typecode.

Negative 6067 pSo here my problem.  I have a Linux program running on a VM which uses OpenCL via dlopen to execute some commands.  About half way through the programs execution it will sleep, and upon resume can make no assumptions about any state on the GPU in fact, the drivers may have been reloaded and the physical GPU may have changed.  Before sleeping dlclose is called and this does unload the OpenCL memory regions which is a good thing, but the libraries OpenCL uses cuda and nvidia libraries in this case are NOT unloaded.  Thus when the program resumes and tries to reinitalize everything again, things fail.brbr So what Im looking for is a method to effectively unlinkunload the shared libraries that OpenCL was using so it can properly restart itself.  As a note, the process itself can be paused stopped during this transition for as long as needed, but it may not be killed.br Also, assume Im working with root access and have more or less no restrictions on what files I can modifytouch.p

Negative 6067 pI am working on a simple for the moment Google API application that reads Google Analytics data from a customers Analytics account.  m completely new to the Google API, so I started out using a single customers Google login, with their permission, and got the application working that way.  That is, I was signed into Google on my machine using their account, and ran the app from my local machine using a PHP script and callback page that were both on my local server.  It worked.  p  pNow I want to generalize the app so I can use it with any customer that has an Analytics account.  To that end, I did the followingp  ul lisigned out of the first customers Google accountli lisigned into an old Google Developer account that I haveli lipicked a project in this old account of mine, changed its name, and created a new secrets.json  file for it.li licopied the working apps PHP files this is all done in PHP to new filenames and set it up to use the new secrets.json file and callback file name.  li liwiped my browsers cache to get rid of any lingering traces of the old app.li ul  pI did not change any other code in the app files  its working, I figured, so why change itp  pProblem When I run the new app and it contacts Google for permission to access the customers Analytics data, Google reacts as if the call is coming from the old app.  It then throws a security error because the redirect URI in the access request doesnt match the redirect URI on record for the old app.  p  pIve looked everywhere I can think of, and I cant find any way to reset the app name, so that Google will see this as the new app, not the old one.  What am I doing wrong  What did I miss   p

Negative 6067 pI have a table which consists of just id amp category, I then have a form with a drop down box which uses the category column to populate it. The next step is when the submit button is clicked it sends all the data into another table [producttable], All the data submits to the product table, but rather than the category name inserting it is inserting the id.  Ive tried multiple fixes to no avail, Im thinking the easiest way would be to take outputted category 1,2,3... and use a query to convert it to hat,shirt,shoes... using the categorytable. Im not 100 sure how to do this though,p  pindex.phpp  precodeltdiv idaddProductgt                ltPHP requireonceaddProduct.php gt                             ltdiv idpageSubTitle styledisplayblockgt                                ltform methodpost actiongt                     lth2gtAdd a Productlth2gt                                               lttablegt                             lttrgt                                 lttdgtltlabelgtProduct Name ltlabelgt ltinput typetext idproductName nameproductName requiredgtlttdgt                                     lttdgtltlabel idcategoryLabelgt Catagory ltlabelgt                                     ltphp                                         mysqlconnectlocalhost, root, or diemysqlerror                                         mysqlselectdbwebscripting or diemysqlerror                                          query  SELECT id,category FROM catagorytable ORDER BY category ASC                                         result  mysqlqueryquery or diemysqlerror.[.query.]                                     gt                                                                       ltselect typetext idcategory namecategorygt                                     ltphp                                          while row  mysqlfetcharrayresult                                                                                      echo ltoption value.row[id].gt.row[category].ltoptiongt                                                                              gt                                       ltselectgtltp idrefreshCatagoryOnNewProductgt New catagory not appearingltbr gt lta hrefindex.phpgtClick Hereltagtltpgtlttdgt                             lttrgt                                                            lttrgt                                 lttdgtltlabelgtStock ltlabelgt ltinput typenumber idstock namestock requiredgtlttdgt                                 lttdgtltlabel idcostLabelgtCost ltlabelgt ltinput typetext idcost namecost requiredgtlttdgt                             lttrgt                                                            lttrgt                                 lttdgtltlabelgtDescription ltlabelgt lttextarea typetext iddescription namedescription cols40 rows5 maxlength250 placeholderEnter Description Hereamp10Max 250 Characters... requiredgtlttextareagtlttdgt                                 lttdgtlttdgt                                                                lttrgt                                                            lttrgt                                 lttdgtltinput idproductSubmit typesubmit valueAdd Product onclicksubmitProductgtlttdgt                             lttrgt                         lttablegt                                             ltformgt                              ltdivgt                   ltdivgt codepre  paddProduct.phpp  precodeltPHP  dbhost  localhost dbname  webscripting dbroot  root dbpass    odb  new PDOmysqlhostdbhostdbnamedbname, dbroot, dbpass  ifissetPOST[productName]      productName  POST[productName]     categoryName  POST[category]     stock  POST[stock]     cost  POST[cost]     description  POST[description]     q  INSERT INTO Producttablename, category, stock, cost, description VALUESname, category, stock, cost, description     query  odbgtprepareq     results  querygtexecutearray         name gt productName,         category gt categoryName,         stock gt stock,         cost gt cost,         description gt description        gt codepre  p I know theres a few spelling mistakes in the code usually categorycatagory but its consistent throughout,p  pAny helpadvice would be great appreciatedp

Negative 6067 pI have come across the problem that people on my website can doublesubmit a form. This isnt an issue from the database side, as the records are saved by serverside validation. However, its important I invalidate any additional requests so that users dont get double charged as the charge occurs prior to the account being made. I would prefer to drop the request entirely as opposed to redirecting because it will really ruin the UX, whereas dropping the request will just make the process appear longer which is a better compromise.p  pTo clear things up, I am also using the postredirectget pattern, but it does not solve this problem, which is actually the most critical problem because it is the most common. Implementing a clientside solution will be done for cleanliness of the UI, but I cannot trust the user to not disable javascript or somehow tamper with it.p  pI have a middleware solution using the library codecsurfcode that doesnt quite work.p  precodevar protectroute  functionreq, res, next   ifreq.session.uniquerequests     req.session.uniquerequests  []       var found  .findreq.session.uniquerequests, functiontoken     return token  req.body.csrf       iffound    req.session.uniquerequests.pushreq.body.csrf    next    else     nextroute drop the post, and skip anything else.      var unlockroute  functionreq, res, next   req.session.uniquerequests  .withoutreq.session.uniquerequests, req.body.csrf  codepre  pI attach it to my routes like sop  precoderouter.postcreate, protectroute, functionreq, res     If it makes it in here, the route is protected and the      request wasnt dropped.   router.getreview, unlockroute, functionreq, res     The form will once again be able to be submitted.  codepre  pUnfortunately, even though the middleware gets called, if I mash the create button it will fire off a ton of requests, each will attempt to push the token onto the codeuniquerequestscode, and the result is it wont block any requests for a few pushes until everything catches up.p  pWhat am I doing wrong here, and how can I fix itp  pstrongEDITstrong Ratelimiting the POST to create seems like a possibility, though it doesnt seem like a emrealem solution I suppose.

Negative 6067 pI am writing some integration tests for some software that relies heavily on information in its database. A majority of the logic behind our system runs via transactional SQL scripts and DDLDML triggers against a large database. p  pWhen writing the unit tests we couldnt guarantee what order the unit tests would run in, so we had a baseline database state that each test would expect to be run from, with some data setup for each test which is a known constant. At the end of each test all of the changes it makes are rolled back. Because this was written in Java it was as simple as using the JUnit annotations p  precodeTest Transactional  Rollbacktrue codepre  pNow that we are running integration tests we dont have access to the JUnit annotations. We are running the tests by starting up our software and then making API calls to it and verifying certain states in the database are what we expect them to be. p  pWe still cannot guarantee what order the tests will be executed in, so we need each test to be run from a baseline state, and then have all of its changes reverted after we make our verifications. This we have constant knowledge about what state the database at the start for each test. p  pIs there some way to put the database we are testing in such a state that everything it considers from that point on as part of one big transaction that we can then roll back I know we could just take a snapshot and restore from that, but depending on the size of the database and the amount of changes that each test may make it would be far emfarem quicker to just be able to rollback.p

Negative 6067 pI tried to collect beach data in a certain region. I used both overpass api and osmosis to extract beach from a pbf. Both worked. But from overpass api, i can get beach polygons closed ways and points nodes, however, from osmosis, I can just get points nodes. When I search in osmosis, I did include the ways and relations. Still, I didnt get beach polygons as i got from overpass. p  pAnyone may have some solutions or explanation Many thanksp
Negative 6067 pI am saving the output of web scrawling using scrapy in a csv file. The crawling itself seems to be working correctly, but I am not happy with the format of the output saved in csv file. I crawl 20 webpages where each page contains 100 job titles and their respective urls.
