Positive 4963 pI am notdoing a school project, so please do not be alarmed. I am doing some private programming to brush up. My program, a program of type .java, creates a form that asks for the boundaries and quantities of a lotterydrawing activity and acts on the generating based on the input.p  pHeres my problem. On the WIndows 2000 computer where I coded the program, shows itself, perfectly. Thats only half the story. When I tried to put it on another computer, the program shows a blank window it compiles and runs, but it shows a blank window. Now, I do consider version numbers to be factors, so I will provide the versions and ask for confirmation if those are the root of the evil.p  pOn my original computer, which is Windows 2000, the version is 1.6.031b05. The other computer, which is Windows 7 dualbooted with Linux Mint 17.2, is running 1.8.060b27 and 1.8.000 respectively.p  pMy program is not finished yet, but Ill worry about that later. What Im hoping to do now is to get the program, such as it is, to run on the platforms of all my computers. Since Java is known for its portability, I expect it to run on all my computers. Is that a misconceptionp  pAnyways, heres the codep  precodeImport class libraries import javax.swing.               import javax.swing.JOptionPane               import java.awt.      import java.awt.event.  public class Lotterygui     Begin class      VARIABLES FOR DATA COLLECTION     private JTextField lowerRange  Lowest number     private JTextField higherRange Highest number     private JTextField quantity    How many numbers to generate     private JTextArea displayArea  What to display when the program is in use      ADD WARNING CONSTANT FOR INVALID INPUT     private final String WARNING  Please fill out valid data                                      and not leave anything out.

Mainly because windows alttab is not memorising order of open windows in it.

Because actually I dont need whole program, only this feature. I saw some code for it on web but its not working in win 764.

Also when it run out of leftright windows it should circle back to starting windowlike normal alt tab is doing.p

Negative 4963 pIm working on an Eclipse RCP application. Today I experienced some troubles when displaying images in the context menu. What I wanted to do is to add a column to my table containing images of stars for representing a user rating. On Windows, this causes some problems, since the star images are squeezed up on the left corner of the table cell instead of expanding on the whole cell, but Ill solve that somehow. In addition I have a context menu on the table, with an entry called rate where again the different stars from 1 to 5 representing the rating level are shown, such that the user can click on it for choosing different ratings. That works fine on Windows. Now I switched to Linux Ubuntu to see how it works out there, and strangely, the stars in the table cell are layed out perfectly, while the stars on the context menu dont even show up.  p  h2h2  pOn the context menu Im using an action class where Im setting the image descriptor for the star imagesp  precodepublic class RateAction extends Action   private final int fRating  private IStructuredSelection fSelection    public RateActionint rating, IStructuredSelection selection   super, ASCHECKBOX  fRating  rating  fSelection  selection    setImageDescriptorcreateImageDescriptor        Creates the correct ImageDescriptor depending on the given rating   return   private ImageDescriptor createImageDescriptor  ImageDescriptor imgDescriptor  null switch fRating  case 0 return OwlUI.NEWSSTARON0 case 1 return OwlUI.NEWSSTARON1 case 2 return OwlUI.NEWSSTARON2 case 3 return OwlUI.NEWSSTARON3 case 4 return OwlUI.NEWSSTARON4 case 5 return OwlUI.NEWSSTARON5  default break   return imgDescriptor      see org.eclipse.jface.action.ActiongetText   Override public String getText  return no text, since the images of the stars will be displayed return       ... codepre  pp  pDoes somebody know why this strange behaviour appearsp  pThanks a lot.p  pFor some strange reason, the images dont appear.

Negative 4963 pI came across issue where I need to animate height change of UILabel frame or its enclosing views frame. Label is multiline.p  pThe issue is that given with large text which does not fit initially into labelsay it takes 3 lines, then animating the labels height to increase, immediately changing 3 line to 4 and then animating the frame increase.p  pOpposite effect is when the text fully fit into label4 lines, then I animate height decrease, 4 lines are instantly becoming 3 and only then I see animating frame size decrease.p  pThis is of course not good for an eye. p  pWhat I expect is something like keep the labels origin.y intact and then as frame is increasing the more text is revealing from the bottom. The ellipsis may convert to missing word instantly, that is not a problem.p

Negative 4963 pSuppose we have a map that is shared between multiple threads. It represents a node in some hierarchical structure say, a directory in a file system that is stored on disk. Constructing a Value is expensive both in time and in memory. This is the classic initialize on demand problem, with a twist were initializing values in a map when theres lookup request, but we dont want to lock the ementireem map while were doing this in order to let other threads access already constructed values. In this application, lookups of existing Values will be emmuchem more common then nonexisting ones.p  pstrongAttempt 1strong Grab write lock on map, check for presence of Key, return if present, otherwise, construct Value, put in map.p  pstrongEvaluationstrong This prevents other threads from accessing the map while were constructing the Value. Since reads are very common and very fast, this will manifest itself as an ugly jump in latency not good.p  pstrongAttempt 2strong Grab read lock on map, check for presence of Key, return if present, otherwise release read lock, construct Value, grab write lock, check for presence, if not present, put in map, if present delete newly constructed Value.p  pstrongEvaluationstrong Now we dont incur the jump in read latency, but we might end up needlessly constructing several in memory representations of the same Value when multiple threads try to look up the same yetunconstructed Value simultaneously. Problem is, we dont want this these Values are emreallyem expensive to create. Besides, they might start firing events or doing IO, which means that now we have to deal with a design that allows ephemeral yet heavyweight Value instances to exist an additional headache better avoided.p  pstrongAttempt 3strong Use twolevels of locks. Grab read lock on map, lookup Key, return if present, otherwise, release read lock on map, grab write lock on map, check for placeholder, grab placeholders read lock, if present, otherwise, create placeholder, grab its write lock, insert into map, release write lock on map, create Value, replace placeholder with Value, release placeholders write lock.p  pstrongEvaluationstrong Inserting a placeholder into the map while constructing the Value guarantees that only one thread will attempt it, thus addressing the problems of Attempt 2. However, this design leaves open the question what emformem this placeholder should take The answer is not trivial. First, if it contains a lock and threads wait on it, it becomes hard to delete it How do you know nobodys holding the placeholders lock You can grab it, sure, but then emyouem are holding it so, again, you cannot delete it. Second, there can be lookups of Keys for which no Value exists on disk. If we insert a placeholder for emeveryem lookup attempt even for ones that will eventually fail then whos going to clean these up Finally, with two levels of locks, the code becomes quite ugly we first grab read lock, check, then acquire write lock, recheck, and we need to do this both at the map level, and the individual placeholder level easy to create deadlocks, I can attest to it.p  pThis little baby keeps popping up and I cant seem to find an elegant solution. Attempt 3 is the closest I got to satisfying my performance conditions, but its ugly and error prone once you get down to the dirty details. I would really appreciate any insights or suggestions.p

Negative 4963 pfor days now, I try to get the following scenario runningp  pI have a Silverlight 4 Application that calls a WCFService via HTTPS. The WCFService is located on one of our servers, the Silverlight 4 app is also served from this server. After several hours of trial and error well actually more error than try I get it running when starting it from my VS2010 development environment on my local machine see also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4086589securityerrorwhencallingahttpswcfservicefromsilverlight440873534087353httpstackoverflow.comquestions4086589securityerrorwhencallingahttpswcfservicefromsilverlight440873534087353a.p  pBut ...p  pThe call to the httpsWCF ONLY works when I start the SLApp from my VS2010 AND when fiddler is running and after I tell fiddler to ignore the Certificate Error I use a selfsigned certificate. When fiddler is not running, I get a security error. That applies, when my browser is the IE. When I copy the localhost address from the IE and paste it in my opera, it works without fiddler.br When I deploy the Silverlight app to the server and call it from the server, the WCFcall doesnt work, whether fiddler is running or not. I just get the standard Message, that an exception has occurred. This happens in both Opera and IE. Fiddler doesnt ask me to ignore the Certificate Error like it does in the VS2010 scenario, so maybe there is somewhere the key to my problem. Unfortunately, I have not much experiences with this stuff, so I have no idea, where to look or what to do.p  pI already found something about the fiddler issue here on stackoverflow  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3971828silverlightrequestsfailuresfiddlerhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3971828silverlightrequestsfailuresfiddlera, but it doesnt help me solving my problem.p  pI hope that some of you can shed some light in this issue, before all my hair is turned to gray.p  pThanks in advance,br Frankp  pEdith has just installed the Certificate as a trusted Certificate in IE  but I still get the error, when calling the WCF when starting the deployed silverlight app from the server. At least I can call the Service when I start the SL app from VS2010 in the IE now even when that doesnt help me, when some one else has to work with the app.p

Negative 4963 pIm intending to create a web service which performs a large number of manuallyspecified calculations as fast as possible, and have been exploring the use of DLR.p  pSorry if this is long but feel free to skim over and get the general gist.p  pIve been using the IronPython library as it makes the calculations very easy to specify. My works laptop gives a performance of about 400,000 calculations per second doing the followingp  precodeScriptEngine py  Python.CreateEngine ScriptScope pys  py.CreateScope  ScriptSource src  py.CreateScriptSourceFromString def result     res  [None]1000000     for i in range0, 1000000         res[i]  b.GetValue  1     return res result   CompiledCode compiled  src.Compile pys.SetVariableb, new DynamicValue  long start  DateTime.Now.Ticks var res  compiled.Executepys long end  DateTime.Now.Ticks  Console.WriteLine...Finished. Sample data  for int i  0 i lt 10 i      Console.WriteLineres[i]   Console.WriteLineTook   end  start  10000  ms to run 1000000 times. codepre  pWhere DynamicValue is a class that returns random numbers from a prebuilt array seeded and built at run time.p  pWhen I create a DLR class to do the same thing, I get much higher performance 10,000,000 calculations per second. The class is as followsp  precodeclass DynamicCalc  IDynamicMetaObjectProvider      DynamicMetaObject IDynamicMetaObjectProvider.GetMetaObjectExpression parameter              return new DynamicCalcMetaObjectparameter, this           private class DynamicCalcMetaObject  DynamicMetaObject              internal DynamicCalcMetaObjectExpression parameter, DynamicCalc value  baseparameter, BindingRestrictions.Empty, value            public override DynamicMetaObject BindInvokeMemberInvokeMemberBinder binder, DynamicMetaObject[] args                      Expression Add  Expression.ConvertExpression.Addargs[0].Expression, args[1].Expression, typeofSystem.Object             DynamicMetaObject methodInfo  new DynamicMetaObjectExpression.BlockAdd, BindingRestrictions.GetTypeRestrictionExpression, LimitType             return methodInfo                codepre  pand is calledtested in the same way by doing the followingp  precodedynamic obj  new DynamicCalc long t1  DateTime.Now.Ticks for int i  0 i lt 10000000 i      results[i]  obj.Addar1[i], ar2[i]  long t2  DateTime.Now.Ticks codepre  pWhere ar1 and ar2 are prebuilt, runtime seeded arrays of random numbers.p  pThe speed is great this way, but its not easy to specify the calculation. Id basically be looking at creating my own lexer amp parser, whereas IronPython has everything I need already there.p  pId have thought I could get much better performance from IronPython since it is implemented on top of the DLR, and I could do with better than what Im getting.p  pIs my example making best use of the IronPython engine Is it possible to get significantly better performance out of itp  pEdit Same as first example but with the loop in C, setting variables and calling the python functionp  precodeScriptSource src  py.CreateScriptSourceFromStringb  1  CompiledCode compiled  src.Compile  double[] res  new double[1000000]  forint i0 ilt1000000 i      pys.SetVariableb, args1[i]     res[i]  compiled.Executepys  codepre  pwhere pys is a ScriptScope from py, and args1 is a prebuilt array of random doubles. This example executes slower than running the loop in the Python code and passing in the entire arrays.p

If you change ychange to something like 0.01, it will draw each tube segment offset an additional 0.01 in the y direction. That great, but how can I make each segment point in that direction In other words, right now, each segment is drawn so that they all face the same direction, and the direction is not the direction of the tube since with ychange  0.01, the direction is slightly up.p  pIm not sure how to proceed. Ive played with vectors by getting the vector between the previous segment and the current one, but Im not really sure what to do with it past that.p

Negative 4963 pI have a generic EL producer that Ive written to take advantage of WELDs ability to just make it work when I need it done, and even have the type coercion written into the function so that it makes sure the return type matches the weld injection point.p  pHeres my problem WELD resolves from the injection points assignable types, ie, if your injection point is a String, it will only look for producers with a String return type.p  pThis is problematic, as I want one producer that will take care of the type coercion, and hand back a correctly typed object.p  pAs a kludge, I have a String producer method that aliases to the real producer, and only does the type kludging.p  pThis... at least works, until I get to the situation of having an Object typed injection point, at which point ALL of my kludge methods AND the generic producer ALL are matched, giving an ambiguous dependency exception, even if I use Typed on the producers.p  pIs there a sane way around this, or should I give up on this idea of making WELD do all the hard work for mep  pHeres an example of the use of this producer, from an error handling bean with a Request scope. RequestURI is the one that is troublesome in this case, the other two require typed kludge methods to work.  The main function of this particular bean code not included is to catch unhandled exceptions and report them via email to us for more specific error handling in future revisions.  The basic usecase here is to simplify programmatic access to EL, and potentially to allow writing back to EL using the value binding, though thats not possible in this particular code.p  pI know I can do the below using other methods, thats not the point.  Realistically, its a positive thing to make it easier to access EL programmatically IMO, especially when dealing with some of the more exotic scopes especially Flash scope introduced by JSF 2.0.

Beyond the simple cases of the codeInterlockedXxxcode functions, it seems like the prevailing pattern with all of these is that they emimplement their own locksem. Sure, there are not processor locks, but the concept of looping over and over on each CPU to ensure consistency is very much like a spinlock. And being a spinlock, they are going to be less efficient than the general locks that come with the operating system because they do not yield control of their quanta while waiting for other threads. Therefore, whenever someone comes to me and says but my algorithm is lockfree, my general response is sop  pIm curious  are there strongbenchmarksstrong available which show lock free algorithms to have an edge over their lockfull counterpartsp

Negative 4963 pI just came to this awful situation where I have an array of strings each representing a possibly existing file e.g. codevar files  [file1, file2, file3]code. I need to loop through these file names and try to see if it exists in the current directory, and if it does, stop looping and forget the rest of the remaining files. So basically I want to find the first existing file of those, and fallback to a hardcoded message if nothing was found.p  pThis is what I currently havep  precodevar found  false files.forEachfunctionfile    if found return false    fs.readFileSyncpath  file, functionerr, data      if err return      found  true     continueWithStuff      if found  false     Handle this scenario.  codepre  pThis is bad. Its blocking readFileSync thus its slow.p  pI cant just supply callback methods for codefs.readFilecode, its not that simple because I need to take the first found item... and the callbacks may be called at any random order. I think one way would be to have a callback that increases a counter and keeps a list of foundnot found information and when it reaches the codefiles.lengthcode count, then it checks through the foundnot found info and decides what to do next.p  pThis is painful. I do see the performance greatness in evented IO, but this is unacceptable. What choices do I havep

Negative 4963 pIn my onagainoffagain compiler project, Ive implemented closures as allocated memory with an executable prefix.  So a closure is allocated like thisp  precodec  makeclosurecodeptr, envsize, envdata codepre  pcodeccode is a pointer to a block of allocated memory, which looks like thisp  precodemovl closurecall, eax call eax .align 4  size of environment  environment data  pointer to closure code codepre  pclosurecall is a helper function that looks at the address most recently placed on the stack and uses it to find the closure data and code pointer.  Boehm GC is used for general memory management, and when the closure is no longer referenced it can be deallocated by the GC.p  pAnyway this allocated memory needs to be marked as executable in fact the entire pages it spans get marked.  As closures are created and deallocated, more and more heap memory in the process will be executable.p  pFor defensive programming reasons Id prefer to minimise the amount of executable heap.  My plan is to try to keep all closures together on the same pages, and to allocate and deallocate executable pages as needed i.e. to implement a custom allocator for closures.  This is easier if all closures are the same size so the first step is moving the environment data into a separate nonexecutable allocation that can be managed normally.  It also makes defensive programming sense.p  pBut the remaining issue is GC.  Boehm already does this  What I want is to somehow tell Boehm about my custom allocations, and get Boehm to tell me when theyre able to be GCd, but to leave it up to me to deallocate them.p  pSo my question is, are there hooks in Boehm that provide for custom allocations like thisp

I know that all uploaded files before moving to final storage destination eg storage servers or any solution are stored in tmp folder of apache. I was wondering if this is a rule for apache and all uploaded files should be located first in app server, so how can I control, scale and redirect this massive load of storage to a temporary storage or server I mean a server or storage solution as tmp folder of appche to just be guest of uploaded files before sending to the final storages places. I have studied and designed all the things about scaling of database, storages, load balancing, memcache etc. but this is one of my unsolved question. Where new arrived files by users to main server will be taken place in a scaled architect And what is the common solution for this In one box solution all files will be temporary in the tmp dir of appche but for massive amount of contents and in a scaled system.

Negative 4963 pIm attempting to implement a C DLL of my own creation that uses the Intel Performance Primitives in a C forms application.  Im getting a DLL Not Found Exception when I attempt to run the program.  One possible reason put forward in other posts on this site is that there are dependent DLLs that must be referenced and in fact after downloading DpendencyWalker I found that my DLL uses IPPS7.0.DLL.p  pMy problem is that it is unclear to me how to reference these dependent DLLs.  Ive added the IPPS7.0.DLL containing folder to referenced paths as well as added references to the IntelCppOptPkg and IntelLibOptPgk assemblies but this has not solved the problem.p  pSo, am I correct in believing this is the problem  And if so, how does one reference a depedent DLL in managed codep  pThank you.p

For example to populate a Set of Entities in a FormObject from the user selection within an HTML multi select box. p  pExcept in the case where the user selects nothing. Then the property codeSetltEntitygt selectioncode of FormObject gets codenullcode. Even if I assign an empty collection to that property in the constructor of the FormObject.

Negative 4963 pI have created objects that are interfaces to a web service.  One typical object would be a TaskService.  When a client uses one of these objects, it invokes one of the services methods such as GetTasks and the service will asynchronously go off to call the remote web service, and post back the retrieved data via a delegate.p  pCurrently, to use one of these services you have to create it with [[TaskService alloc] init], but I decided it makes more sense to make each service into a singleton object.p  pIs it common to see singleton objects that hold reference to delegates  My main issue with the design, is that each object, whenever it requires use of a particular service, will have to set itself as the delegate before invoking the service, which doesnt seem quite right to me...  What if another object were to set itself as the delegate inbetween you setting yourself as the delegate and invoking the servicep  pMany thanks in advancep  pRegards, Nickp

Negative 4963 pI have a scenario to optimise how my web app is storing data in the session and retrieving it. I should point out that Im using SQL Server as my session store.p  pMy scenario is I need to store a list of unique IDs mapped to string values in the users session for later use. The current code Ive inherited is using a codeListltTgtcode with a custom object but I can already see some kind of dictionary is far better for performance.p  pIve tested two ideas for alternativesp  ol lipStoring a codeDictionaryltint, stringgtcode in the session. When I need to get the strings back, I get the dictionary from the session once and can test each ID on the dictionary object.pli lipSince the session is basically like a dictionary itself, store the string directly in the session using a unique session key e.g. codeSession[MyStringltidgt]  stringValuecode. Getting the value out of the session would basically be the inverse operation.pli ol  pMy test results show the following based on the operation I need to do and using 100 stringsp  ul liDictionary  4552 bytes, 0.1071 seconds to do operationli liSession Direct  4441 bytes, 0.0845 seconds to do operationli ul  pFrom these results I see that I save some space in the session probably because Ive not got the overhead of serialising a dictionary object and it seems to be faster when getting the values back from the session, maybe because strings are faster to deserialise than objects.p  pSo my question is, is it better for performance to store lots of smaller objects in session rather than one big one Is there some disadvantage for storing lots of smaller objects vs. one bigger object that I havent seenp

Also run time error when clicking into a different combobox                         codepre  pI hope Ive been descriptive enough and posted enough code to give any possible code guru helpers a feel for what Im trying to accomplish.  If more information is needed, please let me know.  Any ideassolutions are greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 4963 pI am writing a WP7 app and would like to include features to share highscore data using Amazons AWS as storage service. p  pAs far as I understand WP7 XAP files are currently safely encrypted and no known jailbreak for the phone exists. However, given that such a safe encryption can be temporary, I would like to understand ifhow this violates best practice.p  pAWS dynamoDB uses temporary access tokens that can be generated using given account data and are valid for 36 hours the tokens must be verified using a signature with any request.   p  pI am considering that all access data will be stored in the XAP file, which will also generate the temporary access token and signature. The information will be passed via https requests between the phone and AWS.p  pI was trying to work out alternative processes including passing the generation of the temporary token calculation to an external webservice, however I cannot think of a way to protect this data which would not be similarly compromised if the XAP file was accessible. p  pAm I missing the best practice approach completely or am I just overly cautiousp  pThanks.p
Negative 4963 pI have a simple business requirement to design a Roster spreadsheet that can be read by a powershell script to extract out data for down stream processes.

Negative 4963 pIf you implement an interface compiler asks you to provide implementation of those methods. But in case of calling overridden clone method how compiler come to know that a particular interface is not mentioned here in this case codeCloneablecode in class declaration. How compiler does this mapping to tell user that CloneNotSupported  Is it has something to do with latebinding p  pI think JVM has information about each class in method area like what are classes it is extending and what are interfaces it is implementing. So calling clone method will check into those stored metadata about the class and finds out that codeCloneablecode is not in that list of interfaces   Is this somewhere close to correct answer  p

Negative 4963 pI have hierarchical clustering tree using linkage. Each cluster has its own level in the dendrogram which corresponds to the cost of that cluster. I have budget for n1 clusters with cost c1, n2 clusters with cost c2, and n3 clusters with cost c3. The question is to select which cluster using the budget to cover all original items. and c1c2c3. Clusters with cost c1 can be used for c2 or c3 clusters obviously. p  pFor only one budget category, the solution is trivial just start from the root and in each subtree when we go below c1 add it. If n1 categories are finished before subtrees there is no solution.p  pFor two categories it is also simple. Find all candidates for c1 cost. Label them with the number of c2 subclusters and sort them descendingly. Select the c1 categories with maximum label. Then select c2 clusters.p  pBut the problem is complex for more than 2 categories as sorting for c2 categories does not necessarily keeps track of c3 budget.p

Negative 4963 pI am developing a Cocoa Mac app which dynamically generates and registers itself for URL schemes. However, when the application registers itself to handle a newly generated URL scheme e.g. myscheme1423, I would like to prevent the application from responding to any previously registered URL schemes.p  pI am using codeLSSetDefaultHandlerForURLSchemecode for the purpose of registering a URL scheme in conjunction, the application automatically overwrites its Info.plist to contain the new scheme. As you may know, the codeLSSetDefaultHandlerForURLSchemecode function adds the given bundleIDscheme to a Launch Services database. However, I couldnt find an equivalent Launch Services function to remove the same bundleIDscheme pair from the database.p  pI know that I could simply ignore any external events which originated from a URL scheme other than the one for which the app is actively registered, but it feels to me that there should be a simple way to completely wipe out the systems knowledge of the previous scheme. If my application goes through the process of registering for a new scheme more than a few hundred times, a point will come where a significant amount of space for a Plist, at least is being taken up on disk by a plethora of pointless pieces of data i.e. the old Launch Services entries.p

Negative 4963 pIve recently been promoted to an admin, meaning my active directory username was given much more permissions. As such, I now have permissions to readwrite to our servers, which is something thats a little troubling. p  pBefore, if I ran any local code that ran something like codemyremotefile.deletecode, then it would ignore that method. Well, technically, it would return false. However, since my active directory username is now given all permissions on our servers, Java has no problem running that local code, and it will actually affect our servers.p  pI dont want to make the assumption that Ill always be careful when running local code, and I wanted to know if you guys had any ideas to relegate my permissions only in the case where I run local code within Eclipse. In other words, I want read only permissions on all of our server directories when I run any local code within Eclipse.p  pOne solution I thought of was to simply create another user, with read only permissions in active directory, but I think maintaining two accounts wont scale out well in the future.p

Changed rows are added to db successfully too. Then I call codeGetDatacode again to fill second codedataGridViewcode, but no rows are returned. Also there isnt any error during calling codeGetDatacode  the second time. But when I dont call codeUpdateTableChangescode and call codeGetDatacode the second time all rows are returned. There is some problem after codeUpdateTableChangescode method. Feeling that this method changes some data in my codeadaptercode. All parameters in all methods are correct, because rows are returned if I dont call codeUpdateTableChangescode. What need I change to get rows after adapter updates db Any help will be great.

Negative 4963 pThe problem is C does not allow namespace declarations within classes.I searched on internet and found this if its not true, please say it So, whats the best way to cheat this problemp  pContext My class have an enumeration within it.p  precodeclass GameCharacter  public     enum MovingState          Running,         Walking,         Stopped          ...  codepre  pOBS This example is not real, its totally hypothetical.p  pC defines that the enumeration names are inside the class scope, then to use these states I have to use the scope operator directly from the class namecodeGameCharacterRunningcode, for instance or codeusing GameCharacterRunningcode.p  pI think this is bad, because the name which belongs to the enumeration is inside the class scope I wanted to have a scope for the RunningState enumeration. accessing it this way codeGameCharacterMovingStateRunningcode My first thought, then, was to create a namespace which would define a scope for the enumeration.p  precodeclass GameCharacter  public      does not compile     namespace MovingState          enum State              Running,             Walking,             Stopped                   ...  codepre  pBut C forbids it.

However, for print I would like to hold on to a sharp frame, labels, and annotations.p  pDoes anyone know if it is possible to achieve this kind of hybrid rasterization in matplotlibp  pI can think of solutions involving imshow, and bypassing polycollection, but I would much prefer to use matplotlibs builtin components.p  pThanks for your advice.p

However, if I create a Playlist object with an alreadydefined collection, I get a basic array and not a Backbone.Collection.

That data is extended over the Playlists defaults and overwrites the Backbone.Collection entity.p  pWhat is a proper way to initialize with a populated Backbone.Collection I could write code in Initializes which checks the type of my items array and if it is not a Backbone.Collection I could create a new Backbone.Collection and add the items to it and then replace the old array with the new one, but that seems really hoakey.p

Negative 4963 pIm a two week old mac user, so bear with me here. Im trying to set EPD python up as my default python interpreter instead of the system python that came with the mac. It was my understanding that EPD does this automatically upon installation by modifying the .bashprofile, but after I installed EPD, the .bashprofile was unaltered and as far as I can see, system python is still the default interpreter. How do I go about changing thisp  pThe major reason why I want to change the default python to EPD is that all the packages I install are automatically placed into the LibraryPython2.7sitepackages directory instead of the sitepackages directory associated with EPD. In particular, I cant get PyCuda to install in EPDs sitepackages directory.p  pI hope this made some sort of sense. Im lost and not sure where to go from here. Help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4963 pI have an issue with sockets. Im creating a socket between my computer and my phone to send messages. When I close the server or the client it sends a FIN packet and it stays in the FINWAIT2 state for like a minute. However, the other side get stuck in the CLOSEWAIT state, apparently incapable of closing the socket. I reckon that sockets should be closed instantly, so maybe I should somehow implement a code in the client that closes the socket when the server wants to close it and vice versa. How can I do thatp

Negative 4963 pim working in a project that requires Asp.Net WebForms is a migration of a huge .net 2.0 site with no time to reimplement in MVC and asmx web services. When a page is requested is sent by the server and works like a SPA. After a while we realize that we need a model behind the javascript to avoid a nightmare code. We tried Knockout.js until we hit a problem that we coulnt solve Code reuse with User Controls and Knockout.js View Models. Our user controls has viewmodels that when several user controls are combined in a page. Knockout simply doesnt work. I know that maybe webforms are not the tipical stack when making SPA web apps, but well... requirements are requirements.... any helpp

Negative 4963 pMy vb.net code calculates the growth rate of a companys stock price for every quarter from 1901 to present and stores it in a datatable.  This takes a while to perform 1015 minutes.  I would like to save the information in the datatable after it is calculated so that I dont have to recalculate past growth rates every time I run the program.  When I open my program I want the datatable to contain any growth rates that have already been calculated so I only have to calculate growth rates for new quarters.p  pShould I store my datatable in a database of some kind or is there another way to do this  My datatable is quite large.  It currently has 450 columns one for each quarter from 1901 to present and can have thousands of rows one for each company.  Is this too big for Microsoft Access  Would Microsoft Excel be an optionp  pThanksp

We want those options to be copied into the models      meta object, right after the class has been defined.      For this, we have to listen to the classprepared signal from      django.db.models.signals. Because the djangomongodbengine module gets      imported as part of the initialization process of Djangos ORM django.db,      we can not import anything from django.db in this file or any other      submodule that is imported while the ORM initialization because that would      get us into recursive import hell which the Python interpreter doesnt allow.      The only way to make sure certain code is executed after Djangos ORM has been      initialized is registering an app. After initializing itself, Django imports      all apps defined in the projects settings.py in the order implied by      iterating over the INSTALLEDAPPS list. As we have to make sure that      djangomongodbengine is loaded very first, we prepend it to the list. except ImportError pass codepre

Negative 4963 pWe have a site where we are intending to sell access to video tutorials. I have set up Joomla ACL to limit access to those pages only to those users who have been given the relevant access permissions and access is being sold through shopping cart called MijoShop.p  pThis setup is working okay at the moment, but there is bit of an issue with user experience. At the moment it seems I can only stop people from viewing a page, but I cant see an easy way to show them alternative content with Joomla ACL. Ideally, if a loggedin user does not have access to a certain video tutorial page, when they click on the link to the page they will instead see a page giving them an opportunity to buy access to the tutorial. This means that I need a method for showing different content on the same page depending on which Joomla user groups a user is assigned to. Is this possible with vanilla Joomla ACL, or am I going to have to find a content management extension that can add the ability to do this p

The page I writing the test for works fine, but I am having problems getting a jstree object to load its initial data when faking the server responses with sinon in the test.p  pTo make sure that the page I am testing and the test I am writing are using the same response data, I created a javascript object fixture called codechangedialogfixturecode that I load in place of the data returned from the server.

On the qunit test page this doesnt happen.  The DOM element is still a jstree object, but the element is completely empty.p  pAs the comments in the included code indicate, codehidethrobbercode is called Im testing this using a hrefhttpsinonjs.orgdocsspiesapi relnofollowsinon spiesa and the codeconsole.logcode statement is printed.  No exceptions are raised and no error are indicated.  The failure is completely silent.p  pI thought this may be related to timing somehow, so I made my qunit test a a hrefhttpapi.qunitjs.comasyncTest relnofollowcodeasyncTestcodea and added codestartcode to the callback function passed to codegetJSONcode but this didnt change anything.  I also took a different approach and edited the a hrefhttpsinonjs.orgdocsserver relnofollowcodefakeServercodea with codeserver.autoRespond  truecode, but this didnt fix the problem either.p  pAny suggestions on further tests to run or ideas about what may be causing this are very welcome.

Negative 4963 pI have a Flex Application Im working on with a group. Its a simple travel agency where our data pulled from a URL and stored in an XML object.p  pCurrently we have our application structured with the layout being similar to a webpage. With the application file holding the main look and layout Header container, body container, and footer container. p  pI have other mxml component files which has the contents of the application header component class, page1, etc.. However these pages will need to manipulate the data Ill be taking in.p  pThe basic idea was to load the data in the application after its built and pass a copy of the original xml list to whatever page the user is currently on to modify the copy when they query their search parameters with the Flex XML object class. Essentially starting big All vacation spots and getting more specific Several from the specified parameters chosen.p  pI was thinking of passing the copy with strings Namely .toXMLString and create another XML object with that modified XML String in each page, but not sure on how to pass that string object.p  pHowever Im a bit confused of how to do this since when searching on my own for examples it ranged from creating events, creating an actionscript file that will be global, and people suggesting have a bindable public var in my application. So its a bit confusing. Im not looking for a full blown solution, just something basic I can work on and play around with then implement into this application after I have a good understanding of it.p

Negative 4963 pI have a question regarding DirectX 9, textures and releasing them. Im currently building a 2D game in C.  I have many textures that Im loading with D3DXCreateTextureFromFileEx, and then when moving on from that scene releasing them with TextureRelease which is fine.p  pIve made a class which deals with the games item list.  In it, Im loading textures for each of the items when the class is created, and when the game exits it releases each of those textures.  However, I keep running into a problem.p  pEven though I have already loaded the texture, if I do not draw it, the program will crash when trying to release it.p  pCan anyone explain why this is please I imagine I will need some sort of conditional check to see if the texture has been drawn before I attempt to release itp  pEDITp  pHeres a much watered down version of what I was trying to describe.  This works, but if you comment out the d3dsptDraw line, it fails when releasing the texture.  It appears to only be able to release textures once they have been drawn.  I assumed you would need to release them after youve loaded and finished with them, regardless if they have been drawn or not.  I was just looking for a confirmation, explanation or anything else that might enlighten me. For now, I have added a boolean to each texture to check whether its been drawn or not when I come to releasing it.p  precodeLPDIRECT3DTEXTURE9 Texture  D3DXCreateTextureFromFileExd3ddev,                         LTexture.png,                         D3DXDEFAULT,                         D3DXDEFAULT,                         D3DXDEFAULT,                         NULL,                         D3DFMTA8R8G8B8,                         D3DPOOLMANAGED,                         D3DXDEFAULT,                         D3DXDEFAULT,                         NULL,                         NULL,                         NULL,                         ampTexture  d3ddevgtClear0, NULL, D3DCLEARTARGET, D3DCOLORXRGB0, 0, 0, 1.0f, 0 d3ddevgtBeginScene d3dsptgtBeginD3DXSPRITEALPHABLEND  D3DXVECTOR3 TextureCentre0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f D3DXVECTOR3 TexturePos0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f  d3dsptgtDrawTexture, NULL, ampTextureCentre, ampTexturePos, D3DCOLORARGB255, 25, 255, 255  d3dsptgtEnd d3ddevgtEndScene d3ddevgtPresentNULL, NULL, NULL, NULL  TexturegtRelease codepre

Negative 4963 pI have an application Ive been wanting to build for almost a year now. I studied programming in high school and college BS IT and find it relatively easy. The hard part for me has been the rest of the software development life cycle. They dont seem to teach that as much in school.p  pIm trying to reach as many platforms as possible. I started coding in JavaScript with the intent to use PhoneGap, but local storage seems tedious and I decided to lean more towards application development than web development. Then I started over with Mono and C and it was great fun and easy. Then I discovered the price tag and I cant afford to buy Xamarin. So, I think, I want to try C and Qt. Qt4 and Necessitas currently allow for Android and Qt5 is supposed to include iOS and Android sometime this year plus all the desktops and loads of embedded systems.p  pNow Im struggling with the idea of unit testing. The Nunit tests for C were super easy to learn and run in both Visual Studio and MonoDevelop. C unit testing seems a little tougher, but I want to be Agile and use TDD. Qt Creator, however, as far as I can tell does not support automated unit tests. Eclipse does have automated unit tests with the CUTE plugin, but the Qt designer plugin for Eclipse has been abandoned. That probably wont help for mobile GUI design as Digia is still working in that arena and the old plugin was made by Nokia.p  pI think I want to put all of my code OOP classes in one library, put all of my unit tests in another library or project, and then create another project for the appmainGUI of each platform that I aim to develop for. Im using freeopen licensing, so Id start a project on SourceForge or something using Git. What Im thinking is that I could use Eclipse to write the code and tests. When I need to do some GUI stuff, push the changes, close Eclipse, open Qt Creator, pull the work I just did in Eclipse and then start playing with the GUI.p  pDoes anyone do this Could this work Is this madness Better ideasp  pp.s. stackoverflow is already warning me that this question appears subjective and is likely to be closed. Im not looking to start a debate. Im just wondering if this idea could work and if there is anything else along these lines immediately coming to mind that I have missed.p

Negative 4963 pWhats the recommaned approach to notifying the hosting activity of a fragment that performs some background processing, that its done. Assuming that the fragments are running some threads that are performing work outside of the main looper.p  pA simple callback wont do sincep  ul liThe Activity could be detached due to screen rotation which would lead into a NullPointerException.li liPolling from within the activity is just dumbli liOnly calling the activity once if attached and let the activity check after each onCreate call i.e. due to screen rotation.li liWhat I currently do but it seems wrong Whenever the Fragment gets attached, it will check if the work is done and notify the activity via callback. If the fragment finishes the work it will also callback the activity if attached.li ul  pWhy I think is is wrong Because I have some really ugly methods that check if the fragment is attached and also if the work is done in order to maybe call the callback. This becomes very stupid when an exception is raised during performing some work in the fragment and the activity is detached. If android decides to call onSaveInstance in the same moment I will have to put the Exception into the Bundle and deliver it later when the Activity and fragment is recreated from the saved state. Additionally I can run into a situation where a activity will received the same callback twice once from checking the fragment and the second time when the fragments gets attached this could happen when the application got saved and restoredp  pThis generates so much code that, in my optinion, could be much more clear if activites wont get detached. That is why I hope Im doing something wrong and hope someone will provide me with a better solution.p
Negative 4963 pI am writing my first code in C. The project is a molecular dynamics code simulating particles bouncing around in an infinitely repeating box periodic boundary conditions.

Negative 4963 pI wrote a small script to fetch some data from a website and store it in a file. The data is fetched in a variable content.p  precodetry     content  urllib.urlopenurl.read except     content   codepre  pThe file has a few short phrases, each on a new line. I intend to simply update the last line of the file every time I run the script. And so Im using the following codep  precodetry     f  openMYFILENAME,r                      open file for reading and writing         lines  f.readlines     replaceindex  lenlines[1]                   f.seeklongintf.tellreplaceindex        should move to the start of last line      content[startend] has no n for sure.     f.writecontent[startend]     now  n except Exception as exc     print This is an exception,exc finally     f.close codepre  pNow, I use the crontab to run this script every minute and update MYFILENAME. But the script gives weird behavior strongsometimesstrong,i.e., instead of replacing the last line, it appends a new line to the file. These emsometimesem are usually associated with me restarting the computer or reusing it after putting it on sleep. p  pIf original file wasp  precodexyz abc bla bla bla 1 2 3 codepre  pIm expecting the output to bep  precodexyz abc bla bla bla mynewsmallphrase codepre  pInstead, sometimes I getp  precodexyz abc bla bla bla 1 2 3 mynewsmallphrase codepre  pWhat is wrong with the above code Im using both emcrontabsem and emseek and tellem functions for the first time, so Im not sure about either of them. Or is it something to do with the strongnstrong at the end of write functionp
Negative 4963 pI often heard this question coming from different sources, but never got a good idea of the technologies to achieve this. Can anyone shed some lights The question is you have a website which has high volume of users access per day. Your website is deployed in a distributed manner, have multiple webservers and load balancers responding incoming requests from lots of locations. How do you get the 1000000th user access, and show him a special page saying congrats, you are our 1000000th visitor. Assuming you had a distributed backend.p

Negative 4963 pI have a stored procedure in the database which returns an XML stream, and the application deserializes that stream into its corresponding object. The stored procedure is defined like this I simplified it to make it more readablep  precodeSELECT      usrs.FirstName AS FirstName,     usrs.LastName AS LastName,     usrs.Username AS Username,     usrs.DateJoined AS DateJoined FROM USERS AS usrs WHERE usrs.Username  username FOR XML PATHUserProfile codepre  pNotice that codeUsernamecode is a primary key, so the stored procedure will return only one result. A sample query result would look like thisp  precodeltUserProfilegt   ltFirstNamegtChuckltFirstNamegt   ltLastNamegtNorrisltLastNamegt   ltUsernamegtchuck.awesomeltUsernamegt   ltDateJoinedgt20130722T065800ltDateJoinedgt ltUserProfilegt codepre  pNow in the application, this is how I get and deserialize the datap  precodeinternal static T GetDataltTgtStoredProcedures storedProcedure, ParameterList parameters              using var connection  GetSqlConnection                      using var command  new SqlCommandstoredProcedure.ToString, connection                              command.CommandType  System.Data.CommandType.StoredProcedure                  foreach var parameter in parameters                                      command.Parameters.Addnew SqlParameterparameter.Key.ToString, parameter.Value                                   connection.Open                  var data  command.ExecuteScalar                  return DeserializeXmlltTgtdata.ToString                            codepre  pAnd the codeDeserializeXMLltTgtcode methodp  precodeprivate static T DeserializeXmlltTgtstring xmlStream, Type[] additionalTypes  null              XmlSerializer serializer          if additionalTypes  null                      serializer  new XmlSerializertypeofT                  else                      serializer  new XmlSerializertypeofT, additionalTypes                   using StringReader reader  new StringReaderxmlStream                      return Tserializer.Deserializereader               codepre  pAnd finally the codeUserProfilecode classp  precode[XmlRootUserProfile] [Serializable] public class UserProfile      public UserProfile                [XmlAttributeUsername]     public string Username  get set       [XmlAttributeFirstName]     public string FirstName  get set       [XmlAttributeLastName]     public string LastName  get set       [XmlAttributeDateJoined]     public DateTime DateJoined  get set   codepre  pNow when I run the application, I see that the stored procedure returns the expected value, however, the serializer returns a codeUserProfilecode object with all fields set to codenullcode except for the codeDateJoinedcode field, which is set to the default value since its not nullable. Any idea what could be going wrong I suspect it might be the codeXmlRootcode attribute in the codeUserProfilecode object, but then again the serializer doesnt throw any exception which is why Im confused. Any idea what might be going wrong Thanks in advance.p
Negative 4963 pI have created a form on our website for an online submission of claims for our work. I have two pages associated with the form. I have a back end .php page with a thank you for submission and the code to POST an email to our business address. When the form is filled out, and then submitted, we are not recieving an email. I am pretty new to coding and this is my first attempt at creating a form. I thought I had the necessary code and .php to do this. I would really appreciate any input on how to make this form come through in an email.

Negative 4963 pI got a box running on EC2 with 2 different python scripts that use 2 different SQS queues. My scripts have been working very good for the last week when all of the sudden one of them takes too long to pull messages from an SQS queue. Even when it manages to pull messages it pulls a lot of repeated messages. My 2 scripts use this same methodp  precodedef getMessagesself, n     returns n messages erasing them, mutliple of 10     msgs[]     rsself.queue.getmessages10     if lenrs lt 1         return []     count  0     while count lt n or lenrs lt 10         msgs.extendrs         rsself.queue.getmessages10         count  10      delete pulled messages     for msg in msgs         self.queue.deletemessagemsg      return msgs codepre  pIn this case self.queue is an instance of the followingp  precode    self.conn  SQSConnectionSQSACCESSKEY, SQSSECRETKEY     self.queue  self.conn.getqueuequeuename codepre  pMy script uses the method getMessages the following wayp  precodewhile True     print Getting SQS messages     messages  sqs.getMessages50     print Got s messages  lenmessages      for msg in messages         dosomethingmsg      print Going to sleep     time.sleepsleeptime codepre  pNow, my script just takes too long to pull the messages, it prints codeGetting SQS messagescode and sometimes stays there for hours. What makes it weirder is that if I open an ipython shell and do codegetMessages50code it runs very fast and my other scripts works exactly the same but on a different queue and I have absolutely no problems with that.p  pWhat could possibly be wrong here, thanks. p

Negative 4963 pI will start off by explaining that I have seen many questions and answers regarding this type of feature, but I am still having problems implementing it myself. I am using ARC, and am not using autolayout or storyboard. I define my layouts with constraints in code, so the way I have been trying to implement my animation is a little different. Lastly, this is an iPad application.p  pTo the specific problem at hand, I have a subview that starts off hidden but appears when an action takes place.  I would like this subview to use the hidden feature, but slide in and out after it appears and before it is hidden.  So far, I have gotten halfway there and am able to get the view to slide in without issue. Below is the code that accomplishes this.p  precode    detailView.hidden  NO   Perform Animation  Slide In     CABasicAnimation animation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathtransform]     animation.duration  kAnimationTimeout     animation.removedOnCompletion  NO     animation.fromValue  [NSValue valueWithCATransform3DCATransform3DMakeTranslation800.0, 0.0, 1.0]     [detailView.layer addAnimationanimation forKeynil] codepre  pHowever, I have been unsuccessful with trying getting the view to slide out before it is hidden. Below is the code that I added to attempt at completing this feature. p  precode Perform Animation  Slide Out     CABasicAnimation animation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathtransform]     animation.duration  kAnimationTimeout     animation.removedOnCompletion  NO     animation.toValue  [NSValue valueWithCATransform3DCATransform3DMakeTranslation800.0, 0.0, 1.0]     [detailView.layer addAnimationanimation forKeynil]      detailView.hidden  YES codepre  pThe result I get is that the view simply disappears like it was hidden, which it always did. Do I need to remove one animation that is added to a view before I add a different animation Or is my CATransform3DMakeTranslation incorrectly definedp

Negative 4963 pI have an existing database that Im using code first with. I did some cleanup on the tables in my SQL database to make sure I have foreign keys where needed. I have one table called InventoryBase that has a nullable foreign key called ClientID that points to a table called EntityCompany. InventoryBase maps to my entity object called ComputerEntity, and EntityCompany maps to my entity object called CompanyEntity. I believe I have the navigation props set correctly, but please let me know if I goofed. The issue I am having is that the CompanyEntity navigation property is never loaded. I tried removing the navigation properties on both so I could look at the value of the ClientID in the ComputerEntity object, but it is never loaded even though that column exists in the database I suspect that EF conventions are seeing the word ID and doing some black magic with it.p  pI have my ComputerEntity defined as such, and I really really want the CompanyEntity to loadp  precode[TableInventoryBase] public class ComputerEntity       primary key     [Key]     public int AssetID  get set        foreign keys     [ForeignKeyCompanyEntity]     public int ClientID  get set        navigation props     [ForeignKeyClientID]     public virtual CompanyEntity CompanyEntity  get set        these props are fine without custom mapping     public string Hostname  get set      public string ServiceTag  get set   codepre  pThis is my fabled CompanyEntity that never loadsp  precode[TableEntityCompany] public class CompanyEntity      protected CompanyEntity        primary key     [Key]     public int ClientID  get set        foreign key       nav props     public virtual ICollectionltComputerEntitygt ComputerEntities  get set        regular props       custom mappings     [ColumnCompanyName, TypeName  nvarcharMAX]     public string Name  get set       [ColumnFQDN, TypeName  nvarcharMAX]     public string Domain  get set   codepre  pI am trying to find a computer where its hostname property matches an input, and the computer belongs to a particular company. I have a DbSet that I am querying and assuming that since navigation properties are present it can reach out to the associated CompanyEntity objects properties. So far I have assumed wrong and for the life of me cant see what is causing the problem. Here is how I am trying to fetch a computerp  precode    public ComputerEntity FindComputerByHostnamestring hostname, string client              var computer  DbSet.Wherex gt x.Hostname  hostname ampamp x.CompanyEntity.Name  client.FirstOrDefault  lt always null         var test  DbSet.Wherex.CompanyEntity.Name  client.ToList  lt never finds anything, which is why I suspect a nonworking relationship         return computer       codepre  pAnother bit of strangeness is that in my ComputerEntity I have to make the ClientID nullable with the int otherwise I get an exception that ClientID cannot be null. When I looked at the database, the column is nullable but there are no null values in it. Weird. Is the fact that is an int breaking the relationship somehowp  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr So I reverse engineered using the EF power tool to try and get more detail. It gave me all my ugly table names as entities, which is fine. CompanyEntity is now EntityCompany, and it has the ICollections for all the things that refer to it. ComputerEntity is now InventoryBase, and I have the same issue where it is never loaded. To add to the riddle, CompanyEntity now EntityCompanys other collections DO navigate as expected I checked out the mapping files that were autogenerated, and the busted collections all have .IsRequired for every property. The collections that do work normally dont have this. Also, the busted collections all have their ClientID is int and not a regular nonnullable int. Although I dont know why, I think this is a problem. Focusing on the problem at hand between companies and their respective computers, the ComputerEntity now InventoryBase has the dreaded int in the autogenerated mapping file. I checked the SQL database with a SELECT  FROM InventoryBase WHERE ClientID IS NULL, and I get nothing. I try to modify the table to make the ClientID column nonnullable, and SQL complains that it cant do it because the table cant be recreated. Normally I would expect this is there was a null value in there... but there isnt. I can modify my other tables that correspond to entity collections that play nicely already without issue. Maybe the issue is a corrupted SQL table I didnt think that was possible, but if someone knows a DBCC command to check that would be great. To keep my solution consistent with this question, I reverted my changes and am back to using my hand coded ComputerEntity and CompanyEntity as defined in this question.p  pInside of ComputerEntity I changedp  precode[ForeignKeyCompanyEntity] public int ClientID getset codepre  ptop  precode[ForeignKeyCompanyEntity] public int ClientID getset codepre  pNow when I test I get an an exception ofbr The navigation property ClientID is not a declared property on type ComputerEntity.

Negative 4963 pi am facing with a very difficult problem, which is followingp  pI have a number of HTMLformatted Strings. they were generated by a DocumentElement, where the text was edited in RTF and saved in HTML to display it on a website.p  pthe problem now is, that some RTFElements which are parset to HTML seems to be unusable in html, which leads it to crash. One of the in html disallowed chars is e.g. the strong0bstrongp  paccording to a hrefhttpwww.tutorialspoint.comhtmlhtmlurlencoding.htm relnofollowhttpwww.tutorialspoint.comhtmlhtmlurlencoding.htma it has no function, or i cant figure out why it is needed in fact, it isnt even copyable.p  pMy question now is Is there a function out there I already searched which is able to eliminate all nonhtml characters of such a formatted rtf2htmlstringp  pI just need to eliminate them when the html is loaded, so there arent any display problemsp

Negative 4963 pI am following the instruction from the link a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comadwordsapidocsfirstrequest relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comadwordsapidocsfirstrequesta here. But I am stuck in the first step itself. In python the documentation states to authenticate use the snippet p  precodefrom adspygoogle.adwords.AdWordsClient import AdWordsClient from adspygoogle.common import Utils client  AdWordsClientpathos.path.join.., .., .., .. codepre  pWhere I think the path contains codeclientsecrets.jsoncode. The file codeclientsecrets.jsoncode  exists in my location yet I get p  precodeValidationError Authentication data is missing. codepre  pAny pointers would be greatly appreciated. The only problem I can think of is that I may also require developer token with it but how do I get the developer token, it doesnt exist at my MCC path also how would I use the developer token, what filename to use for storing the file.p
Negative 4963 pIn my c class, everything was working fine. My view model properties were exposed correctly.p  pIf I called upon one of the properties in the class I was exposing, lets say id or type, they came out in the emulator fine... if however I tried to access title, it would not work.p  pSo I thought, maybe some dodgy data, but I couldnt find any... at a last ditch attempt I called title attribute floppydoodlewoodle for lack of a better name and in my xaml, updated the binding. It worked... p  pDoes this sound right Some pre taken property name Or is there something else a bit dodgy going on herep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe question was simply if the word title as a property is allowed in xaml, but here is the xaml if you really must see it.p  precode    ltDataTemplate xKeyActivityStreamItemTemplategt         ltStackPanel VerticalAlignmentTop Margin5,0,0,0gt                         ltTextBlock TextBinding ttitle HorizontalAlignmentLeft FontSize30 VerticalAlignmentCenter Margin0,0,0,5 ForegroundWhite gt         ltStackPanelgt     ltDataTemplategt codepre  pNotice I have Binding ttitle, I had to change it and the backing data from title to ttitle to make it work rather than floppydoodlewoodle as previously suggested hehe.p  pI hope this clarifies things... Its just weird that title doesnt pick up, but using the same data and changing it to ttitle allows it to appear... so I assumed it was just a reserved name in xaml but then again, its annoying so I thought I best ask.p  pThe other thought was that xaml was having ambiguity issues between other properties... but im struggling to see how considering im calling this template like sop  precode            ltphoneLongListSelector xNameActivityStreamList                                     BackgroundTransparent                                     ItemTemplateStaticResource ActivityStreamItemTemplate                                      ItemsSourceBinding ActivityStream                                      Margin40,0,0,96                                      LayoutModeList                                     HideEmptyGroupsTrue                                     IsGroupingEnabledTruegt              ltphoneLongListSelectorgt codepre  pHere is the relevant ViewModel section. strongstrong is just privacy for this post  AlphaKeyGroup  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsphonedevelopjj244365vvs.105.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsphonedevelopjj244365vvs.105.aspxap  precodeprivate async void LoadActivityStreamSection              activityStreamRepository  new StreamRepository         var tempActivityStream  await activityStreamRepository.GetAllBySpaceIdspace.spaceid          ListltAlphaKeyGroupltStreamgtgt groupedActivityStream  AlphaKeyGroupltStreamgt.CreateGroupstempActivityStream,             System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture,             Stream a gt  return a.ttitle , true          activityStream  tempActivityStream         activityStream  groupedActivityStream         ActivityStream  null          LoadBar loadBar  new LoadBarLogging in         loadBar.ShowLoadBarthis      codepre

I know you can use the data attribute now in HTML5 but this must work in older IE versions i use XHTML strict. I do this for several reasonsp  ul lipIt is fast, scan DOM only oncepli lipScalability, when rel attribute with a specific name does not exist in the html, the  associated function will never be executedpli lipCompact, all functions can be fitted into one single file without conflicts and it is very clean and clearpli lipCan be used with dynamic stuff ajax, dialogs, functionality can be automatic bind when new html is loaded without the need to design a specific function because it is already specified in the rel attribute.pli lipStability, if a function does not exist or rel attribute does not exist, code will not break.pli ul  pI use this technique for several years now with jQuery and it is very handy, i call it AjaxQuery for examplep  precode  Extend the ajaxquery class TAjaxQuery.prototype.setupPage  function  Will be called automaticly   var o  this  o.onAjaxFoundRelAttrMlink  function oSender, oData   Called when relmlink is found     oData.target     Target element    oData.rel.mlink  parsed rel attribute   oData.target.bind click, functione  i know this is jquery         do something         ..... etc    codepre  pThe resources can be dialogs so functionality must be only binded when visible. Thats the reason links with a rel attribute in a resource must be NOT binded at startup. A dialog is a dynamic thing. Thats why codenot.resources a[rel]code is in the searchquery.p  pIll hope you get the idea.  p

Negative 4963 pI am trying to make a small physics game to understand box2dweb better. I want the game to be able to detect when a certain shape, is in contact with a certain sensor or body.

Negative 4963 pI created some views as dimensions and fact. I set up proactive caching on measures hoping to see the update on measures automatically. In storage settings, I set up Automatically MOLAP for the partition just one partition for the measure group and in the Options, set Silence interval and Silence override interval to 10 seconds and 10 minutes respectively. Also checked Bring online immediately and Enable ROLAP aggregations. In the notification tab, I specified tracking table SQL Server as the fact view.p  pI deployed project. But when I manually add or delete a row in the underlying table of the fact view, there is no update in the cube browser after refreshing. p  pTo prove this, I create another project with all the same dimensions and facts, except instead using views I used actual tables. With all the same proactive caching, this time I am able to see the changes adddelete rows from fact table after refreshing in the cube browser.p  pSo anyone can explain this Thanks.p

Negative 4963 pIm having trouble getting started with building a Print Monitor  Print Handler for Windows using Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate with WDK 8. Basically, this is what I am trying to accomplishp  ul liCreate a print monitor something an application can print to that will generate a file with the content that should be printed like the default XPS printer or a PDF printer, and then invokes the print handlerli liCreate a print handler that will parse the generated file and do certain actions with it check to see if certain text is present, upload the file online, etcli ul  pI feel like the print handler part should not be too hard, but starting with the print monitor is what Im stuck at. What would I do within VS12 I see options for Printer Driver V4, Printer Driver V4 Property Bag, and Printer XPS Render Filter. Should I use one of those templates, and, if so, what would I do within them Anything pointing me in the right direction would be appreciatedp  pemEDITemp  pJust some more clarification  I only need the text from the print output, but Ive read from various sources that getting textonly output leads to no output at all from sources like Firefox, etc since they print text as glyphs.p  pI will be using the print handler to parse the text for keywords and then upload that information to a web server in a specific format. The print monitor just needs to capture and save the text information from whatever application is printing.p

Negative 4963 pI am working on a chess game and right now I am making a method to check from the king, in a direction and returns true if a threat is found, false if no threat is found. This method takes in two ints to increase x and y by. And this method will from the starting location, in the direction given  1,0 for up, 1,1 for upampright, 0,1 for down. p  pMy problem is, this method checks the path with a for loop, which will eventually hit the border of the chess game, and find a barrier, or it will find a piece. Either way, that is how the for loop should end. But then what condition would go in the for loop  I feel like it might be bad practice to just leave it out, but then the only logical condition would be to make sure x and y are both in the range of 18. But that would leave the code looking like  codeforint i  begx  xdiff, j  begy  ydiff i lt 8 ampamp i gt 1 ampamp j lt 8 ampamp j gt 1 i  xdiff, j  ydiff  .. codep  pThis would be the only other option I see, and this in itself seems like bad practice to me also. Because, it looks over complicated and crammed together. And this condition should never be broken, so why would I have it in there if it would never be the reason the loop broke I dont want other programmers to read my code and think this might be something they have to look out for, when really, I just didnt need a condition there and put it in for double checking.p  pThis is the whole method, for referencep  precodepublic boolean incheckPathLocation l1, int xdiff, int ydiff      int begx  l1.getX     int begy  l1.getY      String team  board[begx][begy].getTeam      forint i  begx  xdiff, j  begy  ydiff  i  xdiff, j  ydiff          ifboard[i][j].getType                  ifboard[i][j].getType                    return false                          ifboard[i][j].getTeam.equalsteam                  return false                          ifboard[i][j].getType  Q  board[i][j].getType  R                  return true                               codepre  pstrongEDITstrong It has been improved to implement a while loop, but now how could this be improved any Someone suggested using break and continue so I implemented that where I saw it could be.

Slowness is an issue Ive fought with over the VPN forever, but I had a thought in this case that may potentially aleve the slowness, I judt want to know if Im correct before I go to the trouble of recoding everything.p  pMy idea is that I could create an array in VBA that would be populated with the agents name amp IDs when the form first loads, or even when the DB is opened on each inidividual laptop.  Then the DB would only need to read from the AllAgents table once, and could simply use the array as a source instead.  What I doint know is if this would have an effect or not.  Basically, if an Access DB is saved onto a network drive and accessed over a VPN, would the array be stored in the RAM of the laptop  If it is, I would assume this would alleviate the speed issues and would be worthwhile taking the time to recode.p  pThanks,p

Negative 4963 pIm working on an MFC DLL which is used as a plugin inside a Delphi application. The Delphi application calls the DLL and inside this call I open an modal MFC dialog. Everything works fine except that there is a redraw problem. The dialog appears normally but when I move the dialog the controls inside the dialog disappear. The DLL itself was created by VS so the MFC application object is present and the InitInstance is called before the normal DLL call from the Delphi application. So, in the moment Ive got no idea how I can fix this problem. p  pThanks in advance Martinp

Negative 4963 pI am taking a stab at writing a fluent API in C. What I am trying to do is make a builder that can set some properties. The properties can be set in any order, and all of them are optional. After a property is already set, it makes little sense to still show the method that sets it in intellisense, so I would like to hide it if it is already set. Here is an example of the type of API I would like with just 3 properties.p  precodepublic interface ISoldier      string Name  get set      string Rank  get set      int SerialNumber  get set    public interface ISoldierBuilder      IInterrogationStarter InterrogateSoldier   public interface IInterrogationEnder      ISoldier FinishInterrogation    No properties set 3 that can still be set public interface IInterrogationStarter  IInterrogationEnder      IBuilderWithNameSet WithNamestring value     IBuilderWithRankSet WithRankstring value     IBuilderWithSerialNumberSet WithSerialNumberint value    One property set 2 that can still be set public interface IBuilderWithNameSet  IInterrogationEnder      IBuilderWithNameAndRankSet WithRankstring value     IBuilderWithNameAndSerialNumberSet WithSerialNumberint value   public interface IBuilderWithRankSet  IInterrogationEnder      IBuilderWithNameAndRankSet WithNamestring value     IBuilderWithRankAndSerialNumberSet WithSerialNumberint value   public interface IBuilderWithSerialNumberSet  IInterrogationEnder      IBuilderWithNameAndSerialNumberSet WithNamestring value     IBuilderWithRankAndSerialNumberSet WithRankstring value    Two properties set 1 that can still be set public interface IBuilderWithNameAndRankSet  IInterrogationEnder      IInterrogationEnder WithSerialNumberint value   public interface IBuilderWithNameAndSerialNumberSet  IInterrogationEnder      IInterrogationEnder WithRankstring value   public interface IBuilderWithRankAndSerialNumberSet  IInterrogationEnder      IInterrogationEnder WithNamestring value  codepre  pI left off the implementation because it isnt required to demonstrate what I am trying to do. Now, if you actually copy this code into a project you can see what I am trying to do. Once a property is set, it is no longer available in the list in intellisense.p  precodeISoldierBuilder builder  ISoldier soldier1  builder.InterrogateSoldier     .WithNameBob     .WithRankCorporal     .FinishInterrogation  ISoldier soldier2  builder.InterrogateSoldier     .WithSerialNumber12345     .FinishInterrogation  ISoldier soldier3  builder.InterrogateSoldier     .WithRankCaptain     .WithSerialNumber55533     .WithNameJohn     .FinishInterrogation codepre  pFor example, with soldier1, once we call .WithNameBob.WithRankCorporal, all that is left in the available choices arep  precodeWithSerialNumber FinishInterrogation codepre  pSetting the name again would just be confusing  which one is the actual name we need to put into the ISoldier instancep  pNow imagine trying to expand this simple example to 10 properties. My question is  how can I make my optional properties disappear from intellisense after they are set without creating a huge number of interfaces that grow exponentially with the number of propertiesp  pstrongMore Contextstrongp  pThe goals of the fluent API are to make it easier to write, easier to read, and to enforce business rules. If we havent accomplished those, then there is little point in creating a fluent API.p  pstrongThe Long Storystrongp  pIn my research, I discovered that the definition of a fluent interface is one where the words flow together into a sentence and can be spoken aloud. However, in practice true fluent APIs are quite rare because of the amount of extra work they require to implement. A typical compromise is to make one that is easily readable, but doesnt necessarily make sense to speak aloud.p  pI would like to go a little bit beyond that because in my own experience with existing fluent API implementations  I find that they are usually difficult to use and require quite a bit of research to learn how to configure. So I am adding an additional constraint that the API must be as easy to work with  preferably by discovering the available options using intellisense.p  pAlso, I discovered that one of the most compelling reasons to use a fluent API is the ability to enforce some business rules at the compiler level. I read a hrefhttpvisualstudiomagazine.comArticles20131201BestPracticesforDesigningaFluentAPI.aspxPage1 relnofollowsomea a hrefhttpvisualstudiomagazine.comarticles20140101strategiesandcodeforcreatingfluentapis.aspx relnofollowgreata a hrefhttpvisualstudiomagazine.comarticles20131101whentobuildfluentinterfacesforreuseandclarity.aspx relnofollowarticlesa by Peter Vogel that go into some details about how to enforce business rules and used some of these techniques to enforce a hrefhttpsgithub.comNightOwl888MvcSiteMapProviderFluentApiDemo1blobmastersrcMvcSiteMapProviderFluentApiDemo1ReadMe.txt relnofollow13 of the business rulesa I need for my application in a way that wont compile unless the rules are followed. This is the best argument yet for using a fluent API, as just making an API that is readable is nothing more than syntactic sugar, but ensuring business rules are enforced is a much more practical and functional use.p  pFurthermore, readability is subjective and depends on who you anticipate to read the API. I am willing to make a few compromises here because the intended audience are developers.p  pThe back story is that I have already implemented a a hrefhttpsgithub.comNightOwl888MvcSiteMapProviderFluentApiDemo1blobmastersrcMvcSiteMapProviderFluentApiDemo1FluentSiteMapNodeProvidersSemanticSiteMapNodeProvider.cs relnofollownonfunctional prototypea that enforces several of the business rules I have, as well as changes properties depending on their context because they are used differently when the context changes. I am hoping there is some way to use generics, attributes, or some other compiler magic to solve this one extra business rule without having to make dozens of extra interfaces to support it, and then have to change all of those interfaces when a new property is added.p  pThe fluent API is also going to be an alternative to XML for semantically marking up a hierarchy of objects, which is yet another compelling argument for its usage. Some of the business rules which havent yet been implemented deal with property inheritance from parent objects to their descendant objects.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comNightOwl888MvcSiteMapProviderFluentApiDemo1blobmastersrcMvcSiteMapProviderFluentApiDemo1FluentSiteMapNodeProvidersDynamicSiteMapNodeProvider.cs relnofollowUsing the prototype to load data from a dynamic data sourceap

Negative 4963 pIm pretty new to jQuery so Im probably doing something really wrong but the next and buck link buttons I made fail to trip the largeImage img.attrsrc, picturelist[ activeindex ]  script I placed into their .click functions.  Instead the result is that the largeImage div ends up being hidden again.  Ive tried everything from adding a .preventDefault to the script to ensure that the links which have no target arent trying to randomly go elsewhere.  Ive also output most my  variables to ensure that they are in fact being set properly within the html code.  From all that Ive read about the .attr function this script should be working.

Negative 4963 pI am creating a little application that receives battery data through the BatteryManager and when battery level gets 100 it emits a sound to the user every 5 seconds to let him know battery is fully charged.p  pThe problem is that when application gets paused the thread emitting the sound stops too. Is there any way to keep this thread alive I have been reading about services too but dont know if this is suitable for such a simple thing. Using a service I suppose I could track the battery level there and emit the sound in the service. p  pCould anyone comment a good way to achieve thisp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4963 pI have an emberrails application with three main templates, Home, Contacts, and Payments.  Both the contacts and payments templates need an array of contacts.  This array needs to be populated from an external api.  Currently, for the contacts every time I am going to this template the external api is being hit.  Ideally I would like to hit the api asynchronously when a user first signs in, grabs this data once and can refer back to it without hitting the external api until necessary.p  pWith rails I could easily just add hasone contactslist for user with a postgres json column  and when switching the templates conditionally refresh this whenever needed.  I am curious as to the best way to deal with this problem in ember.p

User should enter the value in eform than it should redirect to sprint. eform should be in hold because eformid is foreign key in sprint.similarly after filling sprints by user controller should redirect to effort.

Negative 4963 pI met a very strange issue when writing test using RSpec. Assume that I have 2 models Company and Item with association company hasmany items. I also set up databasecleaner with strategy transaction. My RSpec version is 2.13.0, databasecleaner version is 1.0.1, rails version is 3.2.15, factorygirl version is 4.2.0. Here is my testp  precodeletcompany  RSpec.configuration.company  context has accounts do   it returns true do     company.items ltlt FactoryGirl.createitem     company.items.count.should gt 0   end end context does not have accounts do   it returns false do     company.items.count.should  0   end end codepre  pendp  pI set up an initial company to rspec configuration for using in every test because I dont want to recreate it in every tests because creating a company takes a lot of timedue to its callbacks and validations. The second test fails because item is not cleaned from the database after the first test. I dont understand why. If I change line codecompany.items ltlt FactoryGirl.createitemcode to codeFactoryGirl.createitem, company companycode, the it passes. So can any body explain for me why transaction isnt rollbacked in the first situation. Im really messed upp  pThanks. I really appreciate.p

Negative 4963 pIm using libGDX trying to make a topdown 2D game with movement along the lines of Pokemon.  However, Im not sure how to implement this.  I want the player to be able to press a key ie arrow keys or WASD in order to move, however, when the player releases the key, I dont want the character to stop moving until its position falls along a grid of cells that consist of 32x32 pixel squares.  So how would I go about creating an invisible grid of 32x32 pixel cells and making my character only stop moving whenever its on top of one of those cellsp  pSo far Ive only done bypixel movement.

Negative 4963 pIm thinking about writing a custom Asio service on top of an existing proprietary 3rd party networking protocol that we  are currently using. p  pAccording to a hrefhttpen.highscore.decppboostasio.htmlasioextensionsHighscore Asio guidea you need to implement three classes to create a custom Asio servicep  ul liA class derived from codeboostasiobasicioobjectcode representing the new IO object.li liA class derived from codeboostasioioserviceservicecode representing a service that is registered with the IO service and can be accessed from the IO object.li liA class not derived from any other class representing the service implementation.li ul  pThe network protocol implementation already provides asynchronous operations and has a blocking eventloop. So I thought, I would put it into my service implementation class and run the eventloop in an internal worker thread. So far so good.p  pLooking at some examples of custom services, I noticed that the service classes spawn their own internal threads in fact they instantiate their own internal ioservice instances. For examplep  ol lipThe Highscore page provides a a hrefhttpwww.highscore.deboostdirmonitor.zipdirectory monitor examplea. It is essentially a wrapper around inotify. The interesting classes are codeinotifybasicdirmonitorservice.hppcode and codeinotifydirmonitorimpl.hppcode. codeDirmonitorimplcode handles the actual interaction with inofity, which is blocking, and therefore runs in a background thread. I agree with that. But the codebasicdirmonitorservicecode also has an internal worker thread and all that seems to be doing is shuffling requests between mains codeioservicecode and the codedirmonitorimplcode. I played around with the code, removed the worker thread in codebasicdirmonitorservicecode and instead posted requests directly to the main ioservice and the program still ran as before.pli lipIn Asios a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550dochtmlboostasioexamplescpp03examples.htmlboostasio.examples.cpp03examples.servicescustom logger service examplea, Ive noticed the same approach. The a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550dochtmlboostasioexamplecpp03servicesloggerservice.hppcodeloggerservicecodea spawns an internal worker thread to handle the logging requests. I havent had time to play around with that code, but I think, it should be possible to post these requests directly to the main ioservice as well.pli ol  pWhat is the advantage of having these intermediary workers Couldnt you post all work to the main ioservice all the time Did I miss some crucial aspect of the Proactor patternp  pI should probably mention that Im writing software for an underpowered singlecore embedded system. Having these additional threads in place just seems to impose unnecessary context switches which Id like to avoid if possible.p

Negative 4963 pWe have got an existing InstallShield InstallScript MSI install project that we are trying to modify in order to make it so we can give a customer an install that will only work with their specific serial number for use with our new automated check for updates feature. We already have a mechanism in place that evaluates a customers serial number and other credentials at install time that were hoping to be able to still use.  Right now the best idea Ive got is to hash or otherwise obfuscate the users credentials in a file and insert the file into a zip of the installer package MSI, CAB files, InstallShield specific files, etc that the installer can later consume at runtime.  This however seems rather hokey to me.  Is there a better way of achieving the same goalp  pEDIT So what we are going to wind up doing is encrypting the set of credentials that this install is only supposed to work for, and then including that in the update installer that gets distributed.  The installer will then unencrypt the credentials for use during install so we can check that the user trying to install the software is the user we want to install the software.p

Each point is guaranteed to have a unique index, and the grid is guaranteed to have a contiguous set of indices in this case, 1 through to 18 but the order is not guaranteed in any way. The dimensions of the grid are not known beforehand. Each point will only ever have a valance of 2 corner point, 3 edge point, or 4 point somewhere in the centre.p  pNow, Ive written a brute force approach to this, but its fairly inefficient. It consists of figuring out the first two horizontal and vertical edges in this case, [1, 5, 3, 6, 4, 2] and [1, 9, 13], then shifting each edge over by getting the connected neighbours of each point and subtracting an already visited set from that so 1  5, 9  8, 13  18 and repeating this process until you hit the other side of the grid.p  pWhat I was wondering was if there was a more pythonic way of handling this. My own code is split up into several different phases, but I figured theres got to be some way of doing this in one fell swoop rather then iterating over everything so many times its currently taking me about 60ms per run to figure all this out, and Im trying to get that down to 20ms if possible.p

Negative 4963 pAre there any tools or methods for renaming a DLLs dependenciesp  pIm working with a large program that uses a significant number of third party dependencies. Im able to compile nearly all of these dependencies into DLLs with a specific naming convention i.e. libSomethingx86.dll. However, there is one dependency FFmpeg that I cant easily compile, but precompiled DLLs are available. So far, Ive renamed the DLL files and recreated the import libraries to use the new names. My application compiles, but fails to run because FFmpeg is composed of multiple DLLs and they reference each other with the original names. Since the new DLL names are longer than the original DLL names, I cant simply hex edit the DLL files. I cant use sidebyside redirection, manifest tricks, or wrapperdummy DLLs because the fact the DLLs are precompiled and renamed must be completely transparent to the other application developers.p  pI was hoping to find a method of unlinking the DLL, editing the dependency list, and then relinking the DLL. Is this possiblep  pThank you.p

Negative 4963 pIm a trying to deploy my application using Docker and came across an issue that restarting named containers assigns a different IP to container. Maybe explaining what I am doing will better explain the issuep  ul liPostgres runs inside a separate container named codepostgrescodebr code PGIDdocker run name postgres postgresimagecode  li liMy webapp container links to postgres containerbr code APPIDdocker run link postgrespostgres webappimagecodeli ul  pLinking postgres container image to webapp container inserts in webapp container a hosts file entry with the IP of the postgres container. This allows me to point to postgres db  within my webapp using codepostgres5432code I am using Django btw. This all works well except if for some reason postgres crashes.p  pBefore I manually stop postgres process to simulate postgres process crashing I verify IP of postgres containerp  precode docker inspect format .NetworkSettings.IPAddress PGID 172.17.0.73 codepre  pNow to simulate crash I stop postgres containerp  precode docker stop PGID codepre  pIf now I restart postgres by usingp  precode docker start PGID codepre  pthe ip of the container changesp  precode docker inspect format .NetworkSettings.IPAddress PGID 172.17.0.74 codepre  pTherefore the IP which points to postgres container in webapp container is no longer correct. I though that by naming container docker assigns a name to it with specific configs so that you can reliably link between containers both network and volumes. If the IP changes this seems to defeat the purpose.p  pIf I have to restart my webapp process each time I postgres restarts, this does not seem any better than just using a single container to run both processes. Then I can use supervisor or something similar to keep both of them running and use codelocalhostcode to link between processes.p  pI am still new to Docker so am I doing something wrong or is this a bug in dockerp

Negative 4963 pWe have a company that designed our website and we have pay pal standard set up to take payments.  It works great except for theres times where there is a double order because the notifications from paypal go to one sales person and another sales guy handles the website orders.  The notifications could be from more than just the website so the sales guy doesnt think anything of it when putting in the order and the notification however doesnt update on our website if the order is filed by that sales person and vis versa.  Also we run into the issue of the shipping and billing addresses being different and matching them since the website shows who its going to as the main name and the pay pal will show the billing name.  Any suggestions on what we can do to make it easier on our sales teamp

Negative 4963 pThis list has a codepadding 0 marginleft 10pxcode. Bullet points work fine, appearing in the left margin. However, when I add codeheight 800px overflowy hiddencode, the bullet points suddenly disappear. Why I can see no reason why codeoverflowycode should affect anything appearing in the left margin of an element.p  pIn the example below, the additional rules are applied with javascript, but this is not relevant except to illustrate the endgoal of the exercise. The same happens if I apply them directly.p  pSearching for this finds me many examples of bullet points disappearing with codeoverflow hiddencode, which is understandable, but I am unable to see why any of these problems apply to codeoverflowycode, nor am I able to find anyone else experiencing this problem.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt ltmeta charsetUTF8gt lttitlegtTest Listlttitlegt ltscript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.9.0jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.10.3jqueryui.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltlink relstylesheet hrefajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.8.16themesuidarknessjqueryui.css typetextcss mediaallgt  ltstylegt .highlights      marginleft 10px     width 500px     padding 0  ltstylegt  ltscriptgt document.ready     function          var h  ul.highlights         if h.height gt 800              h.cssoverflowy, hidden             h.cssheight, 800px             var expand  document.createElementspan             expand.innerHTML  Show all             h.afterexpand             expand.click                 function                      h.hide.cssheight, auto.slideDown                     this.hide                                              ltscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltul classhighlightsgt ltligtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.ltligt ltligtDuis luctus ex neque, quis lobortis dui efficitur ac.ltligt ltligtIn ornare iaculis sapien, id faucibus erat vestibulum sit amet.ltligt ltligtSuspendisse odio erat, suscipit vel sem et, gravida pretium felis.ltligt ltligtVestibulum finibus ex lacus, sit amet bibendum nunc auctor efficitur.ltligt ltligtDonec in diam imperdiet, posuere velit sed, auctor nulla.ltligt ltligtDuis at lorem arcu.ltligt ltligtMaecenas in velit id magna congue commodo.ltligt ltligtInteger congue nunc hendrerit, lobortis ligula at, finibus tortor.ltligt ltligtDonec euismod, tellus ut sollicitudin consequat, elit nulla imperdiet dui, eu aliquet odio magna id felis.ltligt ltligtIn varius a turpis eu ornare.ltligt ltligtProin eu pharetra felis.ltligt ltligtNunc tempus odio lectus, non molestie eros facilisis aliquet.ltligt ltligtAenean magna urna, ultricies ac faucibus sit amet, viverra ut ante.ltligt ltligtProin ornare lacinia nisi vitae aliquam.ltligt ltligtMorbi at enim ut erat tempor hendrerit.ltligt ltligtDonec suscipit id massa feugiat placerat.ltligt ltligtAliquam luctus maximus lectus, id rutrum ligula tincidunt vel.ltligt ltligtSed vehicula tellus in nunc sagittis vulputate.ltligt ltligtInteger bibendum quam sit amet lacinia dignissim.ltligt ltligtEtiam ultricies ultricies nibh elementum fermentum.ltligt ltligtUt vitae risus lectus.ltligt ltligtMauris ac convallis sapien, quis euismod arcu.ltligt ltligtVestibulum viverra erat a lacinia molestie.ltligt ltligtFusce et turpis molestie, pretium ex varius, consectetur orci.ltligt ltligtCurabitur eu diam in tellus tempus pretium.ltligt ltligtIn accumsan tortor nec congue placerat.ltligt ltligtDuis laoreet rhoncus libero eget posuere.ltligt ltligtIn lacinia, dolor sed fringilla ultrices, diam eros pulvinar ligula, non maximus enim orci vel diam.ltligt ltligtPraesent sollicitudin libero augue, nec pretium mauris luctus id.ltligt ltligtProin id turpis auctor, lacinia nunc et, pretium orci.ltligt ltligtNulla vel eleifend leo, sed fringilla ligula.ltligt ltligtMaecenas convallis arcu ac gravida ornare.ltligt ltligtVestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae Nulla malesuada dui et urna vulputate pharetra.ltligt ltligtMaecenas eu dictum orci.ltligt ltligtMorbi auctor finibus pretium.ltligt ltligtNam consequat luctus vehicula.ltligt ltligtPhasellus eu arcu sed ipsum ultricies mollis.ltligt ltligtEtiam at porttitor est.ltligt ltligtNulla pellentesque pretium tempus.ltligt ltligtCras molestie pharetra sem eu iaculis.ltligt ltligtNam consequat, arcu id tincidunt pretium, sem ipsum interdum est, non pellentesque felis eros sit amet lectus.ltligt ltligtNulla laoreet congue elit, non aliquam orci rutrum a.ltligt ltligtAenean fringilla consequat nisi, tempus dictum libero finibus sed.ltligt ltligtSuspendisse eget ligula quam.ltligt ltligtNulla in ornare turpis.ltligt ltligtDonec sit amet eros at tortor fermentum aliquet.ltligt ltligtEtiam semper eleifend ante non vehicula.ltligt ltligtSed id diam erat.ltligt ltligtPellentesque laoreet gravida finibus.ltligt ltligtVivamus maximus ornare mi, ut gravida leo tincidunt vel.ltligt ltligtMauris congue laoreet imperdiet.ltligt ltligtIn hac habitasse platea dictumst.ltligt ltulgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 4963 pI created an addin for PowerPoint using VSTO 2013 without using Addin Express ,custom task pane and a custom control.p  pIn the addin startup, I am adding the custom control to custom task pane and this task pane is invoked.p  pwhen the PowerPoint application opens, I am able to see Custom Task Pane with Custom control Button.p  pNow when I try to drag and drop the custom control button from custom task pane to PowerPoint slide, it is not working.p  pPlease help me how to handle drag and drop events for the custom controls by providing some sample codes.p  pThank you.p
Negative 4963 pIn my app, there is an codeMainActivitycode and an codeAlarmActivitycode. codeMainActivitycode is used to set an alarm. codeAlarmActivitycode is used to show the alarm. In the middle, I have a class that implements codeBroadcastReceivercode, to receive the pending intent that was scheduled in codeMainActivitycode. The issue Im having is two fold.p  p1 codeMainActivitycode is being created when Im only expecting codeAlarmActivitycode to be created from the onReceive method seen below.p  p2When codeAlarmActivitycode does get created, it is destroyed right afterwards. Please see my logs below.p  pPlease note, this ONLY happens when I turn the screen off. If I destroy codeMainActivitycode and keep the screen on until the alarm goes off, all is well. If I let codeMainActivitycode  live, and keep the screen on, codeAlarmActivitycode shows up on top of codeMainActivitycode , as expected. Otherwise, if the screen is OFF... AlarmActivity is shown for a split second, then it disappears, and I see MainActivity  on screen. What givesp  pHere is where I schedule the alarm.

Also, references to nonexistent icons in the XML resulted in the icons simply not displaying, but never an error.p  pIs there anything special about custom icons which needs to be observed for them to work, for example, no transparency  Or is the addin file just so fragile and sensitive  Or should I try a later WinZip versionp  pThese icons were originally found on www.iconfinder.com then made smaller originally 32 x 32, then reduced to 16 x 16 using MS Paint.  I also tried changing them to 24 colour .BMP icons and had the same problem.p  pI had custom icons in Excel 2010 copied from the same place, but 32 x 32 which worked without any fuss.p  pAny suggestions would be most welcome.p

Negative 4963 pMy question is fairly straightforward, but I will include some background information to flesh out the problemp  pI have a server in my office which runs software to create maps.  These maps are updated with new information when people in my office enter data into an application.p  pI have a public website which shows these maps to users.  This website is hosted on a GoDaddy shared hosting plan.  In order for the website to retrieve a map from my inhouse server, I use CURL to send a request to the inhouse server.  The inhouse server checks the IP of the calling server as well as some other credentials and then issues a key.p  pThis has always worked well.  My website has always been hosted on a dedicated server, which had a static IP.  I recently moved the site to a shared plan.  I was advised that the only way to have a static IP on this plans is to purchase an SSL certificate.  Now my website is unable to authenticate at my inhouse server.  p  pI dont know much about SSL.  GoDaddy tells me my static IP is one thing, but if I run a PHP command     codeecho SERVER[SERVERADDR]code  on my hosted website I see  a very different IP.p  pThis leaves me wonderingp  pstrong1.strong When I send a CURL request form this SSL certified server, what is the originating IP Address  Is there a way to checkp  pstrong2.strong Does a CURL request which originates on an SSL site need any special parameters  I have learned that a request which emcallsem an SSL server must have special parameters.

Negative 4963 pI am working on an http endpoint that will receive a request from a client and block until it receives an ack for that request from another server or until it passes a timeout. The communication between my code and the server is not included in this sample, but you can assume that for each request, an ack may be received eventually.p  pSince many requests will pass through my module in short periods of time, I cannot assume that a given ack is related the the request I am blocking on. strongEDITstrong Clarification here since it has caused some confusion. Both requests and acks are received by the controller from external sources. This is why I am handling them asychronously. strongEDITstrong For this reason, my code places acks back on the channel if they are not relevant. It is also important to note that http.ListenAndServe calls my functions asynchronously.p  pIf the request is acked within the timeout, there are no problems. However, it the ack comes after the timeout has passed, it will be added to a channel and never removed. This will cause the channel to fill up. I am afraid to use a cancel channel because it is also possible that no ack will be received for a given request, causing the cancel channel to fill as well. p  pstrongThe Questionstrong How can I keep late acks from filling my channelHow can I identify and remove late acksp  pCode below.

Negative 4963 pI am using django to allow a user to upload images along with text to describe the image title.p  pThe user should be able to edit the image title and change the image file using the edit template. This does work  to some degree.p  pI can display the image file and the image title in the edit template for editing. The issue I have is when I do not include an image file in the file upload input the user only wants to change the image title and not the image file, the code I have does change the image title but the image file is deleted from the database the physical image file is not deleted from the file system.p  pI can successfully update the image details but the user must include a new image file or the same image file in the file upload input field for the  image title the image details to be successfully updated.p  pIt seems the user strongmuststrong include an image file in the file upload input field.

Negative 4963 pApologies if this is a silly question, but is there a way to find out what dependencies the gems I use in a Rails App havebr Basically, there was an issue where an older version of the fontawesomesass gem was being loaded despite a newer version being specified in the Gemfile. There was a suggestion that this may be because another gem being used was depending on it. Without trawling through the repos for all the gems being used, is there a way of telling which gem may be depending on itbr We resolved the issue by uninstalling the older fontawesomesass gem, but as a newbie, Im still curious to know whether there is a way to view all dependencies when I use gems.br Thanksp

But if we look into the sparse and usually misleading Apple documentation, we may find out the following important detailsp  blockquote   pstrongURLstrongbr   The location of the media object. readonlybr   This property is provided as a securityscoped URL. In order to gain access to the file that this URL refers to, the caller must call codestartAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode before and codestopAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode after using the URL to access the file.p blockquote  pSo, it is obvious that access to the resource have to be bracketed with a codestartAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecodecodestopAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode calls pair.p  pstrongThe question is where should I put these calls given the current codeQLPreviewPanelDataSourcecode protocol definitionstrong It is up to QLPreviewPanel to access the resource, not my code, but unfortunately I hardly ever will believe that Apple updated QL to operate in a sandboxingwise environment.p  pstrongHow do I handle the cases, when codestartAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode call returns codeNOcode, stating about failure to obtain an accessstrongp  pSeems like when you try to codestartAccessingSecurityScopedResourcecode on an URL that is already being accessed you get the failure flag on return. Like, everything is OK, but you get an error flag. Seems like these startstop... calls have to be paired precisely, and even a balanced nesting is forbidden. strongSo, how to differentiate between the two possibilities when you get a codeNOcode on return a securityscoped URL that is already being accessed and a securityscoped URL that failed to resolvestrongp  pIt is an experimentallyproven fact, that your application can only access a finite amount of securityscoped URLs you can take about 1500 URLs before it will silently stop working. So, how should I properly relinquish access to the securityscoped URLs after Ive passed them to the QLPreviewPanel When it it a right time to do so It seems to me like it is a private implementation detail of a QLPreviewPanel class and I can make no assumptions about its internal workings.p

Negative 4963 pstrongEditstrong The goal of asking this question is to determine if I understand memory allocation and garbage collection in Java, not whether or not there are better ways to show and rotate an image in Android.p  pI am writing an Activity that lets a user open an image file, rotate the image, crop the image, then save the resulting rotated  cropped image to disc.p  pWhile solving this problem I have been keeping a close eye on allocated memory and am wondering if the behavior I am seeing is a Expected or b Indicative of a programming error.p  pstrongThe behaviorstrongp  p1 An image is selected from a gallery. The image is decoded from a file using BitmapFactory and I create a bitmap variable which I then display in my ImageView. I notice that when I do this my allocation jumps by a certain amount. Lets say 1MB for discussion.p  p2 The user wants to rotate the image by 90 degrees. They hit a button and the following code is run to rotate the bitmap.p  precode    Matrix matrix  new Matrix     matrix.postRotate90.0     this.mBitmap  Bitmap.createBitmapthis.mBitmap, 0, 0, this.mBitmap.getWidth, this.mBitmap.getHeight, matrix, true codepre  pThis code takes the existing bitmap variable and applies a rotation to it which I then display in the ImageView again. This functions just fine, but if I watch the memory allocation I can see that it jumps by another 1 MB. This makes sense to me because I had the original bitmap in memory, then I created a copy that was rotated by 90 degrees in memory so I have 2x the original bitmap size in memory.p  pI have noticed that on some devices the garbage collector seems to be pretty aggressive and will only very briefly allow this 2x memory allocation but will almost immediately cause a GC and bring the allocated memory down to just 1MB. However, on other devices I have noticed that the 2x memory allocation wont immediately cause a GC. On those devices if I do multiple rotations I might get 3x or 4x of allocated memory before a GC occurs.p  pMy question is, is amount of allocation happening a problem if, when the GC runs, the allocation drops down to its original value In other words, am I creating some sort of memory leak here or are things behaving as they should and when the system needs memory it performs a GC and everything returns to normalp  pstrongEditstrong The app I am writing is for SDK versions 15 4.x and upp

Negative 4963 pI could probably setup a couple testbed applications and find out, but Im hoping someone has already experienced this or just simply has a more intuitive understanding.  I have three executables.  Two different clients call them Client1.exe and Client2.exe and a WCF service host call it Host.exe that hosts whats more or less a message bus type service for the two clients.  I wont get into the whys as thats a long story and not productive to this question.  p  pThe point is this, Client1 sends a request through this service to Client2. Client2 performs operations, then responds with results to Client1.  Client1 will always be initiator of requests, so this order of operations will always be consistent this way.  This also means that Client1 can open its channels to communicate to this service asneeded, whereas due to the need of callback services, Client2 has to keep its channels open.  Ive began by attempting to keepalive.  However, these are all three on the desktop and PC sleep events, or other issues not sure seem to interfere with it.  And once it times out, everything has to be restarted which makes it a real pain.  I have some ideas I may try to help the keepalive approach, but this brought up a question that I dont have an answer to... is this the best use of my resources.  p  pThe way I figure it, there are two main approaches for Client2, p  ol liKeepAlive with a lot of monitoring timers and checking of connection states and connection resetting code which would be faster since it could respond to requests immediately.  The downside is this has to be kept alive throughout the time that the user keeps Client2 open on their desktop which could be short and sweet to crazylong.li liPoll periodically for a request which would allow the resources to only be used when checking or processing a request from Client1.  This would be slower since poll requests would not be realtime, but would eliminate any external issue concerns disconnecting the service.  This would also cause me to have to add more state to the service.  Its already a PerSession service with a list of available instances of Client2 IDs so that Client1 knows which instance its talking to, but it would add more.  li ol  pClient2 performs many other functions and so still has to be very performant with this process, which makes me wonder which is most likely to cost in resources  Is the polling approach more costly in resources  Or attempting to keepalivep

Negative 4963 pOur web app has two different namespaces.

In addition, other properties within the cookie disappear along with the change, so it seems that a new cookie has been created in place. Going back to a Struts action within codepackageOnecode reverses this change, reinstating the previous codeJSESSIONIDcode cookie.p  pFrom our understanding, a new codeJSESSIONIDcode is created whenever a particular user session does not already exist.

Negative 4963 pI have a program that runs multiple tasklets using stackless python, and my problem is that though it is fast, I do notice a slowdown if I start one or more processes that run the same code. p  pFor example, using threads inside the processes it takes my program 6 seconds to complete, and if I start 2 processes it still only takes 6 seconds to complete. But if I use tasklets the program only takes 2 seconds to complete, but then it takes 4 seconds if I run 2 processes simultaneously and 6 seconds if I run 3 processes and etc.p  pMy question is, is this the normal behavior of stackless python I checked to make sure the tasklets in the separate processes are using separate schedulers and each process can only see their tasklets, but maybe all the tasklets in all the processes are still fighting over system resources Its the only explanation I can think of for why each additional process would cause a slowdown when using tasklets but not threads. I need someone to explain this to me so I can figure out if theres something wrong with my code or if this is an unavoidable issue.   p

The argument to the function is a filename constructed using usersupplied input. If an attacker is allowed to specify all or part of the filename, it may be possible to gain unauthorized access to files on the server, including those outside the webroot, that would be normally be inaccessible to end users. The level of exposure depends on the effectiveness of input validation routines, if any. The first argument to Delete contains tainted data from the variable path. The tainted data originated from an earlier call to systemwebdll.system.web.httprequest.getparamsp  p2Validate all usersupplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

Negative 4963 pI want to have a scrollable text box and I know there are Two ways,  The first one is to apply scrolling setting to text box and The second is to put the text box in a scroll viewer . The first ones performance for long text is awful and full of lags while the second is so smooth but unfortunately limited to 2048 px height size. And can contain at most 95 lines and the rest is clipped by the platform. I was looking for a way till I found the rate and review page of apps text box in WP which is not limited to any height size   So how can I have such a text box like it I know also I can use a web view and text area element but using html and Js can not do what a text box in c canp  pThnx.p

Negative 4963 pI am trying to simplify a series of tests where I copy a long string of JSON thats sent to a server for execution which has several UUIDs embedded in them that I need to know.  Im trying to run assertions on the response, but need some of the UUIDs in order to read the correct return value.p  pThe JSON strings are very long, and it would be very tedious to go into every single one that I want to run an assertion for and identify the correct UUID, so Im wanting to use RegEx to basically parse out the request data and pull the correct UUID i need to look for into a JMeter variable, which I can then use for future testing.p  pI cant find a way to use RegEx on request data, which makes sense because NORMALLY you know exactly what you are requesting.  In my case, I dont or rather from the programs view I do, but I, as a person, dont .p  pMy work around is to build a beanshell echo script which would allow me to put the long JSON string into a variable, which I would then send directly to the Response Data, which I could then use RegEx on.p  pExamplep  precodeSampleResult.setResponseDatajsonData SampleResult.setDataTypeorg.apache.jmeter.samplers.SampleResult.TEXT codepre  pThe main problem I am having is that the JSON is interlaced with a TON of characters which would need to be escaped tons of double quotes, for instance.p  pIs there a way to get around this by perhaps treating all of the JSON as a string literalp

Negative 4963 pIve recently done some testing with Amazon AWS security groups in our VPC. p  pI have a LAMP stack server inside of sgoffice and have ports 22, 80 and 3306 open to our office IP32. Everything works great.p  pI thought that you could add SG B to SG A to organize IPs a bit. For example, I wanted to create a sgcontractors and an sgoffice to organize the remote IPs that would have access into a separate security group, since the remote contractors IPs are prone to change, while our office IP is static.p  pHere are the steps I followed.p  ol liI added a new sgcontractors security group and added their IP32 and ingress on 22, 80, and 3306,li liwent back to sgoffice and added ingress ALL TCP to custom IP sgcontractors. It popped up in the list of other security groups as I typed sg..., so I figured this had to be the way to do it.li ol  pThe remote users could not connect.p  pI tried again, p  ol start3 liediting sgcontractors to have ingress ALL TCP set to 0.0.0.00 li ol  pStill the remote users cannot connect. I even p  ol start4 liadded ingress ALL TCP contractorssg to contractorssg, as a test. li ol  pStill the remote users cannot connect to the server.p  pNaturally, if I put the remote contractors IP32 directly into sgoffice and readd ports 22, 80 and 3306 for their IP32, it works fine, it just makes the sgoffice rules much more disorganized and confusing, since theres no way to label any IPs and there has to be multiple rules per contractor.  p  pSo what am I missing and how do you make this workp

Negative 4963 pIve got a working method for combining two sheets of data however, it is a bit slower than I had hoped.  I am wondering if anyone knows of a faster way to combine the data.  p  pI compare two sheets with roughly 700 and 400 rows, respectively. Data in sheet 1 contains unique aircraft flight numbers along with a separate row for each leg of that flight one mission number may have 5 or 6 legs of a flight, each on its own row.  Sheet 2 contains that same mission number, but tells me how many passengers and how much cargo called lifts, if any, are on certain legs.  Only those legs with lifts are listed in this sheet.  Some lifts stay onboard for multiple legs.  The empty legs are not shown.p  pI need to combine the two so that the passenger and cargo information from Sheet 2 is added to the correct leg of the mission on Sheet 1.  This gives me a complete, detailed view of that mission.  I take this data and show it on a graphical map I created in Excel.p  pHere is the code I use, currentlyp  precodeSub combineDataTest  Application.ScreenUpdating  False  Dim i As Long, j As Long Dim lastRow As Long, lastRow2 As Long  Dim ws2 As Worksheet, ws3 As Worksheet Set ws2  ThisWorkbook.SheetsFull Missions Set ws3  ThisWorkbook.SheetsPassengers and Cargo  ws2.ColumnsHJ.Cells.Clear  lastRow  findLastRowPassengers and Cargo calls a function that returns the last row lastRow2  findLastRowFull Missions calls a function that returns the last row   Add column names on mission sheet ws2.RangeH1.Value  LIFT CODE ws2.RangeI1.Value  LIFT PASSENGERS ws2.RangeJ1.Value  LIFT CARGO  For i  2 To lastRow     For j  2 To lastRow2           If the mission numbers match         If ws3.RangeA amp i.Value  Leftws2.RangeD amp j.Value, 9 And          ws2.RangeE amp j.Value gt ws3.RangeC amp i.Value And          ws2.RangeE amp j.Value lt ws3.RangeD amp i.Value  1 Then              If ws2.RangeH amp j.Value   Then                 ws2.RangeH amp j.Value  ws3.RangeQ amp i.Value                 ws2.RangeI amp j.Value  ws3.RangeO amp i.Value                 ws2.RangeJ amp j.Value  ws3.RangeP amp i.Value             Else                 ws2.RangeH amp j.Value  ws2.RangeH amp j.Value amp ,  amp ws3.RangeQ amp i.Value                 ws2.RangeI amp j.Value  ws2.RangeI amp j.Value  ws3.RangeO amp i.Value                 ws2.RangeJ amp j.Value  ws2.RangeJ amp j.Value  ws3.RangeP amp i.Value             End If          End If      Next j Next i codepre  pIf you have a better idea of how to run through the code, I would greatly appreciate it.

If a different a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.http.httpmessagehandler.aspx relnofollowHttpMessageHandlera is used e.g. the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.http.webrequesthandler.aspx relnofollowWebRequestHandlera then different headers may be added for example codeContentEncodingcode and codeCacheControlcode. If I dont know about all the headers in the message I will not be able to compute the correct signature.p

Negative 4963 pLong story medium Im dabbling in some HTMLPHPJS and things are generally going well. Im making a mock game, and Im messing around with making a game map. Take 1 was drawing the map server side and passing it to the client each page load, and now Im trying my hand at using an HTML5 canvas and clientside javascript to handle drawing.p  pI want to be able to have the user able to click on the map, and have a new page load with information retrieved from a database about the contents of the grid they click on. Using the server side method, I used a server side map to pass click coordinates and work out which grid they clicked on using some simple math.p  pIve more or less worked out getting the click coordinate from a mousedown listener on the canvas, but now Im trying to make the same function update a form for navigation and then load the page using javascript. The form works If I type 1,1 into the xy coordinate fields and click go, I get information about grid 1,1, but clicking on grid 1,1 does not pass the POST variables properly the page does refresh, but the portion of the script php that checks for POST variables fails to find any, but does find them if you clicked the go button.p  pThe canvas and form are as followsp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv idscrollablegt ltcanvas idgameCanvas widthltphp echo max gt heightltphp echo max gtgtltcanvasgtltbrgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltform idgamenavform actiongame2.php methodpostgt X Coord ltinput idgamenavx typetext namexcoord size2 gtltbrgt Y Coord ltinput idgamenavy typetext nameycoord size2 gtltbrgt ltinput typesubmit namemapnav valueGo gt ltformgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p  pThe relevant portion of javascript is as followsp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscriptgt document.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, init, false  function init  var canvas  document.getElementByIdgameCanvas var ctx  canvas.getContext2d ctx.fillStyle  FF0000 ctx.fillRect0,0,99999,99999 canvas.addEventListenermousedown, getPosition, false   function getPositionevent   long function snipped var navx  document.getElementByIdgamenavx var navy  document.getElementByIdgamenavy navx.value  Math.floorx64  ltphp echo gameInfo[1] gt navy.value  Math.floory64  ltphp echo gameInfo[1] gt document.getElementByIdgamenavform.submit  ltscriptgtcodepre div div p  pAnd just for completeness, the portion of PHP that checks the POST variables looks like thisp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeifissetPOST[mapnav]  coords[0]  POST[xcoord] coords[1]  POST[ycoord]  else  coords[0]  0 coords[1]  0 codepre div div p  pWhen clicking on the canvas, the navigation fields change to the appropriate coordinate, but when the page loads, they come up as the default 0,0 as though it was a fresh page load with no POST values. When I insert debug code after ifissetPOST[mapnav] I only ever evaluates to true if I reached the page by actually clicking go on the navigation form, rather than clicking on the canvas, which DOES load a new page which can only be because of the submit function being called, its not in an anchor or anything but fails the above test and executes the else clause.p  pIs there something Im doing wrong or missingp  pEDIT I see that what Im missing is that clicking the submit button sets the variable Im checking, but JS submit does not do so. Im sure theres a JS click way I could make it happen. I could also check for the actual values being set as well. Is there any practical reason to go one way over the other Or perhaps another option thats just betterp
