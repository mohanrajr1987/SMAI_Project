Positive 6268 pI have an EXE built from Visual Studio and Id like to clear or just remove the path portion of the PDB filename.  Im looking for a tool to make this adjustment in the PEs debug directory, without using a hex editor.  Many have suggested BinPlace, but I cant get this to work.  I have yet to see a command line for binplace that actually works for this purpose. Other Microsoft tools have been suggested and these tools have literally no documentation besides the command line help.  The command line help also indicates thats not what these tools are for e.g. pdbstr.  Again, people making these suggestions post no command line usage information and since these tools arent documented, Im back at square one.  Relinking is not an option for me in this case but I am aware of the linker switches that alter this information.  Are there any tools that will work with clearing PDB path information from an EXE or do you have a binplace command line that worksp

Positive 6268 pI have a program that displays a thumbnail of an image. There is a button that offers the user the option to open the image fullscreen using the machines default image viewer. However, every time I have tried this, it has crashed. Ive toyed around with it and here is what Ive found so farp  pThe image on the thumbnail is part of a codeListltBitmapgtcode called codeimagescode. When the button is clicked to open the image fullscreen, the code runs a function to find the index of the image currently being displayed, and then use codeProcess.Startimages[current]code to open the image in the viewer.p  pHere is the code that runs this so farp  precode    private void btnViewImageClickobject sender, EventArgs e              identify image displayed on screen         Bitmap displayImage  images[displayImageIndex]         get full file path of the image         string displayImagePath  Path.GetFullPathdisplayImage          instance of class to open specified image in image viewer         ProcessStartInfo imageStartInfo  new ProcessStartInfodisplayImagePath         assign maxwindow attribute to instance of class         imageStartInfo.WindowStyle  ProcessWindowStyle.Maximized         open path using assigned instance of class         Process.StartdisplayImagePath      codepre  pThe path method of Path.GetFileNamedisplayImage gives an error message because it requires a string to be passed as the parameter rather than the Bitmap. However, when I attempted to change it to codestring displayImagePath  Path.GetFullPathdisplayImage.ToStringcode, this caused the application to crash. When I stepped through the code I found that my use of the codedisplayImage.ToStringcode actually initialised codedisplayImagePathcode to codeSystem.Drawing.Bitmapcode simply giving the variable type in a string rather than anything to do with its location.p  pFollowing this experimentation, Im not really sure where to go next. I cant think of another method or route to doing this or any way to get the file path.p

Negative 6268 pI am doing conversion to image and PDF output.  I need an input HTML document that is generated by our application JSPs.  Essentially, I need to render the final output product of a JSP based application to a String or memory and then use that string for other processing.p  pWhat are some ways that I can just invoke the JSP renderer to get the final HTML content that is normally output to the user Ideally, I am looking for something that will work for multiple application servers like websphere.  But something that is Tomcat specific will also work.p  pThere are a couple of other different approaches, but I think rendering the JSP which may include sub JSPs is the best approach.p  pOptional Paths that I would rather stay away from.p  ol lipI could perform a network request to the page using the Socket APIs and then read the final output that is rendered from that particular page.  This is probably the next best option, but we work on multiple servers and JVMs, targeting the page I need would be complicated.pli lipUse a filter to get that final page output.  This Ok but I have always had problems with filters and illegalstateexceptions.  It never seems to work 100 the way I need to.pli ol  pIt seems like this should be simple.  The JSP compiler is essentially just a library for parsing an input JSP document and subdocuments and then output some HTML content. I would like to invoke that process through Java code. On the server and possibly as a standalone console application.p

Negative 6268 pI see that I would benefit from using the class view in visual studio.

Negative 6268 pI just submitted this to Apple Support, but Im wondering if anyone here has encountered something similar.p  pstrongSUMMARY my iphone app crashes when downloaded from the iTunes app store or from an adhoc distribution, but emdoesntem crash when run in debug mode on the simulator or on my iPodstrongp  pstrongDETAILSstrong The app contains a rather large sqlite database file 180 meg uncompressed, 56 meg compressed.  This may be relevant.p  pWhen launched, the application emshouldem copy the database if necessary.  After this, the user should be presented with a tableview containing approximately 6,000 rows.  The information presented within these rows is derived from reading a table within the aforementioned database.p  pThis all works properly when I run the application in the iPhone strongsimulator and alsostrong when I run the application in debug mode on my strongiPodstrong.p  pThe app was approved by Apple.  However, when users began to download the app through iTunes, I began receiving emails saying that the UITableView was not populated with any information.  To investigate, I downloaded a copy of the app from the app store and I saw a similar result i.e., UITableView is displayed, but the rows are empty. p  pstrongI believe I am able to reproduce the problem using an adhoc distribution of my app.strongp  pThe adhoc distribution behaves similarly i.e. shows no rows in the UITableView to the appstore download.  Specifically, I have done the following multiple times I delete and reinstall the application each time.p  ol liadd my adhoc provisioning certificate to iTunes li liadd my adhoc app build to iTunesli lisync my iPod Touch with iTunes li listart my adhoc appli liapp seems to always crash upon the emfirstem startup i.e., the splash screen shows for a second and then I see the home screen of my iPod Touch li liemsecondem and subsequent startups of the adhoc app do not crash, but the UITableView is empty. li listrongNone of this happens when I run the app on the simulator or when I deploy in developmentdebug mode on the same iPod.strongli ol  pI have tried to examine crash logs associated with the initial crashing of the app see step 5 above, but no crash log is created at that point in time.  HOWEVER, a crash log emisem created when I sync iTunes with my iPod Touch, but it might as well be written in Polish.p  pSo, it appears as though the appstore reviewers who approved my app only examined the behavior of the application using the simulator andor in developmentdebug mode.  Its possible that the issue is related to the large size of the database file, but this is complete speculation on my part.  To the best of my understanding there should not be a limit on appsize or database size near 180 meg. This also wouldnt necessarily explain why the app works in debugdevelopment mode.p  h1Has anyone seen anything similarh1

Negative 6268 pThe idea is somewhat similar to what a hrefhttplists.cs.uiuc.edupipermailllvmdev2006August006492.html relnofollowApple has done in the OpenGL stacka. I want to have that a bit more general.p  pBasically, I want to have specialised and optimised variants of some code for some specific cases.p  pIn other words I have given an algorithmcode for a function let B  0,1p  precodef  Bn gt Bm codepre  pNow, I special a specific case by a function which predefines part of the input of emfemp  precodepreset  1..n gt 0,1,unset codepre  pThe amount of predefinitions  0..n is then given byp  precodepn  preset0,1 codepre  pCanonically, we now get a specialised functionp  precodefpreset  Bnpn gt Bm codepre  pAlso canonically, we get the codealgorithm for this specialised function. Naturally, the code for emfpresetem will be somewhat more fast than emfem with pn  0. Then, you also can optimise this code further there might be some dead code now, some loops can be unpacked now, some calculations can be precalculated, etc. In some cases, it can have noteable improvements.p  pApple does roughly this for their OpenGL stack from what I have read  know They try to find a good preset at runtime after everything is setup for variables which will not change anymore, then make an optimised version of the specialised function and only use that one instead of the original function.p  pInitially, I thought about a way to optimise the physics simulation of some own game. There I have a lot of particle objects and a set of particle types which is unknown at compile time. A particle type is a set of attributes. The particle types are fixed and constant once they are loaded. Each particle object is of one of theye particle types. The physic simulation for a particle object is some very heavy peace of code with many many branches and very heavily depends on the particle type. My idea was now to have an optimised physics simulation function for each particle type.p  pAfter thinking a bit about this, I wanted to go a bit furtherp  pI want to automatically calculate a set of such presets at runtime and maintain the optimised code for each. And I want to automatically add or remove presets when the circumstances change.p  pThere are several questions nowp  ul liIs there an easy way to calculate a good preset How do I know what variables are constant for a given situationli liIs there an easy way to check how good a preset is Good refers to the performance of the resulting optimised code.li liHow to compare two algorithmscodes for performance Via some heuristic Or by testing with random inputli liHow many presets and optimised code variants should there be for a function A fixed limit for all functions Or is this different for every function Is it maybe even depending on the current computer stateli liHow to maintain the different optimised code variants A wrapper function around emfem which chooses automatically the best optimised variant doesnt seem to be very nice as this maybe not so easy check would be needed for every single call. A solution to this problem might also be deeply related to the question about how to find the setamount of good presets. In the particle type case, the optimised code would be attached to  saved together with the particle type. The amount of particle types also define the amount of presets.li ul  pFor my initial case, most of these questions are kind of obsolete but am really interested now in how to do this in a more general way. Of course, mostall of these questions are also uncalculateable but I wonder to what degree you may still get good results.p  pThis whole topic is also very important for optimisations in JIT compilers. Are they doing these kind of optimisations already To what degreep  pAre there good recent research works which answers some of my questions Or maybe also some results which say that it is just too hard to do this in such a general wayp

The server uses hibernate for persistence and querying so it has a set of annotated hibernate objects for persistence.p  pThe client sends HQL queries to the server and gets responses back.  The client has an autogenerated set of objects that match the server hibernate objects for query results and basic persistence.p  pI would like to support using Linq to query as well as Hql as it makes the queries typesafe and quicker to build no more typos in HQL string queries.  Ive looked around at the following but I cant see how to get them to fit with what I have.p  ul liNHibernates Linq provider  requires using NHibernate ISession and ISessionFactory, which I dont haveli liLinqExtender  requires a lot of annotations on the objects and extending a base type, too invasiveli ul  pWhat I really want is something that will generate give me a nice easy to process structure to build the HQL queries from.  Ive read most of a 15 page article written by one of the C developers on how to create custom providers and its pretty fraught, mainly because of the complexity of the expression tree.p  pCan anyone suggest an approach for implementing Linq  HQL translation  Perhaps a library that will the cleanup of the expression tree into something more SQLHQLish.p  pI would like to support selectfromwheregroup byorder byjoins.  Not too worried about subqueries.p

Negative 6268 pSo redhat uses python 2.4 and I need to upgrade to python 2.6 so I did an altinstall does anybody know how to install modpython I am installing from source.

Im still a newbie to this... any pointer in the right direction would be greatly appreciatedp  pN.B. I cant use wsgi because my server hosts some other websites that relies on modpyhton and if I install both I heard bad things happen segfaults, deadlocks etc...

Negative 6268 pIm having crashing issues using the Quartz PDF API for iOS. At the moment I am compiling with the SDK 4.0 GM Seed and running on my 3.2 iPad I have tried using the 3.2 SDK with identical results.p  pAll the code I am using is based on the standard Apple Quartz documentation and from various sources around the internets. So I cant image Im doing something drastically different or wrong.p  pThe code runs perfectly in the Simulator all versions, its a Universal app and even while using the Simulate Memory Warning function. Ive used the Leaks tool and there are no leaks that it finds. Build and Analyze also finds nothing. No crash or low memory log is left in my Library.p  pAll this leads me to believe the device is running out of memory. This happens after running through say 50 pdf pages, with about 35 having an image of some sort some full page some icon. It does not crash on any particular page. The pdf I am loading is about 75 pages and 3.5MB.p  pIve perused similar issues on this site and around the internets, and have applied some of the advice in the code below. I now release the pdf document reference on every page turn and I no longer retainrelease a page reference. Ive also simplified the image swapping from using CGImages to just using the UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext function. Ive tried various implementations for switching the images, including replacing the pdfImgView completely with a newly allocated temp instance using code[[UIImageView alloc] iniWithImageUIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext]code, using the setter for pdfImgView and releasing the temp. All of the variations pass the Leaks and Analyzer tests, but still exhibit the same crashing behavior.p  pSo, before I move away from PDFs altogether, is there something I should try or something I am missingp  pView controller code that is called in interface handlers to swap pages and on first loadp  precode[self drawPage]   ...animation code...simple CATransition animation...crashes with or without   scrollView is a UIScrollView that is a subview of self.view [scrollView.layer addAnimationtransition forKeynil]  pdfImgView is a UIImageView that is a subview of scrollView pdfImgView.image  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext codepre  pdrawPage method used to configure and draw PDF page to the contextp  precode[CFURLRef pdfURL  CFBundleCopyResourceURLCFBundleGetMainBundle, CFSTRBMEinterior.pdf, NULL, NULL pdfRef  CGPDFDocumentCreateWithURLCFURLRefpdfURL  instance variable, not a property CFReleasepdfURL CGPDFPageRef page  CGPDFDocumentGetPagepdfRef, currentPage  CGRect box  CGPDFPageGetBoxRectpage, kCGPDFMediaBox  ...setting scale and imageHeight, both floats...  if UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions  NULL      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptionsCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, imageHeight, NO, 0.0  else      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, imageHeight  CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext NSLogpage is d, context is d, pdf doc is d, pdf page is d, currentPage, context, pdfRef, page  all prints properly   ...setting up scrollView for new page, using same instance...

Negative 6268 pIm really just looking for some guidance. Here is the scenariop  pA user can add an FTP account via a password protected control panel. I need to save these credentials so that the FTP account can be connected to automatically. This is easy but I want to take the most secure approach possible. I was thinking of possibly encrypting the password clientside and then sending the encrypted password to the server for storage. Then the encrypted value would be pulled out and decrypted client side before the FTP connection was made.p  pI know that isnt too secure but its all I can think of. Do you guys have any other bright ideas to make this more secure Thanksp

Negative 6268 pI was just wondering where I could find more information on these optimizations Google searches tend to emphasize prepared queries and such, and not really at the angle of the abstraction the SQL provides.p  pSource a hrefhttpwww.joelonsoftware.comarticlesLeakyAbstractions.html relnofollowhttpwww.joelonsoftware.comarticlesLeakyAbstractions.htmlap  blockquote   pThe SQL language is meant to abstract   away the procedural steps that are   needed to query a database, instead   allowing you to define merely what you   want and let the database figure out   the procedural steps to query it. But   in some cases, certain SQL queries are   thousands of times slower than other   logically equivalent queries. A famous   example of this is that some SQL   servers are dramatically faster if you   specify where ab and bc and ac   than if you only specify where ab   and bc even though the result set is   the same. Youre not supposed to have   to care about the procedure, only the   specification. But sometimes the   abstraction leaks and causes horrible   performance and you have to break out   the query plan analyzer and study what   it did wrong, and figure out how to   make your query run faster.p blockquote  pLooking at MySql in particular.p

hrefhttpwww.axiis.orgexamplesLineAreaSeriesExample.html relnofollowAxiis Line Charta into my project, which I think is pretty cool. But I am having some trouble with implementing it, as the LineChart was originally written in FLEX 3 and my project being FLEX 4. It finally displays correctly with all data supplied but I cannot click on anything on the LineChart without receiving an error.p  pI would like to point out that this is not a duplicate question, as a similar question has been answered on stackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2879474adobeflashbuiderflex4error2025orerroraddchildisnotavailableinherea. My question is eerily similar, except my project already uses the  namespace from what I can tell, which is mentioned as the fix in the previous stackoverflow answer. Maybe I am not using the namespace correctly, in the correct places I am unsure and can post more of my components and their code if necessary. I might be speaking greek here, or might be confusing some of you, but I am only 6 days into my FLEX development lifespan, so please excuse my ignorance as this is a completely new field for me.p  pI was able to get my hands on the .SWC files needed for the FLEX 4 upgrade for Axiis and Degrafa4, thanks to some really nice guys working on the open source projects for these tools. You can find those files a hrefhttpwww.dedoose.comFileStorageDevUploadsJTAxiisAndDegrafa4Swcs.zip relnofollowherea.p  pI currently receive the errorp  blockquote   pArgumentError Error 2025 The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller.       at flash.displayDisplayObjectContainergetChildIndex       at mx.managersSystemManagergetChildIndex[Edev4.xframeworksprojectsframeworksrcmxmanagersSystemManager.as1665]       at mx.managers.systemClassesActiveWindowManagermouseDownHandler[Edev4.0.0frameworksprojectsframeworksrcmxmanagerssystemClassesActiveWindowManager.as471]   Blockquotep blockquote  pThis error only occurs on my 4th tabVBOX, which contains the Axiis LineChart. Once a user has clicked on the chart the errors appear on all UI components, wherever I click.p  pIf you google the error message, most people resolve it by changing explicit code that adds or removes UI objects. This is not my case at all, there is no explicit adding or removing in my code that I could change. This leads me to believe this is a namespaceframeworklibrary problem, or that my project is not designed correctly from a UICanvasNamespace standpoint. I am not familiar enough with FLEX 4 to know where to use the Spark, MXML, MX namespaces s,fx, mx, etc. p  pAny help or ideas are appreciated, as this bug is a current show stopper.

Negative 6268 pIm currently scoping out a project for the iPad which is rather text and font heavy. There are many pages of styled text, which also need custom fonts. I have toyed with the idea of simply rendering PDF or PNG files onscreen, but I think we need to be able to dynamically repaginate the text.p  pWeve used UIWebView in a previous project quite successfully, however there are a few things I dont like about it... Firstly, you have to hide all the silly drop shadow elements to stop them showing when the user scrolls beyond the bounds, and we had to add some JavaScript to find out actually when a page had fully loaded. Overall, the experience seemed a bit clunky, as well as worrying if the project could potentially break if Apple decided to update the subviews...p  pThe other thing weve been looking at is Core Text, which looks very powerful. The only worry with this is that it appears to be a rather steep learning curve for us since weve mainly been working in UIKit with a bit of Core Graphics. I couldnt even work out how to change the size of the font after a mornings work.p  pAre there any other alternatives Should I stick with Core Text Is there any way of using UITextView with multiple fonts and stylesp  pThanksp  pJoep  pEDIT by alternatives, I am really looking for builtin iPhone SDK alternatives only please... I would rather not mess with third party frameworks because I dont have the time... Thanks p

Negative 6268 pI have a table that contains partial data that is of no use to the user viewing my application. The viewer wants to see a similar table that has all the values calculated out, and wants to be able to quickly query THAT data. Normally, this would be the perfect place to use a View. Unfortunately the complex nature of the calculations limit my use of Views, so I need an alternate solution. I was thinking of doing something like the following...p  pTable A contains backend data. Any time this table is updated, a trigger fired that updates Table B, which shows the result of these calculations. Table B can be queried quickly at this point.p  pMy only concern is that the calculation procedure is somewhat lengthy, and Table A has the potential to be updated many times in bursts. Are there any solutions that are almost like a Before Select trigger So basically Table A could be updated many times in a row, but the calculation would only occur when Table B was queriedp  pHeres an example timelinep  ol liTable A is Updatedli liTable A is Updated Again [Dont run SP since nobody needs Table B data yet]li liData is requested from Table B [Run SP to update Table B before getting data]li liTable A is Updatedli liData is requested from Table B [Run SP to update Table B before getting data]li liData is requested from Table B [Dont run stored procedure because Table A wasnt updated between requests for Table B data]li ol  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs there anything existing like what I described aboveli liIf not, is there a way to make triggers hold off until the completion of a batch of updatesinserts Table A wont be modified very often, so I can live with a slow trigger when it is updated. The only problem is that when Table A emdoesem get updated, it is normally hundreds of rows at a time and I dont want a slow trigger to run every time.li ol  pThanks for any solutionsinsightp  pEdit  A little more detail on why I think at least the trigger implementation would be slowp  ol liThe application that will be sending the UpdateInsertDelete statements is using LINQtoSQL, which isnt particularly good with batch operations. So if I wanted to delete a bunch of records, it would send a bunch of delete statements instead of a batch delete statement. Is there any way to group delete statements and have the trigger run after that Maybe Im getting too far off topic here.li liThe calculations Im speaking of involve some recursive functions and some decisionmaking processes. The data Im actually dealing with is scheduling data. So Table A contains tasks which may or may not have a scheduled start. If there is no scheduled start defined, it has to derive it from its predecessors scheduled start  its predecessors duration. In some cases the predecessor might not have that information either, hence the recursive query that keeps digging until it finds the result. Its not painfully slow, but if it had to run on every insertupdatedelete, it would get there. The Table B I refer to above is basically the same table, but it already has the calculated scheduled start data within which needs to change on update of Table A.li ol

Negative 6268 pI have an Asp.Net MVC webapplication sitting inside a website still largely managed by delphi. Security is currently managed by delphi which creates cookies.p  pIt has been decided to authenticate users within the ASP.Net application by extracting the cookie details and passing them to an imported Delphi DLL which returns true or false depending on whether the user is valid.p  pMy plan was to use Forms authentication, but instead of redirecting the user to a form instead call the delphi wrapper and if successful, redirect the user to the original url. This gives the benefit that when security is migrated to .Net, the authentication framework will already exist, just the implementation will need to change.p  precodepublic ActionResult LogOnSecurityCookies model, string returnUrl              try                      if model  null                              Log.DebugFormatUser login Id0, Key1, model.UserId, model.Key                 if authenticator.UserValidmodel.UserId, model.Key, 0                                      FormsService.SignInmodel.UserId, false                     return RedirectreturnUrl                               ... codepre  pNote that the SecurityCookies are generated by a custom binding class from the delphi generated cookie  this works well.p  pThe call to the delphi dll also works ok.p  pThe issue I have to overcome is that nearly all of the calls to the .Net application are ajax requests. However when the user is not logged in, the browser makes 3 calls due to the redirects 1 Original ajax request 2 Redirect to AccountLogon code above 3 Redirect back to original ajax requestp  pAlthough tracking the responses posted back to the client, show that Step 3 returns the correct data, overall the process fails for an as yet undetermined reason. Simply clicking refresh on the client works because now the user is authenticated and the redirect to accountLogon doesnt occur.p  pNote my client jQuery code is as follows       .getJSONrequestString, function data                  do something with the data       p  pIs there a way of changing the Forms Authentication process so that instead of redirecting to a Url when the User is not authenticated, I can run some other code instead Id like the fact that authentication has taken place to be completely invisible to the Users browser.p

Negative 6268 pUsing a hrefhttpsgithub.comfabpotPimplepimplea as my DI container, I have been bravely refactoring small classes to rely on DI injection, eliminating  the hardcoded dependecies I could see would be easily removed. p  pMy methodology for this task is emveryem simple, but I have no clue if it is proper as I have very little experience with DI and Unittesting aside from what I learned here in past month.  p  pI created a class, ContainerFactory that subclasses pimple, and in that subclass have created methods that simply returns container for specific object. p  pThe constructor calls the proper creator method depending on typep  precodefunction constructtypenull, mode  null   ifissettype       switch type        case DataFactory          thisgtbuildDataFactoryContainermode              break       case DbConnect          thisgtbuildDbConnectContainermode           break      default         return false          codepre  pThe method signature for conainer object creation is as followsp  precodepublic function buildDataFactoryContainermodenull codepre  pThe idea being that I can set mode to test when calling this container, and have it load test values instead of actual runtime settings. I wanted to avoid writing seperate container classes for testing, and this is the an easy way I thought to not have test related code all over. p  pI could instead have subclassed ContainerFactory ie ContainerFactoryTesting extends ContainerFactory  and override in that instead of mixing test code with app code and cluttering method signatures with modenull, but that is not the point of this post. Moving on,  to create a container for a particular object, I simply do thisp  precode  returns container with DataFactory dependencies, holds db and logger objects.  dataFactoryContainer  new ContainerFactoryDataFactory   returns container with test settings. dataFactoryTestContainer  new ContainerFactoryDataFactory,test   returns container with DbConnect dependencies, holds dbconfig and logger objects. dbConnectContainer  new ContainerFactoryDbConnect codepre  pI just ran into an issue that makes suspect the strategy I am building upon is flawed.p  pLooking at the above, DataFactory contains db object that holds database connections. I am now refactoring out this dbclass to remove its dependencies on a registry object,  but how will I create dataFactoryContainer, when I add db object that needs dbConnectContainerp  pFor example, in datafactory container I add a dbconnect instance, but IT will now need a container passed to it ...p  pI realise my english is not that great and hope I have explained well enough for a fellow SOer to understand.p  pMy question is twofold, how do you guys handle creating objects for dependencies that themselves contain dependencies, in a simple mannerp  pAnd .. how do you seperate container configuration for creation of objects for testing purposesp  pAs always, any comment or link to relevant post appreciated.p

Negative 6268 pI have a typical producerconsumer problemp  pMultiple producer applications write job requests to a jobtable on a PostgreSQL database.p  pThe job requests have a state field that starts contains QUEUED on creation.p  pThere are strongmultiplestrong consumer applications that are notified by a rule when a producer inserts a new recordp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE RULE jobrecord.added AS   ON INSERT TO jobrecord DO    NOTIFY jobrecordAdded codepre  pThey will try to reserve a new record by setting its state to RESERVED. Of course, only on consumer should succeed. All other consumers should not be able to reserve the same record. They should instead reserve other records with stateQUEUED.p  pExample  some producer added the following records to table emjobrecordemp  precodeid state  owner  payload  1 QUEUED null   ltdatagt 2 QUEUED null   ltdatagt 3 QUEUED null   ltdatagt 4 QUEUED null   ltdatagt codepre  pnow, two consumers emAem, emBem want to process them. They start running at the same time.  One should reserve id 1, the other one should reserve id 2, then the first one who finishes should reserve id 3 and so on..p  pIn a pure multithreaded world, I would use a mutex to control access to the job queue, but the consumers are different processes that may run on different machines. They only access the same database, so all synchronization must happen through the database.p  pI read a lot of documentation about concurrent access and locking in PostgreSQL, e.g. a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.0interactiveexplicitlocking.htmlhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.0interactiveexplicitlocking.htmla  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions389541selectunlockedrowinpostgresql56167145616714Select unlocked row in Postgresqla httpstackoverflow.comquestions5636006postgresqlandlocking56387535638753p  pFrom these topics, I learned, that the following SQL statement should do what I needp  precodeUPDATE jobrecord   SET owner owner, state  reserved    WHERE id         SELECT id from jobrecord WHERE state  queued          ORDER BY id  LIMIT 1           RETURNING id   will only return an id when they reserved it successfully codepre  pUnfortunately, when I run this in multiple consumer processes, in about 50 of the time, they still reserve the same record, both processing it and one overwriting the changes of the other.p  pWhat am I missing How do I have to write the SQL statement so that multiple consumers will not reserve the same record p

Negative 6268 pIve been writing a c program for the last couple weeks and the text build just got its final signoff.  I published it via visual studio, sent the installer package to my client, and it simply does not work on their computers. Ive installed the exact same binary on theirs that I have on my own for the sake of testing.  It is a program that starts with a series of popup windows, and after the final popup, the program simply closes rather than bringing up mainwindow.  I understand that without access to my source and my clients computer troubleshooting is impossible, but frankly I dont even know where to begin with this one.  Could I get some suggestions on what things to look at  Were both running Windows 7, and while I have the 64 bit edition I dont think that should make a difference, especially since the program starts running.p  pAny advice on where to start lookingp  pemeditem  My solution depends on a custom control library which does not appear until the this.Show command that Im guessing the program fails at.  Is there a way to check if thats somehow not being included but, since it was built on my computer, the reference is working there  I ask because the publish button just names my project and not the solution as a whole, though when I build it works fine on my computer and the project has the library set as a dependency in its dependencies.p

Negative 6268 pI have a data structure like this in the database in the features table called codetokenvectorcode a hashp  precodeFeature.find1.tokenvector   a gt 0.1, b gt 0.2, c gt 0.3  codepre  pThere are 25 of these features. First, I entered the data into Redis with this in codescriptconsolecodep  precodeREDIS.set  feature1,              TokenVector.tojson Feature.find1.tokenvector    ... REDIS.set  feature25,              TokenVector.tojson Feature.find25.tokenvector   codepre  pcodeTokenVector.tojsoncode converts the hash into JSON format first. The 25 JSON hashes stored in Redis take up about 8 MB.p  pI have a method, called codeAnalysislocatecode. This method takes the dot product between two tokenvectors. The dot product for hashes works like thisp  precodehash1   a gt 1, b gt 2, c gt 3  hash2   a gt 4, b gt 5, c gt 6, d gt 7  codepre  pEach overlapping key in the hash a, b, and c in this case, and not d have their values multiplied pairwise together, then added up. p  pThe value for codeacode in codehash1code is 1, the value for codeacode in codehash2code is 4. Multiply these to get code14  4code.p  pThe value for codebcode in codehash1code is 2, the value for codebcode in codehash2code is 5. Multiply these to get code25  10code.p  pThe value for codeccode in codehash1code is 3, the value for codeccode in codehash2code is 6. Multiply these to get code36  18code.p  pThe value for codedcode in codehash1code is nonexistent, the value for codedcode in codehash2code is 7. In this case, set coded  0code for the first hash. Multiply these to get code07  0code.p  pNow add up the multiplied values. code4  10  18  0  32code. This is the dot product of hash1 and hash2.p  precodeAnalysis.locate hash1, hash2   gt 32 codepre  pI have a method that is often used, codeAnalysistopicizecode. This method takes in a parameter, codetokenvectorcode, which is just a hash, similar to above. codeAnalysistopicizecode takes the dot product of codetokenvectorcode and each of the 25 features codetokenvectorscode, and creates a new vector of those 25 dot products, called codefeaturevectorcode. A codefeaturevectorcode is just an array. Here is what the code looks likep  precodedef self.topicize tokenvector    featurevector  FeatureVector.new    featurevector.push     locate tokenvector, TokenVector.fromjson REDIS.get feature1         ...   featurevector.push     locate tokenvector, TokenVector.fromjson REDIS.get feature25         featurevector  end codepre  pAs you can see, it takes the dot product of codetokenvectorcode and each features codetokenvectorcode that I entered into Redis above, and pushes the value into an array.p  pMy problem is, this takes about 18 seconds each time I invoke the method. Am I misusing Redis I think the problem could be that I shouldnt load Redis data into Ruby. Am I supposed to send Redis the data codetokenvectorcode and write a Redis function to have it do the codedotproductcode function, rather than writing it with Ruby codep

In RDBMS, Tag and Post has manytomany relations but i understand that it has no any relationship in NoSql so post object is saved with whole members.So show tag list with post count scenario will cause to heavy query in whole post items with some effort in every query so dont i lose all benefit of NoSql power in this scenario  p  pUpdate a tag name will not cause some complex jobs  I have to query whole post items and find that  it has that tag name and update it. By the way it require multidocument transaction and long process so failing will cause  inconsistency in my db because no support for multidocument transactions in NoSql so how can i handle this p  pI am not trying to show cons of NoSql against RDBMSSql systems. I am just trying to understand my thinking is correct about this scenarious or not, there can be something that i missed or the things look bad is not bad as i thought.

Same with the difference between actual mouseclicks and my mouseevent api attempt.  What can I do or try different. Any suggestions are appreciated.

I see some sites that claim that in order for the mobile app to interact with the rails application, they turn off codeprotectfromforgerycode for JSON requests.  p  blockquote   pHow does this solve the problem of CSRF  Can a malicious site not have JSON POST request that performs undesirable changes on behalf of the userp blockquote  pSo, to solve this problem , I decided to use a custom codemimetypecode or perhaps a codespecial keycode that only the mobile app would use, and then have codeprotectfromforgerycode perform the followingp  ol liCheck if the csrf token is present as a codehidden divcode true for the web app and included by default.li liIf not present, check for this codespecial keycode or codemimetypecode.li ol  pIs there anyway to achieve this, or similar, to counter this problemp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIt turns out that I had overthought the problem.  Rails is magical and somehow handled requests coming from a mobile app automatically and appropriately without raising an exception.  So, essentially we didnt have to make any modifications at all.p  pI didnt quite check how Rails achieves this though  pedagogically speaking, this might still be interesting to know for some.p

Negative 6268 pGood morning everyone,p  pIm new to C  and already have a challenge ahead.  I have never programmed professionally, and I have a dilemma concerning the services of C.p  pWe have a service and I was wondering if there is any method to do the job automatically.  For example my service runs 24 hours a day.  Even with the property CanStop set to false, the service can sometimes occur fall, either for lack of energy, the terminal being rebooted, or any other problem.p  pThe only thing Ive tried so far is setting a method to restart the service from time to time, but this isnt good for me because it will greatly influence the performance of own work and the windows service.p  pCould someonegive me a handp  pThanks to all p
Negative 6268 pIm thinking of using global assembly level attributes to have my command line tools expose information about their command line options.p  pThe idea would be to then write a simple driver program to discover them by loading their compiled .exe files and reflecting for those attributes, orchestrating execution.p  pDoes this seem like a reasonable use of the mentioned methodsp
Negative 6268 pI have a Joomla based community site and with search engine friendly URLs activated in the backend my profiles are located under mysite.comcommunityprofileuserusername p  pI need the htaccess file to do nothing unless a URL containing communityprofileuser is found. If that string is found then it should change the link to mysite.comusername but in reality be showing the page  mysite.comcommunityprofileuserusername p  pI think this would be rewrite rule instead of redirect, but I barely know what Im talking about. Can someone please tell me what code I must place in my .htaccess file in order to change this I believe .htacces would be the best way to do what I need, but if you have another idea Im glad to hear it.p

Im looking for the equivalent of that functionality from the Android FB SDK and Ive been unable to find it so far either here on stackoverflow or on Google.p  pThe closest I did find was within the hackbook example there is an AppRequestsListener class which contains an onComplete call which takes in a Bundle object. My initial thoughts lead me to assume either the URL I mentioned above or the request IDs themselves are within this bundle however Im unsure how to extract these pieces of information. p  pHas anyone done this before and know what I need to do Any help would be appreciated. p

Negative 6268 pIn one particular project, were trying to embed version information into shared object files. Wed like to be able to use some standard linux tool to parse the shared object to determine the version for automated testing. Currently I have const int pluginversion  14.  I can use nm and objdump and verify that its therep  precode00000000000dcfbc r pluginversion codepre  pI cant, however, seem to be able to get the value of that variable easily from command line.  I figured thered be a POSIX tool for showing the initialized values for globals.  I have contemplated using a format for the variable as the information itself, ie, pluginversion14, but that seems like a huge hack.  Embedding the information in the filename unfortunately is NOT an option.  Any other suggestions welcome.p

Negative 6268 pLike many developers, my iOS app was just rejected for having downloadable content that was being backed up to iCloud. Ive searched for a clear answer to this question but have not been able to get one.p  pApple says that you should implement a do not backup attribute to your files, however, they also state a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1719index.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1719index.htmlap  pThe new do not back up attribute will only be used by iOS 5.0.1 or later. On iOS 5.0 and earlier, applications will need to store their data in LibraryCaches to avoid having it backed up. Since this attribute is ignored on older systems, you will need to insure your app complies with the iOS Data Storage Guidelines on all versions of iOS that your application supports.p  pMy app supports iOS 4.0 and later. Does this mean if I want to maintain support for iOS 4.05.0, I have no choice but to put all my content into the Caches folder Or, can I just add the do not backup attribute and keep the files in Documents If I have to keep the content in the Caches folder, can I prevent these files from being purged in low storage situations Finally, are there any developers who have put files in the Caches folder and know how often they do get purgedp  pAny advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lotp

Negative 6268 pI have a WPF app that draws a compass. There is a large ring with tick marks and labels. I have a checkbox that toggles the compass graphics on and off. When I first start up the app, the compass turns on and off instantly.p  pMeanwhile, I have a combo box that grabs some data from a local database and uses that to render some overlay graphics. After using this combo box, the compass graphics no longer toggle quickly. In fact, the UI completely freezes for about 4 seconds whenever I click the checkbox.p  pI attempted to profile my app using Window Performance Profiling Tool for WPF. When I activated the checkbox, not only did my app freeze, so did the profiler. The graphs catched up afterward, but this tells me something must be seriously wrong.p  pIve managed to nail down that the problem graphics are the tick marks not the numeric labels. If I eliminate them, the freezing problem stops. If I cut them down from 360 to, say, 36, the app still freezes, but for less time. Again, no matter how many tick marks I have, they toggle instantly when the app first starts.p  pMy question is, strongHow do I figure out why the toggle for my compass graphics goes from instant to horribly slowstrong Ive tried extensive profiling and debugging, and I just cant come up with any reason why setting the Visibility on some tick marks should ever cause the app to freeze.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pOkay, Ive stripped everything out of my app to just the bare essentials, zipped it up, and uploaded it to Sendspace. Here is the link its about 143Kp  pa hrefhttpwww.sendspace.comfilen1u3yg relnofollowhttpwww.sendspace.comfilen1u3ygap  p[strongNotestrong dont accidentally click the banner ad, the real download link is much smaller and lower on the page.]p  pTwo requestsp  ol lipstrongDo you experience the problem on your machinestrong Try opening Compass.exe in binRelease and clicking the check box rapidly. The compass tick marks should turn on and off with no delay. Then, select an item from the combo box and try rapidly clicking the check box again. On my machine, its very laggy, and after I stop rapidfire clicking, it takes a few seconds for the graphics to catch up.pli lipIf you do experience the lag, strongdo you see anything in the code that could be causing this odd behaviorstrong The combo box is not connected to anything, so why should selecting an item from it affect the future performance of other graphics on the windowpli ol
Negative 6268 pOne thing I notice i javascript  jquery web architectures is that it seems very easy for exceptions to get swallowed and go unnoticed. Im thinking what would be really good is if anytime your web tier had a javascript exception, information about it was sent on a AJAX request back to your server so at least you could log information about it.p  pI am wondering there has to be some framework feature that already does this as I think it would be a really useful feature. Anyone know of any framework, feature or library that will do thisp  pThanksp

Negative 6268 pWe have a timeline feature of our software. It shows rows of little blobs which indicate data at different points of time. The code is c, .Net 4 and WPF. To show a blob, we are currently creating a border emgiving it a brushem and adding it to a grid.

There are two projects a Rails project and a project that is a rails engine which contains my models.  I dont load the rails engine itself with my resque jobs I just use the snippet above in a separate class to load active record on the models.  This always worked until I added some STI models which because of the naming caused the children to attempt to be loaded before the parent. The rails engine project loads just fine in the rails project no issues there this is just because I am trying to use active record outside of a rails project.  p

Negative 6268 pOur website has around 50,000 users and daily active traffic is pretty good. We are designing a new notifications feature for our user base.p  pOur requirement is as followsp  ol liUsers are part of different Groups.li liA user can be part of multiple Groups.li liWhen a user uploads a image in a group, all the members of that particular group should get a notification saying new image uploaded regardless of being online or offline.li ol  pWe thought of creating rabbitmq exchanges for each group and queue for each user. But got confused going forward of designing the right wayp  pSay, a user should receive notifications even he logsin to site days after the notifications is generated. We ended up storing the messages in DB which is not a good thing at all for offline users.p  pCan someone suggest proper design pattern with explanation for this use case We are using celery  rabbitmq  tornado. Should tornado talk directly to the celery consumer Where do the messages get stored when the user is offlinep
Negative 6268 pSo Google went ahead and published a change to the build.xml Android uses in R20, deleting the classpath variable I was depending on in my project. Now it looks like its usingp  precodeproject.target.class.path codepre  pso Im using this in my build.xml with the latest SDK tools installed on my machine, and everything is peachy on my end... but my remote Jenkins server no likey. To solve my problem on both ends I figured Id just pull out the code that sets this attribute from the Android build.xml, and set my own property. The bit of code in the Android build.xml which appears to be setting this property is this chunk in the buildsetup targetp  precodeltgettarget      androidJarFileOutproject.target.android.jar      androidAidlFileOutproject.target.framework.aidl      bootClassPathOutproject.target.class.path      targetApiOutproject.target.apilevel      minSdkVersionOutproject.minSdkVersion gt codepre  pIm assuming this is a macro, but the whole chunk of code glows red brighter than Rudolphs nose in a snowstorm when Im looking at it in IntelliJ. Where is this thing being definedp

Negative 6268 pThis is not a question specific about some javascript detail but Im looking for validation that there are no obvious holes in the model that Ive created. I decided to roll my own authentication routine except for using a bcrypt to hash in the backend which will work like thisp  ol liUser browser or phonegap created native app signs up  Json object posted using jQuery ajax to backend that uses bcrypt to handle the password and save the password user profile datali liBackend generates, saves with client IP address a token which it returns random hash, like devurandomli lijQuery plugin stores the token to a local cookieli liWhen some request is made post, comment, whatever but not too often it gets the token from the cookie and adds that to the json and posts it again with ajaxli liBackend checks that the token exists and has not expired valid for 7 days, checks that the ipaddress is the same and if ok validates the request json data and processes the requestli liWhen a token has expired a login screen is shown and credentials posted as ajax and a new token created as in step 2.li ol  pEverything goes through ssl for ajax requests and no passwords are stored anywhere. There is also a mechanism checking for brute force token spamming blocking the source ip temporarily if threshold exceeded. This is not a high security app but want to respect users data and make sure its secure enough.p  pI hope the question qualifies even though its not specific and work as a reference for someone else if it will spark some discussion. I couldnt find any best practice tutorials on this particular approach.p  pUPDATE The authentication mechanism updated according to the feedback received as it seems to be secure enough for a noncritical web application.p

Negative 6268 pSorry for the rather ignorant question, but Im a bit confused regarding these two technologies. I wrote a webserver in C that uses Fleck and everything works great but I realized I probably couldnt find a hosting provider that would run .NET applications.p  pI want to use websockets and I found socket.io to be really popular but Im not sure exactly what it is. Correct me if Im wrong, but, is it just like writing a server in javascript and you run the javascript file with the codenode.execode application and then the server is running How do people find hosting providers that will provide that sort of servicep  pLastly, is socket.io just an extension of nodejs Do you have to code your server in javascript when you use socket.io Again, sorry for the very novice questions but Im just trying to understand a few basic things before I continue.

Negative 6268 pIm developing an application, that allows using dictionaries e.g. EnglishGerman. I want to enable periodic tile updates for my application at start screen. I want to show random word with translation from random dictionary, so all I want to do is just show 2 strings I found an appropriate template for it. I can show the notification once using  codeTileUpdateManager.CreateTileUpdaterForApplication.AddToSchedulecode but I want it to happen say every minute. I only found examples that use  codeTileUpdateManager.CreateTileUpdaterForApplication.StartPeriodicUpdatecode method and they all use some web address. Is there any way to make it happen using just my local strings without accessing cloud or somethingp

Negative 6268 pI have a server which feeds several applications.p  pPlease imagine that Im a user registered in 2 or more of those applications and I use one different login info when accessing each one.p  pNow, as that user, I use the same browser with different tabs to access those applications... Logging the first time for the 1rst application everything goes as intended, but when I access the 2nd application as the second user, that request will access the same coderequest.sessioncode object. When I invoke the login from the auth framework the current user will be compared with the user in the actual coderequest.sessioncode coderequest.session[SESSIONKEY]  user.idcode and coderequest.session.flushcode will be called.p  pThis means that I will loose all of the coderequest.sessioncode content for the user that accessed the 1st application, and that same user coderequest.sessioncode will be marked to be the second user coderequest.sessioncode from that point.p  pWhat I wanted, in this situation, was to have a functionmethod that permits to create a new coderequest.sessioncode for the second user, leaving the original as it is.p  pstrongEdited after the first answerstrong First of all, thank you for the answer.  I was trying not to detail too much in order to avoid too oriented answers, but now I think I should do itp  pOk, Ive called it applications before, but in truth, my project serves requests in order to offer the same final product a game, for instance.  I have several django applications inside my project. Each one with specific orientations and backends depending of business considerations applied.p  pIt would be more detailed if I told that I have different entry points URLs, use the correct business backend in order to process the request and retrieve a game. p  pMy main URL is the same namespace and my project has only one settings file.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtXsrB.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 6268 pThis question is a point of curiosity, as one of the two programs below works.p  pIm using ImageMagick to resize a number of photos. To save a bit of time, I work on each photo in its own thread, and use a semaphore to limit the number of threads working simultaneously. Originally I allowed every thread to run at once, but the script would quickly allocate 3.5 GB for all the photos I only have 2GB available, and the script would run 5x slower than normal because of all the swapping to disk.p  pThe working, semaphore version code looks something like thisp  precodeuse threads use ThreadSemaphore use ImageMagick  my s  ThreadSemaphoregtnew4 foreach  photos       threadsgtcreate amplaunchthread, s   foreach my thr  reverse threadsgtlist       thrgtjoin   sub launchthread      my s  shift     sgtdown     my image  ImageMagickgtnew       do memoryheavy work here      sgtup  codepre  pThis quickly allocates 500MB, and runs quite nicely without ever requiring more. The threads are joined in reverse order to make a point. p  pI wondered if there might be overhead from launching 80 threads simultaneously and blocking most of them, so I altered my script to block the main threadp  precodemy s  ThreadSemaphoregtnew4 foreach  photos       sgtdown     threadsgtcreate amplaunchthread, s   foreach my thr  threadsgtlist       thrgtjoin   sub launchthread      my s  shift     my image  ImageMagickgtnew       do memoryheavy work here      sgtup  codepre  pThis version starts fine, but gradually accumulates the 3.5GB of space the original version used. Its faster than running all threads at once, but still quite a bit slower than blocking threads.p  pMy first guess was that the memory used by a thread isnt freed until join is called on it, and as its the main thread that blocks, no threads are freed until theyve all been allocated. However, in the first, working version, the threads pass the guard in a moreorless random order, but join in reverse order. If my guess is correct, then, many more than the four running threads should be waiting to be joined at any time, and this version should be slower as well.p  pSo why are these two versions so differentp

So I would have to change the  emcom.sun.faces.mgbean.BeanBuilder.buildem methodp  precodepublic Object buildInjectionProvider injectionProvider, FacesContext context    Object bean  newBeanInstance   injectResourcesbean, injectionProvider   buildBeanbean, context   if bean instanceof SomeInterface  false      invokePostConstructbean, injectionProvider      return bean  codepre  p.. afterwards in emMyManagedBeanELResolverems revoleBean registered in facesconfig.xml as elresolver methodp  precoderesult  manager.createbeanName, builder, facesContext if result instanceof SomeInterface    SomeInterface result.setValue...   builder.invoktePostConstructresult  codepre  pIs there a better solution to itp  pstrongUPDATE why I cant use the PhaseListener proposed by kolossusstrongbr I cannot use the viewId to fetch the ManagedBean because I would like to have emnem types of Bean currently active, each accessed by their bean name.p  pI have a 1n relation between viewId and ManagedBean, e.g. I have a emtest.jsfem which has the backingbean emTestBeanem. Its also possible that a emTestBean0em exists which is the, lets say, a copy of emTestBeanem but with a different value which I need to inject, e.g. a userId. My emtest.jsfem together with a emControllerBeanem is able to determine which ManagedBean should be accessed, either the emTestBeanem or emTestBean0em, which shows either the content from the emTestBeanem e.g. userId27 or TestBean0 e.g. userId33.br This allows me to have the em1em view emtest.jsfem with emnem models emTestBeanem displayed at in the same page at the same time, e.g my test.html looks like this.p  precode.... lthoutputText valuecontrollerBean.getBeantestBean, component.name gt ltfsubview idsomeIdgt   ltuiinclude srcWEBINFtemplatestest.xhtml gt ltfsubviewgt .... codepre  pSo therefore I can have a recursion depth of the recursion is 1 in this case, where the outputText from the level 0 shows the name Your userId is 27 and the included test.xhtmls outputText shows Your userId is 33.p

Negative 6268 pEverything shown below is purely pseudocode to illustrate my problem.p  pMy code has the following data structuresp  precode Used to define the ORDERS a customer has placed ListltOrdersgt myOrders Orders    String name   double quantity   String location    there are only 2 possible locations    Used to define the ITEMS we have available Item    String name   ListltPartsgt parts    Used to define the PARTS to make an ITEM Parts    String name   double quantity  codepre  pThe general breakdown seems nice and clear, but the customer requirements is where I am having issues and I am not sure how to best resolve the problem... NOTE  I know using NAME and not an ID is bad to correlate  but this is a legacy system.p  pWhat I need to generate is the following  list of all PARTS by item needed from each LOCATION only two possible and the actual quantity defined by the orders  display this on the screen to be printed  obviously you can have multiple order for the same parts at the same location and they should be added together to get a total.p  pSo what I need to do  take each order and find the item  take each item and find the parts  for each part define its location from order and multiply by quantity from order and that is the  of parts for this locationp  pThe end result should be something like this table grid form headersp  precode    Item    Part    QuantityLocation1   QuantityLocation2     itm1      A         1                    0               B         4                    2     itm2      C         0                    5 codepre  pThe issue being that obvious the PART class has no such concept as LOCATION...p  pAnyone have any suggestions The only solution I can see right now seems horrible ... create a new class like PartswithLocation, add the location to it, and then recreate all the ITEM objects that already exist with this PartsWithLocation, then I can do some magic ORDER by ORDER to find the parts and based on Location and multiply in the quantity. The end result is a new List that I can then display in a grid or something WPF...

Negative 6268 pI am working on a project where performance is a key factor for success. I need to decide whether to use POCO entity generator or not. I might use entityclassgeneration instead of the POCO but Im not sure if performance may be affected. p  pAnother thing I should consider is the fact of having to work with stored procedures.

Negative 6268 pQuick info I am using Visual Studio 2008, Windows 8 64bit.p  pI am trying to creating an AutoPlay Handler that presents itself when a WPD device is plugged into the computer. If my AutoPlay option is selected, all I want it to do is to simply launch my application.p  pSince there arent any recent examples of implementing AutoPlay for Windows, I was hoping someone could help me out a little and answer a couple of questionsp  p1. I have created an ATL project with a COM object that implements the IHWEventHandler interface.

I build my COM object for 64bit windows, and register the .dll using regsvr32.exe as well, but this does not seem to help.p  p2. Also, I am suspecting that perhaps I did not register my AutoPlay registry keys correctly. I first manually added my Autoplay event handler like sop  pHKEYLOCALMACHINE  SOFTWARE  Microsoft  Windows  CurrentVersion  Explorer  AutoPlayHandlers  Handlers  MyAutoPlayHandlerp  pMyAutoPlayHandler holds the followingp  pAction REGSZ MyActionp  pDefaultIcon REGSZ directory to my application iconp  pInvokeProgID REGSZ name of key under HKEYCLASSESROOT that was generated by my ATL project AutoPlayExericesCom.SimpleAutoPlayCom.1p  pInvokeVerb REGSZ openp  pProvider REGSZ Myselfp  pThen I added MyAutoPlayHandler to the followingp  pHKEYLOCALMACHINE  SOFTWARE  Microsoft  Windows  CurrentVersion  Explorer  AutoPlayHandlers  EventHandlers  WPD  Function  2D8A6512A74C448EBA8AF4AC07C49399 which is WPDFUNCTIONALCATEGORYALLp  pCool, so I plug in my Android device, and I see my AutoPlay entry in the AutoPlay list. I click it, and nothing happens no txt file was created in the C drive as I was expecting.p  pSo I Additionally create another key like the followingp  pHKEYCLASSESROOT  MyAutoPlayDropHandler  shell  open  DropTargetp  pWhere DropTarget Contains a CLSID value with the CLSID idea of the COM object I created. I change the InvokeProgID to point to this key, but still nothing happens. p  pFor experimentation, I tried adding my handler under the ShowPicturesOnArrival key, and when plugging in a USB drive containing images, then selecting my AutoPlay Entry, I got the following error messagep  pThis file does not have a program associated with it to perform this action. Please install a program or, if on is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel.p  pSo now I have some kind of error response to the ShowPicturesOnArrival key, but why nothing for the WPD Im suspecting Im missing something somewhere to get this to work, but I am running out of ideas. Any suggestions that I could try to fix this would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 6268 pI have been asked to update an existing wizard that presents a linear sequence of questions to users.  I was given the task of updating this wizard by referring to a flowchart that was provided by the client.  The flowchart departs significantly from the current flow.  Given that everything is currently hardcoded with question numbers and valid answers it is going to be very difficult to sort out the changes required.br This made me wonder what sort of technique people would use to model a flowchartwizard of questions and answers.  Ive seen reference to using a finite state machine but this does not seem to be a good fit.  Im looking for a technique that would allow for easily moving, inserting, and deleting existing questions without having to sort through a collection of hardcoded references.  Ive considered using an array that would be loaded via a CSV but am not certain this would be easily maintainable as the list of questions grows.br Note that a pending request is to also allow for jumping into and out of the wizard at any point depending upon the flow of the conversation. To avoid the question is too broad response Im looking for a specific pattern or technique that has been specifically created for this use not a list of possibilities. Thanksp

Negative 6268 h2Backgroundh2  pI have to use Roboguice for an app, which handles a lot of injections on many classes.p  pThe app also has a splash screen class which extends from RoboSplashActivity .p  h2The problemh2  pAs the app got more and more complex, more time was spent on the splash screen activity, and it even shows its content layout after a while , meaning the user sees a blank screen about 12 seconds before there is even a splash image.p  h2What Ive triedh2  pAt the beginning I thought it was because the splash image was too have since it had multiple layers of images so I tried setting a simple color. Turns out its not the reason.p  pThen I thought that it might be that the app takes a lot of space, so I created a totally new project with the same size, and it worked fine. so a large app isnt the reason for slow start up.p  pThen I thought that its the RoboSplashActivitys fault, so Ive replaced it with a new activity extending Activity instead  that only shows a solid color background. the background showed after a while , almost the same time as using RoboSplashActivity . Still not the reason for the blank screen.p  pNow what I think is that its Roboguices fault, and that I should somehow delay its initialization to the time that something is shown on the screen, so that at least the user will see something while its loading.p  h2The questionh2  pIs it possible to optimize Roboguice to have the minimal start time p  pMaybe delay its initialization that is done on other files p

However, this still leaves a table that could potentially have 100 columns.p  pIve come up with two ways of handling this though Im not sure which to usep  pstrong1strong.

Break it down into maybe 1520 separate dedicated tables.p  pstrongOption 1strong seems the quickest as it involves the fewest joins but the idea of a table with 100 columns doesnt feel right.p  pstrongOption 2strong feels better and would break things down in to more managable chunks but it wont save any database space and will increase the number of joins. Pretty much all the columns in the database will have a value and I cannot normalise these columns any further.p  pMy question is, in this situation is it acceptable to have a table with c.100 columns in it or should I try and break it down over several tables for presentationp  pstrongPlease notestrong The table structure will not change over the course of its useage, a new database would be created for a new version of the web service portal. I have no control over the web service data structure.p  pstrongEditstrong Odeds answer below has made me think a bit more about how the data will be accessed it will really only be accessed in whole and not in part. I wouldnt for example, need to return columns 520 on a regular basis.p  pstrongAnswerstrong I accepted Odeds answer based on the comments after he posted it helped me make my mind up and I decided to go with option 1. As the data is accessed in full then having one table seems the better solution. If, for example, I regularly wanted to access columns 520 rather than the full table row then Id see about breaking it up into separate tables for performance reasons. p

Negative 6268 pIm creating a puppet rig for an animation I am making. Ive created two custom classes that inherit from the MovieClip class. One is the head Im animating facing the camera and another is the 34ths view of the same head. Ive modified both constructors to add an event listener that calls the function codefacRigcode which helps me animate the heads by calling other functions like codemoveEyes, moveMouthcode etc.p  precodepublic function FMichaelFULLHEAD      super     faceRigOverLoad ltbug workaround     this.gotoAndPlayMovieCliproot.currentFrame Sync movieclips with timeline     addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME,faceRig  codepre  pHowever, the function is always called one frame after the codeMovieClipcode appears in the timeline. This delay makes animating impossible because I have to constantly switch between the front view and the 34ths view I switch by making a new keyframe in the timeline and dragging the symbol from the library. Every time I switch there is one frame where the mouth is not talking and the eyes are not moving.p  pThe bug workaround kinda solves the problem. Now first time either head appears on stage it begins animating immediately, but if I switch from the front view to the 34ths view back to the front view, the front view gets delayed again.p  pI suspected this might be because the constructor doesnt get run again so i tried to make each instance of the heads unique by naming them codefrontHead1code and codefrontHead2code in the objects property box, however it didnt help at all.p

Negative 6268 pAs a test I tried making a codeltdivgtcode appear as a circle. The codeltdivgtcode has some text inside of it but otherwise is empty.p  pThen in JavaScript I calculate the codeoffsetWidthcode and codeoffsetHeightcode, use the maximum of the two, and assign it to a variable named codediametercode although realistically the width would probably always be larger.

I have not tested IE.p  pTesting in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari I noticed that this behaves differently for CSS codehovercode and JavaScript codeonmousedowncode when the cursor is just outside the area of the circle but inside the area of the rectangle that would be visible if codeborderradiuscode was not set. p  pHeres the results when the cursor is in that spotp  ul liChrome codehovercode and codeonmousedowncode affected outside the circleli liFirefox codehovercode and codeonmousedowncode only affected inside the circleli liOpera codehovercode and codeonmousedowncode affected outside the circleli liSafari codehovercode and codeonmousedowncode affected outside the circleli ul  pThe behavior Firefox has is the one Id like to consistently use, is there a way to make this possiblep  pstrongEditstrong If you find a solution please explain what browser you are using.p

Negative 6268 pI have been playing around with PDCurses and have been having a few problems.   Eventually I landed a hrefhttpssourceforge.netppdcursesdiscussion95731threadf3564621limit25837 relnofollowherea which had a solution to my problem.p  pBasically my PDCurses project was compiled with the UNICODE CHARACTER set.  As a result the block character was being displayed as an upper case U.  Setting the library to NOT SET as the character set solved this problem.p  pstrongIs there a technique that would allow me to embed something in the source code for PDCurses that would detect which character set option was picked and do a compile time ASSERT if it is not set properlystrong   p  pI have looked at the pragma listing.  The conform option and runtime checks seem to do something similar.p
Negative 6268 pI am trying to track down a race condition and all signs seem to be pointing to codeConcurrentHashMap.putIfAbsentcode. Is it possible that if 2 threads call codeputIfAbsentcode on an empty map with the same key that both could do their lookup to see that the key does not exist yet so both threads then try to add it For some reason when I first started using codeputIfAbsentcode I did not think the call would need to be synchronized. But now I cant see how it would prevent both threads from adding their values if the timing was right. I have not been able to reproduce this outside of production.p  pThanksp

Negative 6268 pIm currently reading the Oreilly Clojure programming book which its says the following in its section about lazy sequencesp  blockquote   pIt is possible though very rare for a lazy sequence to know its length, and therefore return it as the result of count without realizing its contents.p blockquote  pMy question is, How this is done and why its so rarep  pUnfortunately, the book does not specify these things in this section. I personally think that its very useful to know the length of a lazy sequence prior its realization, for instance, in the same page is an example of a lazy sequence of files that are processed with a function using codemapcode.

Negative 6268 pIve got a MediaElement.js player with a video loaded into it, and I have a databasedriven function which, given a time offset within that video, gives me the actual realworld time at which that part of the video represents.p  pI.e., if the video consists of 2 30second clips, the first of which was recorded Tuesday morning, and the second of which was recorded Thursday evening, the function Ive got will take an input of 25.2 and return a particular time on Tuesday morning, or itll take an input of 44.6 and return a time on Thursday evening.  And so on.p  pMy question is Is it possible for me to intercept the bits of MediaElement that are used to display time e.g. the floating div that shows the time offset when youre hovering over the time rail, and so on, and have them use my function to determine what to display  Ideally, Id like to do this without modifying the MEJS code itself, if possible.p  pThanksp

Negative 6268 pIn a normal DDD project I expect the Entities retrieved from a repository to be sent from the Domain Layer to the Application Layer as a DTO.p  pIt seems that one reason of CQRS to exist is that the queries needed by the application layer mostly read operations are different from the ones needed by the domain layer. So it seems that even a query result of the same object might be different among layers.p  pWithin my domain layer I am already mapping query results into domain entities. I am confused about some CQRS examples mapping query results straight into DTOs skipping their matching entities.p  pSuppose that a database returnsp  precodeperson    id 5323423,   name John,   familyname Smith   ...  codepre  pHowever the entity layout maps emfamily nameem as emsurnameemp  precodeclass Person     Identity id    String name    String surname  codepre  pIf this happens in some CQRS examples I have seen, the extracted DTO will look different, causing a conflict when matching an entity with its DTO. How are these conflicts resolved It looks to me that any DTO related with an Entity should always be generated from its Entity. However in that case, the freedom to perform different type of queries in the Application Layer is lost.p

Negative 6268 pstrongThe Contextstrong I have implemented a Test Suite using Java, JUnit and Selenuim WebDriver to automate the testing of a Web Application.  The Test Suite is deployed as a Maven Job within Jenkins which rebuilds on changes to the TestSuite or SUT.  Jenkins also runs the TestSuite for a number of toplevel maven jobs for test cases to continuously test the target system using different browsers, both on a schedule and on demand.  The Surefire plugin is used to make the test results visible and Emma plugin for Test Coverage.p  pWhen a JUnit Test fails i.e. detects a bug in the SUT, not a test suite error the suite takes a screen shot of the Browser which it persists into a folder under the Jenkins workspace.  The screen shot filename is a UUID  which is recorded in the test log.  This all works very well overall.p  pstrongThe Questionstrong The screen shots are visible by drilling into the workspace via Jenkins UI.  However this is a clumsy mechanism.  I want to find a way within the Jenkins UI to hyperlink either the Surefire results andor the console output to the specific screen shot.  e.g. by clicking the UUID in the log.p

Negative 6268 pI was wondering if there were some gurus here who could help me with the following problem.p  pI have a Siemens S71200 PLC that I am accessing via HTTP and the builtin web server in the PLC. The PLC has been set up with a very simple web page that has two tags on it inside a HTML FORM so that the page can be loaded and new values for the tags written to the PLC.  This has been tested from a browser and works well.p  pThen I have a Java application which connects to the PLC 23 times each hour, loads the page with a GET, writes a new value into either tag field a value of 1 and then POSTs the page back to the web server.  This also works well.p  pHowever, before the page with the tag fields can be loaded, the HTTP client must log in with a userpass via another page in the PLC web server.  The Java application actually does this and then gets the tag page, updates a tag and posts the page.p  pThe problem is that this will run fine for weeks and then suddenly the web server will start returning error 500 during the login phasep  p500 INTERNAL SERVER ERRORp  pTurning the PLC off and back on makes everything start working again, but this is still not good because the PLC and Java app are supposed to ring a school bell on a certain schedule and when this problem occurs everyone will sit there waiting for it to ring, but it doesnt p  pNot a lot of info to go on, I know, I was mostly hoping someone else had had a similar problem and had some insight into why that occurred.  I am not a PLC expert so I dont know if there is a log or anything like that on the PLC that could be studied.p  pFor further info, I am using the Apache HTTP client library to talk to the PLC web server from the Java app.p  pThanks in advance,p  pHordur Thordarsonp

Negative 6268 pI have already implemented a configuration windowJSP for a Liferay 6.1 portlet.  The changes done in this configuration JSP are persisted in the portlets preferences while running through the processAction method of the according ConfigurationAction and the configuration JSP is rendered again.  How can I achieve it that the parent JSP becomes aware of the previously stored changes  In my case I have a parent JSP with a search form and a result list DIV below.  When I open the configuration JSP which opens in a popup window and set a property to make the search form invisible this shall be done immediately after closing the configuration JSP popup window using the X button in the upper right corner.  This means that if the search form was displayed initially and when then configuring the portlet to hide the search form the parent JSP needs to be reloaded and reading the preferences which should tell the JSP to hide the search form.p  pHow can I achieve thisp

Negative 6268 pI have an application running on several mobile phones. Id like to share the current position of each phone with the others and updating this location when they move. I thought creating an external database mysql and asking the application to send its current location geoPoint to the database every 5 seconds for example. Is it the best way to proceed If many many phones run this application, it will cause a lot of requests to the database at the same time... Do you have any idea about the best way to do thatp  pThanks a lotp
Negative 6268 pIve read the various MSDN pages on C Interop with PInvoke a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms235282.aspxherea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryfzhhdwae28vvs.11029.aspxherea but I am still confused. p  pI have some large arrays of doubles that I need to get into native code, and some resulting arrays that need to get back. I do not know the sizes of the output arrays in advance. For simplicity, I will use only a single array in the example. The platform is x64 I read that marshalling internals are quite different between 32 and 64bit environments so this might be important.p  pC p  precode    [DllImportNativeLib.dll]     public static extern void ComputeSomethingdouble[] inputs, int inlen,          [Out] out IntPtr outputs, [Out] out int outlen      [DllImportNativeLib.dll]     public static extern void FreeArrayIntPtr outputs      public void Computedouble[] inputs, out double[] outputs                         IntPtr outputptr         int outlen         ComputeSomethinginputs, inputs.Length, out outputptr, out outlen          outputs  new double[outlen]         Marshal.Copyoutputptr, outputs, 0, outlen          FreeArrayoutputptr      codepre  pC p  precodeextern C       void ComputeSomethingdouble inputs, int inputlength,          double outputs, int outputlength          ...     outputlength  ...     outputs  new double[outputlength]     ...           void FreeArraydouble outputs              delete[] outputs       codepre  pIt works, that is, I can read out the doubles I wrote into the array on the C side. However, I wonder p  ul liIs this really the right way to use PInvokeli liArent my signatures needlessly complicatedli liCan PInvoke be used more efficiently to solve this problem li liI believe I read that marshalling for single dimensional arrays of builtin types can be avoided. Is there a way around Marshal.Copyli ul  pNote that we have a working CCli version, but there are some problems related to local statics in thirdparty library code that lead to crashes. a hrefhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails336844staticvariableinnativemethodcausesexceptionc0020001duringprocessexitMicrosoft marked this issue as WONTFIXa, which is why I am looking for alternatives.p
Negative 6268 pI am writing a Java batch which is listening messages from a queue Oracle AQ and sending them to another queue Tibco EMS, where they are processed by a Tibco process BW.p  pThe problem is that the Oracle AQ driver automatically add some properties to messages JMSXGroupID, JMSXGroupSeq which cause errors when they are processed by Tibco process because they have bad values  JMSXGroupSeq should be an int but is set to null. Tibco falls into error when trying to parse message properties...p  pSo I would like to remove only these 2 properties from all messages but it seems that the jms api only offers a clearProperties method but no single property remove method Im using ths javax.jms.Message interface.p  pFor now, I can see two solutions p  ol lipset a correct value to these 2 properties, as Im assuming they will not be used further by Tibcopli lipread all properties and reconstruct the messages without the 2 which cause problem.

Negative 6268 pYou can test by yourself by cloning this repo a hrefhttpsgithub.comseyioskeyboardtest relnofollowhttpsgithub.comseyioskeyboardtesta. p  pThe problem is the followingbr When you enter text in a codeUITextFieldcode and you want to quickly tap a button which position is close to the keyboard the button does not receive touch event at first. You need to wait a small amount of time before tapping on the button does anything.  p  pIn the linked project the button action is set to clear the text field. If you enter text and touch the button quickly you will see that the text field does not get cleared and youll have to touch the button again. If you tap on the button that is on top of the text field not close to the keyboard everything work as expected.  p  pI suspect this is a bug from Apple. And I suspect this comes from the fact that some keys on the keyboard show other keys when you long press them such as E, U. And maybe a hidden frame prevents from touching the button immediately after entering text. p  pMy questions are  p  ul liCan you reproduce the bug   And do you know if this has already beenli lireported with a workaround or elseli ul  p[EDIT] Please test in landscape mode.p

Im not worried about the 10hour bits, as I can calculate that easily enough with a BCD conversion loop I think. p  pI earlier used the bitwise OR operator in C to augment the original hours data to 24.

Negative 6268 pIll refer to this ticket as step in the right direction for what I needp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9418309jquerymobilenotloadingnewpagescriptsjQuery mobile not loading new page scriptsap  pOne of the answers states that any code NOT nested in the first code[datarolepage]code tag in jQuery  mobile will NOT show up in the html. I dont know if maybe this is a browser quirk or not but regardless, the code IS getting run despite it NEVER showing up. I find this difficult if I want to debug the js code since I cant add break points to any of it.p  pIve also had a problem with using the Jquery autocomplete plugin as it only works ONE time and then after submitting the form and returning the the form it no longer works. I believe this is because the page well a partial piece of it by jquery mobile gets reloaded and the autocomplete plugin is no longer bound to my textbox. Ive tried using the codelivecode and codeoncode methods to make sure they get rebound but this doesnt work.p  pCan any javascriptjquery mobile geniuses out there help me out with this problem Thanksp

Negative 6268 pI have a strange situation.  I have a new web project in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  p  pI right clicked on it and went to Add Existing Items to add a couple of .css files from an existing project that are exactly what I need.  Hovering over these they now show saved in my new project folder.  When I compile the project I receive validation css 2.1 errors for these files.  When clicking on the errors it does not open up the file in the project.  Instead it opens up the .css file from the path of the old project.  I cant figure out why.  p  pId love to make these errors go away butp  ol liIt would be nice if I could click on the errors to open up the file that really needs corrected.li liEven after modifying the line in both the old and new and recompiling I still get the error.  For instance I am gettingli ol  pError   1   Validation CSS 2.1 width is not a valid value for the pagebreakinside property.

Negative 6268 pIm trying to figure out some specifics of using a normalized representation for floatingpoint values.p  pAs I understand, the IEEE754 representation works likep  precode1.significand  2exponent codepre  pFor single precision, the significand being 24 bits, the exponent being 8 bits.p  pWhat Im trying to break this down to is essentially the number of slots available in each range of numbers supported by the exponent, such asp  precode[Exponent0] 0.0  1.0  223 values [Exponent1] 1.0  2.0  223 values [Exponent2] 2.0  4.0  223 values [Exponent3] 4.0  8.0  223 values codepre  pIm trying to demonstrate that in using quantisation if the range Im interested in is limited to 0.0  1.0, I can use 224 bits to represent this number and there will be no loss of precision in removing the exponent and this can be easily converted to a full floatingpoint representation. Also, to clearly illustrate the greater precision closer to zero than further away when using floatingpoint, as it feels like this may be quite intuitive to understand. p  pOne area in particular that Im not quite clear on is where the supported exponent is 127 to 126, how does the negative portion work 1.5  21 clearly overlaps with the 0.0  1.0 range. p  pFinally, I know that one of the bits in the significand is used for the sign, however what does the hidden bit represent, does this affect the number of slots that are available in each rangep

But there is one exception that I have where I struggle with. My database model is designed to have a onetoone relationship between the codeuserscode table and the codeuserprofilescode table by looking at the foreign key codeuseridcode in the codeuserprofilescode table. This means that it is acting on a emidentifying relationshipem, so it doesnt have an own primary key, it actually borrows the key of the codeuserscode table.p  pNow, I want to update the codeUserProfilecode model through the codeUserProfileControllercode that gets called when the following example URL is entered codehttpapi.projectX.dev8000v1usersid of the userprofilecode. But Laravel forces me to have a URL like this codehttpapi.projectX.dev8000v1usersid of the userprofilesome other useless IDcode.p  pIs there any way to magically remove that last ID from the resources route and just take advantage of the first IDp  pI hope that somebody can help me with this, because finding the answer to this question is actually pretty hard to find right now.p

For which I normally take all the phone numbers each time and check for the sync.

In this way we can differentiate the synced and unsynced numbersp  pThanks in advance.p

It would be nice if I could get the sub items for multiple items in the stack at the same time, and populate my return list faster.

Negative 6268 pIm looking to read data off the wire and send it to a function to parse the contents.  Due to the potential varying size of the message xml, i could read a whole message, more than one message, or a message portion.

Negative 6268 pHi all so Im trying to work with this set of data that has two columns, one is names and the other is the number of births for each name. What I want to do is import a csv file, perform some basic functions on it such as finding the baby name with the maximum number of births, and then plotting the data in a bar graph. But, when I have an index value for the dataframe, the bar graph prints that as the x axis instead of the names. So I removed the index and now I get all kinds of errors. Below is my code, first the one with the index and then the one without. Thanks in advance. This is really driving me crazy p  precodeimport pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pdb import matplotlib as p import os from pandas import DataFrame Location  os.path.joinos.path.sep,Users, Marks Computer,Desktop,projects,data,births1880.csv a  pd.readcsvLocation, indexcol  False printa print the dataframe just to see what Im getting.

Negative 6268 pId like to send notifications to my app users, even if they are offline, such as you have a new task, click here to evaluate. I COULD send an email, but besides that ancient solution, is it possible to send a visible notification to a google plus user, using its offline token or some other fancy techniquep  pFor instance, I can create a Moment, but it is stored at an obscure menu inside google plus called application log. No one will even notice a Moment there. If I could configure a Moment to appear in an alert box, that would solve the problem.p  pAt the other hand, a google app cannot write at the user stream without the user hitting a button. That makes even less sense, because the user will not push a button to notify himself... Besides, the notification is for the user, not for any of his circles. I dont need to publish at the stream but that would be better than nothing.p  pCurrently my environment is the web.p  pThis is probably a newbie question, but I could not find any answer around.p

Negative 6268 pI am working on a simple hangman program. I have most of the code working, but I am having trouble figuring out how to get the index of multiple matching chars in a char array. For example, I have a word sushi converted to a char array. If the user guesses an s then all s in the char array should be shown. The way that my code is, I actually have two char arrays of the same length. The first array holds the chars of the word to guess, while the second array holds question marks. My code should iterate through the first array and return the index of emeachem element in the array that matches the user guess. Then, the code inserts the user guess at each specified index and displays the second array for the user. Unfortunately, only the first occurrence is changed in the second array, so only the first index is returned from the match query. The problematic code is as followsp  precode            check if char array contains the user input             if guessThis.ContainsConvert.ToChartextBox1.Text                              save user input as char                 char userGuess  Convert.ToChartextBox1.Text                 iterate through first char array                 for int i  0 i lt guessThis.Length  1 i                                       check each element in the array                     probably dont need both for and foreach loops                     foreach char c in guessThis                                              get index of any element that contains the userinput                         var getIndex  Array.IndexOfguessThis, c                         check if the element matches the user guess                         if c  userGuess                                                      insert the userguess into the index                             displayAnswer[getIndex]  userGuess                                                                                  update the display label                 answerLabel.Text  new stringdisplayAnswer codepre  pSOLVED Working off of the example in the selected answer, I updated my code asp  precode                check if char array contains the user input             if guessThis.ContainsConvert.ToChartextBox1.Text                              save user input as char                 char userGuess  Convert.ToChartextBox1.Text                 string maybeThis  textBox1.Text                 string tryThis  new stringguessThis                 foreach Match m in Regex.MatchestryThis, maybeThis                                      displayAnswer[m.Index]  userGuess                                  answerLabel.Text  new stringdisplayAnswer              codepre

Negative 6268 pIve been using the new a hrefhttptools.android.comtechdocsnewbuildsystemuserguideapksplitsAPK splitsa feature of the 0.13 plugin for android and I managed to halve the size of my most of my build scripts and speed up builds by a factor of 4x. My app has a bit more than 20MB worth of libraries for each platform and keeping the APK size small is a priority. Before 0.13 we had a couple of scripts that dynamically staged .so files in right build folders depending on which platform we were building for and executed a full build. This worked fine but was terribly slow and involved an unfortunate mix of gradle and nongradle scripts.p  pThe latest APK splits feature solved most of my woes but Im still having a problem with armeabiv7a libraries. It seems that when gradle builds the armeabiv7a flavor, it only looks for libraries defined in the libsarmeabiv7a folder and ignores libraries were compiled for armeabi but not armeabiv7a.p  pFor example, this is one of my appsp  precodeApp1   libs    armeabi      lib1.so      lib2.so      lib3.so    armeabiv7a      lib3.so    x86      lib1.so      lib2.so      lib3.so codepre  pWhen I compile it for armeabiv7a then gradle includes armeabiv7alib3.so but not armeabilib1.so and armeabilib2.so.

Negative 6268 pI am using Simulink togheter with an Arduino Mega 2560 to control a motor with encoder. The encoder has 200 steps per revolution. My aim is to use external mode in order to get out data into the Simulink scope.p  pEarlier, when not using the Simulink blocks, this worked fine using codeattachInteruptcode. Now it does not work since Simulink does not have that option. I have tried two methodsp  ol liuse the digital input blocks and trigger  too slowli liuse the serial block togheter with an extra arduino uno that Only handles the encoder signal this extra arduino is not programmed in Simulink and sends the pulses to the main arduino the baudrate does not seem to the limiting factor, instead it is the fact that the block only handles uint8  also too slowli ol  pI cannot see the generated code in my Simulink license, and I would prefer a solution where blocks are used.

Is there a way to understand how many times a given line of code has been executed in prod and, which class is used at what frequency by real time production usage pattern for say a week  I mention prod as this instrumentation should not affect the already running code due to obvious sensitive reasons. We use maven for deployment. I heard, corbetura can come in handy for this use casebut,could not find how from their documentation.

For some reason it keeps returning the same value from the emfirstem file  and does not return the value from each individual file p  pFor example when I run this following command p  precodefor d in assetsclientcustom.css do  sed n 73p assetsstyle.css   cut c  2935  done codepre  pIf there are 20 directories it will bring back p  precode3a1504 3a1504 3a1504 3a1504 3a1504 3a1504 3a1504 codepre  p...20 times p  pWhat I am trying to get back is each individual value from the style.css from all the directories. p  pIs there anyone that can guide me on how I can get that accomplished and what I am doing wrongp
Negative 6268 pHeres what Im trying to do.  I have a list of tags inside a field.  Im trying to allow users to drill down search results using those tags.  Heres what the field looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6TaXO.png altfieldp  pSay a user wants to search for 10 fr, male, intermittent catheter.  I cant use like because some of the tags are similar ex male, female.  Is there a way to break it into an array and search as you would in php  Or something similarp  pIdeally, I would like to seperate each keyword and compare each tag against the list to make sure they are ALL in there.p  pThe closest Ive been able to come up with is something likep  precodeSelect d.fieldid115 as tags,tag.tagname, title.title, title.entryid, cattitle.catname FROM finntagger tag LEFT JOIN finntaggerlinks link                 ON tag.tagid  link.tagid                 LEFT JOIN finnchanneltitles title                 ON link.entryid  title.entryid                 LEFT JOIN finncategoryposts cat                 ON title.entryid  cat.entryid                 LEFT JOIN finncategories cattitle                 ON cat.catid  cattitle.catid                 Left JOIN finnchanneldata d                 ON cat.entryid  d.entryid                 WHERE cattitle.caturltitle  cathetersupplies                 AND tag.tagname male                 AND d.fieldid115 LIKE silicone codepre  pAlternatively, Each tag can also have its own field, but Im not sure how to make it check to ensure that if there are one or more tags, both tags are included.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwmtJk.png altpic2p  pSo I would need to make sure that the entryid has a record with each tag choice.  I tried to do that with the following  p  precodeSELECT  entryid                 FROM Select title.title, title.entryid, cattitle.catname FROM finntagger tag LEFT JOIN finntaggerlinks link                 ON tag.tagid  link.tagid                 LEFT JOIN finnchanneltitles title                 ON link.entryid  title.entryid                 LEFT JOIN finncategoryposts cat                 ON title.entryid  cat.entryid                 LEFT JOIN finncategories cattitle                 ON cat.catid  cattitle.catid                 Left JOIN finnchanneldata d                 ON cat.entryid  d.entryid                 WHERE tag.tagname IN silicone                 AND cattitle.caturltitle  cathetersupplies                 UNION ALL                 Select  title.title, title.entryid, cattitle.catname FROM finntagger tag LEFT JOIN finntaggerlinks link                 ON tag.tagid  link.tagid                 LEFT JOIN finnchanneltitles title                 ON link.entryid  title.entryid                 LEFT JOIN finncategoryposts cat                 ON title.entryid  cat.entryid                 LEFT JOIN finncategories cattitle                 ON cat.catid  cattitle.catid                 Left JOIN finnchanneldata d                 ON cat.entryid  d.entryid                 WHERE tag.tagname IN male                 AND cattitle.caturltitle  cathetersupplies as e                 group by entryid HAVING COUNT gt 1 codepre  pBut that just doesnt seem like the best way and its pretty slow.p

Negative 6268 pI have a Postgres table with several billion rows, and for a machine learning application need to divide it into train and test sets.p  pI want the test rows to be mostly contiguous by their codeidcode column, so would like to randomly select several chunks of 1,000 contiguous rows each and mark them as test rows.

Negative 6268 pFor a group project for school we have to make a program that implements the MVC pattern.p  pThe difficulty I have is understanding how the MVC pattern is implemente in java with SWING, does the view make the SWING componentsp  pAnother thing I have a hard time understanding is what updates what. For instance one article says the view executes the controller, then the controller updates the model accordingly, the model the notifies the view and and the view then pulls the data from the model. p  pWhile what ive learned about the MVC Pattern is that the controller has an instance of the model and the view so it can interact with both. but then if I push a button in the view how does the controller know to do something with the model And for this example which classes isare the Observers and which classes are the Observablesp  pAnother idea I had is that if we use the MVC Pattern as described above the view is the Observer and the model is the Observable, but that still leaves the question how does the controller know when to update the modelp  pIf it seems vague please ask for clarification in the comments and I will answer.p

Negative 6268 pIm trying to do something very basic retrieve a post value from a hidden field. The hidden field is obviously in my view file and I want to retrieve the value in my controller. Im using the framework SimpleMVCFramework.p  pI have a hidden field in my codeprojects.phpcode file the list with projects. When you click on a project, a method in the controller renders the clicked project and the corresponding page. This corresponding page is called codeproject.phpcodep  pThe hidden field in my codeprojects.phpcode viewp  precodeltform methodpost actionproject.phpgt      ltinput typehidden nameprojectid valueltphp echo project[id]gtgt ltformgt codepre  pThis hidden form is displayed correctly in my lists with projects.

So every project in codeprojects.phpcode has a hidden file that outputs correctly. When I try and click on a project, it brings me to codeproject.phpcode, but when I check out the codedatacode variable, the codeidcode is just empty.p  pThe routing works like a charm, because e.g. codedata[title]  Projectcode works great and is visible when I check the codedatacode variable. When I changep  precodedata[id]  POST[projectid] codepre  ptop  precodedata[id]  foobar codepre  pthe codeidcode in codeproject.phpcode isnt empty anymore, but shows codefoobarcode.

Negative 6268 pYesterday, I was surprised to come across some code that seemed to treat codechar[]code as being a typep  precodetypedef stduniqueptrltchar[]gt CharPtr codepre  pPreviously, I would have written something likep  precodetypedef stduniqueptrltchar, CharDeletergt CharPtr  Custom definition of CharDeleter omitted codepre  pAfter some research, I discovered that the codechar[]code syntax works because codestduniqueptrcode provides a template specialization to handle arrays e.g. it will automatically invoke codedelete[]code for the array without requiring a custom deleterp  pBut what does codechar[]code actually mean in Cp  pIve seen syntax likep  precodeconst char a[]  Constant string  Example 1  char p  new char[5]  Example 2  bool foochar param[10]  Example 3 codepre  pThis is how I interpret these examplesp  pExample 1 allocates a static array on the stack and the empty indices are valid because the true size of the string is known at compile time e.g. the compiler is basically handling the length for us behind the scenesp  pExample 2 dynamically allocates 5 contiguous characters with the first character being stored at the address stored in p.p  pExample 3 defines a function that takes an array of size 10 as a parameter. Behind the scenes the compiler treats the array like a pointer  e.g. it is an error to havep  precodevoid foochar test[5]  void foochar  test  codepre  pbecause the function signatures are ambiguous to the compiler.p  pI feel like i understand the arraypointer differences and similarities. My confusion likely stems from my lack of experience with buildingreading C templates.p  pI know that a template specialization basically allows a customized template based on a particular template to be used depending on the template type parameters.

ZERONEWTONFUN,DFUN,X0,TOL,NMAX tries to find the zero ZERO of the     continuous and differentiable function FUN nearest to X0 using the    Newton     method. FUN and its derivative DFUN accept real scalar input x and returns     a real scalar value. If the search fails an error message is displayed.    FUN and DFUN can also be inline objects.     [ZERO,RES,NITER] NEWTONFUN,... returns the value of the residual in ZERO    and the iteration number at which ZERO was computed.  x  x0  fx  fevalf,x,varargin  dfx  fevaldf,x,varargin niter  0  diff  tol1 resultVector  [x] while diff gt tol ampamp niter lt nmax dispx niter  niter  1 diff   dfxfx x  x  diff      diff  absdiff fx  fevalf,x,varargin         dfx  fevaldf,x,varargin resultVector  [resultVector x] end if niter gt nmax fprintf[newton stopped without converging to the desired tolerance,... because the maximum number of iterations was reachedn] end res  fx zero  x dispNumber of iterations is dispniter  plotresultVector return codepre  pI think I do not completely understand the part projecting all the original coordinates to coordinates in this subspace you can perform an m1dimensional NewtonRaphson procedure.

Negative 6268 pWe have a Java web project, say codewebappcode, with maven as its build facility, and it depends on some jars we develop. Lets say codejarAcode, codejarBcode. And They all have some parallel feature branches. For example codewebappBranch1code depends on codejarABranch1code and codejarBBranch1code, codewebappBranch2code depends on codejarABranch2code and codejarBBranch2code.p  pWe want to use codeJenkinscode as GUI build amp deploy interface, so here comes the problem We can not build amp deploy multiple feature branch at the same time. As each parallel branch didnt the change the artifactId, they will override former build of other feature branch. So parallel build will mess things up.p  pChanging artifactId of every feature branch seems impractical, because it will be a nightmare when merging feature branches of webapp together. p  pOne important thing to mention codejarAcode and codejarBcode are not codewebappcodes maven submodule.p  pWe considered some solutionsp  ol lipEach feature branch on an independent suite of jenkins  maven.pli lipOne suite jenkins  multiple maven local reposspecify maven local repos with codeDmaven.repo.localcode.pli ol  pSolution1 is the easiest one but require more resources.p  pSolution2 can solve the problem but not elegant, because we have to waste lots of disk space holding same copy of jars apachecommons, spring etc.p  pAny best practice solving the problem p

Negative 6268 pI have two JBoss EAP 6.1 instances S and T. At server T there is a JMS Queue Q. The requirement is to send a JMS message from S to Q. There is no need that the JMS session participate in the transaction.p  pMy first approach was to use JNDI lookup as from any ordinary clientp  precodeProperties p  new Properties p.setPropertyjava.naming.factory.initial, org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory p.setPropertyjava.naming.provider.url, remoteltIP server Tgt4447 p.setPropertyjava.naming.security.principal, user p.setPropertyjava.naming.security.credentials, pass InitialContext initialContext  new InitialContextp codepre  pThis works from a client app. However in an EJB in server S I get the exception codejavax.naming.NamingException JBAS011843 Failed instantiate InitialContextFactorycode.

However, because there is no need for container managed transactions, I am afraid of other complications like XA recovery problems. These problems would put the whole server at risk while the remote JNDI lookup fails only locally.p

Negative 6268 pI have an application that uses actionbarsherlock and google maps. I have 3 main tabs in the application and when you navigate two tabs away, the first tab is destroyed. I set the setOffscreenPageLimit to 2 but I would like to fix this issue correctly and sometimes when users get back to the map view the map is empty and nonresponsive. I keep the fragments in an array inside my actionbar activity to try to keep them from being destroyed which used to work with a previous version of google play but in moving to 7.0.0 I had to restructure my code.

Negative 6268 pI develop an application that relies heavily on AFNetworking to load data from a private API into Mantle models. My API client is a singleton subclass of codeAFHTTPSessionManagercode.p  pIm trying to implement a basic offline mode by leveraging codeNSURLCachecode. The approach is to modify the requests cache policy on codedataTaskWithRequestrequestcompletionHandlercode to codeNSURLRequestReturnCacheDataDontLoadcode if the codeAFNetworkReachabilityManagercode says the network is not reachable.p  pWhile I can verify that this actually works by using breakpoints during tests, the requests themselves are not being cached. I verified this by downloading the application container from Xcode, and checking the Cache.db sqlite file, which was empty. I also verified that I was looking at the correct cache by manually creating a dummy codeNSCachedURLResponsecode and forcefully storing it in the cache using codestoreCachedResponseforRequestcode. Then the dummy response did show up in the Cache.db sqlite file.p  pSo, I think I narrowed down the problem to my usual responses not being cached. I can also modify the headers sent by the server API. What I intend to do here is set a header codeCacheControl privatecode on the API responses so as not to make the other clients that use this API cache responses they shouldnt, and modify this cache header in the block of codesetDataTaskWillCacheResponseBlockcode, but this block never fires.p  pI understand that the URL system may decide when to call codeURLSessiondataTaskwillCacheResponsecompletionHandlercode, which calls the block, based on some undocumented rules, mainly the presence of a codeCacheControlcode header, and the response sizecache size ratio. But my response is a 145byte JSON, and the codeCacheControlcode header is set I verified both via codecurl vcode and inspecting the codetaskcode parameter of the codesuccesscode block of my request. p  pI also tried a more aggressive cache header, codeCacheControl public, maxage2592000code, to see if this caches the response or at least calls the block, but the behaviour was exactly the same. I also checked the codemyAFHTTPSessionManagerSubclass.session.delegatecode property, which was indeed pointing to codemyAFHTTPSessionManagerSubclasscode, as expected.p  pI also tried overriding codeURLSessiondataTaskwillCacheResponsecompletionHandlercode directly in my subclass, but it still was not called. Setting a breakpoint on this same delegate method on codeAFURLSessionManager.mcode in the codePodscode directory also does not work, the execution never stops on the breakpoint.p  pIm using version 2.5.4 of AFNetworking, according to my codePodfile.lockcode file.p  pstrongSo, how to make my responses cache preferably without setting agressive caching policies on the response, so I can implement a quick offline mode in my appstrongp  pemEDITem I also tried to create a codeNSURLSessioncode to see if this would work.

Negative 6268 pI have a rails project where Im making a couple of get requests through AJAX. When I run it locally, the request comes back to me and Im able to parse through the data and append it to my view page. However, when I pushed up to Heroku, it doesnt work and I get the following error p  precodeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property stops of null codepre  pThe line the error is referencing is from my first AJAX call. When I run locally it returns data back to me no errors at all when I have the console open and view it, so not sure why it wouldnt work once deployed. My guess would be that its assuming that the value for stops has finished which it seems to be locally, but on Heroku its using it before its returned. Im not sure why. Hoping that someone might have an idea as to why this is happening. p  pI do know that my view is recognizing my javascript page  threw an alert message just to make sure it was firing and it worked.

Negative 6268 pCan I know how to encode yuv420 video using JM such that each IDR frame must be associated with Buffering period SEI and picture timing SEI messages. I went through the encoder.cfg configure file but i coudnt find any options to enable buffering period SEI and picture timing SEI messages. Also when I went through the encoder code, I observed that nowhere they are updating the parameter strongseiBufferingPeriod.nalinitialcpbremovaldelaystrong present in buffering period SEI. I would like to know whether JM supports Buffering period and picture timing SEIs or not. If supports how to configure encoder and where they are updating the buffering period SEI parameters in the JM encoder.p

If the validation succeeds with codeDefaultcode, the groups codeClientcode and codeTypesOKcode are not called.p  pIf the validation fails however, these groups are called And error messages I would rather not have at this point are displayed along with the errors raised when validated with codeDefaultcode.p  pWhat I expected is that codeClientcode is never validated using codeDefaultcode, but that, instead, the codeDefaultcode group be converted to the group sequence code[Client, TypesOK]code, even if it goes through the codeValidcode constraint.p  pAm I missing somethingp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI made some progression about this. The validation problem I have only happens when I edit the form. When I edit the form, a Proxy class inheriting codeClientcode is used instead of the regular codeClientcode class.p  pA normal feature for Doctrine.p  pHowever, the validator metadata factory does not use the group sequence of the parent codeClientcode. It fetches its constraints, but not this property.p  pIt seems this problem is quite close to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30008760symfony2validateproxyentitythis other questiona however the resolution in there do not work for me.p  pThe problem seems pretty clear for me now, however I have no idea about how I should solve this properly.p
Negative 6268 pI am currently doing a programming project where I have declared 2 objects of a class called Statistician. The objects are called s1 and s2. Each object uses a function to read in 3 values of type double into the sequence. Then, for each sequence I compute and print results for length of sequence, last number entered, sum of sequence, arithmetic mean, smallest number, largest number each computation has its own function, which returns the value. p  pI am currently trying to overload the  operator so that I can add both sequences each with 3 numbers together, into a 3rd class object which will have all 6 values. Then, I hope to be able to perform the computations I listed above on this new class.

Negative 6268 pI have a complex image editor written for the browser to suit my game creating, and animation needs. I have developed it over a long time and now it is the only image editor I use as it is perfectly suited to my needs and style.p  pBUT I have one major problem. UNDO.p  pI have tried everything and can not find an effective solution. When considering the worst case, a 1920 by 1080 32 bit image that I have applied a dozen or more brush strokes that modify almost all the pixels I need to store quickly the whole image for every stroke. I will also have several images of differing sizes that I switch between layering, composting p  pI have tried downloading the undos, but that is too slow and the download bar is annoying. I have tried the Chrome file API but that quickly slows the whole app down and as I hear it is being dropped, and I would like to keep the app supporting all the standard browsers. I have tried sending the undos of to webworkers just to store them away from the apps memory allocation, but I am heavily reliant on these and end up with only a few undos.p  pI have looked for an undo API but so far nothing. I have looked for Javascript framework solution but none seem to deal with raw pixel data and rely on recording brush strokes. Much of the painting is direct pixel manipulation and can not be reversed this way.p  pI really hope someone has a solution or if someone knows of something in the pipe line that will solve my undo problem. Or even a browser hack that will give me more memory. I live with ONE undo and am so over having to start a drawing again.p

Negative 6268 pI need to implement CORS filter in a Play application and searching the internet I saw that there are two approaches 1. Configuring CORS filters in the application.conf file and creating a Filters.class  2. Creating a Global.class that ads the headers to the request as well as having a preflight method in my main Controller.p  pWhat I could not find is advantages of one offer the other and when should I use one method and when the other. Any insights on thisp

Negative 6268 pI am working on legacy javaj2ee project which is using ServletsJSPJDBC, it has been evolving since long hence there is no framework involved. However we have followed command pattern for servlets and done same basic application of OOPs concepts. We dont have Service layer nor the DAO layer . Below is the basic design of application.p  pAll servlets extend a base servlet , This base Servlet holds the DB connection variable  which is a instance variable . All the BeansVOs hold the code for getting data from DB too along with Setter and getter code . Each Bean has connection variable  instance variablep  pEach time a servlet gets invoked it calls the Super servlet to get connection object  the servlet get the connection object using DButil class using Datasource  and when servlet wants to get any data from DB it calls the respective Bean and sets the connection object and the bean performs all the DB operation using plain old JDBC code once the Bean is done with fetching of data and control goes back to servlet the servlet closes the connection before forwarding to JSP.p  pNow I want to improve the design , I know i can bring in serviceDAO layer but this is time consuming as the application has about 300400  Beans  we also have 300 tables this would take atleast 34 months with 510 resources .p  pSuper Servlet , this is extended by all Servlets.p  precodeimport java.sql.Connection import java.util.MissingResourceException import java.util.ResourceBundle  import javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher import

Negative 6268 pI am looking to make a demo to prove that this concept works. The demo will have a stick and knife where you can cut and shape the stick, making it pointyshorteretc.p  pSo Im wondering how to go about this. I know that my blade would have to be a trigger collider and I have to calculate how deep it would cut into the surface of the stick. The tricky part is when I want to segment the mesh of the stick. I could add in some mesh Boolean operators. so once the knife enters the stick it subtracts the knifes mesh from the stick, I dont like this idea because it is expensive and the stick losses mass because it is subtracted other than cut.p  pAnother Idea would be to give the stick some code that will try and patch its surface. so I would add a plane to the knife with some attributes so the patch code sees it as a blade, and splits the surface. This would be a pain because I have to write an algorithm that can find the triangles and detect cuts. So this way it creates a new surface instead of stealing the knifes surface and inverting the triangles of it to add to the stick.p  pThese are expensive operation either way, I will have to push as much code into a Compute Shader to help with speed.p  pIf you guys have any idea for the best way to do this or other ways that I have not thought of please let me know. I also dont want to have to use any asset store plugins.p

Negative 6268 pI am attempting to build a dataset from unstructured data.  The raw data is a series of json files each of which contains information about a single element of the data eg. each file becomes a row in the final data.  I am looping through the jsons using jsonlite to turn each into a huge nested list.  This whole operation is falling apart on the basis of a seemingly simple problem  p  pI need to append rows to my data where some of the elements do not exist.p  pThe raw data is like sop  precodejsn1 lt listidid1, col11, col2A, col311 jsn2 lt listidid2, col12, col2B, col312 jsn3 lt listidid3, col2C, col313 jsn4 lt listidid4, col13, col314 codepre  pThe structure I am trying to get to is thisp  precodedf lt data.frameidcid1,id2,id3,id4,                  col1c1,2,NA,4,                  col2cA,B,C,NA,                  col3c11,12,13,14  gt df    id col1 col2 col3 1 id1    1    A   11 2 id2    2    B   12 3 id3   NA    C   13 4 id4    4 ltNAgt   14 codepre  pMy approach is along the lines ofp  precodeCollect the json names in a vector filescjsn1,jsn2,jsn3,jsn4  Initialize the dataframe with the first row filling in any missing values.   I didnt do this at first, but it seems helpful. df1data.frameidjsn1id,      col1jsn1col1,      col2jsn1col2,      col3jsn1col3,      stringsAsFactorsF  Create a loop to loop through the files extracting the values then add them to a dataframe. for i in 2lengthfiles      a lt getfiles[i]     new.row lt listidaid,               col1acol1,               col2acol2,               col3acol3      df1 lt rbinddf1,b  codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work because codedf1 lt rbinddf1,new.rowcode requires the columns to be the same length.

And read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22045681addingrowtoadataframewithmissingvaluesthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23156819raddacolumnwithmissingvaluestoadataframethisa among others.p  pMost answers can add to the data frame by knowing a priori what columns will be null not null.  Then constructing a df without those columns and adding it with fill.  This wont work as I have no idea what columns will be present ahead of time.  The missing ones currently end up with 0 elements which is the root of the problem, but I need to check if they are present.  It seems like there should be an easy way to handle this either on read or on the rbind, but I cant seem to figure it out.p  pThere are potentially hundreds of columns and millions of rows though 10s and 100s right now.  The jsons are large so reading them all into memory  contacting the lists somehow is probably not possible with the real data. A solution using data.table would probably be ideal.  But any help is appreciated.  Thanks.p
