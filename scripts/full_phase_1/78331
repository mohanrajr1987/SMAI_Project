Positive 78331 pIm using PhoneGap and JQueryMobile to create a mobile app that I want to deploy to both iOS and Android. The app is simple, and just consists of 3 bars A headersearch bar, a second bar displays the results of the search, and the remaining screen is a  that the user can write in.p  pBecause I want to code my layout to look the same for the greatest  of devices, Ive written my CSS for the layout of the app in s. Header is 6, Second bar is 14, ect. This appears to work decently for the devices Ive tested for so far. I ran into an issue where the Android keyboard would squish the viewport height and therefore my layout. So I set the keyboard to resizePan and that solved the squishing issue. However now the bottom of the  is not visible until the user closes the keyboard.p  pIn the questions Ive seen about that issue, the solution is to swap to adjustResize so that the user can scroll when the keyboard is active. I cant do this, because I want to avoid the layoutsquish issue.p  pIs there a way to fix this without having to rewrite the CSS If I HAVE to rewrite the CSS, how should I code the layout to look consistent on multiple devices Do I have to use an extensive list of media queries for all possible devicesp  pNote This isnt an issue for ios, because the softinput keyobard overlays the textarea like adjustPan but still allows the user to scroll down and up to parts of the document outside of the view or covered by the keyboard.p

On our development server and build this seemed to be working, but in our production app on the App Store no push notifications seem to be received.

The only difference between dev and production here should be the certificatesprofiles, and I believe those are configured correctly.p  pIs there any other way to troubleshoot an issue like this Is there any way through Apples developer tools to confirm that device tokens are valid other than trying to send to them, which it is trying to, or to send test messages other than directly through our backend Im not sure how to troubleshoot this since Im not actually seeing any errors.

Negative 78331 pI was discussing with a coworker the other day the similarities of implementing a Software Factory for your development organization vs. using more of a scaffolding solution like active record. We both thought that implementing a Software factory may be considered by some to be a good idea when you have a larger group of developers and you want to maintain a certain level of consistency and convention within your code base. p  pThinking about it a little more, I realized that I really like the idea of Software Factories for personal use, because they make it easier for me to code up the projects that I work on for fun as they save me a lot of headache in writing boilerplate code.  That being said, I would bet that enforcing the use of a Software Factory in larger organizations might cause some strife within the team because some developers may think that it would be an infringement on their ability to be creativep  pSo what Im wondering from those of you who have been part of an organization that has implemented factories is what strongemcriteriaemstrong would it take to dictate the use of a factory within an organization, when the risk may be a bunch of unhappy developersp

I need this hot key to be active when any Widget within the TabFolder is active however, it shouldnt be active if the selection is in a different tab folder or widget outside of a tab folder.p  pIn an attempt to solve this, I wrote a simple recursive function to apply the key listener to all of the children of the tab folderp  precodepublic void applyQuickSwitchKeyBindings      removeKeyListenerka     addKeyListenerka     forControl c getChildren         applyQuickSwitchKeyBindingsToChildrenc        private void applyQuickSwitchKeyBindingsToChildrenControl c       ifcnull return     ifc instanceof Composite          Control[] controls  Compositec.getChildren         forControl c2 controls             applyQuickSwitchKeyBindingsToChildrenc2         ifcontrols.length lt 1              c.removeKeyListenerka             c.addKeyListenerka                codepre  pThen i call the applyQuickSwitchKeyBindings after I add the controls to each TabItem in the tab group. p  pThe good news was that the quick switch hot key ALT   worked greatp  pThe bad news was that the original TAB ordering based on zindex is now gone. When you hit the SWT.TAB key you lose focus on your current text box and dont gain focus on anything else...p  pQuestionsp  p1. Can each control only have one KeyListenerp  p2. Why is the original TAB traversal not working anymorep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 78331 pOne of the characteristics I love most about Googles Task Queue is its simplicity. More specifically, I love that it takes a URL and some parameters and then posts to that URL when the task queue is ready to execute the task.p  pThis structure means that the tasks are always executing the most current version of the code.  Conversely, my gearman workers all run code within my django project  so when I push a new version live, I have to kill off the old worker and run a new one so that it uses the current version of the code.p  pMy goal is to have the task queue be independent from the code base so that I can push a new live version without restarting any workers. So, I got to thinking why not make tasks executable by url just like the google app engine task queuep  pThe process would work like thisp  ol liUser request comes in and triggers a few tasks that shouldnt be blocking.li liEach task has a unique URL, so I enqueue a gearman task to POST to the specified URL.li liThe gearman server finds a worker, passes the url and post data to a workerli liThe worker simply posts to the url with the data, thus executing the task.li ol  pAssume the followingp  ol liEach request from a gearman worker is signed somehow so that we know its coming from a gearman server and not a malicious request.li liTasks are limited to run in less than 10 seconds There would be no long tasks that could timeoutli ol  pstrongWhat are the potential pitfalls of such an approachstrong Heres one that worries mep  ul liThe server can potentially get hammered with many requests all at once that are triggered by a previous request. So one user request might entail 10 concurrent http requests. I suppose I could have a single worker with a sleep before every request to ratelimit.li ul  pAny thoughtsp

But in that case i cant run my game on a dual quadcore server, because it would only use 1 CPU for the hardest tasks.p  pAnyone know what to do herep  pstrongSpecification in reaction to Deltremestrongp  pYou are absolutly right, and your method will work in most cases. BUT, The threads have to update the location of the spaceobject in the Space class.p  pLets say i have 2 SpaceObjects next to eachother, they are moving towards eachother. 1 Object is in thread A, the other is in thread B. Once i update the objects the threads have to write to the Space together to write the new values in the Tile an individual part of Space. That individual call cannot be done in different threads at once, cause the Space object would burst...p  pWhat could happen is a collision, and i could write an Event that occurs if their are 2 ships  1 tile. Thats not the problem.p  pIm thinking that in the case of 10000 ships, the CPU would primarily be switching between threads and not running them all togheter. So in the interest of performance, i want to be able to to everything simultaniouslyp

Negative 78331 pIm not real hip on exactly what roles todays proxy servers can play and Im learning so go easy on me   I have a clientserver system I have written using a homegrown protocol and need to enhance the client side to negotiate its way out of a proxy environment.p  pI have an existing client and server system written in C and C for the speed and a small amount of MFC in the client to handle the user interface.  I have written both the server and client side of the system on Windows the people I work for are mainly web developers using Windows everything  not a choice sticking to Berkeley Sockets as it were via wsock32 for efficiency.  The clients connect to the server through a nonstandard port even though using port 80 is an option to get out of some environments but the protocol that goes over it isnt HTTP.  The TCP connections stay open for the duration of the clients participation in real time conferences.p  pOur customer base is expanding to all kinds of networked environments.  I have been able to solve a lot of problems by adding the ability to connect securely over port 443 and using secure sockets which allows the protocol to pass through a lot environments since the internal packets cant be sniffed.  But more and more of our customers are behind a proxy server environment and my direct connections dont make it through.  My old school understanding of proxy servers is that they act as a proxy for external HTML content over HTTP, possibly locally caching popular material for faster local access, and also allowing their IT staff to blacklist certain destination sites.  Customer are complaining that my software doesnt recognize and easily navigate its way through their proxy environments but Im finding it difficult to decide what my best fit solution should be.  My software doesnt tear down the connection after each client request, and on top of that packets can come from either side at any time, basically your typical custom clientserver system for a specific niche.p  pMy first reaction is why cant they just add my servers addresses to their white list but if there is a programmatic way I can get through without requiring their IT staff to help it is politically better and arguably a better solution anyway.  Plus maybe Im still not understanding the role and purpose of what proxy servers and environments have grown to be these days.p  pMy first attempt at a solution was to use WinInet with its various proxy capabilities to establish a connection over port 80 to my nonstandard protocol server which knows enough to recognize and answer a simple HTTPlooking GET request and answer it with a simple HTTP response page to get around some environments that employ initial packet sniffing DPI.  I retrieved the actual SOCKET handle behind WinInets HINTERNET request object and had hoped to use that in place of my softwares existing SOCKET connection and hopefully not need to change much more on the client side.  It initially seemed to be my solution but on further inspection it seems that the OS gets firstchance at the received data on this socket since when I get notified of events via the standard select... statement on the socket and query the size of the data available via ioctlsocket the call succeeds but returns 0 bytes available, the reads dont work and it goes downhill from there.p  pCan someone tell me of a clientside library commercial is fine will let me get past these proxy server environments with as little user and IT staff help as possible  From what I read it has grown past SOCKS and I figure someone has to have solved this problem before me.p  pThanks for reading my longwinded question,p  pRipredp

Negative 78331 pIm using Eclipse Galileo, with a plugin for PHP development.  I use the same editor at work and at home for my personal projects at work, I do not use PHP or the PHP plugin, however.p  pOne thing about using it is driving me crazy, though, and though Ive spent a couple of hours digging through all the different options under WindowPreferences as well as searching around the Internet, I cant find out how to do this one thing.  Maybe someone here can help mep  pHeres whats happening.  Ive got a line of codep  precodeltphp     echo Hello world   lt Im talking about this line gt codepre  pand my cursor is on the w in world.p  pI hit the Home key on my keyboard.  In my key mappings, it claims this is supposed to take me to the beginning of the line Line Start, to be exact.  To me, start means there is nothing to the left of this position, aka position 1.  As in, no tabs, no spaces, no nothing, and if I hit the Left arrow key on my keyboard, I should then move to the end of the previous line.  You know, how your browser works inside of a textarea, and how Word, Notepad, Excel, and almost every other program works.  p  pInstead, when I hit Home, my cursor moves to position 5, the very beginning of the word echo.  This, in case its not clear, is NOT the start of the line.  Its the start of the nonwhitespace content on the line, but thats not the way I expect this key to function.  If I hit Home again, I get to the REAL start of the line  position 1.  Hit it again, and Im back to 5.  p  pIts possible that its not a matter of the Home key at all, but potentially a sideeffect of the Smart Indenting function.  I also cant figure out how to turn that off Ive seen a few posts here that indicate that it cant be done, and it frequently messes up my formatting which causes me to waste my time fixing it, as Im particular about how my code looks when Im coding. For example, when I copypaste a line, the indenting gets all messed up the pasted line tabs in to where Eclipse thinks it should be, in spite of all of the preceding whitespace Ive copied along with the text on the line.  This may be related to the operation of the Home key, or to Eclipses conception of what the start of the line really means.p  pI realize that people out there who dont code like I do will have an initial reaction of change the way you type, or ignore the messedup formatting and let Eclipse autofix it later or something similar.  Thats possible, but will take quite a bit of time, and is actively hindered by the fact that Id be changing the way I work on this one app in this one setting, as it doesnt do this at work, while all the others will continue to operate as I expect them to.  So for me, that sort of suggestion is not a very viable option.p  pThanks in advance for any help, advice or assistance you can offer.p  pPS.

Next it goes to each of those internal pages and repeats the above process.p  pBasically its job is to crawl all the pages under a specified domain and grab each pages source. Now the reason for this is, I want to run some checks to see if this or that keyword is found on any of the pages as well as to list each pages meta information.p  pI would like to know if I should run these checks on the html during the crawling phase of each page or if I should save all the html in an array for example and run the checks all the way at the end.

Negative 78331 pI have the great joy of being forced to import data from an old system into our new system.  The old system uses MySQL and the new one is using MS SQL Server.

Negative 78331 pIm developing a WPF application. In this application, I have a Window which contains a WrapPanel. Inside the WrapPanel are a series of StackPanels which have varying heights, but all the same width. The number and size of the StackPanels is not known at design time they are generated dynamically.p  pThese StackPanels normally stack fine on top of each other, and then wrap to another column when there is no more room in the WrapPanel. To achieve this, I had to set a fixed height for my WrapPanel with the height set to Auto, it would continue down the page instead of wrapping to another column. However, when by chance I have a StackPanel that is too large to fit in the WrapPanel height, it is simply truncated. An image of this situation is below.

This is what the code looks like EDIT made what should be a self contained examplep  precodeobj        init function         var c         dojo.connectdojo.doc, mousedown, this, functionevt             this.downevt             ifevt.button  dojo.mouseButtons.RIGHT                 this.isDown  true                 c  dojo.connectdojo.doc, mousemove, this, drag                               dojo.connectdojo.doc, mouseup, this, functionevt             dojo.disconnectc              this.isDown  false             this.upevt              ,end init      drag functionevt         console.logMouse drag,evt     ,      up functionevt         console.logMouse up,evt     ,      down functionevt         console.logMouse down,evt      end obj codepre  pEDIT to try this out, inject dojo on any page with an img with the console and then create this obj and run obj.init.  Inject with 1.5p  precodedocument.documentElement.firstChild     .appendChilddocument.createElementscript     .srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsdojo1.5dojodojo.xd.js codepre  pIt looks symmetric to me and works fine if I click over most of the document.  However if I click on an icon and drag it, the drag function is called only once the connection should have made it so every movement of the cursor called it, and the mouseup event isnt called when I release the mouse.p  pThen next time I mousedown it overwrites c with a new connection, making it so I cant ever disconnect the previous one and thus what I intended to only be active for dragging becomes a permanent event.p  pA bad solution Ive implemented is disconnecting before connecting in the mousedown connection.  That makes sure I dont get permanent calls to drag but still leaves me with rogue calls to drag until I click again to unset it.p  pAny tips to why this is happeningp
Negative 78331 pI have a program that sends POJO from a server to a client. For primitive data types like codeString[]code or codeBooleancode it works fine.

Any ideasp  pstrongEDIT 2strong  Updatep  psorry  made a copypaste mistake with code in the original question   cant seem to edit it so Ill put a correct version below  so to clarifyp  pcodeMainViewControllercode  has a codeUIViewcode codecontainerViewcode which doesnt take up the whole screen, and codeCustomViewcode  is a codeUIViewcode with a XIB file  it is the codeUIViewcode here that when it is rendered with codeAspectFitcode is rendering outside the bounds of the parent codecontainerViewcodep  pWith the code below does this make sense now  The reason for this code is I have a custom codeUIViewcode, BUT I have a XIB file associated with it, so this was the only way to get my codeMainControllercode view to be able to use it.  That is, have a container view in the codeMainControllercode codeviewcode, and then programmatically add the codeCustomViewcode into the container view.p  pRe So set the frame or center of the view that youre adding to be what you want it to be  are you saying I have to programmaticallymanually set the dimension of the CustomView to be what I want in relation to the parent containerView  p  pWhat I was hoping was there was a way using the declaritive layout setting to some how be able to say Load the Custom View from its XIB file, and the aspectFit this view into the self.containerView, however Im starting to wonder if this is possiblep  pUPDATED CODE BELOW made mistake in original question when I copypasted it in and changed variables names etcp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Load the custom Altimeter View into this UIControllerViews container UIView for it     NSArray nibs  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedCustomview ownerself optionsnil]     for NSObject obj in nibs          if  [obj isKindOfClass[Customview class]]              Customview cv  Customviewobj             [self.containerView addSubviewcv]             break                    UI Layout     self.containerView.layer.borderWidth  2     self.containerView.layer.borderColor  [[UIColor redColor] CGColor]  codepre

Negative 78331 pI kept looking for answer but didnt find one. I have a virtual env dir, a project dir with a req.txt. When I run pip r req.txt, it installs some apps from github source and some from pypi. The ones from pypi are fine after relocatable call on the virtual evn, however the links in the sitepackages for the apps that it installed from github still point to the old directory location.p  pAnyone else has seen this behavior Any quick way around it Also, relocatable is not honoring the nositepackages flag that was used on the virtualenv originally.

Negative 78331 pRecently, I started using the System.Net.Sockets class introduced in the Mango release of WP7 and have generally been enjoying it, but have noticed a disparity in the latency of transmitting data in debug mode vs. running normally on the phone.p  pI am writing a remote control app which transmits a single byte to a local server on my LAN via Wifi as the user taps a button in the app. Ergo, the perceived responsivenesstimeliness of the app is highly important for a good user experience.p  pWith the phone connected to my PC via USB cable and running the app in debug mode, the TCP connection seems to transmit packets as quickly as the user taps buttons.p  pWith the phone disconnected from the PC, the user can tap up to 7 buttons and thus case 7 send commands with 1 byte payloads before all 7 bytes are sent. If the user taps a button and waits a little between taps, there seems to be a latency of 1 second.p  pIve tried strongsetting Socket.NoDelay to both True and False, and it seems to make no difference.strongp  pTo see what was going on, I used a packet sniffer to see what the traffic looked like. p  ul lipWhen the phone was connected via USB to the PC which was using a Wifi connection, each individual byte was in its own packet being spaced 200ms apart. pli lipWhen the phone was operating on its own Wifi connection disconnected from USB, the bytes still had their own packets, but they were all grouped together in bursts of 4 or 5 packets and each group was 1000ms apart from the next.pli ul  pbtw, Ping times on my Wifi network to the server are a low 2ms as measured from my laptop.p  pI realize that buffering sends together probably allows the phone to save energy, but strongis there any way to disable this delaystrong The responsiveness of the app is more important than saving power.p

Negative 78331 pI was having trouble with the standard Windows Forms TreeView specifically with the colour with which the default control used to render the selected node when the treeview did not have focus.

This is working well, but now HotTracking active highlighting when the mouse is over a given tree node is being over ridden by my custom codeOnDrawNodecode event.

The only way the data is transmitted is though the formatted text.p  pAnyone know otherwise or can offer helpful advisep

Negative 78331 pI have a Perl script that is calling a program on Windows using backticks. It works fine when I run it in the command prompt. It stops working when I run it using Windows task scheduler. This is on Windows Server 2008 x64 with ActiveState Perl. It gives me an error  is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. Once I change my call to the program to point to the full path of the program it works again.p  pSo something about when its run in a task schedule with backticks prevents it from seeing the windows environmental variables, specifically the PATH variable when its run. Something is maybe missing from the shell thats spawned by the backticks Should I be using a different command to perform the system calls Or is there a task scheduler setting that will solve this If anyone can assist I would appreciate it.p  pTo be honest my environment is more complicated than this, but this is what Ive narrowed it down to. I actually have a task schedule with a batch file that runs a php script which itself runs the perl script which then runs the program.

Negative 78331 pI have a project where SGEN is used to precompile the serialization assemblies without the proxytypes flag.

Negative 78331 pI am trying to implement read aloud feature in Monocle using javascript. I am getting started in java script so please excuse my questions here.

Negative 78331 pI am having some slowness with some image filtering Im trying to do.  I can fix the problem Im having by simply caching the changes I make.  However, Id like to optimise this as much as I can without caching first, before I implement that.

As I said, caching will fix this, but I want to optimise other ways first.p  pThese are the two ideas Ive hadp  p1.Reduce copying of imagep  pI already have the image I want to modify, stored in an image, as a part of it.  In other words, I have a sprite sheet loaded into memory, and so there is a portion of the image I want to modify for a new draw.

But I cant find any way to draw my modified pixel data to a canvas through drawImage and avoiding putImageData altogether.  Is there a wayp  pThanksp

It seems like I cant add typehinting to a specific class variable.  The workaround for now has been to set up a temporary variable called bar, set the type hinting on it, then use it to get the methods Im looking for and copying them back into the right context.p  pIm curious if Im just trying something wrong, doing something unsupported, misunderstanding how I should be declaring the javadoc, or have a fundamental misunderstanding of how this typehinting should be working.p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 78331 pWhat constitutes a legal digital signature for a emweb formem not a documentp  pstrongOPTION 1strong I worked on a project where a doctor makes notes on the health of a patient. When the web form is submitted a PDF is generated and digitally signed with a digital .CER certificate and the PDF is saved to the file system. Each doctor had their own .CER file and password which was a real PITA to maintain and the overhead of generating, storing, and backing up PDFs is quite high.p  pThere are also thirdparty solutions like CoSign which allow the user to authenticate to CoSign as the form submits and, if properly authenticated, somehow digitally signs that form. I believe all of these solutions require an export to various types of documents and then storage of the document and require the end signer to have an account with CoSign. That isnt going to work...p  pAll of these signatures require the data to be stored in a document which is not ideal for many projects.p  pstrongOPTION 2strong I went to the Microsoft store at the Mall of America and purchased a new Surface to be later returned   and when checking out they gave me a tablet ironically it wasnt a Surface and a pen and I jotted down my signature. Another example is the Square app which also requires the user to jot down their signature on a touchscreen of some sort. I would assume the signature is stored as an image somewhere in a database but does that constitute a legal documentp  pIve worked at a small medical device company which had their doctors evaluate tests on the web and digitally sign their evaluation, but all that did was upload an image of their signature saved in the database.p  pstrongOPTION 3strong Yet another way Ive seen this done is when filling out my FAFSA for college tuition aid back in the day. Theyd ask you to review the terms, yada yada, and then at the bottom I had to type in my full legal name as it appears above and the submit the form. strongWhat are they doing behind the curtainsstrongp  pThe project Im working on is a simple onepage contract for a construction company which explains all of the services to be rendered and requires a signature and date. The electronic version of this form would collect all of the required data in a web form and save it to a data store.p  pMy initial reaction was to provide a ltcanvasgt based HTML5 element that can be signed on an iPad or something. Does the data need to be exported to a document and then signed using a digital signature or can the data be legal and signed in the data storep

Negative 78331 pIm writing some jQuery code that hides or displays numerous table columns from a large table at the same time.  I wanted to know if it would be faster to use code like thisp  precodeselector 1, selector 2, selector 3.cssdisplay, none codepre  por code like thisp  precodeselector 1.cssdisplay, none selector 2.cssdisplay, none selector 3.cssdisplay, none codepre  pSo I used a hrefhttpjsperf.commultipleselectorsvsmultiplestatemtents relnofollowjsperf.com to create a performance test casea.  With that I established that the first type of code which uses one long string with multiple selectors is faster than the second type of code which hides columns one at a time by about 53.  However, by the time Im done writing it, it will be borderline unreadable, looking something like thisp  precodetable tr nthchild4, table tr nthchild5, table tr nthchild6, table tr nthchild7, table tr nthchild8, table tr nthchild9, table tr nthchild10, table tr nthchild11, table tr nthchild12.cssdisplay, none codepre  pSo my question is, which is the greater evil for jQueryJS codeinefficient performance, or lack of readability  My background is in Python so I tend to value readability above performance, and 53 doesnt seem like a huge dropoff in real world terms.  But on the other hand, I plan to minify my JS code once I deploy it, so it will end up not being readable anyway...though I know there are deminifiers out there that can return my code to its original readable or unreadable form.  As you can see I can talk myself around in circles on this topic, and Im not looking to start a debate or discussion, so Im just posting this here in case theres a generally accepted way of handling this in the jQueryJS community.p

Negative 78331 pI need help with MySQL query. Basically to simplify itp  pI have a table with meteorological data from a weatherstation. One of the measured parameters is rainfall. I have managed to get the calculations to a form where I have one column with days 1 Feb, 2 Feb, 3 Feb etc. and second column, which gives the daily rainfall for that particular day 0, 3.5, 14.2 etc.. p  pNow what I want to do next is calculate the longest dry and longest wet period. In other words, the longest period where there is 0 rainfall on consecutive days, wetperiod being the exact opposite  most consecutive nonzero days. p  pIn the output I want to have  the number of days in the period, starting date and end date. So basically two variables, lets say drycount, drydate, which I would then transform into an output such as Number of days drycount, drydate. p  pI initially had it as two variables drystart and dryend, but that didnt work, because in case there are two occassions for example where there is the same longest period, I would then want it as eg. 3 Feb  5 Feb, 8 Mar  11 Mar  so the date needs to be in the end saved as one variable and if it is not null, then it would add a comma and the other period.p  pI tried various things but wasnt successful. The data is extracted on a PHP site from a MySQL database, so I am getting the results in a while statment, row after row. Any help please I hope I explained it ok.p

Negative 78331 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have taken over the development of a Magento Enterprise website which has a custom theme. When the custom theme was created the base default templates were used rather than the enterprise default templates and so therefore the theme doesnt have any of the enterprise functionality.p  pIve setup a vanilla Magento Enterprise install which matches the version number used on this site 1.11.1.0 and Im slowly working through diffing the two sites and adding the functionality back in one module at a time. p  pHowever Ive run into a hurdle with how the banner functionality works and therefore I am having problems trying to debug what is missing from the custom theme for them to work correctly.p  pstrongWhat I do knowstrongp  pThe functionality works fine on my vanilla Enterprise site.p  pTheres no XML layout files for the banner module, which makes sense as they are created dynamically within the admin section which allows you to select which pageblock you want to insert the banner widgets into.p  pUsing commerce bug and looking at the compiled page layout XML the banner XML nodes are definitely being inserted so are not being created programatically via PHP within other templates or blocks.p  pIve looked right through the banner module and in the observersevents but cant see anything that is of any relevance as to how the nodes are being inserted.p  pIt does seem to be coupled with the Enterprise CMS module.p  pIve found references to the Banners in the FPC module, but FPC is not in use on this site and those methods are not hit when FPC is disabled.p  pIve double checked and the module output is not disabled within Admin Advanced.p  pIm using the DesignFallbacks module with enterprisedefault and that hasnt helped either.p  pIve setup some banners in the exact same way on the custom site as in the vanilla enterprise site however the compiled XML does not have the banner nodes being inserted.p  pIve searched across Google and Stack Overflow but information on Enterprise Banners is very limited and what I could find only talks about the admin section and not how they function from the code level.p  pAll this now leads to...p  pstrongWhat Id like to knowstrongp  pHowwhere the banner XML nodes make their way into the layout XML.p

Unfortunately, on the iPhone, the dialog is too small, and it does not stay centered on the screen if the user has previously zoomed in. p  pHeres the codep  precode...     .dialog         autoOpen false,         title Disclaimer,         resizable false,         width 500,         modal true,         position top10,         buttons                              Accept function         this .dialog close        window.location.hrefmailtoinfoexample.com       ,     Cancel function         this .dialog close        .emailaddress.clickfunctionevent  event.preventDefault     dialog.dialogopen     .uidialog button.blur   codepre  pIm trying to figure out the best way to address this issue. Ideally, Id like the dialog to fill up most of the screen and always be centered even if the user is zoomed in i.e., I dont want the dialog to ever be cut off when displayed. Alternatively, Id like the dialog to behave as a native dialog box on the iPhone. If I do the latter, will it be necessary to create a separate script that will only run when viewed on a smart phone  p  pAny thoughts on the best way to accomplish either of these goals would be much appreciated.p

Negative 78331 pI am wondering whether there is a way in Mac OS X to receive a notification when the frontmost window switches to a different window  either an ObjectiveC solution, or Python, or AppleScript, or something else. I want to look at the whole system, not just within my application. My app is trying to keep track of what file the user is currently working on, and I have a polling solution that gets the frontmost app and frontmost window every so often by running an AppleScript, but it would simplify my life if I could run that check only when I knew that the frontmost window had changed.p  pIve also looked at NSDistributedNotificationCenter and global event monitors for NSEvents, which are both useful in different ways, but dont seem able to give me the specific frontwindowchange notification that Im ideally looking for. p  pAny ideas on directions I should try, or whether this is even possible, would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 78331 pIve just found that if one uses the blocklayered module, the current page param p, from FrontController is not updated globally when you change page. That means that the relative smarty var is available only in some really small areas such as ul.pagination in pagination.tpl. Thats probably due to the ajax nature of the module.p  pAnd thats awful. I need pagination data outside that small chunks and in every point of all the category tpl components. It should in fact be like this, since there a p var in the FrontController that doesnt get updated and also you cannot read in GET or POST, and obviously it should. At least it should be posted, or there should be some kind of hook to read it onchange.p  pIs there any way to achieve thisp  pThank you p

Negative 78331 pIm looking into creating a website that allows people to create their own designs for a certain product.  This product can have straight lines, curves, squares, and various shapes.

For instance p  precodeclass CollectionsController lt ApplicationController   beforefilter authenticateuser, except [index, show]    def index     collections  Collection.all      if currentuser       render admin     else       render index     end   end end codepre  pIn which case codeadmincode and codeindexcode correspond to codeviewscollectionsadmin.html.hamlcode and codeviewscollectionsindex.html.hamlcode respectively.

Negative 78331 pI have many points 100,000 in 3 dimensional space. I need to use nearest neighbor and range queries. Firstly I used kdtree k3 but each point has a velocity attribute.

But I have to calculate their new locations according to the their velocity. I have to find nearest neighbor and search in range after calculate their new location.p  pEverytime the points change their locations I must update kdtree but it is costly. It slows me down.

That is, the contact form would show a success message, but the message would never arrive.p  pAfter a long back and forth with my hosting service, I found out that in order to avoid spoofing they wont allow emails to be sent where the FROM address they dont host.

I also use it to perform complex fetch requests in the background and then pass the object IDs to the main queue to fetch the objects using these IDs.p  pThis works quite well. However, I am not sure how to let the main queue MOC know about the changes made in the background MOC. I know that if I perform a fetch request on the main queue MOC, it will get the changes, but thats not what I want.p  pIs it OK to use the codeNSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotificationcode notification posted by the background MOC and call codemergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotificationcode on the main queue MOC This should then cause the codeNSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotificationcode notification of the main queue MOC to fire. I am listening for this notification in my view controllers and examine the codeuserInfocode for changes and redisplay data accordingly. I think you usually do it this way if you have one persistent store coordinator with two attached MOCs. But I am not sure if it is the right way to do, when you have childparent contexts.p

Why does this happen and how can I fix itp  pEDIT Sorry for not adding code, but below is the xml file. Notice I add a background to each TextView from img1 to img10. If I load this on my device, the program will crash. If I changed img9 to img7 and img10 to img7, then it will work fine. I cannot figure out why this occurs and I checked the sizes. They do not add up to 16MB.p  pSo, excuse my ignorance. I am new to android app creating, but I found that a OutOfMemory exception is being thrown.

Negative 78331 pI frequently use orgmode in Emacs to write long articles and thesis chapters and I keep finding myself frustrated that I have no intermediate view between a section outline and the full text. Does anybody know of a good way to include a summary of some sort like dot points or a paragraph of text that can easily be shown and hiddenp  pWhat Ive tried so far is to use drawers for the summaries. For examplep  precodeTITLE My article DRAWERS SUMMARY   Introduction  Data and hypotheses  Results  First attempt SUMMARY My first attempt didnt work so well. END  The text of the section goes here...  Second attempt SUMMARY I still havent started my second attempt. END codepre  pI find that this works great in that the summaries are for the most part hidden and I only see them when I want to. The problem is that I still cant get a summary overview this way, where I can see the summaries of each section and hide the full text.p  pMaybe there is no obvious solution to this in orgmode, in which case I am not averse to writing one but surely someone else has this same need so I thought I would ask if anyone else has found a solution first.p

Create new entry in strongvotestrong table.codeid, count, storageidcode brp  pIn situation where strongpoststrong is model i can use something like coderesources postscode then in posts controller through codenewcode and codecreatecode i can create new post, strongbut what in situation like this where i dont need posts controller nor post modelstrong So, question is which place is more appropriate to put logic for creating new post strongQ1strongp  pMy solution is to craete Storages controller with coderesource storages, only gt [new, create]code then through new and create of this controller to populate different tables in db Im forcing here codeonlycode because i dont see any point of other CRUD actions herelike showing all or one storage, because i will not use storages individually but in conjunction with other tables. So from viewsstorages through new.html.erb and create.html.erb i can construct new strongpoststrong strongQ2strongp  pAnother solution is to create Post controller which doesnt have corresponding post model as i stated before. Here im guessing i cant use restful routesCRUD because there is not codeidcode of post I only can make manually nonrestful routes likebr codepost postscreatetitlecontentcategory gt postscreate, as gt createpostcode  then from codeparams[title]code, codeparams[content]code and codeparams[category]code to populate other tables. strongQ3strongp  pIm new to rails so dont yell please Dp

Negative 78331 pI have some code that I use to copy a datarow into an object you supply.  The datarow is weakly typed.  Right now I am able to assign all data from the datarow to the object using reflection to get properties, iterating over those properties and setting their value using the datarow.  While this works, it only works when the underlying data types are the same not that big of a deal and more importantly, as long as the properties and fields are in the same order.   p  pstrongThere is ONE caveat to this question.strong  About 90 of the column names match the property names.  This is where I get hung up.  Example  In the database which I return a datarow from there is a field called DateCreated, the property for my object is called CreatedDate or ModifiedBy in the database and UpdateBy in the object property.  I cant rename the properties or the tables, so that easy answer is out of the question.p  pThe reason I am trying to do this is because my companies code that gets data from the database returns weakly typed dataset and when we update or add data to the database, we must populate a custom class and pass that to an update procedure.p  pIs there any way for me to compare the datarow columns and compare to the object property or assign new column names at runtime to the datarowp  precode    private static T CopyRecordltTgtDataRow record, dynamic newRecord              Get Properties         var properties  newRecord.GetType.GetProperties         var column  0         foreach PropertyInfo property in properties                      If property is generic list, continue             if property.PropertyType.IsGenericType ampamp property.PropertyType.GetGenericTypeDefinition  typeofListltgt continue              Check for dbnull, return null if true, or convert to correct type             var columnValue  Convert.IsDBNullrecord[column]  null  Convert.ChangeTyperecord[column], Nullable.GetUnderlyingTypeproperty.PropertyType  property.PropertyType              Set property for newRecord             property.SetValuenewRecord, columnValue             column                  return newRecord      codepre  pEDIT  Would using custom attributes work in this situation  I could prefix my class properties with the equivalent database column name.

Negative 78331 pI need some help using a regular expression to reformat a number into currency.  My input will be something either like the string 123 or 123.45.  I would want to replace 123 with 123.00 and leave 123.45 as is.  The regular expression will also be used to validate input, so both 123 and 123.45 should match.  I have already done something like this with a SSN where I reformat a 9digit string into nnnnnnnnn format, but the currency string is stumping me.  p  pFor the SSN my regular expression and replacement string were thesep  pcode000666[08]d200d20000d4codep  pcode145codep  pThis is the regular expression Im trying can even deal with commas BR code[09]1,3,[09]3.[09]2code BR where in the replacement 1 is the part before the . and 2 is after.  I want the replacement string to show 2 if there is something or .00 if 2 is blank.  How do I do itp  pEdit to add more context  Let me explain why I am trying to do it this way.  I have some code to go to the database and get some strings and display them.  I deliberately dont know or care what those strings are.  I can also edit those strings in a text box.  Then people started asking for the strings to be displayed in a different format than they are stored.  First it started with a string representing the SSN where 123456789 should be displayed, and edited, in the format 123456789.  So I wrote some code to allow me to define a regex string and a replacement string, for each database string.  These strings accomplish the reformatting, plus the regex string is used to validate the input from the text box.  And all this worked fine for the SSN string, using the regex and replacement I listed above.  Now they want to display the string representing currency 123 as 123.00.  So I have the infrastructure to support this, if I can come up with the right regex string and replacement string.  My code doesnt know this is currency.  It just knows its a generic string that should be rewritten before being displayed.p

Negative 78331 pI need to run a series of calls over websockets via Socket.IO clientside.  Since Im not using .ajax, jQuerys deferred functions wont integrate as well and Ill have to manually handle promises.  With every websocket call, I pass a callback and Im quickly seeing how this project could spiral out of control.  Heres a simplified example of how my websocket calls work excluding all connection handling codep  precodefunction js2nodenodeFunction, data, callback     socket.emitincoming, nodeFunction, data, callback   function sampleServerCall     js2nodesampleCall, something, sampleCallback   function sampleCallbackjson      Handle data   sampleServerCall codepre  pI will be talking to the server quite a bit, all calls will be asynchronous, but some will need to come back in a specific order.

Deferred is a new concept to me but Ive read its supposed to help in situations such as this.  I feel like there has to be a better way than what Im currently doing.  Can anyone help me set this up more efficientlyp
Negative 78331 ptoday i encountered a very weird problem on joomla that is file does not exist 500.shtml and 400.shtml.

Any help would be appreciated the most.p

However cMatrix doesnt give me the same results. Here the implementation of the Matrix multiplication in the codecppcode p  precode    int i, n, j     for i  0 ilt1 i              for n  0 nlt7 n                      for j  0 jlt2 j                              dgtcMatrix[i][n]  dgtpfMatrix[i][j]  dgtwcMatrix[j][n]                          dgtcMatrix[i][n]  1  dgtr  dgtcMatrix[i][n]               codepre  pstrongEditstrongp  pI modified the loop following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma205283012419003Ben Voigta answer.

Negative 78331 pI am developing a directX 11 application. I am using IDXGIFactory2CreateSwapChainForHwnd to create the swap chain after creating the DX11 device. The DX11 code is in an object that gets destroyed then recreated to render another video stream to the same HWND window handle. p  pOn the first run of the application IDXGIFactory2CreateSwapChainForHwnd succeeds no problem. Then the application destroys the object with the DX11 code which destroys the DX11 device and swapchain etc. It goes to reinit the DX11 code again with the same HWND and this time IDXGIFactory2CreateSwapChainForHwnd FAILS with EACCESSDENIED. p  pI have read the MSDN documentation that says there is a problem with differed destruction when changing swap chains.

The driverlib and inc folders are taken from the TivaWARE folder while the src folder contains the blinky.c and startupgcc.c  file. Given the following if you use make you obtain the following p  precodeCUsersDDocumentsARMTivablinkygtmake driverlibadc.c4924 fatal error inchwadc.h No such file or directory compilation terminated. make  [driverlibadc.o] Error 1    codepre  pThis shows that the file adc.c in the driverlib folder cannot include the file hwadc.h inp  pI modified the Makefile following the suggestions belowp  precode Set Sources LIBSRCS     wildcard driverlib.c USERSRCS    wildcard src.c   Set Objects LIBOBJS     LIBSRCS.c.o USEROBJS    USERSRCS.c.o srcstartupgcc.o   Set Include Paths INCLUDES     Idriverlib              Iinc              Isrc codepre  pBetas solution was helpful , the only issue was that I did not want to edit all the files in the driverlib folder. The naming convention of the directories was not my decision. If you can see all the files in the driverlib folder youll find out that each driver file , CAN driver for example or ADC follows this convention                p  precodeinclude ltstdbool.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include inchwcan.h include inchwints.h include inchwnvic.h include inchwmemmap.h include inchwsysctl.h include inchwtypes.h include driverlibcan.h include driverlibdebug.h include driverlibinterrupt.h  codepre  pSo right now I understand where the issue is but I lack the understanding to edit the Makefile. Normally if files can.c and can.h are in folder driverlib using include can.h would suffice so I do not understand whats the point of using include driverlibcan.h if all .h and .c files are in the same driverlib folder . If I edit all the inc header then I can get a working binary file. The aim however was not to modify the default stock driver files and folders obtained from TI but to use the Makefile. p  pSo to clarify if you follow Betas solution and edit all the files , or if you put all the files in one big directory then you can get a working binary file. Also for future reference I found I could use Energia for what I am doing since it uses the same compiler and TIVA includes the complete peripheral library burned on ROM.p
Negative 78331 pI have a Sqlite3 table that has a codeLastUpdatedcode column containing UTC datetimes formatted as code20131224 071121code, and all the rows int that table were updated 2 days ago. p  pI want to write a codeSELECTcode statement to return only rows that havent been updated in a whilep  precodeSELECT LastUpdated FROM UserToken WHERE DATETIMELastUpdated lt DATETIMEnow, 4 days codepre  pIm trying to run this query from Python using the sqlite3 standard lib, and I want the outdated period to be variable. For security, I tried to use the parameter substitution mentioned in the a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarysqlite3.html relnofollowsqlite3 standard lib documentationa to use a variable codestaledeltaparametercodep  pcodedbcursor.executeSELECT LastUpdated FROM UserToken WHERE TokenValid  1 AND DATETIMELastUpdated lt DATETIMEnow, , staledeltaparameter,codep  pThe first time I ran it, I set codestaledeltaparameter  4 dayscode and it correctly returned zero rows. Then I changed the value of codestaledeltaparametercode to 1 days and ran the query. Instead of the expected result of all rows, the query continued to return 0 rows. p  pWhen I restart my computer, it seems the query works fine the first time, but again, if I run the python script with one delta value, as soon as I change the delta value, the results continue to be the value from the first instance of running the query. Furthermore, if I write two SELECT statements where query1 is set at code4 dayscode which should return no rows and query2 at code1 dayscode which should return all rows and then after running the script once, I switch the values on those queries, the output of the queries doesnt switch. p  pI thought it might be incorrect sql queries, so I tried hardcoding the delta and running the query in  the Sqlite3 shell. Works just as I expect each time, so the query isnt wrong. p  pThen I tried expanding the variable codestaledeltaparametercode from coden dayscode to codeDATETIMEnow, n dayscode just in case the parameter substitution wasnt working correctly inside Sqlites special codeDATETIMEcode function. The weird behavior didnt change.p  pIs there some kind of caching happening within the Sqlite3 standard lib or within the Python DBAPI that might prevent updating the query passed to the underlying dbp  pTheres nothing I can find in the docs, but its the only theory that I can come up with that seems to fit this behavior. p  pI tried to find a way to print the assembled query that gets passed to the db from Python, so I can verify that the db isnt getting an updated version of the query, but I cant find any kind of method to print the assembled query from codedbcursor.execute...code. p  pHere is the actual codep  precodetilusertokensgostale  4 days staledeltaparameter  DATETIMEnow,s  tilusertokensgostale   dbcursor.execute                  SELECT UserToken, UserID, AppID                   FROM UserToken                   WHERE TokenValid  1 AND DATETIMELastUpdated lt                   , staledeltaparameter, alltokens  dbcursor.fetchall print lenalltokens  For debugging, shows me how many rows are returned codepre

Negative 78331 pI have recently started with Python again, and I am trying to write a module where lots of problems of the following kind occurp  pAn object codeProblemcode can hold a variable codeUnitcode. Unit can only be either inches, millimeters or meters.p  pThe module is supposed to be used by others, so I want the most easily usable solution to this. If possible I want the user to receive an error if they try to assign anything but one of those values.p  pI see this would be possible with objects where I define a codeunitClasscode class that inherits to daughter classes codeinchesClasscode, codemillimetersClasscode and codemetersClasscode. I would then make an instance of each, that the user can assign to the variable in question. But I think this might be confusing, unless that is a standard way to go about such a problemp  pThe other solution I came up with was set methods but since I dont use them for other variables, I wanted to avoid them in this case as well if possible.p  pIs there another way to do this using just the modules provided by a standard python installationp  pRegards,p  pRTTp

Negative 78331 pHi I am a pure novice in image processing especially with openCV. I want to write a program on blob detection that takes an image as an input and returns the color and centroid of the blob. My image consists purely of regular polygons in a black background. For eg. my image might consist of a green triangleequilateral or a red square in a black background. I want to use the simpleBlobDetection class in opencv and its detect function for this purpose. Since Im a novice a full program will be a lot of help to me.p
Negative 78331 pSo I had git running on my computer just fine. My password was saved with the osxkeychain thingy and everything ran smoothly. Today I decided I should be safe and enable google authenticator 2step authentication on all the sites that support it. Interestingly github supports it so I set it up. It works fine through the website interface. I proceed to branch a project Im working on and do a bit of work and then I try to push the new branch up. Not surprised at all when I find out my authentication doesnt work. What is surprising to me is that I cant seem to find anything at all on google to solve my problem. p  pmy initial error was thisp  precodegit push setupstream origin binarydev remote Invalid username or password. fatal Authentication failed for httpsgithub.com.git codepre  pI then purged my old password stuff to get the interactive prompt withp  precodegit credentialosxkeychain erase hostgithub.com protocolhttps codepre  pAnd that worked at getting rid of my old settings but now I getp  precodegit push setupstream origin binarydev Username for httpsgithub.com  Password for httpsgithub.com remote Invalid username or password. fatal Authentication failed for httpsgithub.com.git codepre  pSo git itself doesnt seem to know about the google authenticator. I literally cant seem to find any information on this. About half the pages are about how to set it up on the website and the other half are how to fork the actual google authenticator source code. I may not be creative enough with my keywords though. There may also be no solution but then I have to wonder why github offers 2factor auth at all Is there anyone out there whos been stuck here like me and has found a way out Any help would be emgreatlyem appreciated. I just want git to work like it did before I added the 2step auth to github.p  pThanks in advance,br Maxp

Negative 78331 pSo Im writing a linux kernel module that involves writing to a proc file. Unfortunately something is going wrong with the newline character. If I open it with vim, it shows as numnumnum. If I cat it, it says numnumnum. It should go to a new line at the end of each num.p  pMy code for writing each entry to the proc file admittedly seems kind of hacky. p  precode    bufSize  snprintfstr,0,lun,var     str  charkmallocbufSizesizeofchar,GFPKERNEL     snprintfstr,bufSize,lun,var     memcpymsgmsglen,str,bufSize     msglenbufSize     kfreestr codepre  pI dont know how long the string will be, so the first snprintf gets the length needed for the buffer. The buffer is initialized, then snprintf is called again. The string is then copied to msg, which contains the data for the proc file. The pointer is incremented by the length of the existing message.p  precode    int procfilereadchar buffer, char bufferlocation, offt offset, int     bufferlength, int eof, void data       int ret      printkKERNINFO procfileread procs calledn, PROCFSNAME      if offset gt 0       we have finished to read, return 0      ret   0      else        fill the buffer, return the buffer size      memcpybuffer, msg, msglen     ret  msglen           return ret codepre  pThis is pretty much copied and pasted from a tutorial.p  pThanksp

Negative 78331 pThis is more a general question rather than to a specific programming language. I cant seem to find any solution or idea how to get this working.p  pThe situation is the following Currently im working on my Cartablet Install Basicly a Android Tablet replacing the OEM Navigation. The Tablet is hardwired into the dash and will stay there aslong as I own the car. p  pI would want the tablet to get access to the internet permanently when im in the car. The tablet itself doesnt have a simslot and i dont want to spend money on either a different tablet or a 2nd simcard that would provide me direct internet access via 3G.p  pMy solution would be to create a Hotspot on my Iphone 5 and connect the Android Tablet Lenovo IdeaTab A1000F to it. This already works but I do have to activate the Hotspot manually everytime i get into my car. As the car moves obviously.. , a specific GPS Range for actions is not a great solution for me.p  pSo the question is Is there a way i.e. with Beacons or NFC to activate my Iphone Hotspot automatically as soon as I get in the car p  pYou dont need to provide a fully working answer but already Ideas or examples would help me out. I just feel kind of lost without ideas at the moment as it looks like iBeacons arent able to perform actions the way I would need them to and NFC is not supported by iPhone without further modifications.. Correct me if im wrong herep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 78331 pI have been working on implementing a search method within codeigniter that uses codeigniters pagination functionality. This required a bit of research up front since we are including filters and a user could select a variable number of filters, throwing off the urisegment count. I have a working solution below only posted code that i felt was relative to understanding the process so not to confuse. If I missed anything let me know that would get someone started if they run across the same issue, but want to ask a few questionsp  pQUESTIONSp  ol lipIs there a better, more efficient way to go about having pagination on filtered search resultspli lipIs there anything anyone would do to improve THIS methodpli lipHow could one display the current uri in the users browser after the initial post The way the pagination library functions it does not display the firsturl until it has been clicked via the generated links.

If the post array is empty, but the uri segment contains values, this would mean that we         are viewing listings narrowed by the search filters.

Negative 78331 pI have been tasked with creating a piece of software for my client that will compute certain system statistics in the background this is not a foreground process. The target platform is Windows XP  7 and the languagetechnology is flexible. However, I feel that the clients most challenging requirement is that the software must run when the PC starts and it must be tamperaware. That is, the client wants to receive an email if a user attempts to stopdisable the software.p  pI recognize that at any given time somebody can pick up the machine and drop it in a river and theres no way I can alert the client that such has happened. I explained this and their response is that its not a problem if it emdoes not come back onlineem. I guess they expect to monitor which systems go offline for extended periods of time and deal with those in some way.p  pThe challenge is that they want to receive an alert e.g. an email notification in the event that emthe system was up and running but the statistical software was notem. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the notification emailp  pa user uses task manager to kill my process and then runs other programs. The next time my process starts it should notify that it was tampered with. b user disables the mechanism that starts the process on boot e.g. registry key, reboots the machine, and runs other programs. The next time my process starts it should notify that it was tampered with.p  pFinally, the client prefers this to be a portable app and not require a Windows installation.p  pAs I said, the technology is flexible we can use C, C.NET, WSH, or anything else for the Windows platform. Ive been developing software for nearly a decade now but have not encountered a need for tamperawareness. So the question is, what are some different methods for making my Windows desktop program tamperaware p  pThe notification piece is simple as I can just call a foreign web service when the program restarts and the web service can send the email notification. The tricky part is the logic to determine if the system was running while my program was notp

Negative 78331 pI am making a score sheet to keep track of the score in a quiz competition.

Can anyone provide any guidance as to what the most efficient means of going about this isp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI was hoping for something prettier than an ifstatement included as an answer below, but I dont have any better idea at this point.  Honestly, Im not sure I understand why this got down voted.  Its true I havent included the code I have because though I have thought about the problem for a while, I have not really known where to start.  In fact, I specifically asked to merely be provided some guidance with the proper means of going about this because I did not want to appear to be asking other people to do my work for me.  Nonetheless, I will show the logic I am trying to reproduce.  Im not really sure what else I can do.p  precode     Team Score       Rank Description    Team Tie ID                250   High Score                    0  TeamScore1    30   Low Score         TeamTie1   0                 60   Middle Score                  0                 250   High score TIE              1  TeamScore2    30   Low Score         TeamTie2   0                250   High score TIE              1                 250   High Score                    0  TeamScore3    30   Low Score TIE   TeamTie3   2                 30   Low Score TIE               2  codepre  pBasically, whenever any of the teams are tied at the end of a quiz, those two teams are asked more questions till their score changes to remove the tie.  I want to be able to detect when the teams are tied by producing the codeTeamTiecode array based on the codeTeamScorecode array.  If the best way to accomplish this is by using an ifstatement, then fine, but I just though there might be an easier way.p

If I plot the two objects separately I get nice figures of both of them.br Just for completing the picture of what I have, the last part of the defined function codegeommacrocode looks like this codeAtPoscode and codeGeomlstcode contain the x,y,z coordinates of what I am plotting, and codedistbtnpointscode is another defined functionp  precodefor i in range 1, NCenter1     xp, yp, zp  AtPos[i1][0], AtPos[i1][1], Pos[i1][2]     AtRadiifloatAtRadius[element[i1]1]     mlab.points3dxp,yp,zp, colorAtColor[element[i1]1], modesphere,          scalefactorAtRadii, scalemodenone      Draw connecting lines     for j in rangei,NCenter         xpc, ypc, zpc  AtPos[j][0], AtPos[j][1], AtPos[j][2]         xpin, ypin, zpin  floatGeomlst[i1][0], floatGeomlst[i1][1], floatGeomlst[i1][2]         xpcin, ypcin, zpcin  floatGeomlst[j][0], floatGeomlst[j][1], floatGeomlst[j][2]         if distbtnptsxpin, ypin, zpin, xpcin, ypcin, zpcin lt BondMax             mlab.plot3d[xp,xpc], [yp,ypc], [zp,zpc], color1.0,1.0,1.0, tuberadius0.005 codepre  pI have tried changing the codeextentcode in the isosurface, using the minimum values of x, y and z, but the isosurface gets distorted not sure why Any help will be highly appreciated.

This means that a user cannot scroll inside the UITextView because their touch events are being passed to the dark gray view in the back and scrolling that instead.  They also cannot select and edit their text on the top 3 lines.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQKLOO.png altenter image description herep  pI think I could do a workaround by capturing the coordinates of all tap events and checking if the keyboard is open and how tall the UITextView is, then selecting the correct element to receive the touch event.  But this is brittle solution that is more complicated with rotation.  Is there something Im missing in my autogrowing text view approach, or some easier fixp

Negative 78331 pSo, I have setup a multichannel mixer and a Remote IO unit to mixplay several buffers of PCM data that I read from audio files. For short sound effects in my game, I load the whole file into a memory buffer using codeExtAudioFileReadcode.p  pFor my background music, lets say I have a 3 minute compressed audio file. Assuming its encoded as mp3  128 kbps 44,100 Hz stereo, that gives around 1 MB per minute, or 3 MB total. Uncompressed, in memory, I believe its around ten times that if I remember correctly. I could use the exact same method as for small files I believe codeExtAudioFileReadcode takes care of the decoding, using the single hardware decoder when available, but Id rather not read the whole buffer at once, and instead stream it at regular intervals from disk.p  pThe first thing that comes to mind is going one step below to the nonextended Audio File Services API and use codeAudioFileReadPacketscode, like sop  ol lipPrepare two buffers A and B, each big enough to hold say 5 seconds of audio. During playback,     start reading from one buffer and switch to the other one when reaching the end i.e., they make up the two halves of a ring buffer.pli lipRead first 5 seconds of audio from file into buffer A.pli lipRead next 5 seconds of audio from file into buffer B.pli lipBegin playback from buffer A.pli lipOnce the play head enters buffer B, load next 5 seconds of audio into buffer A.pli lipOnce the play head enters buffer A again, load next 5 seconds of audio into buffer B. pli lipGo to 5pli ol  pIs this the right approach, or is there a better wayp

This black container is the application itself in my design.p  pAs you can see the black border around the blue box has a subtle green shadow in the outer edges of the  page.p  pThe problem is that because the codelthtmlgtcode is the application in AIR it means that the application can never touch the edge of the screen due to the fact that AIR is treating the codelthtmlgtcode as the application edge rather than the container codeltdivgtcode for the black border.p  pAny ideas on how to get around this The only thing I could think of was some crazy JavaScript that could offset the application somehow.... Anyone else had this problemp

Negative 78331 pI have a git repository for an Excel Addin I wrote, so the path is CProgram FilesMicrosoft Office 15rootoffice15LibraryBTRTools That Library path is the required install parent of Excel addins for them to work properly, so I cant change it.  I have UAC turned on in both Win7 and Win8.1.  In Win7 everything works fine, however in Win8.1 I get a status of basically everything changed but even some weirder stuff of files first mentioned as deleted then mentioned again in same status as untracked.  The repository is really clean, despite what git status says, but I cant pull or do reset hard or anything.p  pIf I run Console2 the app from which I issue git bash commands from using the Run As Administrator option, everything works fine and the status is clean no changes listed.  And I can do a pull and any other command correctly.p  pIn both Win7 and Win8.1 I have manually granted Full Access rights to the BTRTools folder for my user even though I am already part of the Administrators group in both and verified that Console2 is indeed running as my local user in Win8.1.p  pHas anyone experienced this problem before and have any ideas on how I can get Console2git to work properly in Win8.1 without resorting to always running getting prompted Console2 in Run As Administrator modep  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI discovered I got the same behavior in Win7 under a specific condition.  I wrote a script to batch process several git commands by creating and running a c emProcessProcessStartInfoem and it was displaying the same behavior as the Win8.1 Console2.  Calling the exact same commands directly in Win7 console vs the Win7 script i.e. git status displayed two different results.p  pThe script which was written in LINQPad was running as my current user, but I am assuming that when it created and launched a emProcessProcessInfoem it was somehow running under a different user.  I was able to correct this problem in my script by providing emmyem credentialsp  precodep.UserName  Environment.UserName p.Password  new System.Security.SecureString foreach var c in password.ToCharArray       p.Password.AppendChar c   codepre  pstrongNotestrong I verified that the security groupssettings for the my user in both Win7 and Win8.1 appear to be same part of Admin group.p  pstrongUpdate GetACL Outputstrongp  pI ran GetACL  formatlist on the BTRTools directory on both machines.

Negative 78331 pIve been trying to teach myself FRP and bacon.js specifically by diving in head first on a new project. Ive gotten pretty far on my own but recently ran into a problem that I cant seem to fight my way throughp  pI have an interface with a set of clickable objects. When an object is clicked, detailed information for that object is loaded in a panel to the right. p  pWhat I need is the ability to select multiple, to accumulate those objects into an array and show a bulk actions panel when more than one is selected.p  pSo far I havep  ul lia SelectMultiple boolean property that represents the current UI modeli lia CurrentObject stream that holds the currently selected objectli ul  pIve gotten somewhat close with thisp  precodevar SelectedObjects  CurrentObject.filterSelectMultiple.skipDuplicates.scan[], functiona,b     return a.concat[b]  codepre  pThere are a few problemsp  ol liThe value of SelectedObjects represents the objects selected over all time, it doesnt reset when SelectMultiple state changes.li liThe value of SelectObjects does not include the original CurrentObject of course because the scan accumulator seed is an empty array, not the current value of CurrentObject.li ol  pThe fact that Im looking to use the current value of a property directly seems to be a hint that theres a fundamental issue here. I have a notion that the answer involves flapMapLatest and spawning a new stream every time SelectMultiple changes, funneling selected orders into this new stream and accumulating, but I cant quite work out what that should look like.p  pOf course there is an additional problem that skipDuplicates only skips consecutive duplicates. I can probably work this one out on my own but a solution that addresses that issue would be ideal.p  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciatedp

If I ever reply a particular email which is missing the codeMESSAGEIDcode header using those email clients, the sent reply also acquires the same codeINREPLYTOcode header codelt4185615914882731559unknownmsgidgtcode and the reply indeed stays at the same conversation as expected.p  pSo, I would like to ask how they achieve this, do they somehow generate the codeINREPLYTOcode header codelt4185615914882731559unknownmsgidgtcode Is there a rule or a workaroundp

Negative 78331 pI am trying to make an asynchronous call to Oracle, but it gets executed synchronously. Please look at below code and tell me what I am doing wrong.p  pIve installed ODAC ODTwithODAC112032032bit.zip and use the Oracle.DataAccess.dll assembly for my calls to Oracle. Before I used the deprecated System.Data.OracleClient with the same result.p  precodeusing System ... using System.Threading using System.Threading.Tasks using Oracle.DataAccess.Client  namespace OracleTest    public partial class Form1  Form        public Form1            InitializeComponent           async private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e            OracleConnection connection  new OracleConnectionUser IdmyuserPasswordmypwdData Sourcemydb       connection.Open          OracleCommand command  new OracleCommandselect countcol from bigtable, connection        TaskltObjectgt result  command.ExecuteScalarAsync       label1.Text  BEFORE  DateTime.Now.ToLocalTime           label1.Text  await result       label1.Text    AFTER   DateTime.Now.ToLocalTime        connection.Close        connection.Dispose           codepre  pIt takes some minutes for the dbms to get the count. What I expect is this ExecuteScalarAsync gets called and it gives Oracle a call. Immediately after the BEFORE time is written to label1. Then I wait for the Oracle query to finish and take its result. Then the AFTER time is written to label1. So BEFORE and AFTER should be different. However, they are always the same time i.e. the time when the query returned its result. Why is thatp  pI also triedp  precode  CancellationToken cancellationToken  new CancellationToken   TaskltObjectgt result  command.ExecuteScalarAsynccancellationToken codepre  pand it didnt change anything.

Negative 78331 pMy question involves how to reuse code, for an algorithm, that is codeconstcode unaware can be used with constant or mutable objectsp  pLets take for example the codestdvectorcode iterators.br There are two iterators classes that share similar methods  codestdvectoriteratorcode and codestdvectorconstiteratorcode.  p  pBoth iterators point to emslotsem in the vector or outside the vector such as codestdvectorendcode.br They both have increment and decrement methods. The primary difference is that the codeconstiteratorcode cannot be used for writing to the the vector.p  pIf I were writing the code for iterators, how could I have the codeiteratorcode and codeconstiteratorcode share methods that are not dependent on the constness of the access operationp  pIn my present code, I am duplicating the code for codeforeachcode and codevisitcode methods, because of the difference in accesibility.  The codeforeachcode loop is the same codeforcode loop the difference being the one applies a constvisitor and the other applies a mutablevisitor.p  precodestruct Object  struct ConstVisitor     Visit function cannot modified the given object.   virtual void visitconst Objectamp o  0   struct MutableVisitor     The visit function may modify the given object   virtual void visitObjectamp o  0   struct Container    const unsigned int LIMIT  16   Object objcontainer[LIMIT]     Apply the readonly constant visitor    to each object in the container   void foreachConstVisitoramp cv const         Note  this loop management is the same      as the loop management for the mutable foreach method.     for unsigned int i  0 i lt LIMIT i            cv.visitobjcontainer[i]              Apply the readwrite mutable visitor    to each object in the container.   void foreachMutableVisitoramp mv         Note  this loop management is the same      as the loop management for the const foreach method.     for unsigned int i  0 i lt LIMIT i            mv.visitobjcontainer[i]            codepre  pIn the above example, the mechanics are the same for both codeforeachcode functions.  Only the visitor changes. The same slots in the array are being passed to the codevisitcode functions.p  pThis could be changed slightly by using one visitor with two codevisitcode methods, but the fundamental issue still exists.p  precodestruct Object  struct SingleVisitor     Method cant modify the object.   virtual void visitconst Objectamp o  0     Method may modify the object.   virtual void visitObjectamp o  0   struct Container    const unsigned int LIMIT  16   Object objcontainer[LIMIT]     Apply a visitor to each item in container.   void foreachSingleVisitoramp sv const        for unsigned int i i lt LIMIT i             Should call the visit method,        constant object.       sv.visitobjcontainer[i]              Apply a visitor to each item in container.   void foreachSingleVisitoramp sv        for unsigned int i i lt LIMIT i             Should call the visit method,          mutable object.       sv.visitobjcontainer[i]          codepre  pWith a visitor class that has two methods vs. two separate classes, the containers codeforeachcode methods still have the same mechanics.  The looping is the same, just a different method is called.  p  pSo, is there a way to have one codeforeachcode loop that calls the appropriate visitor base on constnessp

Negative 78331 pIs there a compiler option in visual studio 2012 that tells it to compile C only and not C  I am porting some legacy C code into visual studio.  There are cases where the code compares pointers to functions like strchr.  In C strchr has only one prototype, but in C it has two.  That causes errors when the C compiler cannot determine which prototype to use.  Instead of having to change all the code, Id like to just be able to tell the compiler to compile C and not C.  Is this possiblep

Negative 78331 pIve looked around for someone else trying to do something like that, but I havent been able to find it. Here goesp  pI have a CMS where users are able to select HEX color values for six specific colors. Theyre saved in the db like codesite.color1code for example. The problem is, I cant pull these DB colors into my sass file. The best I can do is create a .css.erb file, copy over every rule from the precompiled css, and replace all instances of code555code with codelt site.color1 gtcode.p  pIdeally though, Id like sassrails to look out for any rule that contains code555code and spit that rule out in a separate stylesheet. For bonus points, it would automatically replace code555code with codelt site.color1 gtcode. Ive never heard of such a thing, but if its possible, that would automate this whole nightmarish process.p  pIf this kind of thing doesnt exist, is it even something thats theoretically possible for a gem working with the rails asset pipeline to pull offp  pIm on the latest rails and sassrails gems.p

Negative 78331 pI wonder if it is possible to create a Python class with following propertiesp  ol liIt should have all properties of the list or dict, i.e. inherited from one of themli liWhen the instance is called it would return an element predefined by index or keyli ol  pFor examplep  precodeclass Adict     def initself, name         self.name  name         self[a]  1         self[b]  2  a  Aa codepre  pand when instance codeacode is called it would return code1code as defined by the key codeacode. The original access through the keys should still be available.p  pThe problem Xp  pI have a class codeFruitscode that is inherited from codedictcode. In codeselfcode it can have several instances of class codeFruitcode, however often there is only one instance.

Negative 78331 pI had a working codeMakefilecode for small C applications that just had a couple of source code files inside a single folder that was also the output folder.

In a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8801539gnumakekindofdoublecolonanother threada I learned that this is a emstatic pattern ruleem so I guess this is where I made the mistake. But writing it down just now, I think the error could be earlier already. I might have made a mistake when defining codeCXXOBJScode. Could it be that the objects in that list are of the form codebuildsrctest.ocode instead of codebuildtest.ocodep  pBut how can I fix the codeaddprefixcode line to produce the correct output And where does the error in the title come from where am I mixing those I thought it could be about the codeSRCDIRcode in the static pattern rule because I probably misunderstood how it worked, but omitting it doesnt make the error go away. Moreover assuming codeCXXOBJScode is working correctly later, if the static pattern rule checks every file in the list codeCXXOBJScode for a match with code.ocode, and then has a dependency on the same file with ending code.cppcode, then that is also not correct because of the codebuildcode folder prefix.p  pAll in all, Im very confused about how to handle the folder prefixes correctly and any advice is greatly appreciatedp

IE a corrupt file that wont play.p  pIm sure it has something to do with the settings for writing the asset out wether it is the video writing or the audio writing Im not sure at all. It could even be the reading of the asset that is causing it to be corrupt.

Negative 78331 p I have some problem with mysql query.  Im trying to build table with all products ids, product names, manufacturers names and quantities per attribute in column per attribute  Getting ids and names is easy. Problem starts when I try to JOIN columns per attribute and fill it with quantities. Some attributes are not assinged to product therefore dont have idstockavailable quantity in psstockavailable  In php code im getting attibutes ids from db into array. Than i build query based on that array.  I wont be pasting whole query as its 465 lines long including spaces between lines. Will paste beginning, some part of middle query and the and.  If I run a query with just i  1 t1.idattribute1p  precodeSELECT     ps2productlang.idproduct,     ps2productlang.name,     ps2categorylang.name AS manufacturername,     t1.idattribute1  FROM ps2productlang  LEFT JOIN ps2product     ON ps2productlang.idproduct  ps2product.idproduct  LEFT JOIN ps2categorylang     ON ps2product.idcategorydefault  ps2categorylang.idcategory  LEFT JOIN ps2category     ON ps2categorylang.idcategory  ps2category.idcategory  JOIN      SELECT     ps2stockavailable.idproduct AS idproduct,         ps2stockavailable.quantity AS idattribute1      FROM ps2stockavailable      JOIN         ps2productattributecombination      ON         ps2stockavailable.idproductattribute  ps2productattributecombination.idproductattribute      WHERE         ps2productattributecombination.idattribute  1      ORDER BY         idproduct  AS t1  ON     ps2productlang.idproduct  t1.idproduct  WHERE ps2productlang.idlang  7 AND ps2categorylang.idlang  7 AND ps2productlang.idproduct gt 12 AND ps2category.idparent  18 OR ps2category.idparent  84  ORDER BY     manufacturername, name codepre  pi get products with idattribute  1 with column attribute1 filled with data quantities  Part below is being repeated in query as many times as there are attributes created in prestashop.p  precodeJOIN      SELECT     ps2stockavailable.idproduct AS idproduct,         ps2stockavailable.quantity AS idattribute1      FROM ps2stockavailable      JOIN         ps2productattributecombination      ON         ps2stockavailable.idproductattribute  ps2productattributecombination.idproductattribute      WHERE         ps2productattributecombination.idattribute  1      ORDER BY         idproduct  AS t1  ON     ps2productlang.idproduct  t1.idproduct codepre  pAnd now the more JOINs there are in query the less results i get from DB as if JOINs worked like ANDs.  As i mentioned already some attributes are not assigned to products therefore no quantities.

Negative 78331 pIm building a fairly complex AngularJS application. It needs to have the ability to easily incorporate new functionality on a per user basis. For example say that the application is completed and 6 months later I need to add functionality for a modal in a users settings. This button should only be available to those users. A month later more functionality is required etc. etc.p  pI was wondering what the best way to do this would be. p  pI plan on trying to manually bootstrap angular. New functionality would be in standalone modules that get dynamically loaded. There will be a login screen that is similar for every user. After logging in there would be an api call to get the angular modules for that user which will then be bootstrapped and angular loaded up.p  pAnother option I was looking to into was using the codeinjectcode service but that would require to have all the modules bootstrapped into the main app to begin with. And with a potentially unlimited number of modules that doesnt seem very feasible.p  pAny advice would be much appreciatedp

Negative 78331 pPlease help me with what I think is my fundamental misunderstanding of lists and csv.p  pI have a text file of tabdelimited data this is why I am using csv. It has a header row with 4 headings, and then 40 rows of data. I am trying to create a programme that will search the content of the text file and when a match is found will then print that row of data.p  pMy first step is to create a list from the text file.p  precodeimport csv  list[] create a new empty list with opendata.txt,rb as f     nextf skip heading row in text file I cannot get csv.Dictreader instead to work as an alternative to this step     data  csv.readerf,delimitert read text file with csv     for row in data         list.appendrow add the data from the text file to the list codepre  pWhen I run this programme as it is, I can type codeprint listcode and it prints the contents of the text file, each row enclosed in a []. When I type codeprint rowcode it prints the LAST row entry in the text file. When I type codeprint row[0]code it prints the first column of this last row, and so on for row[1], row[2] and row[3]. When I type codeprint lenlistcode it returns 40 which is the number of rows excluding the header.p  pI cannot print any of the other rows from the text file. Have I done something wrong in creating my list How can I access other rows and check that I have created my list correctlyp  pI am having problems with what I think are the next steps, and I want to make sure that I have got this first step correct I have read all the documentation I can find and all vaguelyrelated stack overflow queries and I just do not seem to understand this. I would really appreciate some helpp  pEdit I have been asked to explain what I am trying to use this for.p  pI have a text file data.txt. It has rows of tabdelimited data under four columns.p  pI want to make a search function so that The user inputs which column to search by The user inputs a search term The programme searches the list to find a match The programme then prints the whole row containing the matching data.p  pE.g. Name  Age Address Job Marks 49  Manchester   Teacher Smith 52  Somerset    Banker Williams  83  Kent    Studentp  pTo do this I think I need to make the text file into a list that has been parsed with csv because the data is tabdelimited.

Negative 78331 pEDIT honest recommendation If you want to stream from a PMD in realtime, use C. Any UI is simple to create and there os quite a mighty library, a hrefhttpwww.metricam.net relnofollowMetriCama by Metrilus AG, which supports streaming for a variety of 3DCameras. I am able to get stable 45 fps with that.p  pORIGINALp  pIve been trying to get depth information from a a hrefhttpwww.pmdtec.comproductsservicesreferencedesign.php relnofollowPMD camboard nanoa and visualize it in a GUI. The Information is delivered as a 165x120 float array.p  pAs I also want to use the Data for analysis purpose image quality, white noise etc., I need to grab the frames at a specific framerate. The problem is, that the SDK which PMD delivers with its camera for MATLAB amp C only provides the possibility to grab single frames by calling p  precodepmdUpdatehnd codepre  pso the framerate is dependent on how often you poll the image data.p  pI initially tried to do the analysis in MATLAB, but I couldnt get more than 30 fps out of the camera and adding some further code to the loop made it impossible to work with I need at least reliable 25 fps.p  pI then switched to C, where I got rates of up to 70 fps, but could not visualize the data.p  pThen I tried it with Qt, which is based on CC  it should therefore be fast polling the image data  and where I could easily include the libraries of the PMDSDK. As I am new to Qt, though, I do not know much about the UIElements.p  pSo my questionbr Is there any performant way to visualize a 2Dfloatarray on a QtGUI If not, how about anything useful in Visual Studio with Cp  pI know that drawing every pixel one by one on a QGraphicsView is dumb, but I tried it, and I get a whopping framerate of .4 fps...p  pThanks for any helpful suggestionsp  pJannikp
Negative 78331 pHello my fellow humansp  pI have two rooted android phones, each running a chroot environment using the Linux Deploy app HTC desire 510 running Kali Linux and vodafone smart 4 mini running Ubuntu.

It is also possible to omit any default MIME type and let the  clients browser guess an appropriate action instead. Typically the  browser will decide based on the files extension then.

Negative 78331 pI am relatively new to C and Im making a project that I wish to be cross platform. I want to use an external library that has sworn to be cross platform as well. I am wondering how I should include this within my projectp  pFrom what I can understand, I have two options. Build the libraries before hand on every platform I wish to use, then handle which library is linked within my build process not very platform independent. Or I can include the entire source of the library and build it along with my project.p  pAre these my only options for handling cross platform libraries Maybe I am not understanding how the process completely works yet, so any help would be awesomep  pPS Im using CMake to build my project.p  pThanksp

Negative 78331 pI have a relatively new project that employs a microservice architecture. I feel pretty good about the size and granularity of the individual services, with the exception or our security service.p  pI have three main services, lets say codefooservicecode, codebarservicecode, and codebazservicecode. These services never need to communicate, but all three services regularly talk via HTTP requests to the codesecurityservicecode. I want this to stop for a variety of reasons the biggest is that each request to my individual services spawns a request to the security service, which can turn into several extra hops once you account for load balancing, etc. Ive been reading Software Architecture Patterns by Mark Richards, and he recommends in these instances you should share databases and violate DRY copy the required functionality into each service. Still, he uses this example with smaller utility classes, which may not really apply in this instance. p  pThe security service isnt that big, so I could definitely copy it into each of the other services. That said, its just big enough that I dont feel great copying and pasting it  314 relevant lines of code according to coveralls java so theres a lot more actual code . I could easily turn it into a module that each service brings in but then my services have a shared dependency and that has bit me in the past. Of course the security code will grow over time as we add authentication methods, but we arent reinventing the wheel when it comes to auth so Its mostly integrating with other libraries and authentication services. That is, I dont imagine this particular code base getting huge.p  pSo my question, should I copy and paste the code or build a module that every service brings in Thanksp
Negative 78331 pIm currently trying make a codequeueHandlercode that takes an object array as input for executing drive commands on a simple Double robot. Im currently trying to use GCD in order to serially execute my functions, but when Im using codedispatchsynccode on my queue in wont wait until the codeNSTimercode has run its course, but will continue to try and execute the commands from the next object in my array.p  pI have 3 functions, one which simply initializes an codeNSMutableArraycodeloadCommands with 2 objects and runs the codequeueHandlercode, this is called when I toggle a switch. Then the codequeueHandlercode reads the variables from the objectstype, timing, queueNr to determine what type of drive function will be executed and for how long. This I thought could be done in a switch statement, and I figured it would be great if the app could execute the function on the main threadthat is ok but it should wait until the codeNSTimercode has run its course. I thought encapsulating the switch case with a dispatchsync would solve this but it promptly skips to the next iteration in the loop and tries to execute the next function instead, which is drive backwards for 3 seconds.p  pWhen I test this with a single object in the array the command will be executed without trouble. I suppose Im locking up the main thread somehow.

Negative 78331 pApologies in advance if Im on the wrong track here. In the past Ive only used C libraries to build up Lucene queries, but now Im building a search into Kentico CMS which uses Lucene query parser syntax for advanced search queries. Ive been through the a hrefhttplucene.apache.orgcore303queryparsersyntax.html relnofollowLucene docsa and understand the different options in isolation but Im still unclear about how to combine them.p  pMy content will all be indexed where each document shares a set of fields. Some of these fields are more relevant than others for search results. I want the user to enter a single search term which might include more than one word. p  pFirst, I want the search words to be regarded as separate i.e. not a phrase. I want their proximity and frequency to influence ranking as I understand is default with Lucene. But I also want their appearance in certain fields to boost the results ranking. I also want to set a fuzziness which applies to the whole search.p  pSay the user enters strongterm1 term2strongp  pWould I be right in saying that the following would return all results with both words in the emtitleem field with a boost of 2 and fuzziness of 0.8 applied p  precodetitleterm1 AND term220.8 codepre  pFirst, is this right Second, if I want to apply the same to a second lesser boosted field  emsummaryem  I assume itd bep  precodetitleterm1 AND term220.8 summaryterm1 AND term20.50.8 codepre  pFinally, how can I add a general unboosted search of the whole indexed document regardless of field to this query Is it simplyp  precodeterm1 AND term20.8 titleterm1 AND term220.8 summaryterm1 AND term20.50.8 codepre  pI suspect Im way out here so guidance appreciatedp

Negative 78331 pI succeeded to implement a radio button using this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8337180customsinglechoicelistviewquestiona by skpal202. But in this question, it only explains how to get the position of selected view clicked which solves the question asked. Adapting that code to my app I encountered difficulties. My question is, are there pointers towards adding selected radio button for new added items in the case of array adapter. p  pHere the logic being that whenever a newly added itemeg text from an edit text etc is put into an arrayadapter the radio button checks as true to the newly created item ignoring previously selected item. p  pNB all the newly created items should take up radio buttons.p

Negative 78331 pAfter going through SO questions, I learnt that,p  pemEncapsulationem is about protecting eminvariantsem and hiding emimplementationem details.p  pemAbstractionem has to do with separating eminterfaceem from emimplementationem.p  pFrom class room java a hrefhttpwww.cs.berkeley.edujrs61blec18.pdf relnofollowtraininga, I learnt that, emEncapsulationem has following advantages,p  blockquote   pWhy encapsulation is your friendp      p[1] The implementation is independent of the functionality. A programmer    who has the documentation of the interface can implement a new version    of the module or ADT independently. A new, better implementation can    replace an old one.p      p[2] Encapsulation prevents Doug from writing applications that corrupt a    modules internal data. In realworld programming, encapsulation    reduces debugging time. A lot.p      p[3] ADTs can guarantee that their invariants are preserved.p      p[4] Teamwork. Once youve rigorously defined interfaces between modules,    each programmer can independently implement a module without having    access to the other modules. A large, complex programming project can    be broken up into dozens of pieces.p      p[5] Documentation and maintainability. By defining an unambiguous    interface, you make it easier for other programmers to fix bugs that    arise years after youve left the company. Many bugs are a result of    unforeseen interactions between modules. If theres a clear    specification of each interface and each modules behavior, bugs are    easier to trace.p      p[6] When your Project doesnt work, it will be easier to figure out which    teammate to blame.p blockquote  pQuestion 1p  pWrt emPoint1emabove says, emA new, better implementation can replace an old one.em. This is the goal of emabstractionem but not emencapsulationem. Am I correctp  pQuestion 2p  pWrt emPoint 4emabove, How emEncapsulationem help programmer to independently implement module without having access to other modules How does parallel implementation of modules has anything to do with emEncapsulationem Because Encapsulation is about protecting eminvariantsem.

Negative 78331 pI set the button according to the 113 numbers on game card. When I click on a button I want it to randomly draw a card from the deck. If the card doesnt match the button  then I can try another button, if the card match the button  then the game ends. The program will keep running through 52 cards as long as the button and the card doesnt match. lblpic is where the card image suppose to appear when the user click one of the number button. I cant get the buttons to work properly. I fixed some codes in my Card game, but its still not working. I also cant get the card image to show up when the user click on a number button. I tried linking the ImageLoader class to the CardGame Jframe, but its not wokring.p  pImageLoaderp  precode    import javax.swing.ImageIcon     public class ImageLoader          public final ImageIcon BACK   new ImageIconimgbackbluepattern.gif         public ImageIcon[][] cardImg  new ImageIcon[4][13]         public final String[] SUITS  clubs, hearts, spades, diamonds          public ImageLoader              for int i  0 i lt 4 i                  for int j  1 j lt 13 j                      String strBuf  img   SUITS[i]  j  .gif                     cardImg[i][j1]  new ImageIconstrBuf                                               Card          public class Card          Numerical equivalent of the suit and face         private int suitNum  valid range is 0  3         private int faceNum  valid range is 0  12         For converting between names and numbers         public static final String[] SUITS  Clubs, Hearts, Spades, Diamonds         public static final String[] FACES  Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six,              Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King          Constructor takes combined number and splits it to suit and face numbers         public Cardint num              if num gt 51                  System.out.printlnInput number is larger than 51.

Id like to do this in a unit test as opposed to an e2e test, if possible.  p  pI think that I should be able to do this without having to even use the uirouter API.  Ideally, Id like to fetch the template from the templatecache, then compile it, assigning the same controller as is registered with that state.p  pMy problem is that unless I missed something I cant find anything in the Angular API that will give me a way to programmatically compiling a template and assigning a controller at runtime.  compile accepts an HTML template string as its argument, then returns a function that accepts a scope as its argument. There is no place to bind it to a controller.p  pAs far as I can tell, I  have to either wrap my template in ... before I compile it, or create a directive that combines that template and controller and then compile  to get the result I want to examine.p  pIf anyone knows a better way to do this please let me know.p
Negative 78331 pIve already rubber duck tested this a couple of times, and Im still coming up blank. p  pEDIT Posted the wrong chunks of code in there. Have now updated with the correct code and analysis of what Im seeing. Feeling real smart right now. Thanks, max, for helping me out.p  pI refactored a view at the same time as I implemented a new feature, and for some reason, when I start the server and run the test manually, it works just fine, but when I run the automated tests, it fails. I cant figure out why, and Google or SO isnt bringing up anything helpful on the topic.p  pHeres what Im getting when I run rake testp  precodeERROR[testprofiledisplaybutnotskills, UsersProfileTest, 20150803 011605 0000]                                                                                    testprofiledisplaybutnotskillsUsersProfileTest 1438564565.47s                                                                                                      ActionViewTemplateError         ActionViewTemplateError undefined method name for nilNilClass                                                                              appviewsshareduserinfo.html.erb3in appviewsshareduserinfohtmlerb226220105685099717470092126401660                                                       appviewsusersshow.html.erb3in appviewsusersshowhtmlerb309894470137846538170092126356440                                                                     testintegrationusersprofiletest.rb11in block in ltclassUsersProfileTestgt                                                                                        appviewsshareduserinfo.html.erb3in appviewsshareduserinfohtmlerb226220105685099717470092126401660                                                       appviewsusersshow.html.erb3in appviewsusersshowhtmlerb309894470137846538170092126356440                                                                     testintegrationusersprofiletest.rb11in block in ltclassUsersProfileTestgt                                                                                     ERROR[testprofiledisplayskills, UsersProfileTest, 20150803 011605 0000]                                                                                            testprofiledisplayskillsUsersProfileTest 1438564565.48s                                                                                                              ActionViewTemplateError         ActionViewTemplateError undefined method name for nilNilClass                                                                              appviewsshareduserinfo.html.erb3in appviewsshareduserinfohtmlerb226220105685099717470092126401660                                                       appviewsusersshow.html.erb3in appviewsusersshowhtmlerb309894470137846538170092126356440                                                                     testintegrationusersprofiletest.rb19in block in ltclassUsersProfileTestgt                                                                                        appviewsshareduserinfo.html.erb3in appviewsshareduserinfohtmlerb226220105685099717470092126401660                                                       appviewsusersshow.html.erb3in appviewsusersshowhtmlerb309894470137846538170092126356440                                                                     testintegrationusersprofiletest.rb19in block in ltclassUsersProfileTestgt   codepre  pIve seen this one enough times now to know that its trying to call the name method on an object in a class that is nil, and its often because Rails is trying to call something on an object that isnt defined yet. I thought it might have something to do with the new partial shareduserinfo.html.erb that I added to my userpath usersshow view as part of my refactoring, which I had a little trouble getting to work at first. But a the partial loads before the page does when I look at what the server spits out in the terminal, and b I didnt even seemingly make updates to that piece of functionality, which is the header partial shared by the application. Also, the partial renders just fine on the other page that its used on the home page for the application and all tests for that page pass, so I dont think its the partial thats causing the issue.p  pHeres the integration test that keeps failing testintegrationusersprofiletest.rbp  precodetest profile display but not skills do     get userpathuser  fail     asserttemplate usersshow     assertselect title, fulltitleuser.name     assertselect h1, text user.name     assertselect h1, text user.derbyname end  test profile display skills do     get userpathuser  fail     assertmatch user.skills.count.tos, response.body     user.skills.each do skill         assertmatch skill.name, response.body         assertmatch skill.level.tos, response.body         assertmatch skill.comments, response.body     end end codepre  pIn both cases, the failure happens as soon as get userpathuser is called. I have no idea why this particular integration test cant call userpath on the fixture I have set for user none of my other integration tests are having issues. Im not sure if its quite the same as a GET request as far as testing goes, but Im able to do a PATCH request on userpathuser in another integration test testintegrationusersedittest.rbp  precodetest successful edit do     get edituserpathuser pass     loginasuser pass     patch userpathuser, user  name Foo Bar, derbyname Bar Foo, email foobar.com  pass     assertredirectedto user pass end codepre  pHeres the partial thats causing the issues I think appviewsshareduserinfo.html.erbp  precodeltaside classcolmd3gt     ltsection classuserinfogt         lth1gtlt currentuser.name gtlth1gt         lth1gtlt currentuser.derbyname gtlth1gt         lth2gtLeague Affiliation [to be developed]lth2gt         lth2gt[User type will display skater, ref, andor NSO]lth2gt         ltspangtlt linkto View my profile, currentuser gtltspangt         ltspangtlt pluralizecurrentuser.skills.count, skill gtltspangt     ltsectiongt ltasidegt codepre  pThis partial is used by the home page appviewsstaticpageshome.html.erb and the user profile page appviewsusersshow.html.erb.

Negative 78331 pI know about session and using it well. I know to use the session I should put the codesessionstartcode top of each page that I want to use the codesessioncode. But I found a problem in understanding of an issue. p  pConsider we have a bank that it called codeAcode bank and I want use from its payment gateway.Also consider we have a user that its username is codeBcode and heshe want to buy a product form the store.p  pAt first, when the login operation is successfully, the codelogin.phpcode file will get the session from the user and  will save the codeusernamecode value in the codeSESSION[loginuser]code variable. p  pWe know that the  codeSESSION[loginuser]code variable is a global variable. This means that if the username is codeBcode and login operation is successful as the result the  codeSESSION[loginuser]code will get the codeBcode value and if we use the  codeSESSION[loginuser]code in each codephpcode file, the value in the codeSESSION[loginuser]code is codeBcode.p  pAnd then consider the user clicks the buy button and the store redirects the user to the payment gateway and heshe can buy a product successfully.Now the payment gateway sends information about payment to the server. Now the big problem is that in here, the user does not send a request to get the hisher session. In here, the payment gateway from the codeAcode bank requests and sends information to the store.p  pNow I want to save the username that has purchased in the database.  I do not know What do I do. Since there is no a good tutorials about this issue, please guide me.p

Negative 78331 pI am having a very specific issue when trying to get a project deployed to Websphere that has multiple WARs packaged inside a single EAR. The first WAR is a SOAPbased web service while the second is a RESTbased service. Besides sharing a common build pom.xml neither of the two projects depend on each other.p  pThe problem I am running into is based on using the Jackson library in the REST service to handle JSON objects. For whatever reason the version of Jackson Websphere uses by default throws a codeNoSuchMethodcode error. This is apparently a common issue and switching the app to use a parentlast class loader solves it, afterwards the REST service works fine.p  pUnfortunately, the SOAP service does not work when using a parentlast class loader, throwing an error when trying to load one of the beans. Ive spent the last few days trying to get the two apps to play nice but havent succeeded yet.p  pAn ideal solution to the problem would be to get the REST service in general, and Jackson in particular, to work with a parentfirst class loader. A less ideal solution would be altering the SOAP service to work with a parentlast loader. Untenable solutions include splitting the apps into separate packages, or using something other than Jackson to handle the JSON objects.p  pDue to constraints at my company, I can only use versions of Jackson from 1.9.13 and below currently using 1.9.9, and Websphere Application Server v 8.0.0.8p

Negative 78331 pI need to be able to create an object from an array. The data is coming from a terrible API. Here is an example of the data.p  precodeArray  [0] gt stdClass Object              [no] gt 1         [FL] gt Array                              [0] gt stdClass Object                                              [content] gt 1505250000001141005                         [val] gt ACCOUNTID                                       [1] gt stdClass Object                                              [content] gt 1505250000000091001                         [val] gt SMOWNERID                                       [2] gt stdClass Object                                              [content] gt name here                         [val] gt Account Owner                      ETC... codepre  pThe [no] value is insignificant. the [FL] content is everything I need in the object. So the outcome I would like is all of the values will be variable names and content will be the values. Can anyone suggestion anything to help pleasep  pstrongemEDITemstrong I think I need to clarify what I need. Im creating a class called Account which will hold all the information from the api call in an object. I will instantiate the object then call a method for example valuesFromArray and pass it the [FL] array given by the api call. it will use [val] as the variable name and [content] as its value.p
