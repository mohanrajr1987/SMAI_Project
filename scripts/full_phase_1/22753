Positive 22753 pI am currently having a problem. I was attempting to clean up my storyboard which became far too large.  I have been attempting to do this by modifying the UITabBar controller I previously set up using the interface.  Now Im attempting to alter the buttons on the tabbar so that when clicked they each go to separate storyboards where those views are now located essentially recreating the individual tab items.p  pThe problem is, though, that now the separated ones do not display their navigation item which was present before and I was wondering if anyone knows how to do this  Ive found many resources but so far no success, currently I have the navigation item visible in the interface by setting the top bar section to a translucent navigation bar which displays the navigation item in the interface but does nothing to display it on build.p  precode    let eventStoryBoard  UIStoryboardnameScheduleStoryboard, bundle nil      var eventListViewController  self.storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierEventListViewController as UIViewController      let icon1  UITabBarItemtitle Schedule, image UIImagenamed appicoschedule, selectedImage UIImagenamed appicoschedule      eventListViewController.tabBarItem  icon1      var createAlbumController  self.storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierPhotoAlbumListViewController as UIViewController      let icon2  UITabBarItemtitle Albums, image UIImagenamed appicophotos, selectedImage UIImagenamed appicophotos      createAlbumController.tabBarItem  icon2      var views  self.viewControllers      views.removeAtIndex1      views.insertcreateAlbumController, atIndex 1      views.removeAtIndex0      views.inserteventListViewController, atIndex 0      self.viewControllers  nil     self.setViewControllersviews, animated false codepre  pCurrently Im doing this modifying the values of the individual items and setting them to views on separate storyboards.p

Earlier, I also tried initializing a scroll view separately but understand that table view is a subclass of scroll view, so ditched that path... p  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]       To remove extra separators from the table view to prevent blank rows from showing.     self.tableView.tableFooterView  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectZero]        Scroll view implementation      [[self tableView] setFrameCGRectMake0, self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame.size.height, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height  self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame.size.height  self.tabBarController.tabBar.frame.size.height]     [[self tableView] setContentSizeCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, 2000]      [self setEdgesForExtendedLayoutUIRectEdgeNone]     self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets  YES  codepre  pIn fact, to test this further, I have created a scroll view in a separate tab in this tabbarcontroller app where I only have a navigation bar and a tab bar so far no table view. Its viewDidLoad looks like this  somehow, no luck there as well... the scroll bar starts from the top of the screen rather than from the bottom of the navigation bar and goes till the bottom of the screen rather than till the top of the tab bar. So clearly Im doing something conceptually wrong here... appreciate if you can help out please The numbers put in here are experimental to test this out but Ive ensured that the content size is larger than the scroll view frame...p  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      UIScrollView scrollView  [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, 100, self.view.frame.size.width, 300]      [scrollView setContentSizeCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, 1500]     [self.view addSubviewscrollView]      [self setEdgesForExtendedLayoutUIRectEdgeNone]     self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets  NO     [scrollView setScrollEnabledYES]  codepre  pFinally, when I debug my app in the simulator, what is odd is that for the table view tab, the scroll bar does appear momentarily to start from below the navigation bar. But as soon as I touch the track pad to scroll, it disappears and a more prominent scroll bar appears and starts from the top of screen to the bottom of the screen as I mention initially abovep

Positive 22753 pI am experiencing an issue with UITabBarController when using iPad split view. When the iPad is in landscape and the app is in the 7030 split view with another app there are 8 tab items shown. 7 tab bar items I provided and the automatically generated more tab. p  pIf I select say the 6th item and change the split view to the 5050 view, the tab bar automatically reduced the number of visible tabs down to 5 tab items. The tab I previously selected6th tab changes into the more tab and the selected tabs view updates to the correct size. The issue ensues when I then change back to the 7030 split view. The correct tab is selected6th tab, but the view goes blank. I checked the view hierarchy and it is no where to be found. p  pOne weird thing is if I select the more tab the contents of the 6th tab is shown. Again, selecting the 6th tab shows the blank screen.p  pHas anyone ran across this or have any suggestion to try I am programmatically creating the tab bar if that makes a difference.p

Positive 22753 pI have a window with a UITabBarController as rootViewController.

When I show MyDetailViewController on the UISplitViewController while it is collapsed, I would expect the same, since the collapsed UISplitViewController contains only a UINavigationController with the Master which pushes the Detail ViewController.

Please please please do not tell me I shouldnt do it this way. Thats just another way to say I dont feel like helping you figure this out.p  pIve tried looking for clean, simple, elegant solutions.  I havent found any.  A complete example would be appreciated.  Thanks p

Negative 22753 pI am writing an application to test a network driver for handling corrupted data. And I thought of sending this data using raw socket, so it will not be corrected by the sending machines TCPIP stack.p  pI am writing this application solely on Linux. I have code examples of using raw sockets in systemcalls, but I would really like to keep my test as dynamic as possible, and write most if not all of it in Python.p  pI have googled the web a bit for explanations and examples of the usage of raw sockets in python, but havent found anything really enlightening. Just a a very old code example that demonstrates the idea, but in no means work.p  pFrom what I gathered, Raw Socket usage in Python is nearly identical in semantics to UNIXs raw socket, but without the codestructcodes that define the packets structure.p  pstrongI was wondering if it would even be better not to write the raw socket part of the test in Python, but in C with systemcalls, and call it from the main Python codestrongp

Negative 22753 pI am having problems with WSS 3.0 Workflow using joined lists. Here is the descriptionp  pI am creating a simple workholiday requestbooking app. This is just for internal department use so that staff can book annual leave and have it authorised by their respective manager.p  pTo that end, I have two lists The first list is called Staff and contains the persons name, email address, and manager name. The manager name is populated by a dropdown on the same list.p  pThe second list is called HolidayRequest and has fields for name a dropdown based on the staff list, start date and end date.p  pWhen ever a new entry is made to the HolidayRequest list I want to trigger a workflow that will send an email to that persons manager to notify them for approval. The problem I have is getting the managers name and email address into workflow. The problem as I see it is that this information is obtained through a joined listp  precode       HolidayRequest                          Staff StartDate, EndDate, Name  gt   Name, EmailAddress, Manager                                                                                                                                                                                               codepre  pSo what I need is for the workflow to use the Name field from HolidayRequest, to locate the record for the same name in the Staff list, and then get the managers name from that record, get the manager staff record and thereby the managers email address. Its not exactly rocketscience, but I just cant figure it out in workflow using Sharepoint Designer.p  pI guess the first question is whether workflow is the correct tool for this, and secondly if it is, then is there a way I can achieve what I needp  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 22753 pIm having some trouble with a recursive relationship in core data.  Ive got a managed object called a SearchCategory, and that category can have Categories and it can also have a Category.  In the managed object modeler, Ive got two relationships set up on the SearchCategory entity, and both point back to the SearchCategory entity  one is named Categories and is a tomany relationship.  The other is Category, is not a tomany, and is the inverse of Categories.p  pIn my code Im using setCategoriesObject to add categories to a searchcategory, which seems to be working.  However, when I say code[mySearchCategory setCategoryaParentCategory]code, where codemySearchCategorycode would be a child category of codeaParentCategorycode, it doesnt seem to want take in memory.  If I run the above code, then code[managedobjectcontext saveamperr]code, it actually saves the primary key of the parent category to the Category field of the child category in the database, but Core Data doesnt synthesize this relationship at run time, so code[mySearchCategory Category]code returns nil.

Negative 22753 pI have to go through a database and modify it  according to a logic. The problem looks something like this. I have a history table in my database and I have to modify.  Before modifying anything I have to look at whether an object which has several rows in the history table had a certain state, say 4 or 9. If it had state 4 or 9 then I have to check the rows between the currently found row and the next state 4 or 9 row. If such a row between those states has a specific value in a specific column then I do something in the next row. I hope this is simple enough to give you an idea. I have to do this check for all the objects.

Negative 22753 pThis is mostly a philosophical question about the best way to interpret the HTTP spec. Should a directory with no directory index e.g. index.html return 404 or 403 403 is the default in Apache.p  pFor example, suppose the following URLs exist and are accessiblep  precodehttpexample.comfilesfile1 httpexample.comfilesfile2 codepre  pBut theres nothing atp  precodehttpexample.comfiles codepre  pAssume were using 301s to force trailing slashes for all URLs.p  pI think several things should be taken into accountp  ul liBy default, Apache returns 403 in this scenario. Thats significant to me. Theyve thought about this stuff, and they made the decision to use 403.li liAccording to W3C, 403 means The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. I take that to mean you should return 403 if the URL is meaningful but nonetheless forbidden.li li403 might result in information disclosure if the client correctly guesses that the URL maps to a real directory on disk.li licodehttpexample.comfilescode isnt a resource, and the fact that it internally maps to a directory shouldnt be relevant to the status code.li liIf you interpret the URL scheme as defining a directory structure emfrom the clients perspectiveem, the internal implementation is still irrelevant, but perhaps the outward appearance should indeed have some bearing on the status codes. Maybe, even if you created the same URL structure without using directories internally, you should still use 403s, because its about the clients perception of a directory structure.li ul  pIn the balance, what do you think is the best approach Should we just say a resource is a resource, and if it doesnt exist, its a 404 Or should we say, if it has slashes, it looks like a directory to the client, and therefore its a 403 if theres no indexp  pIf youre in the 403 camp, do you think you should go out of your way to return 403s even if the internal implementation doesnt use directories Suppose, for example, that you have a dynamic web app with this URL codehttpexample.comusersjoecode, which maps to some code that generates the profile page for Joe. Assuming you dont write something that lists all users, should codehttpexample.comuserscode return 403 Many if not all web frameworks return 404 in this case.p

Negative 22753 pThis one really has me stumped.  Im working with another developer who called me because he couldnt believe what he was seeing.  We stepped through with the debugger together and I saw it too and had no explanation.  Heres the scenario.  He is writing a method that interacts with a 3rd party COM object through an autogenerated COM wrapper generated simply by adding the COM component as a reference.  Heres the top of his methodp  precode  public bool RefolderDocumentref IManDocument oDoc              string strCustom1  string oDoc.GetAttributeValueByIDimProfileAttributeID.imProfileCustom1         string strCustom2  string oDoc.GetAttributeValueByIDimProfileAttributeID.imProfileCustom2 codepre  pThe purpose of the code is to get a project number and subproject number from a document object oDoc.  p  pHeres what happens as you step through.  After the first assignment strCustom1 has the expected value 32344 a project number and strCustom2 is empty as expected.  After the second assignment, strCustom2 gets the subproject number 0002  strongbut strCustom1 has been changed to 32334strong  one character has been changedp  pIt struck me as some kind of oldschool clanguage stackoverrun which I wouldnt expect in a managed application even if it was interoperating with a COM component.

One perhaps relevant point is that this is a service and we are attaching to the service process.

Negative 22753 pWhat is the simplest way to get raw access to HID devices on OS Xp  pIve been looking through the IOKit examples, but even opening a device seems needlessly complex, involving multiple callbacks and include things from half a dozen libraries.br libusb is available for OS X, but the kernel grabs all HID devices for exclusive access, and I have been getting strange behavior while trying to use a codeless .kext to block it from associating with my device it prevents the kernel from grabbing the device initially, but any calls to configure the device seem to cause the kernel to grab the device away from under the little python libusb script I am testing with.p  pBasically, I have a HID device that just streams data. I want to open it for ideally exclusive access, and just get the datastream.p  pAll the examples I have found in the IOKit docs are really complex, compared to the 8 lines it would take in libusb. There must be a simpler way that isnt a 3rd party library.p  psupIts worth noting that I am entirely unfamiliar with programming for OS X in any capability.supp  psupPython support would be a nice plussupp

We use WCF to communicate with them and control them, since WCF offers very convenient communication with these processes.p  pRight now in our Windows GUI for managing, monitoring and troubleshooting the services, we simply register callbacks and receive notifications when a message is available from the service.  Obviously this application is stateful and WCF provides the ability for the local delegate to be called when the maintained connection to the service indicates.p  pIn our web application which users actually use, wed like to use longpolling to have a status area on the web page iframe, AJAX, whatever which shows any issues which the services are reporting.  Wed like to use a longpolling or other technique which minimizes actual polling on the network.p  pThe problem we are running up against is that we need something to make the longpolling HTTP request against which will somehow always be running in IIS and which itself can be WCFconnected to our services and which can convert the eventdelegatebased WCF response into a blockingstyle longpoll response.  It feels like a chickenandegg situation that some component in our system is always going to be in a loop, polling  and thats exactly what we are trying to avoid.p  pDoes anyone have an example of doing thisp

Negative 22753 pIm looking at Chris Coyiers tutorial for creating dynamic Next and Previous buttons for Jquery UI tabs. The buttons showhide themselves according to if they are pointing at the first or last tab. It works perfectly on his example, which is from 2009. Fastforward to 2011, the navs unfortunately does not work with new versions of jquery specifically, jquery1.6.4.p  pFor reference, the original tutorial a hrefhttpcsstricks.com2361jqueryuitabswithnextprevious relnofollowhttpcsstricks.com2361jqueryuitabswithnextpreviousap  pThe Coyier script correctly appends the Next  Previous buttons into the uitabspanel. However, the links either 1 do not click through to anything, 2 the first Next link goes right to the last tab, and the Previous link does not work, or 3 the Next  Previous links go only to the first and last tabs, skipping everything in between. p  pWhat I need is a way show and hide the next or previous buttons, depending on whether a viewer is looking at the first or last tab. p  pThe code I have so far is...p  precodej  jQuery.noConflict jfunction       var jQuerytabs  jtabs.tabs     j.eventsnavnext, .eventsnavprev.hide      j.uitabspanel.eachfunctioni          var totalSize  j.uitabspanel.size  1          if i  totalSize          next  i  2             j.eventsnavnext.show                  if i  0          prev  i             j.eventsnavprev.show                   j.eventsnavnext.clickfunction          var tabs  jtabs.tabs         var selected  tabs.tabsoption, selected         tabs.tabsselect, selected1         return false          j.eventsnavprev.clickfunction          var tabs  jtabs.tabs         var selected  tabs.tabsoption, selected         tabs.tabsselect, selected1         return false        codepre  pThe buttons work perfectly to navigate through my tabs. BUT, Im in desperate need to properly show and hide the first and last buttons. p  pIve tried using the jquerycustom script that Coyier used, which still did not work. Thus I assume its the modern version of Jquery thats causing the problems with the original tutorial. Im also a jquery newb. Any protips or pointers are most appreciated. Thank youp  pNotes These tabs are being used in a passwordprotected dev environment, so Im unable to provide the working example. In this instance the jQuery.noConflict mode is required and cant be removed.p

Negative 22753 pMy project is a codejavacode project over codeEJB3code using Hibernate and codeWeblogiccode server. p  pFor convenience sake and as far as I understand, is typical to codehibernatecode, some of the entities contains circular dependency Parent knows the child, child know the parent. Further, for some of the child classes  the codehashCodecode and codeequalscode method depend on their parent As it is a unique key.p  pWhen working I saw an odd behavior  Some of the Sets that returned from the server to the client, although containing the right elements, acted like they contained none. For example, a simple test such as this codeset.containsset.toArray[0]code returned codefalsecode although the codehashCodecode method is a good one. p  pAfter extensive debugging I was able to produce 2 simple classes that reproduce the problem I can assure you the codehashCodecode function in both classes is strongreflexive, transitive and symmetricalstrongp  precodepackage test  import

It starts serializing the Set before the String, and thus causing the above problem.p  pWhat should I do in this situation Is there any option aside from implementing codereadResolvecode for many entities... to direct java to serialize a class in a certain order Also, is it fundamentally wrong for an entity to base its codehashCodecode on its parentp  pstrongEditstrong A solution was suggested by a colleague  Because Im using Hibernate, every entity has a unique long ID. I know that Hibernate specify not to use this ID in the equals method  but what about hashCode Using this unique ID as hashcode seems to solve the above problem with a minimal risk of performance issues. Are there any other implications to using the ID as hashcodep  pstrongSECOND EDITstrong I went and implemented my partial solution All of the enteties now use the ID field for the hashCode function and no longer relay on other enteties for it but, alas, Serialization bugs still continue to plague me Below is a sample code with another serialization bug. What I think is happening is this  ClassA start deserializing, sees it has a ClassB to deserialize and BEFORE it deserializes its ID, it start deserializing the ClassB. B start to deserialize and Sees it has a Set of ClassA. The ClassA instance is partialy deserialized, but even though ClassB adds it to the Set using the missing ID of ClassA, completes the deserializning, ClassA then completes and the bug occurs.p  pWhat can I do to solve this Circular dependencies is a very used practice in Hibernate and I just cant accept it that im the only one with this problem.p  pAnother possible solution is to have a dedicated variable for the hashCode will be calculated by the objects ID and make sure view readObject and writeObject that it will be read BEFORE VERY OTHER OBJECT. What do you think Are there any disadvantages to this solutionp  pThe sample codep  precodeimport java.io.File import java.io.FileInputStream import java.io.FileOutputStream import java.io.ObjectInputStream import java.io.ObjectOutputStream import java.io.Serializable import java.util.HashSet import java.util.Set  public class Test implements Serializable      public static void mainString[] args throws Exception              ClassA aClass  new ClassA         aClass.setIdLong.valueOf321          ClassB bClass  new ClassB         bClass.setIdLong.valueOf921          SetltClassAgt set  new HashSetltClassAgt         set.addaClass          bClass.setSetfieldset         aClass.setBFieldbClass          SetltClassAgt goodClassA  aClass.getBField.getSetfield         SetltClassAgt badClassA  serializeAndDeserializeaClass.getBField.getSetfield          System.out.printlnDoes it contain its member should return true   goodClassA.containsgoodClassA.toArray[0]         System.out.printlnDoes it contain its member should return true   badClassA.containsbadClassA.toArray[0]           public static ClassA serializeAndDeserializeClassA s throws Exception              new ObjectOutputStreamnew FileOutputStreamnew Filetemp.writeObjects         return ClassA new ObjectInputStreamnew FileInputStreamnew Filetemp.readObject           public static class ClassB implements Serializable              private Long mId         private SetltClassAgt mSetfield  new HashSetltClassAgt         public Long getmId              return mId                  public void setIdLong mId              this.mId  mId                  public SetltClassAgt getSetfield              return mSetfield                  public void setSetfieldSetltClassAgt mSetfield              this.mSetfield  mSetfield                  Override         public int hashCode              final int prime  31             int result  1             result  prime  result  mId  null  0  mId.hashCode             return result                  Override         public boolean equalsObject obj              if this  obj                 return true             if obj  null                 return false             if getClass  obj.getClass                 return false             ClassB other  ClassB obj             if mId  null                  if other.mId  null                     return false              else if mId.equalsother.mId                 return false             return true                           public static class ClassA implements Serializable              private Long mId         private ClassB mBField         public Long getmId              return mId                  public void setIdLong mId              this.mId  mId                  public ClassB getBField              return mBField                  public void setBFieldClassB mBField              this.mBField  mBField                  Override         public int hashCode              final int prime  31             int result  1             result  prime  result  mId  null  0  mId.hashCode             return result                  Override         public boolean equalsObject obj              if this  obj                 return true             if obj  null                 return false             if getClass  obj.getClass                 return false             ClassA other  ClassA obj             if mId  null                  if other.mId  null                     return false              else if mId.equalsother.mId                 return false             return true                codepre

Negative 22753 pIt looks a very simple question. There are many lines available as their two endpoints. The question is stronghow to discretize them into a matrixstrong. Then the matrix can be used for image processing purposes. At the following figure example lines yellow and their corresponding pixelated demonstrations are shown. A piece of code in any language would be of great help and strongly recommended and of course is in advance appreciated. Note that performance and accuracy are very important factors.br Also as demonstrated each point of line must have only one pixel i.e., element of matrix associated.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVvQOe.png altenter image description herep

Negative 22753 pI have built out a couple of keyboards for a touch aware app we are building in work. Since we use a controller that is aware of when the app is in touch screen mode I thought it would be nice if, in design mode, we could associate a control with a keyboard type and have the controller look after the calling of the keyboard.p  pOne of the things I do not want to do is to sub class each type of control just to add this property as I feel it is a very heavy for small gain. I had thought of using the tag property but it is not available in all controls due to use.p  pI was wondering if there is a way of attaching a property to a control on design time for the purpose of adding this meta data. So to recap I would like to be able to give each control a value that would be read by the controller to decide what keyboard to show. p

Negative 22753 pIve read up on SQL Injection, XSS and other security issues and am trying to figure out what to use to safeguard the companys site.p  pWe are about to deploy a simple User feedback form with a textarea so users can tell us how to improve the site to enhance their user experience.  p  pWhen the user pushes submit on the form, we read the textarea comments from the user, and then programmatically create a filename in that users subfolder and save their comments to a file.  Then we add the filename and path to that users database record.p  pThe team is not worried about security issues here but I am.  Their thinking is we create the filename, it is 0 based on any user input, and since we write this UserX comments filename and path to the database with no direct user influence  there is no risk.p  pMy concern is NOT the database activity  because theyre right, the user has no role in WHAT we write to their database record since were just creating our own filename and storing it in their db record.p  pMy concern is the text filep  pSo Im petitioning our small team to rewrite the code to use security to read then write the users comments in the textarea to the text file.p  pMy concern is  since we plan to actually READ our users feedback and open these text files to read them later on  there might be bad stuff in the textarea that unless we clean it could hurt us somehow.p  pIm insisting we use striptags but I need to sound informed about the manner in which we sanitize the textarea input  Im thinking striptags is the way to go here but Im 100 new to sanitizing user input.  I looked at htmlspecialchars but that just converts certain characters like amp to amp and so forth.p  pAre there other ways to santizemake safe any text the user types into a textarea before we write it out to a file on our web serverp

However, this compiles and runs, but doesnt seem to be what I wantp  precodeMyBigData  mbd  MyBigData  malloc sizeofmyBigData  mbdgtdataArray  float  cudaMalloc 10  sizeoffloat  codepre  pBecause now, although this is valid, now mbd resides on the main system memory, and the float pointer points to memory allocated on the CUDA device.  So I cant just pass a pointer to the MyBigData structure, I have to pass each variable in the structure to the kernel individually.  Not clean.  What I want isp  precodesomeKernelltltlt1,1gtgtgtmbd codepre  pNotp  precodesomeKernelltltlt1,1gtgtgtmbdgtdataArray, mbdgttargetArray, mbdgtnodes, mbdgtdataDataData codepre  pSo I was thinking, how about cudaMemcpy  I was thinking of thisp  precodeMyBigData dmbd  cudaMemcpy void ampdmbd, void mbd, SOMESIZE, CudaHostToDevice codepre  pBut then what do I put for SOMESIZE I cant use sizeofMyBigData, because that will include the size of float pointers, not the actual size of the arrays.  Second, is cudaMemcpy even smart enough to dig down into subobjects of a complicated data structure I think not.p  pSo, is it impossible to have a structure containing dynamic memory on the CUDA card Or am I missing something.  The easy way would be to have a CUDA kernel allocate some memory, but you cant call cudaMalloc from a CUDA kernel.p  pThoughtsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong 7 May I wrote this code, and it compiles, but it tells me all the values are zero.  I think I am creating the object correctly and populating the values properly with the CUDA Kernel.  The values are just the thread ID.  I suspect Im not printing the values properly.

Negative 22753 pI just noticed that moving the mouse cursor across a tooltip does not seem to return a mouseMoveEvent in PySide.p  pIn my case it causes trouble as I am dynamically displaying a miniicon on top of a main icon when the mouse moves over the main icon area, and hiding the miniicon again when the mouse leaves the main icon area. So if the user moves the mouse cursor across a large tooltip and then ends up outside the main button area, the mouse event never registered the new position and the miniicon stays visible, even though the mouse is no longer over the main icon area.p  pI guess I could work around this problem by creating a custom QToolTip and positioning it away from the main button area, so its never possible to leave the main button area via the tooltip.

Negative 22753 pIm trying to set up an initial view for my application introduction page and after the user confirms this page from henceforth display a tabbed view by default.

Negative 22753 pI need to have a button that takes the information that you have entered into one div, and put it into another. Basically I have one div that asks for delivery information, while the other asks for billing info. I want to have a button you can press that if you have filled out the delivery info then pressing the button would make the information entered into the delivery information transfer to the billing info. How would i make a button do thatp

Negative 22753 pI dont know why Im just now noticing this behavior for the first time. Looking to confirm whether this is designed behavior, or whether Im missing something.p  pSay I have a viewmodel that implements codeIEnumerableltTgtcode, and provides additional properties. For examplep  precodepublic class MyResultsViewModel  IEnumerableltMyResultViewModelgt      public IEnumerableltMyResultViewModelgt Results  get set      public string SomeAdditionalProperty  get set       public IEnumeratorltMyResultViewModelgt GetEnumerator              return Results.GetEnumerator          IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator  return GetEnumerator   codepre  pSay I also have a controller which returns this model as json. For examplep  precodepublic ActionResult MyResults      var entities  PrivateMethodToGetEntities     var models  Mapper.MapltMyResultsViewModelgtentities     models.SomeAdditionalProperty  I want this in the JSON too     return Jsonmodels, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet      models now contains a populated Results as well as the addl string prop  codepre  pWhen I get the results back from a JSON request on the client, it always comes back as an array. For examplep  precode.getPathToMyResults .successfunction results      alertresults.SomeAdditionalProperty  this alerts undefined     alertresults.length  this alerts the size  count of Results     alertresults[0]  this alerts object      inspecting results here shows that it is a pure array, with no addl props  codepre  pBefore I refactor to make the viewmodel not implement codeIEnumerableltTgtcode, I want to get some confirmation that this is by design and should be expected. I guess it makes sense, since the javascript array objects prototype would have to be extended to accommodate the additional properties.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIve made the following changes to the viewmodel, to avoid naming the internal enumerable codeResultscodep  precodepublic class MyResultsViewModel  IEnumerableltMyResultViewModelgt      public IEnumerableltMyResultViewModelgt NotNamedResults  get set      public string SomeAdditionalProperty  get set       public IEnumeratorltMyResultViewModelgt GetEnumerator              return NotNamedResults.GetEnumerator          IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator  return GetEnumerator   codepre  pWith this change, the behavior remains. codealertJSON.stringifyresultscode yields normal array syntax for my enumerated collection of codeMyResultViewModelcodesp  blockquote   p[ResultProp1A,ResultProp2AA,ResultProp3AAA,ResultProp1B,ResultProp2BB,ResultProp3BBB,ResultProp1C,ResultProp2CC,ResultProp3CCC,ResultProp1D,ResultProp2DD,ResultProp3DDD,ResultProp1E,ResultProp2EE,ResultProp3EEE]p blockquote  pIs still seems that the additional property is being lost between when the controller action returns the codeJsonResultcode and the jquery codesuccesscode function is invoked.p

Negative 22753 pIm very new to programing. Im using Visual Basic 2010. I have an Access data source named CoreDataSet, it has three tables Rates, Vendors, Zones. I have binded the Vendors table to two Combo boxes, when a Vendors Name is selected the first three digits of their zip code appears in a label next to the coresponding combo box. I want to take these two labels or the two 3 digit zipcodes and cross reference to the Zones table. The zones table has a list of three digit zip across the top column names and three digit zipes in the second column and looks like the following examplep  precodeID ZIP  020      021    022 ...  1  020  ZONE 1  ZONE 2  ZONE 3 ... 2  021  ZONE 2  ZONE 1  ZONE 3 ... 3  022  ZONE 3  ZONE 2  ZONE 1 ... codepre  pSo shipping from zipcode 022 to 021 would be ZONE 3, and 022 to 022 would Zone 1. The goal is to select two Vendors one in each combo box and the form display in a label 1 and 2 their 3 digit zips done and the UPS zones applicable to them in label 3 not done. Is cross referencing even possible Please help, Thanks.p  pThank You for your help. I got half of it to work.

Negative 22753 pIs it acceptable practice to install an Authenticode code signing certificate directly on a build server to create a production signed build  Im looking for some resources on the net that suggest or support that this practice is legitimate providing youve taken appropriate steps to secure the build server and the process by which a build is created and deployed.p  pAll the best practice guidance I can find about code signing practices are way over the top in terms of suggested process.  Microsofts reference document has as many as 6 servers in play for the simple act of signing a single assembly.  a hrefhttpdownload.microsoft.comdownloadaf7af7777e57dcd48008a0ab18336565f5bbestpractices.doc relnofollowhttpdownload.microsoft.comdownloadaf7af7777e57dcd48008a0ab18336565f5bbestpractices.doca  p  h1Some backgroundh1  pMy company creates simple richclient line of business applications for its employees and direct customers.  We do not create commercial software.  My build server is physically secured and network secured using my companies strict security policies and procedures.  Only very specific people in the organization have the ability to even start a build in my environment.p  pOur current process requires me to break a builddeploy process into many stages with stronga lotstrong of manual process in place.  We use physical devices to store the Authenticode certificates, requiring userentered PINs to access.  We have to shuffle the assembliesmanifests that require code signing to designated code signing PCs which also have to be physically secured.  p  pTo me, it is less secure to pass around a physical tokendevice and leave all these manual steps in place.   There is nothing stopping a person with physical access to the tokendevice from signing anything they want.  At least, with an automated, logged, controlled build server environment, you know what was signed and by who.p
Negative 22753 pIve recently inherited a ASP.NET MVC 4 code base. One problem I noted was the use of some database ids ints in the urls as well in html form submissions. The code in its present state is exploitable through both URL tinkering and creating custom HTML posts with different numbers.p  pNow while I can easily fix the URL problems by using session state or additional auth checks im less sure about the database ids that get embedded into the HTML that the site spits out i.e. I give them a drop down to fill. When the ids come back in a post how can I be sure I put them there as valid options What is considered best practice in terms of addressing this problem p  pWhile I appreciate I could just GUID it up Im hesitant to do so because I find them a pain in the ass to work with when debugging databases. p  pDo I have a choice here Must I GUID to prevent easy guessing of ids or is there some kind of DRY mechanism I can use to validate the usage of ids as they come back into the sitep  pUPDATE A commenter asked about the exploits Im expecting. Lets say I spit out a HTML form with a drop down list of all the locations one can import treasure from. The id of the locations that the user owns are 1,2 and 3, these are provided in the HTML. But the user examines the html, fiddles with it and decides to put together a POST with the id of 4 selected. 4 is not his location, its someone elses.p

Negative 22753 pWhat isare the differences of Javas JAXWS and Metro Are they the same of are they two different JAXWS implementationsp  pAccording to my research, JAXWS is already a part of JDK 6.

However, it seems that Oracle does not host a compiled Java EE jar but instead provides Glassfish which is a Java EE server. p  pI was able to run my web service on Glassfish. What JAXWS implementation does Glassfish use Since its hosted on Oracle, Im assuming that it is using Javas implementation of JAXWS which is supposedly a part of JDK 1.6 Am I correct with my assumption Also, to run a JAXWS based web service, I need to download JAXWS jars. I found a hrefhttpjaxws.java.netMetroa. But on its page, I see the link of metro to be a sublink of Glassfish. So Im now confused. Is Glassfish using Metro Or is Glassfish using Javas JAXWS p  pAre Metro and Javas JAXWS the samep

Negative 22753 pI have a details view that I am using to fill a table with values.

However Im just not sure when to do that. Ive considered several options. p  ol lipIn the codeloadViewcode method. However, since Im loading my view using a XIB, I think i shouldnt mess with this method and should instead leave it asis. Am I correct on this point, BTW pli lipIn the codeviewWillAppearcode method. But this method may be called multiple times because the view may be moved out and into the screen without being destroyed and recreated. Am I correct  This will not do any harm to the program but sure doesnt seem like the correct way. pli lipIn the initializer of the UIViewController. If I want to add the notification there I must reference the UITextField. By doing this I essentially cause the view to created before it is really needed. Also I think I read somewhere that if the system runs low on memory the offscreen views may be destroyed. Thus I may lose the notification observing if such thing happens, right pli ol  pSo Im totally confused right now. Could you guys give me some advice of where to put it Thanks so much p

Negative 22753 pIm quite new to ObjectiveC and Im trying to write my first app for iOS. The idea is quite simple but I have failed already in the beginning architecture construction.p  pI would like to create different views displayed over several tabs, which should be created dynamically when the view is loaded. Additionally, the app must have the ability to add tabs dynamically at runtime. Tab views should not run over the entire screen but should fill 23 of the top view. The remaining 13 at the bottom is again divided into two subviews, which are not intended to be changed with tab switches.p  pWhat Ive done is to create a UIWindow, UITabBarController, and two UIViewControllers for two tabs and one or two as in the figure which is supposed to be at the bottom.p  pSo far Ive managed to switch between different tab views, but as soon as I try to resize UIViewControllers for both tabs with CGMakeRect to any size it always stays the same and covers the entire screen.p  pThe subview created at the bottom contains a button which is somehow not clickable. Maybe because its covered from the tab views.p  pCan anyone give me a little help how I can build up those viewsp  pThanks a lotp  pHere is be my codep  precodeself.window  [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]]   UIViewController test  [[UIViewController alloc] init] test.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor grayColor] test.view.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, 320, 200  UIButton button3  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeRoundedRect] [button3 setTitleView 3 forStateUIControlStateNormal] button3.frame  CGRectMake30.0, 30.0, 120.0, 50.0 [test.view addSubviewbutton3]   UITabBarController tabBarController  [[UITabBarController alloc] init]  UIViewController viewController1  [[UIViewController alloc] init] UITabBarItem tab1  [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTabBarSystemItemUITabBarSystemItemBookmarks tag1] [viewController1 setTabBarItemtab1]  UIViewController viewController2  [[UIViewController alloc] init] UITabBarItem tab2  [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTabBarSystemItemUITabBarSystemItemContacts tag2] [viewController2 setTabBarItemtab2]   UIButton button  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeRoundedRect] [button setTitleView from Tab 1 forStateUIControlStateNormal] button.frame  CGRectMake100.0, 100.0, 120.0, 50.0 [viewController1.view addSubviewbutton]  UIButton button2  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeRoundedRect] [button2 setTitleView from Tab 2 forStateUIControlStateNormal] button2.frame  CGRectMake100.0, 100.0, 120.0, 50.0 [viewController2.view addSubviewbutton2]   tabBarController.viewControllers  [NSArray arrayWithObjectsviewController1, viewController2, nil]  self.window.rootViewController  tabBarController [self.window addSubviewtest.view]  [self.window makeKeyAndVisible] codepre
Negative 22753 pI have a web application which allows SAML authentication by users using their own identity provider. I have fields in a database in my application which I want to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt and developersadministrators of the system are NOT implicitly authorized.

But how can this be done when there is no login password, because the user has been authenticated with SAMLp
Negative 22753 pI want to create a nuget package that will add a custom msbuild property before PostBuildEvent property because I need to use it inside post build event and after imports so that I can use TargetDir property without the user being asked to reload the solution.

Negative 22753 pi am curious if there is a way of monitoring the request duration time on an iis server. Personally I have came up with a solution but its really resource intensive and that is why im asking the question, just to gather more opinions. p  pMy plan is to extract the duration time of each request and send it to graphite so as to have a real time overview of the performance of the webserver. The idea ive came up with is to use poweshell with its webadministration module. And if you run  codegetitem IISAppPoolsDefaultAppPool  GetWebRequestcode for example you get all the requests on that app pool with a lot of info including the time info.p  pThe thing is that i should have a script which runs every 100 ms to get all requests and that is kinda wasteful. Is there a way to tell iis to put the request duration timein miliseconds in the logs Because then it would be much easier to get the information I need.p

Negative 22753 pI need to progam an Arduino for a project, and I thought Id add something fancy, a LED color changing thingy. The LED has a sort of cyclus in which it changes colors, which takes about 40 seconds to do so. Though, the bat sensor, that makes the LED burn, registers the whole time and tells the LED a couple of times a second to go on, again. The LED never gets the time to change color and only stays the first color.p  pI have no idea how to fix this. I was trying to give the LED a delay or something, but apparently I did that wrong.

Negative 22753 pIn my application, I have one single thread that is performing very fast processing on log lines to produce a float value. There is usually only a single other thread performing slow reads on the values at intervals. Every so often, other threads can come and go and also perform onceoff reads on those values.p  pMy question is about the necessity of a mutex in cpython, for this specific case where the data is simply the most recent data available. It is not a critical value that must be in sync with anything else or even the other fields being written at the same time. Just simply... what the value is when it is.p  pThat being said, I know I could easily add a lock or a readers  write lock to guard the update of the value, but I wonder if the overhead of the acquirerelease in rapid succession for the course of an entire log lets say average 5000 lines is not worth it just to do shared resources appropriately.p  pBased on the docs on a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2faqlibrarywhatkindsofglobalvaluemutationarethreadsafe relnofollowWhat kinds of global value mutation are threadsafea, these assignments should be atomic operations.p  pHere is a basic example of the logicp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeimport time from random import random, choice, randint from threading import Thread   class DataStructureobject     def initself         self.fval  0.0         self.sval    def slowreaderdata           Loop much more slowly and read values      anywhere between 1  5 second intervals          for  in xrange10          fval  data.fval           dont care about sync here         sval  data.sval          print fval, sval           in real code could be even 30 or 60 seconds         time.sleeprandint1,3  def fastwriterdata      Update data extremely often      for  in xrange20000         fval, sval  dowork          data.fval  fval          dont care about sync here         data.sval  sval    FLOATSRC  [random100 for  in xrange100] STRSRC  [foo, bar, biz, baz]  def dowork     time.sleep0.001     return choiceFLOATSRC, choiceSTRSRC   if name  main      data  DataStructure      threads  [         Threadtargetslowreader, argsdata,,         Threadtargetfastwriter, argsdata,,     ]      for t in threads         t.daemonTrue         t.start      for t in threads         t.join codepre  pThis represents the fast log parser actually being read via a PIPE doing work on each line, and a slow periodic reader grabbing whatever are the current values at that moment.

Negative 22753 pI have a pluggable app for Django that provides a few forms.

Negative 22753 pWe are dumping a lot of data in terms of volume than frequency i.e. dumping 100K or  400MB records at once  from database to Excel files. The dumping process is currently being performed in Python, R and Java using POI library. As part of the dump process, we read the data from the database to a intermediate file pipe delimited text file which is then picked up by the code to update excel files. Recently, we ran into issues where text from database with newline characters caused the pipe delimited files to be invalid since 1 record spanned over multiple lines as opposed to just one line. For example,p  precode Col1  Col2  Col3     Val   Val2  Val3  codepre  pis a valid example of pipe delimited file. If the data contains any new lines, thenp  precode Col1  Col2  Col3   Val1    Val2  Val3     codepre  pSuch scenarios become harder to catch and results in more coding then needs to be done in order to make such checks.p  pI was wondering if there are any librariestechniques that can be used to write out such temp data. I am not sure if XML would be a solution, considering that performance might become a issue for such a large volume of data. JSON might seem a better fit, but then I dont know all my options here. p

Negative 22753 pIm trying to implement a point cloud where the different points shall vary in size based on an uncertainty value associated with them. Lets say, if this value is zero, the size should be constant, if its approaching 1, the radius of those points should vary more and more. First, the points should gain in size and after reaching a maximum, they should decrease until a minimum, and so on. A function to describe this phenomenon could be p  precodepointSize  x  c  pointUncertainty, where x  standard point size                                                c  scaling constant codepre  pFrom what Ive read, this could potentially be achieved by passing a uniform timer variable to my vertex shader and compute the point size in there. However, all the points should vary in the same time, meaning that a point that has an uncertainty of 1 and a point that has an uncertainty of 0.5 should reach their minimum and maximum value of pointSize at the same time. Additionally, the whole process shouldnt be dependent on the frame rate.p  pIm not sure whats the best way of getting this done, how the increasedecreaseincreasepattern could be implemented best and where to put the necessary OpenGL 4.2 commands.p  pEDIT I still hope to get an answer to this question, since The whole process of how such an animation effect could be achieved is unclear to me.p

In my ListActivitys onDestroy method I have the following codep  precodeOverride protected void onDestroy          super.onDestroy               ifisFinishing listActivityDone  true        codepre  pNow my problem is that when the user presses the BACK button in the ListActivity, my NDK thread gets woken up correctly but unfortunately, onDestroy is called emafterem my NDK thread has been woken up, thus my NDK thread does not get the correct value of the flag listActivityDone. When my NDK thread is woken up, listActivityDone is still FALSE because onDestroy is called immediately after my NDK thread gets woken up.p  pSo what I need to do to solve this problem is wake up the NDK thread once again after having set the flag listActivityDone to TRUE. Does anybody know how this can be achievedp  pOf course, I could call a C function from Java and then call ALooperwake but Im almost sure that there is a nicer version to wake up the NDK thread from the Java side. Any ideasp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 22753 pI have found this thread on creating and uploading thumbnail images client side. The tread shows how to upload the first image then follow up by resizing it and uploading again. I was wondering if there is an easy way to add another step so the end result would produce and original, medium size and thumbnailp  precodeA better solution is to trigger QueueChanged in the FileUploaded handler, and then call refresh. This will initiate the upload again for the same file and you can set a property that you read in the BeforeUpload handler to adjust the file size. codepre  pWarning 1 you should upload the thumbnail after the fullsized image, otherwise the fullsized image may have some buffer issues and get cut off.p  pWarning 2 This will only work if the bind call for FileUploaded happens after uploader.init, otherwise the uploaders own handler for FileUploaded will overwrite file.status back to DONE after your handler.p  pbelow is the original response from this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11507173pluploadthumbnailPlupload Thumbnailap  precodeuploader.bindBeforeUpload, functionup, file      ifthumb in file       up.settings.resize  width  150, height  150, quality  100     else       up.settings.resize  width  1600, height  1600, quality  100   uploader.bindFileUploaded, functionup, file      ifthumb in file          file.thumb  true         file.loaded  0         file.percent  0         file.status  plupload.QUEUED         up.triggerQueueChanged         up.refresh       codepre

Negative 22753 psearching for a long time, but didnt find any answer on that onep  pI have a server and I have a client. The server should receive an object via codeObjectInputStreamcode and codeObjectOutputStreamcode. That already works for any codeclasscode, known on the server. Now I want to send an codeObjectcode of a codeclasscode the server doesnt know. He only knows the interface of that class. And that obviously fails...p  pHow can I avoid the codeClassNotFoundExceptioncode I thought interfaces were the solution. I only want to access the functions I know by the interface, but Java wants to have the class anyway.p  pThank you.p

Negative 22753 pI have seen this question asked for several times on SO but I havent found the answer that works for me yet.p  pIm designing an eCommerce system where we have a simple inventory management system. Basically, each product can have many attributes, and each attribute variation set can have different quantity. The relationship between products and attributes is many2many and is managed elsewhere, the inventory table simply takes care of the quantity management only.p  pSo my current approach is to store the combination of attributes values ids as a string in the database and md5 it and stored in another column for faster searching. This approach allows me to quickly search for the inventory quantity given the list of attributes, and it also allows me to edit easily via admin.p  pThe table has the follow columns I cut short it a bit to focus on the main structure onlyp  precode  id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ,   productid INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ,   containerid INT UNSIGNED NULL ,   lotid INT UNSIGNED NULL DEFAULT NULL ,   facilityid INT UNSIGNED NULL DEFAULT NULL ,   inventoryitemstatustypeid INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ,   featurevalueids TEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL ,   key VARCHAR255 NULL DEFAULT NULL ,   serial VARCHAR255 NULL ,   quantityonhand INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0  codepre  pThe drawback of this method isp  ol liIf the product have these attributes 1,2,3,4,5li liThe inventory is defined for 1,3,4 and 1,2,3,4 but not 1,2,3,4,5li liWhen the user selects 1,2,3,4,5 then 1 possible desired behavior is that the system should use the quantity of 1,2,3,4 which is the closest combination it can get. In this case, we may have to use fulltext match for closest combinationli ol  pFor this issue, do you think if there is anything wrong with the above approach, and how would you do it differentlyp

Negative 22753 pI am building a websocket server in C. Right now it is following the rfc6455 specification and I have managed to get as far as implementing a chat protocol, such that connected clients can send messages to each other. To test the strength of my server I ran a piece of javascript to test if it could handle several messages from the same client per secondp  precodei   a  0 t  setIntervala i  .................................................................................................... doSenda  i, 20 codepre  pWhat the code above does is send a message each 20 ms. Furthermore the message that is sent, is 100 bytes larger for every message. The server manage to get the messages and send it to the connected clients the first 360 times, but then something weird happened.p  pFor every message the server receives, it takes the payload length of it, which for message 360 would be 3601003  36003. This value is given in the first part of the message and so we rely on that the message will actually be 36003 bytes long. p  pI use the function recv to receive data from the socket connection and right now I have a buffer size of 8192 bytes. When I receive a message larger than my buffer size, I simply call recv once again until the whole message is received. The weird thing is that when I receive message number 360, I should read the buffer 5 times 58192  40000 to receive the whole message. Instead of my read number 5 being 3235 bytes 3600348192 the recv function returns a full buffer aka. 8192 bytes. Does any have a clue about what is going onp

Negative 22753 pHi everyone and thanks a lot for helping and excuse me for my rusty english . I was trying to create a  mvc website with spring 3.x , springsecurity ,and .jsp pages, i can paste a lot of code here but i think it will be useless because it is a kind of logic problem on how the URI of the action and the uri of the controller worksp  p1Jsp pages      login    avalaible to all guests and return homeAdmin for admins with action home orbr     homeUser  for users with the action br     homeAdmin  provides a menu with different actions mapped with  adminaction br     HomeUser  provides a menu with different actions mapped with  useraction br     UserLIst a page that list every users and their information in a tablebrp  p2Controller        guest controller no class controller ,there are only two methods. First for mapping value , home and latter for login. So everyone that try to do a request will be redirect to the login page for be able to loginp  precodeController    public class LoginController      RequestMappingvaluehome,    codeif admin homeAdmin else homeUser    return new ModelAndViewhome     RequestMappingvaluelogin, method  RequestMethod.GET    code    return new ModelAndViewlogin .... codepre  pThere is a requestmapping for the class with the value admin for map the first part of the Uriactionand there are different methods with the request mapping for a specificated action , like list User. AdminControllerp  precodecontroller RequestMappingadmin public class AdminController   RequestMappingvaluelist, adminFilm code return new ModelAndViewadminFilm ... codepre  pNow i do login as admin and my URL becamebr codelocalhost8080nameprojecthomeAdmin.jspcodebr which is URI corresponding to URL brcodewebappmetainfviewshomeAdmin.jspcode brgenerated by method InternalResuorceViewResolver into its xml page.br Pressing the button List User I perform an actionadminlist, now my URI isbr codelocalhost8080nameprojectadminlistUser.jspcode br At this point any of my action dont need to generate admin  because is alredy in the path but if try to logout jspringsecurityLogout my URL in the top becames from br     codelocalhost8080nameprojectadminlistUsercode,br to  brcodelocalhost8080nameprojectadminjspringLogoutcodebrso i get naturally an error for a mapping not found.br Same problem appears for homepage request because it is mapped by LoginController and not in AdminController, so when i request it from any page that have path adminhome, this is not found and cant call the controller in loginController. I could solve it forcing paths of jsp pages, but its bad programming and generates errors. How can i solve this problem of pathsp  pIf problem isnt understandable, Ill try to rewrite it.p  pThanks.p

Negative 22753 pI have a MySQL database with innodb as the storage engine, and I have a number of queries that take the basic formp  precodeSELECT bd.billing,   SUMCASE WHEN tc.transactionclass  c  THEN bd.amount ELSE 0 END AS charges,   SUMCASE WHEN tc.transactionclass  a THEN bd.amount ELSE 0 END AS adjustments,   SUMCASE WHEN tc.transactionclass  p THEN bd.amount ELSE 0 END AS payments,   SUMbd.amount AS balancethismonth FROM billingdetails bd JOIN transactionclasses tc ON tc.transactioncode  bd.transactioncode WHERE bd.entrydate BETWEEN 20130604 AND 20130701 GROUP BY billing codepre  pI am trying to work out the best strategy for indexing the columns for queries that take this form.  Before I started, there were only indexes on single columns, and an explain revealed that 1.5M rows were being read for, as you can see here, what is only a months worth of data.p  pMy first attempt got this number down to 300,000, which was achieved by indexing entrydate, billing, transactioncode.  After doing some more reading in particular High Performance MySQL I decided that having entrydate typically a range expression as my leftmost column was not optimal, so I tried billing, transactioncode, entrydate and explain revealed something more like 4500,000 rows.  Still an improvement over the first number, but as I dig deeper, Ive come to wonderp  pWhat could I reasonably expect from an optimal index for a query of this kind  I am guessing that since I am performing an aggregate function, it is always going to build a temp table and do a filesort ... or is it  The more I read, the more confused I get.  My instinct was to use entrydate as the leftmost column, since it is the only stipulation in my where clause.  More research led me to believe I should put it rightmost, since I am querying a range of dates.  But then what Ive read only really talks about the where clause  which only has entrydate what about a sumcase query such as this And could I add amount to this index in a way that is beneficial, or am I going to be stuck with what I have unless I redesign the schemaqueryp

Negative 22753 pIve researched a while on this topic but havent found a real solution to what I am trying to achieve. p  pIm working with a nested onetomany nested form Project has many Tasks. And each task has many attributes, e.g. type, assignedindividual, duedate, etc. I got no problem having the parent Project and the nested child model Tasks savedupdated on one submit. But what I need to achieve seems to be the opposite of this effort. I need one Ajax save call for each Task besides the global submit. so when the task list gets long, users dont have to worry about losing what they have written earlier for the other tasks. They can click that save button and gets a feedback saying that what he has entered for the task has been saved.p  pCurrently the Project is in a formfor wrapper, and the Tasks are in fieldsfor partial these are the simplified version of what I have right now.

Negative 22753 pI might be confusing how region monitoring works, but this is what i have so farp  pI am registering a region to monitor through my location manager, which is implemented on a singleton class, this singleton is also set as the delegate of the location manager so the implemented method is being called.p  precode voidlocationManagerCLLocationManager manager didEnterRegionCLRegion region codepre  pThis works totally as expected, if the app is active or suspended the method is being called. It also makes total sense because the class has been already loaded and when the region enter event occurs iOS sends this even to my app which calls the location manager who registered probably has a reference to it and in turn it calls whatever delegate was also registered along it since the class is there ready and loaded.p  pThe issue is, what happens when the app has been killed Is it first launched into the background How does iOS know what delegate method to call, and if it has already been loadedp

Negative 22753 pThe Storyp  pSay you are creating a site where people can search for each other based on their favorite movies. So you have codeUsercode and codeMoviecode as your main two entities.  There are few options when it comes to relating codeUserscode and codeMoviescode to capture the notion of a favorite movie.p  pFirst Create a list of codeMoviecode keys on codeUsercodep  pThe models may then look something like thisp  precodeclass Userndb.Model     username  ndb.StringProperty     userid  ndb.IntegerProperty     email  ndb.StringProperty     favoritemovies  ndb.KeyPropertykindMovie, repeatedTrue  class Moviendb.Model     title  ndb.StringProperty     description  ndb.TextProperty codepre  pSecond Create a separate entity for the relationshipp  pThe the models may then look like the followingp  precodeclass Userndb.Model     username  ndb.StringProperty     userid  ndb.IntegerProperty     email  ndb.StringProperty  class Moviendb.Model     title  ndb.StringProperty     description  ndb.TextProperty  class FavoriteMoviendb.Model     user  ndb.KeyPropertykindUser     movie  ndb.KeyPropertykindMovie     rating  ndb.IntegerProperty codepre  pOne of the benefits of taking the second approach is that we can add additional information about the relationship such as the rating a user gave to hisher favorite movie.  Another reason to consider the second approach is if both sides have lots of relationships. In this example a user has lots of favorite movies and a movie is favorited by lots of users.p  pNow say we dont know if people will have lots of favorite movies or if movies will be favorited by lots of people and we would like to be flexible so that we dont need to make a rushed design change. Additionally you may want to let users rate their favorite movies at some point and again would like some flexibility there. However, one thing that we do know is that if this site gets big, efficiency is king and ultimately if flexibility means reduced efficiency we would rather not lose the efficiency. The second approach is a cause for concern then because the docs warn us that it will require additional calls to the database to traverse the relationships.p  pSo to know if efficiency will be a problem we need to look at the kinds of queries we will need to run and in our case the most commonly executed query will be something like Give me all of the users who have Forest Gump as a favorite movie or Give me all of the users that have Forest Gump and Cast Away as a favorite movie. We also need to know what data we need when. Most likely we wont need the entire user to come back for those queries and instead will only need a name, and a photo back to build our list of users on the UI. Given this, we can denormalize our data a bit and put the users name and photo url on the relationship. Doing this would allow us to avoid making subsequent calls to the database for that data and if the person actually picks a user to view hisher profile we can make the call to the database then.p  pThe Questionp  pThese have been thoughts on a problem similar to the one described above.  As you may be able to tell Im leaning towards using the second approach to model my manytomany relationship.  There is one major concern I have however. In the second query example I gave I asked for users with Forest Gump strongANDstrong Cast Away as favorites. I dont know how this would be done efficiently with the second approach and it is crucial that users be able to ask that sort of question.  Also, what effect would asking for users with Forest Gump strongORstrong Cast Away as favorites have. Are these concerns enough to use the first approach or is there an even better approach that I have not considered herep  pI appreciate any thoughts on the subject.p  pThanks, Tomp

The class that I am trying to port is a hrefhttpwww.cocos2diphone.orgforumstopicccmaskforcocos2d relnofollowherea.p  pSomewhere I read that if I do CCRenderTexture under the layers onEnter callback the code will not crash and it doesnt crash when I do it like that. But then I dont get any masked sprite either as I have to add the CCMask class as a child to a layer to call the onEnter method.p  pCan anybody help me with the proper flow of the code or by confirming that it really works for cocos2dandroid a hrefhttpcode.google.compcocos2dandroid1 relnofollowThisa is the link for the library that I am using.p

Negative 22753 pI have an android application I build which gets the current location.p  pI want to call this method from a server, and get the location, instead of using a timer in the application which sends the location to the server.p  pIs there a way to do thisp
Negative 22753 pIm rewriting some of my old NHibernate code to be more database agnostic and use NHibernate queries rather than hard coded codeSELECTcode statements or database views.  Im stuck with one thats incredibly slow after being rewritten.  The SQL query is as suchp  precode SELECT     r.recipeingredientid AS id,     r.ingredientid,     r.recipeid,     r.qty,     r.unit,     i.conversiontype,     i.unitweight,     f.unittype,     f.formamount,     f.formunit    FROM recipeingredients r    INNER JOIN shoppingingredients i USING ingredientid    LEFT JOIN ingredientforms f USING ingredientformid codepre  pSo, its a pretty basic query with a couple JOINs that selects a few columns from each table.  This query happens to return about 400,000 rows and has roughly a 5 second execution time.  My first attempt to express it as an NHibernate query was as suchp  precodevar timer  new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch timer.Start var recIngs  session.QueryOverltModels.RecipeIngredientsgt    .Fetchprop gt prop.Ingredient.Eager    .Fetchprop gt prop.IngredientForm.Eager    .List timer.Stop codepre  pThis code works and generates the desired SQL, however it takes 120,264ms to run.  After that, I loop through coderecIngscode and populate a codeListltTgtcode collection, which takes under a second.  So, something NHibernate is doing is emextremelyem slow  I have a feeling this is simply the overhead of constructing instances of my model classes for each row.  However, in my case, Im only using a couple properties from each table, so maybe I can optimize this.p  pThe first thing I tried was thisp  precodeIngredientForms joinForm  null Ingredients joinIng  null var recIngs  session.QueryOverltModels.RecipeIngredientsgt    .JoinAliasr gt r.IngredientForm,  gt joinForm    .JoinAliasr gt r.Ingredient,  gt joinIng    .Selectr gt joinForm.FormDisplayName    .ListltStringgt codepre  pHere, I just grab a single value from one of my JOINed tables.  The SQL code is once again correct and this time it emonlyem grabs the codeFormDisplayNamecode column in the select clause.  This call takes 2498ms to run.  I think were on to somethingp  pHowever, I of course need to return several different columns, not just one.  Heres where things get tricky.  My first attempt is an anonymous typep  precode.Selectr gt new  DisplayName  joinForm.FormDisplayName, IngName  joinIng.DisplayName  codepre  pIdeally, this should return a collection of anonymous types with both a codeDisplayNamecode and an codeIngNamecode property.  However, this causes an exception in NHibernatep  blockquote   pObject reference not set to an instance of an object.p blockquote  pPlus, code.Listcode is trying to return a list of codeRecipeIngredientscode, not anonymous types.  I also tried code.ListltObjectgtcode to no avail.  Hmm.  Well, perhaps I can create a new type and return a collection of thosep  precode.Selectr gt new TestTyper codepre  pThe codeTestTypecode construction would take a codeRecipeIngredientscode object and do whatever.  However, when I do this, NHibernate throws the following exceptionp  blockquote   pAn unhandled exception of type NHibernate.MappingException occurred   in NHibernate.dllp      pAdditional information No persister for KitchenPC.Modeler.TestTypep blockquote  pI guess NHibernate wants to generate a model matching the schema of codeRecipeIngredientscode.p  pHow can I do what Im trying to do  It seems that code.Selectcode can only be used for selecting a list of a single column.  Is there a way to use it to select multiple columnsp  pPerhaps one way would be to create a model with my exact schema, however I think that would end up being just as slow as the original attempt.p  pIs there any way to return this much data from the server without the massive overhead, without hard coding a SQL string into the program or depending on a codeVIEWcode in the database  Id like to keep my code completely database agnostic.  Thanksp

Negative 22753 pSo Im working with ucLinux under the NXP LPC1788 processor ARMCortexM3, no MMU.  The ucLinux port was orignally done by Emcraft Systems.p  pThe 1788 has 512KiB of onboard flash called eNVM which is faster to access than the rest of memory connected via the external memory controller.  Emcrafts linker script has a portion where you can relocate critical parts of the kernel to this eNVM area.  Im using 80K for the bootloader so I have 432K free to stuff with as much kernel as I can.p  pSo the linker script, vmlinux.lds.S, has a portion that begins like thisp  precodeifdef CONFIGKERNELINENVM envmloc  .  .envm  ENVMPHYSOFFSET  CONFIGKERNELINENVMOFFSET  1024       envmstart  .  if CONFIGKERNELINENVMSIZEgt0     exceptiontextstart  .     .exception.text     .exception.rodata     exceptiontextend  .     SCHEDTEXT     LOCKTEXT     KPROBESTEXT      usrbuiltin.o.text     usrbuiltin.o.rodata     initbuiltin.o.text     initbuiltin.o.rodata     mmbuiltin.o.text     mmbuiltin.o.rodata codepre  p...and so on.  As you can see, entire subdirectories are being pulled in via their builtin.o object file.p  pAs I get closer and closer to the end of the flash space, Id like to have a bit more control over what gets linked here.  driversbuiltin.o, for example, wont fit in the free space but if I could get driversusb and driversinput here, that would help a lot.p  pIf I modify the linker script to have just those portions, like thisp  precode    driversusbbuiltin.o.text     driversusbbuiltin.o.rodata     driversinputbuiltin.o.text     driversinputbuiltin.o.rodata codepre  pthen I get duplicate symbol errors when driversbuiltin.o gets linked.  I cant see where that happens exactly, so thats part of the problem I think.p  pSo the question Is there a way to link individual builtin.o files to different regions without linking the master .o built at the top of the directoryp  pIve put the whole linker file at a hrefhttppastebin.comqcj6rHme relnofollowhttppastebin.comqcj6rHmea if anyone wants to take a look.  p  pThanksp

Negative 22753 pI have been playing with ruby recently and understand some basics about passing a block to a method and how to yield values back to the block etc, but I came across the following code in Rspecp  precodeRSpec.configure do config     config.usetransactionalfixtures  true end codepre  pNow this looks very weired and interesting to me at the same time, but I dont fully understand it.

In the interests of DRY and using Laravels awesome helpers etc I want to know if anyone has a solution to this  For registering a new user, all the examples and documentation I can find, seem to have a form which asks for email, username etc  The input is verified or not and a user is created and added to db. Some examples go on to send a welcome email to the new user. I have an issue with this process as anyone can sign up using any email address even if it is not theirs. Hence my desire to incorporate an email with an activation link to ensure ownership of the address before user activation.p  pAm I missing something or does Laravel have some sort of token generating function that can assist in generating a token andor emailing to a new user I have setup password reminders and see there is an awesome method  Passwordremind which generates a token etc and sends an email to the user, and was wondering if there is such a thing I could use for activation email.p  pIf not the only way I can see this being possible is to add 2 fields to the db token and useractivated then in controller when user is saved, gen a token somehow and save it and a value to the useractivated field. Then send out an email with a link to a controller which when clicked checks the token, matches the user and updates the useractivated field and logs the user on etc.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 22753 pI have the multitier webapplication. It has the RESTservice and the WEBcomponent on the additional external server. But both are use the same domain classes I write the standalone plugin for them. The RESTservice is needed database access and it has Hibernate plugin in the dependencies. But WEBcomponent doesnt needed that plugin because it is only RESTclient. After some time of project existence, we are comprehended that we are needed Spring Security. And the Security plugin demands database access from us. So, on Grails 2.2 Ive added hibernate plugin to project, because of the same domain classes between projects. Though that was wrong, but that works. Now Im trying to upgrade to Grails 2.4 and Hibernate4 and Im still having that problem. WEBcomponent Grails has tried to createupdate tables for domain and writes error logs on fail. So, here is the question. Is there are exists any way to excludeinclude some classes from hibernate processing I want to say Hey, hibernate, please do what you want with Spring Security and dont touch my own domain classes.

Negative 22753 pIm trying to implement gradient calculation for neural networks using backpropagation. I cannot get it to work with cross entropy error and rectified linear unit ReLU as activation.p  pI managed to get my implementation working for squared error with sigmoid, tanh and ReLU activation functions. Cross entropy CE error with sigmoid activation gradient is computed correctly. However, when I change activation to ReLU  it fails. Im skipping tanh for CE as it retuls values in 1,1 range.p  pIs it because of the behavior of log function at values close to 0 which is returned by ReLUs approx. 50 of the time for normalized inputs I tried to mitiage that problem withp  precodelogmaxy,eps codepre  pbut it only helped to bring error and gradients back to real numbers  they are still different from numerical gradient.p  pI verify the results using numerical gradientp  precodenumgrad  fWepsilon  fWepsilon  2epsilon codepre  pThe following matlab code presents a simplified and condensed backpropagation implementation used in my experimentsp  precodefunction [f, df]  backpropW, X, Y  W  weights  X  input values  Y  target values  acttyperelu     possible values sigmoid  tanh  relu errortype  CE   possible values SE  CE  NsizeX,1 ninpsizeX,2 nhid100 noutsizeY,2 w1reshapeW1nhidninp1,nhid,ninp1 w2reshapeWnhidninp11end,nout, nhid1   feedforward X[X onesN,1] z2Xw1 a2actz2,acttype a2[a2 onesN,1] z3a2w2 yactz3,acttype  if strcmperrortype, CE    cross entropy error  logistic cost function     fsumsum Y.logmaxy,eps1Y.logmax1y,eps  else  squared error     f0.5sumsumyY.2 end   backprop if strcmperrortype, CE    cross entropy error     d3yY else  squared error     d3yY.dactz3,acttype end  df2d3a2 d2d3w2,1end1.dactz2,acttype df1d2X  df[df1df2]  end  function factz,type  activation function switch type     case sigmoid         f1.1expz     case tanh         ftanhz     case relu         fmax0,z end end  function dfdactz,type  derivative of activation function switch type     case sigmoid         dfactz,type.1actz,type     case tanh         df1actz,type.2     case relu         dfdoublezgt0 end end codepre  hr  pstrongEditstrong  p  pAfter another round of experiments, I found out that using a softmax for the last layer  p  precodeybsxfunrdivide, expz3, sumexpz3,2 codepre  pand softmax cost functionp  precodefsumsumY.logy codepre  pmake the implementaion working for all activation functions including ReLU.    p  pThis leads me to conclusion that it is the logistic cost function binary clasifier that does not work with ReLUp  precodefsumsum Y.logmaxy,eps1Y.logmax1y,eps  codepre  pHowever, I still cannot figure out where the problem lies.p

I have made it Visible  Screen only to take care of anyone that wants to print a hard copy anytime during the process. However, I have a feeling the client will complain that the Submit button shows up on screen. Also, the final, flattened pdf should not show the button as its being submitted to an official repository for these forms in which other forms dont have a submit button.p  pAfter the 3rd person signs, I can easily set the submit button presence to hidden.

How will the android system will handle displaying this image on my screen Is it something that my application should handle or android system will scale the image as per my screen configuration.

Negative 22753 pI have a three dimensional textured surface that I need to draw a colored line on.  This would be similar to drawing lines of latitudelongitude on a sphere.  Is there a simple way to draw a line onto this surface  The best result I have gotten so far is calculating points along the surface and making those my line vertices but this seems a little buggy as there are places where the line shows well and places where it doesnt.  Also, if I use this method do I need to offset the line out from the surface or do something else so that they dont overlap and show the surface instead of the linep

Negative 22753 pIve been dabbling a bit recently with Entity Framework 5.0.  The application that Im writing currently uses a database on a developmenttesting server.  Once the application is complete, though, it should be able to connect to multiple instances of the database on different servers.  Basically, the same database will be on several different serves.  They have the exact same layout, just different information contained within.p  pThe user should be able to select which server they will access from a dropdown on the form.  Using their choice, the program will connect to the correct database server.p  pSo, Im wondering what caveats I should keep in mind while attempting this  Is it feasibledoable to let the program choose a different databaseserver based on user input  Will I have any special considerations because of using EF 5.0p
Negative 22753 pI have a web forms application that has a function that saves an image from an IPcamera.  The I added a viewer page that is supposed to refresh the image, but it wasnt working.

Negative 22753 pI have wrapped Windows API touch functions into my wrapper classes and am successfully able to inject touch. To specify the touch coordinates I am using ptPixelLocation member of POINTERTOUCHINFO struct. So, like thisp  precodePOINTERTOUCHINFO pTouchInfo memsetamppTouchInfo, 0, sizeofPOINTERTOUCHINFO pTouchInfo.pointerInfo.ptPixelLocation.x  myDesiredX pTouchInfo.pointerInfo.ptPixelLocation.y  myDesiredY codepre  pThis works fine and I am able to successfully inject touch into both of my touchscreen monitors. However, some features e.g. Windows Charms bar, do not work when I have BOTH touch monitors on and the desktop extended. But when I switch the ONE monitor only, or when I duplicate the desktop on BOTH screens, Charms bar STARTS to work.p  pThis makes me think that maybe I should use ptPixelLocationRaw, instead of ptPixelLocation to specify touch location.

Negative 22753 pI am interested in how the ordering of RequestMappings in Spring 3.2.x is supposed to work. I have tried this with versions 3.2.9 and 3.2.10. Given a request to url codexxxabccode and matching mappings codecode, codexxxabccode and codexxxacode, the comparison in codeRequestMappingHandlerMapping.lookupHandlerMethodcode yields as best match codecode. However, I would expect codexxxabccode to be the best match. Can anyone explain this to mep  pstrongEditstrong So Ive looked into the code and found out that codeRequestMappingInfocode uses codeAntPathMatchercode to compare the pattern matches. What the latter does is to first check for exact matches, then count wildcards for each, braces for each, add them up and return the difference. Thus it evaluates codecode as more specific than codexxxabccode. However, this is incorrect IMO and previous versions of Spring used to have different behaviour. Can anyone comment on the issue or suggest a fixp

Negative 22753 pIm having an issue with compilation ordering in a mixed JavaGroovy environment. Were using Gradle 2.1, JDK 7, and Groovy 2.3. The code compiles fine in STS Spring Tool Suite, using the Gradle plugin and the same build.gradle files, but fails when the build is run on the command line. STS is configured to use the Groovy Eclipse plugin, which if I understand things correctly, uses its own compiler. So I think this problem stems from a compilation ordering problem when we use the Groovy compiler from Gradles Groovy plugin. This is the Groovy classp  precodeComponent ToStringincludeNames  true, includePackage  false class ManagedCloseableHttpClientFactory implements ClientHttpRequestFactory    Delegate   HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory factory ...  codepre  pThe ClientHttpRequestFactory is a Spring interface that is implemented by the Spring class HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory. Somewhere else in the system, we have a Java class annotated with Configuration, where the ManagedCloseableHttpClientFactory is injected using Autowired. Like thisp  precodeConfiguration public class FooConfiguration    Autowired   private ManagedCloseableHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory ...  codepre  pWhen the build is run from the command line, we get the following error message strongUsersxyzsourceprjcommonbuildtmpcompileGroovygroovyjavastubscommonwebclientManagedCloseableHttpClientFactory.java10 error ManagedCloseableHttpClientFactory is not abstract and does not override abstract method createRequestURI,HttpMethod in ClientHttpRequestFactorystrong. If we move the field marked with Autowired to a Groovy class that is annotated with Configuration, everything works, but not when its declared inside a Java class. Im guessing that this is a compilation ordering issue. In our Gradle files, were using the groovy plugin, and have modified the source directories as followsp  precodeproject.sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs  [] project.sourceSets.test.java.srcDirs  [] project.sourceSets.main.groovy.srcDirs  [srcmainjava, srcmaingroovy] project.sourceSets.main.resources.srcDirs   [config] project.sourceSets.test.groovy.srcDirs  [srctestjava,srctestgroovy] codepre  pWhats the best approach here Thanks. p

Negative 22753 pstrongBackground infostrong Im creating a SpriteKit 2D platformstyle game with multiple floors. When the user enters a portal he is transported to another floor either one up or one down. If the user dies at a different floor from where the most recent spawnpoint is, he is transported back to the floor with the spawnpoint. p  pstrongProblemstrong After upgrading to iOS8, this scenario causes the game to crash with an codeEXCBADACCESScode exception error. Even after going through multiple tutorials on how to debug such errors, I cannot seem to find the problem. p  pemSo Id really appreciate if someone could take a look at my code and tell me if they see a better way of doing what Im doing, preferably without causing the game to freeze.emp  pstrongGame layoutstrong I have a custom class codeTileMapLayercode which is based on the same class from Ray Wenderlichs book emiOS Games By Tutorialsem. It is basically a custom SKNode class containing multiple 32x32p tiles, combined creating the background for my game. p  pI load the appropriate floor when the game begins, and then call to load another floor when my user goes updown. In this scenario, I cache the current floor first in a codeNSDictionarycode so I can access it later if the user returns to this floor. p  precode Cache the current floor [allFloors setObjectbgLayer forKey[NSString stringWithFormatfloortu, unsignedcurrentFloor]]   Remove the current floor [bgLayer removeFromParent]   Get the cached next floor if it exists, if not create it TileMapLayer cachedFloor  [allFloors objectForKey[NSString stringWithFormatfloortu, unsignedcurrentFloor  1]] if cachedFloor      bgLayer  [self createScenery[NSNumber numberWithIntegercurrentFloor  1]]     NSLogcreating new floor  else      bgLayer  cachedFloor     NSLoggetting cached floor    Display the new floor [worldNode addChildbgLayer]   Increment the floor number currentFloor codepre  pI have a similar method for going down a floor as well. This works perfectly, both before and after upgrading to iOS8.p  pWhen the user dies, he is transported back to the last spawnpoint. If the last spawnpoint is on a different floor, the floor also changes appropriately.  I call this custom SKAction on the ball itself as a part of an animationp  precodeSKAction changeFloor  [SKAction runBlock   if self.spawnFloor  currentFloor       [bgLayer removeFromParent]     bgLayer  [allFloors objectForKey[NSString stringWithFormatfloortu, unsignedself.spawnFloor]]     [worldNode addChildbgLayer]     currentFloor  self.spawnFloor     NSLogMade it here    ] codepre  pAs you can see there isnt much difference. The codeMade it herecode gets logged to the console, but the game freezes immediately after. The next method I call to move the ball to the correct location is not executed at all. p  pJust for fun I tried caching the codebgLayercode before removing it from its parent like sop  precodeif self.spawnFloor  currentFloor    [allFloors setObjectbgLayer forKey[NSString stringWithFormatfloortu, unsignedcurrentFloor]]   ... codepre  pAnd for some reason the game does not freeze when I do this. However, the floors end up being mixed as if the codebgLayercode never was removed from its parent note the old tiles does no longer react to any physicssimulations, theyre just in the background doing nothing.p  pI also tried code[bgLayer removeAllChildren]code removing the individual tiles right after removing from the parentp  precode[bgLayer removeFromParent] [bgLayer removeAllChildren] codepre  pBut this causes the bgLayer to be empty when I return to this floor after respawning. As if I removed all the nodes before I stored it in the dictionary. My guess is that the dictionary only references the location of the bgLayer, not the content itself. So when I remove all the children on screen, I effectively remove all of them in the cache as well.p  pstrongWrapupstrong I know this is a long question, and Id like to say thank you if you made it this far. If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to ask them in the comments below.  Ultimately, what Id like to know is this How can I resolve my problem so the game doesnt freeze Whats the best practice for caching the floors without causing memory problems Whats the best practice for removing and adding the nodes on screen, and always referring to the current floor the one thats on screen as codebgLayercodep  pAgain, thank you so muchp

Negative 22753 pI am using JavaEE6 application CDI1.0, JAXWS2.2, EJB3.1, JPA2.0, etc.. I use WAS8.5.5 for the actual deployment and WAS Liberty profile 8.5.5 as a developer edition. I use IBM embedded container to run all my junit test cases. The problem is embedded container only supports EJB3.1 Lite and those test cases which run on other EJB3.1 features like Timer, Messaging, Remote calls fail. What is the better approach to run my container test cases while still using the Maven scripts I have these scripts integrated into Jenkins environment. So, ideally when my application archive .ear is installed it would have passed all my container test cases.p

Negative 22753 pSo currently Im trying to implement a dary heap in java, but what I dont understand is how parents work exactly. I know that the formula for getting a nodes parent is element  d, but if your d was say 3, and you were finding element 2s parent, wouldnt it consistently return 0 instead of 1, which isnt supposed to be included in the heap Its really the only thing preventing me from finishing my program because when I insert a node, sift up isnt properly finding the correct parents like in the example I just stated.

Negative 22753 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pRecently my company upgraded from Oracle 11g to Exadata. All production objects and data were successfully migrated to the new system and were verified to be a 11 match between systems. Immediately after the first daily set of ETL processes were completed on our new system we discovered our reporting tables were significantly smaller than expected. Upon further investigation we discovered that a batch ID being added to LEFT OUTER joins were causing the problem where they had worked perfectly on 11g.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhy would the following query be treated as a LEFT OUTER JOIN on 11g, but an INNER JOIN on Exadatap  precodeSELECT       FROM DIMCALL CALLS LEFT OUTER JOIN FACTACTVYMNGMT ACTVYMNGMT     ON ACTVYMNGMT.CALLKEY  CALLS.CALLKEY     AND ACTVYMNGMT.BATCHID  20141112 LEFT OUTER JOIN DIMACTVY ACTVY     ON ACTVY.ACTVYKEY  ACTVYMNGMT.ACTVYKEY     AND ACTVYMNGMT.BATCHID  20141112 codepre  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIt appears there was either a typo in the query used in the ETL process or the original developer just overlooked this case. If you look at the last join youll notice that the join is on the ACTVYKEY and BATCHID. The issue is that the BATCHID its referencing is from the ACTVYMNGMT table. The database essentially treats this as a WHERE clause, so any case in which CALLKEY is NULL results in a failure.p

Negative 22753 pI have put together a Bootply demonstration here a hrefhttpwww.bootply.comSs2aAnzqlZ relnofollowhttpwww.bootply.comSs2aAnzqlZa.p  pIts a panel with a table as per a hrefhttpgetbootstrap.comcomponentspanelstables relnofollowhttpgetbootstrap.comcomponentspanelstablesa. However, Ive also made the panel collapsible. The collapsing bit works OK, but the table itself doesnt retain shape. As youll see in the Bootply, it doesnt fill the width of the panel when you first load the page. When you click Improvements in the panel header to collapse the panel, the table takes up the full panel width during the animation, then disappears. When you click again to show the panel content, the table is the full width until the animation stops, at which point, it shrinks back to what looks like an auto width.p  pOddly enough, inspecting the table element shows that the table itself is full width, but the thead, tbody and tfoot arent.p  pIve sort of tracked it down to the presence of the collapse class in the table. If you start the Bootply without the collapse class, its full width until you collapse the panel. When you expand it, it goes back to auto width.

Negative 22753 pI use embedded forms in my application and I was trying something like this p  pAt designtime the form is a normal form which dont know anything about embeddingdocking. With a ButtonClick I can make the form visible by calling the Show method of the form.  At runtime it can happen that the form gets docked into another form and becomes an embedded form. When I press the Button for showing the form again which is now embedded nothing happens because  I have to call Show for the form which contains the embedded form now. p  pI am lookin for a method to force showing the parent form when the Show method of the embedded form is called. I could handle this by checking the existance of a parent form before calling Show but I dont want to include this specific handling.p  pI would prefer to do this handling in the parent form wich gets notified when a form is docked.p  pThe Show method only sets the Visible property to true RAD Studio Help, so I dont think that a message is fired ...p  pDo you know a method to realize something like thisp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI want to put some information about my application because I guess that it is more a designing problem than a programming problem.p  pThe application uses several plugins to adapt to the connected hardware. The exe provides a dragampdock environment and contains a base class for dockable forms. The plugins dont have any knowledge about the docking implementation. By creating a dockable form and embedding a form from the plugin the plugin form becomes dockable. This is the reason why I want do get the parent form shown when somewhere the method Show of the embedded form is called.p

Negative 22753 pRecently we moved classic asp application vb6 com components from W2K3 server to W2K8 server. The only change made in the vb6 component is upgrade from MSXML 2.0 to MSXML 6.0. These vb6 components are compiled into dlls and registered as COM components on the server. The issue we are facing right now is that asp pages are taking a lot of time to load. The functionality which used to take 810 sec is now taking around 40 seconds. We inserted the logs and found that all the functions in vb6 code which are related to MSXML 6.0 upgrade have caused the slowness in the application.p  pOn further research, we found that vb6 modules which uses 64 bit version of MSXML6.0present under CWindowsSystem32 to load XML documents takes over two times longer to load an xml doc which uses 32bit version of MSXML6.0. present under CWindowssysWOW64p  pMicrosoft has provided a hotfix for this.

Negative 22753 pI will access the MSP430.dll see here via JNA. But this library has a dependency to other native library, which cames bundled with the MSP430.dll. This dependend native library is called HIL.dll. With use of jna.library.path all does work perfect. Now I would bundle the native librarys to my own .jar package. Then I would use the automatic native library loading from jar of the JNA framework. But this makes problems with native librarys that have dependencies. If I package the MSP430.dll and HIL.dll to my .jar package then I get following error JNA java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError and The specified module could not be found. This means, it was not possible to resolve the dependencies of the MSP430.dll to the HIL.dll. In the debug outputs of JNA i can see, only the MSP430.dll will extract from .jar package. In this context the error is understandable. In the next trail, I load the HIL.dll explicit and I can see the extraction of HIL.dll then of the MSP430.dll. But I get still the module error from JNA.p  pI have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method. I see JNA extracts the native librarys to system temp directory and creates an own temp directory in their. But now I think the problem is, JNA creats temp files for the native librarys wit jna prefix and a unique generated numeric value. Here the output of JNAp  precodeFound library HIL.dll at CUsersRD3AppDataLocalTempjna80961jna1305152974718331988.dll codepre  pI think the MSP430.dll needs the HIL.dll unrenamed for finding it.

Negative 22753 pSo I am completely and utterly confused on how to append a node to my linked list.  Basically, I have an Inventory object linked list, comprised of nodes containing an ItemStack object.  This ItemStack object contains the name of an item and the quantity of that item.  Within my Inventory.cpp file I have a function named addItems that has an ItemStack parameter.  p  pFor some reason when I attempt to append an ItemStack node to the end of my list and output the results the only output is the first and last ItemStack. It skips over the ItemStack nodes in the middle.  I am not sure if they are just being overwritten or what is going on.  I know it has to do with either my Inventory.cpp file or my Inventory.h file, as I am not allowed to modify any other file.  p  pThe input for this program is read from two files.  itemList01.txt  and inventoryList01.txt.  Furthermore,  the number of occupied slots in an inventory are not being being updated. If anyone would care to shed some light on the issues I am having I would greatly appreciate it.

Negative 22753 pI have a SQL statement to pull records. Certain staff have access to certain records.

If you paste in the result in its place the main query runs in 2 seconds. If you run the top SQL it takes over a minute to run. For some reason, how do you tell SQL to run the nested select first without breaking it into a temp table p  pMore info from all your suggestionsp  pMy SQL also has codeOFFSET 20 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLYcode. When removed the query is fast. It can return 1800 records in a 1 sec, but ask for 10 records takes 40 secs. p  pIf I change my order by to codestaffidcode it runs fast as well. The combination of codeorder bycode and codefetch nextcode is causing SQL to run a different execution plan. Since the codeWherecode clause is in a separate part of the software and I cant change the codeorder bycode, it is killing performance. p

This service is calling a class that performs all operations related to GCM.p  pSo, basically, this is the call to performed in the Servicep  precode      try            PackageInfo info  manager.getPackageInfothis.getPackageName, 0           currentVersion  info.versionCode        catch NameNotFoundException e              Handle exception               if registeredVersion  currentVersion            Log.iApplicationData.APPTAG, TAG   New version, updating           GcmUpdater upGcm  new GcmUpdatergetApplicationContext           Boolean update  upGcm.getAndUpdate           We update the current version           if update                prefs.setAppPrevVersioncurrentVersion            else                Log.eApplicationData.APPTAG, TAG   GCM not updated                     else             Log.iApplicationData.APPTAG, TAG   Same version, no GCM needed        codepre  pOk, I think the key point in the previous code is that I am initiating the class called GcmUpdater is initiated using the application context given by the service.p  pThe constructor of my class GcmUpdater is the followingp  precodepublic GcmUpdaterContext cont      context  cont     TAG  getClass.getName     prefs  new StorePreferencescontext  codepre  pNothing special, as you can see I am calling the method inside GcmUpdater called getAndUpdate, this method is the following onep  precodepublic Boolean getAndUpdate      String newregid  giveRegId     return updateGCMnewregid  codepre  pOk, the problem is coming now, is the public function giveRegIdp  precodepublic String giveRegId       try         return new RegisterGCM.execute.get     catchException ex         ex.printStackTrace         return null        codepre  pWhich calls to the asyncronous task RegisterGCM....p  precodepublic class RegisterGCM extends AsyncTaskltVoid,Void,Stringgt             Override     protected String doInBackgroundVoid... arg0              try              if gcm  null                  gcm  GoogleCloudMessaging.getInstancecontext                          regid  gcm.registerApplicationData.SENDERID             Log.iApplicationData.APPTAG, TAG Device registered, registration ID  regid           catch IOException ex              Log.eApplicationData.APPTAG, TAG     ex.getMessage                                    return regid           protected void onPostExecuteBoolean result          return         codepre  pThe problem I am facing is that the variable regid obtained is null and according to similar problems like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20820079googlecloudmessagingregisterfailsthis onea or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23239425googlecloudmessagingregistergivesnullpointererrorthis other one,a I should include the ApplicationContext, however that is passed as parameter in the constructor.p  pMoreover, the class RegisterGCM is used by my main activity and works.

Negative 22753 pIm having a lot of trouble understanding what Im doing wrong here.  Im trying to draw a circle centered around where the user touches.  There seems to be a yaxis offset when the circle is drawn pictures a hrefhttpi.imgur.comSUCc4MT.png relnofollowherea, a hrefhttpi.imgur.comfXQG0y9.png relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpi.imgur.com1M50Q3H.png relnofollowherea.  The cursor is the location where I touch the screen.  The green circle is plotting with event.getX and getY, while the red circle is event.getRawX and getRawY.  Ive looked some of the previous questions, and they usually recommend some sort of linear correction as you can see, the offset seems to get worse as we get towards the top and bottom of the screen, and the offset is different for the two different coordinate system.

Negative 22753 pI have started out with ObjectiveC recently and trying to understand the memory management. I came across a peculiar problem yesterday which was causing a memory leak of over 150MB I traced it down to a piece of code that was creating NSArray literal of NSNumbers. I managed to solve the issue using NSMutableArray using addObject, but I havent been able to grasp the concept as to why one method works and the other doesnt. I would love for someone with a better understanding of the memory management to explain the concept behind it so that I can avoid such mistakes in the future.p  pTo better illustrate my question, let me also provide the code snippets. So for instance, I have a function that creates a NSArray of few NSNumbers and returns it and it gets called many timesp  precodeNSArray getNSNumberArray      float num1  23.56     float num2  75.34     float num3  223.56      NSArray numArray  [[NSNumber numberWithFloatnum1], [NSNumber numberWithFloatnum2], [NSNumber numberWithFloatnum3]]     return numArray   voidcauseMemoryLeak      for int i  0 i lt 2000000 i              NSArray recieverArray  [self getNSNumberArray]       codepre  pThis results in memory being occupied to be more than 200MB on an iphone6. However if I change my function to bep  precodeNSArray getNSNumberArray      float num1  23.56     float num2  75.34     float num3  223.56      NSMutableArray numMutableArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]     NSNumber nsNumber1  [NSNumber numberWithFloatnum1]     NSNumber nsNumber2  [NSNumber numberWithFloatnum2]     NSNumber nsNumber3  [NSNumber numberWithFloatnum3]     [numMutableArray addObjectnsNumber1]     [numMutableArray addObjectnsNumber2]     [numMutableArray addObjectnsNumber3]     return numMutableArray   voidcauseMemoryLeak      for int i  0 i lt 2000000 i              NSArray recieverArray  [self getNSNumberArray]       codepre  pThis does not cause any memory issues.p  pMaybe I am missing something very obvious, but still cant figure out the reason behind this. Would really appreciate the help on this.

I will typically use a global service locator in case like this and I believe I understand why that can be evil, and very well might be biting me here  but the main reason being that precisely for something like a simulator or often for UI purposes, I dont want to take the dependency on the simulator in the constructor since its only used in some scenarios. More below.pli lipThe environment should be initialized after creation.  Hence the use of codeOnActivatingcode here, which works well except for one caveat...pli lipThe codeIndependentClasscode takes an codeIEnvironmentcode, and I want a fully initialized codeIEnvironmentcode at this point.  In this case though, the Resolve of the codeIndependentClasscode is what triggers the resolve of codeIEnvironmentcode.  So if I use codeOnActivatedcode, then we dont have the resolve problem, but the environment isnt Initialized until after the constructor is called. pli ul  pstrongThe actual problem finallystrongp  pAs written, what currently happensp  ul licodeResolveltIndependentClassgtcode triggers..li licodeResolveltIEnvironmentgtcodeli licodeOnActivatingltEnvironmentgtcode triggers codeEnvironment.Initializecode...li liWhich then calls codeSampleComponent.Initializecode...li liWhich calls the global scope codeResolveltIEnvironmentgtcode..li liWhich then resolvesinstantiates a second codeEnvironmentcodeli ul  pSo even though I have registered codeEnvironmentcode as a singleton, two instances are created.p  pIts not a bug, it appears to be the expected behavior since the codeInitializecode call occurs in codeOnActivatingcode and the instance hasnt yet be registered, but what should I do to resolve this p  pstrongId like to requirestrongp  ul lipThat the Environment codeResolvecode occurs on a deferred basis when codeSampleComponentcode is codeResolvecoded. Since an environment isnt always needed.pli lipThat the codeEnvironment.Initializecode call is made before the instance is passed to the codeSampleComponentcode ctor. pli lipThat codeSampleComponentcode not have to take an codeISimulatorcode ctor argument since its not required usually.  But I wouldnt be opposed to restructuring the factory pattern into something more Autofac friendly, as long as I dont have to require my nontop level components to be Autofac aware.pli ul  pBasically, I just want to require that the Initialization call is made prior to the IEnvironment instance being used, and since the codeEnvironmentcodecodeSampleComponentcodecodeSimulatorcode object graph is entirely separate, that seems like something that should be able to wired upexpressed.p  pstrongThings Ive triedstrongp  ul lipExplicitly resolving the trade environment first As noted, this works, but I find the requirement a little too constraining.  Mainly because I have some optional configuration that I like to allow via a UI or whatever after the container is built but before the environment is resolved, and since an environment or simulator isnt always required, I dont want to instantiate it until its needed.  Same holds true with codeIStartablecode or codeAutoActivatecode, unless theres an alternate way to use them Im not seeing.pli lipAbandoning the service locator pattern.  In that case though, Id need to express that codeSampleComponentcode needs to resolve an codeISimulatorcode only for certain values of serviceType, and otherwise pass null to the constructor or Propertyetc.  Is there a clean way to express thatpli lipFinally, creating my own instance registration, and storing the Environment instance as a static singleton.  Something likep  pbuilder.Registerc  CreateInstance.AsSelf.As.SingleInstance.OnActivatinge  e.Instance.Initializep  pWherep  precode    private static Environment globalInstance private static Environment CreateInstance      if globalInstance  null              globalInstance  new Environment          return globalInstance  codepre  pThis works, though 1. codeOnActivatingcode is still called for every new instance.  2. Just feels way too hacky  ultimately Im now managing the instance and construction, which is what the container is for.  Its also a little more annoying when you actually want to used the container to resolve parameters, but again can be worked around easily enough.pli ul  pSo ALL that said and I do greatly appreciate you making it this far, it seems like I have a fundamental misunderstanding here. Im guessing it relates to the service locator pattern andor the haphazard factory in the codeSampleComponentcode, but Ill stop speculating.  p  pstrongI guess the real question is What am I missingstrongp

Negative 22753 pI have seen many solutions to check if our own app is minimized,running or background.but is there a way to check if another app package is running or minimized so that based on that we can run a code.like an applocker.Here we need to turn off network for a certain apps according to the user selection on installed apps in device, so when that selected apps are on foreground, network should be disabled when the selected apps are closed or minimized.then enable the network.  Will it be compliant with Google play if we make such an app because somewhere i read they dont allow apps that interfere with other apps.so confused.p

Negative 22753 pI am currently working on a BMI calculator for my C class.  My app asks the user for either their height in feet and inches and their weight in pounds or their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms.  Their is a tab control that has buttons for Imperial mode or Metric mode.p  pIf the calculate button in the imperial tab is clicked, I need to make sure that the heightFt, heightIn, and weightLbs text boxes have been filled out.  Then I convert those to the metric units.  If the calculate button in the metric tab is clicked, I need to make sure that the heightCm and weightKg text boxes have been filled out.p  pOnce those are provided, I then convert the height and weight to BMI.

Negative 22753 pId like to simplify a BitBake recipe that installs a large directory structure by using some sort of recursive install routine rather than calling install many times. The source directory layout is frequently changing during development, which is causing far more recipe revisions than I want to deal with.p  pAs an example, how would the following doinstall be simplified from thisp  precodedoinstall      install d Dfoo     install m 0644 Sfoo. Dfoo      install d Dfooa     install m 0644 Sfooa. Dfooa      install d Dfoob     install m 0644 Sfoob. Dfoob      install d Dfooc     install m 0644 Sfooc. Dfooc      install d Dbar     install m 0644 Sbar. Dbar      install d Dbara     install m 0644 Sbara. Dbara      install d Dbarabananas     install m 0644 Sbarabananas. Dbarabananas  codepre  pTo something more like this pseudocodep  precodedoinstall      for each subdir in Sfoo         install subdir recursively to Dfoosubdir     end      for each subdir in Sbar         install subdir recursively to Dbarsubdir     end  codepre  pThe toplevel directories in our source files foo amp bar in the above example rarely change, so calling them out in the recipe is fine. Its the lower level directories that are frequently changing.p  pIt may be that cp r ends up being the way to go, but I believe Ive read that its frowned upon in BitBake recipes, so Im wondering if BitBake provides some alternate mechanism, or if theres some other reasonably standardized way to do this.p

Negative 22753 pI am fairly new to Liferay, and just learning with EE 6.2. p  pI am trying to determine the RIGHT way to arrange structures, templates, and asset publishers for the following use case p  ul liFacilitate a large catalog of informational articles with custom fields and parentchild hierarchy, similar to but not exactly a wiki.li liEach article shares the same display page, where individual article content displays dynamically based on incoming url. Passed in from another AP on another pageli liThe current article and any parent or child articles should be listed hierarchically in a sidebar containerAP on the same page. These related web content entries are not pages in and of themselves, so a basic Navigationbreadcrumbs portlet will not do.li liPage layout uses multiple APs, most displaying various content from the current article of the custom structure using multiple ADTs, among other portlets.li liMay not edit theme or core files. Any custom CSS is added to AP look amp feel.li liMay not invoke servicelocator in display templates. Pages are publicguest.li ul  pSo far, I have set a custom structure, and in order to complete that, I am prompted to add a custom template as well. p  pNext, I created another structure, and selected the first as the parent structure. The only added field is an integer where a user can assign a parent article by manually entering its ID. Seems a horrid way to do this, but I cant find another way, given my ignorance  the above constraints. I want to assign the same application display templates for both structures, but it doesnt seem to be an option. I had to create another template and name it as the child. p  pThen when I added an AP to my container page, I do not see either of the templates I just created as an option under Display Template. How do I select one of the custom templates I just made Conversely, how can I access the custom fields of my structures when creating a new ADT, outside of the manage structures contextp  pAm I approaching this right I havent found any documentation or good use cases about actually displaying parent and child structures. The only related material in their codex explains how to create a child structure, but not how to use it. Im also finding lots of frustration over the differences between display templates and application display templates. They all seem to do the same sort of thing but they are never all accessible from the same place p  pSo, simple version of my question is how do I set a custom AP display template to get content from both of my parent amp child custom structures p  pThank youp

Negative 22753 pIm trying to figure out the best strategy for mapping an NHibernate entity from another project as a field on one of my entities. Here is a simplified example of the scenariop  precodenamespace Domain.NHib               Domain.NHib has all its own mapping files.         I am referencing it as a compiled DLL.         It stands up its own database, has its own config files, etc.           public class DomainObject              public virtual Guid Id  get set          public virtual string Foo  get set          public virtual string Bar  get set         namespace Consumer.NHib      using Domain.NHib               This is my assembly.           public class DomainObjectWrapper              public virtual Guid Id  get set          public virtual DomainObject RootObject  get set          public virtual Guid RootObjectId  get set          public virtual int Status  get set        codepre  pMy primary concern is performance. Ive tried a couple approaches, likep  precodepublic class DomainObjectWrapperRepo      private DomainObjectRepo repo      public DomainObjectWrapper GetGuid id               get domain object         DomainObjectWrapper wrapper         wrapper.RootObject  repo.Getwrapper.RootObjectId       codepre  pBut that absolutely murders performance by accessing the Wrapper proxy, as well as generating a 1 to 1 objectquery ratio when loading Wrappers. I can circumvent the query issue pretty easily, but the proxy is still accessed.p  pAre there any decent approaches to this problem Id love to see a solution that assumes the DomainObject library is not mine  but the reality is that I do own it, and can make changes, if needed.p  pEDITp  pThe codeDomainObjectcode, in reality, has a complex relationship graph. I am not mapping it at all in the codeConsumer.NHibcode assembly  that is essentially what I am looking for advice on. I am trying to avoid remapping all the codeDomain.NHibcode objects in my codeConsumer.NHibcode library.p  pI guess I could just copy over the mapping files from the other solution I have read a couple articles today about using a multidatabase strategy in a single NHibernate project.p

I tested this by removing the events and the cpu usage goes down to 12.

Negative 22753 pI am new to QUnit and JavaScript so I apologise if this question is trivial, however I couldnt find an answer online. p  precode   When the document is loaded, the keypress events are attached with the form input fields.   document.readyfunction       loginEmail.keypressremoveLoginError     loginPassword.keypressremoveLoginError      Removed the login error banner when a key is pressed in either the login email or password fields.   function removeLoginError      alertHello     .loginErrorContainer.cssdisplay, none  codepre  pI have the following code, which attaches the keypress event for the codeloginEmailcode and codeloginPasswordcode fields to the function coderemoveLoginErrorcode on document ready.p  pI, then wrote a QUnit tests which checks that when a key is pressed in either of the fields mentioned above, the div with class code.loginErrorContainercode has the display attribute set to none. The test code is p  precodeQUnit.testLOGIN Checking that the error message box is hidden if a key is pressed in the email address field, function       .loginErrorContainer.cssdisplay, block     loginEmail.keypress     QUnit.deepEqual.loginErrorContainer.cssdisplay, none, Login Error message should not be shown  codepre  pWhen the test is run, the function coderemoveLoginErrorcode is not always called with each test run. The first time the test is run, a failure is reported stating that the code.loginErrorContainercode display is set to codeblockcode and the coderemoveLoginErrorcode function is not called because the message box does not show. If however I hit the refresh button, the alert box is shown and the test passes. Hitting the refresh button again would make the test fail and it keeps going on pass..fail..pass..fail.p  pSo my question is, how can I set QUnit to always call the coderemoveLoginErrorcode functionp  pWhen I assigned the event handler to the function in the beginning of the test it works fine. However, it beats the purpose of the test because I want to make sure that the event handlers are in place and set up correctly.p  pIf it is of any help I am using Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11. QUnit version 1.19 jQuery version 2.1.4p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 22753 pI am a Android Studio noob and I am building my project with API 23 Marshmallow while using Android Studio. I imported the socialize android sdk into Android Studio and added it to my build.gradle and settings.gradle. When I try to build my project I get compilation errors that shows the following code failing. p  precodeif Build.VERSION.SDKINT gt Build.VERSIONCODES.LOLLIPOP ampamp mNotification  null               mNotification.color  ContextCompat.getColormContext, R.color.Gold   codepre  pThe error I get isp  pError47, 39 error cannot find symbol method getColorContext,intp  pThis code fails even though I have the support library 23 as a dependency and building my project against API 23, and the import is present. Essentially the ContextCompat part of the code is failing, which was recently added to Android Marshmallow API. This code only fails when adding android socialize sdk to my project. If I remove the socialize sdk from my project then everything works fine. I think it has something to do with socialize sdk library building against kitkat and my app building against marshmallow, but I do not know. p  pI have my build.gradle setup like thisp  precodebuildscript      repositories          maven  url httpsmaven.fabric.iopublic           dependencies          classpath io.fabric.toolsgradle1.       apply plugin com.android.application apply plugin io.fabric repositories      maven  url httpsmaven.fabric.iopublic    android      compileSdkVersion Google Inc.Google APIs23     buildToolsVersion 23.0.1      defaultConfig          applicationId ...         minSdkVersion 9         targetSdkVersion 23         compileOptions              sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION17             targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION17                      buildTypes          release              minifyEnabled false             proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFileproguardandroid.txt, proguardrules.txt                 dependencies       compile com.ToxicBakery.viewpager.transformsviewpagertransforms1.2.32aar     compile com.squareupandroidtimessquare1.6.4aar     compile com.google.android.gmsplayservicesmaps8.1.0     compile com.google.android.gmsplayservicesads8.1.0     compile com.twotoasters.jazzylistviewlibrary1.2.1     compile com.android.supportappcompatv723.0.1     compile com.android.supportcardviewv723.0.1      compilede.keyboardsurfer.android.widgetcrouton1.8.5aar          exclude group com.google.android, module supportv4           compilecom.twitter.sdk.androidtwitter1.8.0aar          transitive  true           compile projectParseUi     compile projectSocialize  codepre  pMy settings.gradle set up likep  precodeinclude myapp include ParseUi include Socialize codepre  pbuild.gradle for socialize sdk android set up likep  precodeapply plugin com.android.library apply plugin maven apply plugin signing  repositories      mavenCentral     maven  url httpsoss.sonatype.orgcontentrepositoriessnapshots    dependencies      compile fileTreeinclude .jar, dir libs     compile com.socializefacebook3.1.6     compile com.socializeioc3.1.6     compile com.socializeloopy3.1.6   android      compileSdkVersion 20     buildToolsVersion 20.0.0      defaultConfig          minSdkVersion 9         targetSdkVersion 20         versionCode 1         versionName 1.0         testApplicationId com.socialize.test         testInstrumentationRunner com.socialize.SocializeTestRunner           compileOptions          sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION17         targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION17           sourceSets          main              manifest.srcFile AndroidManifest.xml             java.srcDirs  [src]             resources.srcDirs  [src]             aidl.srcDirs  [src]             renderscript.srcDirs  [src]             res.srcDirs  [res]             assets.srcDirs  [assets]                   androidTest              java.srcDirs  [src]             resources.srcDirs  [src]             aidl.srcDirs  [src]             renderscript.srcDirs  [src]             res.srcDirs  [res]             assets.srcDirs  [assets]                    Move the tests to testsjava, testsres, etc...         androidTest.setRoot..test           Move the build types to buildtypeslttypegt          For instance, buildtypesdebugjava, buildtypesdebugAndroidManifest.xml, ...
