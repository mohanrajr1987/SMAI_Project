Positive 22279 pI have a GStreamer pipeline to play live video from RTSP source. I want the user to be able to increase  decrease the delay. My approach to this is to have a codequeuecode element and manipulate its codeminthresholdtimecode parameter.p  pThis seems to work at start. On for instance 10 seconds delay, The pipeline starts frozen, and continues after 10 seconds. But if I manipulate the time, nothing happens. I have tried other parameters as well, like codemaxsizetimecode, without luck. codeleakycode parameter causes the video to be jerky and bad quality.p  pCurrently I am stopping and restarting the pipeline, which looks terrible.p  pPipeline I am usingp  precodegstlaunch1.0 rtspsrc locationlt...gt  rtph264depay  h264parse  capsfilter capsvideoxh264  avdech264  videoconvert  queue minthresholddelayltdelaygt  autovideosink codepre  pIs there a command to force queue to flush the frames, some other element better suitable, or some other trick to accomplish thisp
Positive 22279 pIve hit a complete brick wall in my attempt to use NVEnc to stream OpenGL frames as H264. Ive been at this particular issue for close to 8 hours without any progress.p  pThe problem is the call to codenvEncRegisterResourcecode, which invariably fails with code 23 enum value NVENCERRRESOURCEREGISTERFAILED, documented as failed to register the resource  thanks NVidia.p  pIm trying to follow a procedure outlined in a hrefhttpheim.ifi.uio.nopaalhstudentsMartinAlexanderWilhelmsen.pdf relnofollowthis documenta from the University of Oslo page 54, OpenGL interop, so I know for a fact that this is supposed to work, though unfortunately said document does not provide the code itself.p  pThe idea is fairly straightforwardp  ol limap the texture produced by the OpenGL frame buffer object into CUDAli licopy the texture into a previously allocated CUDA buffer li limap that buffer as an NVEnc input resourceli liuse that input resource as the source for the encodingli ol  pAs I said, the problem is step 3. Here are the relevant code snippets Im omitting error handling for brevity.p  precode Round up width and height privgtencWidth  resolution.w  31 amp 31, privgtencHeight  resolution.h  31 amp 31   Allocate CUDA pitched memory to match the input texture YUV, one byte per component cuErr  cudaMallocPitchampprivgtcudaMemPtr, ampprivgtcudaMemPitch, 3  privgtencWidth, privgtencHeight codepre  pThis should allocate ondevice CUDA memory the pitched variety, though Ive tried nonpitched too, without any change in the outcome.p  precode Register the CUDA buffer as an input resource NVENCREGISTERRESOURCE regResParams   0  regResParams.version  NVENCREGISTERRESOURCEVER regResParams.resourceType  NVENCINPUTRESOURCETYPECUDADEVICEPTR regResParams.width   privgtencWidth regResParams.height  privgtencHeight regResParams.bufferFormat  NVENCBUFFERFORMATYUV444PL regResParams.resourceToRegister  privgtcudaMemPtr regResParams.pitch  privgtcudaMemPitch encStat  nvEncApi.nvEncRegisterResourceprivgtnvEncoder, ampregResParams                   FAILS privgtnvEncInpRes  regResParams.registeredResource codepre  pThis is the brick wall.

The only observable difference to the original code is that codecuPopContextcode returns an error which can be ignored here  probably my original program creates such a context as a side effect of using OpenGL. Otherwise, the code behaves exactly as the original does. Ive built the code with Visual Studio 2013.

So far i have the login with php , then id have to make the website which is easy , what im having difficulties with is checking for movies purchased, and how to embbed a player to play that movie  assuming the movies are stored on the server.p  pSo , any ideas as to how could i do that Im also going to have a backend for admins to add movies , i could have the movie name in mysql then in the web just a script pointing to the name , that streams the file with that name hosted on the webserver.p

Positive 22279 pbrFirstly, Im not sure if the title is clear enough. I just try to explain what happens to me and what Im trying to do. br Im trying to detect the direct link of media files films, videos, etc... from some website by using Firebug Firefox, Inspector Firefox or other tools in Chrome. I also tried with Wireshark. Its pretty easy for some website because I can see the direct link from the request and by using programs like Quicktime, I can save the file to my local disk. For some other websites, I can see requests for streaming media content. However, the problem is that for the same file, there are many requests. It seems that after each several seconds, they use a different request to load, say 1.5Mb. When I copy one detected link to the address bar, the browser downloads a small file media type, but the file cannot be played. Following is one example for using multiple requests for a same videop  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7Ay6N.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7Ay6N.png altenter image description hereap  pMy questions are br How can they decompose the video content into multiple requests How can they accumulate the responses What kind of Protocol used From Wireshark, its TCP stream, but Im not sure if it correct because I read somewhere that rtmp is common. I watched a video on YouTube about rtmpdump but it isnt applicable in this case in the attached image br Is there any client tool that can help us to accumulate multiple media responses brThank you very much.p

Positive 22279 pIm trying to play video files on iOS from CC3200 using Socket communication. CC3200 is simple wifi device. So I read the video file on SD card using CC3200 In my case, the CC3200  is not able to add the Video Codec feature. So I sent directly the video files as a data to iOS without any codec. Therefore, in iOS, I can get only file data from CC3200. Of course, when I received all file data from CC3200, I can play the video on iOS. But Id like to play the video file like streaming while the file is receiving from CC3200. So I tried to find the way on internet, but I cant find any way at all. Is it possible to implement my idea Or is there another way to do so Thank you for your attention.p

Negative 22279 pI have been given a small project by the company I have applied for. They want a small application using asp.net codeGridViewcode, codeFormViewcode and an codeObjectDataSourcecode with a DataSet xsd file. I have been doing 3tier applications but in a different way, I have my DataAccess layer as a c sharp file with methods accepting params and returning datatables etc. My business layer is another class with static methods returning business objects and collections making use of the DAL class. Now this codeObjectDataSourcecode is sth i did not really like, its generating some code that i cant even see wherep  pI could make the application work upto some point90. The other 10 is what my question about. I need to make a search by name functionality. There are two ObjectDataSources 1 and 2. codeObjectDatasource1code just gets every record from the table on the first load. When search button cliked I set the datasource of gridview to the second codeObjectDataSourcecode which has a method called codeGetDataByNameSearchcode that is supposed to accept a parameter all defined by wizzzardz and parameter source is control codeTextBox.Textcode. While my codeFormViewcode works fine where it gets its parameter from codeQueryStringcode, this search returns nothing. Search statement is as followsp  precodeSELECT     Birthday, CreatedAt, ID, Name, Surname FROM         Users WHERE     Name LIKE name OR                       Surname LIKE name codepre  pAny idea about how these ObjectDataSources are supposed to be used, and make life easierp
Negative 22279 pYes, the title doesnt make much sense, but heres my situation.p  pI have two interfaces, say IGen and ITrans. Some of my classes implement IGen, some implement ITrans and some implement bothp  pITrans has one method Translate and IGen has one method Generate. For the classes that implement both ITrans and IGen Generate simply calls Translate.p  pI also have an Interface IGenAndTrans which is simply defined as p  precodepublic interface IGenAndTrans  IGen , ITrans           codepre  pAnd I have a class call it Holder which has IGenAndTrans as a property.p  precode[Serializable] lt Problem public class Holder      public IGenAndTrans GeneratorAndTranslator  get set  codepre  pNow, I want to mark the class Holder with [SerializableAttribute] and use the XmlSerializer. However I cant do this because Holder has a property which is an interface. Normally the recommended approach would be to make IGenAndTrans an abstract base class and use XmlInclude. Ive done this successfully in the past.p  pHowever Im unsure of how to do that in this case. Because a lot of my classes implement both IGen and ITrans they cant simply inherit from an abstract base class. This would mean I would need to split each of those classes into two classes with the corresponding duplication of code since Generate calls Translate a lot of the timep  pAny recommendations if Ive managed to explain myself well enough Maybe Im too close to the code and should be implementing it differently.p

COMPADD R1, R1, 0 Check for equality      BRZ WHILEEND      ...            code inside the while loop      JMP COMP       Return to while loop WHILEEND      ... codepre  pSo, in this while loop example I have used 1 label for the subroutine and 2 more for the loop itself.  Ive run out of good label names for all the loops and branches Im doing in assembly, what do you guys do to keep it varied and descriptivep
Negative 22279 pIve got a problem with a belongsTo relationship in CakePHP.p  pIve got an Action model that uses the actions table and belongs to one of two other models, either Transaction or Tag. The idea being that whenever a user completes a transaction or adds a tag, the action model is created to keep a log of it. Ive got that part working, whenever a Transaction or Tag is saved, the aftersave method also adds an Action record. The problem comes when I try to do a findall on the Action model, the related Transaction or Tag record is not being returned.p  pactionsp  precodeid model modelid created codepre  pI thought I could use the conditions parameter in the belongsTo relationship like thisp  precodeltphp class Action extends AppModel   var name  Action var actsAs  arrayContainable var belongsTo  array     Transaction gt array         foreignKey gt modelid,         conditions gt arrayAction.modelgtTransaction     ,     User gt array         fields gt arrayUser.username      ,     Recommendation gt array         conditions gt arrayAction.modelgtRecommendation,         foreignKey gt modelid          gt codepre  pBut that doesnt work.p  pAm I missing something here, are my relationships wrong I suspect so After Googling this problem I cam across something called a hrefhttpbakery.cakephp.orgarticlesviewpolymorphicbehavior relnofollowPolymorphic Behavioura but Im not sure this will help me.p

Negative 22279 pI have a number of objects collected in an array. The same objects are also attached to certain DOM elements for various reasons. From time to time I need to update one of these objects. The easiest way to do this is to find the object in the array with the same id property as the one I got new values for through AJAX and then replace it. But this of course creates a new object and the objects attached to DOM elements are no longer the same. Which means that if I would compare them they would not be the same object anymore.p  pHow can I easiest replace the correct object with the values in the new object without replacing the actual object So that the reference remains the samep  pExample of what I dont wantp  precodevar values  [id1, nameBob, id2, nameAlice, id3, nameCharlie] var bar  values[2] console.infobar  values[0]  True  var newValue  id1, nameDave  Somehow find the index of the object with id3 values[2]  newValue console.infobar  values[2]  False, should still be true codepre  pOnly way I can think of is looping through the object with a foreach or something, but hoping there is something builtin to javascript or jQuery or something that allows for more efficient or at least cleaner code.p

Negative 22279 pThis question actually has two parts.p  pThe first partp  pIve been developing my first app for a couple of weeks now. I have 5 screens and everything seems well. However, Im considering changing the apps navigation to a TabView.p  pI havent delved much into it, but Im hoping someone can save me a little bit of time. It seems that people dont generally place Activities inside each tab. They simply point the tab content to a View. This is where my major setbacks are. 1 I already have Activity classes full of code and 2 I cant quickly guess how the structure of an app using TabView looks. For example, where do I put the handler code for clicking a button on a View Does it all just get dumped into the TabView Activity somehowp  pWhat I would like is if you could please give me a quick synopsis of what Im looking at doing, answers to any questions you think I may have, and point me toward some resources for creating TabView applications. A quick Google search really just shows me how to create a TabView Activity and add a couple tabs to it. The code doesnt go any deeper.  For example, say I have a layout xml to show in one of my tabs content pane, where does the code go for clicking a button I have in that layoutp  pThe second partp  pIve added a TabActivity to wrap the Activities I currently have in.  At the moment I have Activities populating the content of my tabs though ultimately Id like to do this in the most efficient fashion, which doesnt seem to be having Activities be tab content. Ive noticed something rather annoying. My MAIN Activity is an Activity I wrote for my user to log in to their account. After logging in, they are taken to my Tab Activity. Here is what happensp  pWhen I am on my Tab Activity and I minimize the app by clicking the Home button and then launch it again, I dont get taken back to the Tab Activity. I get taken to my log in Activity. Why I dont have the launchMode of my Tab Activity set to singleInstance... or is it singleInstance by default How can I make the app relaunch showing the Tab Activity ideally by setting some parameter, assuming Im doing something wrong, and not having to save this data off somewhere and reading it and programmatically telling it what to go top  pThank you for all your time and helpp
Negative 22279 pIm building an application with several codeConnectorcode classes that interface with varied data silos. For an example, see an earlier question of mine a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3241094encapsulatinganexpensiveresourcewithoutusingasingletonherea. Anyways, as is the case in my example, almost all of these data sources are expensive timewise on access, so each codeConnectorcode maintains a cache to limit accesses. For every data silo, there is an codeIDataSourcecode that fetches data, and a codeConnectorcode that caches. The codeConnectorcode is accessed by passing in an codeIDataSourcecode to a factory method on my codeAppFactorycode class. p  pUnfortunately, there is exactly 1 codeConnectorcode that does not fit this model. The Active Directory silo is fast enough to not need a cache, so there is no need for an codeActiveDirectoryConnectorcode, nor would there be a factory method on my codeAppFactorycode class. As I said before, in EVERY other case, data is requested from a codeConnectorcode object, which can only be gotten from a method call to the codeAppFactorycode with an codeIDataSourcecode parameter.p  pAs far as I can tell, my options are to have a shallow codeActiveDirectoryConnectorcode object that just forwards requests straight to its codeIActiveDirectoryDataSourcecode, or to not have an codeActiveDirectoryConnectorcode at all. In the former case, I maintain conceptual integrity with the rest of my codeConnectorcodes, but I have a useless level of indirection. In the latter, I sacrifice conceptual integrity for directness. Which is the lesser evilp

Negative 22279 pI developed a medium sized MS Access application back in 2004. Over the years it has grown old and my small bugfixes and improvements dont cut it anymore.p  pI always hear people yammering about how bad Access is and how it is not modern yadda,yadda. Im quite happy with it and it does what it is supposed to do Provide a stable frontend for a simple database.p  pMy application uses lots of custom forms with subforms and lots of VBA code to do this and that. The most important part of the application is actually to provide the data for Word Mail Merges and to print badges and other material for a conference via Access reports. And exactly this printing integration is why I cant think of any alternatives.br Any web based solution will be a hassle to create nice looking reports or at least not with the easy of Access  create pixel perfect layouts and mold them into PDFs, direct printing FTW. Any Windows Forms application will take long to develop and ultimately I would just be recreating functionality of MS Access e.g. together with SSRS.p  pCan you think of any alternatives I have missed I am basically just looking for ideas.p
Negative 22279 pI have a Visual Studio solution with a Silverlight project, and a web project which hosts the Silverlight app. The web project also contains an ASMX web service which is called by the Silverlight ap.p  pAs described below, certain calls to the web service work fine, and yet others cause a CommunicationException to be thrown, wrapping a WebException  both with the message The server returned the following error not found.p  pFirstly, heres my original method, which failed as described above entity names changed for simplicityp  precode[WebMethod] public Customer GetCustomerint id      CustomerDataContext dc  new CustomerDataContext     return dc.Customers.SingleOrDefaultx gt x.Id  id  codepre  pSecondly, to debug the problem I took Linq to SQL and the database out of the picture, and the below code worked finep  precode    [WebMethod] public Customer GetCustomerint id      Customer c  new Customer  ID1, NameBob, History  new EntitySetltCustomerHistorygt      return c  codepre  pThird, thinking about this, one difference between the two methods is that the first one would include values in the customer history.

Negative 22279 pIve dabbled with genetic algorithms twice before, a hello world tutorial and a tsp solver. I tried to replicate the hello world tutorial in haskell, and see how the two compare speed wise. The haskell implementation is considerably slower, but what irks me is that the C version converges a lot faster around 40 generations without any mutation. The haskell version has AFAIK a better mate function leans to the better side of the population and converges in around 60 generations but only if there is mutation involved. Without mutation it stops at a local maxima very soon.p  pThe haskell version has a better mate function, but requires mutation to even converge The C version has no mutation and worse mate function but converges faster.p  precoderandomSt  RandomGen g, Random a gt State g a randomSt  state random randomRSt  RandomGen g, Random a gt a, a gt State g a randomRSt  state . randomR wrandomRSt  RandomGen g gt Int gt State g Int wrandomRSt n    let s  liftM2  randomRSt 0.0, 1.0 randomRSt 0.0, 1.0  RandomGen g gt State g Float       n  fromIntegral n   in liftM flip div 2 . floor . abs . subtract n  2 . n  s  mateCopy  RandomGen g gt StringVector gt State g StringVector mateCopy xs  V.replicateM population step xs   where     step  RandomGen g gt StringVector gt State g Vector Char     step xs        let mom  liftM xs  randomRSt 0,population div 2           dad  liftM xs  randomRSt 0,population div 2           split  randomRSt 0, V.length target  1       in do         m lt mom         d lt dad         s lt split         return V.take s m V.

Negative 22279 pIs there any software that acts as an intersection between contemporary OWLRDF reasoners, and the older a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSTRIPS relnofollowSTRIPSastyle automated planners and schedulers Both systems make use of RETEbased pattern matching, but only the automated planners seem to formalise the concept of an action. Unfortunately, all the projects Ive found that implemented automated planning, like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGraphplan relnofollowGraphplana or a hrefhttpsitemaker.umich.edusoarhome relnofollowSOARa, seem to be dead or dying, and never seemed to scale well to begin with. Current data stores are implemented on RDMS and can scale to and reason over millions of triples, but I havent found any that specifically try and reason over actions. I can envision how the concept of actions might be represented in traditional RDF, but Im sure it would still be very complicated and hackish without official support. Unfortunately, I cant find much prior art. Has this been done beforep

Negative 22279 pI develop on my local machine with VS2010 and SQL Server.  Naturally, my web.config points to my local SQL Server and I can debugdevelopment and all is well.  Unfortunately, I am not entirely sure on how to go about deploying my code to a live server.  p  pCurrently, my live server consists of a virtual machine my site is accessible from the internet.  When Im ready to put my changes on the live server I publish my app right click on solution explorer  publish.  Then I go to the directory it publishes to and dump all the files into a network share that goes to my site on the live server.  On the initial copy over, I have to manually edit the web.config so that the connection string points to the SQL Server on the live server instead of my local machine.  So this is my first stumbling block.  How can I easily manage development settings and live settings in the web.configp  pNow, I also use version control Kiln.  Can I possibly tag a changeset and have it automatically deployed to my live server somehow  Lets say someone submits a bug and I fix it.  I push my changeset and now Kiln has the latest version of my code with the bug fix.  Whats the best way to get these changes on to a live serverp  pIm unable to find any documentation that covers the entire workflow but I feel like there has go to be a better way.  Surely, something like this can be accomplished without having to manually edit the web.config everytime I publish and pray to the computer Gods that I didnt miss something in the connection string.p  pIts just me so I have complete control over all of my environments, including the server and whats accessible via the internet, and anything is possible if only I knew what to do.p

Negative 22279 pI am planning a Web Application and I am currently evaluating Frameworks. I have done a lot with Ruby on Rails in the past, but since this app will rely on a lot of code already written in Java and will run on an Application Server infrastructure, it will be in Java, too. p  pSo far I looked at several Frameworks and Spring MVC 3.0 looks the most promising for what Ive planned. I like how many concepts are similar compared to Rails front controller, push views and restful URLs.p  pHowever, I am still unsure about the view part. I want to be able to have one or more application templates that have the basic structure of my website, with logo, footer etc. This template will have some dynamic areas, such as a navigation section etc. in Rails speek, yield navigation Some of the view code, especially forms will be reused thats why something like partials would be nice, too. p  pMy frontpage might look like this  p  precode  Application.tmlp                                                       index.tmpl                                                                                         loginpartial.tmpl                                                                                                              codepre  pSo far I found Velocity, Freemarker and Tiles, but I am still unsure which one fits my need best. I like the template concept because I would like some designer to create the templates. p  pSomething that would also be nice but is not as important as the template concept, are automatically created links like the linkto helper from rails p  precodelinkto Profile, controller gt profiles, action gt show, id gt profile codepre  pWhich View implementation for Spring MVC comes closest to this Thanks a lotp

Negative 22279 pIm sorry about the title Im just not sure how to describe this one.p  pBasically Im using JQUERYajax to invoke a php script to validate some input and get some data. The returned data is encoded JSON, so i set the datatype to JSON in JQUERY and it returns an object.p  pI have just discovered that under certain it has to be said unusual conditions where a network connection is not responding in an expected way, the ajax call invokes the error option in JQUERY.p  pIn most cases I have an error message coming back from the server, but sometimes the error is reached and no JSON has been sent back from the server side script. I havent tracked down exactly what can provoke that network situation yet, but in any case I thought Id just deal with it back in Javascript whilst I dont yet know.p  pThe idea was to check to see if the expected object had been created, and if not then create it with the two expected properties and run a dialogue. This way Id avoid repeating writing the error messages. Its not a big saving, but I wanted to try the principle.  p  precode .ajax       url getmetadata.php,       type POST,       data entereddata,       dataType json,       timeout 7000, wait 7 seconds          error functiondata                       handle errors         ifdata                    Do nothing error message will be issued from the data object          else                      no message was returned. Some other error occured.             function tempdata                                this.errortitle    Error title                 this.errormessage  Error text                           var data  new tempdata                      issue error message         runDialoguedata.errortitle,data.errormessage          , ERROR          success functiondata                     SUCCESS   AJAX codepre  pin the code above, the data object should either exist or not before the if statement. And when I get to the runDialogue the object data should always exist in order to pass the errortitle and errordescription properties. p  pWhen the data object exists, there is no problem. What isnt working is when the data object does not exist, ie if fails the if test. The else should create the object data but doesnt. p  pWhat have i done wrong  p

If there is more than one item in the array xCode throws an unrecognized selector exception...p  blockquote   p[NSDate caseInsensitiveCompare] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x4f66dd0p blockquote  pI believe that this is because the objects in the array are NSDates.

Negative 22279 pOk I seem to always solve the issue of casting Boolean types when using LINQ to DataSets, but it seems like each new resultset brings a new problem.  So take a look at the following line which is populating a Boolean property on an object using LINQp  precode.IsActive  Iffd.IsNullIsActive, False, fd.FieldOf BooleanIsActive codepre  pI have also had emsomeem success with the followingp  precode.IsActive  Iffd.FieldOf IntegerIsActive.HasValue, fd.FieldOf IntegerIsActive, False codepre  pThis time neither approach worked. The IsActive type in the Database is of type strongbitstrong and in the DataSet, all records returned have either a 0 or 1 as their value. Regardless I am getting the following errorp  pemSpecified cast is not valid. When casting from a number, the value must be a number less than infinity.emp  pI would like to understand what I am doing incorrectly here. Can anyone explain how I emshouldem be casting this Thanksp

Negative 22279 pAfternoon. I am currently working a drink search site and started work on adding social media to the search results and detail pages. After a user enters in their search criteria and the results are returned, I have added FB Facebook and TW Twitter buttons for each result, this way the user can Like or Tweet directly from the results page. However I ran into an issue, the FB and TW links are to the right of every result and I have a skyscraper ad about 10px to the right of the results, so when a user clicks on FB Like, the popup appears behind the ad. Obviously this wont work as it is against Googles TOS to render popups over their Ads, so it got me thinking, there are two ways I can handle thisp  ol lipRemove the social media links from the results page and render them only on the detail page. I feel the page load impact of rendering social media links, for every result, is limited, as my pagination is currently set to 15 results per page and the JS is asynchronous.pli lipRevisit the UI to move the social icons elsewhere so when a user clicks FB Like, the popup isnt obscuring any Ads.pli ol  pWanted to pose this question to the SO community to see if anyone else has come across this issue before and what they ended up doing to resolve it.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 22279 pIn my app I have something similar in appearance to labels in GMail app UI. For those who may not know, they look like this labels are these colorful bars img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3RQKm.jpg altGmail screenshotp  pIn order to achieve similar effect I use ninepatch drawables  for each label I am creating a TextView and assign drawable to it. This is simple solution, but I dont like it. Its not elegant, it is quite slow as shown by profiler, and I just dont think its the right way to do it.p  pI changed the design of the UI to make it more ICSy, so I removed rounded corners from the labels. And I started thinking how I could replace 9patch solution. The most obvious thing is to use BackgroundColorSpan. But it has one, small drawback. I want my labels to have some padding. With drawables, it was easy to achieve. With spans, its harder. To make horizontal padding, I can just add spaces at the beginning and at the end of the string. But how to make vertical padding larger To clear things up, this is a screenshot of the label with BackgroundColorSpanp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKNKyr.png altenter image description herep  pI want to make the colored parts above and below the text larger.

Negative 22279 pI recently implemented a security mechanism for Linux which hooks into system calls. Now I have to measure the overhead caused by it.

The main goal is to show the overhead in different types of tasks CPU bound, IO bound etc.p  pThe question is how to organise the test so that they will be reliable The first important thing is the fact that my mechanism works only in kernel space, so it is relevant to compare systime. I can use time command for it, but is it the most accurate way of measuring systime Another idea is to run those apps in long loops to minimize error. Then the loops should be inside or outside time command If they are outside I will get many results  should I choose min, max, median, averagep  pThanks for any suggestions.p

Negative 22279 pIm building a Picture Loader which has two major abilities 1 Loading pictures in a thread, and 2 Saving cached images. Since I implemented a hrefhttpwww.simdesign.nlnativejpg.html relnofollowNativeJpg 1.32a, I have been noticing that a codeTsdJpgGraphiccode uses approximately 3 times as much memory as the codeTJpegImagecode. Im not concerned about resolving how much it reserves, but rather to make sure my threads manage the memory properly.p  pstrongSpecificationsstrongp  pcodeTPictureLoadercode is the main component for this system. Every time a picture needs to be loaded, a thread is spawned to acquire that image. When the image is available, an event is triggered providing this image in the form of a codeTBitmapcode. Component has a queue, and a limitation of how many threads can be active at once via codeActiveThreadscode property. Every picture requested immediately creates a thread  but the thread is not executed until necessary. codeActiveThreadscode determines how many of these threads can run at a time otherwise, how many pictures can be loaded at a time.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pcodeTJpegImagecode always loads the pictures fine with no errors. But, using a global conditional, I enable the use of NativeJpg codeTsdJpgGraphiccode and I have memory problems. The error message is codeNot enough storage is available to process this commandcode. This error is raised only internally in debug, and actually does not show any error when the app is running standalone. It doesnt go to any breakpoint in my code, but rather in the codeNativeJpgcode unit on line 460 codeFBitmap  SetBitmapFromIteratorAIteratorcodep  pUsing the standard codeTJpegImagecode, I never have problems with memory. Whether I load the picture once and then clear it from the memory, or load the picture once and save it somewhere in the memory, either way doesnt seem to make a difference. strongThe strange thing is that my memory just about maxes out using codeTJpegImagecode yet never raises any error, but when using a codeTsdJpgGraphiccode, the memory barely nudges at all and it already starts spitting out these errors.strongp  pWhen analyzing the memory usage, Im seeing this...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combbuYc.png altenter image description herep  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow do I avoid this error in any situation This system will be used in many environments, many of which will be very sluggish computers. Especially since Im working with multithreading here, memory usage is critical.p  pstrongSource codestrongp  precodeunit PictureLoader  interface  DEFINE USEJPG   DEFINE USENATIVEJPG lt DEFINE USEPNG

Negative 22279 pAlright Im pretty new to programming and stuff and Im now trying to code some basic programs in c. p  pNow Im basically working on a little thing thats basically a DLL that allows anyone to use the program as long as the program specifies and no longer.p  pIve already kinda figured out how ill do the code, ill do some checks and then either return true or false to the exe if the beta is still valid or not. But I dont really know how DLLs work completely, I know that theres programs that can kinda look into DLL code. So heres my questionsp  ul liCouldnt someone just change or rip off the source code and change the value to always be true and if they could, is there any way to prevent thisli liHow do you actually properly debug a DLL file Now Im just writing the code in an exe which I plan to later move to a DLL, but that cant be right.li ul  pAlso any other tips are welcome.

Negative 22279 pIm really hoping someone can help me with this.  I have a number of product attribute types that users can select from to refine the products that are returned to them on screen. What Im trying to do is, for each product attribute type, I want to list all attributes that relate to either the selected category or search term, then once theyve made their selections, I still want to display each of the attributes that relate to the category or search term, but only display a clickable link if the product count for that particular attribute is greater than 1 and for those that have a product count of zero, I want to list them, but make them unclickable. An example of what Im trying to achieve can be found on the ASOS website, in the left hand menu  a hrefhttpwww.asos.comWomenDressesCatpgecategory.aspxcid8799stateRf9613D33402C334140Rf2003D20ampparentIDRf300amppge0amppgeSize20ampsort1 relnofollowhttpwww.asos.comWomenDressesCatpgecategory.aspxcid8799stateRf9613D33402C334140Rf2003D20ampparentIDRf300amppge0amppgeSize20ampsort1ap  pInitially I tried using just joins to achieve this, but I wasnt able to do it, successfully.  So I decided to create a temporary table for each attribute type which held a list of all the attributes that related to the main query and then created a refined query, with a left join.  Heres my codep  precodeCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temptable      SELECT sutypes.id, type AS item FROM sutypes      INNER JOIN sutyperefs ON sutypes.idsutyperefs.id      INNER JOIN supref ON sutyperefs.mykey  supref.mykey  WHERE wpcategoryid 40 GROUP BY sutyperefs.id  sudbgtqueryquery  if sudbgtaffectedrows gt 0        SELECT temptable.id,item,COUNTsutyperefs.mykey AS productcount FROM temptable      LEFT JOIN sutyperefs ON temptable.idsutyperefs.id      LEFT JOIN supref ON sutyperefs.mykey  supref.mykey      LEFT JOIN sustylerefs ON supref.mykey  sustylerefs.mykey      LEFT JOIN suproductrefs ON supref.mykey  suproductrefs.mykey WHERE wpcategoryid 40 AND sustylerefs.id in 91 AND suproductrefs.id in 54 AND sutyperefs.id in 159 GROUP BY sutyperefs.id  if itemresults  sudbgtqueryquery       whileitemresult  itemresultsgtfetcharrayMYSQLIASSOC      iditemresult[id]     itemitemresult[item]     productcountitemresult[productcount]           buildlinklisttype, item, productcount, id       codepre  pIn the above example the first query selects all the product types that relate to a particular category, say dresses. And the second query is based on the refinements the user has made on the category, in this example this is product, product type and style. A user can also refine their search by colour, fit, fabric and design.p  pThere are a couple of issues with thisp  p1 The number of results returned in the second query do not match the results of the first.  Using the above as an example, I wish to list all products that relate to the chosen category, then using the second query return the product count for each of these products as I described above.  So if the temporary table returns, trousers, jeans and skirts.  I expected these three items to be displayed on screen based on the conditions applied in the second query, however my results may only show trousers and jeans, if there is not a match for skirts in the second query.  I thought that using a left join would mean that all the results of the temporary table would be displayed.p  p2Also I wonder if Im doing this the most efficient way.  I have a total of 8 attribute groups, and therefore need to do the above 8 times.  If the user choses to refine the results using all 8 attribute groups then in addition to the temp table join, there will be a total of 9 joins for each type.  Its taking a while to execute, is there a better way to do this  There are approximately 12 million products in the table, and this will probably be 5 times this, once my site goes live.p  pI really hope all that I have written makes sense and Id really appreciate the stackoverflow communitys help with this, if anyone can help. I apologise for the essay .  Thanks in advancep

Negative 22279 pI have a Java swing application that subscribes to a lot of data and displays this data in various ways. Under heavy load I have come to encounter that the JRE simply stops working with message JavaTM Platform SE binary has stopped working. This obviously shuts down my application and I need to restart it. I have tried to google for ways to troubleshoot this issue as I do not get a stacktrace in my code or anything that I can work with but I have found very little useful information beyond upgradingreinstalling the JRE and running virus scans. I have done both of these measures and rebooted the server but the problem still persists.

The observation that I have made is that the crashes appear to coincide with Garbage Collections.p  pThe issue is quite easy to reproduce and occurs after about 10 minutes of running the application. I do not run the application with any specific jvm parameters. The Java version is 1.6.031 was 25 before upgrade and I run on Windows 7 64bit.p  pIn the pic below from VisualVM the Java binary has just stopped working which appears to coincide with the GCrun. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comx63CJ.png altDump from Java VisualVMp  pAny help or ideas so that I can troubleshoot or remedy the problem is greatly appreciated.

Negative 22279 pI am sure this has been answered, but I am no programmer and couldnt findunderstand the appropriate answer. Suppose I have a massive class codebigcode for which would like to overload a binary operator, say codeoperator code. p  ol liIs there a sane way to make codebig XYZcode to build the sum directly into codeXcode, instead of  creating temporary object, copying it to codeXcode and then destroying the temporaryli liThe only thing that come into my mind is to wrap codebigcode into another class codesmallcode that will contain the pointer to codebigcode and add codeint usecode number of references to to big, so that codebigcode object get destroyed when codeuse0code. And add another assignment operator, say codeltcode for actual copying. I tried to implement it below. It seems to work, but  I have no experience and it is hard for me to foresee, what can go wrong.

DUMP AND LOADstrongp  pThe dumpandload strategy seems to be out of the question as my data is being updated behind the scenes this would have been my preferred approach as this is easily rolled back.p  pResult requires synchronising databases post release to get latest updates, TOO COMPLICATED.p  pstrong2. USE THE IMPORTERstrongp  pUsing the a hrefhttpwordpress.orgextendpluginswordpressimporterWPImporter plugina page and post IDs will get updated, screwing up styling that relies on the post IDs to get activated. This in turn creates a CSS nightmare that I wish to avoid, having to go though the CSS emafter releaseem to update the new pagepost IDs with the ones the database created.p  pResult Too finicky, not very professional approach leading to long and complex release process.p  pstrong3. UPDATE DATABASE MANUALLYstrongp  pThis option is great for small changes but when for more complex releases the list of steps to follow on the PROD interface becomes long and hard to follow, making it easy to make mistakes.p  pResult Too easy to screw up, only a last resort.p  pstrongIS THERE A STANDARD WORDPRESS RELEASE STRATEGY FOR EXISTING WEBSITESstrongp  pSo basically, my question is What release process do other wordpress developers follow when UPDATING an existing website Is there an option that I have not listed below that minimizes hassle and reduces time and complexity during release p  pIve set up source control for the site using GIT and I am used to automating things via ANT or similar release script, this may be overkill for the current project but would be ideal to at least know of a simple way to update a wordpress site and minimize the chances of screwing it up.p  pThanksp

So for every class bound to a combobox using this ItemContainerStyle Id have to implement a MainText and SubText property.  p  pQuestion is, is there a way to have the binding soft coded so where the style referenced from a combobox I can specify which string properties of the underlying class are used.p  precodeltStyle TargetTypexType ComboBoxItem  xKeyComboBoxItemStyleA1gt         ltSetter PropertyTemplate gt             ltSetter.Valuegt                 ltControlTemplate TargetTypeComboBoxItemgt                      ltBorder xNameBB Padding8,3,8,3 BackgroundDarkGreengt                         ltStackPanel Margin0gt                             ltTextBlock ForegroundWhite   FontSize16 TextBinding MainTextgt                             ltTextBlock ForegroundWhite   FontSize8 TextBinding SubTextgt                         ltStackPanelgt                     ltBordergt                         ltControlTemplate.Triggersgt                          ltTrigger PropertyIsSelected ValueTruegt                             ltSetter PropertyBackground TargetNameBB ValueFF256294gt                             ltSetter PropertyForeground ValueWhitegt                         ltTriggergt                     ltControlTemplate.Triggersgt                 ltControlTemplategt             ltSetter.Valuegt         ltSettergt     ltStylegt codepre  pAnd to use the style...p  precodeltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding Items      ItemContainerStyleStaticResource ComboBoxItemStyleA1 gt codepre  pFurther to dowhilefors answer many many thanks  WPF is great but sure is a voyage of discoveryp  pI used a data template to define the cell look originally  and then wanted to use a comboboxitem based style with a control template defined where I could specify the onmouseover triggers.  i.e. these were to change the background color etc. p  pButj  a I couldnt remove the Border section of the template above  the triggers are tied to it by targettypeBB.  so I kind of wanted to get the trigger bound to the container such that the datatemplate would pick up the background from the template binding but not sure how to get this plumbed in.   p  pb I realised that even if I comment out the BB specific bindings on the triggers just to get it to run  the combobox doesnt find and use the DataTemplate I defined. Seems that defining the controltemplate in my comboboxitemstyle stops it picking up the datatemplate.  p  pI hope I make sense here  bottom line is I just want a style that I can apply with triggers in that set the background color of my cobobox item.  It should not know what the data is  i.e. be able to plug in a datatemplate that will  template  bind to this background color.  p  pMany thanks for the very fast response.   p  pbtw Im using ItemContainerStyle in conjuction with ItemTemplate so I can have a different representation in the dropdown to what appears in the combobox listp
Negative 22279 pSo I was faced with yet another surprise problem when writing your application. I know that there ListFragment, but using a Fragment. When I put the markup for a fragment of a ListView, when you call the adapter in the list does not function adds elements  not a cunning way I tracked on the logs that you do not call getView . What is more interesting  if I do not use instead of just a list of the fragment and you add the adapter works well when everything  the list is filled. I can not understand why this is happening  why in the fragment list of works not adequate. p  pstrongactivitystart.xmlstrong  p  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid

Negative 22279 pMany of you know the original send will not write to the wire the amount of bytes you ask it to. Easily you can use a pointer and a loop to make sure your data is all sent.p  pHowever, I dont see how in WSASend and completion ports work in this case. It returns immediately and you have no control over how much was sent except in a lpLength which you have access in the routine. How does this get solvedp  pDo you have to call WSASend in the routine multiple times in order the get all the data out Doesnt this seem like a great disadvantage, especially if you want your data out in a particular order and multiple threads access the routinesp

Negative 22279 pIm working on a browser extension, wherein part of the feature is that a user can open an image from the browser  rightclick on the image, a context menu is shown  User clicks on a menu item which says Upload put there by my extension. Clicking that triggers my javascript code which gets the file path, because it will be the codesrccode property of the image loaded in the browser. Now that I have the file path, I want to upload this file to a server of the app. Obviously , this is a userapproved request because the user himself selected Upload from the menu, so no security breach.p  pMy idea was to create a codeFilecode object codeselectedFilecode with the obtained path then use something like codexhr.sendselectedFilecode to upload the file. That is how its done with the  HTML 5 File API. I however dont know how to create the file object from the path.

Negative 22279 pI am trying to print AFP to sysout but the FORMS parameter is not known and cannot be known by the JCL.  My current solution is to create dynamic JCL and spin it to INTRDR, but this is a weak solution because the job will not be under the control of our scheduler... and thus, an abend or other issue will go unnoticed by nighttime operators.p  pI started concocting a way to print the AFP via a COBOL program.  I use BPXWDYN to create the SYSOUT DD dynamically, which allows me to set the FORMS parameter however I want.  But the next step is dumping the AFP to that DD.p  pI thought I could call IEBGENER dynamically from my COBOL program, but that pulls a S0C4.p  pI can move the AFP records from one DD to the other in the COBOL program, but that limits me to one LRECL... and I have many different LRECL definitions for AFP throughout my system, and COBOL strongMUSTstrong know the LRECL at compile time.p  pAny thoughts  Is it possible to call IEBGENER dynamically and not get the S0C4  Any other ideas I havent thought ofp  pThanks in advance...p
Negative 22279 pPurely as a training exercise, i am manipulating a WebBrowser through WPF application I have written.p  pI am opening a URL a site that I do not own that contains many elements and one of which is a player with a video inside that loads when click on the button that is in the middle of the page with a very simple piece of code like sop  precodevar doc  webBrowser.Document as IHTMLDocument2                                                 doc.all.itemconfirm.Click codepre  pI am then also hiding some elements such as the header div container like sop  precodevar div  doc.all.itemfiletitle                                                 div.style.display  none codepre  pThis is working perfectly and launch the video and all BUT The scroll bars are annoying me and I can not seem to find a way to remove them from the WebBrowser.p  pI would also like to see if there is a way of extracting the player as a whole and not just extract the link as the player on the site is quite nice and the MediaElement in WPF just stinks when it comes to esthetics and it seems that VLCdotnet is not great when it comes to WPF. My thinking was to change the doc to ONLY contain the player and not any of the other elements of the page. Is this even doable p  pAnother way was to take the Flash player from the a hrefhttpflowplayer.org relnofollowhttpflowplayer.orga site and incorporate it as a UserControl in my application and just load the URL of the video but i do not know who that can be done. Or if it can be done.p
Negative 22279 pI am trying do the following in codeCcode and codeWPFcodep  pI have two windows called codeWindow1code and codeWindow2code. p  pcodeWindow1code is a control interface which receives data from different sources such as UDP, Database, or hand entry the data is then sent to codeWindow2code for display in codeText Boxescode. Lets say about 50 Text Boxes in total in codeWindow2code. I have a class codeDataSet1code created which contains 50 variables of differenty types codeInt16code, codeInt32code, codeDoublecode, codeStringcode, etc, etc.p  pcodeWindow2code has a local declaration of the the class codeDataSet1code contained in codeWindow1code. I want to collect the data in codeWindow1code and then assign it to codeWindow2code. This would be done something like codeWindow2.dataSet1  dataSet1code from within codeWindow1code. Upon receiving the new data, the TextBoxs in codeWindow2code need to update based on any that have changed or maybe just update all of them. p  pNow I know I can do 50 assignments within Window1 such as codeWindow2.TextBox1  dataSet1.Variable1.ToStringcode, codeWindow2.TextBox2  dataSet1.Variable2.ToStringcode, etc, etc. I just want to do this with one assignment statement which essentially copies the class variables from one window to the other.p  pI think I have to implement codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode but I do not know how to update multiple codeTextBoxescode on multiple field changes.p  pOK, Sounds like nobody can handle this one or I did not make myself clear so I am adding some code to try and illustrate.

Negative 22279 pIve written an licensing system, which checks different aspects of a license e.g. Start Date, End Date, System Restrictions etc.. In example I have an restriction in a license, which says you cant create more than 5 user accounts. I have a Method e.g. bool NumberOfUsersIsCoveredByLicense, which calls an common method e.g. bool IsValidLicense. IsValidLicense would check if the license file is manipulated, expired etc. p  pThe problem right now is the erroroutput. As you can see I have methods with a bool return value, so I know there was a license violation, but I dont know which part of the license check failed. So Im thinking about, how to return a value, which describes which part of the license was violated. The easiest way would be to return a string value, I would do something likep  precodevar licenseValidationResult  NumberOfUsersIsCoveredByLicense4 iflicenseValidationResult.EqualsString.Empty      Success  else      ErrorMessage  GetErrorMessageByErrorCodelicenseValidationResult  codepre  pSo if the license is valid I would return a empty string, if its invalid it would return the errorcodes in a form like error1error2error3.. Im actually not sure, if this is a good soulution. Another possibility would be a enumeration, something like thisp  precode[Flags] public enum LicenseErrorCodes      None  0x00,     LicenseExpired  0x01,     LicenseManipulated  0x02,     MaxNumberOfUsersReached  0x04,     [...]  codepre  pBut again, Im not sure if this would be a nice solution. Is there any common waybest practice to solve such a problemp

Negative 22279 pI have a panel that shows a 2D array of cells. Each cell is 32x32 pixels in a 100x100 cell grid. My panel is only big enough to display 45x30 cells. When I use the scrollbar, it updates the display moving cell by cell. The desired effect Im looking for is to move the horizontally or vertically by pixel, which would have a greater precision of movement. The end result would be if I clicked a scrollbars arrow button, instead of updating cell by cell, the panel will update pixel rowcolumn by rowcolumn. In other words, Im trying to get smooth scrolling 1 pixel rowcolumn at a time insteand of jerky scrolling 1 cell32 pixels at a time.p  pAny suggestions as to how this can be achieved p

Negative 22279 pIm currently looking into managing source code from an OpenInsight application using Git. Because OI code is stored in a database table there is a certain amount of manual work to export the source to text and visaversa.p  pSo far I have managed to automate a lot of this work using Git hooks, but the lack of a precheckout hook has given me a problem.. p  pWhen a user switches branches I have a postcheckout hook to diff the old and new branches and store a list of the changed procedures. When the user next starts OI the changes are pulled in from the text files and compiled.. so far so good.. However, if a user was to switch branches, let say from A to B, and then switch again to C without starting OI then the source in OI will be for branch A but the diff will be between B and C.p  pTo get around this I hoped to be able to use a precheckout hook to check for the existence of a file containing a list of uncompiled changes and stop the user switching branches until they were compiled in. Are there any other suggestions of ways of halting a checkoutp

Negative 22279 pIm currently testing the new Paypal REST API in PHP and it would appear that I have everything working just fine. However the company I am adding this support for is looking to drop their current Payment Gateway in favor of Paypal. This is where the problem exists.p  pCurrently all charges have occurred only on this other Payment Gateway. When they drop that Payment Gateway in favor of Paypal they will no doubtedly have customers who want to cancel services and based on company policy will receive a prorated refund.p  pSo here is my question. Is it even possible to issue a refund using the Paypal REST API Keep in mind, all charges are currently done without Paypal, so the Transaction IDs will not be found in Paypal. So I cannot associate an ID to Paypal to reference.p  pCurrently they only accept Credit Cards. Im lost at this point on a proper solution based on my question. The current Payment Gateway has a Credit option where it does not require a Transaction ID to be associated.p  pAny guidance would be helpful.p

In the web forms template, the UI usercontrol has a codeListViewcode that gets populated by way of this server method p  precode public IEnumerableltstringgt GetProviderNames              return Context.GetOwinContext.Authentication.GetExternalAuthenticationTypes.Selectt gt t.AuthenticationType      codepre  pwhere the property, codeAuthenticationTypecode, is the textual name of the provider, e.g. strongGooglestrong or strongFacebookstrong.

However I do not see how to provide the brandlogoimages srcurl that could be selected in the server method.  p  pIf I were to hack this, I would modify the codeGetProviderNamescode method where for each codeAuthenticationTypecode a lookup is done to get the image srcurl that could be used to populate the attributes of an image element in the UI html.

Negative 22279 pI have a decent sized code in python which I changed a bit and now I see that when executing the code, the script does not bail on language errors like missing function definitions.  I did not think it was possible to continue running a script with missing function definition. I used a function in one place with the intention of actually defining the function before running but forgot about it and ran the code. To my surprise I just got the following line printed to the console p  precodeWorker instance has no attribute updateparsestatus codepre  pWhere Worker is the class I was supposed to add the updateparsestatus call to.p  pI realized that I had a try and a generic catch all exception handler around the code in question like this p  precodetry     Worker.updateparsestatus except Exception as e     print e codepre  pSo python just throws a AttributeError and I was unknowingly catching it. It taught me a valuable lesson to not have catch all exception handlers. Also coming from a compiled language is there a better way to handle this I mean, can I some how make sure python just exits on language errors It will be very helpful to atleast weed out the obvious bugs though I understand that bad code got me into this situation.p

Negative 22279 pWe have a couple of large, mature apps installed in hundreds of medical clinics.  These apps are built using Windows Forms and WPF and although we host the database for some of them, the majority of our clients have a local install of the database.  p  pWe are in the planning stages of rebuilding our application on the ASP.NET MVC platform using Entity Framework.  We will also be rearchitecting our database, but for reference, the current database has about 600 tables and 1900 stored procedures. Although we dont have an official DBA, we have enough DBA skills to build and maintain what we have, so we are capable of designing and building the data model ourselves.  Also, we will continue to have both onpremise and hosted solutions.  p  pOur struggle is with deciding how to use EF.  Were all in agreement that we should use codefirst, but some of us think we should build our classes, decorate them with attributes, and allow EF to generate the database for us.  Others think we should design and build the database and then generate codefirst POCOs.  p  pAssuming we will have nonCRUD stored procs, triggers, views, stored procs, and user defined functions, is database generation a reasonable approach  Are there reasons why it might be the preferred approach  Any good reasons for avoiding it altogetherp

Negative 22279 pthis question is regarding estimates.p  pIf i were to develop frontend of a webapplicationJ2EE based,having around 50 JSPsHTML pages which would be having rich content significant number of tables, buttons, tabs etc. etc. and frequent ajax calls to server, what would be the over head in devlopment for IE7 as compared to other browsers say IE9, FF, chrome etc.p  pI know this is a very relative question and answer to this would depend upon lot of parameters, but still i would like to know that how extra effort it might need for a standard devlopment in IE 7 as compared to others I jsut need the high level info based on the experience of developers.p  pLets say on scale of 0 to 100 extra effortp  pAny thoughts are welcome.p

Negative 22279 pSo I have a point class that represents a point in ndimensional space, and a vector class that inherits from the point class and adds some extra functionality specific to vectors, such as dot products. I want the vector class to inherit the overloaded operators ,  unary,  binary, etc. from the parent point class. In the original python, I defined the codeaddcode operator as suchp  precodedef addself, other  should be same dimensionality     sum  self.class.zerosself.dimension     for i in rangeself.dimension         sum[i]  self[i]  other[i]     return sum codepre  pSo it takes self and another object presumably of the same type, calls a method of the class that generates another pointvector with the same number of dimensionscomponents and all values of zero, and then fills that pointvector with the added components and returns it. In the python, my vector class inherits this method as is from the point class, and there is no problem because it creates another object of the same class by using codeself.classcode to call zeros which itself calls the classes constructor with zero values for every argument. I have a C version, which looks like thisp  precodePoint operatorconst Point other const   dimensionality must match     vectorltlong doublegt newcompscomps.size, 0     for sizet i0 i lt comps.size i          newcomps.ati  comps.ati  other.comps.ati          return Pointnewcomps  codepre  pThe problem is that in the C, I used Point as the return type and called the constructor of the point class directly. Is there any equivalent to codeself.class.initcode in C More broadly, is there any way to write a member function like this operator so that it calls the constructor of the current class and returns on object of that type, so that the generic function can be inherited and work analogously for each class that inherits it Or is that sort of behavior not possible in C, or should I use a different technique composition instead of inheritance for this problem As it is, my vector class inherits from the point class and adds its own member functions just fine, but its  operator returns a point instead of a vector, which is problematic. To be clear, throughout this I have been referring to the mathematical object of a vector, no the C STL container of a vector, though I use that in my implementation.p

Negative 22279 pAfter searching for hours, I decided to ask this question here. For JSR82 bluetooth, there is an implementation called bluecove. However, the Mac OS version relies on a 32 bit VM the last time the library was updated was back in 2008. The problem is that newer JDK versions for the Mac do not support 32 bit anymore the d32 argument just gives me an error.p  pSo is there a possibility to get a 32 bit JVM for Mac OS Or are there other implementations for bluetooth that support 64 bit VMsp
Negative 22279 pWere using WebLogic 12.1.1. We have a Java client application that makes a call to an EJB that handles the business logic within a transaction, but on some requests, calls to another EJB service for additional data. This service EJB happens completely without transactions TransactionAttribute.NOTSUPPORTED.p  pWith this setup, we have an old development environment where this sequence of calls works, and now a new development environment where this sequence of calls fails with a javax.transaction.SystemException Timeout during commit processing. Ive carefully gone through the differences between the old and new environments and the only difference is that in the new environment, the domains Administration Port is turned on. Indeed, when I enable the Administration Port in the old environment, I get the same timeout exception.p  pstrongSo my question is this Why does enabling the administration port in a WebLogic domain cause changes in transaction behaviorstrongp

Negative 22279 pIn codeVolleycode library, the codeNetworkImageViewcode class requires an codeImageLoadercodethat handles all the image requests by searching for them inside an codeImageCachecodeimplementation, the user is free to choose how the cache should work, the location and the name of the images. p  pIm switching from codeVolleycodeto codeRetrofitcode, and for the images I decided to try codePicassocode.p  pWith the former library, I had a String parameter in each of my items containing the image URL, then I used codemyNetworkImageView.setImageUrlitem.getURLcode and it was able to determine if image was cached on disk. If the image existed in cache folder, the image was loaded, otherwise it was downloaded and loaded.p  pI would like to be able to do the same with Picasso, is it possible with codePicassocode APIs or should I code such feature by myselfp  pI was thinking to download the image to a folder the cache folder, and use codePicasso.withmContext.loadFile downloadedimagecode on completion. Is this the proper way or are there any best practices p

Say its a ecommerce site and therefore you have a product screen named products. p  pThis is not ideal for someone that wants to find the top products on their mobile app...as the screen name is simply Products. p  pIdeally you would want the actual product name in the screen views section of Google Analytics. The problem with this though is that it will look ugly across the top of the actual screen. Currently it says products across the top of the screen.p  pNow for the questionp  pIs there a way to pass the actual product name as the screen name but still present Product at the top of the screen when a user is viewing the app p  pIf so..I would love to know how so I can relay to my developer. p

Negative 22279 pIm starting out in Android and creating a basic todolist using codeListActivitycode. Essentially, every time an item an entry is clicked, the item is marked or unmarked in its corresponding codeSharedPreferencescode file. In addition, the corresponding codeTextViewcode is also slashed or unslashed using codesetPaintFlagscode, as followsp  precodeprotected void onListItemClickListView l, View v, int position, long id        super.onListItemClickl, v, position, id      SharedPreferences savedList  this.getPreferences0     String item  savedList.getStringposition  ,       if  item.containschecked             item  item.replacechecked,         SaveItemitem, position            TextViewv.setPaintFlags TextViewv.getPaintFlags amp  Paint.STRIKETHRUTEXTFLAG          else            item  checked  item         SaveItemitem,position         TextViewv.setPaintFlags TextViewv.getPaintFlags  Paint.STRIKETHRUTEXTFLAG              codepre  pThe checked here is just a string. In the codeOnCreatecode method, to read the codeSharedPreferencescode file to reload the items in the checklist, and for whichever ones have been marked, I would like, again, to strike it out, as followsp  precodefor int i  0 i     pos  i     listitems  savedList.getStringi,     if listitems.matches if first entry in saved file is empty, stop the loop         break          else iflistitems.containschecked         listitems.replacechecked,         listItems.addlistitems         adapter.notifyDataSetChanged              TextView textview  TextView getListView.getChildAti         textview.setPaintFlags textview.getPaintFlags  Paint.STRIKETHRUTEXTFLAG          else         listItems.addlistitems         adapter.notifyDataSetChanged       codepre  pThis doesnt seem to work, with two problems arising first, even though I am remove the checked from those that are checked, the item appearing in codeListViewcode still has a checked. And secondly, the strikes dont appear, leading me to believe that the corresponding codeTextViewcode hasnt been picked up.p  pEdit forgot to include something.p

Negative 22279 pSuppose I have a handler for a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.appdomain.assemblyresolve.aspxcodeAppDomain.AssemblyResolvecodea event, and in the handler I construct a byte array and invoke the method a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryh538bck7.aspxcodeAssembly.Loadbyte[]codea. Can this method itself cause the codeAssemblyResolvecode event to be raised again, and cause my handler to be reenteredp  pMy question is not restricted only to assemblies that can be generated using C compiler, they can contain abritrary metadata and executable code supported by the CLR.p  pI did some experiments and havent find any cases when it happens.

Negative 22279 pIm creating an audio project as an academic exercise  I want to use Ruby for a nonrails project. I came across the coreaudio gem here a hrefhttpsgithub.comnagachikarubycoreaudio relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnagachikarubycoreaudioa and thought it would be useful in playing back the audio Im creating. However, there are some basic things Im just not getting about this gem.p  p1 Is there any documentation I would be happy to volunteer to contribute to the project by writing documentation but Im afraid I lack the basic understanding to do so. I looked at the generated documentation here a hrefhttprubydoc.infogemscoreaudio relnofollowhttprubydoc.infogemscoreaudioa but thats only more mysterious. I would think that would at least show the method prototypes but I only see one method codeCoreAudioAudioFilereadcode. The examples have calls to other methods that dont show up here.p  p2 What are the available methods  is there an API The examples have things like codeCoreAudio.defaultinputdevice.inputbuffercode and codeCoreAudio.defaultoutputdevice.outputstreamcode, and by copying the examples I have been able to get some sound out through the codeCoreAudio.defaultoutputdevice.outputbuffercode. codedefaultinputdevicecode and codedefaultoutputdevicecode are instances of codeCoreAudioAudioDevicecode. This is awesome, but I dont know what codeCoreAudioAudioDevicecode is. p  p3 What is CoreAudioAudioDevice Having no more sophisticated tools at my disposal I grepped for the string AudioDevice in the installed gem files. I found a number of instances in the file extcoreaudio.m. The code looks like C and I think .m is a file suffix for a certain type of file in an Objective C project. The only place in that file where I see the string AudioDevice where it isnt part of a larger variable name eg rbcAudioDevice is in the comments, but Im guessing that this objective C code gets compiled into... I dont know what...p  p4 What are these Objective C files doing here Wheres the Ruby Shouldnt there be a file or files written in Ruby somewhere in this project that define the class CoreAudioAudioDevice The only .rb file on any appreciable size is libcoreaudioaudiofile.rb where the read method is defined, the only method shown in rdoc. p  p5 What is coreaudioext.bundle The gem installation process created a binary file called coreaudioext.bundle which, if I had to guess, would be the result of compiling the objective C files in the project. This file is required in libcoreaudiocoreaudio.rb, so must be significant to Ruby, but its a black box to me. I assume it is a black box containing the definition of the ephemeral CoreAudioAudioDevice. How would I know how to use this other than looking at the examples p  pPlease help me understand what Im missing. p

Should I fork again in the listener the actual applications that Im going to fire off or is this enoughp

Negative 22279 pIm having some issues applying TinyMCE onto the textarea element. I have a page with a list of passengers. When you click a passsenger, AJAX is called and it displays info for the passenger, one field which happens to be a textarea element. My problem is that the first passenger any passenger you click on loads TinyMCE, but from here on out, its just a normal textarea with no TinyMCE applied. I dont know whats happening. Here is the following code I havep  precodej  jQuery.noConflict jdocument.readyfunctione      tinyMCE.init         mode  textareas,         theme  advanced,         themeadvancedbuttons1  bold, italic, underline,  ,bullist, numlist,  ,outdent, indent,  ,link, unlink, , code,         relativeurls  false,         removescripthost  false,       j.names strong.clickfunctione      Find passenger ID     var customerID  jthis.closest.passengerContainer.findinput[namecustomerID].val     Find placement of returned data     var insertData  jthis.closest.passengerContainer.find.package      j.ajax                type POST,        url includepassengerDetail.php,        data  customerIDData  customerID ,        success functiondata              get returned data and add into appropriate place             insertData.htmldata              var oldEditor  tinyMCE.getnotes             if oldEditor  undefined                   tinymce.removeoldEditor                          tinyMCE.execCommandmceAddControl, false, notes             reinitialise WYSIWYG editor.

I have a sneaky suspicion bad coding practice is the culprit. Each of the textareas have an ID of notes which I think is the cause. But looking at documentation I dont think tinyMCE lets you use classes to target textareas. Unless I have to loop through all textareas. Im just spitballing here.p  pPlease inform me if more info is required. Thanks again.p

Negative 22279 pI am looking for an OpenSource project or a simplistic means to build my own service. I have several standardized Excel 2010 forms that individuals fill out. Once completed, the forms are emailed and archived and then later all the data from all the forms are combined into a single report. Works great.p  pThis is for remote users to be able to submit forms to me like travel requestexpenseetc. Right now they just email me.p  pI would like to, instead, have all the forms submitted to a service on my server that takes the needed data fields and stores in a database. Then would like to be able to create reports from that data. I imagine I would need to build a management console that pulls the submitted reports individually for an approval process and the ability to modify previously submitted forms. All my forms are uniquely identified via a random number generator already by the way.p  pHas anyone seen such a service in the opensource world and if no, what would be the best route to create such a thing. I am not even sure of what google keywords I need. So far I have been trying excel database service and such.p

Negative 22279 pI am implementing a Drag and Drop system for web in javascript, and my problem is this, due to reasons like I do the project can not use jquery UI to implement this Drag and Drop, I wonder if there is any script drag and drop that allows me to do the same or at least close to jquery UI or do you really think that jquery is my best option.p  pI tried with interactjs, a hrefhttpinteractjs.io relnofollowhttpinteractjs.ioa, but I could not understand how to implement the revert explicitly as this only works when you drag outside the container object draggable but not really return to the position initial, and also not find anything regarding the use of clones.p  pThis is very important because all the scripts of drag and drop with whom I have encountered which do not make use of jquery suffer from the same problem,and i could not understand how to solve and this is, functions revert and clone, these two characteristics are fundamental to what Im trying to do. p
Negative 22279 pI am trying to implement quicksort without recursion using a stack. The sort method is supposed to partition, and store the bounds of the sublists as arrays within the stack.

Negative 22279 pI am developing a mobile client on Android for web site. The site contains a big list of different items with images and technical characteristics. I want to know, which way is the best to show the content of the website for the user I have two ideas. 1. When the users opens the site for the first time, the client downloads all the images and data and then saves in the device memory folder  for images and SQLite Database  for nonimages. But what if there will be a lot of images and data, then this information will occupy a lot of space on the device and the user will have the duplicate of database which is also stored on the site. Is that good 2. Every time when the user is opening the mobile client all the information is downloading from the site and nothing is saved on device. In this case the work of the application will be very slow, because of the due to the constant connection to the site to download information. Can anyone give me advices of how to choose the best way to optimise the work of the applicationp

The remains of this extensive wood are still to be seen at the noble seats of Wentworth, of Warncliffe Park, and around Rotherham. Here haunted of yore the fabulous Dragon of Wantley here were fought many of the most desperate battles during the Civil Wars of the Roses and here also flourished in ancient times those bands of gallant outlaws, whose deeds have been rendered so popular in English song. Such being our chief scene, the date of our story refers to a period towards the end of the reign of Richard I., when his return from his long captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his despairing subjects, who were in the meantime subjected to every species of subordinate oppression. The nobles, whose power had become exorbitant during the reign of Stephen, and whom the prudence of Henry the Second had scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown, had now resumed their ancient license in its utmost extent despising the feeble interference of the English Council of State, fortifying their castles, increasing the number of their dependants, reducing all around them to a state of vassalage, and striving by every means in their power, to place themselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him to make a figure in the national convulsions which appeared to be impending.   codepre  pWhat am I missing here p
Negative 22279 pSorry for the long post, but I think it requires a bit of explanationp  pIm working on a site where we cant have open registration  so only approved users can log in. I thought I came up with a basic, but nifty, workflow where I upload the user email addresses via CSV, which sends them an email to create their password. The link directs them to the password reset form, which checks their email against the database and, if present, allows them to reset aka set their password.p  pTo do this I used a hrefhttpsgithub.combmihelacdjangoimportexport relnofollowdjangoimportexporta using the codeImportExportMixincode in my user admin to allow me to import djangomodel csvs. The thing is, it doesnt work. If I create a user via my admin panel, everything works fine, but if I upload users via the CSV, they get the first email but when they go to the site and enter their email into the password reset form, nothing happens. If I create the user manually, it works perfectly they get the initial email, go to the site, enter their email, and receive an email asking them to create their password.p  pI included the relevant models, admin, and views below.

Negative 22279 pa hrefhttpunicode.orgreportstr15StableCodePoints relnofollowUnicode Standard Annex 15a describes how each character in Unicode, for each of the four normalisation forms, has a QuickCheck value that aids in determining whether a given string is in that normalisation form.

When I do this it falls through and only reads the last string.  And when I add the timer calls, which are probably written wrong, it crashes the project.

I did little bit of more digging and checked gridviews actual code where is sets up number of columns.p  precode   declaration of vars     public static final int AUTOFIT  1     private int mNumColumns  AUTOFIT      private boolean determineColumnsint availableSpace          final int requestedHorizontalSpacing  mRequestedHorizontalSpacing         final int stretchMode  mStretchMode         final int requestedColumnWidth  mRequestedColumnWidth         boolean didNotInitiallyFit  false          if mRequestedNumColumns  AUTOFIT              if requestedColumnWidth gt 0                   Client told us to pick the number of columns                 mNumColumns  availableSpace  requestedHorizontalSpacing requestedColumnWidth  requestedHorizontalSpacing                  else                       Just make up a number if we dont have enough info                     mNumColumns  2                               else                   We picked the columns                 mNumColumns  mRequestedNumColumns                           if mNumColumns lt 0                  mNumColumns  1              codepre  pThis snippet only shows where mNumColumns value is set, for entire code you can see a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavaextcom.google.androidandroid5.0.2r1androidwidgetGridView.java relnofollowhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavaextcom.google.androidandroid5.0.2r1androidwidgetGridView.javaa , now theoretically mNumColumns can never get 1 except when view is not laid out.p  pstrongSo what should I do for this scenario , any suggestions strong I can either add delay worse case design or I can add a check for 1 and return 1 using idea of above code snippet which may cause race condition. Probably I am missing something or my assumptions are wrong.p

Negative 22279 pI have developed a web application with JQuery 1.11.2 and JQuery Mobile 1.4.5 in Java Server Pages. It was successfully deployed on Google App Engine.p  pThe web app is about to go live for our customers to use. The development has been all on IE 10, Firefox and Google Chrome. The deployed web app has already been successfully tested on those web browsers. We assumed that our customers were with the same OS and IE versions as us. However, they advised that they used IE 9 and found a few issues on the front end while initially testing the web app on their IE 9.p  pI initially thought it was just the IE9 Compatibility View issue. As I am with IE 10 I had to go back home and test the app with one of my old computers that is with IE 9. The front end issues were cleared when I changed to IE 9 Compatibility View, but I was unable to make JQuery AJAX calls The page styling seems fine and JQuery Mobile controls seem to work well except for Popup widget.p  pAs the web app heavily relies on JQuery AJAX to submit user data to the server. I am afraid I would have to reengine my code but I am feeling I have nowhere to go.

Negative 22279 pWould it be naive to create a TCP socket with a listen backlog set to minimum as a way of rate limiting new incoming connections The server workload in question doesnt expect many new connections at any time but spends a lot of time servicing long open persistent connections. It appears that new incoming connections shouldnt affect established connections, though Ive been unable to find any definitive answer in any text. Is it possible for failed new incoming connections to create some kind of TCP traffic congestion on the server with the packets its receiving or are they dropped fast enough that it has no effect on any buffers or other part of the network stack p  pSpecifically the platform in use is Linux, and although it may be handled differently in different OSs, I expect them to all behave roughly the same.p  pstrongEDITstrong What I mean by the same is that backlog doesnt affect established connections, though I do understand Linux discards them while Windows sends a reset.p

Negative 22279 pI am getting some strange errors when running my Java game. Ive been working on this game for weeks as a project for my computer science class and it is due on 642015, so I appreciate any help. Initially I wrote the game in a class called Game and ran it from a static method called run. Later, I decided to add a GUI menu in a class called Control. To run the game now, I call the main method in the Control class. This menu has a button with an action listener. When the button is clicked, the run method in the Game class is called. If I click and run the run method directly the game works fine. But if I click the button which calls the run method it draws a frame, but not the actual game.p  pHere is my code for the GUIp  precode    public class Control extends JFrame implements ActionListener        JPanel     public JPanel pnlButton  new JPanel       Buttons     public JButton btnAddFlight  new JButtonMultiplayer     public JButton single  new JButtonSingleplayer      public Control throws IOException,InterruptedException          superBouncy Ball         Set button size         btnAddFlight.setBounds150, 400, 220, 30         single.setBounds150,350,220,30           JPanel bounds         pnlButton.setBounds0, 0, 500, 500         pnlButton.setBackgroundColor.WHITE           Adding the Bouncy Ball logo to JPanel         String path  gg.jpg         File file  new Filepath         BufferedImage image  ImageIO.readfile         JLabel label  new JLabelnew ImageIconimage         label.setBounds179,50,150,150          Action Listener setup         single.addActionListenerthis          add buttons and title logo to JPanel         pnlButton.addbtnAddFlight         pnlButton.addlabel         pnlButton.addsingle          Set up and add the instructions to the JPanel         JLabel gg  new JLabelWelcome to Bouncy Ball, a game where you have to manipulate         gg.setFontnew FontSerif, Font.PLAIN, 18         gg.setBounds0,10,500,500         pnlButton.addgg         JLabel f  new JLabelthe window size with WASD to win Click the buttons to start.         f.setFontnew FontSerif, Font.PLAIN, 18         f.setBounds0,28,500,500         pnlButton.addf         pnlButton.setLayoutnull          Add JPanel to JFrame         this.addpnlButton           JFrame properties         setSize500, 500                setTitleBouncy Ball         setLocationRelativeTonull         setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         setVisibletrue           Override     public void actionPerformedActionEvent submitClicked          try             isClicked  true              Game.run                  catchInterruptedException a           public static void mainString[] args throws IOException,InterruptedException         new Control       codepre  pand here is the run method in my game classp  precodepublic static void run throws InterruptedException      Setting up JFrame     frame  new KeyFrameBouncy Ball     frame.setSize1000, 1000      Setting up Scanner and get user level input     Scanner scan  new Scanner System.in     System.out.printlnLevel one, two, three, or fourmust be an int, four is multiplayer     f  scan.nextInt      Display JFrame     frame.setVisibletrue     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     frame.toFront      Add Game JPanel     game  new Game     frame.addgame      Setting up game basics     b  new Ballgame,0,0,30,30     setUpLevel     objList.add0,b      Main Game Loop     while true          Request Focus         game.requestFocusInWindow          Update current Time         lastStartTime  System.currentTimeMillis          Move the ball and the player         p.move         b.move          Refresh JPanel         game.repaint         Thread.sleep10          Check if the player wins or loses         checkWin         checkLoss       codepre  pIf I call the run method directly it works, but not if I click the button in the GUI.

Then there is a Widget containing the game itself which has a lot of stuff and an update loop... it updates the player positions, checks for collisions with items  and on collision the item, here the shield, is registered as on in a gamefile. Then the updateloop checks that gamefile for the status of shields, sees they are on and should play the sound.p  pThe sound plays just fine, however the loop appears to halt until its finished playing the sound. Essentially, the players stop for a microsecond. How can I make the update loop not wait for the sounds to finish...p

Negative 22279 pFirst of all Im very new to Java and programming generally, so apologies if my question or attempts at solving it are naive.p  pIm trying to create a program which displays images, stored in an Open Document Text .odt document, in a Javax.Swing interface.  To that end I am trying to extract an image from an odt using Odf Toolkit.  Im sure there must be a way to do this as Odf Toolkit can insert images so surely it should be able to extract them toop  pHere is one of the ways I have tried to get the image out of the odtp  precode package odftoolkittrial   import java.util.Iterator  import org.odftoolkit.simple.TextDocument  import org.odftoolkit.simple.draw.Image          author      public class odftrial      param args the command line arguments   public static void mainString[] args   String filePath  Users.....imagetest6   Image allImages   try        TextDocument odt  TextDocument.loadDocumentfilePath        IteratorltImagegt ii  odt.getImageIterator               while ii.hasNext                     Image image  ip.next                  allImages  image.getImageContent                 System.out.printlnallImages                 catch Exception ex         ex.printStackTrace       codepre  pThis was adapted from code I have used successfully to extract text from an odt.  I can see two problems in that the methods I am trying to use do not exist in the classes to which their variables belong, but Ive spent days trying to find suitable methods or other ways of extracting the images and have drawn a blank.p  pIf anyone can offer any example code or even pointers Id be very grateful.  If I can get the images and save them to disc as jpegs or pngs, that would be fine, as I already have code which will take such an image, display it on a jlabel, and then delete it from the disc.p  pRegards and thanks in advancep
