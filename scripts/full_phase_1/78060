Negative 78060 pIve done several flash projects working as the actionscripter with a designer doing all the pretty things and animation.

Negative 78060 pIm currently working on a raytracer in C as a hobby project. Im trying to achieve a decent rendering speed by implementing some tricks from a c implementation and have run into a spot of trouble.p  pThe objects in the scenes which the raytracer renders are stored in a KdTree structure and the trees nodes are, in turn, stored in an array. The optimization Im having problems with is while trying to fit as many tree nodes as possible into a cache line. One means of doing this is for nodes to contain a pointer to the left child node only. It is then implicit that the right child follows directly after the left one in the array.p  pThe nodes are structs and during tree construction they are succesfully put into the array by a static memory manager class. When I begin to traverse the tree it, at first, seems to work just fine. Then at a point early in the rendering about the same place each time, the left child pointer of the root node is suddenly pointing at a null pointer. I have come to the conclusion that the garbage collecter has moved the structs as the array lies on the heap.p  pIve tried several things to pin the addresses in memory but none of them seems to last for the entire application lifetime as I need. The fixed keyword only seems to help during single method calls and declaring fixed arrays can only be done on simple types which a node isnt. Is there a good way to do this or am I just too far down the path of stuff C wasnt meant for.p  pBtw, changing to c, while perhaps the better choice for a high performance program, is not an option.p

Negative 78060 pIm building a communitybased site in Rails for the members of a realworld organization. Im trying to adhere to the best practices of RESTful design, and most of it is more or less bythebook. The issue thats making my brain run in neat RESTful circles is that of authorization. emAuthenticationem is an easy, longsolved problem with widelyaccepted RESTful solutions, but RESTful authorization seems to be a bit of a black art. Im trying to find the approach that will provide the most general and flexible framework for controlling access to resources while being as simple as possible, all while conforming to a RESTful architecture. Also, a pony.p  pConsiderationsp  ol liI need to control access to a variety of resources, such as Users, Pages, Posts, et cetera.li liAuthorization for a given resource must be finergrained than simple CRUD.li liI wish to allow myself and others to edit the authorization rules from within the application.li liAuthorization rules should be allowed to depend on predicates, such as conceptually OwnerUser, Resource or LockedTopicli ol  pConsideration 2 is the one that concerns me the most. There seems to be an impedance mismatch between my conception of permissions and the RESTful conception of actions. For example, take Posts as in a message board. REST dictates the existence of four operations on the Post resource Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Its simple to say that a user should be able to Update his own Posts, but only certain users or roles, or groups should be permitted to Lock them. The traditional way to represent locking is within the state of the Post, but that leads to the smell that a User under the same conditions may or may not be able to Update a Post depending on the completely valid values he supplies. It seems clear to me that there are really two different actions to change the state of the Post, and to shoehorn them is merely to disguise a violation of RESTful principles.p  pI should note that this problem is quite distinct from the problem of an Update failing due to eminvalid or inconsistentem dataa lock request from an unprivileged user is in principle quite valid, simply disallowed.p  blockquote   pemIsnt decomposition another word for rotemp blockquote  pThis may be overcome by decomposing the Post a Lock is a subresource of a particular post, and to Create or Destroy one may then have separate permissions. This solution has the ring of REST to it, but is brings with it both theoretical and practical difficulties. If I factor out locks, then what about other attributes Suppose I decide, in a fit of caprice, that only a member of Administrator should be allowed to modify the Posts title A simple change in authorization would then require a restructuring of the database to accommodate it This is not much of a solution. To allow for this kind of flexibility under a strategy of decomposition would require that every attribute be a resource. This presents a bit of a dilemma. My implicit assumption has been that a resource is represented in the database as a table. Under this assumption, a resource for every attribute means a table for every attribute. Clearly, this is not practical. However, to remove this assumption presents an impedance mismatch between tables and resources, which could open up its own can of worms. To use this approach would require far more indepth consideration than I have given it. For one thing, users reasonably expect to be able to edit multiple attributes at once. Where does the request go To the smallest resource that contains all attributes To each individual resource in parallel To the moonp  blockquote   pemSome of these things are not like the othersemp blockquote  pSuppose then that I do not decompose attributes. The alternative then seems to be defining a set of privileges for each resource. At this point, however, the homogeneity of REST is lost. In order to define access rules for a resource, the system must have specific knowledge of that resources capabilities. Furthermore, it is now impossible to generically propagate permissions to descendant resourceseven if a child resource had a privilege of the same name, theres no inherent semantic connection between the privileges. Defining a RESTlike set of standard privileges seems to me to be the worst of both worlds, so Is be stuck with a separate permissions hierarchy for each type of resource.p  blockquote   pemWell, we did do the nose. And the hat. But its a resourceemp blockquote  pOne suggestion Ive seen that mitigates some of the disadvantages of the above approach is to define permissions as createdelete on emresourcesem and readwrite on emattributesem. This system is a compromise between attributesasresources and privilegesperresource one is still left with only CRUD, but for the purposes of authorization, Read and Update pertain to attributes, which could be thought of as pseudoresources. This provides many of the practical benefits of the attributesasresources approach, although the conceptual integrity is, to a certain extent, compromised. Permissions could still propagate from resource to resource and from resource to pseudoresource, but never from a pseudoresource. I have not fully explored the ramifications of this strategy, but it seems as though it may be promising. It occurs to me that such a system would best function as an integral part of the Model. In Rails, for example, it could be a retrofit of codeActiveRecordcode. This seems rather drastic to me, but authorization is such a fundamental crosscutting concern that this may be justified.p  blockquote   pemOh, and dont forget about the ponyemp blockquote  pAll of this ignores the issue of predicative permissions. Obviously, a User should be able to edit his own Posts, but no one elses. Equally obviously, the adminwritten permissions table should not have separate records for each user. This is hardly an uncommon requirementthe trick is making it generic. I think that all of the functionality I need could be gained by making only the emrulesem predicative, so that the applicability of the rule could be decided quickly and immediately. A rule codeallow User write Post where AuthorUser, Postcode would translate to codefor all User, Post such that AuthorUser, Post, allow User write Postcode, and codedeny all write Post where LockedPostcode to codefor all Post such that LockedPost, deny all write Postcode. It would be emgrandem if all such predicates could be expressed in terms of one User and one Resource. The conceptually resultant final rules would be nonpredicative. This raises the question of how to implement such a system. The predicates should be members of the Model classes, but Im not sure how one could refer to them gracefully in the context of the rules. To do so safely would require some sort of reflection. Here again I have a feeling that this would require a retrofit of the Model implementation.p  blockquote   pemHow do you spell that againemp blockquote  pThe final question is how to best represent these authorization rules as data. A database table might do the trick, with enum columns for allowdeny and CRUD or perhaps CRUD bits or perhaps C, R, U, D  allow, deny, inherit, and a resource column with a path. Perhaps, as a convenience, an inherit bit. Im at a loss as far as predicates. Separate table Certainly lots of caching to prevent it from being emtooem ungodly slow.p  hr  pI guess that this is a lot to ask for. I tried to do my homework before asking the question, but at this point I really need an outside perspective. Id appreciate any input that any of yall might have on the problem.p

Why doesnt Oracle simply mention the NAME of the table or view which doesnt exist Why all the auditing and other complex solutions posted in the example questionp  pIn short Is there some rational, technical explanation for Oracles seemingly piss poor error feedback, or is this more likely the result of a lack of motivation on Oracles part to improve due to their almost monopolistic popularity status Or other Lack of coordination with ORM devs and DB vendorsp  pActually, this also begs the question of whether other competing particularly OSS DBs provide any better feedback, which I have no idea of really, so this may apply to more than just Oracle.p

If I open multiple windows, it ignores the additional windows. I think it is creating a server socket for each window, but since they are using the same port, the additional sockets fail to initialize. I need it to create a server socket when the browser launches and continue running when I close the windows Mac OS X. As it is, when I close a window but Firefox remains running, the socket closes and I have to restart firefox to get it up an running. How do I go about thatp

Negative 78060 pI am writing a decimal multiplier in C. The multiplier is implemented by taking two integers represented as vectors of digits. Each vector stores its digits in reverse order, for easier representation by powers of ten. For example, 3497  3  103  4  102  9  101  7 100 and is stored in a vector as 7, 9, 4, 3. Thus, each index of the vector represents that digits respective power of ten in the integer.p  pHowever, Im having some bugs in my multiplication. 1digit x 1digit and 2digit x 1digit multiplication work perfectly, but it breaks down at 2digit x 2digit.

With the latter I mean the user should have the data locally until he asks to upload it. That part might ofcourse be something for my app, but perhaps there is some storage where its already built in.p

Calling any message after init e.g. layer.opaque  YES increases the retain counter by one, but only the first call of a message. So the retain counter is allways 1 to high. To proof that this is not just a number problem, I used the second release. The layer will only be freed from memory after the second release.p  pThe behaviour of this could also be produced with autorelease.p  pSo, why does a message to the layer increase its retain count Did I miss some Infromation about retain and release issuesp  pThanks in advancep  pMarcop

Negative 78060 pIm currently working on an app which downloads a zip file and extracts a bunch of tiny mp3 files into external storage. The zip file is about 2.5 meg. p  pIm wondering if it would be a better idea to include the zip file in app resources, and then copy and extract it to the file system. This would prevent the headaches involved in something like a lost connection during the zip file download. I noticed some missing mp3s, and when I checked the zip file, the last 20 or so werent it it. So, it looks like the system can successfully an unfortunately extract from an incomplete zip file. p  pThe downside including the zip file in app resources is obviously that it increases the size of the app by 2.5 meg. Ive specified prefer external storage in the manifest. This isnt supported before release 2.2, i.e. level 8, so Im already excluding those phones, which probably is 20 or 30 percent of the total android phones. But Im not entirely sure if that guarantees the app will be installed on the SD card. p  pIt could be worth including the zip file in the app just to avoid the potential hassles in handling the download of the zip file but if the size of the app makes it unappealing, then thats kind of a drawback  especially if the prefer external doesnt work on some devices. p  pWhich is the better option Ideas are welcome. p

Negative 78060 pIm trying to understand how MT GC works to avoid memory leaks in iOS apps using MonoTouch MT.p  pAs I understood correct me if Im wrong, MT memory management works in this manner each object has a flag which says Dear GC, now Im free to be released whenever you want. When the GC runs, it verifies that flag and remove the object from the memory. So, MT puts every object in a sort of limbo where objects in it will be released next event cycle, maybe. Its a sort of autorealease mechanism. But it also possible to release explicity an object calling its dispose method. In this case, it means adopt retainrelease mechanism.p  pReading about MT, Ive seen that there are objects that go into the managed heap for example references to images and other that go into unmanaged heap for example images. In the first case the managed one I have not to be worry about it, the GC works well. In the second one unmanaged case, I have to release memory explicity. Why this difference Could you explain me how I can distinguish managed from unmanaged objects and when to release explicity the memory calling dispose methodp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 78060 pI have a function that listens for focusout event to clear out a form field. This works well by itself. The problem is jQuery Validation plugin binds to focusout event as well to run validations on the field. The validations are always run after I have a chance to clear the field, and so they are always wrong. I am trying to figure out a way to make sure my listener is always executed before the listener for the validation plugin. p  pSo I guess I am wondering if there is a good way of inserting something into a position in the callstack using jQuery Or perhaps to delay the execution of other binded functions until my function gets a chance to run.p

Negative 78060 pIts possible to create lots of memoryintensive objects and then abandon references to them. For example, I might want to download and operate on some data from a database, and I will do 100 separate download and processing iterations. I could declare a DataTable variable once, and for each query reset it to a new DataTable object using a constructor, abondoning the old DataTable object in memory.p  pThe DataTable class has easy builtin ways to release the memory it uses, including Rows.Clear and .Dispose. So I could do this at the end of every iteration before setting the variable to a new DataTable object. OR I could forget about it and just let the CLR garbage collector do this for me. The garbage collector seems to be pretty effective so the end result should be the same either way. Is it better to explicitly dispose of memoryheavy objects when you dont need them, but add code to do this or just depend on the garbage collector to do all the work for you you are at the mercy of the GC algorithm, but your code is smallerp  pUpon request, here is code illustrating the recycled DataTable variable examplep  precode     queryList is list of 100 SELECT queries generated somewhere else.

Negative 78060 pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd997369.aspx relnofollowThe bottom of this articlea describes how using GetOrAdd may cause if I understand it correctly corruptunexpected results.p  pstrongsnipstrongp  blockquote   pConcurrentDictionary is designed for multithreaded   scenarios. You do not have to use locks in your code to add or remove   items from the collection. However, it is always possible for one   thread to retrieve a value, and another thread to immediately update   the collection by giving the same key a new value.p      pAlso, although all methods of ConcurrentDictionary are   threadsafe, not all methods are atomic, specifically GetOrAdd and   AddOrUpdate. The user delegate that is passed to these methods is   invoked outside of the dictionarys internal lock. This is done to   prevent unknown code from blocking all threads. Therefore it is   possible for this sequence of events to occurp      p1 threadA calls GetOrAdd, finds no item and creates a new item to Add   by invoking the valueFactory delegate.p      p2 threadB calls GetOrAdd concurrently, its valueFactory delegate is   invoked and it arrives at the internal lock before threadA, and so its   new keyvalue pair is added to the dictionary.p      p3 threadAs user delegate completes, and the thread arrives at the   lock, but now sees that the item exists alreadyp      p4 threadA performs a Get, and returns the data that was previously   added by threadB.p      pTherefore, it is not guaranteed that the data that is returned by   GetOrAdd is the same data that was created by the threads   valueFactory. A similar sequence of events can occur when AddOrUpdate   is called.p blockquote  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat is the correct way to verify the data, and retry the update  A nice approach would be an extension method to tryretry this operation based on the contents of old value.p  pHow would this be implemented Can I rely on the result codeverifycode as a validendstate, or must I retry and reretrieve the values using a different method  p  pstrongCodestrongp  pThe following code has a race condition when updating the values.  The desired behavior is that AddOrUpdateWithoutRetrieving will increment various values in different ways using codecode or codeInterlocked.Incrementcode.  p  pI also want to perform multiple field operations in a single unit and retry the update if the previous update didnt take due to a race condition.p  pRun the code and you will see each value appear in the console start out increasing by one, but each of the values will drift and some will be a few iterations aheadbehind.p  precodenamespace DictionaryHowTo      using System     using System.Collections.Concurrent     using System.Collections.Generic     using System.Linq     using System.Text     using System.Threading     using System.Threading.Tasks       The type of the Value to store in the dictionary     class FilterConcurrentDuplicate               Create a new concurrent dictionary.         readonly ConcurrentDictionaryltint, TestDatagt eventLogCache                new ConcurrentDictionaryltint, TestDatagt          static void Main                      FilterConcurrentDuplicate c  new FilterConcurrentDuplicate              c.DoRacenull                   readonly ConcurrentDictionaryltint, TestDatagt concurrentCache               new ConcurrentDictionaryltint, TestDatagt         void DoRacestring[] args                      int max  1000               Add some keyvalue pairs from multiple threads.

Negative 78060 pIm getting this linker error when compiling wxWidgets in Visual Studio 2010.p  precodemsvcrt.libwcrtexew.obj  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol wWinMain16 codepre  pNow heres the problem.  The entry point for wxWidgets is this macrop  precodeIMPLEMENTAPPMyApp codepre  pWhich means I dont use wWinMain as an entry.p  pIve tried disabling the entry point when I compile NOENTRY, but no dice.  Nothing seems to work because if I define wWinMain, then wxWidgets wont start because the entry is IMPLEMENTAPP.  p  pI only receive this error when I compile as static.  If I dont compile as static Ill have to supply the DLLs msvcp100d.dll and msvcr100d.dll on Windows Server 2008 and maybe more DLLs on older versions of Windows that dont have the library installed.p  pNow I understand I am linking again the debug library, but it shouldnt matter if I link again the release because I should receive the same error unresolved external symbol wWinMain16.p  pAny solutionsp

Negative 78060 pI am having a binding update problem with my ComboBox.  My ComboBoxs ItemSource is bound to a list of LaneConfigurations.  The ComboBoxs SelectedItem is bound to the SelectedLaneConfiguration property in my codebehind.  I configured the ComboBoxs ItemTemplate to display the DisplayID property for each LaneConfiguration.p  pThis works most of the time.  However, changing a lane configuration can result in the DisplayID changing.  If you have a particular lane selected and its DisplayID is being displayed as the Text of the ComboBox and then you change the LaneConfiguration object, the Text portion of the ComboBox is not updated with the new DisplayID that should be showing.  When I click the dropdown arrow on the ComboBox, the item appearing as the selected item in the list is showing the correct DisplayID, but that doesnt match the DisplayID that is being shown at the top of the ComboBox in its Text field.p  pIn my code behind, I am firing a PropertyChanged event on the SelectedLaneConfiguration property.  How do I get the ComboBox to realize that the DisplayID property needs updating  I have tried to fire a PropertyChanged event for the DisplayID property, but it is part of the LaneConfiguration class, so it doesnt appear to be updating.p  pI have included the XAML below along with a screenshot that shows the ComboBox Text display out of sync with the content of the ComboBox dropdown. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBJFus.png altScreenShotp  pPartial XAMLp  precodeltComboBox xNamecomboBoxLanes Height26           ItemsSourceBinding SensorConfiguration.LaneConfigurations            SelectedItemBinding PathSelectedLaneConfigurationgt      ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt         ltDataTemplategt            ltTextBlock TextBinding DisplayID, ModeOneWaygt         ltDataTemplategt      ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt ltComboBoxgt codepre  pSome of the codebehindp  precode    public partial class LaneManagement  INotifyPropertyChanged, IDisposable              ..         ..          public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged          private void FirePropertyChangedstring prop                      if PropertyChanged  null                              PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgsprop                                private void SensorConfigurationChanged                      LaneTools.ResetLanePolygons             GenerateLaneTypeDropdowns             FirePropertyChangedSensorConfiguration             FirePropertyChangedSelectedLaneConfiguration             FirePropertyChangedDisplayID                   public class LaneConfiguration  PolygonConfiguration            public override string DisplayID                   get                          return IsLaneGroupstring.FormatLanes 0  1, ID, ID  LaneCount  1                                  string.FormatLane 0, ID                        codepre

Negative 78060 pIve developed a new control which is pretty complex. I also know for a fact that it will not be present on the page the first time its opened, but only when the user clicks a button to show it thus, it first appears on a postback. We also use Microsofts ASP.NET AJAX framework to make all our postbacks partiallyupdating.p  pSince the control is pretty complex, it depends on a bunch of javascript files, has its own CSS file and some images. It would be unreasonable to include those at all times, since it will only be present at a few forms, and even then not always. Also, while currently there is no requirement to host more than one instance of the control, Id like to keep this option open, otherwise 3 years down the road someone will try to do it and be surprised if it doesnt work.p  pSo how do I make it so, that the CSSJS files are included only once on the page even though there might be several such controls, and only on the first request that the control appears there so that subsequent requests dont try to unnecessarily redownload these resourcesp  pcodePage.ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptIncludecode doesnt work on AJAX postbacks codeScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptIncludecode will make the browser redownload the scripts on every request, even though it might have already been downloaded. And neither of them are usable for CSS including. What elsep

Negative 78060 pI need to store large files from several MB to 1GB in Postgres database. The database has multiple schemas. It looks like Postgres has 2 options to store large objects LOB and BYTEA. However we seem to hit problems with each of these options.p  ol lipLOB. This works almost ideal, can store up to 2GB and allows streaming so that we do not hit memory limits in our PHP backend when reading the LOB. However all blobs are stored in pgcatalog and are not part of schema. This leads to a big problem when you try to use pgdump with options n and b to dump just one schema with its blobs. It dumps the schema data correctly however then it includes ALL blobs in the database not just the blobs that belong to the particular schema. Is there a way to dump the single schema with its blobs using pgdump or some other utilitypli lipBYTEA. These are correctly stored per schema so pgdump n works correctly however I cannot seem to find a way to stream the data. This means that there is no way to access the data from PHP if it is larger than memory limit.pli ol  pIs there any other way to store large data in Postgres that allows streaming and correctly works with multiple schemas per databasep  pThanks.p

Negative 78060 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8355359redirecttoanotherpageifjavascriptisdisabledredirect to another page if javascript is disableda  p blockquote    pIve an aspx page which loads several images after detecting clients screen size. Here is how I do this In jquery code, I first detect user screen size, then depending on the size, I do some calculations to decide the number of images to be fetched from database. Then with the use of jquery ajax, I call up a web service which returns json response. Code picks up json and creates page.p  pNow, if user has disabled javascript, this approach doesnt work. Now I have to create page using c code on code behind. The problem is, I cant detect if javascript is disabled from code behind I think this is not possible. I do not want to display a button at the top says something Javascript is disable in your browser. Please click here to display this page. I can put this button in noscript tags. But I do not want user have to click a button before seeing images on page.p  pWhat I want, if javascript is disabled, system should detect it and immediately run a function from code behind. IN this case page size would be fixed and wont vary according to user screen I can not use a hidden field or cookie to detect it since they both will need a postback before detecting javascript is diabled. We know that js code cant run before any page lifecycle event.p  pWell I dont have much hope that my problem could be resolved, but still I want to give it a try. May be someone already have a solution. It would be extremely helpful if you could give your views or suggestion to changeupdate logic.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks and Regards Praveenp

Lets have a look at this queryp  precodeDateTime requestTime  DateTime.Now var items  from n in Validity.isValidAtdb.Items, requestTime             select n codepre  pThis query should return only return Objects of class Item which are valid at requestTime. Note that for ValidTo  requestTime the Item is to be regarded as invalid the timespan ValidFrom to ValidTo is exclusive ValidTo see comments in source code above. p  h2The Problemh2  pI actually have results in my result set items having codeValidTo  requestTimecode.  I just checked this viap  precodeItem i items.FirstOrDefault if i.ValidFrom.HasValue ampamp i.ValidFrom gt requestTime   i.ValidTo.HasValue ampamp requestTime gt i.ValidTo       ... SOME ERROR OUTPUT ...   codepre  p NOTE This error isnt happening seldom, but nearly all the time in the software as .inValidaterequestTime is often called to invalidate an object.  p  pI manually checked via Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Microsoft SQL Server 2008 is used as backend using the produced SQL query by LinQ. I had to declareset pemlinqem0, pemlinqem1 myself which both mean requestTime...p  precodeDECLARE plinq0 DATETIME DECLARE plinq1 DATETIME SET plinq0  20121023 151511.473 SET plinq1  20121023 151511.473 codepre  pThis actually works as expected. But if I use 20121023 151511 as a value instead, Ill receive wrong results as expected. They are similiar to those in my program. So I guess thats the problem...p  pIn Database the DateTime has Milliseconds defined and ValidFromValidTo are stored including Milliseconds. But I assume that the query doesnt include the milliseconds part of the timestamp for any reason... The variable requestTime how ever has the milliseconds value set.p  pUnfortunately I dont know how to check the actual values sent in a query to verify this. I only know how to use the items.toStringMethod to output the generated SQL, which contains placeholders.p  pI tried 1. codedb.Log  Console.Outcode which didnt compile due to an error that db.Log would not be defined also the auto completion didnt suggest Log. Whereas db is derived from DbContext. 2. Also casting items to ObjectQuery and then using .ToTraceString doesnt work, program crashes at runtime with error message that cast is invalid.p  pIf this is important I use .NET 4.0 and EntityFramework.5.0.0.p  h2Questionsh2  ol liHow to LogOutput the complete SQL including values of placeholdersli liHow to fix that problem in an elegant way ...I dont mean a hack that just substracts a second from the time which is assigned to ValidTo in inValidateli ol  pBest regards,p  pStefanp  h2EDIT more details foundh2  pI checked what happens via the SQL profiler, which seems fine. Timestamps with high 7 digits precisions are supplied correctly when querying. BUT I dont get the SELECT causing the incorrect result. So I guessed it must be some caching. So I put a codedb.SaveChangescode directly before my LINQ query. Now I got all queries in the profiler.p  pI tried the following code to change the datatype in database. As it was suggested by Slauma see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8044310270591httpstackoverflow.coma8044310270591a.p  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltItemgt.Propertyf gt f.ValidFrom   .HasColumnTypedatetime2.HasPrecision3 modelBuilder.EntityltItemgt.Propertyf gt f.ValidTo   .HasColumnTypedatetime2.HasPrecision3 codepre  pI dropped the whole database before restart... p  pstrongResultstrong No success using HasPrecisionx where x is one of 0, 3 with or without db.SaveChanges directly before BUT x  7 fairly works with db.SaveChanges directly before the query... p  pSo, unfortunately this problem is still existent... p  h2Current Workaroundh2  pI apply the following method to any DateTime value before assigning it to a database objects property. It just rounds the DateTime to full seconds precision which I configured at the DB. Also this is applied to any DateTime used for comparison.p  pResult This is more a hack than a solution I will need to write access functions for all setter methods, so that a direct assignment cannot happen by accident.p  precode    public static DateTime DateTimeDBRoundDateTime time          DateTime t  time         long fraction  t.Ticks  TimeSpan.TicksPerSecond         if fraction gt TimeSpan.TicksPerSecond  2                      t  t.AddTicksTimeSpan.TicksPerSecond  fraction                  else                      t  t.AddTicksfraction                  return t      codepre

Each page is split to words and for each word a  table is created containing all of the addresses in which the word appears.  If for example the client looking for the word tablet, the app access a table called tablet and will extract all the addresses in the table. If you are searching for the two words then retrieve all addresses two relevant tables and perform cutting each address.p  pThe problem is that at least 10 000 words ie 10 000 tables.

Im new to Python and would like to learn the best practice for doing this sort of thing in Python.

For example during one iteration I may have data for 5 years, the next iteration therell be data for 30 years, and the next therell be data for 17 years.  So at each iteration Ill want to clear the dictionary.  But do I also want to declare the dictionary in a way that gives it a definite form, i.e. so itll always be known to have keys which are years and values which are always 12 element lists of integersp  pThanks in advance for your help with understanding this.p

Negative 78060 pI am thoroughly confused with something I want to do and am looking for some advice. p  pOne of my client has to produce monthly invoice detailing all of the company expenditure, and two other such invoices. The client is sure that he only needs these invoices  and they are extremely simple enough to produce as far as logic is concerned. p  pNow, to make the actual invoice, I dont really want to use reporting solutions like Telerik, SSRS etc.. as I think they are an overkill for my purpose. At the same time, I am not sure how I can get the printer to print the invoices in a neat pages without cutting off anything.p  pI am very tempted to just give the output in a webpage and ask my client to print them off from there.p  pAm I not looking at this the right way Is this possible p  pI could use ITextSharp or something to produce pdfs.. In fact, I think I will go ahead with this if it isnt possible to just output to html page and get the printer to recognize the page breaks somehow. p  pBecause this is a very small job, I dont want to spend too much time on it as the cost of this freelance project is minimal too. p  phr The reason printing to a new page is important is that my client has a few shops he deals with and he would want to print each of his customers their own invoices. I can get him to produce each customers invoice separately and print them but it is not ideal way to deal with it.p  pthanksp

Negative 78060 pI have the apache mod pagespeed installed, everything appears to be working ok. p  pI am using it on my ruby 1.9.3 and rails 3.2 app. I recently installed the gem turbolinks.p  pNow the URLs on my site are getting codeModPagespeednoscriptcodeadded after the trailing slash. This didnt happen before I added turbolinks. p  pWhy does the page speed tool append ModPagespeednoscript to the end of URLs and how can I prevent thisp  pIf turning off a few of the mod pagespeed options were to help then I can maybe do that with no performance loss, eg, minifying js is something I do pre deploy in a precompile, likewise, the Rails asset pipeline does a good job of combining individual .js and .css files into compiled single files etc. Therefore, turning off codecombine javascriptcode wouldnt be a problem. However, I dont know if this is what is causing it, as I implied I believe it is to do with the interaction of turbolinks, my apps http requests and the pagespeed module just not noticing that js is turned on.p  pI must admit I find it odd that I cant find even a remotely similar query to this online. p

Negative 78060 pFor a legacy application, I need to create a registry key with a name in the format codecfoobarbazcode.  Note forward slashes, not backslashes.  To be clear that is a single keys name, with forward slashes, that otherwise looks like a Windows path.  Because I need to script this against lots of servers, PowerShell seems like a great option.p  pThe problem is that I cannot figure out how to create a key in that format via PowerShell.  codeNewItem Path HKLMSOFTWARESomeKey Name cfoobarbazcode errors out with PowerShell thinking Im using codecode as a path separator and failing to find the path codeHKLMSoftwareSomeKeycfoobarcode, which does indeed not exist and shouldnt.  I cant find any other way to abuse codeNewItemcode to get what I want.p  pIs there something Im missing, or should I give up and just generate and load a registry dump the oldfashioned wayp

Negative 78060 pI have a tree of several thousand nodes, decorated by boolean attributes, something like this attributes in parenthesesp  precodeRoot xtrue, ytrue, zfalse    Interior 1        Leaf 1 xfalse, zfalse        Leaf 2 xfalse, yfalse, zfalse    Interior 2        Leaf 3    etc. codepre  pWhat I would like to do is find the smallest number of decorations necessary to preserve the values of the attributes, given the following constraintsinfop  ol liAttributes are inherited by child nodesli liOnly the resulting attributes of the leaf nodes are important including inherited attributes. So if setting a default attribute on an interior node lets me drop a bunch of attributes on its children, thats okay.li liThere is a shorthand in our model for setting all attributes to either true or false. For example, codexfalse,yfalse,zfalsecode can be represented by one decorator, whereas codexfalse,yfalse,ztruecode would take three.li liThe number of child nodes will greatly outnumber the interior nodes at least 25 to 1li liThe initial state of the tree will have many redundancies.li liIm using Java and adding an external lib to deal with this isnt a big deal.li ol  pThese constraints are not flexible as Im working on an integration layer with a Large Enterprise System, so all I can do is try to minimize the number of attribute values we have to store and transit.p  pI think constraint 3 is throwing me for a loop, because without it I could just deal with each attribute individually, which is simple and I already implemented a solution to that before I realized more attributes were coming.p  pI hope this is descriptive enough to give a picture of the general problem. I can give more examples or information if required. Thank youp

It did point to an option for Visual Studios codebigobjcode option which appears to do what we would need. However, were unable to move to Visual Studio.p  pOne suggestion was to add hashsize to the assembler options. This did not help.p  pIf Im not mistaken, the issue lies in the fact that the object files have a limit of 216 entries in them. Actually, according to the error message, I would venture that its a signed 216 entries, but thats peanuts. The codebigobjcode option for Visual Studio would change that to 232. The mailing list result did not know of an equivalent option for gcc. Further google results dont appear to be relevant to this.p  pAt this point well have to refactor our code ugh to get around this limitation. But I am still concerned that, with heavy templating, we could run into the issue again and again weve already run into it with three source files.p  pSo my question is thus is there a gcc equivalent to Microsofts codebigobjcode option Is there a third option that Im not yet foundp

What I want is listlike access efficiency but using an array.  I want to use an array for reasons of cache coherence and so I dont have to continually be calling a memory allocator as using stdlist would when allocating nodes.p  pWhat I thought about doing was creating a class with two arrays.  The first is a set of  elements and the second array is a set of integers where each integer is a free slot in the first array.  So I can addremove elements from the array fairly easily, without allocating new memory for them, simply by taking an index from the free list and using that for the new element.p  pDoes anything like this exist already  If I do my own, Ill have to also make my own iterators, so you can iterate the set avoiding any empty slots in the array, and I dont fancy that very much.p  pThanks.p  pNote  The kind of operations I want to perform on the set arep  ol liIterationli liRandom access of individual elements, by index or handle as Im thinking of itli liRemoval of an element anywhere in the setli liAddition of an element to the set order unimportantli ol

Negative 78060 pIve got a uiviewcontroller with a scrollview in it and a few uiswitches in a blank test project to examine this problem. When I first push it it takes a third of a meg of memory and I dont get that memory back when I unload it. Subsequent loads dont take any further memory but I am unhappy about this wasted half meg, as I want to add more viewcontrollers and this is wasted memory as they might be used once in the early stages of using the app and then not for the rest of the several hours the app might be used. p  pSo whats going on, is the OS caching the viewcontroller or its controls If I strip it down to just a viewcontroller it only hogs about 20k post unload. Add 5 uiswitches and properties and nothing changes but when I connect them up to their properties and it goes up to 300k and with a further 5 controls goes up to about 550k. p  pIm setting them to nil in viewDidUnload, and nilling and releasing them in dealloc, and dealloc is being called on the unload. But despite this I am not getting the memory back. They are declared as properties not ivars, relying on automatic ivar creation and authsynthesised, and Im not directly accessing the ivars apart from in dealloc with release. Theres no reported memory leaks in analyse or instruments. Just this first time memory raid after which the viewcontrollers appetite for my users ram seems saited.p  pIn instruments none of my code is referred to on the stack trace apart from main and most of the loitering garbage seems to be from UIKit and similar.p  pAs I say my only suspicion that I can think of is that ios is trying to be clever and imagining I am going to reuse this stuff sometime but its simply a total waste of memory in my final app this will be taking at least 10 meg in total at this rate. If this is Apples choice is there a way to override it and force the memory to be returned to me p  pThanks in advance for any pointers this is driving me nuts.p
Negative 78060 pI am using a parent process that uses execve to run a child process with specific environment variables that I have defined in the parent process. In the parent process if I look at the memory location esp  0x240 I find all the environment variables. However once the child process is launched, I am unable to find the memory address where the predefined environment variables have been stored. p  pI would have thought that since execve replaces the parent process with the child process the environment variables passed to the child process would be located at 0xbffffffa minus the length of the environment variable string in Linux.  However when the child process is launched I no longer have access to that location in memory. The esp of the parent process before it calls execve is 0xbffff120, once the child process is launched the esp jumps to 0xbf9835a0. Im guess this is because the child process has root privileges that the parent process did not have Now when I look at the memory from the top of the stack up to the point where I no longer have access to the memory, there is no signed of any of the environment variables that were passed from the parent process. Where would they be located Also on a more general note, when you run a process are the environment variables all copied to the high end in memory at the very bottom of the stack p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlio.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltunistd.hgt  char envvari[] x31xc0  ....

Negative 78060 pIm writing a feature to produce CSV snapshots of screen data.  p  pI need this to be datadriven.   Thus I need to avoid hardcoding each snapshot in Java, but rather load it from a data source such as an XML file or a database.   The data is contained in Java beans.p  pIm using SuperCSV with the Dozer extension both at 2.1.0.p  pThis combination seems perfect since I can code the mappings from the beans to the columns in Dozer XML mapping files.  p  pThis works well for the data, but I have not found a way to specify the strings to use for the CSVs column headers other than to hardcode them in Java as is done in all of the examples and test cases Ive looked at.  That is not datadriven.p  pIs there a way for me to code the column headers in the mapper file.  Or even to extract them from the mapper file, construct a List and pass them to the codewriterHeadercode methodp  pI think it would be OK to just use the bean property names as the headers, although ideal situation is that I am provided some additional metadata notation in the XMLs codeltFieldgtcode tag that specifies the header.p  pId have posted this on SourceForge, but Im getting a 500 error there.p

Recently my work machine was rebuilt, and while trying to install oracle, on the step that shows TNS port, MTS Port, and HTTP Port, it will not accept the default 1521 port, or any other port I try Ive tried quite a few.

Negative 78060 pI am at the beginning of researching how to do something and not sure what is the proper name of what I am trying to research and if there is something that can be done in jquery, or a mix of jquery and css. What I am looking for is something similar to a small pop up when you hover over something similar to hovering over a hyperlink will reveal the full link. But it will be styled to something that looked like a dialog box and instead of hovering over it the user will have to click it to see that dialog box, but it will be displayed similar to hoovering over something. I hope this question is clear and that I am not over thinking this.p

Negative 78060 pIve read about using Google to handle signins from a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2Login relnofollowthis websitea, but it doesnt explain very much about what should be going on with the database. p  pNormally for user accounts in a database youd have fields like codeidcode, codeusernamecode, codepasswordcode, etc. From what I read in the link, you will eventually get the ID token for a user, and inside is a key called codesubcode that has a value in it that you can use to identify the user. p  pMy question is, where would this codesubcode be stored in the database  Would it go in the codeidcode field codeUsernamecode field p  pI think it shouldnt go in the codeusernamecode field since theres the possibility that someone creates a username that is exactly the same as someones Google codesubcode id. But it also seems weird to put it in the codeidcode field. p  pAlso, would there need to be another field in the codeuser accountscode table that is a boolean in order to differentiate between users signed in natively and users signed in through Googlep

Negative 78060 pI am having a lot of issues with IE 10, the first issue I had was that IE10 did not want to open links in new tabs. I found the solution to this by creating the registry entryp  precodeHKEYCURRENTUSERSoftwareMicrosoftInternet ExplorerMainTabProcGrowth with a value of 0 codepre  pSome people said that it should be a 1 but, for me only 0 fixed the new tab issue. Next, opening a PDF... when trying to open PDFs all I get is a small black box with an X in it. I researched this issue and everywhere I found it said that the solution is to createp  precodeHKEYCURRENTUSERSoftwareMicrosoftInternet ExplorerMainTabProcGrowth with a value of 1 codepre  pSo, I changed it to 1 and sure enough PDFs are working now, but now the new tab doesnt work.p  pSo the question is What am I missing I need both of these features to work. Has anybody else encountered this issue.p  pThis is IE10 on Windows 7.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo, We had no other choice so we called Microsoft. I got somewhat of a solution for this but it is still not resolved 100. Apparently you dont need the above registry entry at all. The preliminary solution that has been given isp  blockquote   pOpen regedit and go to the below registry,p      pHKEYCLASSESROOTInterface79EAC9C5BAF911CE8C8200AA004BA90BProxyStubClsid32p      pThe problematic value 79EAC9D0BAF911CE8C8200AA004BA90Bp      pThe correct value A4A1A128768F41E0BF75E4FDDD701CBAp blockquote  pAlso get rid of the TabProcGrowth registry entry. This resolved opening new tabs and opening PDF FILES. That means that if you are trying to open test.pdf it will work like a champ. If you are clicking on a link that sends you to a service, servlet or anything else that dynamically renders a pdf using the content type applicationpdf it wont render at all. p  pI am still working with them and will update as soon as I get this resolved.p  pstrongNEW UPDATEstrongp  pJust to give everyone an update on this issue. We continue to experience this issue with all new computers we setup here in our office. We have had to adjust the registry every time. We  recently took the time and took the new computer setup one step at a time to see what part of our setup messes with the registry. At the end we found that we are installing a product called strongImaging Professionalstrong, right after this install the registry got messed up again. p  pWe unfortunately were installing this, because some of our older software uses it. We are currently working on the new enhanced version of that application and will no longer need to install Imaging Professional anymore. p  pFYI, even if you remove it your registry will still be messed up. Manual fix must be applied.p

Negative 78060 pRecently I was reading about concept of layers in FoundationDB. I like their idea, the decomposition of storage from one side and access to it from other.p  pThere are some unclear points regarding implementation of the layers. Especially how they communicate with the storage engine. There are two possible answers they are parts of server nodes and communicate with the storage by fast native API calls e.g. as linked modules hosted in the server process OR hosted inside client application and communicate through network protocol. For example, the SQL layer of many RDBMS is hosted on the server. And how are things with FoundationDBp  pPS These two cases are different from the performance view, especially when the clinentserver communication is highlatency.p

Negative 78060 pI have a Linux machine I regularly log on to via ssh putty from Windows. Im running VcXsrv Xserver on my Windows desktop. I mainly use this to run a debugger ddd and firefox to access our webbased code review system. Its convenient to use the Linux firefox so I can launch it from a script. I normally launch this with newtab so as not to keep creating new windows.p  pNow Ive got a new update Linux machine which Im running alongside the old one for the time being. What Ive noticed is some odd behaviour when I launch a new firefox session if theres one already running on either machine, then it uses that. p  pWhat Id like to be able to do is still launch as a new tab but only under the instance of firefox from the current machine, not an instance from a different machine that happens to be displaying on the same Xserver.p  pIve been playing around with various flags including noremote, newinstance and also defining and using specific profiles. However Ive been unable to get the desired result. Either I get the behaviour I described above, or I get an error saying something like Firefox is already running but not responding, please close it.p

Negative 78060 pThis seems to be a chewed out question but almost all the answers I found were for the desktop application which uses itemStateChanged for detecting the change in the value of the combo box and then updating the other combo boxes. But so far I have not found any acceptable answers in terms of a web applicationJ2EE. So what should I use to update the combo boxes dynamically, Eg, I have 3 combo boxes branch, semester, subjects. Now based on the value of selected for branch and semester the value for the subjects combo box should change. Should I use Javascript or JSPServlets for my task. This seemed to be an opinion based question but thats what Im looking for. Kindly tell me the pros and cons of using Javascript or JSPServlets. Many thanks.p

Negative 78060 pI am working on a simulation of poker and now I have to rank hands effectively p  pEvery hand is a combination of 5 cards and is represented as an codeuint64tcode.br Every bit from 0 Ace of Spades, 1 Ace of Hearts to 51 Two of Clubs indicates if the corresponding card is part bit  1 or isnt part bit  0 of the hand.

Negative 78060 pI wanted to get some advice as to which direction would suit the app I am trying to create.

I also need to be able to add multiple users.p  pHaving said all that, I have been researching all of the ways to store persistent data in OBJC and see that it looks to be a choice between Core Data, using a Mutable Dictionary or possibly a plist file. Given my needs above, can anyone provide some guidancep  pI am extremely new to ObjectiveC and programming in general. I have been wanting to build my own app for a long time and decided to pull the trigger and go for it. Ive purchased several books on it and have done a tonne of tutorials written and video  reviewed Apples own documentation. I have basically been trying to find a tutorial close to what I am needing to do, but am running into issues with that. Any help and advice is greatly appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 78060 pI am currently making a string calculator in Java. Now I am trying to make it work with negative numberse.g. when typing 37, the result to be 4. Currently, when typing 37, it will return 4, because it sees  being the first operator, so it will perform subtraction on those numbers. In the calcOperators list, I am adding all the operators, while in calcOperands, I add all numbers and store them as Integers. My question how can I make the programme accept 1 or 2 as one whole number instead of taking  as an operator and 2 as a number. I tried to use numberformatexception, but does not work.

Negative 78060 pIve implemented iCarousel in my app. I would like to have the iCarousel scroll by user iteration to one direction only.p  pMy scenario is a list of views where the user can only go to the next one the one to the right by answering a question on the current view, so he cant go to the next one until he answers that. Once he answers, Im programmatically scrolling to the next item . I still would like to have the users be able to scroll back previous views to the left.p  pRight now Im setting codescrollEnabledcode to codeNOcode so the user cant scroll at all.p  pI thought of doing something with codecarouselWillBeginDraggingcode and changing the codescrollEnabledcode to codeNOcode depending of which direction he is scrolling, and set the codescrollEnabledcode back to codeYEScode on codecarouselDidEndDraggingcode, but I couldnt figure out a reliable way of finding out which direction the user is scrolling.p  pAny suggestions or ideas are appreciatedp

Negative 78060 pI am reading about index implementation using symbol tables in book by author Robert Sedwick in Algorithms in C.p  pBelow is snippet from the bookp  blockquote   pWe can adapt binary search trees to build indices in precisely the   same manner as we provided indirection for sorting and for heaps.   Arrange for keys to be extracted from items via the key member   function, as usual. Moreover, we can use parallel arrays for the   links, as we did for linked lists. We use three arrays, one each for   the items, left links, and right links. The links are array indices   integers, and we replace link references such asp      px  xlp      pin all our code with array references such asp      px  l[x].p      pThis approach avoids the cost of dynamic memory allocation for each   nodethe items occupy an array without regard to the search function,   and we preallocate two integers per item to hold the tree links,   recognizing that we will need at least this amount of space when all   the items are in the search structure. The space for the links is not   always in use, but it is there for use by the search routine without   any time overhead for allocation. Another important feature of this   approach is that it allows extra arrays extra information associated   with each node to be added without the treemanipulation code being   changed at all. When the search routine returns the index for an item,   it gives a way to access immediately all the information associated   with that item, by using the index to access an appropriate array.p      pThis way of implementing BSTs to aid in searching large arrays of   items is sometimes useful, because it avoids the extra expense of   copying items into the internal representation of the ADT, and the   overhead of allocation and construction by new. The use of arrays is   not appropriate when space is at a premium and the symbol table grows   and shrinks markedly, particularly if it is difficult to estimate the   maximum size of the symbol table in advance. If no accurate size   prediction is possible, unused links might waste space in the item   array.p blockquote  pMy questions on above text arep  ol lipWhat does author mean by we can use parallel arrays for the links as we did for linked lists  What does this statment mean and what are parallel arrays.pli lipWhat does author mean links are array indices and we replace link references such x xl with xl[x]pli lipWhat does author mean by Another important feature of this approach is that it allows extra arrays extra information associated with each node to be added without the treemanipulation code being changed at all. pli ol

Negative 78060 pWe are developing a windows 8 store app which at some point will require the ability to instant message among the client apps.p  pI am the backend guy writing php scripts and my friend is the .net guy writing c code.

Now we reached that phase that our app must be able to actually communicate.p  pNow the problem is, the .net guy is saying that the wcf client callback contract service that he had tested earlier is working fine for desktop apps but is not working with the metro apps.

Negative 78060 pWe do an import from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter on a lot of artistpages, so the users can find get the newest updates from that particular artist. However since we want to import about 5 updates and were keen to get the pageload to about 1 second, we need some kind of smart caching of the content. Were a part of a bigger organization, so we dont pay for our CDN traffic, so Ive though of using them to the max.p  pstrongMy idea for a flowstrong First user do an fully import  images and text gets saved in JSON which gets stored locally on users computer and on serverCDN for other users. When a new user enters the page, the JSON gets imported, which will import images and text too. in the background we check if new updates are available and well add those to the stream. If new updates, these gets added to the JSON. Old updates gets removed. If a user have visited the site before the user will get the JSON from hisher cache.p  pDoes anyone know of a better way We develop it in BackboneJSp

Negative 78060 pI have a rails engine Im developing. This is my first one, besides the example in rails documentation, so I dont have a good ref on what works. It has a partial that im requiring the Application to render.p  precodeltrender partial myenginefoobargt codepre  pThat works fine.  And i understand why i need to reference the partial through the engine name space.p  pBut within the partial, i apparently have to use the name space as well. So when i render a photo p  precode lt imagetagmyengineaddphoto.jpg gt codepre  pthat is counter intuitive based on the documentation. Am I doing something wrong, or is just the way it isp  pOkay  thanks to Rich Peck  I think I understand better.   Let me enumerate so you can correct me if Im still confused.p  pI was confused as to how the Namespace is generated for the engine.  I was assuming that the structure generated the name space, and that when you were inside the engine, you would operate just as if you were in a normal app.  And the namespace was automagic.  p  pBut if I understand correctly the name space for the rails component is generated by encapsulating them in the    module EngineName  which is taken care of by the generators, but if youre creating the file manually, then you need to add the encapsulation in the files.  Since this was my first engine I didnt know that they were missing.p  pFor the Asset pipeline the namespace is generated by the structure  imageenginename....p  pSo even within the engine unless your inside the module, you have to honor the namespace EngineNameModelNameMethod. p  pThe namespace isnt applied to the task file, doesnt seem to like being incapsulated in a module.  But that is redundant anyway since the rake task already provide a namespace method.  p  precodeAla  namespace db do codepre  pI was also surprised to find that you need to manually include the namespaced application controller in the namespaced controllers ala p  precoderequiredependency enginenameapplicationcontroller codepre  pbut as Rich says, the engine is just a glorified module, so I guess it needs a little help now and then.p  pAnd of course the Javascript files are isolated because theyre only loaded when one of the pages from the engine are loaded, and NOT when a partial from the engine is rendered.  You can have the user of the engine include the javascript file in their application.js, but then they need to be namespaced manually to avoid confusing them with similar JS from other sources.  Theres a good blog on actually doing that by  Kenneth Truyers that Id a hrefhttpwww.kennethtruyers.net20130427javascriptnamespacesandmodules relnofollowbookmarkeda for a future exercise, maybe Ill need to get to it now.   p  plso the locales are not name spaced, so you need to do that yourself.  Simple to add enginename to the locale file hierarchy     ala   de                enginename             variables I would recommend adding a prefix to the engine name like x so that you avoid getting your engine locales clobbered by a user using the same name as a variable.  So xAdmin would be better then Admin since its likely someone like me would use Admin as a variable for an admin function and discover that all the localization in your engines suddenly disappeared. p  pRich, am I closerp  pNow to extend my question, p  pIm not sure that the initialization files are namespaced.  Does a enginename.rb file in the apps initializers directory overwrite one with the same name in the engines initializer directory  I assume if its true we can just use a different name in the engine initializer since I think it there are no real associations to the file name, just bookkeeping.p  pNow how to extend a model in the app.p  pSo to add columns to a apps model is it okay to do this in engine.rb located in libbr     mattraccessor userclass         mattraccessor usertablep  pin the engineinitializer.rbp  precode    engine.userclass User     engine.usertableusers codepre  pthen in the migration p  precodeaddcolumn  Engine.usertable.tosym, attribute     addindex   Engine.usertable.tosym, attribute,            name indexEngine.usertableonengineattribute.tosym codepre  pwhich seems to work okay p  pBut how do we add methods to the model.  Im having the user add require engineuserinclude.rbp  pIs there a nice way to do thatp

Negative 78060 pI have functions with two different type signaturesp  precodef  Int gt [a] gt [a] g  Int, Int gt [a] gt [a] codepre  pThe first parameter determines the length of the list that the function operates on. For example, codefcode might operate on lists of length codep1code and codegcode operates on lists of length codepe1code for first arguments codepcode and codep,ecode respectively.p  pI use codefcode and codegcode as arguments to another function codeh  Int gt [a] gt [a] gt [a] gt [a]code which needs to know this length function codehcodes first argument. What I find myself doing currently isp  precodep gt h p1 f p p,e gt h pe1 g p,e codepre  peverywhere I use codehcode in combination with codefcode and codegcode. This duplication is error prone and messy.p  pThe goal is to find a way to avoid passing the length argument to codehcode. Instead, codehcode should be able to determine the length itself based on the function argument. p  pOne nonsolution would be to change the definition of codefcode top  precodef  Int, Int gt [a] gt [a] f 2,  previous def f p,  previous def  funcToLen  Int, Int gt [a] gt [a] gt Int, Int gt Int funcToLen f p,  p1 funcToLen g p,e  pe1  h  Int, Int gt Int, Int gt [a] gt [a] gt [a] gt [a] h p,e func xs  let len  funcToLen func                        func  func p,e                    in previous def   usage p gt h p, f p,e gt h p,e g codepre  pThis has several drawbacksp  ul liI have to change the first argument of codefcode, and then ignore the second part of the tupleli liWhen I actually use codehcode with codefcode, I have to create a dummy argument for the second part of the tupleli liMost importantly, codefuncToLencode doesnt work because I cant pattern match on function names.li ul  pAnother solution that actually works is to use codeEithercodep  precodef  Int gt Int, [a] gt [a] f 2 xs  1, previous def f p xs  p1, previous def  g  Int, Int gt Either Int [a] gt [a] g p,1 xs  1, previous def g p,e xs  pe1, previous def  h  Int, [a] gt [a] gt [a] gt [a] h ef  let len  fst ef             f  snd ef         in previous def codepre  pThis also has a few downsidesp  ul liThe length function is duplicated for each pattern of codefcode and codegcodeli liThe type signatures of codefcode, codegcode, and codehcode are all uglierli liI cant immediately use codefcode and codegcode on their own i.e. not as arguments to codehcode. Instead I have to peel off the tuple.li ul  pIm looking for ways to clean this up so that I dont have to duplicate the length function everywhere, but also allows me to use the functions codefcode and codegcode in the expected way.

Ive tried the following codep  precodewindow.chart  new Highcharts.StockChart  ...     rangeSelector          inputDateFormat dmY,         inputEditDateFormat dmY,            ... , function chart                apply the date pickers             setTimeoutfunction                   input.highchartsrangeselector,   chart.options.chart.renderTo.datepicker                     format ddmmyyyy                              , 0          codepre  pBut the control goes mad then i.e. it either selects random dates like 3June34 [ 34 year, not 1934] or even refuses to change the date at all.p  pI guess there must be some a problem in converting date between datepicker and chart.

Negative 78060 pWould like to detect where a tween has stopped before finishing. The implementation of this can be when I alpha tween a MovieClip from 0 to 1 with a Mouse RollOver but I do not finish the tween and instead I RollOut the Mouse. The starting value of the reversed alpha tween is not 1 but an intermediate value between 0 and 1 depending on where och when the tween has stopped.p  pMy question is to detect that value when the tween stopped progressing.p  pThanks for helping me p

Negative 78060 pMy OS X app features an inapplication help system that consists of static strings worth roughly 4 MB of raw text data.p  pNormally, one would store these help texts in and on access fetch them from a lightweight database SQLite springs to mind that comes bundled with the application binary. Instead, for the reason of simplicity I chose to store the help text in a large codeNSDictionarycode consisting of many codeNSStringcode generated automatically at compile time. Access is reasonably fast and the only drawback I can think of is the constant consumption of 4 MB of memory the codeNSDictionarycode has even when its not in use  which is really not an issue with modern day hardware. My solution is pragmatic, works fine for now, makes a compact app that doesnt spill its internal data on disk and yet it gives me an uneasy feeling.p  pSo, I think my question is if what Im doing is okay or if it is bad practice in any way.  Concise strongIs it, from a technical point of view, okay to bake in large amounts of text into an application binarystrong Is there a size limit of static variable data that can be stored in 64 bit Darwin MachO imagesp

Negative 78060 pI have an ExpandableListView setup working very properly and as I wanted but with a minor problem I want the group indicator the arrow to expand and collapse when I open or close the group. This function is although partially working but not fully correct. p  pThe problem is that when I expand lets say group1 the indicator of group2 automatically gets invisible Image at the end of post. and if I continue to expsnd group3 then the indicator of group4 hides. at the end only the terminal groups i.e ending groups have the indicator, the indicators of all other groups are invisible.

It links to two View Controllers.p  pThe first View Controller to display a newsfeed with pictures uploaded by the user the one at the bottom in the storyboard.p  pThe second View Controller serves to initiate the taking of a picture and attach some data to it. In the last step top right, when touching Save in the right item of the Navigation bar, I want the user to be redirected to the newsfeed View Controller passing it some data.p  pI tried using a segue and it works. The data are passed to the newsfeed but the wrong tab is selected. I changed the selected tab usingp  precode[self.tabBarController setSelectedIndex0] codepre  pBut by tapping on the second tab again, things are messed up. I can see the newsfeed instead of the taking a picture screen. If I tap again, it crashes.p  pAt some point I thought I may have got the wrong storyboard and should have implemented a TabBar in my newsfeed and handle the taking picture as a modal view. p  pWould you know any clean way to achieve thisp  pThanksp

Negative 78060 pI have a question about best practices for relational database design. Here is an example that shows the issue Im not sure about.p  pYou have software packages with names, which hold several pieces of software. A user can own any amount of software package but only comment on the individual pieces of software in the packages he owns. p  pMy entities are User, Software Package, Software Piece, Comment. User  Software Package is N to N. Software Package  Software Piece is N to N.p  pIs the best you can do in a relational database make a Comment hold a foreign key for both a User and a Software piece. I dont really see a way to ensure through the DB schema that Comments can only exist between Users and a Software Piece from one of the Software Packages they own.p  pIs there a way to associate the Comment entity with a relationship that spans two entitiesp

Negative 78060 pemThis is an experiment for a proof of concept. I created a VPS where I have a simple upload form and PHP form processor script. The point of this is to test an iOS and Android app we are developing. This question is not about security or efficiency yet, just functionality. I need to modify the PHP below to receive an image using POST without the aid of an HTML FORM. We are currently POSTing to Dropbox and Google Drive no problem. We are now looking into what it would take to store images on our own servers, we just need to formulate a proof of concept to receive this image with PHP that was submitted with POST.emp  pWith that out of the way I want to send an image to a server from a mobile device over the only upload method available without additional libraries  HTTP. Using FTP or SSH requires additional code and were trying to keep it light. So I was going to send an image with HTTP POST which I am pulling off with an HTML FORM currently. However, I need to formulate a POST that sends only an image  no other variables. This is my current HTML formp  precodelt The data encoding type, enctype, MUST be specified as below gt ltform enctypemultipartformdata actionURL methodPOSTgt     lt MAXFILESIZE must precede the file input field gt     ltinput typehidden nameMAXFILESIZE value30000 gt     lt Name of input element determines name in FILES array gt     Send this file ltinput nameuserfile typefile gt     ltinput typesubmit valueSend File gt ltformgt codepre  pThis is my processor PHPp  precodeltphp  In PHP versions earlier than 4.1.0, HTTPPOSTFILES should be used instead  of FILES.  uploaddir  varwwwuploads uploadfile  uploaddir . basenameFILES[userfile][name]  echo ltpregt if moveuploadedfileFILES[userfile][tmpname], uploadfile      echo File is valid, and was successfully uploaded.n  else      echo Potential error.n   echo Here is some more debugging info printrFILES  print ltpregt  gt codepre  pWorks perfectly over a browser, no problems. Now I need to modify the PHP portion to allow a POST over URL  essentially dropping the use of an HTML form.

Negative 78060 pI noticed this when I reran my app on 2.2 and 2.3.4 devices.

I havent made a thorough research if this works on startActivityforbrowser scheme, not embedded webview.

Negative 78060 pIn my iOSObjective C projects, I often have a constants.h file with my API keys and such. Until today, Ive been declaring my constants as codestaticcode codeconstcode like sop  precodestatic NSString  const kAPIKey  wembvkejrvb43789gvbiu2bvfake codepre  pThis works fine, but with the unfortunate downside that I can strongonlystrong create constants for primitives and NSString literals, essentially. Other objects, such as UIColor objects, cannot be stored in this constant emas they cannot be initialized with a static literal syntaxem my understanding, citation required.p  pAfter reading some C docs, I understand a few thingsp  ul liThe codestaticcode is unnecessary, as codeconstcode are implicitly static.li liCalling codeNSString  const xcode is actually declaring a constant and immutable value in x. I cannot change the value, but may be able to change what x points to.li liThis const has eminternalem linkage, meaning the the value is defined right away presumable at compile time.li ul  pAre these conclusions correctp  pHow does an codeextern constcode differ I assume they are externally linked thus the extern keyword. Are they defined at run time Can I create some sort of emdynamicem codeextern constcode that can be set with a value returned by a class methodp  pFor example, I would like to create a globallyscoped constant that contains a UIColor value. I would like to construct this color value using the code[UIColor colorWithRedgreenbluealpha]code class method.

Negative 78060 pDesired Result After hearing many horror stories of malicious users gaining access to AWS accounts and wiping out resources, Im interested in creating a system that can copy RDS Snapshots and EC2 AMIsVolumes to a completely separate AWS account for use as a timecapsule or icecoldrecovery site. p  pSecurity Basics I use IAM with MFA for all existing accounts, and I restrict whocandowhat based on needtoaccess. Most users have readonly access to everything, and a select few are power users. We never use the root account. p  pInitial discoveries Since there isnt a native way to copy AMIs or Snapshots to another account, my current understanding is that I would need to use our current account to allow the vault account access to the AMIsSnapshots, then use the vault account to launch an instanceDB from the AMISS, then make another AMISS of the instanceDB in order to make a complete copy in another account. p  pQuestions p  ol liIs this stupidli liIs there a better wayli liIs anyone aware of a service or scripting solution that could accomplish this is a simple manner li ol  pIm sure with enough time I could use the SDK and make something that does this, but Im very open to NOT coding it myself.p

Negative 78060 pIm picking apart some C Python wrapper code that allows the consumer to construct custom old style and new style Python classes from C.p  pThe original code comes from a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectscxx relnofollowPyCXXa, with old and new style classes a hrefhttpsourceforge.netpcxxcodeHEADtreetrunkCXXCXXPython3ExtensionOldType.hxx relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpsourceforge.netpcxxcodeHEADtreetrunkCXXCXXPython3ExtensionType.hxx relnofollowherea. I have however rewritten the code substantially, and in this question I will reference my own code, as it allows me to present the situation in the greatest clarity that I am able. I think there would be very few individuals capable of understanding the original code without several days of scrutiny... For me it has taken weeks and Im still not clear on it.p  pThe old style simply derives from PyObject, p  precodetemplatelttypename FinalClassgt class ExtObjold  public ExtObjBaseltFinalClassgt      which  ExtObjBasenoTemplate  PyObject      public      forwarding function to mitigate awkwardness retrieving static method       from base type that is incomplete due to templating     static TypeObjectamp typeobject  return ExtObjBaseltFinalClassgttypeobject       static void onetimesetup              typeobject.settpdealloc []PyObject t  delete FinalClasst            typeobject.supportGetattr  every object must support getattr          FinalClasssetup          typeobject.readyType            every object needs getattr implemented to support methods     Object getattr const char name  override  return getattrmethodsname        MARKER1  protected     explicit ExtObjold              PyObjectInit this, typeobject.typeobject   MARKER2      codepre  pWhen onetimesetup is called, it forces by accessing base class codetypeobjectcode creation of the associated codePyTypeObjectcode for this new type.p  pLater when an instance is constructed, it uses codePyObjectInitcodep  pSo far so good. p  pBut the new style class uses much more complicated machinery. I suspect this is related to the fact that new style classes allow derivation.p  pstrongAnd this is my question, why is the new style class handling implemented in the way that it is Why is it having to create this extra PythonClassInstance structure Why cant it do things the same way the oldstyle class handling does  i.e. Just type convert from the PyObject base type  And seeing as it doesnt do that, does this mean it is making no use of its PyObject base typestrongp  pThis is a huge question, and I will keep amending the post until Im satisfied it represents the issue well. It isnt a good fit for SOs format, Im sorry about that. However, some worldclass engineers frequent this site one of my previous questions was answered by the lead developer of GCC for example, and I value the opportunity to appeal to their expertise.

This will be because Python runtime will often trigger functions we have placed in its function table, and the first parameter will be the PyObject responsible for the call.

This saves the consumer from having to code repetitive error trapping.emp  pSo, we pull out the base type for the associated C object and call its virtual setattro just using setattro as an example here. A derived class will have overridden setattro, and this override will get called.p  pThe oldstyle class provides such an override, which Ive labelled MARKER1  it is in the top listing for this question.p  pThe only the thing I can think of is that maybe different maintainers have used different techniques.

Which means that we need to tag on an extra sizeofvoid bytes to the end of the PyObject that actually does get allocated, and use this to point to our associated C object instance. p  pHowever, there is some contradiction here.p  precodestruct PythonClassInstance      PyObjectHEAD     ExtObjBasenoTemplate mpycxxobject  codepre  p if this is indeed the structure that accomplishes the above, then it is saying that the new style class instance is indeed fitting exactly over a PyObject, i.e. It is not overlapping into the mpycxxobject.p  pAnd if this is the case, then surely this whole process is unnecessary.p  pEDIT here are some links that are helping me learn the necessary ground workp  pa hrefhttpeli.thegreenplace.net20120416pythonobjectcreationsequence relnofollowhttpeli.thegreenplace.net20120416pythonobjectcreationsequenceabr a hrefhttprealmike.orgblog20100718introductiontonewstyleclassesinpython relnofollowhttprealmike.orgblog20100718introductiontonewstyleclassesinpythonabr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4163018createanobjectusingpythonscapiCreate an object using Python39s C APIap

But if this is OK how should I access my student object in the View. Sure I can just access the component but is this a good approach Is it better to build something like a model in a modelp  pI am a little bit confused as long as there is one student object in one view everything is ok but otherwise my brain is missing some information p

Similarly, WPF has the Dispatcher object.  Both of these will invoke a method on the thread that the form controldispatcher was created on.  So I could create a method that looks like thisp  precodeprivate void ThrowExceptionException ex       throw ex  codepre  pAnd invoke it via the form control or dispatcher.  But in this case, Im making a console application, so I dont have form controls, and I could only use the dispatcher if I added a reference to WindowsBase.dll, which doesnt seem like it would be the right thing to do if youre not creating a WPF application.p  pI tried using delegates, but the BeginInvoke method there creates a new thread to execute the method on.  I want to execute the method on Thread A.p

Negative 78060 pI keep getting the following error, and I dont understand why. It happens on suspend, but only after visiting a page twice. That is to say, the app loads up and I go to the page, then use VS2013 to suspend the app and it works just fine. However, if I instead open the app, go to the page, then go back and go to the page again, then suspend... I get the error. I am not passing any complex types to frame.Navigate, nor even any primitive types. Ive changed my app to ensure it doesnt even use navigation parameters anymore, in an effort to fix this issue. Meanwhile, since Im using MVVM via Prism, I never call frame.Navigate directly anyways. I believe something with the SessionStateService calls it, but I cant debug through there to figure out whats going on.p  pError GetNavigationState doesnt support serialization of a parameter type which was passed to Frame.Navigate.p  pThe only weird thing Im doing is that I am embedding a UserControl on my page and I have the viewmodel for it in my page viewmodel. However, the embedded controls viewmodel is not a Prism.StoreApps.Viewmodel, it is just implementing INotifyPropertyChanged. This is because I use this user control in 2 pages, rather than it being its own page. Is this causing the issue The user controls viewmodel is a property on each pages viewmodel class, and the property is marked as [RestorableState], as are the properties within that user controls viewmodel. If you think this could be causing it, please let me know the proper way to embed a user control MVVM style for prism. p  pNote, I also setup an override for OnRegisterKnownTypesForSerialization and called SessionStateService.RegisterKnownType for my user controls viewmodel. p

The basal cells that normally give rise to the suspensor proliferate abnormally, giving rise to multiple embryos. A high proportion of the seeds fail to develop viable embryos, and those that do, contain a high proportion of partially or completely duplicated embryos. The adult plants are smaller and less vigorous than the wild type and have a severely stunted root. The ltemphgttwn21ltemphgt mutation, which is the only known allele, was caused by a TDNA insertion in the 5 untranslated region of a putative valyltRNA synthetase gene, ltitgtvalRSltitgt. The insertion causes reduced transcription of the ltitgtvalRSltitgt gene in reproductive tissues and developing seeds but increased expression in leaves. Analysis of transcript initiation sites and the expression of promoterreporter fusions in transgenic plants indicated that enhancer elements inside the first two introns interact with the border of the TDNA to cause the altered pattern of expression of the ltitgtvalRSltitgt gene in the ltemphgttwn2ltemphgt mutant. The phenotypic consequences of this unique mutation are interpreted in the context of a model, suggested by Vernon and Meinke ampamplsqbVernon, D. M. ampamp Meinke, D. W. 1994 ltemphgtDev. Biol.ltemphgt 165, 566573ampamprsqb, in which the apical cell and its decendents normally suppress the embryogenic potential of the basal cell and its decendents during early embryo development.ltpgt ltabsgt ltfmgt codepre

From my current understanding, it currently has to go through the entire table millions of rows and add startdate and enddate to each row. Then does it have to go through each row again and test against the WHERE condition p  pI ask this because when I remove the cross join and hardcode the startdate and enddate for condition1, it takes substantially less time. Im trying to avoid hardcoding in the dates because it will lead to serious tedium down the road. p  pSo to reiterate, is there a better way to filter VISITINFO by specific dates in VALIDDATES   p  pEdit I just realized I left out a pretty huge piece of information, being that this is all in HIVE. So EXISTS and joins on a between b and c are out of the question.p

Negative 78060 pIf you analize the following code, You will see that there 4 function being invoked many times pushNextEntityUpdatedRows, pushNextUpdatedRow, pushNextEntityCreatedRows, pushNextCreatedRow, thats not a BUG, Thats how I desgined my code to work. What you should know is that I have a class DataAccess that extends strongSQLiteOpenHelperstrong and I only instantiate that class once. Everytime the functions strongpushNextEntityUpdatedRowsstrong and strongpushNextEntityCreatedRowsstrong are invoked, a rawQuery is executed in my DataAccess  class instance. I never close the connection, I only close the Cursor objects instances. I dont know What is causing this strongStackOverflowErrorstrong. I also dont know why It always happens after 145 invocations.
