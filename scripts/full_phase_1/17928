Positive 17928 pIm struggling to set a property AdjustWidth and I want this to increase the width of a tree I add to the tree. I can add nodes scenarios to the tree but then I have to adjust the window myself, and the initial width of the window starts at a specified width and I want the width to be enough just for the specific number of nodes shown on the window. I am wondering how to set a property to adjust the width depending on the number of nodes shownp  precode        private readonly CognitiveTreeBuilderViewModel viewModel     private CognitiveTreeMode

Positive 17928 pIm wondering whether there is a way to find out the space available for Views within a layout.p  pTo be a little more precise in the activity two TextViews are displayed side by side. As the second one contains pretty much text, Id like to check, whether this text can be displayed on the screen or whether its too large. If thats the case Ill display a smaller version of the text instead as Android doesnt display this text on multiple lines by default. Currently Im using some code like thisp  precodeWindowManager windowManager  WindowManager getSystemServiceWINDOWSERVICE Display display  windowManager.getDefaultDisplay Point screenSize  new Point display.getSizescreenSize int screenWidth  screenSize.x  if tvTitle.getWidth  tvDescription.getWidth gt screenWidth      tvDescrition.setTextgetStringR.string.descritptionshort  codepre  pBut this doesnt work the widths normally are smaller than the screen, so the long version is used. But the text isnt displayed completely, the last words are always missing.p  pI guess the problem is, that the layout is using a padding and is therefore reducing the space really available.p  pSo how to fix this Any ideas are extremely welcome p

So the math I did was 105 x 6 6 slides. This gave me 630 pixels. With the slide margins, it has a total of 4 pixels for the right and left together. So I did 4 x 6 which equals 24. Then added them together. 630  24  654 pixels. I thought my programming was off, but its the same either way. But for some odd reason it will only go on one line if the width is 671 pixels 17 greater. I tried a width of 110 pixels for each slide, but then the container following the same math had to have 20 extra pixels. So it changes over time so I cant just add 17 pixels randomly for my equation.p  pIm not sure whats going on. Thanks for any helpp

What makes it really difficult for me is that I have to be able to calculate OT by the state it was collected in by essentially tracking which entry ordered by entrydate pushes the users regular hours over 40 and then make sure I begin totaling the OT for the state the particular job is in jobstate.p  pFor example, if an works his first 35 hours for the week in a job in NC and then spends the next 15 on job in SC, the report would have to show something like the followingp  pEmployee Name  Job State  Reg Hours  OT Hoursp  pSmith, John  NC  35  0p  pSmith, John  SC  5  10p  pAnd if you were to say that after he worked the 15 hours on the SC job, he began working on another job in NC he would have to begin accruing OT in NC next, since he would already be over 40 regular hours in a week.  In the event that John Smith finished the week by working an additional 15 hours in NC his final report would look likep  pEmployee Name  Job State  Reg Hours  OT Hoursp  pSmith, John  NC  35  15p  pSmith, John  SC  5  10p  pIm pretty sure that this is something that cannot be accomplished using regular SQL.  Would I have to use a UDF or something like that to accomplish this task  Considering that I can rather easily get an employees entries using a simple query, am I able dump the result set into the UDF to process and then output my desired result  If not, would I just have to include and execute the SQL statement within the UDFp  pIf anyone has any thoughts on the best way I might accomplish this task, Id greatly appreciate it.p  pMikep

Negative 17928 pIm working with a C plugin architecture. Plugins are DLLs which expose a bunch of presenters, which are objects that implement the IPresenter interface. The IPresenter interface is available in a DLL shared by all plugins.  Presenters can also implement additional methods as defined by IAction interfaces, like ILoadAction, ISaveAction etc. These interfaces are also shared by the same DLL so all plugins can have presenters that implement such interfaces.p  pCase I have presenter X in plugin A which implements the IPresenter interface and the ILoadAction interface. In plugin B, I ask the plugin architecture to give me a presenter X. This gives me an iIPresenteri object. To call the LoadAction method of that presenter, I have to cast the presenter to ILoadAction.p  pProblem if I remove ILoadAction from presenter X in plugin A, the code in plugin B will still compile even though the presenter doesnt implement ILoadAction anymore.

Negative 17928 pOur app has a WPF FlowDocumentScrollViewer that shows a flowdocument with text in three font colors Lavender, FFFFFFE8, and Orange.  The background of the Viewer is set to transparent, with the window behind it having a Black background.  This works fine for everybody except for one customer.  For him, the Lavender colored text shows up as white, and the text that should be the other two colors shows up as black.  Black text is hard to read against a black background.p  pI imagine there is some windows setting that is causing the font colors to be displayed in black and white on his computer.  Can anyone please point me to the correct setting  And is there anyway to override this behavior in the xaml or code behindp

If I seek to that frame, and send it, the picture gets messed up because the decoder needs a IDR to decode it properly, so I resorted to finding the appropriate IDR in this case one with the time 1 and sending it as the frame with the time 4. So now the picture is decoded properly, all is well... but... If my GOV is 32, and I need to send the non IDR frame that has the index 31, and if the time span between it and the corresponding IDR is 3 seconds, I actually get 3 seconds earlier then the time I want. Now, this is not precise, because I cannot seek to the half of the GOV time span. Also, I cant set smaller GOV, so I want other ideas...p  pMy other idea was to send the last known IDR, and then send all other non IDR frames that come before the one I want, only I would set for all of them RTPTIME to be the same as the corresponding IDR. In this case the picture gets decoded perfectly, but now in the above case, 3 seconds that follow non IDR frame with the wanted time get fast paced in the decoderplayer there is no instantaneous seek...p  pAny ideas Or I can only seek to IDRs and not the frames in betweenp

Negative 17928 pWe have a VB6 application that uses the codevbprndlg.dllcode library to show print selection dialogs to the user.

Negative 17928 pHi I am trying to workout the best implementationapproach to the following problemp  pI have customers using our win forms application which has a plugin which will connect to the Azure Queue to check if there are awaiting invoices for the connecting customer at pre conf intervals. If there is then the plugin will download the invoices into the customers local db. There are lots of customers using this application so all of them will connect to the queue. They will all need to download their own invoicesp  pHow I thought of implementing this was by having named queues for each customer the customer GUID will identify the queue. So all the customers will use the same Account keyname to connect to the queue. Now the problem with this is that each customer has the account keyname in the dll which they can reflect and retrieve smart customers. So is there a way I can encrypt the keyname or is there a better solution that somebody can suggestp

Negative 17928 pWikipedia provides a hrefhttpssecure.wikimedia.orgwikipediaenwikiCrosssitescriptingExploitscenariosinformation about one of the most common scenariosa for exploiting a reflected cross site scripting attack  using some degree of social engineering to induce unsuspecting users to click a malicious linkp  blockquote   ol   liAlice often visits a particular website, which is hosted by Bob. Bobs   website allows Alice to log in with a   usernamepassword pair and stores   sensitive data, such as billing   information.li   liMallory observes that Bobs website contains a reflected XSS   vulnerability.li   liMallory crafts a URL to exploit the vulnerability, and sends Alice an   email, enticing her to click on a link   for the URL under false pretenses.   This URL will point to Bobs website,   but will contain Mallorys malicious   code, which the website will reflect.li   liAlice visits the URL provided by Mallory while logged into Bobs   website.li   liThe malicious script embedded in the URL executes in Alices browser,   as if it came directly from Bobs   server this is the actual XSS   vulnerability. The script can be used   to send Alices session cookie to   Mallory. Mallory can then use the   session cookie to steal sensitive   information available to Alice   authentication credentials, billing   info, etc. without Alices knowledge.li   ol blockquote  pNow, this is usually tends to be very good example when the website happens to be a pagedriven application  the vulnerability is exploited by getting the user to submit a malicious payload to the application more importantly, by issuing a GET request when logged in which is reflected back in the response.p  pAre there any more interesting attack vectors, especially ones to consider when the application utilizes a lot of AJAX with most of the requests being made over HTTP POST p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIn case I wasnt clear, Id like to know the various types of attacks vectors applicable to reflected XSS attacks, especially when the clientside tier of the application is implemented differently. Pagebased applications would have an attack vector involving HTTP GET requests issued from a user, but it would be interesting to know how this plays out for thick client applications especially the ones using XMLHttpRequest objects that issue HTTP POST requests. Different mechanisms used in clientside rendering will obviously warrant study of different attack vectors. In some cases, there might not be any applicable attack vectors the question is expressed to elicit such a response.p

Also I saw drawFocusRing for the context of the canvas, however that didnt seem to resolve the issue.p  pCurrently I tested on Android stock browser 2.2 MyTouch 3Gp

Negative 17928 pIm trying to render a 3D ribbon using a single 3D cubic Bzier curve to describe it the width of the ribbon is some constant.  The first and last control points have a normal vector associated with them which are always perpendicular to the tangents at those points, and describe the surface normal of the ribbon at those points, and Im trying to smoothly interpolate the normal vector over the course of the curve.p  pFor example, given a curve which forms the letter C, with the first and last control points both having surface normals pointing upwards, the ribbon should start flat, parallel to the ground, slowly turn, and then end flat again, facing the same way as the first control point.

Negative 17928 pWere developing a .Net application with the following architecture presentation layer using MVC pattern with ASP.Net MVC 2, service layer, data access layer using repository pattern over Entity Framework.p  pWeve decided to put the transaction management in the service layer but were not sure about how to implement it. We want to control the transaction entirely at the service layer level. That is, every time a controller calls a method in the service layer, it has to be an atomic operation regarding database updates.p  pIf there were no relation between different services provided in the service layer, then it would be simple each method should commit the changes at the end of its execution that is, call the save method on the context it uses. But sometimes services at the service layer work together.p  pe.g. we provide a shipment service that has a confirm method which receives the following parameters the shipment id, a flag indicating if it corresponds to a new customer or an existing one, the customer id in case the shipment confirmation is for an existing customer and a customer name in case it is for a new customer. If the flag is set to new customer, then the service layer has to a create the customer and b confirm the shipment. For a the shipment service calls the customer service which already implements the validations and logic needed to create a new customer and store it in the database.p  pWho should commit the changes in this scenariop  ul liShould the customer service do it it cannot commit the changes after creating the new customer, because something can go wrong later in the shipment confirmation method, but it has to commit its changes in the case it is call directly in other use case, provided to create a client.li liShould the controller calling the service method do it but the controller shouldnt know anything about transactions, weve decided to put all transaction knowladge in the service layer.li liA Transaction Manager in the services layer How to design it, who calls it and whenli ul  pIs there a design pattern for this that we should followp

When I leave edit mode, any cells that were off screen when I go to normal mode still have the vertical line it doesnt get hidden. Also, now that Ive added the imageView for the checkmark indicator, any cells that are off screen when switching modes gain the checkmark. only section 0 sets it up.p  pIve also noticed that if i do cell.setNeedsDisplay, the text label and detail text label wont update if the data source has been updated. I have to do [self.tableView reloadData] which skips any active animations.p  pIm sure these issues are related to me using a custom cell  dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier, but I cant find exactly what.p  pAny feedback or a push in the right direction would be appreciated.p  pEdit Not using reusable cells seems to have resolved the above issues. Im still open to feedback on the cell code. I forgot one other issue that may or may not be related.  One of my cells has a tap to view list button. If I enter data into the cells while in edit mode, then hit that button to choose some info from a list it displays a modal table view, when I dismiss the modal view, all of the cells edited data has reverted to their original state. Im not calling reload data when I dismiss the modal view controller. I thought this might be fixed by not using reusable cells but it isnt.p
Negative 17928 pFirst I thought that the problem will be very easy to solve, but it proved to be a challenge.p  pstrongScenariostrong One FrameLayout and two ImageViews, one over the other. The first images has a Translate animation and a onClick event. Lets translate this in something practical the Framelayout has one Rabbit image and a Bush image. The Rabbit has a translate animation so it moves out of the bush. As soon as the rabbit becomes visible, the user can tap on it. Unfortunately this does not work as intended. Even if the rabbit is not visible being behind the bush if the user taps on the bush, the click event of the rabbit fires. I tried to add onClick event that doesnt do anything for the bush image, but now only this one fires, and the rabbit ones doesnt.p  pstrongCodestrongp  pAnimationp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt lttranslate     xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidfromXDelta0     androidtoXDelta100     androidfromYDelta0     androidtoYDelta0     androidduration25000     androidzAdjustmenttop gt codepre  pLayoutp  precode ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltFrameLayout  xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid               androidididlayBackground               androidorientationhorizontal               androidlayoutwidthfillparent               androidlayoutheightfillparent               androidlayoutweight1               androidbackgrounddrawablesomeimagegt                         ltImageView androidididimgAfterBush                                  androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                                  androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                                  androidlayoutgravitybottomleft                                  androidlayoutmarginLeft50dip                                  androidonClickimgAfterBushOnClickgt                        ltImageView androidididimgBush                                  androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                                  androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                                  androidsrcdrawablebush                                  androidlayoutgravitybottomleft                                 gt ltFrameLayoutgt codepre  pI want the onClick event of the Rabbit image to fire only when it is visible.

Negative 17928 pIm writing an app in which user can register. While registering the one may choose several options and according to these regiester fields are visible or not and are required or not.  I came up with an idea that all fields will be in in the updatePanel and when users changes registration options I would set visibility of these fields on the server side. p  pIt works but incredibly slow and whats more on the FF I have the given errorp  blockquote   pThe state information is invalid for   this page and might be corruptedp blockquote  p3 checkboxes with other fields are in the updatePanelp  pEach field is in dl tag with coderunatservergtcodep  pI had to do it like that cause for required option I simply add css class to this dl need in in javascript validation. If field should be visible I set visiblefalse for given dl and then that field for example FirstName with title and so on isn visible after postback.p  pAm I doing something wrong  Why does it take so long 4 min on localhost and in firefox it doesnt really work when I use debug I think that process completes without errors on ff, I dont understand that at all p  pIf update Panel is so weak what would be other option to change visibility and adding required class to all dls. Logic is quite complicated and has to make query to DB so simple javascript would be quite tricky.p  pThanks for any hints,p  pOh and Im using ASP.Net and cant upgrade on this project.p  pThanks for help, byep

Negative 17928 pI have a python tool to touch utime a file, then move to another folder. However, if the file already exists in the destination folder, it is silently overwritten. I would like to check for a file of the same name in the destination folder and, if it exists, rename the one I am moving to its name plus emnem at the end, where emnem is a number starting at 1 and, if the file with 1 at the end already exists, 2 etc.br For example, say in the source folder is a file foo.txt, but there is one foo.txt in the destination folder as well. This function should return absolute pathfoob1b.txt.p  pSo, I have made a function to check for these circumstances and return the modified string, so I can use rename later and not overwrite. However, currently, if the file exists, it returns nothing.

Negative 17928 pFrom an earlier post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6114722uitableviewonlyshowinguitableviewcellswithdataUITableView, only showing UITableViewCells with dataa, I was able to resize my UITableView accordingly.  I do this resizing in the method p  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  codepre  pI declare a CGRect originalFrame to hold my original tableView size because I was getting a problem where if I went from smaller to larger rows i.e. 1 to 5 rows, the 5 rows would then show in 1 row space only instead of the 5.  So in my viewDidLoad method, I reset the tableView.frame to the originalFrame.  It pretty much works.  However, the nuance I see now is, it still remembers the last selection when loading the table, then when you touch the table, it reloads correctly.  For example, lets say I am showing 3 rows of data, then I move to a selection that has 5 rows of data.  When the UITableView reloads, it first only shows 3 rows worth of data, then when I touch the UITableView, the next two rows magically appear, and it works like normal.  It only happens if I go from smaller to larger.  If I start out at a selection that has 5 rows of data, it looks fine.  Then I go to a smaller selection that has 3 rows of data, then it automatically resizes to 3 rows.  Any thoughts  Am I not redrawing at the right time  Am I putting my resizing in the right placep

Negative 17928 pI am writing a compiler more for fun than anything else, but I want to try to make it as efficient as possible.  For example I was told that on Intel architecture the use of any  register other than codeEAXcode for performing math incurs a cost presumably because it swaps into codeEAXcode to do the actual piece of math. Here is at least one source that states the possibility httpwww.swansontec.comsregisters.html.p  pI would like to verify and measure these differences in performance characteristics. Thus, I have written this program in Cp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltintrin.hgt include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      int64 startval     int64 stopval     unsigned int value  Keep the value to keep from it being optomized out      startval  rdtsc  Get the CPU Tick Counter using assembly RDTSC opcode       Simple Math a  a ltlt 3  0x0054E9     asm          mov ebx, 0x1E532  Seed         shl ebx, 3         add ebx, 0x0054E9         mov value, ebx           stopval  rdtsc     int64 val  stopval  startval     cout ltlt Result  ltlt value ltlt  gt  ltlt val ltlt endl      int i     cin gtgt i      return 0  codepre  pI tried this code swapping codeeaxcode and codeebxcode but Im not getting a stable number.  I would hope that the test would be deterministic the same number every time because its so short that its unlikely a context switch is occurring during the test.  As it stands there is no statistical difference but the number fluctuates so wildly that it would be impossible to make that determination. Even if I take a large number of samples the number is still impossibly varied.p  pId also like to test codexor eax, eaxcode vs codemov eax, 0code, but have the same problem.p  pIs there any way to do these kinds of performance tests on Windows or anywhere else When I used to program Z80 for my TICalc I had a tool where I could select some assembly and it would tell me how many clock cycles to execute the code  can that not be done with our newfangeled modern processorsp  pEDIT There are a lot of answers indicating to run the loop a million times.  To clarify, this actually makes things worse. The CPU is much more likely to context switch and the test becomes about everything but what I am testing.p

Negative 17928 pIn Haskell, a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiIterateeIOIteratee based IOa seems very attractive. Iteratees are a composable, safe, fast ways of doing IO inspired by the fold a.k.a. reduce function in functional languages.  Basically, if you have a traversal the idea is to encapsulate the traversal state into a socalled enumerator who calls the iteratee which is in turn a function either returning a value or a request for more data along with a continuation for the enumerator to call. So only the enumerator knows the state of the traversal while the iteratee knows what to do with the data and builds values out of it. The nice thing about it is that iteratees are automatically composable, where output of one iteratee is fed to another to make a bigger one.p  pSo, two questions p  ul liDoes the concept even make sence in other languages, like plain object oriented languages or is it only useful for overcoming the shortcomings of Haskells lazy IOli liAre there any actual implementations for other languages, especially C as that is what my company uses A google search turns up one mention of iteratees in Scala well, Im not that interested in Scala right now. li ul

Negative 17928 pSo here is the problem. I have a common class library that holds all the repositories, domain and mapping files so the library can be reused within other web beased applications.

Negative 17928 pIm new to Android and Im having the following problem. Im writing a sample application where I have an intent service that first checks all location providers to get the last known location. If none of the last known locations provides an accurate or timely enough location then the location managers requestLocationUpdates method is called with a BroadcastReceiver intent. Each time the broadcast receivers onReceive method is called it should check the location to see if it is accurate andor timely enough. I also have a TimerTask in the intent service that eventually goes off and should check to see if an accurate andor timely enough location update has been obtained. The problem Im having is that I dont know how to get the location data obtained in the broadcast receiver back to the intent service. Seems like this should be an easy thing to do but Ive been agonizing over this for days. The only way I can think to do it is to write the data to an SQLite db in the broadcast receiver and then read those records back in the intent service, but this seems unnecessarily complicated. Does anyone know what the right way is to get the data back to the intent service Should I even be using a broadcast receiver for requestLocationUpdates Is there an easier way to do this  Here is the codep  precodepublic class GetLocationService extends IntentService       public GetLocationService          supersomething           LocationManager locationManager     long maxFixLateness     float maxFixPosUncertainty     boolean usableLocObtained     Location bestLoc  null     float bestLocScore  0     Intent locChangeI     PendingIntent pLocChangeI      Override     final protected void onHandleIntentIntent intent          maxFixLateness  30000         maxFixPosUncertainty  30         long curTime  System.currentTimeMillis         LocationManager locationManager  LocationManager this                 .getSystemServiceContext.LOCATIONSERVICE          Check for a usable location fix         Listltstringgt matchingProviders  locationManager.getAllProviders         for String provider  matchingProviders              Location location  locationManager.getLastKnownLocationprovider             if location  null                   ...some code to check if the location is accurate or timely                  enough                               if bestLoc  null              locChangeI  new Intentthis, HandleLocationUpdateReceiver.class             pLocChangeI  PendingIntent.getBroadcastthis, 0, locChangeI,                     PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT             usableLocObtained  false             locationManager.requestLocationUpdates                     LocationManager.NETWORKPROVIDER, 0, 0, pLocChangeI             locationManager.requestLocationUpdates                     LocationManager.GPSPROVIDER, 0, 0, pLocChangeI              Call the timer that will periodically check to see if a usable              location has been obtained.             new LocFixCheckTimer60000, 30, 1000                    private class LocFixCheckTimer           Timer timer         long numChecks          public LocFixCheckTimerlong initSearchTime, long maxRechecks,                 long recheckFreq              numChecks  maxRechecks             timer  new Timer              Wait 2 seconds before checking for a fix again             timer.schedulenew CheckLocTask, initSearchTime, recheckFreq                   class CheckLocTask extends TimerTask               public void run                  if numChecks gt 0                      if usableLocObtained  true                           I want to use the location data obtained from the                          HandleLocationUpdateReceivers onReceive method                          but I dont how to get that data here.                                       else                       Cancel the timer.

 pI think Ive found the reason for my problem.p  pBased on suggestions from SLaks, I reexamined the strongX.Designer.csstrong file associated with my UserControl. There were several other controls checkbox, labels, etc declared in X.Designer.cs, but that did not actually appear in the UI. I suspect that while I was developing my UserControl using the WinForm editor, I probably went thru several cycles of addingremoving child controls, and at some point some of these child controls were orphaned in the X.Designer.cs file. I went back to a nonlocalized version of my UserControl strongLocalizable  Falsestrong, then deleted all the orphaned child controls, then recompiled, then open the UserControl in the WinForm Designer, then set Localizable back to True, and saved everything. This seems to be working now. Ill update this in the future if this ends up not being the solution.p

Negative 17928 pI was trying to throw a quick WCF WebAPI project together up on AppHarbor tonight and ran into some issues. The WCF API is couched inside an empty MVC3 project just like is demod on the WCF CodePlex site. a hrefhttpsgithub.comjptotoPostmarkResponseCodeGenerator relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjptotoPostmarkResponseCodeGeneratora The API itself is quite basic, when you type an http response error code on the end of the url the response will be the proper error code. So, for example, using a hrefhttpresponsecodes.appharbor.comapiresponse405 relnofollowhttpresponsecodes.appharbor.comapiresponse405a in Fiddler or some other http client will return the proper error response for a 405 error. This API is just a convenient way to test with proper error responses.p  pAnyway, no matter what I try I get 404 errors from AH. I cant tell if the routing isnt working on what. When I download the built code from AH and run it locally inside IIS it runs fine, no problem.p  pIf AH just doesnt support some kind of routing that is in WebAPI Preview 6 thats fine. I just want to cover all my bases. Thanksp

Negative 17928 pIs there a unix service, or at least one I could cobble together, for storing a plaintext password for a PHP web applicationp  pIn composing this question, I found that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma7258186151841c provides a servicea for storing passwords in an encrypted format. p  pI have to store plaintext passwords because the application is connecting to various ftp servers. Not all of these servers are configured to use public keys. The two vectors Im looking to protect against are database dumps and someone getting the plaintext password from a file on the filesystem.p  pI was wondering if there is some way that the server OS itself can store an encrypted string for the user that the app is running under  codeapachecode, codewwwdatacode or whomever. I understand that such a system is still vulnerable to someone getting the access to those accounts, or uploading malicious PHP scripts, but I feel that with our current practices, those are acceptable risks. I am just looking not to store the plaintext password in the db or on the filesystem. p

Negative 17928 pOne problem that I am facing is having many queries with similar select statements but different joinwhere statements. p  pBelow is an example of a code that I am working on via CodeIgniter. What I normally do is make one function, get, that accepts an array of random keysvalues. Depending on what keysvalues are passed, it will generate and run the appropriate query. Now, I am wondering is this a good way of doing things Because as you can see, this function becomes more and more complex. Initially, I had a bunch of functions such as getall, getonlylessons, etc but it becomes kinda annoying having to repeat the same set of code with one or two lines that are different.p  pMy question is what is the best way with dealing with this problem.p  precodefunction getparam  NULL           SELECT  m.id AS id, CASTm.ordernumber AS SIGNED AS ordernumber, m.name AS name, m.permalink as permalink,          m.suplessonid as suplessonid, CASTsm.ordernumber AS SIGNED AS suplessonordernumber     FROM    lessons m     JOIN    courses c ON m.courseid  c.id     LEFT JOIN lessons sm ON m.suplessonid  sm.id     WHERE   [various]           select    m.id AS id, CASTm.ordernumber AS SIGNED AS ordernumber, m.name AS name, m.permalink as permalink,      select .  m.suplessonid as suplessonid      if issetparam[id]  issetparam[suplessonordernumber]  issetparam[permalink]            select . , CASTsm.ordernumber AS SIGNED AS suplessonordernumber       thisgtdbgtselectselect     thisgtdbgtfromthisgttablename. m     thisgtdbgtjointhisgtcoursestablename. c, m.courseid  c.id      if issetparam[id]  issetparam[suplessonordernumber]  issetparam[permalink]         thisgtdbgtjointhisgttablename. sm, m.suplessonid  sm.id, left       where clauses     if issetparam[courseid]          thisgtdbgtwherearrayc.id gt param[courseid]     if issetparam[id]          thisgtdbgtwherearraym.id gt param[id]     if issetparam[ordernumber]          thisgtdbgtwherearraym.ordernumber gt param[ordernumber]     if issetparam[permalink]          thisgtdbgtlikem.permalink, param[permalink], none     if issetparam[suplessonid]          thisgtdbgtwherearraym.suplessonid gt param[suplessonid]     if issetparam[suplessonordernumber]          thisgtdbgtwherearraysm.ordernumber gt param[suplessonordernumber]     if issetparam[NULL]          thisgtdbgtwherem..param[NULL].

Negative 17928 pI am working on a simple grid in ASP.NET using jTable www.jTable.org. Its a page with a list of Residents, where theres a field called FacilityFrom populated from a FACILITY table in the database. On the Residents jTable I have a field that is using the options attribute and pulling from the Facility SQL table. I just want a drop down list where the first amp default value is NONE when you go to add a new record.p  pI did some MSSQL magic and creating a record representing a default value its field in the database is literally NONE.

Negative 17928 pOne of our procedures lets users bulkinsert related records by picking a view and then hitting a ribbon button.

Once a view is selected, the number of results provided is lte 5k is shown. p  pWhen a plugin runs the very same fetchxml server side Retrieve of userquery or savedquery, then Retrieve  FetchExpression, the results change. We get not only a different number of records but also some records are different.p  pWe concluded that the issue has to do with timezones. Some filters included onorafter operators along with date values.  Examplep  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltfilter typeandgt   ltcondition attributemodifiedon operatoronorafter value20110101 gt   ltcondition attributemodifiedon operatoronorbefore value20111231 gt ltfiltergt codepre  pThe plugin ran as admin. Changing the plugin user has no effect  as if the current user timezone is not considered when pulling out records from the CRM using a FetchExpression.p  pHow can I ensure that a fetchxml expression returns the same results clientside and serversidep  pProbably related a hrefhttpsocial.microsoft.comForumsencrmdevelopmentthread0f0e4e97c97a4bc9af4aa5f729ca30f2 relnofollowMSDN threada.p  pThanks for your time.p  pEdit following Daryls suggestion, I ran a SQL trace. Results are puzzling. Dates are correctly offset for clientside queries ran from CRM, i.e. Advanced Find  this means the fetchxml is correctly translated using the users timezone settings. This does not happen for the same query, serverside the output SQL contains the date filters asis, with no timezone offset. I assumed the same translation happened no matter the origin of the query execution context.p  pEdit 2 A flag in an hidden region of code my last debugging resort was preventing the plugin from instantiating the service in the running users context. Everything runs fine now. Thanks everyone for your time and your help, its much appreciated.p

Negative 17928 pIm curious as to exactly how this feature works. Consider something likep  precodestduniqueptrltintgt f  stduniqueptrltintgt lvalnullptr return lval  codepre  pThis code compiles fine even for a moveonly type, as the compiler implicitly moves it. But logically, for any return expression, determining whether or not the result refers to a local variable would be solving the Halting Problem and if the compiler simply treated all local variables as rvalues in the return expression, then this would be problematic as the variable may be referred to in that one expression multiple times. Even if a local only had one emdirectem reference, you would not be able to prove that it did not have other indirect aliases.p  pSo how does the compiler know when to move from the return expressionp

Negative 17928 pI am a beginner python programmer, and I am working on a selenium project in python 2.7.  p  pI have a generic scraper script, that basically outlines what I want to do with all the websites that I visit.  However, because of the nature of the data that I want to grab, I cant run the same code on each site each site needs to run its own individual code.  p  pI have attempted to solve this by importing inside of an if statement, and this is the solution I came up with p  precodesite  False if sourcewebsite  Website A     from websitea import      site  True elif sourcewebsite  Website B     from websiteb import      site  True else     print This is not an acceptable website  if site  True      main code block     driver  driversetupchrome     driver.getsourcewebsiteURL     stufftosave  dosomestuffdriver     xmlfilestufftosave     driver.quit codepre  pwhere the codewebsiteacode and codewebsitebcode modules both have functions named codedosomestuffcode, and they do stuff specific to the website that theyre on.  Now, this seems to work, for the most part. I also seem to be able to extend functionality to any number of websites, given that I program a module called codewebsiteccode with the function codedosomestuffcode, and add that to the conditional import.p  pSo, my question is, is this a good idea Is there a better way to do something like thisp  pI have literally never seen anyone wrap import statements inside of if statements like this and generally, if no one seems to do it, theres usually a good reason why.  p

Negative 17928 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCMdt9.png altMockup of the controlp  pIn my WPF Application after a user input I am displaying a dashboard to present the outputs of the users data.p  pNow what I want to have is a control like above, where the blue fills the segment from left to right. e.g. if the value returned is 100, the blue fills the whole segment and if it is 0 then there is no blue shown.p  pIts very easy to create this using normal rectangles but the curves are a challenge. For reference with rectangles it works that, on a button click a value is created in the range of 0100 and then I multiply this by the ratio of rectangle widthMax value. then set the rectangles width equal to this.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 17928 pI have an application where I have a shared resource a Motion system which can be accessed by multiple clients.  I have individual Operations that require access to the system for the duration of the move and which should throw Busy exceptions if conflicting operations are requested at the same time.  I also have Sequencers which need to acquire exclusive access to the Motion system for the execution of several Operations, interspersed with other actions during the entire sequence, no other clients should be able to run Operations.p  pIve traditionally approached this using Threadaffinity, so that a Thread can request exclusive access and run blocking calls corresponding to operations.  While the Thread has access, no other Threads may use the resource.  The problem Im having now is that Ive moved toward implementing my system using asyncawait patterns, to allow cleaner sequencer implementation.  The problem is that now my sequencer is not always running on the same thread the active thread can change during the course of callbacks, so it is no longer easy to determine whether I am in a valid context to keep running operations.  One item of note is that some of the Operations themselves are composed of awaits, which means both sequences and individual Operations can span multiple threads.p  pMy question does anybody know of a good pattern to deal with acquiring exclusive access in the presence of thread switching due to asyncawaitp  pFor reference, a few things Ive consideredp  ol lipI could create a custom SynchronizationContext that marshals all sequencer calls for the duration of a sequence back to a single Thread.  This has the benefit of allowing me to reuse my existing threadaffinity access management code.  The downside is that this will require dedicating a Thread whenever I do either a Sequence or an Operation since Operations can also span multiple threads.pli lipCreate an acquirable access token to pass to the Operation methods to prove that you have acquired access.  This has the downside of bloating the methods with a token parameter.pli lipUse the access token approach from 2, but create a duplicate interface implementation for the Operations interface so a wrapper can be instantiated with the token bakedin.  This creates some ugly glue code, but it cleans up the sequencer code so that it no longer needs to pass a token to each method.pli ol

Negative 17928 pI am reviewing my code from since I picked up on JSF. One of the most complex issues has come up once again. The decision between CDI and EJB.p  pI am using three layers and I wonder which type of annotation to use on each of them  Backing beans the Controller as defined in MVC  The service layer  DAOsp  pMy backing beans are using CDI, as long as I dont need anything from EJB. But I am stuck on those other two. I remember reading about using EJB beans because of the pooling functionalities, which would prevent massive loads of requests or attacks, if you will. So in short, is there ANY reason to use EJB Stateless, Stateful, LocalBean et cetera, considering security or anything else excluded ViewScopedp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 17928 pI store more than just source code in my subversion repos. I would like to have a search tool which handled doc, doxc, xls, xlsx, pdf, etc... like what a hrefhttparcetis.voilasvn.commainENproducts.html relnofollowVoilaSVNa did, however it appears to have dropped off the end of the earthp  pForcing a checkout of the entire repo and use a local to the PC search indexer is one option, but due to the size of the repo it is not practical. Also this has the drawback that it will only provide results on the revision of SVN that the working copy is at.p  pAre there any tools out there which use something like Lucene to index more than just plain text within SVN I would prefer open source, but I would consider a proprietary solution.p

Negative 17928 pThis question regards website programming. My primary languages are cc and I dont know much about web development, except that say I understand html and css.

It contains the fields title, authors and publication date. p  pI would like to create a simple website with a search box that has this dynamic result feature, so that you get suggestions after you type in a few letters.

All those search modules search the entire website and I only need to search the database. p

Negative 17928 pbr A few weeks ago I came up with and idea to develop a mobile app which will direct students in my university to the nearest printer availiable. The whole thing is part of my final project. br The Android based app will need to perform the following tasks brp  ol liThe users location in the campus is sent to the server. Assume this part works just fine.li liThe server sends an SNMP request to the printers in the users vicinity. Ill probably use PHP or Python for that part. li liThe data requested by SNMP is processed and sent back to the clientli ol  pbr My question concerns the server. The universitys IT manager offered me a designated server for development, which sounds great. Now I need to choose which OS I want installed on the server  Windows server or Linux dont know which versions. I dont have any server programmingoperating experince, but  generally speaking I feel more comfortable in Windows enviroment just because that has always been my OS. br I dont have an awful lot of time for learning a new OS, but if Linux is better suited for the project I described, maybe I will. Which server would you recommand in this case br Thank you.p

Negative 17928 pMy question is hopefully very simple but I cant seem to get the flow of data correct. The issue is how to pass texture coordinates and normal data from a vertex shader through the tessellation stages Hull and Domain shader and into the pixel shader for rendering. p  pThe problem I am encountering is that before the use of tesselation the data could simply be passed from vertex to pixel shader. There is now multiple steps between these two shaders a patch constant function the hull shader and then the domain shader. p  pIf anyone can give me some insight into how to pass data through each of these sections , and if possible maybe some quick pseudo code to demonstrate it, Id be very thankful. If you need more information, or my current code even though it doesnt work, just let me know.p  pExtra information The program is written in C using DirectX 11 api using HLSL.p

Negative 17928 pI have a problem with controlling queue of threads. My application uses MySQL database to read parts of data, processing it and showing results on screen. There is about 20 tasks in queue, but only one is processing at once. Also user might cancel current queue, and ask for another part of data from database. Now Im using ThreadPoolExecutor with discard oldest policy, because I am removing oldest part of data from queue, and replace it with new part, when user wants it. My problem is that even if corePoolSize is set to 1, sometimes there are 4 threads running at once. I dont know how to cleanly empty queue of notstarted tasks. Now Im using getQueue and removing all items from list, but I read it is bad way. Also before adding new task to queue I want to check if there is no such taskwith the same part of data in queue and I have no idea how to achieve that. p  pConcludingbr 1. Is there any way to force ThreadPoolExecutor to run just 1 task at oncebr 2. How to check queue to prevent duplicates of tasks they are distinguished by String valuebr 3. How to remove cleanly old tasks from queue p  pOr maybe I should use some other mechanismp  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 17928 pI have a project, where im working with a lot of generics but also require typesafety. Since the stacktrace is at about 200 calls, when the current error appears, im afraid that i can not deliver the complete sourcecode that is involved. Ill try to scratch it down to the problems i have spotted so far and deliver a brief example.p  pFirst, there are classes, holding generic values. Each generic implements Comparable. That might be a Long, a Boolean  or even custom Classes implementing this interface.p  pEach of such  a class has a DatabaseID, wich is a enumentry that contains a default value of a certain type. strongMOST the timestrong this DatabaseIds Default Value is of the same type as the GenericClass of the Holdingclass.p  pSomething like thisp  precodepublic enum DatabaseId    ALONGVALUE0L,    ABOOLEANVALUEfalse,    AINTERVAL  codepre  pInterval is such a custom class implementing the Comparable interface. But also Interval is an exception from the above mentioned rule. The GenericHolding Class for intervals has a generic Type T of Interval.class, while the DatabaseValue that persists the Interval stores it as a string. like code[5,250]code or code[5]code for discrete values.p  pNow, at some point, i need to load the value that is stored behind a Database id and inject it into the holdings class CurrentValue Attribute.p  pSince this is done on a very parent class of the whole hierarchy this is done in a generic way alsop  precode    public void initialize      Database db  Database.getInstance     try          this.setValueT db.getthis.getDatabaseId      catch Exception ex          Log.eLOGTAG, Invalid cast while initializing Value Holder., ex         this.setValuenull       codepre  pFor the mentioned Example, where a ValueHoler is holding codeInterval.classcode and the DatabaseId id delivering an codeStringcode, this will strongobviouslystrong fail. At this point, im expecting an Exception, because im trying to cast an codeObjectcode db.get delivers codeObjectcode to the generic Type codeTcode which is codeIntervalcode in this example. The real type of the Database Entry however is codeStringcode.p  pstrongButstrong No Exception is thrown, so the codesetValuenullcode is never executed. The Application contionues until a point, where codeValueHolder.getCurrentvaluecode is called and used to compare it with another value of the same Type i expect codecurrentValuecode to be. codeIntervalcode in this casep  precodethis.getCurrentValue.containsIntervalthis.getRequiredValue codepre  pAt this point, JAVA notices that CurrentValue is a String, and throws an Exceptionp  blockquote   pjava.lang.ClassCastException java.lang.String cannot be cast to   my.namespace.Intervalp blockquote  pstrongThe Actual problemstrongp  pI can easily catch this szenario, like thisp  precodepublic void initialize      Database db  Database.getInstance     try          if this.getValueHolderValueType  Interval.class           Interval has an constructor for the string represenatation of it                           this.setValueT new IntervalStringdb.getgetDatabaseId          else             this.setValueT db.getthis.getDatabaseId               catch Exception ex          Log.eLOGTAG, Invalid cast while initializing valueHolder,ex         this.setValuenull       codepre  pbut if another developer comes along and implements a new Class extending Comparable hell might be not be aware of the manual casting, and ran into the same troubles. p  pWhile writing this, I found a solution to notify the developer, like thisp  pdoing nongenericcasts firstp  pcomparing both typesp  praise notification if Generic cast is not possible.p  precode if this.getValueHolderValueType  Interval.class             this.setValueT new IntervalStringdb.getgetDatabaseId         else if this.getValueHolderValueType  this.getDatabaseId.getType             Log.eLOGTAG, Invalid cast while initializing ValueHolder. DatabaseId delivers this.getDatabaseId.getType, but valueHolder expects this.getValueHolderValueType. Maybe you are missing a nongenericcast right here             else             this.setValueT db.getthis.getDatabaseId          codepre  pstrongSo the only question that remains unansweredstrongp  pstrongWHYstrong is codethis.setValueT db.getthis.getDatabaseIdcode strongNOTstrong raising an exception, when T is of type codeIntervalcode, DatabaseIDs value is of type codeStringcode and db.get is returning an codeObjectcodep  pstrongWHYstrong is the Exception thrown in the moment, when i try to Access the wrong class rather than when im doing the castp

Negative 17928 pFor a custom Eclipse plugin, Ive been looking into creating a perspective that will help organize views in a way that makes work easier for the editors, with the main requirement that we would like to simultaneously see two editor areas in the perspective.p  pOur plugin uses two new editor types A Workflow Editor WE and a Trial Editor TE We would like to make sure that all instances of the WE are opened in one area of the perspective, and all in the TE are opened in a separate area.p  pEssentially, it looks like the perspective whose link is below, except that in place of the Java editing views in the topright, wed have the WE views, and in place of the text editing views in the bottomright, we would have the TE views.p  pa hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu4148918eclipsemultieditor.jpg relnofollowhttpdl.dropbox.comu4148918eclipsemultieditor.jpgap  pI took a look at the tutorial on creating perspectives here a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgarticlesusingperspectivesPerspectiveArticle.html relnofollowhttpwww.eclipse.orgarticlesusingperspectivesPerspectiveArticle.htmla .

Is it select or autocompleteselect  Note that I first tried to go through the jQueryUI source code, but but the string autocompleteselect is never used.  Where is autocompleteselect definedp  pMy next source of confusion is when I put code inside the anonymous function associated with the event.  Does this code always execute first, and then any additional default plugin code associated with the even execute  Will codeevent.preventDefaultcode also prevent the default behaviorp

Negative 17928 pI have a UIPanGestureRecognizer attached to a parent view, with various codeCCSpritecode I want to move around in the parent when panned. Using code[gesture locationOfTouchi inViewrecognizer.view]code I can get the location of the touch but if I assign that to my subviews center it often makes the subview move unexpectedly since the original touch is probably not in the exact center of the sprite. Really what I want is to get the code[gesture translationInViewrecognizer.view]code for each of the touch locations and use that. It works perfect when you only have 1 panning touch, but more then 1 and there appears no way to get translations for them. Because each touch can be panning in a different directonspeed. The user can use 2 fingers to move two different sprite completely independent of each other. [UIPanGestureRecognizer translationInView] doesnt allow me to get the different translations.p  pHow should I do thisp

Negative 17928 pIn most the languages I use, you simply cannot nest block comments, because the first ocurrence of the close comment sintaxis closes the comment even if it was only an inner comment.p  pFor example, in HTMLp  precodelt outer comment ltpgthelloltpgtlt inner comment ltpgtworldltpgt gt ltpgtthis should BE commentedltpgt gt codepre  pin this case, the outer comment ends on the first codegtcode instead of the corresponding last one, causing the last codeltpgtcode to print, when it shouldnt.p  pThe same happens for languages that use code code for block comments, like in java, php, css, javascript, etc.p  pBut my question is WHY is it that way Why, by design, it is not allowed I mention by design because I really doubt it is because of parsing problems, I guess the parsers are perfectly capable of keeping track of opening codecodes and close the comments with their corresponding closing codecodes But they simply somehow decided it is not a good idea.p  pI already know that a workaround for this is to somehow change the inner closing comments, to avoid them to close , and only leave the last closing one. e.g. changing inner codegtcodes and codecodes for code gtcodes and code codes . But that is obviously not convenient, and hard to do when you only want to discard blocks of code for debugging purposes. other techniques are to nest everything in codeiffalsecode blocks, but that is not the point here.p  pSo, what Id like to know is WHY nested comments are generally not allowed in several modern languages there must be a good reason other than others dont do it, we wont either right.p  pAnd as a plus, are there any other not so obscure languages that DO allow nested block commentsp

Negative 17928 pI have a situation in which I would like a method to  work within a transaction, but only if a transaction has not already been started. Heres a contrived example to distill what Im talking aboutp  precodeclass ConductBusinessLogic   def initializeparams     params  params   end    def process     ActiveRecordBase.transaction do       ModelA.createmultipleparams[modela]       ModelB.createmultipleparams[modela]     end   end end  class ModelA lt ActiveRecordBase   def self.createmultipleparams      Id like the below to be more like ensuretransaction     ActiveRecordBase.transaction do       params.each  p createp      end   end end  class ModelB lt ActiveRecordBase   def self.createmultipleparams      Again, a transaction here is only necessary if one has not already been started     ActiveRecordBase.transaction do       params.each  p createp      end   end end codepre  pBasically, I dont want these to act as nested transactions. I want the code.createmultiplecode methods to only start transactions if they are not already called within a transaction, such as through codeConductBusinessLogicprocesscode. If the model methods are called by themselves, they should start their own transaction, but if they are already being called inside a transaction, as through codeConductBusinessLogicprocesscode, they should not nest a subtransaction.p  pI dont know of a way in which Rails provides this out of the box. If I run the above code asis and a rollback is triggered by one of the model methods, the whole transaction will still go through because the subtransaction swallows the codeActiveRecordRollbackcode exception. If I use the coderequiresnewcode option on the subtransactions, savepoints will be used to simulate nested transactions, and only that subtransaction will actually be rolled back. The behavior I would like would be something to the effect of codeActiveRecordBase.ensuretransactioncode, such that a new transaction is started only if there isnt already an outer transaction, so that any subtransaction can trigger a rollback on the entire outer transaction. This would allow these methods to be transactional on their own, but defer to a parent transaction if there is one.p  pIs there a builtin way to achieve this behavior, and if not, is there a gem or patch that will workp

Negative 17928 pIm having many troubles installing WebSitePanel on an Azure Virtual Machine, with Windows Server 2012.  I followed the steps in a hrefhttpwww.websitepanel.netdocumentationdeploymentguideserverconfigurationpreparingwindowsserver2008r2forwebsitepanelinstallation relnofollowhttpwww.websitepanel.netdocumentationdeploymentguideserverconfigurationpreparingwindowsserver2008r2forwebsitepanelinstallationa and installed everything I needed.p  pThen, I installed the WebSitePanel Standalone Server package with the installer.  I opened the endpoint for the port 9002 on Windows Azure so I pointed my browser to myhostname.cloudapp.net note in Azure you dont have a static IP address, instead you have an hostname like [hostname].cloudapp.net.  So, loading myhostname.cloudapp.net9002 fails, and any browser shows something like Unable to load page.

Currently I have no idea how to do this beside doing the whole replacement by myself. I tried to work with the template function to check an attribute. The problem is, that in the template function you can only get a static values as theres no scope yet which can be used to evaluate an expression. p  pOf course I could skip the replace and transclusion stuff and do the replacement in the link function by my self but I wonder if I could somehow avoid this. p

Negative 17928 pThis is my first time using stackoverflow. Sorry if I do anything rude or wrong I wanted to ask about a flowchart Im doing. It just doesnt look right. Ive looked in my textbook for examples, but they dont seem to apply to this particular assignment. The pseudocode is right, because the java is right. But the flowchart just looks wrong. p  pIn this assignment the program is to display an array of items ipod, Xbox, etc. By using an array. The program is to ask the user which items they would like to order. The user is to enter the item. The program displays In Stock. Then the program replaces the item from the array with an empty string. The program asks the user if they would like to make another order. If the user enters in the same item, the message Out of Stock is displayed.If the user enters another item, the same process repeats. While loop Entering the the word No ends the program. p  pYou can see all this in the pseudo code, I just thought writing it all out might be easier. Or not, maybe it just took extra work reading it XP Here is the link to my flowchart and pseudo code if anyone cares to help Sorry, youll have to zoom in to read it.  I had to use a link because Im not allowed to post pictures yet.p  pa hrefhttpwishestono.deviantart.comartFinalAssignmentFinalAssignment415953408 relnofollowhttpwishestono.deviantart.comartFinalAssignmentFinalAssignment415953408ap

Negative 17928 pIm trying to make my own simple command line interpreter shell and I want the prompt to repeat itself if the only user input is whitespace. Essentially, if the user presses return, I would like the prompt to repeat and wait for the next input. I am using fgets to take input, and storing it in a char commandBuffer for parsing by parse method. I originally thought to check if there were arguments in argvargc  0, but this only causes the cursor to move to a new line without printing the prompt again. If I enter nnncd at the prompt, for example, cd still functions. Another problem I would like to try and fix is that in order to send whatever is typed at the prompt to the shell, the user must press enter twice.

Is it pretty much just a matter of installing PostgreSQL on the server and then tweaking the settings.py file to use it  I doubt it, but would any of my django code need to change  I dont have any raw SQL queries  my database access is limited to djangos model API.pli lipFrom a performance perspective, is PostgreSQL simply better in every way over SQLite Or does SQLite have certain advantages over PostgreSQL pli lipPerformance aside, does using PostgreSQL offer other deployment benefits over SQLitepli ul  pEssentially Im thinking that SQLite is good enough for my little site.  Whats the odds of it becoming really popular  Probably not that great.  SQLite is working for me now and would require no changes from my end.  However, Im concerned that maybe using PostgreSQL from the beginning would be easy and that Ill kick myself a year from now for not making the transition.  Im torn though  if I go to PostgreSQL, perhaps it will be unnecessary hassle on my part with no benefit.p  pDoes anyone have general guidelines for deciding between SQLite and something elsep  pThanksp

Negative 17928 pIm trying to use Pythons sub function and Im having a problem getting it to work.

Below is what is printed to the error log when I run this code.p  precodeIt was found string is a unicode object gktha It was NOT found string is a unicode object gktha codepre  pSo Im thinking it must be something with string that is passed into my function.  When I declared is as a unicode string or a string literal and then decode it the pattern is found.  But the pattern is not being found in the string being passed in.  I was thinking my codestring  string.decodeutf8code statement would convert any string passed into the function and then would would work.p  pI tried to do this in the python interpreter to work through this and when I declare string as a unicode string it works.p  precodestring  ugktha codepre  pSo to simulate the function I declared the string and then decode it to and then tried my regex statement and it worked.p  precodestring  gktha newString  string.decodeutf8 string  re.subur, ur, newString print string gktha codepre  pThis web app that works with a lot of unicode characters.

Negative 17928 pI have created a small C application to read some data from an event log and then display some results.  p  pThe program does a basic SQL query to get its initial datathis can take some time if querying several days worth of data, then it does some processing before it displays the results.  p  pWhat I am trying to do is when the Submit button is pressed a  message appears stating that it will take a few moments to retrieve and process the data.

The constructor should place a message with information about the Chameleon that was just created into a public instance variable.p  pThe GUI should allow the user to enter the length if it is specified the valid length is from 0.1 to 10.2 inches, the name must not be empty and the color if it is specified it must be one of green, orange, brown, black, yellow, or red.p  pWhen the user presses an OK button a Chameleon object is created using only the arguments for which the user has specified a value. After that the public instance variable containing the message must be displayed in a label from the OK buttons click procedure.p  pI have very little experience with GUI applications and I am completely lost here. Any help at all to at least get me started would be much appreciated. Like for starters, how would you overload the constructor and allow it so that three different object can be created 1. with the length and name,  2. with the name and color, or 3. with the length, name and color specifiedp

Negative 17928 pI have two related problems I need help with.p  pProblem 1 How do I model a conditional relationship I want my data to indicate that when test CLT1s Result property  High, CLT1 has relationship to Disease A. If I take a nodecentric approach, I imagine that the code might look something like...        p  precodeCLT 1 Result High  [INDICATES] gt Disease A codepre  pFurther, when CLT1s Result property  Low, CLT1 has a relationship to Disease Bp  precodeCLT 1 Result Low  [INDICATES] gt  Disease B codepre  pAlternatively, if I take a relationshipcentric approach, the code might look like this...p  precodeCLT 1 [INDICATES Result High] gt Disease A CLT 1 [INDICATES Result Low ] gt Disease B codepre  pProblem 2p  pI have had the experience that I am modeling my data, there is 1 node with a unique name, but either different labels  or properties.  The thing is that I want these nodes to be distinguishable.  However, they are not as they look the same to cypher.p  pI can either give them multiple properties, labels or different names.  The diversity has to be for each different class... in labels or properties 1n labels, properties or in different names.  p  pProblem 2 relates to Problem 1 in that I cant model the conditional relationship or distinguish the same node CLT1 by its labels or properties.  I may have to resolve it by making the queryable condition in the relationship. p  pDO I have this right  Do I have any other optionsp

Negative 17928 pI am making an android application with multilingual support. But instead of defining different string folders in my resources ie. stringsen, I have to acquire the translations via a HTTP GET request from the server. I only make this request on the initial run of the application and of course later when updating is necessarybut naturally we do not expect updates to be happening all that often, in meanings of translations. p  pThe server responds with a string that contains a JSON Object. I then proceed to parse that string and acquire the necessary translations ie. nodata No data..p  pSo my question is as follows what is the most efficient way for me to handle these translations When Im building my views, I have to acquire translations for different part of the UI. Is parsing that JSON at that moment usually in onCreate since I have a lot of fragments even an efficient way to do it What if I would store each translation entry as an entry to SharedPreferences ie. putStringnodata, No data. Would that take up too much storage space Also Im working with 2.3.3 so using a Set is not an option, since its API level 11.p  pAny advice would be most appreciatedp

Negative 17928 pI have a quite intriguing issue with my program compiled with gcc 4.6.4 on ubuntu 12.04. When I dynamically build the executable, the program runs flawlessly. But when I build it statically with static flag, it gives me a core dumped after exiting e.g. after return 0 in main. Unfortunately, the whole program is too big to pose in here.

Negative 17928 pThe precedence of Fs member selection dot . operator as used in  p  precodeSystem.Console.WriteLinetest codepre  phas a lower precedence than [space] such that the followingp  precodeignore System.Console.WriteLinetest codepre  pmust be written explicitly asp  precodeignore System.Console.WriteLinetest codepre  pthough this would be the intuition from the notion of juxtaposed symbols. Having used CoffeeScript, I can appreciate how intuitive precedence can serve to declutter code. p  pAre there any efforts being made to rationalize this kerfuffle, perhaps something along the lines that incorporated the lightweight syntax of the early yearsp  pp  pUpon review, the culprit is not the . operator but the invocation operator , as in f.

Negative 17928 pIm currently using gcc 4.1.2 and I have a use case where I want to use the linker options to wrap the exit method.

Negative 17928 pIm using strongui.bootstrap.modalstrong with a templateUrl.  Within my template HTML, I have a div element that serves as a container for a thirdparty component SlickGrid. When initializing my thirdparty component, I specify its containing element using a jQuery selector expression.  However, the selector cant seem to emfindem my container element when executed from either within the modals controller or within my opened promise logic as resolved by modal. I believe the problem is that my dialog HTML hasnt yet been added to the DOM and thus isnt visible to the controller or opened promise.  I should add that the dialog itself renders just fine its just that I cant reference its container element from ... any context  Perhaps modal doesnt support this usecase Any thoughtssuggestions would be appreciatedp  pThanks, Garryp

Negative 17928 pHappy Friday folks,p  pIm trying to write an SSRS report displaying data from three actually about 12, but only three relevant tables that have akward relationships and the SQL query behind the data is proving difficult.p  pThere are three entities involved  a Purchase Order, a Sales Order, and a Delivery. The problem is the a Purchase Order can have many sales orders, and also many deliveries which are NOT linked to the sales orders...that would be too easy.p  pBoth the Sales Order and Delivery tables can be linked to the Purchase Order table by foreign keys and an intermediate table each.p  pI need to basically list Purchase Orders, a list of sales orders and a list of deliveries next to them, with NULLs for any fields that arent valid so thatll give the required output in SSRSwhen read by a human, ie, for a purchase order with 2 sales orders and 4 delivery datesp  precodePO    SO      Delivery 1234  ABC     0510 1234  DEF     0910 1234  NULL    1012 1234  NULL    1412 codepre  pThe above when grouped by PO will tell the users there are two sales orders and four unlinked delivery dates.p  pLikewise if there are more SOs than deliveries, we need NULLs in the Delivery columnp  precodePO    SO      Delivery 1234  ABC     0308 1234  DEF     NULL 1234  GHI     NULL 1234  JKL     NULL   codepre  pAbove would be the case with 4 SOs and one delivery date.p  pUsing Left Outer joins alone gives too much duplication  in this case 8 rows, as it gives 4 delivery dates for each match on the sales orderp  precodePO    SO      Delivery 1234  ABC     0510 1234  ABC     0910 1234  ABC     1012 1234  ABC     1412     1234  DEF     0510 1234  DEF     0910 1234  DEF     1012 1234  DEF     1412 codepre  pIts fine that the PO column is duplicated as SSRS can visually group that  but the SODelivery fields cant be allowed to duplicate as this cant be got rid of in the report  if I group the column in SSRS by SO then it still spits out 4 delivery dates for each one.p  pThe only situation our query works nice is when there is just one SO per PO. In that case the single PO and SO numbers are duplicated together for x deliveries and can both be neatly grouped in SSRS. Unfortunately this is a rare occurence in the data.p  pIve thought of trying to use some sort of windowing function or CROSS APPLY but both fall down as they will repeat for every PO number listed and end up spitting out too much data.p  pAt the point of thinking this just isnt setbased enough to be doable in SQL, I know the data is horrible..p  pAny help much appreciated. p  pEDIT  basical sqlfiddle link to the table schemas.

This solution was resolved via codegit checkout stash0  ltfilenamegtcode, but the question remains as to why a stash apply did not include these files.p

Negative 17928 pI have postfix and dovecot running on a server.  When a certain kind of email comes in for accounts on the domain, Id like an SMS to go out.  I already set this up for one user using Postfixs BCC mapping and the SMS email addresses provided by the tel co.  p  pHowever, here in the postSnowden world, with heightened awareness of how easy SMS apparently is to hack, and with potential issues with long emails being sent via SMS, strongwe want the SMS to just say you got an emailstrong or something like that.  We dont want to BCC the entire email message via the SMS system.  Thats what email is for we just want the SMS to be an alert, like the way pagers were used in the old days.  I suspect there should be a way to do this but it might take me days to learn enough about procmail or script piping and postfix gateways to figure it out.  p  pI would be surprised if I was the first person in the world to want to send an SMS alert on email eventsp  pSo the BCC is apparently not a problem.  The emailtoSMS is apparently not a problem. The problem is how to modify the body of the BCCd email, or otherwise how to send a simple SMS alert or simple email alert upon certain email events specifically, when email is received for certain recipients on the server via postfix.p  pThanksp

Negative 17928 pIm working on some code with several subprojects many of which depend on each other. For example, theres a codeutilscode project with various utilities, a codequeueingcode project with some code for managing queues of things, and then a codemainAppcode project. The codequeueingcode project depends on codeutilscode, and codemainAppcode depends on both codeutilscode and codequeueingcode. There are many more projects in addition, but hopefully you get the general idea.p  pWe use to have a standard sbt submodule setup for this with one root build file, lots of subprojects and the standard codeaggregatecode and codedependsOncode stuff. This worked, but was problematicp  ul liIt could be very slow to build and run tests for the project. Building everyting takes about 15 minutes and unit testing everything takes even longer.li liDue to the way aggregate works, unit testing codemainAppcode resulted in runs of all tests in codeutilscode and codequeuingcode even if they hadnt changed. True, you can do testquick but that stops working when you change git branches and such so you still end up running the whole test suite often.li liWhile sbt does let you build just a subproject, you have to be in the root directory and remember to qualify the build. For example, you have to remember to run codesbt utilscompilecode rather than codesbt compilecode.li ul  pSo we switched to completely separate project and separate git repos. Each project builds and then deploys an artifact to Nexus. Thus, to build and test the codemainAppcode you build just it and it pulls already compiled .jar files for the other projects from the nexus server. This makes it easier to work in just one project, but it becomes harder to make a change to, for example, utils and then use it in codemainAppcode. Specifically, you often want to do something like add a method to codeutilscode and then immediately test that method in codemainAppcode to see if it worked before pushing a new version of codeutilscode. But now, to do that, you have top  ul liAdd your code to utilsli liBump the version number in utilsli liRun sbt publishlocali liEdit the build.sbt in codemainAppcode and add codeSNAPSHOTcode to the codeutilscode dependencyli liRun codesbt updatecodeli liBuild and test codemainAppcodeli ul  pIf that all works, you then have to push codeutilscode and codemainAppcode in the right order to the continuous build server and be sure to wait for the codeutilscode build to complete before you push codemainAppcode.p  pEven worse, maintaining the versioning becomes really complicated. Suppose we start with all projects at version 1.0 and depending on version 1.0 of the other projects. Now suppose we find a bug in codeutilscode that affects codemainAppcode. So we fix codeutilscode, change its version number to 1.1, update codemainAppcode to depend on 1.1 and rebuild. Suppose the code that fixed the bug in codemainAppcode introduces a bug in codequeuecode. The problem is that if you go to codequeuecode and run its tests, theyll run against version 1.0 of codeutilscode even if you use ranges as sbt only rechecks those periodically. However, when you build codemainAppcode there will be a dependency conflict on codeutilscode which sbt will resolve. No matter how it resolves it, it will be wrong for at least one project. We can set the resolver to strict but then managing versions becomes very labor intensive across the 10 projects.p  pWhat Im really looking for is a build setup that is the best of both worlds. Specificallyp  ul liI have a root dir with subdirs for each projectli liIf codepwdcode is one of those subdirs all sbt commands refer to just that project. So, if codepwdcode is codequeuecode, then codesbt testcode compiles and tests strongonlystrong codequeuecode.li liIf theres a version of an artifact in Nexus, it is pulled from there, but if theres more recent code on the disk, the dependency is built locally and that is used instead.li ul  pOr something like that. Does anyone have any advice on how to set this up with sbtp

Negative 17928 pIm struggling with the apparent lack of flexibility in SslStream AuthenticateAsServer. I have a selfsigned rootCA, an intermediate CA, and an endentity host certificate.  I am only doing server authentication.  The client has the rootCA cert baked in, and I am trying to come up with some way to send the full chain from the server to the client, so that the client can validate the server, and I can additionally compare the thumbprints of the trust anchor rootCA with that included in the client.p  pIdeally I would like to avoid using the cert store and send the certificates explicitly.  If anyone knows how to do this, it is the immediate best solution to my problem.  p  pBut it seems that SslStream AuthenticateAsServer will not in any documented way let you explicitly specify a chain to send.  You must just send the bottom cert, and let it dig the rest out of the cert store.  This is less than ideal but it seems like the only option so I am trying it that way.  The problem now, is that with the self signed CA in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities, and the intermediate in the Intermediate Root Certification Authorities on the server only the host cert and the intermedate cert are being automagically sent to the client.  I am only getting those two certs on the client, not the rootCA cert.  Whyp  pIs there a way to AuthenticateAsServer with an cert chainp  pIf not, is it a thing that it will cut the root cert off the top of the chain before sendingp  pIf there are no answers to the above, is there at least a way to shunt the automagic that digs the rest of the chain out of the store, where I can look at the result, rather than having to go through AuthenticateAsServer, to the client CertValidationCallback  Atleast this way I would be debugging a single black box, rather than a string of several black boxes.p

Negative 17928 pI am currently trying to develop a game for android. To accomplish this I am using Android Studio and using the SurfaceView control for drawing my images. The problem is that the surface view only switches between two frames. I am developing for API level 15 and using an emulator.p  pExample The XPosition of my sprite is increased with 50px by framep  pFrame 1 Drawing sprite at 100,100, XPosition100p  pFrame 2 Drawing sprite at 150,100, XPosition150p  pFrame 3 Drawing sprite at 200,100, XPosition200p  pFrame 4 Drawing sprite at 150,100, XPosition250p  pFrame 5 Drawing sprite at 200,100, XPosition300p  pand then it continues in the same way for the rest of the timeFrame 2, Frame 3, Frame 2... etc, while the xcoordinate is increased correctly.p  pThe weird thing is that the first few frames the game functions correctly, but then this loop starts. I do know that the XPosition value is incremented correctlylooked this up from the debugger.p  pI got the problem fixed by restarting the emulator, but Id like to know if this problem can happen again for a real user of the app. BTW I am coming from Visual Studio and Windows Phone and thus I am not too experienced in android.p  pMy GameThread Class Note The SpriteBatch extends SurfaceView and implements SurfaceHolder.Callbackp  precodepublic class GameThread extends Thread  private boolean running  false private SpriteBatch canvas  null private SurfaceHolder surfaceHolder  null  public GameThreadSpriteBatch sp      super     this.canvas  sp     this.surfaceHolder  sp.getHolder   public void startThread      running  true     super.start   public void stopThread      running  false   public void run      Canvas c  null     while running              c  null         try                      c  surfaceHolder.lockCanvas             synchronized surfaceHolder                              if c  null                                      canvas.onDrawc                                            sleep16                  catchInterruptedException ie                           finally                      if c  null                              surfaceHolder.unlockCanvasAndPostc                             codepre  pp  pSpriteBatch.onDrawp  precodepublic void onDrawCanvas canvas      StartTimeSystem.nanoTime     canvas.drawColorColor.WHITE      Created under initialization     Paint PaintCommandnew Paint     PaintCommand.setAlpha100     MyMatrixnew Matrix     MyMatrix.postScale0.5f,0.5f     MyMatrix.postTranslate50,50      canvas.drawBitmapMyTexture, MyMatrix, PaintCommand      EndTimeSystem.nanoTime      Game1.ElapsedfloatEndTimeStartTime1000000000f  codepre

Negative 17928 pIve built my app as a workspace containing one project with an app binary target and many projects containing static library targets. My app target links against all the static libraries. Some of my static libraries depend on each other, and I handle this by ordering the targets built in my scheme so that all dependencies are built before the libraries that depend on them.p  pWhat Id like to accomplish is to use the Parallelize Build feature to speed up building my app scheme. However I need to ensure that my static libraries are built with respect to their dependencies. It doesnt seem like I can set Target Dependencies between these static library targets because they are not all in the same project Is this the case or am I misunderstanding how this works Is it possible to have cross project target dependenciesp  pIs there any way to accomplish this Thanks for any informationp

In my actual application, I have to try them iteratively, but Id be interested in other possibilities.p  pMy instinct was to use a static initializer per subclass per xxxFudge that adds itself to a list by calling a registerFudge method of GenericFudge, but this hits the chickenandegg problem the class is never used, so its static initializer never gets invoked.p  pNo doubt theres a better way I havent envisioned.

Negative 17928 pI quite often use captha codes to secure forms. Until now I check the userentered captcha solution only on the server side for obvious reasons. For all other form fields I do a javascript validation on the client since this faster and more userfriendly. Of course I do a second check on the serverside. But for the captcha field I just checked if its filled out.p  pMy question Would it be safe to do a clientside JavaScript validation by using the hashkey e.g. MD5 of the captchacode Doing it with the hashkey wouldnt reveal the captcha code itself to bots and should be quite safe, right But maybe I am completly wrong with this idea...

Negative 17928 pI am having difficulties in wiring up a custom EditorTemplate to a grid within an MVC 5 application. I have an integer field that only accepts a 1 or 2 as a value. Rather than using a standard numeric text box or slider control, Id like to wire this up using buttons via Bootstraps group buttons. If the user clicks on the first button, the value should be set to 1, otherwise it should be set to 2.p  pThe problem that Im experiencing is that when the user clicks on the edit button, the Level value never gets applied to the editor template. The template displays as Id like, but I cannot figure out how to bind the selected value back to the Kendo grid. When the user clicks on the save button on the grid, the controller action is never invoked.p  pIf I replace the editor template with a standard Kendo control such as a numeric text box or Kendo slider, it works fine.p  pstrongViewModelstrongp  precodepublic class LotViewModel     public int LotId  get set     [DisplayName  Level]    [Range1, 2]    [UIHintLotLevel]    public int Level  get set   codepre  pstrongViewstrongp  precodeHtml.Kendo.GridltLotViewModelgt   .NamelotGrid   .Columnscolumns gt        columns.Boundx gt x.LotId.Visiblefalse     columns.Boundx gt x.Level     columns.Commandcommand gt            command.Edit     .Width100      .ToolBartoolbar gt toolbar.Create   .Editableeditable gt editable.ModeGridEditMode.InLine   .AutoBindtrue   .DataSourcedataSource gt dataSource     .Ajax     .Modelmodel gt            model.Idm gt m.LotId       model.Fieldm gt m.Level.DefaultValue1          .Readupdate gt update.ActionGetLots, Lot     .Createupdate gt update.ActionCreateLot, Lot     .Updateupdate gt update.ActionUpdateLot, Lot       codepre  pstrongEditorTemplate LotLevelstrongp  precodemodel int     var levelOne  Model.Equals1  active btnprimary  null    var levelTwo  Model.Equals2  active btnprimary  null     var htmlField  ViewData.TemplateInfo.HtmlFieldPrefix    Html.HiddenFormodel gt model ltdiv classbtngroup btngrouphtmlFieldgt   ltbutton typebutton           classbtn btndefault levelOne boolhtmlField           onclickjavascript setValuethis, 1gt     Level 1   ltbuttongt   ltbutton typebutton           classbtn btndefault levelTwo boolhtmlField           onclickjavascriptsetValuethis, 2gt     Level 2   ltbuttongt ltdivgt  ltscriptgt   function setValuebutton, level      .btngrouphtmlField button.active.removeClassactive btnprimary     button.addClassactive btnprimary     htmlField.vallevel  TODO Set the value of the model here    ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 17928 pIve created an ASP.NET 5 Class Library using the new project structure provided by Microsoft.  I can build the project and host it on a personal Nuget Feed just fine.

Given that ASP.NET 5 is still pretty new, I dont yet have any projects that would make use of its new structure yet I.e. project.json.

Negative 17928 pI have searched Stackoverflow for the answer but did not find any.p  pIn every shared hosting that I have used so far, all of them provide phpmyadmin, integrated with their control panel cPanel or Plesk. However, one can enter phpmyadmin only after logging into control panel. This is very impractical when multiple programmers are working on different modules, and working on different tables of a database, and I do not want my hosting control panel exposed to them. All I want is that they can open a phpmyadmin running on my hosting server, connect with the database using the servername, dbname, username and password and perform table level operations.p  pTo achieve that I installed phpMyAdmin in my godaddy hosting directory structure, under httpdocs. created config directory under it and copied config.sample.inc.php as config.sample.inc, made sure it has write permission and ran setup. I provided the server IP and port, and set onlydb to just one database that I created using goDaddys integrated phpMyAdmin. Saved the config, and opened mydomain.comphpmyadmin. It showed a login page. I entered username and password that I had specified while creating the MySQL database in goDaddys integrated phpMyAdmin. But my phpMyAdmin is not able to login with those credentials. I am sure about the usernamepassword because I can operate on the database by normal php script with same serverport, dbname, username, password.p  pI thought phpMyAdmin, being just a set of PHP script will be able to successfully create the connection, show all tables under a specific database, and would be able to let us operate on those tables. I did not understand whats stopping phpMyAdmin from connecting with all correct credentials, while a simple php script using mysqli can successfully connect and execute SQL commands on the given databasep  pQ1. Is there any way to get phpMyAdmin work in the mode I want Q2. Is there any other script available that can connect with a database as a client script and provide a simple web based GUI for table operationsp  pI am very close to write my own php application for this purpose, but dont want to duplicate any work that has already solved this problem.p  pMany thanks for your help.

Negative 17928 pI am getting started with Spring Cloud using Eureka and Zuul and had some questions around structuring bluegreen and Canary deployments. So far, I have the basics worked out and have Eureka, Zuul, and a config server working as expected. What I am trying to accomplish is set up a service that has two versions, say 1.0 and a 1.1. For a subset of specific users, I want to route them to the 1.1 version and everyone else should go to the 1.0 version. p  pThe Zuul filter API is a little light on documentation and Im struggling a bit to grok some of the concepts, so I thought Id ask a few questions here. I have also have some basic filters running, which dont do a whole lot a the moment other than getting the identity of the principal and the service they are requesting. Where I am hitting a wall is understanding how to expose two different versions of the same service to Eureka and Zuul. A few things Im curious aboutp  ul liBetween documentation, posts, and other stack overflow, the term service and cluster seem to be used interchangeably. Is this correctli liWith that said if I have a service named codesimpleservicecode do I expose two different serviceIDs i.e. codesimpleservicecode and codesimpleservice1.1code  And If I do that, when one of the targeted users requests codesimpleservicecode, Im having Zuul send them to codesimpleservice1.1codeli liOr, do you add another node to the existing service ID and add additional metadata to each node so that Zuul and distinguish versions 1.0 and 1.1li liIs the correct answer all of the above li ul

Negative 17928 pI have a very large data set now. The response variable is binary 10. The bad population size is a very small portion of the entire data set. The good population size is 8,000,000. The bad population size that is tagged as 1 is only 7,000. p  pI used a decision tree, this decision tree would take the features as the inputs, and then would classify the individuals into either 1 or 0.p  pBecause the population size was really large. R was not able to efficiently process all data. So I decided to randomly sample some good samples. But I wanted to keep all the bad samples. So I selected 8000 good samples and included all the 7000 bad samples. Thus, I had a 15,000 samples. I randomly splited them into training and testing data set. After training the decision tree on the training set, I fitted the testing data into the trained model, the result was vary promising. p  pHowever, I am really worried how this model would work on the entire population now. Although I compared the distribution conditioned on different variables for the good samples and good populations, the distribution of the good samples wasvery consistent with the good population. p  pBecause the good samples and bad samples are equally weighted in the sampled data, the effect of the BAD is exaggerated in training the model, I am thinking that BAD will not be BAD if the entire data fit into the model, because the bad part is too tiny. do you think this is a potential failing issue for the model Do you have any suggestions to fix this problemp
