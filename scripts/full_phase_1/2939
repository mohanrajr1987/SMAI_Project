Positive 2939 pI am wondering two things... Does it make any sense to resize an unordered containers in a manner similar to codeshrinktofitcode once the container has been filled and you know there wont be any new items added to it Probably this is not something you normally want to do, as the buckets are only about pointer size I guess. So... There would not be a lot of space to be won in resizing in most cases anyway.. or would therep  pSecondly... what would that function  There is coderehashltbucketcountgtcode. But is there also a function similar to codeshrinktofitcode for unordered containers that remove all empty buckets and rehashes the container accordingly p

Positive 2939 pIm developing a mobile app where users can take photos with the devices camera and upload.

Positive 2939 pIn my JavaFX application I need to update it to handle window resizing. What I want to do is for when the window gets bigger keep everything aligned the same and just have the TextArea grow to be proportionate with the window and similar when making it smaller.p  pI will set a min and max height to fit the buttons on the righthand side decreasing the spacing a little as it gets smaller.p  pIm figuring out that an AnchorPane is not the best option for this and I was hoping I could get a little guidance on a better approach. The text area I am using is custom, extending StyledTextArea RichTextFX API.p  pLast spec is I want the text field and button under the text to be aligned with the text area and I think the Pane to make distance between the TextField and button will be a cumbersome approach I was planning on not making it resizable.p  pImage for reference  a hrefhttps22.postimg.orgfgopi6781textapp.png relnofollowtext app imageap  pAny help would be really appreciated.

Negative 2939 pI want to learn how others cope with the following scenario.p  pThis is not homework or an assignment of any kind. The example classes have been created to better illustrate my question however it does reflect a real life scenario which we would like feedback on.p  pWe retrieve all data from the database and place it into an object. A object represents a single record and if multiple records exist in the database, we place the data into a Listlt of the record object.p  pLets say we have the following classesp  precode    public class Employee              public bool Modified         public string FirstName         public string LastName         public ListltEmplyeeAddressgt Address           public class EmployeeAddress              public bool Modified         public string Address         public string City         public string State      codepre  pPlease note that the Getters and Setters have been omitted from the classes for the sake of clarity. Before any code police accuse me of not using them, please note that have been left out for this example only.p  pThe database has a table for Employees and another for Employee Addresses.p  pConceptually, what we do is to create a List object that represents the data in the database tables. We do a deep clone of this object which we then bind to controls on the front end. We then have two objects Orig and Final representing data from the database.p  pThe user then makes changes to the Final object by creating, modifying, deleting records. We then want to persist these changes to the database.p  pObviously we want to be as elegant as possible, only editing, creating, deleting those records that require it. p  pWe ultimately want to compare the two List objects so that we can p  ol lipSee what properties have changed so that the changes can be persisted to the database.  pli lipSee what properties records no longer exist in the second Listlt so that these records can be deleted from the database.  pli lipSee what new properties exist in the new Listlt so that we can create these in the database.pli ol  pWho wants to get the ball rolling on how we can best achieve this. Keep in mind that we also need to drill down into the EmployeeAddress list to check for any changes, not just the top level properties.p  pI hope I have made myself clear and look forward to any suggestions.p

Negative 2939 pI am trying to write a program to check that some C source code conforms to a variable naming convention.  In order to do this, I need to analyse the source code and identify the type of all the local and global variables.p  pThe end result will almost certainly be a python program, but the tool to analyse the code could either be a python module or an application that produces an easytoparse report.  Alternatively more on this below it could be a way of extracting information from the compiler by way of a report or similar.  In case thats helpful, in all likelihood, it will be the a hrefhttpwww.keil.comKeila ARM compiler.p  pIve been experimenting with a hrefhttpctags.sourceforge.netctagsa and this is very useful for finding all of the typedefs and macro definitions etc, but it doesnt provide a direct way to find the type of variables, especially when the definition is spread over multiple lines which I hope it wont be.p  pExamples might includep  precodestatic volatile u8 var1  should be flagged as static and volatile and a u8 typedef of unsigned 8bit integer volatile    comments         static  inserted just to make life          u8  difficult    var2          u8 72              likewise nasty syntax, but technically valid C const uint16t pointer1   flagged as a pointer to a constant uint16t int  const pointer2  flagged as a constant pointer to an int const char  const pointer3  flagged as a constant pointer to a constant char static MyTypedefTYPE var3  flagged as a MyTypedefTYPE variable u8 var4, var5, var6  72 int array1[SOMELENGTH]  flagged as an array of pointers to integers char array2[FIRSTDIM][72]  flagged as an array of arrays of type char codepre  petc etc etcp  pIt will also need to identify whether theyre local or globalfilescope variables which ctags can do and if theyre local, Id ideally like the name of the function that theyre declared within.p  pAlso, Id like to do a similar thing with functions identify the return type, whether theyre static and the type and name of all of their arguments.p  pUnfortunately, this is rather difficult with the C syntax since there is a certain amount of flexibility in parameter order and lots of flexibility in the amount of white space that is allowed between the parameters.  Ive toyed with using some fancy regular expressions to do the work, but its far from ideal as there are so many different situations that can be applied, so the regular expressions quickly become unmanageable.  I cant help but think that compilers must be able to do this in order to work, so I was wondering whether it was possible to extract this information.

Negative 2939 p[Edit]p  pMy originalquestion was Why to decide between static and nonstatic Both do the same...p  pUnfortunately it was edited to a Cspecific question what I really wanted to avoid.p  pSo, let me do some additionsp  pWhen I say interface, I dont mean the Ckeywordinterface but what I understand something like a Cinterface A set of well defined functions to operate with my object. When saying weaken my interface, I mean I have different functions staticnonstatic that do the same thing. My interface is not well defined anymore when there are different functions to do the same thing.p  pSo, as Bob the Janitor posted, I can implement a Validatefunctionp  precodeDocument.ValidatemyDocumentObject codepre  pbut alsop  precodemyConcreteDocumentObject.Validate codepre  pTo get back to my Copyexample one could implement Copy likep  precodemyConcreteDocument.CopytoPath codepre  pbut alsop  precodeDocument.CopymyConcreteDocumentObject, toPath codepre  porp  precodeDocument.CopyfromPath, toPath codepre  pwhen I think of a folder that contains all the files belonging to my Document in this case Im not dependent of a concrete instance  but Im dependent from other things .p  pIn general Im talking about static methods not static classes sorry, if I forgot to mension.p  pBut as Anton Gogolev said I think my Document class is not a good example and not well designed so I think I will have to have a look at the Single Responsibility Principle.p  pI could also implement some kind of ManagerClass that operates with my DocumentClassp  pFor examplep  precodemyDocumentManagerObject.CopymyConcreteDocumentObject, toPath codepre  porp  precodemyDocumentManagerObject.CopymyConcreteDocumentObject, toPath codepre  pbut if I refer to approach 1 I would tend to create objects that perform their tasks by themself rather than other objects DocumentManager that do something emwithem my DocumentObject.p  pI hope this will not take the direction of a religious discussion about OOP .p  p[EDIT]p  phr p  h2Old Versionh2  pAt first this seems to be a very basic question like when to use static methods and when not but this is something Im confronted every now and then and I have difficulties to describe what the real problem is perhaps its just to get reasons why not to use 1 or why not to use 2.p  pAlthough Im using CSyntax this is not a Crestricted problemp  pIn OOP there are two approaches amongst others of working with objectsp  p1 If I want my object to do something, I just tell him to do sop  precodemyConcreteObject.DoSomething codepre  pIts just like talking to an object.p  p2 Or if youre a fan of static methodsp  precodeObjectClass.JustDoIt codepre  pIn some way I think static functions just feel better. So I tend to use static methods very often to be independent from a concrete instance  independency is always good thing.p  pSo, when designing a class I often have to decide if I take approach 1 or approach 2p  pImagine you have a class Document which should stand for a document that should be saved into a databasep  pA Documentp  ul liconsists of one or more image files from filesystem these become the single document pagesli lihas something like a bibliography  fields the user can add information about the document to  which is saved to an extra fileli liand should have some operations like Copy, AddPage, RemovePage etc.li ul  pNow Im confrontated with several ways to create this classp  precode 1 non static approachtalking to objects  Document newDocument  new Document   Copy document to x another database, for example newDocument.CopytoPath codepre  pI like this I tell the document to copy itself to database x and the object does so by itself. Nice.p  precode 2 static approach  Document.CopymyDocumentObject, toPath codepre  pWhy not Also nice, feels very handy...p  pSo, which one to implement Both Or putting the static approach to a kind of helper class Or choose approach 1 and stick with it to not weaken the interface of my Documentclassp  pWhen thinking about both approaches I come to the conclusion that in theory one could implement any function as a static functionp  precodeClass.FunctionaConcreteClassObject, parameters codepre  pbut also nonstaticp  precodeaConcreteObject.DoSomethingparameters codepre  pTo give a realworld examplep  p[EDITAdded parameter fromPath Sorry, I forgot]p  precode 2 static approach  File.CopyfromPath, toPath     .NetFrameworklike codepre  p[EDIT]p  pbut alsop  precode 1 non static approach  ExampeFileClass fileObject  new ExampleFileClass fileObject.CopytoPath codepre  por even kind of OOPOverkillp  precode 1 non static approach, too  fileObject.ToPath  CTestfile.txt      property of fileObject fileObject.Copy                            copy to toPath codepre  pSo, why not to use 1 or why not to use 2p  pI would not concentrate on the Document class example too much, since its more a general question about good class design.p
Negative 2939 pLets say you want to diagram a codeMapcode class the mathematical kind, not the cartographic kind.  In Ruby, you might have something likep  precodeclass Map   attraccessor nodes, edges   def initialize     nodes  Set.new     edges  Set.new   end   def minimumspanningtreeampmstalgorithm     mstalgorithm.callnodes, edges   end   ... end codepre  pWhen I start diagramming this, my thinking goes as followsp  pLets try a Class diagram since were talking about classes.  Ill create a codeMapcode class.  And a codeNodecode class.  And an codeEdgecode class.  And a codeSetcode class.  Fine.  Now Ill draw a ComposedOf12 line from codeMapcode to codeSetcode  one for each codenodescode and codeedgescode.  Then a hasmany10.. line from codeSetcode to codeNodecode and another one from codeSetcode to codeEdgecode.  But now Im saying that each set can have any mix of codeNodecodes and codeEdgecodes, which isnt true.  And it doesnt help to put down two codeSetcode elements on the diagram with two corresponding ComposedOf11 lines, since theyre the same object.p  pSo I thought well, maybe UML wants me to be more CJavaey.  A templated codeSetltNodegtcode and codeSetltEdgegtcode arent possible in UML, but I could create subclasses codeNodeSetcode and codeEdgeSetcode.p  pLastly I considered an Object diagram, but thats not right.  Im talking about the codeSetcode class, not individual codeSetcode instances.p  pIs there a better answer Or have I already found the least bad onep  pstrongLaterstrongp  pThe answers that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions878863wheresthemiddlegroundbetweenclassandobjectinuml878895878895Marc Wa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions878863wheresthemiddlegroundbetweenclassandobjectinuml879034879034Pete Kirkhama are fantastic for the question as I first worded it.  The problem is that I was trying do use a simple analogy to my real problem because I cant reveal the problem as it exists.  I was really only after the bit about how to have two of the same class that have different relationships, but act the same and have the same attributes though not attribute values.p  pLets try again with some different models an codeActiveDirectorycode, a codeFirewallcode, and two codeRoutercodes.  One router the LAN one has references to the codeActiveDirectorycode and the codeFirewallcode the other the WAN one has references to the codeFirewallcode and some number of public servers well ignore them in this diagram.  Its perfectly conceivable that both codeRoutercodes are of the same make, model, ampc. Theyll have different serial numbers the objects are different, but theyre definitely both codeRoutercodes.  Yet to put both on a class diagram, I have to subclass codeRoutercode into codeLANRoutercode and codeWANRoutercode.  The analogy to Marc Ws solution is to connect the codeFirewallcode and codeActiveDirectorycode directly, leaving the implementation codeRoutercode to the class to determine.  But the abstraction must leak if the UML is to be used to actually build the system.p

I envision passing in a list of property names and associated DataType into the Dialog that I can use to populate a ComboBox. So the user will choose which property they want to query from the comboBox and based on the selection the appropriate comparers and UI control will be made available for the user to enter in thier criteria.  Lastly, it will contain an ANDOR togglebutton at the end which the user can use to add additional criterion. Each criterion will be an object of type codeFilterItemcode as shown belowp  precodepublic class FilterItem      public string MappedPropertyName  get set      public enumComparer Comparer  get set      public object FilterValue  get set      public enumOpertor Operator  get set   codepre  pbr After the user constructs hisher query, I intend to pass this as a codeListltFilterItemgtcode back to my calling form, which can then iterate thru the list and allow me to filter the original codeListltTaskgtcode.  p  pThis is all fine, and something that I can put together with ease.  But I want to make sure that the ACTUAL filter mechanism I go with is as stronglytyped as possible, and not using bulit up strings like in the Dynamic Query Library.

Negative 2939 pFrom what Ive read, code obfuscation isnt really that hard to crack, and it will only delay the inevitable.  In that case, what is its purpose  p  pIf someone really wants to steal your source they can.p  pIf someone needs to view your source code for harmlesshelpful purposes they cant.p  pYou probably shouldnt be storing anything sensitive in the code, so that shouldnt be an issue.p  pIf you dont obfuscate, youre still not providing the full source code, so you could sell a source code license.p  pThe funny thing is, the only code that I have ever seen obfuscated is terrible code that has bugs in it.  The only reason I need to look at the code is to figure out what the problem is and what I can do to fix it.p  pFor example, I need to replace some of the images in ASPDotNetStoreFront.  When looking for the location of the  tags, I found that they were contained within compiled code.  CRAP.  So I figured I would decompile the code, to find out which img tags to replace via Regex.  I tried to view the source code to see what images could possibly come from the given compiled method, and reflector cant handle it, I presume because of obfuscation.  I dont really have time to go looking around for decomilersdeobfuscators.p

Negative 2939 pI consider a selfdescribed  autodescriptive service as a good thing in a SOA architecture, since almost everything you know to call the service is present in the service contract such a WSDL.p  pSample of a non selfdescribed service for me is Facebook Query Language FQL a hrefhttpwiki.developers.facebook.comindex.phpFQL relnofollowhttpwiki.developers.facebook.comindex.phpFQLa, or any web service exchanging XML flow in a one String parameter for then parsing XML and performing treatments.p  pLast ones seem further more technically decoupled, since technically you can switch implementations without technical impact on the caller, handling compatibility between implementationsversions at a business level.

Negative 2939 pIn both my Java classes, and the books we used in them laying out a GUI with code heavily involved the constructor of the JFrame.

Negative 2939 pDoes anyone have suggestions for a java mock File object I Am using a thirdparty class which need to get a java.io.File object as argument. I receive the data for this file in a stream over a webservice also one of their products.p  pOne solution is to write all this data to a file and offer this to the class. This is a solution I dont like it takes away the advantage of using the webservice in stead of just downloading the file.p  pQuicker and more efficient would be to put this data from memory in a Mock File and offer this Mock File to the thirdparty class.p  pIt would probably have to be a MockFile extending the java.io.File and overriding all the functions that do actual interfacing with the file on the hard disk.p  pI know the thirdparty should have used a stream as an input argument in stead of a file.

Negative 2939 pFirst, heres a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3605115howshouldiarchitectmydbapiserverforaturnbasedmultiplayeriphoneboamy original question that spawned all of thisa.p  pIm using Appcelerator Titanium to develop an iPhone app eventually Android too. Im connecting to CouchDBs port directly by using Titaniums a hrefhttpdeveloper.appcelerator.comapidocmobilelatestTitanium.Network.TCPSocketobject.htmlTitanium.Network.TCPSocket objecta. I embelieveem it utilizes the Apple SDKs CFSocketNSStream class.p  pOnce connected, I simply writep  pcodeGET mydbchangesfilterappmyfilterampfeedcontinuousampgameid4ampheartbeat30000 HTTP1.1rnrncode p  pdirectly to the socket. It keeps it open forever and returns JSON data whenever the db is updated and matches the filter and change request. Cool.p  pIm wondering, is it ok to connect directly to CouchDBs socket like this, or would I be better off opening the socket to node.js instead, and maybe using this a hrefhttpgithub.comfelixgenodecouchdbCouchDB node.js modulea to handle the CouchDB proxy through node.jsp  pMy main concern is performance. I just dont have enough experience with CouchDB to know if hitting its socket and passing faux HTTP requests directly is good practice or not. Looking for experience and opinions on any ramifications or alternate suggestions.p

Negative 2939 pIm using SQLite3 in a Windows application. I have the source code socalled SQLite amalgamation.p  pSometimes I have to execute heavy queries. That is, I call codesqlite3stepcode on a prepared statement, and it takes a lot of time to complete due to the heavy IO load.p  pI wonder if theres a possibility to abort such a call. I would also be glad if there was an ability to do some background processing in the middle of the call strongwithin the same threadstrong since most of the time is spent in waiting for the IO to complete.p  pI thought about modifying the SQLite code myself. In the simplest scenario I could check some condition like an abort event handle for instance before every invocation of either codeReadFilecodecodeWriteFilecode, and return an error code appropriately. And in order to allow the background processing the file should be opened in the overlapped mode this enables asynchronous codeReadFilecodecodeWriteFilecode.p  pIs there a chance that interruption of codeWriteFilecode may in some circumstances leave the database in the inconsistent state, even with the journal enabled I guess not, since the whole idea of the journal file is to be prepared for any error of any kind. But Id like to hear more opinions about this.p  pAlso, did someone tried something similarp  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThanks to ereOn. I wasnt aware of the existence of codesqlite3interruptcode. This probably answers my question.p  pNow, for all of you who wonders how and why one expects to do some background processing during the IO within the same thread.p  pUnfortunately not many people are familiar with socalled Overlapped IO.p  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOverlappedIO relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOverlappedIOap  pUsing it one issues an IO operation strongasynchronouslystrong, and the calling thread is strongnot blockedstrong. Then one receives the IO completion status using one of the completion mechanisms waitable event, new routine queued into the APC, or the completion port.p  pUsing this technique one doesnt have to create extra threads. Actually the only strongrealstrong legitimation for creating threads is when your bottleneck is the computation time i.e. CPU load, and the machine has several CPUs or cores.p  pAnd creating a thread just to let it be blocked by the OS most of the time  this doesnt make sense. This leads to the unjustified waste of the OS resources, complicates the program need for synchronization and etc..p  pUnfortunately not all the librariesAPIs allow asynchronous mode of operation, thus making creating extra threads the necessarily evil.p  pstrongEDIT2strongp  pIve already found the solution, thansk to ereOn.p  pFor all those who nevertheless insist that its not worth doing things in background while waiting for the IO to complete using overlapped IO. I disagree, and I think theres no point to argue about this. At least this is not related to the subject.p  pIm a Windows programmer as you may noticed, and I have a very extensive experience in all kinds of multitasking. Plus Im also a driver writer, so that I also know how things work behind the scenes.p  pI know that its a common practice to create several threads to do several things in parallel. But this doesnt mean that this is a good practice. Please allow me not to follow the common practice.p

Negative 2939 pSo, Ive successfully figured out how to do a simple diff and a 3 way merge with commandline subversion and Beyond Compare 3 using Windows 7. Thank you, stackoverflow.p  pHowever, I frequently have lots of files that I change in between commits, i.e. an html file, css file and javascript file all related to the same bug fix. When Im using the built in svn diff, I can just type svn di and it will show me a list of all the diffs in all the files. Is there a way to trigger this type of functionality with Beyond Compare 3p  pAt the moment, when I type svn di, it will send the first file to Beyond Compare, and when Im done reviewing the changes, I close the beyond compare window, and the diff ends. Theres no way for me to diff the other files without typing in each name manually. And sometimes I cant remember all the ones Ive changed... basically, it gets really messy.p  pIs this even possible If so, howp  pThanks.p

Negative 2939 pI am working on a project which is similar to an address book. Firstly we have a number of students in a text file. I am going to implement a multi linked list which this list have 2 headtail pointer headtail pointer for name,surname. These pointers show the same list but different locations because I am adding the nodes in ascending order and use double pointers to print the list backwards. The problem is I implemented the list by adding nodes by name and surname and the operation goes successfully when I insert another one. But I realized that when I deleted a node by herhis name and print the list again the student doesnt exist, but when I print the list by surname the student does exist. Then I recognize that I was implemented two separate linked lists. I was told to implement only ONE add and remove function. But how can I add a node by its first name pointers and surname pointers together I hope I explained my issue understandably. Here are my blocks of code.p  pMy structuresp  precodetypedef struct node      int birthdate     int zipcode     int phonenum     char firstname[50]     char lastname[50]     char city[50]     char

But if I invoke the shuffle function on my Vector. to be drawn onto the screen some of the MovieClips are not displaying after I add them to the display list which Ive tested and know is happening. Some randomly appear and some dont. Which ones display and which ones dont appears to be random each time I run my application maybe it has something to do with my codeinitMovieClipscode function, which uses pseudorandom code. p  pIve tried implementing the shuffle function at different points in my code, in places where the Bitmaps have already been drawn, and in places where I havent even invoke the function to start loading the Bitmaps so I dont think its a threading issue. I even tried inserting code to draw a simple test circle on every MovieClips graphics property. Just to see if it was a problem with the Bitmaps, but the ones that werent being drawn showed no Bitmap or test circle. This leads me to believe that its a problem with the graphics property itself. Which leaves me completely stumped. Any ideas on what it could bep

Negative 2939 pI am new to Lucene and my project is to provide specialized search for a set of booklets. I am using Lucene Java 3.1.p  pThe basic idea is to help people know where to look for information in the rather large and dry booklets by consulting the index to find out what booklet and page numbers match their query. Each Document in my index represents a particular page in one of the booklets.p  pSo far I have been able to successfully scrape the raw text from the booklets, insert it into an index, and query it just fine using StandardAnalyzer on both ends.p  pSo heres my general questionbr Many queries on the index will involve searching for place names mentioned in the booklets. Some place names use notational variants. For instance, in the body text it will be called Ship Creek on one page, but in a map diagram elsewhere it might be listed as Ship Cr. or even Ship Ck.. What I need to know is how to approach treating the two consecutive words as a single term and add the notational variants as synonyms.p  pMy goal is of course to search with any of the variants and catch all occurrences. If I search for Ship AND Cr Ck Creek this does not give me what I want because other words may appear between [ship] and [cr][ck][creek] leading to false positives.p  pSo, in a nutshell I probably still need the basic stuff provided by StandardAnalyzer, but with specific term grouping to emit place names as complete terms and possibly insert synonyms to cover the variants.p  pFor instance, the text ...allowed from the mouth of Ship Creek upstream to ... would result in tokens [allowed],[mouth],[ship creek],[upstream]. Perhaps via a TokenFilter along the way, the [ship creek] term would expand into [ship creek][ship ck][ship cr].p  pAs a bonus it would be nice to treat the trickier text ..except in Ship, Bird, and Campbell creeks where the limit is... as [except],[ship creek],[bird creek], [campbell creek],[where],[limit].p  pThis seems like a pretty basic use case, but its not clear to me how I might be able to use existing components from Lucene contrib or SOLR to accomplish this. Should the detection and merging be done in some kind of TokenFilter Do I need a custom Analyzer implementationp  pSome of the term grouping can probably be done heuristically [em],[creek] is [em creek] but I also have an exhaustive list of places mentioned in the text if that helps.p  pThanks for any help you can provide. p

Negative 2939 pi googled the phrase lightweight ORM for j2ee and find this page a hrefhttpjavasource.netopensourcepersistence relnofollowhttpjavasource.netopensourcepersistencea from one of results. my goal is to find an ORM Framework that is lighter than Hibernate and also delivers some of hibernates features that are most important to me, for example auto table generating and lazy initializing, and dont give me hard time with tables and maps and collection. it is also important that the coming ORM has a community around it which makes it faster to find solutions to errors and bugs. and it also is important that the new orm hides the database from me needs less sql skills and be more OO. so far i have narrowed my choices to iBatis myBatis and ORMLite. i want this ORM for my new project which is a desktop application in j2ee, so it is important that the start up time for this orm be less than others unlike Hibernate which takes a lot of time for first time running specially when you have lots of tablesp  pthnxp

Negative 2939 pWe have an application that works with financial data that is schemaless. More accurately, the shemaless data is information about an order, where fields are customized by the merchant. Consistency and durability is important.p  pBecause of how dynamic our data is reporting is very difficult. Each record can vary slightly, or be completely different. If we continue to use a relational database, it appears our only option is to serialize the document as a blob. The reporting would have to be done separately, perhaps by copying data into a common structure defined by user defined reports each report would have a custom table.p  pAnother option is a documentoriented NoSQL database like MongoDB. After doing some research it appears that most people wouldnt trust a NoSQL database with financial data because it relies on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiEventualconsistency relnofollowBASEa rather than a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiACID relnofollowACIDa.p  pI seem to have found myself in the middle of two completely different use cases. My data fits extremely well into a documentoriented database MongoDB, but I need the reliability of an ACID database. At the same time complex userdefined reports are a necessity.p  pSo I seem to have three choicesp  ol liUse two MySQL databases One for storing data blob, and the other for user define reports lots of tables.li liUse MongoDB, which supports large databases, but has a global write lock and is eventually consistant.li liUse MySQL to store data blob, then copy it to MongoDB for reporting. Given that the only index would probably be merchantID, how well would this workli ol  pSo which of the three is my best option most flexibility and durability Are there other options I havent considered knowing I cant change how dynamic the data is Anyone use MongoDB for reporting in productionp  pFor our RDMS we use MySQL. Thinking of switching to MariaDB. Programming language of choice is PHP. Thinking about using Sphinx for FULL TEXT search, like searching for someones name.p

Negative 2939 pI am trying to model a scheduling application for my company and could use some suggestions.  Id like to follow a domaindriven design, if appropriate.p  pThe domain consists of a Show object which represents one trade show, exhibition or conference where we may be promoting our products. It has start and end dates and times, an agenda, list of speakers, location, etc. Quite a bit of work can be done with the Show, such as assigning speakers, registering attendees, cancelling, etc.p  pWe typically participate in a Show as part of one or more marketing Campaigns. A Campaign also has start and end dates and other information as well as a list of Shows we will be attending for that Campaign. It is possible that we will be promoting more than one Campaign at a given Show.p  pShows can be added or removed from Campaigns and when a Show is cancelled, it must be removed from any Campaigns it was associated with.p  pMy first thought was to have a Schedule aggregate root with a list of Campaign entities that contained a list of Show objects.  But I need a way to access standalone Shows  and a Show can be associated with more than one Campaign.p  pLooking at my use cases, I am developing a Silverlight client but may also go mobile. The main view will be a calendartype UI like Outlook that displays each Show as an appointment. There are also side bars that display Upcoming Shows, Current Campaigns and Shows that have followup tasks. When I doubleclick an item in any of these views, the Show details are displayed in a child window.p  pAny suggestions how to model this domain in my application codep

In each sub scrollview, I added an inputAccessoryView to the keyboard to add a Done button, and I want to call a method to save the data when this button is pressed, and then remove the keyboard the latter of which I already have done, I just need to figure out the saving part. I feel that it would be easier to have one method in my super scrollview that will save all of the data so I can just add in a few lines of code to each sub scrollview by the way, these sub scrollviews arent subclassed from the main scrollview, they are UIViewController subclasses, so I cant just use super because I have to copypaste it into 6 different files. I was able to access the super class the big scrollview that has all of the others in it by importing it in the sub scrollview and creating a new object, but I feel thats not what Im supposed to do. That leads me into my next question. If access the bigger scrollview in this way, trying to access the text property of the UITextViews returns null, whereas accessing the same property from within the class of the sub scrollview displays the text.p  pPlease let me know if Im doing something completely wrong, as I feel like having 6 different scrollviews is really inefficient but testing it on two iPod touches, a 2nd gen and a 4th gen, there isnt much lag at all so it cant be too inefficient or else itd hog memory and make it lag, rightp  pThanks, Leep  pEDIT Im still having trouble with this. The button I created was created programmatically, so I cant link it to the first responder in Interface Builder. Is there a way to do this programmatically as well Heres my code to create the inputAccessoryViewp  precodevoidcreateInputAccessoryView inputAccView  [[UIView alloc]initWithFrameCGRectMake10.0, 0.0, [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.width, 40.0] UIToolbar toolbar  [[UIToolbar alloc]initWithFrameCGRectMake0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 40.0] UIBarButtonItem doneBttn  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]initWithTitleDone styleUIBarButtonItemStyleDone targetself actionselectorendEdit] [toolbar setItems[NSArray arrayWithObjectdoneBttn]] [inputAccView addSubviewtoolbar] [toolbar release] [doneBttn release]  codepre  pThe button points to a method in the same class that will close the keyboard. However, before I close the keyboard, I need it to call another method to save the data which is in a different class. Does this help anyones understandingp

I dont need my code re written.p  pWe use Windows XP, Internet Explorer 7, and Office 2003. Something is causing random people to not be able to automate internet explorer. It is not a user issue, but a computer issue. What I mean is on the culprit computers nobody can automate no matter which user logs in. But the same user can use a different computer and everything is fine. Therefore, it is likely a registry setting on the local machine or something like that. All computers are set up the same way here, same specs, same software.p  pI have googled and googled and googled and googled. Unfortunately runtime error 70 seems to be a catch all and a lot of users report the error for different symptoms. In my case I have not found a solution otherwise I would not be asking here.p  pThe only way we can solve it is to have IT completely reload everything on the hard drive. A clean refresh including the operating system. That takes care of the problem but it also forces the user set their machine up again to the way they had it before and reinstall all of the software and everything. That is not a good solution. There is a setting somewhere on the machine causing this or the refresh would not have an effect. I want to know what that setting is my feeling is it is a registry setting.p  pAny help is appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 2939 pI am using a large open source library and need to generate personal subclasses of a few of the classes. What are the best strategies I would like to keep the original library unaltered and be easily able to reconfigure when it is updated. It is unlikely that my code is worth contributing to the project though I am happy to write in a way that permits this.p  pThe problem is a general one  but I will illustrate it with my example. I am using a hrefhttppdfbox.apache.orgApache PDFBoxa which has a routine to write to codejava.awt.Graphics2Dcode. I have replaced this by the Apache a hrefhttpxmlgraphics.apache.orgbatikBatika toolkit which provides a subclass of Graphics2D codeorg.apache.batik.svggen.SVGGraphics2Dcode so I can capture the SVG representation.

My concern is that I have had to hackedit and recompile a number of the distributed PDFBox classes simply to generate and use the subclass. I end up with classes such as PMRPDFReader in the same packages as the library. Its very messy  I cant immediately remember where I made the edits, etc.p  pI feel I ought ought to be able to use the library asis and simply addlink my subclasses. I use maven so maybe there is a way of excluding the original classes. p

Negative 2939 pIm hoping someone here can explain what incorrect assumptions Im making. In C 4.0, I have 2 interfaces and a class that implements them both. In a method I declare a variable with the type of the first interface, instantiate it using the class that implements both interfaces and can somehow cast it successfully to the second interface like in the following codep  precode    public interface IFirstInterface               void Method1           public interface ISecondInterface              void Method2           public class InterfaceImplementation  IFirstInterface, ISecondInterface              public void Method1           public void Method2             public class SomeClass              public void SomeMethod                      IFirstInterface first  new InterfaceImplementation             first.Method1               Shouldnt the next line return null             ISecondInterface second  first as ISecondInterface               second is not null and the call to Method2 works fine             second.Method2               codepre  pIm trying to understand why the casting is successful. Yes, the class implements both interfaces, but I would think that since the first variable is declared as IFirstInterface which doesnt inherit from ISecondInterface, the casting should still fail. p  pIve also tried restructuring my code in other ways, such as not using as, but the cast is still successful.p  pWhat am I missingp

Negative 2939 pIm having issues with keyboard navigation in my wpf application. Simplified I have a horizontal stackpanel with a list of menu items which takes up about a quater of the width of the screen.p  pDirectly under that I have a content control that takes the entire width of the screen.p  pThe content control will change the loaded usercontrol based on the menu item highlighted.

The first column contains focusable items but the second does not. This works fine for the first couple of menu items in the stackpanel that are directly above the first column but eventually I get to menu items that are directly over the second column and at this point I am unable to navigate down.p  pI added the outer grid as shown in the above xaml but this did not help.  Why does the focus not move to the first focusable element available in the grid or inner grid and how can I force focus into column 1p  pI guess I can do this in my viewmodel but I have a significant number of pages all suffering from similar issues so was hoping for an easier solution than having to completely rewrite and control all keyboard navigation.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pUPDATE If I set focuasable to true on the first grid the navigation works and ends up in column 1 but obviously the first press of key down Appears to do nothing as focus is being given to a grid.  I want a similar behaviour but for the navigation to jump the grid straight into column 1.p

Right now Im looking at Ignition, but it seems it loads all the gallery at once.p

Negative 2939 pHere is the problem I am having. A table that I am querying has 170 million rows. I wrote a stored procedure to do a simple query about the latest entries into the table.

I thought that it might be a datatype problem so I tried various CASTs and CONVERTs and had no success. I tried using codeOPTIMIZE FORcode but realized it would not work on this version of SQL. I checked the datatype of codeStartTimecode it is of type codedatetimecode.p  pAnother thing that I tried, which was very weird, was thisp  precodeDECLARE fifteenDaysAgo datetime SET fifteenDaysAgo  DATEADDd , 15 , GETDATE  SELECT top 500 a.field1 , a.field2, a.field3 FROM database..hugeTable a nolock  WHERE a.StartTime gt fifteenDaysAgo codepre  pI changed it from searching for the last 15 minutes, to the last 15 days. Magically it was superfast again Less than a second.  p  pThis lead me to believe that somehow it is hard for SQL to compare time It didnt need to look at the codeTIMEcode portion of the codedatetimecode to see if it fit the compare statement I dont know. Here I am grasping at straws. p  pSo my question is, how can I make this reasonably fast and still keep my codefifteenMinutesAgocode dynamicp

Negative 2939 pWe use TeamCity for our automated builds and JIRA Atlassian OnDemand for issue tracking.  Our Subversion repository is also hosted by Atlassian as part of our OnDemand service, and we have enabled a precommit hook to require an issue for each checkin.

Is there any way to specify in TeamCity an issue to be included with the commit to label the buildp  pI would prefer to keep the precommit hook active so that we enforce relating code changes to issues.  p

Negative 2939 pI am currently working on mediumsized CUDA project of molecular dynamics simulation, on multiple Tesla M2070. I have the need for a couple sums throughout the program, so I programmed my own reduction kernel that can deal with the 3 dimensions or more of a quantity for ex. velocity in x, y, z directions. p  pSince that reduction kernel can be used for more than one type of data, I had to make it a template function. The kernel also requires a constant variable during its computations, and I wanted to use the constant memory.p  pSince the cards have a Fermi architecture I decided to use the load uniform feature this was necessary to avoid errors due to multiple redefinitions of the codeconstantcode variable defined in the template the variable was being redefined in each file in which I was using the reduction kernel....p  pHowever, it turns out that if I perform a cast operation inside the kernel before calling the copy with the uniform load, the uniform load does not take place. If I perform the cast operation after the load, the load is uniform. It took me a while to figure it out, but I still do not understand why that happens. Fundamentally, by just switching two lines of code I can either get a cached load or not. I am more than curious to understand what is going on behind the scene with nvcc did I miss something in the documentation or did not enable the right compilation flag  p  pI did the compilation with both CUDA v4.0 and v4.1 and got the same results.

Negative 2939 pSuppose I have an app that does inapp purchase and verifies the receipt is good for a nonconsumable purchase.p  pOn a purchase, the app writes to some storage such as NSUserDefaults that is essentially a BOOL that unlocks the extra content.p  pPirates can then make an ipa from this that other jailbroken devices can install, getting around the inapp purchase in the copies by purchasing it once in the original.p  pIt seems like making some hashchecksum based on a unique identifier to the device or user, and verifying this on launch would be a reasonable piracy check not meant to stop all crackers, but stopsthebleeding for the average copy based ipa install pirate. However, I know that apple deprecated access to UDID, and some say to avoid using MAC addresses for this reason.  Is there something else I could use  Is MAC still game This level of a check seems like it would be noninvasive to the user and would store the data as a lossy one way hashchecksum.p  pPerhaps there is a completely different, much better method for dealing with the ipa based piracy for nonconsumablesp

Negative 2939 pIn Matlab, I would like to perform some operations on private members of a class.  I would also like to perform this exact same task on other classes as well.  The obvious solution is to write a function in a separate M file that all the classes call in order to perform this task.  However, that seems impossible in Matlab see below.  Is there another way to accomplish thisp  pHere is the problem specifically suppose I have one m file with the contentsp  precodeclassdef PrivateTest     properties Accessprivate         a     end      methods         function this  directWritethis, v             this.a  v         end         function this  sameFileWritethis, v             this  writePrivatethis, v         end         function this  otherFileWritethis, v             this  otherFileWritePrivatethis, v         end         function printthis             dispthis.a         end     end end  function this  writePrivatethis, v     this.a  v end codepre  p...and another m file with the contentsp  precodefunction this  otherFileWritePrivatethis, v     this.a  v end codepre  pAfter instantiating codep  PrivateTestcode, both of these commands work fine as expectedp  precodep  p.directWrite1 p  p.sameFileWrite2 codepre  p...but this command doesnt work even though its the same code, just in a different m filep  precodep  p.otherFileWrite3 codepre  pSo, it seems like any code that performs operations on private properties of a class MUST be in the same m file as the classdef that defines those private properties.  Another possibility might be to have all the classes inherit a class with the writing method, but Matlab doesnt allow this either.  In one m file, I would have this codep  precodeclassdef WriteableA     methods         function this  inheritWritethis, v             this.a  v         end     end end codepre  p...and in another m file I would have this codep  precodeclassdef PrivateTestInherit lt WriteableA     properties Accessprivate         a     end end codepre  pHowever, after instantiating codep  PrivateTestInheritcode, the command codep.inheritWrite4code causes the same error message as before Setting the a property of the PrivateTestInherit class is not allowed.p  pIn light of this, How is it possible to generalize code that manipulates private properties in Matlab, or is it possiblep

Using an autorotation every 0.02 and an 3.6 angle is the only option that presented smooth results for me.

Negative 2939 pIm currently using EF5 to connect to SQL Server 2012 Express and have got to the stage where a large amount of repeatable Seed Data would be good for testing purposes. I already have a selfcreated, from another project tool which just needs a little tweaking to output a large amount of XML seed data.p  pWhat would be really nice would be, in my C Seed function, simply to pass a connection string to my DbContext class to enable it to import all the data from the XML file, using the same POCO classes I use for my Model. I could then simply copy all the data in to my standard DbContext parameterless initialisation, connects to SQL Server.p  pI can deal with copying the data and outputting it to SQL Server, but is it even possible to specify a connection string to import the seed data from an XML file in this wayp

Negative 2939 pI have a couple different applications where this would be helpful, but for the sake of a concrete example, let us suppose I have a WinForms application.p  pThis application makes use of WPF controls within codeElementHostcode objects.  I now would like to define an implicit style for all WPF Buttons codeSystem.Windows.Controls.Buttoncode so that every codeElementHostcode does not need to merge in the resource dictionary nor does every codeButtoncode need to explicitly specify the style.p  pWhere do I define said stylep  pI have tried creating the resource dictionary codeThemesGeneric.xamlcode in the project root and specifyingp  precode[assembly ThemeInfo     ResourceDictionaryLocation.None,     ResourceDictionaryLocation.SourceAssembly ] codepre  pin the codeAssemblyInfo.cscode.  This did not work and I am under the impression that that styles there are only for custom controls defined in the same assembly, where as codeButtoncode is defined in a foreign assembly.p  pExamples place implicit style code in codeltApplication.Resourcesgtcode however, that node is within codeApp.xamlcode, which the project not having started its life as a WPF application does not exist.  Is it possible to add an codeApp.xamlcode or is there some other place to put codeltApplication.Resourcesgtcode such that they are recognizedp

Negative 2939 pIm new to testing and I need an advice for the best testing strategy and its application. Heres my problemp  pI have a program that reads a file and automatically extracts its structure. I want to test the method that makes this intelligent extraction. Initially I can use a few files to check if the method is doing the correct extraction. Then I want to use these files and the correct extraction results for testing purposes. As the extraction results have been verified they should and must be used for further tests. p  pSo, I have something like emfor this particular file I expect this result.emp  pThe problemsp  ol lipIts easy to get the input files for the test. I will store them in a specific directory. What about the results They affect the contents of the object that stores the file structure. In this case I may need to save this object in a file as well. With serialization Im afraid that with objects structure changes, it will be difficult to reuse the previous saved objects. pli lipWith more and more results I may have hundreds of files and results and the test will take a lot of time. I expect that testing time will not be a big issue.pli ol  pI need testing because my extraction algorithm used in the method will change often. I cant cope with all possibilities in order to have a perfect extraction algorithm. So, my solution is to build an initial algorithm that works in a dozen files and each time that I find a failure in the algorithm for a particular file I change the algorithm in order to solve the problem with that file. This change should be tested in order the previous files and results are still valid.p  pAny suggestion for the testing strategyp

Negative 2939 pI am using an sqlite database to store results in an embedded C application. p  pI have a few singlecolumn tables which I call domain tables, where columns in other tables reference them as foreign keys. These are essentially enumeratedtype tables which are only changed once upon initialization. For example, one table that stores the status data typep  precodeCREATE TABLE statusdomain status TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL UNIQUE INSERT INTO statusdomain VALUES pending INSERT INTO statusdomain VALUES inprogress INSERT INTO statusdomain VALUES error INSERT INTO statusdomain VALUES complete   . . CREATE TABLE myothertable      .     .     status  TEXT NOT NULL,          .     .     FOREIGN KEY status REFERENCES statusdomainstatus  codepre  pThe purpose of the domain table is to make use of sqlites foreign key constraints referential integrity.p  pThe C code that writes to these tables has no awareness of the schema. I am wondering if it would be bad design to duplicate these tables in C. For examplep  precodeenum StatusEnum  pending, inprogress, error, complete  codepre  pI see four optionsp  ol liInsert into codemyothertablecode without knowing whether the status values I am inserting is valid. This will fail at runtime if the status value is invalid.li liDuplicate the codestatusdomaincode with a C enum so that the compiler will not let me perform an insert with an invalid status. This violates the DRY principle since I will have to make changes in both places if the schema changes.li liScrap the codestatusdomaincode table and have the C enum enforce valid data type. The C code will be the only place inserting into these tables, so this seems reasonable. However it is nice to have the status type explicitly declared in the schema.li liMake the sqlite wrapper code more databaseschema aware. I dont think this is worth the effort.li ol  pI am leaning toward option 2, but am hesitant because its storing something that might change in two different places.p  pNote There are a few more longer tables like this that I am not sharing.p

Negative 2939 pIm building a web application using Rails. At the moment Im using Devise with HTTP sessions which was pretty easy to set up and its working well.p  pThe application consists of strongonestrong URL providing an AJAX web application. The rest of the URLs available belong to the REST API. So everything and every little data request is done via AJAX.p  pNow Id like to extend the whole thing to support native clients. I read a lot about stateless auth, http basic and digest auth, http sessions, cookies, xsrf, etc... And now I feel like I cant have a secure app, because theres always a way to hijack some parts of it.p  h21. HTTP session Vs. stateless auth tokenh2  pWhats the difference I dont get it.p  ul lipHTTP sessionp  ol liClient requests a URL first request to the serverli liServer gives the normal response strongplusstrong some unique string  session IDli liClient has to send this string with every request which is done automatically using HTTP headerli liClient logs in  Server memorizes that this particular session ID is now logged inli liClient visits a page which requires auth  Nothing special to do, because the session ID will automatically get sent to the server via HTTP headerli olli lipstateless auth tokenp  ol liClient request URL first request to the serverli liServer just gives the normal response strongwithoutstrong any key or token or idli linothing special hereli liClient logs in  Server creates an auth token and sends this token to the client inside the responseli liClient visits page which requires auth  Client has to submit the auth tokenli olli ul  pFor me both ways look pretty similar. With Rails I can also choose to store the session inside the database... Devise would do the same with the stateless auth token. p  h22. The authentication methodh2  pRight now Im using codePOST userssignincode with codeuseremailemail.com,passwordp455w0rdcode.p  pBut there are other possibilities like HTTP basic auth and HTTP digest auth, but also solutions like oAuth too big for my purpose.p  pFrom what Ive readp  ul liConcerning strongsigninstrong security theres no difference between the current codePOST userssignincode and HTTP basic auth.

Sounds insecure to meli olli ul  h23. CSRF Tokenh2  pAs said above, right now I have just a normal AJAX website using the REST API. It has XSRF protection The website gets delivered by rails and thus has embedded the XSRF token. I read it using AJAX and transmit it when doing a codePOSTcode. Rails then returns the requested data and a new XSRF token, which I then use for the next codePOSTcode.p  pNow I want to change my server application to work with native clients. A native client wont load the HTML page and thus wont retrieve a CSRF token. So the following options came to my mindp  ul liCreate a XSRF token REST resource. So the native client has to request a XSRF token from this resource before it can do the first codePOSTcode.li liDisable XSRF protection entirely.li ul  pQuestionsp  ul liHow does XSRF protection work in Rails How does the server know which token belongs to which client The only way I can think of are sessions. This assumption leads toli liIf I disable session in order to create a fully stateless REST API, XSRF protection wont work anymore. Rightli ul  h24. Stateless auth tokenh2  pHere I have mostly a lot of questionsp  ul liDoes it have the same security problems as HTTP sessions What I mean Stealing the session ID has the same effect as stealing the auth token. Rightli liExpiration of the auth token should work the same as with HTTP sessions The server has to store somewhere database respectively session a timestamp and check that.li lisignout works the same, too ul liSession Destroy session on the serverli liAuth token Destroy the token on the serverli ulli liFrom what Ive read it should be more secure to store the auth token inside the HTTP header just like session ID, because server logs can contain codeGETcode parameters and thus could contain the token.li liShould it just be a plain auth token or would it be better if the client also transmits its userid or even the hashed password a hrefhttpsecurity.stackexchange.coma30710HEREa I read that the client should send ol licodeuseridcodeli licodeexpirationdatecodeli lia hash or whats HMAC of [codeuseridcode, codeexpirationdatecode, codeSECRETKEYcode].

Native Clientsh2  pAs far as native clients are concerned, theres no emeasyem way to use sessionsp  ul lipA native client is strongno browserstrongpli lipThus it wont easily handle cookies and without cookies theres no typical session handlingpli ul  pSo there are 3 possible choicesp  ol lipImplement session handling for native clients. This would be likep  ol liLoginli liread HTTP Header of response to get the cookiesli lisave all cookie data you need especially the one with the session stuff locallyli lisend this session id with every request you doli olli lipDont use sessions at all. From the point of view of a native client its pretty much the same as em1.emp  ol liLoginli liGet some authentication token from HTTP Header or response body its your app, though its up to youli lisave this token locallyli lisend this token with every requestli olli lipThe hybrid approach. This basically means, that the server has to distinguish between browser and native client and then check the provided session id and session data or for native clients check the provided auth token.pli ol  h26. CSRF Token with stateless  no sessionno cookies authh2  pCSRF Protection protects your users from malicious websites, that try to do some request on your API in the name of your logged in user, but without your user knowing it. Thats pretty simple when using sessionsp  ol liUser logs in at your APIli liSession gets createdli liYour users browser will have a cookie set with this session IDli liEvery request your user does do your API is automatically authenticated, because the browser will send all cookies including the session id along with each request to your APIli ol  pAnd thus the attacking website simply has to do the followingp  ol liWrite a custom HTML codeltformgtcode which points to your APIli liLet the user somehow click the codeSubmitcode buttonli ol  pOf course this form will be something likep  precodeltform actionhttpyour.api.comtransferMoney methodpostgt   ltinput typehidden namereceiver valueownerOfTheEvilSite gt   ltinput typehidden nameamount value1000.00 gt   ltinput typesubmit valueWIN MONEY gt ltformgt codepre  pThis leads to the following strongassumptionsstrongp  ol lipCSRF Protection is only needed because browsers automatically send cookies.pli lipNative clients to not need CSRF Protection of course your browser cant access the authentication data token, cookie, whatever of your native app, and your native app wont use a browser to communicate with the APIpli lipIf youve got an API design which doesnt use Cookies to authenticate the user, theres no possibility to do CSRF. Because the attacker must know the authentication token and explicitly send it along with the malicious request.pli ol  pIf you want to oversecure your app, you can of course use CSRF Tokens along with you stateless authentication mechanism, but Im pretty sure, that theres no additional security gain.p  hr  h27. The right HTTP Methods to chooseh2  pLogin  Sign in and Logout  Sign outp  pstrongNeverstrong use codeGETcode for at least three reasonp  ol lipCSRF Protection in most cases only protects POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE and thus a CSRF could login a user without his knowledge when using a GET requestpli lipGET requests should strongneverstrong change the application state. But when i.e. using Sessions the application state changes on loginlogout, because a session gets created or destroyed.pli lipWhen using a GET request and transmitting the authentication information as URL parameters i.e. codehttpyour.api.comloginusernamefooamppasswordbarcode there is another problem Server logs Most servers simply log every HTTP request including all URL parameters. That means If your server gets hacked, theres no need to crack the password hashes from your DB, they must just have a look at the servers log files. In addition a malicious admin could also read the login information for every user. Solutionsp  ul liUse POST or whatever method you like and send the authentication information inside the request body. Orli liSend the authentication information within the HTTP headers. Because those information normally do not appear in the server log files. Orli liHave a look at the server config, and tell it to remove every URL parameter that is named password or obfuscate is, so the URL becomes codeloginusernamefooamppasswordcode inside the logs. But I suggest, to simply use the request body for this kind of information along with the POST method.li ulli ol  pSo you could use for examplep  pcodePOST httpyour.api.comauthenticationcode for loginp  pcodeDELETE httpyour.api.comauthenticationcode for logoutp  hr  h28. Passwords and Hashingh2  pAuthentication only works with some secret key. And of course this key should be kept secret. This meansp  ul lipstrongNeverstrong store a password in plaintext in your database. There are several libraries available to make it secure. In my opinion the best option is codebcryptcode.pli lipstrongbcryptstrong Its been optimized to hash passwords. It automatically generates a salt and hashes the password multiple times rounds. In addition the generated hashstring contains everything needed Number of rounds, salt and hash. Though you just need to store this one String and theres no need to write anything by hand.pli lipof course you can also use any other strong hashing library. But for most of them, youve got to implement salting and using more than 1 rounds yourself. Additionally they wont give you just a single string like bcrypt does, though youve got to manage yourself to store rounds, salt and hash and reassemble it afterwards.pli lipstrongroundsstrong This is simply how often the password should be hashed. When using 5000 rounds the hashing function will return emthe hash of the hash of the hash of the hash of the passwordem. Theres basically a single reason to do this It costs CPU Power This means When someone tries to bruteforce your hash, it takes 5000 times longer when using 5000 rounds. For your application itself it doesnt matter that much If the user knows his password, he will not recognize, if the server took 0.0004ms or 2ms to validate it.pli lipstronggood passwordsstrong The best hashing function is useless, if the password is too simple. If it can be cracked, using a dictionary, it doesnt really matter if you hashed it with 5000 rounds It will maybe take a few hours longer, but what are a few hours, if it could be months or years Though make sure, that your users passwords contain the usual recommendations lower  upper case  numbers  special chars, etc. pp.pli ul  hr  h29. Sending encrypted passwords over the wireh2  pIf you cant or dont want to rely on HTTPS, but dont want to send passwords in cleartext when signing in, you can use asymmetric cryptography  a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPublickeycryptographyhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPublickeycryptographya .p  pThis server creates a key pair public key and private key. The public key is made available to the clients, the private key has to be kept privatep  pThe client can now encrypt data using the public key, and this data can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key  the server.p  pThis should not be used to store passwords in the database, because if your server gets hacked, the hacker will have the encrypted passwords strongandstrong the private key for decryption. Though keep using some hashing algorithm like bcrypt for storing passwords in your database. Another reason is, that you can easily generate a new key pair, if you think that someone cracked you encryption.p  pHTTPS basically works the same way. Though, if your application uses HTTPS which is recommended there might be no big benefit in terms of security. But as stated above, if you cant use HTTPS for whatever reason or dont trust it, thats a way to craft your own secure connection. p  pAnd keep in mind that a real HTTPS connection encrypts the whole connection and all data, not only password data. And it encrypts it both ways, from client to server strongandstrong server to client.p

Negative 2939 pSo, of course, Im having a little trouble right now. Im trying to read a text file that goes something like this in a columnar order. What I would like to do is store the number, character and string columns seperately in arrays.p  precode[Numbers] [Characters] [Strings]  codepre  pNow, while I have figured out how to read the number and character columns into their own arrays, I cannot seem to do so with the string column. At least, not with codefscanfcode or codesscanfcode, which are the commands I want to use. p  pHow can you read a file organized as such using codefscanfcode or codesscanfcode I know about textscan, I want to know if this is possible with fscanf or sscanf. p  pOkay let me add a little code here. So while I was researching this I tried out the following p  precodefid  fopenData.txt, w  i  1 while feoffid      line  fgetsfid      Mi  sscanfline, d, c, s, [3,inf]      i  i1  end codepre  pThis runs, but M ends up coming out only as a row vector consisting of the first column of numbers in the data file. It just completely ignores the existence of chars and strings. p  pNow, to get a better understanding of the sscanf function I tried the following p  precodefid  fopenData.txt, w      i  1     while feoffid          line  fgetsfid          Mi  sscanfline, d, d, d, [3,inf]          i  i1      end codepre  pFor a sample set of data consisting of just columns of numbers. This, incidentally, does exactly the same thing as previously it just reads the first number column of the data and quits. So, I dont even know how to use sscanf, feof, or fgets properly, basically. So I could also use some help here as well.p  pAnd I know trying to read just columns of numbers is trivial with fscanf, but Im trying to understand sscanf and fgets here.  p

A cacheline is usually 64bytes, i.e. 8 doubles. In this simple struct if you iterate over the doubles, you are polluting a cacheline with a string an an int. In other cases, you might get only 1 double transfered per cacheline. That is, you end up using 18th of the memory bandwith available. If you need to iterate over a couple of Gb of doubles, this simple decision improves your application performance by a factor of 67x. And no, I cannot give that up.p  pstrongBonusstrong the answer should be as generic as possible. Think about addingremoving fields to the container type as addingremoving members to a struct. You dont want to change a lot of code every time you add a new member.p

Negative 2939 pTo play I wave file I dop  precodeSoundPlayer p  new SoundPlayermyWaveFile.wav p.Play codepre  pSome wav files cannot play for some reason. For example when trying to play this wave file I get an errorp  precodeSoundPlayer p  new SoundPlayercWindowsMediaAfternoonWindows Balloon.wav p.Play  the exception that I get is   Sound API only supports playing PCM wave files. codepre  pstrongI am looking for a method that could tell me if I could play the wave file such as this methodstrongp  precodepublic void CanPlayWaveFilestring file          SoundPlayer p  new SoundPlayerfile         try                      p.Play             return true                  catch                      return false           codepre  pthe problem with that method is that I might not want to play the audio I just want to know if I can play that file. Also I dont want to have to wait for the wave file to finish playing in order to see if I can play that file later or not. strongSo how can I know if a wave file has this PCM formatstrong. It will be nice if a method SoundPlayer.CanPlayFile existed.p  h2Edith2  pI see people help me see how I can play other formats or convert this format. I dont want to convert it to other formats. I just want to know if I can play them or not without having to have the try catch block...p
Negative 2939 pOk so I have a tabbar iPhone application. The tabbarcontroller contains about 5 view controllers that are each embedded in their own navigation controller with the exception of 1 in which I just added a navigation bar in IB for a consistent look throughout the app. On every navigation bar in the app, I want a rightBarButtonItem that will open up the same modal view controller no matter where it is selected from. Similar to the Now Playing button in the music app, I want the button to stay on every navigation bar regardless of which tab Im on or how deep I navigate into a navigation controller. How would I go about doing something like this Is there some way I could simply apply the button to every nav bar in the same way UIAppearance can apply an image to every nav bar in an app Thanks in advance for any ideas.p

Negative 2939 pI have a feeling the answer will be pretty obvious but I just cant find the answer to my question. So sorry if im asking something that has been asked before.p  pWhen tracing the strongframe heightstrong of an stronguiviewstrong in the stronginitstrong it states that the height is strong480pxstrong.  When i trace the same height strongafter a gesturestrong or out of the codeif selfcode has been done it states that the height is strong460pxstrong, so it removes the status bar from the frame. I dont really understand why this happens, it makes dynamic vertical centering a pain in the ass. I would want the frame to be 460px in the init so i dont have to subtract 10px to get my viewsimages centered.p  pI just made a simple project with nothing in it, ive set it up like thisp  h2Controllerh2  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecode voidloadView      CGRect frame  [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]     self.centerview  [[CenterView alloc] initWithFrameframe]     [self setViewself.centerview]  codepre  pThanks in advance for your help p

Negative 2939 pLet say i have a complex object with many vertices and id like to draw many instances of this object. Im wondering which method would be faster one DrawInstanced or many DrawIndexed. Also which would be faster if id have very simple object, let say sprite with 4 vertices, and id like to draw hundreds of them What i mean I mean that DrawInstanced is a bit like Draw  sometimes it puts the same vertex in VertexShader many times. For example sprite has 4 vertices but with triangle list topology two of them will be processed twice and with DrawInstanced they would be precessed only once. Ofc with more complex objects this problem grows and thats why i asked for solution and yours opinions.p  pSecond part of my question. So, if there is a problem with processing the same vertices many times then maybe there is a way to mix DrawInstanced with indexing or sthp

Negative 2939 pWhile it seems that, in theory, codestdistreamgetcode could be fast, in fact it isnt.  I believe that one reason is that some locking is done for every call to codestdistreamgetcode, and that for singlethreaded programs this isnt needed.  Is there an equivalent to codegetcunlockedcode in C  Or perhaps some method of turning off this locking for I presume a codestdstreambufcode, in Cp

Negative 2939 pIm a novice web designer and have just managed to create my first website using Drupal.

Now, what I want to do is to check every codepostscode method result and if this object has codesuccesscode field set to false, I want to execute codesomemethodcode method. What is the best way to do it I dont want to do this check in every function where I use codepostcode method. Is it possible to create some observer which gets triggered on every codepostcode methods success Thank you.p
Negative 2939 pIs there some kind of list of all common Date and Time formats One of our customers had a problem inputting a date, because he was using something like this code2003. 11. 9code.p  pI already found this very good wiki page a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDateformatbycountry relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDateformatbycountryap  pI am only looking for european countries and relevant formats. Another possibility would be to use C and change the CultureInfo to print out the short date pattern I guess.p  pMaybe someone has better ideas or can help me find other solutions.p

Negative 2939 pI am trying to see if there is a library that will allow me to do merging of a JSON object with a template txt file on the server side. Ideally, I would like it to be able to handle some conditional statements e.g. if, greater than, equals etc. and looping e.g. for.p  pI know there are binding libraries e.g. angularjs, and one option might be to hack it to extract the code required to do this. Alternatively, I could create my own solution, but would rather not reinvent the wheel.p  pI am new to Nodejs, so Im thinking this seems like a problem that might have been solved already.p  pAny ideasp

But, the appearance is very spotty in Chrome because it rounds font sizes to the nearest integer pixel value.p  pAn excellent illustration of the problem can be found a hrefhttpscode.google.compchromiumissuesdetailid254056 relnofollowin this recently filed Chromium issue.a  Looking at this simple markup sample, you can clearly see Chromes fontsize roundingp  precodelthtmlgt     ltbodygt         ltdiv stylefontsize 10pxgtText Text Text Textltdivgt         ltdiv stylefontsize 10.4pxgtText Text Text Textltdivgt         ltdiv stylefontsize 10.5pxgtText Text Text Textltdivgt         ltdiv stylefontsize 11pxgtText Text Text Textltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pChrome renderingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxEzIm.png altChrome font sizep  pFirefox renderingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOPO2Y.png altFirefox font sizep  pIE9 renderingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVpgrb.png altIE9 font sizep  pObviously its a bad sign that the best reference I could find for what I need to do is in the Chromium issue tracker...but I thought it couldnt hurt to ask.

Negative 2939 pIm working on a C library project that will process transactions between SQL and QuickBooks Enterprise, keeping both data stores in sync. This is great and all, but the initial sync is going to be a fairly large set of transactions. Once the initial sync is complete, transactions will sync as needed for the remainder of the life of the product.p  pAt this point, Im fairly familiar with the SDK using QBFC, as well as all of the various resources and sample code available via the OSR, the ZOMBIE project by Paul Keister thanks, Paul and others. All of these resources have been a huge help. But one thing I havent come across yet is whether there is a limit or substantial or deadly performance cost associated with large amounts of data via a single Message Set Request. As I understand it, the database on QuickBooks end is just a SQL database as well, but I dont want to make any assumptions.p  pAgain, I just need to hit this hard once, so I dont want to engineer a separate solution to do the import.

Negative 2939 pIm working on a program that will convert an image to grayscale, or invert the colors.

Negative 2939 pI am working with a Jetty server, and have a servlet that produces large responses of well over 65536 bytes in size. I tried curl, wget, and python urllib2 to request the content at the url of the servlet, but all have a truncated response body size of just 65536 bytes, which leads me to believe that the limit is on the server. Interestingly, if I run the server on my desktop rather than a production server, there does not seem to be a cap of 65536 on the response size for the same servlet. Can someone explain why this might be happening and how I might resolve it and send larger responsesp

Negative 2939 pI have a task doing some background work which I want to throttle. I want to inject the codevoid ThrottletaskStatecode method. It can be as simple as codeThread.Sleepdelaycode for debugging purposes, but it can be more complex, doing some logging etc. p  pIm choosing between a delegate and an interface with a single method, as a parameter to the constructor of the taskdriving class. strongWhich option to takestrong p  pIMO, when it comes to DI, the major advantage of interfaces over delegates is extensibility. New methods can be easily added. I can create codeinterface I2 I1  ... code, have the class implement codeI2code, and still inject an instance of it as codeI1code. The client code has an option to cast it to codeI2code, to see if the new features are supported.p  pHowever, if I need to inject just a single method, I think a delegate would make more sense, regardless of whether I need to maintain state or not. Delegates can maintain state too, e.g. p  precodestatic ActionltTaskStategt GetThrottleint delay        return s gt Thread.Sleepdelay   codepre  pId explicitly type my delegate, rather than using codeActionltgtcode or codeFuncltgtcode. p  pCurrently, I plan to have a separate codestaticcode class with various codeThrottlecode implementations like above. p  pIm not using any DI frameworks for this projects.p  pstrongIs this the right choicestrong Should I go with an interface instead p  pIf you think the answer would be mostly opinionbased, just vote to close this question, thatd help too.p

Negative 2939 pSo, with the Text Kit additions to iOS7, its very easy  three lines of code  to make an NSAttributedString from an RTF file. It works great, and even RTFD files work. However, in searching Apples docs, there doesnt seem to be any roundtrip capability. I.E. They dont provide a way to save an NSAttributedString back to an RTF.p  pDoes anyone know of an open source solution that would enable that capability in iOS7 I know theres at least one app Textilus that does this, but I need to incorporate that capability into my own apps. Ive reviewed past questions on here, and done a general search of the web, but the only thing I have found are links to a github project that gives a 404 now. I would really like to be able to make an RTF editor,and the only missing piece is saving to RTF. I thought I would ask on here before I resort to building it myself.p

Negative 2939 pIm reading a scientific a hrefhttpwww.cin.ufpe.braltmestradooodmetrc.pdf relnofollowpapera about OO Design Quality Metrics written by Robert martin.p  pIn his paper he describes a set of metrics that can be used to measure the quality of an objectoriented design in terms of the interdependence between the subsystems of that designp  pHe goes on about how there should be a good balance between abstraction and instability. Here are the metrics he writes about and how they can be calculated p  pstrongNastrong  The number of concrete and abstract classes and interfaces in the package is an indicator of the extensibility of the package.p  pstrongAfferent Couplings Castrong The number of classes outside the package that depend upon classes within the package.p  pstrongEfferent Couplings Cestrong The number of classes inside the package that depend upon classes outside the package.p  pstrongAbstractness Astrong The ratio of the number of abstract classes and interfaces in the analyzed package to the total number of classes in the analyzed package. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A0 indicating a completely concrete package and A1 indicating a completely abstract package.p  pstrongInstability Istrong The ratio of efferent coupling Ce to total coupling Ce  Ca such that I  Ce  Ce  Ca. This metric is an indicator of the packages resilience to change. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I0 indicating a completely stable package and I1 indicating a completely unstable package.p  pstrongDistance from the Main Sequence Dstrong The perpendicular distance of a package from the idealized line A  I  1. This metric is an indicator of the packages balance between abstractness and stability. A package squarely on the main sequence is optimally balanced with respect to its abstractness and stability. Ideal packages are either completely abstract and stable x0, y1 or completely concrete and unstable x1, y0. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with D0 indicating a package that is coincident with the main sequence and D1 indicating a package that is as far from the main sequence as possible.p  pI made the following simple design.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsokaI.png altenter image description herep  pIm confuse about the last metric D. If I calculate the metric DD in the picture, I get a negative value of 0.5. But if I read the description is says the value should be between 0 and 1. Also a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSoftwarepackagemetrics relnofollowwikipediaa states that for metric interfaces are also considered as abstract classes. But I cant make this up from the paper. Is this true p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDqAHF.png altenter image description herep  pDid I do something wrong Is believe this design, although really small, isnt that bad rightp

This is one approach to in.p  precodedeclare MyTable table UserID int, StartDate datetime, FinishDate datetime, GroupCount int  insert into MyTable values  6, 20140318 102000.000, 20140318 131000.000, 2, should take StartDate from this row  and Enddate from next 2 row 6, 20140318 133500.000, 20140318 162500.000, 1, 6, 20140319 120500.000, 20140319 145500.000, 1, 21, 20140314 145000.000, 20140314 154000.000, 1, 21, 20140318 133500.000, 20140318 165500.000, 1, 99, 20140310 080500.000, 20140310 105500.000, 2, 99, 20140310 112000.000, 20140310 141000.000, 1, 99, 20140311 102000.000, 20140311 131000.000, 2, 99, 20140311 135000.000, 20140311 164000.000, 1 codepre  pselect  from MyTablep  pI need to find a way  to group them somehow together  so I have the min StartDate and max FinishDate.p  pIn the end  it should look like thisp  precodedeclare MyResult table UserID int, StartDate datetime, FinishDate datetime  insert into MyResult values  6, 20140318 102000.000, 20140318 162500.000, 6, 20140319 120500.000, 20140319 145500.000, 21, 20140314 145000.000, 20140314 154000.000, 21, 20140318 133500.000, 20140318 165500.000, 99, 20140310 080500.000, 20140310 141000.000, 99, 20140311 102000.000, 20140311 164000.000  select UserID, StartDate, Finishdate, datediff minute, StartDate, FinishDate as Duration, LEADstartdate,1,NULL overpartition by userid order by startdate NextDuty,   DATEDIFFminute,FinishDate,LEADStartDate,1,NULL overpartition by userid order by StartDate as DifMin     from MyResult codepre  pwell  this also depens on a UserID. The GroupCount  was just an idea... but I do not know how to jump for 2 records  to select next start  GroupCount field etc. 2 would indicate  the current and next record belong together, 1 only this actual record. There would be also 3 or 4  records belonging together. All should be done in MSSQL 2012.p

Considering codeCHARBITScode and all. Im thinking one needs to read an array of 512 codeuint8tcode for this, and after that maybe convert them to chars, one by one. Any easier way p
Negative 2939 pFirst, i want to say that I have read dozens of articles about inheritance mapping or polymorphic fetch with hibernate without finding solution to my problem.

ManyToOne     JoinColumnname  fruitid, nullable  false     private Fruit fruit   null  codepre  pThe fetch is not LAZY so I shouldnt have any problem with the proxy. I  dont understand why hibernate is not able to find out that such Fruit is an Orange or Apple as the Fruit table contains in DTYPE column the discriminator Orange or Applep  pI would be very grateful to solve this problem. sorry for my vague englishp  p. .p  pAfter further research I found that DiscriminatorOptionsforce  true could solve my trouble but finally...helplessly. What I have learned is that even if hibernate has all the information to find what is concrete class, annotation like DiscriminatorOptionsforce  true are needed in some cases. Anyway, i would like to tell hibernate  hey hibernate dont try to instanciate  abstract Fruit class, because it is abstract. hey hibernate try rely on entity with DiscriminatorValue set on .. but hibernate is deaf p

Negative 2939 pIve noticed that some webpages that would otherwise return 403 errors when urllib2 is used to fetch them will return content if the user agent is set via the addunredirectedheader function. If the user agent is set via addheader these page will still return 403s, even when the user agent string matches that of a web browser that can successfully load the page. It is only when addunredirectedheader is used to set the user agent that the page content is returned, and in these cases it seems like the user agent can be set to anything. Why does setting the useragent in an unredirected header avoid 403sp

Negative 2939 pIve written a simple cython wrapper for donlp2, a C optimization library. The library uses global variables extensively and assumes the caller has written functions with predefined names so the function can call them. e.g., there is a function ef and egradf that evaluate the function and its gradient, respectivelyp  pThe wrapper was pretty simple to write using cdef extern for the global variables and cdef public to create the functions the C library expected. I also used view.array to cast double pointers to cython arrays that could be passed to python functions. Doing that my wrapper is able to use the C library to optimize functions amp gradients defined in pure python. p  pBelow is the wrapper codep  precodefrom libc.string cimport strcpy from cython cimport view  cdef extern void donlp2  global varaibles used by donlp2 only import those variables that are necessary  cdef extern int n cdef extern int nlin cdef extern int nonlin cdef extern int nstep cdef extern int iterma  cdef extern int icf cdef extern int icgf  cdef extern double x cdef extern char name[41]  cdef extern double del0 cdef extern double tau cdef extern double tau0 cdef extern int analyt cdef extern double epsdif cdef extern int nreset cdef extern int silent cdef extern double low cdef extern double up cdef extern double optite  Below are used only if bloc is True cdef extern double xtr cdef extern double fu cdef extern double fugrad cdef extern int bloc  class DonlpProblem          Contains all the inputs, including python functions, to      solve a constrained nonlinear problem using donlp2.           def initself,                  x0,                   ef,                  egradf,                  low,                  up,                  nonlin,                  activeConstraintTolerance,                  name,                  blocFalse,                  evalexternNone,                  econNone,                  maxIter4000,                  maxBacktrackIter20,                  descentVsFeasibilityWeight0.1,                   analyticDerivativesTrue,                  silentFalse,                  nreset4         self.bloc  bloc         if self.bloc             self.evalextern  evalextern         else             self.ef  ef             self.egradf  egradf         self.econ  econ         self.n  x0.size         assertnonlinself.n  low.size         assertnonlinself.n  up.size         self.x0  x0         self.low  low         self.up  up         self.nonlin  nonlin         self.maxIter  maxIter         self.maxBacktrackIter  maxBacktrackIter         self.name  name         self.activeConstraintTolerance  activeConstraintTolerance         self.descentVsFeasibilityWeight  descentVsFeasibilityWeight         self.silent  silent         self.analyticDerivatives  analyticDerivatives         self.nreset  nreset      def runself                  Solve problem using donlp2.                  global globalDonlpProblem         globalDonlpProblem  self         donlp2      def userinitsizeself                  Set global variables related to problem size and maximum number         of iterations.                  global n, nlin, nonlin, iterma, nstep         n  self.n         nlin  0         nonlin  self.nonlin         iterma  self.maxIter         nstep  self.maxBacktrackIter      def userinitself                  Initialize various problem data unrelated to sizes.

Negative 2939 pAfter copying from an HTML table into Excel, everything appears to be normal. But if you try using any of the copied numbers in a formula, it doesnt work  for example if you select a column and click the SUM button, the cell underneath just says SUM rather than correctly summing the column. Its as though it doesnt recognise the copied cells as numbers. Formatting cells as number or currency makes no difference. when i tru to calculate the sum of a row , it gives me a zero like result and to have the right result i have te delete all the thousand separator.p  pSaving the spreadsheet as a text file reveals that every number is followed by an aacute character, which is not displayed but is clearly causing the problem.p  pDoes anyone know what i can do about thisp  pThis is actually for a web application with an option to copy Data to excel, so if someone could tell me what to do about this problem programatically, that would be great.p

Its possible the remote servers are responding at a very slow pace and therefore the timeout never actually occurs, but I find this unlikely as my issue does not occur with just one specific domain.p  pI am using Rabbit 3.1.3  celery3.1.11 Cipater kombu3.0.16 py3.4.0 billiard3.3.0.17 pyamqp1.4.5. I am using prefork.p  pIm using requests2.3.0.p  pSo why does it appear that my tasks hang after codeurllib3code logs the codeStarting new HTTPS connectioncode statementp  pstrongEDIT Ive added a lot

Negative 2939 pI have an app that has a navbar on everypage, so I factored it out into index.jade that inherits from my layout.jade file. This is fine for 99 of my app. p  pThe only place it runs into issues is on the login screen as it just feels weird to have a navbar at the login screen, so I used angular to check a boolean against a rootScope variable and hide the navbar if you are on the homepage. p  pThis is okay but the navbar still loads for a split second, then it disappears. I know I could correct this by not factoring it out into a single file and just cramming it into every single jade file besides the login page, but this would be a maintenance nightmare.p  pIs there a way that I can keep my navbar factored out, hide it on the login screen using nghide, and not load at all until I login.p  pThis is my code to give you an idea of what I did.p  pThe controller that checks to see if you are at the root of the app p  precodeangular.moduleapp.controllerLoginCtrl, functionscope, http, mvIdentity, mvNotifier, mvAuth, location, rootScope    rootScope.currentPath  location.path  ....  .... codepre  pThe jade file that shows how this variable is being used to hide the navbarp  precodeblock maincontent   section.content    nav.navbar.navbardefaultnghidecurrentPath, rolenavigation .... .... .... codepre  pThen upon successful login, the currentPath variable gets set to false to bring the navbar back.p  precoderootScope.currentPath  false codepre  pI would like to keep this set up because that means any changes to the navbar can be made in a single file and would be inherited across the app, cutting maintenance down tremendously, but I would like for the navbar to wait to load until login.

Negative 2939 pI need to know how to access a file or folder over a network. Lets say I have a network called workserver, and, of course, in order to access it, I would type workserver, followed by the folder or file I would like to access.p  pNow, I know that I can use that filepath to access the file or folder.

The problem is, that the application itself is pretty complex and separating possible cause is impossible. The possible causes might includep  ul liGeneral WPF slowness not probableli liTelerik library same as aboveli liWriteableBitmap, which is used heavily even when user doesnt make any actions yes, SetDirty is used properlyli liWCF used to receive large amount 5kBs on constant basis through TCPli ul  pIm asking if there is any relevant information about this issue.

Negative 2939 pOur Java Spring project has some acceptence tests that run with a strongspring contextstrong codeSpringJUnit4ClassRunnercode that gets initialized once upon test execution and is kept alive for the entire cycle. p  pThe strongtests used to run finestrong inside the project where the classes under test are located. We strongadded more and more testsstrong but then it strongstarted to freeze upstrong. When this first happened, I moved the acceptence tests to their own project and it ran fine again. After adding more tests, it now freezes again, but not when reaching the old running amount of tests but much earlier.p  pNow, after maybe 3040 tests, execution aborts with a codePermGen space errorcode.  strongIncreasing Heap size will accomplish nothingstrong.p  pstrongVisualJvmstrong shows a sudden explosion of strongheap allocationstrong from 1Gb to 2 just before it freezes. p  pThis cannot be tracked down to a single test. I am assuming that too many objects are being kept in memory but I cannot be sure.p  pSo I was wondering, if I could strongsplit the execution of all tests into chunksstrong of maybe 20 tests. After each chunk, the spring context should be reinitialized and thus hopefully trigger garbage collection and free the heap.p  pI dont want to use strongforkMode  alwaysstrong with surefire to get a fresh context for EVERY test. This will work but slows down execution to an unacceptable length.p  pMy only pointer so far is the use of strongmaven test groupsstrong or strongprofilesstrong with the strongsurefire pluginstrong. I did manage to split the tests but obviously maven now runs only one of them during its test cycle, depending on which one I want. p  pHowever I dont want to explicitly specify a specific group to run but strongrun all of them, one after the other with a single build  commandstrong. p  pMaybe thats not possible and I will have to set up our Jenkins with several builds that each run a profile  group  suite or execute a strongbatch scriptstrong to run them all after each other..

Negative 2939 pA while back, I ran into an issue when developing for both SharePoint and standard .NET Framework projects on the same machine where the correct assembly was not loaded at runtime for the nonSharePoint solution. The issue stemmed from an assembly in the GAC created by the deployed SharePoint solution during testing, which was loaded by a separate project instead of the correct assembly. strongThe two assemblies had the same version, but different target frameworksstrong. Needless to say, this caused quite a bit of frustration when I received errors at runtime claiming that my DLL was missing members that I knew existed in the assembly I had referenced in my projects.p  pFor now, Ive resolved this with major and minor version numbers that match the target framework, but this leaves me with only the build and revision to differentiate between versions of actual content of the DLL.  If I were to expand this practice to support framework versions like v4.5.1, Id only be left with the revision component.p  pIs there any way I can prevent loading an assembly in the GAC by the target framework without sacrificing strong namesp

Negative 2939 h1Problem Abstracth1  pThere is a macro that declares an overload of specific function.

Basically what I try to achieve is to make a namespaced version of compiletime registration trick posted by Roman Perepelitsa see original post for more information about this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21626087httpstackoverflow.coma21626087a.

The trick is done by combination of inheritance codectrRankltgtcode and overloading codectrGetTypescode, so it is certain that overloaded version needs to be declared every time a type is registered at caller side.p  pThe problem is, Id like to make caller to be ANY namespace. For example, I tried to compile following code but failedp  precodeinclude ctr.hpp  namespace foo      struct integers   CTRREGISTERTYPEfoointegers, int ERROR    ctrAppendltctrTypelistltgt, intgttype    ctrGetTypesfoointegers, ctrRanklt1gt   should have been declared inside ctr codepre  pId like to know any workaround is possible for this kind of problems.

Negative 2939 pFirst off, sorry for such an unclear title and such a long post. If you keep reading youll understand why I couldnt be more specific.p  pIm developing a Windows desktop GUI application I used PyQT4 which takes a string input from the user in textArea, queries a SQLITe database for user data and then pass both variables as arguments to a Scrapy spider that downloads some files from a website using that info.p  pEverything is running properly on my development machine. However, since people who will be using the application cannot have installed neither Python nor Scrapy on their computers I decided to package the application in a .exe not bundled in one file.p  pI came across some errors libraries missing, Scrapy version bug, etc. but I finally made it work with a setup.py that looks like thisp  precodefrom distutils.core import setup import py2exe  setup     windows[myapplication.py],     options py2exe      includes[sip, scrapy, lxml.etree, lxml.elementpath, gzip],     packages[twisted, pkgresources],         dllexcludes [MSVCP90.dll] codepre  pThe app worked on my machine correctly but failed on the users computers when calling the Scrapy spider because I run it with this command...p  precodesubprocess.callscrapy crawl mySpider a userinputself.userinput a userdatastrself.userdata, shellTrue, creationflagssubprocess.SWHIDE codepre  p...which calls scrapy on cmd and requires having scrapy installed.p  pThen I tried emrunning scrapy from scriptem which seemed the logical workaround. Unfortunately I cant go for that solution since twisted.reactor emisnt restartableem and I need to allow users to recall the spider as many times as they wish from a emsubmitem button while the GUI is visible.p  pThen I thought calling the spider programatically with scrapys cmdline.execute could work.

Negative 2939 pHaving programmed in C for 15 years, Ive recently started to work with Objective C and theres one thing that I dont really understand Several methods return a pointer to an object but I dont own this object. Instead, people say that I need to retain this object for as long as I need to access it.p  pLets take the return value of [NSTextField stringValue] as an example. This method will return an NSString to me. But I dont own this NSString, so if I want to work with it Ill have to retain it for as long as I need it, e.g.p  precodeNSString s  [myTextField stringValue] ...               why cant the object become invalid during this time [s retain]   ....              do some work [s release] codepre  pWhat is really puzzling me here is the time between the call to [myTextField stringValue] and [s retain]. I dont own the NSString, so who guarantees that the pointer to the NSString is still valid when I do the retain call in the third line of my code abovep  pThe code above is of course very simple but as it has to be guaranteed that the s pointer is still valid when calling retain, doesnt it also have to be guaranteed that the pointer is still valid when I call retain on the string much later Lets say 4 hours after calling [NSTextField stringValue] I mean, I could even store the NSString pointer in a global variable and call retain on it much much later or is there a rule that retaining must happen in the current scope or really soon after getting the pointer and not 4 hours later Still, its difficult to understand how the Objective C compilerruntime should keep track of all this. p  pFrom a C programmers point of view it looks like retaining is somewhat superfluous in the code above because the pointer returned by [NSTextField stringValue] must stay valid anyway if its possible to call [retain] on it. But that of course cant be the case. Im sure it all makes sense once you get the idea but currently Im still struggling to understand this because its contradictory to what Ive been doing in C all those years.p  pHopefully theres somebody who can shed some light on this. Thanksp

Negative 2939 pI notice, upon reading Keenes book, that codedefgenericcode has a codemethodcode option, which seems like it allows you to specify a method in the generic definition itself.

Negative 2939 pFirst off. I am sorry if this not the right Stack Exchange site to ask this on. p  pI am looking to a theoretical introduction to Vector Graphics. In particular to how their curves and paths are stored as datastructures. When I say theoretical I mean some resource preferably a textbook which discuses both the mathematical theory e.g. emwhyem are we representing a curve like this and the computational aspects e.g. emhowem we represent the mathematical representation in a computer, why we do it this way, etc. of curves and surfaces.p  pI have searched around quite a bit but I tend to find either books on pure mathematics, differential geometry, manifolds, etc. or books purposefully written to avoid the hairy details of vector graphics, such as an introductory book on computer graphics for freshman game designers. p  pBefore anyone suggests it, yes I have looked at the source code of some vector graphics libraries. It seems that different libraries take different approaches. Hence the desire for a deeper understanding of the topic.  p

Negative 2939 pI am using an codeArrayAdaptercode along with codeListViewcode to display some images I use Picasso to help with image handling. The images are initially loaded from the state on the local device. The adapter has codeidscode for the images, which the codegetViewcode method of the adapter uses to get the path. If the image is not available locally, the local state returns an URL for the image. If the URL has expired, I need to fetch this from the backend.p  pIf the URL is not expired, I have no issues, as I can either directly provide the path to Picasso or the URL and Picasso will handle everything for me. However, when I need to fetch the URL from the backend, I need to do this asynchronously. After fetching the URL, I tried doing the following but it doesnt seem to work my codegetViewcode will in this case use Picasso with the URLp  precode        adapter.removeid         adapter.addid codepre  pcodenotifyDataSetChangedcode doesnt seem to do much as well.p  pWhat is the best way to handle this situation Is there any other way than what I am trying to do with the adapters I want to delay the URL fetch from the backend as much as possible, basically until the user needs to see the image.p  pUPDATE for now, I am replacing the codeidcode with a codetempidcode when the URL is expired and then add the correct codeidcode again, when I have the valid URL so that the view gets refreshed.p

Negative 2939 pSo, recently I managed to land myself a Kinect v2 project hurray on my Industrial Placement which is supposed to detect if a person is wearing the correct PPE or personal protective equipment to you and me.p  pIncluded in this scope is detecting if the person is wearing the correctp  ul liHazard Protection Suitli liBootsli liGlovesli liHatli liA beard mesh Only if they have a beardli ul  pI have only recently begun working with the Kinect v2 Sensor so you will have to forgive any ignorance on my part. I am new to this whole game but have worked through a fair few examples online. I guess I am just looking for advicesources on how best to solve the problem.p  pSources online seem scarce for trying to detect if a person is WEARING something. There are a couple of parts to this projectp  ul liSplit up human into components hands, feet, head, body while retaining colour. This part I imagine would be best done by the Kinect SDK.li liGive a percentage likelihood that the persons hand part is wearing gloves, head part is wearing hat etc... Ive seen some ideas for this including graphics packages such as OpenCV.li ul  pIm looking for advice concerning both parts of this project. Feel free to ignore the waffling below, but I thought it best to post some of my own ideas first.p  pIdea and worked example 1  Point cloudsp  pI have done some preliminary projects involving basic detection of humans. In fact, grabbing the VS project from this source a hrefhttplaht.inforecord3dvideowithkinectv2andplayitbackinthebrowser relnofollowhttplaht.inforecord3dvideowithkinectv2andplayitbackinthebrowsera I have managed to create a .ply file out of human beings. The problem here would be trying to split the .ply 3D image up to identify the suit, hat, gloves, boots and I guess beard. I imagine this is a fairly complex task.p  pOf the 3 ideas however, Im coming back around to this one. Splitting up a 3D .ply image and trying to detect the PPE could turn out to be more accurate. Would need advice here.p  pIdea 2  Blob Detectionp  pUsing this a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comcoding4funkinectKinectOpenCVWPFBlobTracking relnofollowhttpchannel9.msdn.comcoding4funkinectKinectOpenCVWPFBlobTrackinga I pondered whether there would be a good way of splitting up a human into a colour picture of their hand part, head part, body part etc with the Kinect v2 SDK. Maybe I could then use a graphics package like OpenCV to test if the colours are similar or if the logo on the suit can be detected. Unfortunately, there is no logo currently on the gloves and boots so this might not turn out to give a very reliable result.p  pIdea 3  Change the PPEp  pThis isnt ideal but if I cant do this another way, I could perhaps insist that logos would need to be put on the gloves and suit. In this worst case scenario, I guess I would be trying to just detect some text in 3D space.p  pSummaryp  pId be grateful for any advice on how to begin tackling this problem. Even initial thoughts might spark something p  pPeacep  pBenjamin Biggsp

Negative 2939 pI have a Debian Wheezy Server that I installed BIND9 on it. I configured it to work with codeexample.comcode, but now I wanted to change that to a differnet domain, codemyOtherDomain.comcode. I went through the zone file creation and removed all records that I found of codeexample.comcode. But it still pointed to the same IP. So I went and removed the pacakge of BIND9 by codeaptget remove bind9code and codeaptget remove purge bind9code but the IP still points to the domain. What am I missing How can I change this p

Negative 2939 pIm using jQuery 2.1.3 on an Asp.net MVC site that renders partial views to certain site areas.  A partial view can contain a script block that manipulates the area DOM.

For simplicity I have made this example that alerts both 1 and 2p  precodebody.htmlltdiv idtargetgtltscriptgtalertdynamic dom 1ltscriptgtltdivgtltdiv idsourcegtltscriptgtalertdynamic dom 2ltscriptgtltdivgt  codepre  pBut if the first script manipulates the DOM, and moves the div containing the second script tag, emthe entire script isnt executedem, and I only get alert 1p  precodebody.htmlltdiv idtargetgtltscriptgtalertdynamic dom 1target.appendsourceltscriptgtltdivgtltdiv idsourcegtltscriptgtalertdynamic dom 2ltscriptgtltdivgt  codepre  pIm not getting any JS errors that could stop executionp  pIm using codejQuery.appendcode, that should and in fact does strongmovestrong the div element.p  pI have tried using codereadycode handlers to ensure that the DOM is fully loaded, but with the same effect.p  pThis only seems to be a problem with dynamically loaded HTML. It works if I include the code in a plain html file, but with a single page MVC site thats not a usable workaround.p  pIs this a bug in codejQuery.htmlcode or codejQuery.appendcode, or am I using it wrongp  pEDIT Im not having problems adding the script tags. Im not quite sure how added script tags are executed, and how one added script can affect the execution of the other. This could be the source of the problem. If you know how jQuery handles this, then please elaborate.p  pEDIT 2 I have recently made a big jQuery update, and this code worked with older jQuery versions. In fact, this works with jQuery1.8.3, but not with jQuery1.9.0 or later. In this update jQuery marks inserted scripts as executed to prevent them from being run several times.p  pSee a hrefhttpbugs.jquery.comticket11795 relnofollowhttpbugs.jquery.comticket11795ap  pand a hrefhttpjquery.comupgradeguide1.9loadingandrunningscriptsinsidehtmlcontent relnofollowhttpjquery.comupgradeguide1.9loadingandrunningscriptsinsidehtmlcontentap  pI know that it is poor practice to mix JS and HTML, but with MVC partial views it helps maintainability and overview to keep the JS and HTML in the same view file.p  pNevertheless, I think that jQuery somehow wrongfully marks the second script to have been executed, when in fact it has not. Can someone please explain how scripts are marked as executedp

Negative 2939 pId like to record i.e see the SQL passed from client to SQL Server when using SQL Server native client 2011.110.5058.00 on win 2008r2 64 bit machine.  A profiler trace on the server shows no evidence of a call, so I want to see whats happening on the client.p  pThe client software is Informatica, and Im not privy to the set up of the connection to sql server.p  pThe error messages vary a bit.   Sometimes it looks like variable values are being interpreted as SQL syntax.   Sometimes SQL server says there are data type mismatches.   As a DBA, I think the issue is the app, but at the shop Im at I need to prove its not the database.p  pProfiler does show some connections from the informatica server being OK.  However, one particular database always throws the errors in the app.  Always means there are two informatica servers and either one throws the same error.  Both informatica servers work fine with other connections to the DB server and to other SQL db servers.p  pAlso, profiler shows no evidence of sql hitting the db for the problem connection. p
Negative 2939 pIm using the OFED 3.18r2 implementation of Infiniband drivers for my application. In particular Im using the rdma connection manager wrapper functions. To understand better whats going on under the hood Im used to look at the source code. Doing this I came into something that looks like a pattern but I cannot understand it. Lets make an example. The rdma connection manager functions are in cma.c. Looking for example at the rdmalisten call this is common to almost every functions defined in the library that start with rdma ip  precodeint rdmalistenstruct rdmacmid id, int backlog      struct ucmaabilisten cmd     struct cmaidprivate idpriv     int ret      CMAINITCMDampcmd, sizeof cmd, LISTEN     idpriv  containerofid, struct cmaidprivate, id     cmd.id  idprivgthandle     cmd.backlog  backlog      ret  writeidgtchannelgtfd, ampcmd, sizeof cmd     if ret  sizeof cmd         return ret gt 0  ERRENODATA  1      if afibsupport         return ucmaqueryaddrid     else         return ucmaqueryrouteid  codepre  pip  pHere you can see the pattern I mentioned beforep  pip  precoderet  writeidgtchannelgtfd, ampcmd, sizeof cmd codepre  pip  pthe first argument to the write call is the file descriptor associated with the i devinfinibandrdmacm i, but what I cannot understand the usage of the i cmd i arguments. I dig into the source only to find that i cmd i is a struct that comes for the ABI definition of the rdma cm function calls. I really dont understand if this is a common pattern to execute device driver calls and how it works, where is the real code associated with the cmd argument. Could you please help mep

Negative 2939 pI was thinking about making a decorator for the purpose of increasing performance. A decorator that modifies the source code of the function it decorates, and returns the modified function.p  pWhile thinking this through, I figured that if I could just get the source code of the function, I could do this.

Otherwise, it seems that I can get the source code.p  hr  pAs a rough sketch of the first thing thats on my mind, Im thinking of tailrecursion. I wrote this decorator that is unfortunately slow and requires a very specific style of writing the function to be decoratedp  precodedef tailrecurseaccdefault     def decoratef         def wrapperargs, accaccdefault             args  args  acc,             while True                 returntype, rargs  fargs                 if returntype is None                     return rargs[1]                 args  rargs         return wrapper     return decorate codepre  pBasically, Im thinking of doing something as simple as replacing the body of a function withp  precodewhile True     body     updateargs codepre

Negative 2939 pI have an app which I have localised into several languages. Part of the app involves speaking sentences in the appropriate language using AVSpeechSynthesizer.p  pThe strongproblemstrong is that if the device is in a region that I have not yet localised, it will use the Base localisation strongwith the regional voicestrong. I would like it to use an English voice if its speaking English otherwise it just sounds odd.p  pI have looked into using codeNSLocale.currentLocale.localeIdentifiercode, however I would ideally like to avoid this as it would involve checking against every language I support. Additionally, it gets even more messy when I have to check each region as well as language enGB AND enUS for instance. It would be much simpler if there was a way to check the currently used localisation e.g. Base.p  precodeif NSLocale.currentLocale.localeIdentifier  en  NSLocale.currentLocale.localeIdentifier  es  NSLocale.currentLocale.localeIdentifier  ru  NSLocale.currentLocale.localeIdentifier  ruGB  NSLocale.currentLocale.localeIdentifier  ja  NSLocale.currentLocale.localeIdentifier  sk  NSLocale.currentLocale.localeIdentifier  skUS          responseUtterance.voice  AVSpeechSynthesisVoicelanguage enGB      codepre  pYou can see that that will get messy very quickly.p  pstrongSo I need a way to tell if the device has defaulted to the Base localisation if it tries to use a localisation that is not there so I can set the default voice to English in such a case.strongp  pThanksp  pLoicp

Negative 2939 pThe app is a single page, so its not being refreshed, and our hope is to leave it running on an android device for extended periods of time.p  pWere currently seeing a crash and a logcat report indicating an OOM error when running on android after about 18 hours. When I use remote debugging and capture a timeline using chromes dev tools it is quite apparent that we have a memory leak because we see a steadily growing js heap. The heap seems to continue growing until I force a garbage collection.p  pAnother thing that seems peculiar to me is that on timeline I can also see that our event listeners are growing and appear unaffected by the forced GC.  Could this be the problem all on its own Were talking 10s of thousands of listeners according to the Timelinep  pDoes anyone have any advice beyond the standard 3 snapshot heap analyzing technique Its not very helpful here because the heap is growing even when it is not being interacted with, which I believe to be due to some of the periodic updating we do behind the scenes to read and display data. Otherwise Im entirely open to any other memory analyzing tools altogetherp  pI have very little experience in the area so any advice at narrowing down the cause of these nasty leaks would be terrificp  pUnfortunately, due to the nature and size of the program, it is very difficult to provide helpful code snippets. I apologize for the long question.p  pEDIT  One of my strongest suspicions is that when I look in the dev tools timeline and see that the listeners keep increasing, and never get garbage collected... Could that eventually be causing a crash p

Each users data is stored in DynamoDB under the user ID Simple example, i know the background of scaling NoSQL databases. Profile images and other user content is stored in S3 buckets and linked in the DB user record. Elasticache limits load when viewing user profiles by reducing the calls to the DB.

Negative 2939 pI am writing a program using OSG and I would like to step through it to see how stuff works, change a few lines and debug again. However every time I need to load a file using osgDB plugin for openflight. The debug version of the plugin works quite slow. I have no intention of debugging the plugin itself, so I figured I might as well use the release dll. I read that I can do this as long as there are no memory allocation  in program and freeing in dll or visa versa and if the dll was designed to avoid problems that might occur with releasedebug mixing. Im not sure if codeosgdbopenflight.dllcode was designed like that. p  pstrongMy questionstrong can I use the release plugin dll in my debug build, and how can I make my program use itp  pstrongUPDstrong I achieved my goal following the XenonofArcticuss advice. p  pSome additional thoughts on the topic for the sake of better understanding I also tried to simply rename the release dll, so it would get loaded in the debug build. I thought this would work, because I usually use release dlls in debug builds  Windowss, SQLs and other 3rd party dlls, that do not come with debug info. Also see Igor Tandetniks comments on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25829619usingdllindebugorreleasemodethis questiona.  It did and the program didnt crash, however it also didnt load the file. Apparently this particular dll wasnt designed to be used in debug builds. Any other explanation p

Negative 2939 pWe have a multi user Java SE desktop, Swing based application which uses Spring Data JPA. The Spring Application context is loaded using ClassPathXmlApplicationContext and the application works perfectly fine for a single user. When multiple users logon to the application Application Context is created for each user. p  pLoading the Application Context multiple times is utilizing more CPU which is causing the application performance to degrade. The application is designed in such a way that each user gets their own instance which makes it harder to share Application Context. p  pIs there a way to centralize Application context to be loaded only once irrespective of the user signing in to the application. p  pAny suggestion would be greatly appreciated p

So I guess the question is, does anyone have any kind of experience with NPOCO and saving data into oracle, I mean I tried with and with out the Mapper and I get the same error.

Negative 2939 pthis is a follow on from a previous question I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32606485callinganasyncmethodusingataskrunseemswrongCalling an async method using a Task.Run seems wrongap  pI thought the code written by the contractor was wrong but following on from the answers provided Im now wondering if its the libraries fault. This library exposes two methods that I need to use. One returns a template and one consumes part of this template it does in my implementation anyway. But both are codeasynccode methods returning codeTaskscode. p  pTo explain my library has methodsp  precodepublic TaskltTemplateInfogt TemplateInfoTemplateInfoRequest request public TaskltListltEmailResultgtgt SendMessageTemplateSendMessageTemplateRequest request codepre  pI need to call these thusp  precodepublic bool SendMessage    var template  TemplateInfo...   var message  use template to create message   var sendResponse  SendMessageTemplatemessage     return sendResponse.Count gt 0  codepre  pSo the second call relies on the first. This is where the async doesnt make sense to me. strikeI cant and dont want to run these in parallel. I want to run them in sequence.strike I want strongmystrong method to by synchonous. p  pAn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma32607091542251answer in my previous questiona also statesp  blockquote   pSince youre blocking on an async method strongwhich you shouldnt dostrong   there is a chance youll deadlock.p blockquote  pSo how do I access these codeasynccode methods in such a way that they are processed in turn and return a synconhonous result but do not cause deadlocksp

Negative 2939 pMy DBA and I are trying to work out how to effectively use Microsofts Database projects and the Dacpacs they generate to simplify our production deployment system.  p  pIdeally, I would be able to build andor publish the code.sqlprojcode, generating a code.dacpaccode file, which can then be uploaded to the production server and used to upgrade the database from whatever version it was to the latest version.  This is similar to how were doing website deployments, where I publish to a package, and then that package is uploaded to the server and imported into IIS.p  pHowever, we cant work out how to make this work. The DBA has already created the database and added it to our Availability Groups.  And every time we try to apply the Dacpac, it tries to adjust settings which it cant because of the AGs.    p  pNothing Ive been able to do has managed to create a code.dacpaccode file which emdoesntem try to impose settings on the database.   The closest option Ive found will exclude them when publishing, but as best as I can tell you cant publish to an inaccessible database, and only the DBA has access to the production server.p  pstrongCan I actually use dacpacs this waystrongp

Negative 2939 pIm going to develop an android app which needs very high efficiency even with a heavy weight database. in that case, i thought of having a hybrid database which include both SQL lite and noSQL. Is it possible to do thisp  pIf possible, I need to know what is the best no SQL for my task. I did several researches and came up with Couch DB. but I read this article and I found it interesting to use Sparksee. a hrefhttpswww.quora.comWhataresomegoodmobileDatabasesRelationalorNoSQLforandroid relnofollowhttpswww.quora.comWhataresomegoodmobileDatabasesRelationalorNoSQLforandroidap  pCan anyone tell what is the best option for my solutionp
