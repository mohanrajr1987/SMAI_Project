Positive 3822 pIm working on a componentization system based on JSPs. This means that parts of the JSP can be moved from one JSP to an other one via drag and drop and leads to a need for a local page scope as variable of a component defined in one JSP my collide in an other JSP. I can use Servlet 3.0  JSP 2.2  JSTL 1.2.p  pstrong Tag File strongp  pThe straight way of doing that would be to create a tag file for a component or something similar as they have this local page scope. But for every change in the tag file it would need to get redeployed and needing to create a tag file needs some time by itself. But if there is no other solution this direction custom tags, tag files, JSP includes,... is probably the way to go.p  pstrong Namespace prefixingsuffixing strongp  pIn Portlets one is supposed to concatenate each variable with a namespace provided from the portlet response object. I could do something similar but this can lead to side effects and unexpected behavior. If someone forgets to prefixsuffix the namespace it might work for some time but stops working at an other time without changing the code when the component moved to an other JSP with a conflicting variable name.p  pstrong Custom Tag wrapping strongp  pI was hoping that I as a component framework developer can wrap the component code of a component developer with a tag file for a component tag like thisp  precodeltacomponentgt     ltdiv datacomponentid9gt         ltcset varcomponentId value9gt         ltcset varpath valueabcgetCurrentPathcomponentIdgt         ltcset varresource valueabcgetResourceFromPathpathgt         ltcset varval valueresource.getValueparagraphValuegt         ltpgtltcout valuevaluegtltpgt         ltdivgt ltacomponentgt codepre  pto have the variable in the local page context of the tag file. But instead they are in the context of the surrounding page. Im looking for something like thisp  precodelt  gt     ltdiv datacomponentid9gt         lt         String componentId  9         String path  obj.getCurrentPathcomponentId         Resource resource  otherObj.getResourceFromPathpath         String value  resource.getValueparagraphValue         gt         ltpgtltcout valueltvaluegtgtltpgt       ltdivgt lt  gt codepre  pwhich would create a code block in which variables have their own namespace. But of course for JSTL and JSTLEL instead of scriptlet code. I had a look at the JSTL specification but did not find out if there is a way to create such a local page scope. But I didnt check everything as its huge and Im not sure if its possible with custom tags.p  pIt is clear to me that bigger code blocks should not be in the JSP but with the framework I would like to provide simple solutions for smaller components.p  pstrong Changing the JSP code strongp  pWhen components are initially placed on a JSP or moved around via drag n drop I actually move the JSP code of a component from one JSP to an other or within a JSP. This means I can also programmatically manipulate the JSP code of a component if it doesnt get too complex and it helps solving the problem.p

Negative 3822 pI have the following problem some processes, generated dynamically, have a tendency to eat 100 of CPU. I would like to limit all the process matching some criterion e.g. process name to a certain amount of CPU percentage.p  pThe specific problem Im trying to solve is harnessing foldinghome worker processes. The best solution I could think of is a perl script thats executed periodically and uses the cpulimit utility to limit the processes if youre interested in more details, check this a hrefhttpdev.calyx.hrblogp143blog posta. It works, but its a hack p  pAny ideas I would like to leave the handling of processes to the OS  p  hr  pThanks again for the suggestions, but were still missing the point p  pThe slowDown solution is essentially what the cpulimit utility does. I still have to take care about what processes to slow down, kill the slowDown process once the worker process is finished and start new ones for new worker processes. Its precisely what I did with the Perl script and a cron job.p  pThe main problem is that I dont know beforehand what processes to limit. They are generated dynamically.p  pMaybe theres a way to limit all the processes of one user to a certain amount of CPU percentage I already set up a user for executing the foldinghome jobs, hoping that i could limit him with the etcsecuritylimits.conf file. But the nearest I could get there is the total CPU time per user...p  pIt would be cool if to have something that enables you to say The sum of all CPU  usage of this users processes cannot exceed 50. And then let the processes fight for that 50 of CPU regarding to their priorities... p  hr  pGuys, thanks for your suggestions, but its not about priorities  I want to limit the CPU  even when theres plenty of CPU time available. The processes are already low priority, so they dont cause any performance issues.p  pI would just like to prevent the CPU from running on 100 for extended periods... p

Negative 3822 pWe have an old legacy PHP application. Now I want to write a new application module using Ruby on Rails. p  pDeployment is a one problem. I guess that it should be possible to run PHP app via modphp and RoR app via modproxy  mongrel on a one Apache server. I dont want to use modrails because it requires to run php via fcgi. So is a risk of breaking something. Both PHP and RoR will use the same DB.p  pThe tricky part is how to pass login info from PHP application to RoR app. Users login into PHP and their info is stored in PHP session data. The RoR app will be placed in a subdirectory of main PHP app eg www.example.comrailsapp. So RoR should receive all HTTP cookies. And the question is how to extract PHP session data from RoR app.p  pAbove this is just my first idea which is rather bad because of possible race conditions between PHP mod and RoR. I can modify the PHP app to store some info in DB when a user logs in. But I dont know how to handle a case when PHP session data expired and some data in DB should be updated logout a user.p  pDoes anyone solved similar problem Or at least can point a most promising directionp  pUpdate It should be possible to configure modphp to store session data in sql DB. In this way there will be no race conditions. DB engine should prevent race conditions. p  pUpdate2 Actually it is possible to use modrails with Apache in prefork mode. Which is required by the modphp. It is just recommended for modrails to run Apache in worker mpm mode. So the whole deployment of PHP  RoR apps is greatly simplified.p

But for a mockup I did not implement any of the Social Network design patterns such as a login, rating, groups etc..  This brought me to a higher level of decision making requirement, I need to decide if I want to develop all this functionality by hand or use some kind of a framework.p  pI spent this entire day researching, and it would seem that using Drupal and such frameworks will make the Social Network part easy overlooking the customization requirement for now.. but will make client side Web App development less so.p  pI found some other frameworks that are more developer friendly customizable such as Zend and Symfony etc.. strongbutstrong these seem to take allot of the power from the client and implement it in the server side, to me this seems a waste and an unjustified performance bottleneck ..p  pFinally I found Aptana Jaxer framework that seems to think the same way I feel. That said it seems a bit underdeveloped, I didnt find modules for a social network and the community around it seems thin.. searching Jaxer in StackOverflow returns few results So other then making server side DB comm a bit simpler it does not help me greatly.. p  pMy requirements are a good facility to develop web apps on while containing all the user centric logic usually used for social networks in advance.p  pstrongWhat would you recommendstrongp  pEDIT OK, lats fine tune this question, after considering this abit further, is there a good down loadable source of a social network site in PHP that I can work around in building my web app I really like using JQUERY AJAX JSON etc..p

The libcomplex maintainers have also included this bugfix into libcomplex 1.1.p  pYoure not ready to release calc 2.0, so you need to integrate libcomplex 1.0.1 into your vendor branch and then update calc1.0 to make a bugfix release.p  pWhere does it gop  pYou cant put it at svnlocalhosthomesvnvendorlibcomplexcurrent because 1.1 currently lives there.p  pDo you copy svnlocalhosthomesvnvendorlibcomplex1.0 to svnlocalhosthomesvnvendorlibcomplex1.0.1 and then bring in the new release That way you could use svn to merge the diff between 1.0 and 1.0.1 to calc1.0. p
Negative 3822 pI have a Ruby on Rails app that has a scheduled job I execute using cron and scriptrunner.p  pThe purpose of the job is to find any updates that are past due stale, see below and after executing the job update the due date of the job a predefined number of minutes into the future.p  pThe problem Im having is that when I set the due date, the GMT time is used.  However, when I search for stale jobs, the local time seems to be used.  The local time of the server is 7 hours offset from GMT, so the system goes 7 extra hours between updates.p  pExample  The due date of the job is 0600 on a certain day.  The system finds that job at 0600 west coast time 7 GMT.  If the job is due again in 15 mins, it sets the due date to 0615 which gets changed to 1315 when the object is saved 15 mins and 7 hours into the future.p  pIll insert the code below.  If it makes any difference, markupdated is part of a model and self.stale is a classlevel function in a module that is included in the same model.p  pBTW...bonus question  how to get catch the SQL that is being executed from scriptrunner job in Production  That would make this easier to debug.  Im guessing a little at what is happening.p  precodedef markupdated   self.nextrefreshdueat  Time.now  updateintervalinminutes.minutes   save end  def self.stalemax  3   newssources  NewsSource.findall,                                conditions gt [nextrefreshdueat lt , Time.now],                                order gt nextrefreshdueat ASC,                                limit gt max    return newssources end codepre

Negative 3822 pI am facing a very strange issue. I have a SharePoint webpart that displays an asp.net tree view. It takes tree depth from a drop down. To improve performance of the tree view, i am setting the PopulateOnDemand property to true for the last level of the tree depth.p  pFor example, if i have a total of 10 levels in the data and the user selects tree depth as 3, then the third level data i set PopulateOnDemand to true. p  pNow comes the strange part. When i click on the  image on the third level, and if there are children under that particular node then call back happens and node gets expanded. But if there no children for that particular node, then click  throws Input string was not in the correct format error.p  pI have made sure that there is no server side error. Some things looks to be fishy when internet explorer is trying to bind construct the expanded node.p  pPlease let me know if any one faced similar issue or the resolution for the samep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 3822 pstrongNOTICE I have edited the question below which is more relevant to my real issue than the text right below, you can skip this if you but Ill leave it here for historic reasons.strongp  pTo see if I get this right, a codefloatcode in C is the same as a value in radians right I mean, 360  6.28318531 radians and I just noticed on my OpenGL app that a full rotation goes from 0.0 to 6.28, which seems to add up correctly. I just want to make sure I got that right.p  pIm using a codefloatcode lets call it codeanglePitchcode from 0.0 to 360.0 its easier to read in degrees and avoids casting codeintcode to codefloatcode all the time and all the code I see on the web uses some kind of codeDEG2RADcode macro which is defined as codeDEG2RAD 3.141593f  180code. In the end it would be something like thisp  precodeanglePitch  direction  1  direction will be 1 or 1 refY  tananglePitch  DEG2RAD codepre  pThis really does a full rotation but that full rotation will be when codeanglePitch  180code and codeanglePitch  DEG2RAD  3.14code, but a full rotation should be 3606.28. If I change the macro to any of the followingp  precodedefine DEG2RAD 3.141593f  360 define DEG2RAD 3.141593f  2  180 codepre  pIt works as expected, a full rotation will happen when codeanglePitch  360code.p  pWhat am I missing here and what should I use to properly convert angles to radiansfloatsp  pstrongIMPORTANT EDIT REAL QUESTIONstrongbr I understand now the code I see everywhere on the web about codeDEG2RADcode, Im just too dumb at math yeah, I know, its important when working with this kind of stuff. So Im going to rephrase my questionp  pI have now added this to my codep  precodedefine PI         3.141592654f define DEG2RADd d  PI  180 codepre  pNow, when working the pitchyawn angles in degrees, which are codefloatscode, once again, to avoid casting all the time, I just use the codeDEG2RADcode macro and the degree value will be correctly converted to radians. These values will be passed to sincostan functions and will return the proper values to be used in GLUT camera.p  pNow the real question, where I was really confused before but couldnt explain myself betterp  precodeangleYaw  direction  ROTATESPEED refX  sinDEG2RADangleYaw refZ  cosDEG2RADangleYaw codepre  pThis code will be executed when I press the LEFTRIGHT keys and the camera will rotate in the Y axis accordingly. A full rotation goes from 0 to 360.p  precodeanglePitch  direction  ROTATESPEED refY  tanDEG2RADanglePitch codepre  pThis is similar code and will be executed when I press the UPDOWN keys and the camera will rotate in the X axis. But in this situation, a full rotation goes from 0 to 180 degrees and thats whats really confusing me. Im sure it has something to do with the tangent function but I cant get my head around it.p  pIs there way I could use sincos as I do in the yawn code to achieve the same rotation What is the right way, the most simple code I can addfix and what makes more sense to create a full pitch rotation from 0 to 360p

Negative 3822 pIve got a python crawler crawling a few webpages every few minutes. Im now trying to implement a user interface to be accessed over the web and to display the data obtained by the crawler. Im going to use phphtml for the interface. Anyway, the user interface needs some sort of button which triggers the crawler to crawl a specific website straight away and not wait for the next crawl iteration.p  pNow, is there a way of sending data from the php script to the running python script I was thinking about standard inputoutput, but could not find a way this can be done writing from one process to another process stdin. Then I was thinking about using a shared file which php writes into and python reads from. But then I would need some way to let the python script know, that new data has been written to the file and a way to let the php script know when the crawler has finished its task. Another way would be sockets  but then I think, this would be a bit over the top and not as simple as possible.p  pDo you have any suggestions to keep everything as simple as possible but still allowing me to send data from a php script to a running python processp  pThanks in advance for any ideasp  pEdit I should note, that the crawler saves the obtained data into a sql database, which php can access. So passing data from the python crawler to the php script is no problem. Its the other way round.p

Negative 3822 pSo, RAD 7.5 comes with IBMs own code coverage tool which seems alright.

Negative 3822 pIm creating a grid system for a bunch of our own apps  portals. We have the basic grid width and gutter, etc in place but we are considering making the grids a little responsive. Considering that, we wanted to make an elastic grid system. While, Ethan Marcotte does pen down the basics of responsive design neatly a hrefhttpwww.abookapart.comproductsresponsivewebdesign relnofollowin his booka, he doesnt consider talking about the effect of this approach in browsers...sigh..p  pAs far as I have explored, percentage widths which are essential for a fluid  elastic layout have been a major pain for Opera  Safari. This is a prevalent bug in Opera, and even the fluid 960gs is faulty on Opera  safari.p  pThe only place where I could find percentage widths working was in YUI2. Any YUI developer around interested in detailing out how they made percentage widths work on Opera  Safari p  pThis is an SOS, for experienced developers and grid creators, who could advise  guide on workarounds  solutions to make such a thing work across browsers. p  pThanks a ton Sanjayp

Negative 3822 pThe release version of Rails 3.1 is having some weird issues with precompiling a sass manifest file with the extension codescsscode.

Negative 3822 pIm writing a HTML5 application that I want to release on the iOS app store. Either using PhoneGap or wrapped in a UIWebView control.p  pIm a bit confused about what options I have in terms of storing data for my application.p  pAre using localStorage, WebSQL or IndexedDB technologies appropriate for storing application data in this type of application I will be storing JSON and XML data.p  pKeep in mind, if the user inadvertently deletes this data then they will have lost their work, which obviously I dont want to happen.p  pI understand that the only real way to alleviate this risk is to sync the data to the cloud or other online system  I can do that in a future release, but not right now. Initially I just want to store the data locally if that is a reasonable stable way to do things.p  pFrom what I understand, when clearing the cookies the browser will also clear any localStorage data. So that rules that out, as I can see users doing that by accident.p  pWebSQL looks pretty good  the user cant inadvertently delete it on iOS. They would actually have to go into the browser settings and delete the database manually.p  pBut the downside of WebSQL is that it may not be supported in the future from what Ive read.p  pWith IndexedDB, I am not clear when that data gets cleared. Will it also removed when cookies are deleted, or does the databases option in the Safari settings control thisp  pIs IndexedDB the better solution, as it will have better support than WebSQL in the futurep  pAre there other solutions that are more appropriate that I am not aware ofp

Negative 3822 pI have a client who wants to return an ENORMOUS query from a web service, and will not budge. They are adamant that the query must be able to return absolutely everything, and they also will not allow us to do any sort of server side paging.p  pWe have it working so that it returns all the data just fine, and we have it displayed in an ASP.NET GridView. In order to speed up the rendering of the huge grid, we decided to implement clientside paging, but Im not exactly sure how to go about this.p  pCurrently, we store the whole of the data in the ViewState, and then page and sort based off of that so as to avoid hitting the server again.p  pHowever, with the default set up, when trying to select any page but the first, it returns a 404 error. Im guessing this is because it times out while trying to send the enormous data set via the ViewState.p  pIs there any sort of way to return the data set, and then do all of the paging and sorting all on the client without having to do any sort of post back Or is there some other way to do this that we havent thought of besides server side paging. We would LOVE to do it this way because it is so obviously the right way, but the client wont budge...p  pstrongEDITstrong I would like to stick to the ASP.NET GridView control if at all possible.

If I comment out the line SL.Add... and RECOMPILE it will work again. If I include it again and RECOMPILE it wont. This leads me to believe that something is messing up the memory at some point due to my incorrect implementation of these interfaces, and the inclusion of the extra code makes it happen.p  pI am pretty sure that the types I have assigned to the variables are in some way the culprit of this, especially the second parameter to EnumParams which is supposed to return an array of GUID. I am also very uncertain about the IParamConfig.EnumValidValues call which is also returning arrays of values.p  pI am using Delphi XE2.p  pAny help on this issue is greatly appreaciated.p

Negative 3822 pHow can I get an accurate speed from GPS in Android Yes, I am aware of the codelocation.getSpeedcode method in the codeLocationcode class. Problem is, the default implementation returns 0.0 as speed apparently a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4811920whygetspeedalwaysreturn0onandroidthat is the default behaviora.p  pWhat Im currently doing, is as follows, consider location objects a and b, where a is taken first, b laterp  precodea.distanceTobb.getTimea.getTime codepre  psimplified for readability, original code deals with history codeArrayListcodep  pProblem is that this is somewhat inaccurate under normal circumstances, the data points are so close to one another that the GPS inaccuracy really becomes an issue. Either I would need to reduce the update frequency or calculate the speed relative to a point further away. The former I dont want to do, as I want to get as high a frequency as possible, but perhaps I could filter the points to calculate speed against based on their distance to one another The optimal solution, which I assumed the codegetSpeedcode method would do, would be to calculate the speed against the GPS satellites themselves, thus getting a more accurate result.  Am I using the codegetSpeedcode wrong somehowp
Negative 3822 pForgive my ignorance of .Net, phppython programmer here.  I am providing a client who uses .Net with a javascript include that contains a form. When I provided the first iteration of this javascript include, the form submission was being intercepted by .Net and so it wasnt properly submitting where it should.  Ive been trying to read up on whats at issue here, but the best I can figure out is that the whole page is wrapped in a form and so the .Net form wrapper is intercepting any children form submissions.  So, I have since changed the code to have event listeners on the form object itself that is being included and thus forcing the form to submit properly.  What I am wondering is, will this even work, or is there something Im missing  Any enlightenment would be appreciated as this particular client is difficult and I dont want to send them something that doesnt work.p

Negative 3822 pIn reviewing a project I am working on, I have stumbled upon several places where the same text string appears in multiple resource .resx files.p  pI would like to review all such duplicates because I believe that in the majority of cases there is no reason for the duplication i.e. the text in question is used in the same context and should be moved to, or used from, a resource file that is accessible to all places that text needs to be used.p  pIs there any easy way to identify such duplicates, either directly in Visual Studio or using an addin like ReSharperp  pstrongEditstrong I should perhaps give an example of one of the situations Ive already found and fixed so the problem is a little clearer. I found three instances of the text string Continue in the same project. Each instance had a different name e.g. nameContinue, nameContnue [sic] and nameAdvanceToNextPage. Two instances appeared in the same .resx file, one appeared in a different .resx file, and since they were all within the same project the text could and arguably should have been pulled from an entry from the main PropertiesResources.resx file.p

Negative 3822 pI am currently attempting to develop a player that can perform accurate seeking based on an mpeg4 elementary video stream. Im in the planning stage and trying to decide how to go about things and Id like some advice before I start. Some things to note arep  ul liI will have complete control over the encoding of the file.li liThe original content will be Iframe onlyli liFFmpeg is the encodingdecoding libraryli liAudio can be disregarded for now. I will only be dealing with the video stream.li liFrame accurate seeking must be implementedli ul  pSo, when Im encoding the content, can I query what type of frame I, P, B has been encoded so I can construct an additional index stream for the seeking operation. If not, I can query the GOP after it has been encoded to find the Iframe.p  pAs for playback, the user needs to be able to type in a specific time and go to that frame the nearest Iframe will be suitable for now. We can assume that the GOP is closed and the length is fairly short e.g. 15 frames. My thoughts are to query the index stream that I created during encode and determine the relevant distance into the stream for the requested time.p  pIm not sure how to seek using the FFMpeg library when playing back files.p  pHas anyone done anything similar and if so, can you give a brief explanation of how you did itp

At that moment, it should write the value of codepcode at that memory address. li liIf the compiler does NOT assume so, emevery time codepcode is read, the compiler should fetch its value from memoryem as there is a chance some other thread modified it.

Negative 3822 pIm trying to figure out how to shrink the sizes of EXE files compiled under the newest QT SDK 4.8.2 mingwg based.  I was working on a vanilla c console app that has a simple loop and only includes iostream, when I noticed that the exes it generated are about 465kb way bigger than they should be  Commenting out all the stream stuff brings it down to the expected 5kb range although the remaining code would be mostly dead.   This doesnt seem right at all, especially since another, full project Im working on has a QGLwidget, windowing, a dozen data structures and 3000 statements and only clocks in at about 126Kb.

I can make the libgcc one go awayat the expense of 17kb of exe size by adding codeQMAKELFLAGSRELEASE  staticcode to the .pro, but the mingwm10.dll stays either way, calling a single function.p  pBased on the overall bloating, and all the useless framework stuff that the compiler is trying to sneak in networking, at least.

The program is then happy to populate my struct fields with whatever random data is in there.p  pstrongWhat is a safe way of casting struct pointersstrongp  pI cant use dynamiccastlt as its not a class.p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 3822 pWe have an java application in which the user can writeexecute their own java code and use imports from compiled jars  i.e. they write it, and it is compiled and run by the application.

This is better than nothing, but still a rather involvedcomplicated process. Also, there is no checking that the code in the save files are consistent with the code in the compiled project.p  pOne approach that I am considering is a script or a test class that would unpack the save xml file, writing the java code to java files, and then try and compile and possibly runningtesting those java files. p  pA further step would be to write a maven plugin we use maven for our build cycle or an ant script ant still has its uses... to do this, and possibly make this part of our build process  i.e. you cannot compile the project without ensuring all of the save xml files in its subproject also compile.p  ul liDoes this seem like a reasonable approachli liAre there alternative approaches that anyone could suggestli ul

Negative 3822 pWaveMaker is a powerful ajax based UI builder, but its JSONRPC API standard is incompatible with our web service, which only has a RESTful API. As a result, we would like to design an UI without using any service using WaveMaker, and only extract part of its source code that runs on browser side discarding all servicesp  pUnfortunately, we can neither view or test the extracted code all .html files show an empty page, a javascript reference in index.html is pointing to runtimeLoader.js, which we cannot find anywhere. So, is it possible to deploy the browser side code on a web container not an application container like Tomcat without runtimeLoader.js If this is not possible, how do I change the source code so it can be tested without using WaveMakerp

Negative 3822 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1HWY5.png altReport, tablix cell expand I am facing a very weird problem while creating a report in SSRS I am using  sql server 2012 enterprise edition.p  pThis is the structure of my reportp  ul liReport columns are in Page Header section, not in  tablix header. I had to  remove report columns from tablix header because I needed my report to freeze its header or its column after exporting to excel. This freezing in excel could be done only when columns are in Page Headerli liTablix has fields with several groupings.li ul  pNow what happens, when I run the report and if any field having a larger string value than the size of tablix cell, it grows badly in width. That makes my report looks  ugly. Columns in page header are not aligned with  their rows in tablix. Tablix  goes out of the report actual width .p  pFor getting rid of this problem, I tried making  codeCanGrowfalsecode  of every cell in tablix. I then tried deploying the report, but failed. I got an  error codeReport definition is invalidcode.p  pThe  problem is, I cant set codeCanGrowfalsecode to cells in tablix then how would my report remain  stable. How would my columns be  aligned with the data in tablix.p  pI just  do not want the cells to grow in width that they are doing right now.p  pAttaching a screen shot of the report I saw when  I have a larger value in  a cell. This value is a whole word.p  pPlease help me out. Any help appreciated.p

Negative 3822 pI have this problem in PostgreSQL where I am parsing a webpages meta tags and then inputing the requesting into pgquery.

But if I copy the query that was executed and run it through something like pgadmin, it works. So the query is not invalid.

Negative 3822 pI have a Google App Engine app that stores data in a number of languages, like e.g. German and Russian.

Negative 3822 pI am trying to create an underline transition for my menu items. On hover, I want a nice blue underline to start from left to right. I followed the answer in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15489203underlinecss3transitionthis posta.p  pIt works, but the only problem is that since this method sets the width of my li elements to 0, my longer menu items get wrapped into two lines instead of one. This is precisely the problem that a commentor of that solution CBroe warned about. Heshe suggested to use after to generate an element after each menu item and position the generated element beneath the link. That way, I can expand and contract the width of that generated element instead and my menu items themselves wont be wrapped.p  pAny idea how to do this Im sorry if this is confusing, I tried my best.p

Negative 3822 pI am currently developing a website in PHP and I decided to go with a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenbook.gettext.php relnofollowgettexta to manage the translations. I set up a nice a hrefhttppootle.translatehouse.org relnofollowPootlea server so that I can easily manage the translations and a bash script that runs with cron that extracts all of the values from the PHP files to be translated and creates the code.potcode translation template file.p  pSo far, so good. However, I just remembered that part of the text of the site is stored in a database. Lets call it products for simplicity. I want the product description, name, and a few other fields to be translatable, but it would be great if I could have a centralized way to translate them without having to create a separate interface just to translate the database entries. Since Pootle is already set up, it would be nice to be able to use that.p  pI thought of two solutionsp  ol liForget using a database and use only PHP arraysli liWrite a script that will extract all of the values from the database and generate a file that will then be scanned by the aforementioned bash script and add the values to the codepotcode file, and another script that will run just after the bash script to reupdate all of the values in the DB.li ol  pNeither of these solutions really seem to be ideal. The first one would be easy to set up and easy to use with Pootle, but I lose all flexibility that comes with using a DBMS and I would have to import the entire array every time I want to use it. Loss of functionality isnt really that bad, because I currently am not performing any advanced calculations on the rows, basically just codeSELECTcodes and thats it. The second one, could work, but would take significantly more planning and coding to set up correctly.p  pAre there any other ways that Im missing that would give me the flexibility of a database, but allow me to easily translate it in a centralized place along with the rest of the site, like Pootlep

Negative 3822 pIm trying to generate a sound with a specific frequency using 8086 assembly.

Negative 3822 pIve been reading some answers on here about using PowerMock to mock the System Date function in Java, but it seems that its necessary to add the annotations to the actual class being tested. Let me set this question up a bit. Im interning at a large corporation doing unit testing on a system with Spring, JUnit, Mockito, etc. My current task at hand is testing an endpoint that has a dependency on the current time against a DB kind of like checking for an expiration date. p  pstrongMy question isstrong is it possible or intuitive to mock the System Date in a test class without touching the main source code I dont want to modify the source code even though its on a testing environment Id rather just keep it untouched. Or would it make more sense to just modify a DB entry to change the date, perform my test, and then use a transactional test rollback Thanks a bunchp  pThe class Im trying to mock is codejava.util.Date cDate  new java.util.Datecodep

This means about 200 overloads or even more.p  pDo C compilers impose any limits to the number of overloads a function can have What about overloads of member functions and constructors Where would such limits if any be documentedp

Negative 3822 pI have 2 JARs that are supposed to be imported into a maven project. I followed this tutorial click a hrefhttpcharlie.cu.cc201206howaddexternallibrariesmaven relnofollow titlehereherea and imported those JARs into my maven project. Basically, I executed this code in the terminal codemvn installinstallfile Dfilemyfile.jar DgroupIdmygroup DartifactIdcom.mygroup.project Dversion1.0 Dpackagingjar DlocalRepositoryPathlib DcreateChecksumtruecode and then I imported the library into my Maven project.p  pAll this works fine. However, the JARs I am importing are supposed to have few dependencies themselves. As I understand, Maven handles the internal dependencies automatically. Now I have a list of dependencies with group ID, artefact ID and version but I dont understand where do I write those. In the folder 1.0 of the library, there is a file called myjar1.0.pom. I tried writing the dependencies there but it was of no use.p  pCould you tell me a way of manually telling Maven to load up a few dependenciesp  pI also tried specifying these dependencies in the main empom.xmlem but it results in errors  saying the emrepourldependencyfile.pomem was not found. So I guess it needs to be mentioned in internal dependency only  but I cant figure out a way of manually defining them. Will I need to create a pom.xml within those libraries, or is there something that I am missing outp

Negative 3822 pDoes Firefox have any support at all for the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebSVGAttributealignmentbaseline relnofollowcodealignmentbaselinecode propertya  When I inspect using Firebug SVG elements for which the codealignmentbaselinecode property has been explicitly set, Firebug does not list this property at all IOW it treats is as noise.  No matter what value I assign to this property, the appearance of the displayed text never changes, further suggesting that FF ignores this property altogether.p  pOne other sign that FFs support for this property may be busted is that the link given in the page cited above for the CSS documentation for this property is a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebCSSalignmentbaseline relnofollowdeadasadoornaila.p  pAssuming that, as it appears, FF does not support the codealignmentbaselinecode property, what is the value of this property that would most closely replicate FFs default behaviorp  pEDIT For example, view this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netAPWE33 relnofollowjsFiddlea with both Chrome and FF each line of displayed text displayed a highlighted word that has been produced with code of the following formp  precodelttspan stylealignmentbaselinealphabeticgtalphabeticlttspangt codepre  pNote that all the lines look the same in FF, but not so in Chrome.p  pThere are a few possible candidate values for this property to replicate FFs default behavior namely, codeautocode, codealphabeticcode, codemathematiccode, and codeinheritcode unfortunately, this experiment cannot decide the matter, and its not clear to me which of the possible options would match FFs default behavior in the greatest fraction of cases.p

Negative 3822 pApparently Google Visualization Pie Charts dont like very small values. Ive created a JSfiddle to demonstrate the issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettechnotarekYRKHd relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nettechnotarekYRKHdap  pWhen you load the fiddle, youll see the pie chart has four categories as one would expect from examining the JS in lines 613. Now, try changing the third value in line 13 of the JS from 5 to 1 and then run the fiddle. Youll see that it changes the label on the pie graph to a new label of other.

Negative 3822 pIm new to Neo4J.  Ive built a project that uses springdata and succeeded to create entities, add relationships with properties. All seems to run well except for updating relationships properties values, after they were once persisted.p  pTo try to explore it, I merged the simple worlds example from SpringData documentation and enhanced it a bit.

Then, I call the WorldRepositoryService.updateYearsToOtherWorld and set the yearsToReach to 20.

Negative 3822 pIm trying to run a project in Eclipse Indigo where my main class containing the main method is in an external .jar file I created from another project. The program is run based upon passing the name of a class in the current project to the main method as a command line argument. p  pWhen I try to run this project, the first few lines of the main method in the .jar are executed, but then the program exits. The debugger has informed me that it exits with an error code of 1. No exceptions are thrown or at least, none appear in the console or in my trycatch blocks and I make no assertion statements of calls to codeSystem.exitcode.p  pWhen run directly, the main method completes normally.

The constructor doesnt contain anything other than a syso call for debugging.p  pAny help in getting this program to run correctly would be appreciated.p

Negative 3822 pI am having a slight problem in interpretation of OpenCL spec in regards to the clfastrelaxedmath.p  pThe definition of that compiler flag isp  blockquote   pSets the optimization options clfinitemathonly and   clunsafemathoptimizations.     This allows optimizations for floatingpoint arithmetic that may violate the IEEE 754     standard   and the OpenCL numerical compliance requirements defined in in section   7.4     for singleprecision floatingpoint, section 9.3.9 for doubleprecision floating     point, and edge case behavior in   section 7.5. This option causes the preprocessor macrobr   strongFASTRELAXEDMATHstrong to be defined in the OpenCL program.p blockquote  pIn my program I dont basically care about the exact IEEE compliance. However in Intel integrated GPU this flag causes all of the trigonometric functions to use their own native implementation. In case of halfsin 10 bits of precision according to spec it doesnt really matter. As in the worst case the output still has maybe 8 bits, so 2 bits of less precision than what the spec requires is not too bad.p  pHowever Intel GPU implementation their CPU works fine also replaces the calls to sin. Causing loss of up to 11 bits of precision. Way over half gets thrown away 19 bits is required for sin. I personally dont consider that as an expected behaviour anymore, and it makes software development bit hard when the only options are to either demand strict IEEE compliance or abandon majority of usable precision in normal builtin functions. p  pI am aware that strictly speaking they are following the spec. The compiler flag allows them to break the numerical compliance requirements in the section that defines the usable accuracy of builtin functions. However even the mildest flag that allows the compiler to ignore NaNs basically allows the total disregard of all builtin function accuracy.p  pThe closest analog to C world is GCC flag Ffastmath, it allows the compiler to do the same, but yet in their case the normal math lib functions still remain usable even if they do assume floating point math is associative etc.p  pI would like to know how in general these sort of precision requirements are handled. Is Intel actually following the spirit of the spec Does anyone know how to allow Intel GPU to optimize kernels to its hearts content such as assuming floating point math is associative without unreasonably ruining the precision of builtin functionsp

Negative 3822 pHello fellow WT users. I have a problem with enabling the user the ability to choose a save location for some data in my application. I have noticed that WT has an absence of an easy to use saveopen file dialog boxes or widgets for the purposes of browsing the hard drive of a machine for a save location or a file to load. I would imagine both of such widgets return the path of said location or file to load, but alas I have not found any. I have also looked at a hrefhttpwww.webtoolkit.euwtdocreferencehtmlclassWt11WFileUpload.html relnofollowWtWFileUpload Classa but had a hard time understanding how exactly to use it, and after googling around some examples determined it is probably not what I am looking for.p  pWhy not use windows OpenFileDialog Well, in this project I have WT overlayed over a full screen application as a UI, if any other windows open the application would minimizewhich is bad. Which is why Im looking to browse the hard drive in just WT.p  pAfter thinking about this for a while, I figured why not just write my own file browser So after a bit of digging I came across the a hrefhttpwww.webtoolkit.euwidgetstreestablesmvctreeviews relnofollowMVC Tree Viewsa. Those look pretty close to a hrefhttpswww.google.comsearchqwindowsopenfiledialogampespv210ampessm122ampsourcelnmsamptbmischampsaXampeiMmiWUuX4BpWosQSfy4CgCQampved0CAkQAUoAQampbiw1137ampbih622essm122ampespv210ampqwindows7savefiledialogampspell1amptbmischampimgdii relnofollowWindows Open File Dialoga, except that I would need to write my own code for building and displaying the trees, browsing the hard drive with boost, then handling all the saving and loading myself.p  pWhich I am not apposed to, it just seemed reasonable to check with the community before I jump the gun and write a lot of code that I potentially might not need to. It seems odd that WT does not have anything to support hard drive browsing, which brings me here.p  pDoes anyone know anything about a Widget, or a clever combination of Widgets, or another WT method to enable the user to browse the hard drive of the machine in just WTp  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 3822 pI am new to professional development of UI application. I wonder what the normal approach to decide the layout of the each UI element.  Do people hardcode the size elements according to the design time monitor size And later scale the UI size dynamically Or do people use some dynamical approach to set each UI element proportional according to screen size I meant if theres a method dynamically to set controls size proportional to screen size and that ratio is hardcoded by programmer. Obviously, Dockpanel or viewbox are automatic adjusting. Or do people usually decided size upon design time Or therere other common approach p

Safari 5.1 doesnt support the most recent syntax of flexbox. p  pIs there an easy way to test this locally on Windows 8.x or must I get my hands on a iOSdevice for local testing or put the new design live so I can test it on various testing sitesp
Negative 3822 pAlright so Im using a cell reuse identifier to generate codeUITableViewCellscode on my table view. This codeUITableViewcode displays all of your contacts first and last names, first by grabbing them through codeABAddressBookcode and then using the data in codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode like thisp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      static NSString CellIdentifier  inviteCell     UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]      forIndexPathindexPath] taken from above      iftableView  self.tableView              configure the cells for the contacts tableView         define CHECKNULLSTRINGstr [str isKindOfClass[NSNull class]]  strstr          id p[contactsObjects objectAtIndexindexPath.row]         NSString fNamebridge NSString ABRecordCopyValuebridge ABRecordRefp, kABPersonSortByFirstName         NSString lNamebridge NSString ABRecordCopyValuebridge ABRecordRefp, kABPersonSortByLastName         cell.textLabel.text[NSString stringWithFormat ,CHECKNULLSTRINGfName,CHECKNULLSTRINGlName]          else              configure the cells for the search bar controllers tableView.          define CHECKNULLSTRINGstr [str isKindOfClass[NSNull class]]  strstr          id p[searchResults objectAtIndexindexPath.row]         NSString fNamebridge NSString ABRecordCopyValuebridge ABRecordRefp, kABPersonSortByFirstName         NSString lNamebridge NSString ABRecordCopyValuebridge ABRecordRefp, kABPersonSortByLastName         cell.textLabel.text[NSString stringWithFormat ,CHECKNULLSTRINGfName,CHECKNULLSTRINGlName]            return cell   codepre  pstrongWhat I need to do isstrong, select any of the cells generated like this, and also be able to deselect any of the cells. In the background, Ill be using the phone numbers associated with each name to check if theyre registered in my database. But as for this codeUITableViewcode I need to select any of the table cells, and strongnotstrong also select every 10th cell, or whatever it is.p  pemPut clearlyem I need to keep track of what cells are checked, and I need to do this using minimal code. I may be wrong, but I believe in my case, I MUST USE cell reuse identifiers, and the cells must me singleselected and unselectable. How do I do thisp
Negative 3822 pIm attempting to use the less mixins that come with Bootstrap 3 to create more symantic code.p  pHeres my setup.

Simple enough.   p  pWith only one instance of the application running and up to 70 simultaneous threads, the app will run up the CPU to over 150.. and have trouble keeping up processing the incoming data.  This is running on a Dell 24 Core System.p  pNow if I create 3 instances of my application, and split the incoming data across the 3 instances on the same machine, the max overall cpu on the same machine may only reach 25.   p  pQuestion is why would one instance of the application use 6 times the amount of CPU that 3 instances on the same machine each processing one third of the amount of data usep  pIm not a linux guy, but can anyone recommend a tool to monitor system resources to try and figure out where the bottleneck is occurring Any clues as to why 3 instances processing the same amount of data as 1 instance would use so much less overall system CPUp

Negative 3822 pI am trying to understand the internal working behind GDB commands. After initial homework of understanding about elf  shared libraries  address space randomization, I attempted to understand how GDB make sense between the executable and corefile.p  psolib.c contains the implementation of shared library processing. Esp am interested in the info sharedlibrary command.p  pThe comment on the solib.c goes like this..p  pre code   Relocate the section binding addresses as recorded in the shared  objects file by the base address to which the object was actually  mapped.     opsrelocatesectionaddresses so, p   code pre  pI could not understand much from this comment. Can somebody explain me in plain english how relocation happens i.e Every time when an executable loads a shared object, it is going to load at some location say X, and all the symbols inside the shared library will be located at fixed offset, say XY with some size Z. My question is, how does gdb does the same range of address relocation, so that it matches with the load segments in the corefile. How it takes that hint from executable. p

Negative 3822 pI came here for an answer of question which keeps me busy for a longer time.p  pFor clarity, this is what I am doingp  pI am creating a java program, which keeps an eye on datas in PLC in form of Graph. Being more specific, I am running a single Timer with TimerTask, which keeps loading data from that PLC every period. But here comes the main problem  a single variable readed from data block takes about 250ms. I want to read more variables at the same time. So basically, it takes variables250ms in time. I think that threading here would be absolutely necessary to achieve dreamed goals. p  pCome little more deeper into the codep  pFrom the beginning. I am starting a Timer as thisp  precodeTimer timer  new Timer timer.scheduledc, 0, period codepre  pWhere the dc is instance of a DataCollector class, which gets the data from PLC. A vital fragment of method run in DataCollector is like thisp  precodeOverride public void run      variables  readFromPlc codepre  pAnd here comes the problem I am standing at. readFromPlc calls read from another class called TCP. In that class, I am creating as many threads as are variables. But the problem is how to keep those threads running in period of time. I create those Threads in constructor and at the first time, they of course call run and properly read datas from plc and show them to a graph. But thats end of those threads  run wont be called again. p  pIf i could stop and continue threads repeatedly, that would be great. But I am structed here.  PS I cant simple make a new instance of TCP, because I have some other methods and functional code there which I dont want to run again.p  pOR very simplyfied I want to run threads run method every period of time f.e. every second.p  pI would appreciate any help.p  pThanks, Michael p

Negative 3822 pMy objective is to show dealer locations in two different ways a map and a tableview.p  pI have a container view controller DealersViewController which contains two child view controllers DealersMapViewController and DealersListViewController. The user can switch between the VCs with a UISegmentedControl placed on the navigation bar. Tapping on a map annotation or a tableview cell will push a DealersDetailViewController.p  pThe switching is already implemented using code from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11422845changingviewcontrollerwhensegmentedcontrolchangesChanging view controller when Segmented Control changesa and seems to work fine, as does the pushing of the detail.p  pWhat I would like to improve is the flow of data between container and children. The dealer locations are downloaded JSON from the internet in the parent and on completion an NSArray locations property is set on both the map VC and the list VC. This array will contain dictionary objects created automatically by AFNetworking, each with location data each location dictionary will have a title, subtitle, latitude, longitude to conform to MKAnnotation protocol, but also other things like image and description etc.p  pMy question is How can I be sure that the container VC and both child VCs agree on how location data is structured Theoretically, if someone wanted to develop another child view controller to add to my container that shows dealer locations in a collection view for example, how can he formally know how to expect data. Apple says If the container needs the child to declare methods or properties, it should define a protocol to enforce this.  I could force the children to declare the locations property but the array could contain anything p  pMaybe the parent could be a datasource for the children I havent tried this approach yet.p  pI am probably overcomplicating things but my objective is also to learn how to properly create reusable components and also practice using stuff like custom protocols  delegates and design patterns in general.p  pThanks.p

See the mockup here a hrefhttpcodepen.iojphoganpenjaItL relnofollowhttpcodepen.iojphoganpenjaItLap  pThe wide, right text is a tablecell element.

Negative 3822 pIm building a realtime graphing multithreaded QT C application using qcustomplot.h that uses signals and slots for various updates to the graphs. Additionally, OpenCV is being used in the main processing thread to generate the data.p  pIt seems like Im encountering some strange concurrency issues At various times while running the program sometimes relatively early, sometimes not until over 10 minutes of running, I get an exception that I cant get much out of.p  pUnhandled exception at 0x000007FEDCD7FA8C Qt5Gui.dll in VitalsOneProj.exe 0xC0000005 Access violation writing location 0x00000000000002B8.p  pThe stacktrace points to tmainCRTStartup and then buries deep into Qt5Widgets.dll and Qt5Gui.dll p  pI have encountered this error with varying frequency throughout development. I have boost mutexes in both the qt mainwindow as well as in the adapter connecting the processing to the GUI. Adding the latter mutexes seemed to decrease the frequency, but the exceptions still occur. I feel that the exception may be coming from QT making an asynchronous call which then releases its lock and allows another call to collide and corrupt memory. p  pAny ideas on how to fix this problemp  pSolution I fixed it by no longer releasing locks in functions that called replot. Since replot is asynchronous, collisions can occur in future GUI calls. I moved the unlocking of my mutexes to the afterReplot callback function to avoid these collisions and I no longer get an exception.p
Negative 3822 pSo the assignment is the following fictional story For Nelson Mandelas funeral, people could pay their last respects to him at a building.

Because of security measures no dignitaries may enter if there are civilians inside. When one or more Dignitaries are entering the queue no new Burgers may enter the building and every waiting Dignitary are allowed access when the last civilian has left the building. li liDignitaries may enter any time there are other Dignitaries inside and no waiting civilians outside.li liTo prevent civilians will have a chance to pay their last respects as well, as soon as a civilian has entered the queue a maximum of 5 Dignitaries may enter the building. After which 100 civilians may enter the building and will have priority above Dignitaries. li liBurgers may always enter when there are no Dignitaries waiting or inside. li ul  pI have the following code, but I keep getting stuck after a few rotations and it enters a deadlock, or it just doesnt work properly. strongEdit The problem is the following After a few runs the consecutiveDignitary counter doesnt reset and no new people waiting in line will enter the building because a deadlock has occured somewhere, but I dont see where.

Negative 3822 pIm completely redesigning my companys databases, backend and frontend. One thing Ive seen discussed online quite often is defining the relationships between tables using a primary key, clustered indexes, nonclustered indexes, etc.p  pIn terms of performance, Ive been debating how to best setup the structure for a couple of my tables. Within several of the tables, there is a location field. In the current setup, users manually enter the location, something similar to C1.H39.3. Where C1 denotes the building, .H is the letter, 39 is the number, and .3 is the tile. p  pMy question is how should I link my location table to my other tables. The location table is setup with ID identity, building, letter, number, and tile columns. When creating my relationships, would it be better to merely have a column for the id, or should I composite the columns together What would be more beneficial to performancep

Negative 3822 pIm working on an android app using libgdx, and Im trying to draw some type of wind particles that leave a trail behind, something similar to  this a hrefhttphint.fmwind relnofollowhttphint.fmwinda. p  pIve managed to draw the particles, which are lines that connect the previous position to the newest. However, if I clean the screen every time, it will only draw the current positions, which will be similar to little dots moving, as expected. p  pWhat I want to do is to draw a trail behind those particles, that fades away. To do this, I tried creating a list of the previous particle positions and drawing them with a decreasing alpha, but there are to many particles to draw and it proved to be very slow.

Negative 3822 pI am using biblatex with bibtex in backend MikTex for generating dynamic statistical reports with knitr sweave in Rstudio which is realy a great combination of tools.  I have with difficulty created my own bibliography style .bst file with custombib for British Journal of Neurosurgery Unfortunately, .bst files doesnt work with biblatex and custombib is not a very pratical tool. More over knitrRstudio doesnt work with biber. I havent try to create manually my own style as it seems quite complicated. I will have to create more styles for publishing in medicals journals which have often their own bibliography style.p  pMy Questions are  How can I easily create or customize bibliography styles for to use with  biblatexRstudioknitrSweave  I have briefly and unsuccessfully try with Jabref, Bibit.

I search extensively the web without finding THE solution. Any clue  Thanks   p

I have 4GB of ram, and the program needs to run on budget machines, meaning 24 gigs. Ive been using a color depth of 8 I imagine Im wasting about 34 of my memory realistically Im saving the surface as a .bmp file, which is supposed to support a blackwhite format where bpp  1.p  pIs there any way to lower the bpp in SDL or should I look for an alternativep  hr  p6514p  pI hit a bottleneck on my machine at about 39000x39000 pixels at a color depth of 8 bits. Because SDL stores surfaces in physical memory, Im running out of RAM. Processing power is not an issue as Im rendering a still image. Im hoping to double that resolution, but Ill take what I can get. Yes I can potentially split the image into multiple files, but because it will be highres laser printed at a later date, it will have to be open as a single file then anyways. The goal is to package the program as a single unit, not requiring additional steps to stitch and convert the images later in another program.p  pSDL and c in general dont seem to have support for single bit variables bool not included, so assigning a color value to a 1 bpp pixel using SDL is beyond me.p

This is why I use codey  2xcode and codey  2x  1code. The problem is when codexcode exceeds the highest value for codeycode. So if the Array has 8 images code[0  7]code, it will loop through the cell draw process 8 times, if I draw two at once it will draw the 8th image on the 3rd loop code0[0,1]  1[2,3]  2[4,5]  3[6,7]code The error will come up on the 4th loop code4[8,9]code index 8 beyond bounds 7. Is there an exception I can write to avoid this Or am I using an incorrect thought process that should be handled differentlyp  pHow can I make it so that once I do put two images in the same row, each one will have their own onclick event handler and redirect to their own unique page right now the call is on the table cell view, so that when I click either image in the same row, the page will redirect to the same one.p  pMy restrictions are I need to pull the data as I am from a mysql database through a php page. The number of images that will be pulled will be random.

Negative 3822 pIve got an application which gets some results from some urls and then has to take a decision based on the results i.e. pick the best result and display it to the user. Since I want to check several urls this was the first time that multithreading is pretty much needed.p  pSo with the help of some examples I cooked up the following testcodep  precodeimport threading import urllib2  threadsList  [] theResultList  []  def geturlurl     result  urllib2.urlopenurl.read     theResultList.appendresult[010]  theUrls  [httpgoogle.com,  httpyahoo.com]  for u in theUrls     t  threading.Threadtargetgeturl, argsu,     threadsList.appendt     t.start     t.join  print theResultList codepre  pThis seems to work, but Im really insecure here because I really have virtually no experience with multithreading. I always hear these terms like thread safe and race condition. p  pOf course I read about these things, but since this is my first time using something like this, my question is is it ok to do it like this Are there any negative or unexpected effects which I overlook Are there ways to improve thisp  pAll tips are welcomep

Negative 3822 pIm currently looking for a solution that will prevent a user from making multiple requests at the same time. I would like the first request to finish before the I process the second request from the user. For example, lets say user adam liked and unliked suzys photo. Both unliking and liking of the photo happens in the same view. p  pCurrently the problem that Ive been having is that Im processing both requests at the same time. In the case of the like view, when a user likes something, I create a likeobject. When the user decides to unlike something, I check for the existence of the likeobject in the database and then delete it. HOWEVER If the first request hasnt finished yet, the check for the likeobject in the second request will come back saying there is no like object and it will create a second likeobject.p  pOnce all of this is finished processing, I will end up having 2 likeobjects for the same photo from the same user. This is bad.p  pTo give you more information, I use Gunicorn as my HTTP server. I run 3 regular workers, which is why each request is processed at the same time. p  pSo what do you think I could do I mean, I was thinking for using Celery and RabbitMQ for this. Each request will be submitted into a queue and be processed asynchronously. Thats one option. But I feel like that might be overkill in a situation like this. Im looking for something that can be done directly within Django. Hmm, let me know of the possible solutions. p  pThanks p

I am using MacTeX 2014. Neither of these solutions seemed to work.p  pAt this point, having looked over SO and some other message boards, I am aware of only two optionsp  ol liSwitch to an alternate TeX interpreter, such as LuaTeX, which will allow me to use more memory, orli liUse the native R plot, and then manually superimpose the desired labels onto the figures.li ol  pI consider 1 to be an acceptable solution, but the fact that I would need an alternate product makes me wonder if I am missing something. I wonder if there is a way to render complex native R plots, which happen to have TeXstyle labels in them.p

Obviously my page structure isnt really having the desired effect. I wanted to differentiate the codeltheadergtcode and codeltfootergtcode from the codeltmaingtcode page content. I understand these tags are not sectioning elements as such, but if not, then what are they for, especially in the case of codeltheadergtcode and codeltfootergtcode My understanding was that codeltmaingtcode should be used where you might have used codeltdiv idmaingtcode or codeltdiv idwrappergtcode in the past and should denote the main area of the page, which is exactly what its doing.p  pThe reason I havent used codeltsectiongtcode tags is because I understand that they shouldnt be used as styling wrappers, and are more for chapters of a page. This page doesnt have any chapters the only selfcontained things are already differentiated with codeltarticlegtcode and codeltasidegtcode so I didnt see why I should use codeltsectiongtcode.p  pI also tried using codelth1gtcode tags in codeltheadergtcode and codeltfootergtcode which seems to sort out my problem. p  precodeltheadergt     lth1gtSite titlelth1gt     ltnavgt         ltulgt             ltligtlist 1ltligt             ltligtlist 2ltligt         ltulgt     ltnavgt ltheadergt ltmaingt     lth1gtMain page headinglth1gt     ltarticlegtlth1gtPost 1lth1gtltarticlegt     ltarticlegtlth1gtPost 2lth1gtltarticlegt     ltdiv idsidebargt         ltasidegtlth1gtAside headinglth1gtltasidegt     ltdivgt ltmaingt ltfootergt     lth1gtFooter headinglth1gt     ltasidegtlth1gtFooter widget headinglth1gtltasidegt     ltasidegtlth1gtFooter widget headinglth1gtltasidegt ltfootergt codepre  pOutlinep  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode1.

Negative 3822 pGenerally, all native libraries built for release version are stripped that are used in Android Application. Suppose we now get a crash from an App downloaded from Playstore and we get the backtrace from log cat using adb.

Is there any alternative to get the correct backtrace even if the library is stripped and built for release versionp  pI knw there are couple of options provide at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions601503howdoiobtaincrashdatafrommyandroidapplicationHow do I obtain crashdata from my Android applicationa , but my question is more towards getting stack trace from stripped libraries.

Im interested in getting the elements actual areas that are visible.p  precodefunction getVisibleArease      ...     return rectangleSet  codepre  pPutting it more formally  the emvisible areasem of elements is the set of preferably nonoverlapping rectangles in CSS coordinates for which a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPIdocument.elementFromPointcodeelementFromPointx, ycodea will return the element if the point x, y is contained in at least one of the rectangles in the set.p  pThe outcome of calling this function on all DOM elements including iframes should be a set of nonoverlapping area sets which union is the entire viewport area.p  pMy goal is to create some kind of a viewport dump data structure, which can efficiently return a single element for a given point in the viewport, and vice versa  for a given element in the dump, it will return the set of visible areas. The data structure will be passed to a remote client application, so I will not necessarily have access to the actual document when I need to query the viewport structure.p  pImplementation requirements liObviously, the implementation should consider elements codehiddencode state, codezindexcode, header amp footer etc. liI am looking for an implementation that works in all common used browsers, especially mobile  Androids Chrome and iOSs Safari. liPreferably doesnt use external libraries.p  pOf course, I could be nave and call codeelementFromPointcode for every discrete point in the viewport, But performance is crucial since I iterate over all of the elements, and will do it quite often.p  pPlease direct me as to how I can achieve this goal.p  pstrongDisclaimerstrong Im pretty noob to web programming concepts, so I might have used wrong technical terms.p  pstrongProgressstrongp  pI came up with an implementation. The algorithm is pretty simplep  ol li Iterate over all elements, and add their vertical  horizontal lines to a coordinates map if the coordinate is within the viewport. li Call document.elementFromPoint for each rectangle center position. A rectangle is an area between two consecutive vertical and two consecutive horizontal coordinates in the map from step 1. ol  pThis produces a set of areas  rectangles, each pointing to a single element.p  pThe problems with my implementation arep  ol li It is inefficient for complicated pages can take up to 24 minutes for a really big screen and gmail inbox. li It produces a large amount of rectangles per a single element, which makes it inefficient to stringify and send over a network, and also inconvenient to work with I would want to end up with a set with as few rectangles as possible per element. ol  pAs much as I can tell, the codeelementFromPointcode call is the one that takes a lot of time and causes my algorithm to be relatively useless...p  pCan anyone suggest a better approachp  pHere is my implementationp  precodefunction AreaPortionl, t, r, b, currentDoc      if currentDoc currentDoc  document     this.x  l     this.y  t     this.r  r     this.b  b     this.w  r  l     this.h  b  t      center  this.getCenter     this.elem  currentDoc.elementFromPointcenter[0], center[1]   AreaPortion.prototype       getName function          return [x  this.x  ,y  this.y  ,w  this.w  ,h  this.h  ]     ,      getCenter function          return [this.x  this.w  2, this.y  this.h  2]        function getViewport      var viewPortWidth     var viewPortHeight       IE6 in standards compliant mode i.e. with a valid doctype as the first line in the document     if              typeof document.documentElement  undefined ampamp             typeof document.documentElement.clientWidth  undefined ampamp             document.documentElement.clientWidth  0          viewPortWidth  document.documentElement.clientWidth,         viewPortHeight  document.documentElement.clientHeight            the more standards compliant browsers mozillanetscapeoperaIE7 use window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight     else if typeof window.innerWidth  undefined          viewPortWidth  window.innerWidth,         viewPortHeight  window.innerHeight            older versions of IE     else          viewPortWidth  document.getElementsByTagNamebody[0].clientWidth,         viewPortHeight  document.getElementsByTagNamebody[0].clientHeight           return [viewPortWidth, viewPortHeight]   function getLines      var onScreen  []     var viewPort  getViewport      TODO header amp footer     var all  document.getElementsByTagName      var vert       var horz        vert[0]  0     vert[  viewPort[1]]  viewPort[1]     horz[0]  0     horz[  viewPort[0]]  viewPort[0]     for i  0  i lt all.length  i          var e  all[i]          TODO Get all client rectangles         var rect  e.getBoundingClientRect         if rect.width lt 1 ampamp rect.height lt 1 continue          var left  Math.floorrect.left         var top  Math.floorrect.top         var right  Math.floorrect.right         var bottom  Math.floorrect.bottom          if top gt 0 ampamp top lt viewPort[1]              vert[  top]  top                  if bottom gt 0 ampamp bottom lt viewPort[1]              vert[  bottom]  bottom                  if right gt 0 ampamp right lt viewPort[0]              horz[  right]  right                  if left gt 0 ampamp left lt viewPort[0]              horz[  left]  left                    hCoords  []     vCoords  []     TODO      for var v in vert          vCoords.pushvert[v]           for var h in horz          hCoords.pushhorz[h]           return [hCoords, vCoords]   function getAreaPortions      var portions       var lines  getLines      var hCoords  lines[0]     var vCoords  lines[1]      for i  1  i lt hCoords.length  i          for j  1  j lt vCoords.length  j              var portion  new AreaPortionhCoords[i  1], vCoords[j  1], hCoords[i], vCoords[j]             portions[portion.getName]  portion                    return portions  codepre

What is the most simple way to secure this Is oAuth worth it or can I make a simpler, handmade encryption system with a private key only my app and my API would know and that I would simply add in the POSTp

It doesnt really matter what is made visible in the COM visible DLL as its for purely internal use. All of it could, and probably would be best if it was.

Negative 3822 pIve got a C library that Ive written a lot of unit tests for. The library is a data access layer library and requires SQL Servers fulltext indexing capabilities, which means LocalDb will not work. The unit tests are connecting to a local SQL Server instance. The project has an codeIDatabaseInitializercode that drops and recreates the database for each test, so each test has a fresh set of data to assume it can work against, meaning each test is capable of running on its own  no ordering needed.p  pA problem that Ive had since day one on this, but never tackled yet, is that if I simply run all of the tests at once, some will fail. If I go back and run those tests individually then they succeed. Its not always the same tests that fail when I run all at once.p  pIve assumed that this is because theyre all running so quickly and against the same database. Perhaps the database is not properly deleting and recreating before the next test runs. On top of just a simple database, Ive also got a SQL Server fulltext index that some of my tests require in order to pass. The fulltext index populates in the background and therefore is not ready immediately after populating the test databases tables. The fulltext index may take a second or two to build. This causes my tests that target the fulltext index to always fail, unless I step through the initializer in a debugger and pause a few seconds while the fulltext index builds.p  pMy question is, is there any way to avoid this clashing of database rebuilds As a bonus, is there a way to slow down the tests that need the fulltext index, so that it has time to populatep

Negative 3822 pSo I have an android base project that I want to split into various flavors. Assigning seperate xmls is easy enough, and so is classes. However the problem arises when there are calls from the base classes to the flavor classes. Say for instance I havep  precodepackage app.myapp.service  import app.flavor1.ClassB import app.flavor2.ClassB import app.flavor3.ClassB import app.flavor4.ClassB  public class Class A      Class B bar  new Class B      bar.foo  codepre  pSo depending on the flavor build I still want to use the Class B implementation of it, however I cannot import both classes as each specific flavor wont recognise an import that is not in that project structure. Thus, on build of the project it will throw an error as that import is not recognised. If it were only two flavors I may be able to do a buildconfig to fix it however if the flavors become 2 it becomes a problem. How would I fix this Or maybe put differently can I still import multiple flavors from my base classes Thanksp

Negative 3822 pIs there a way to make IIS 8 to download files from a remote location For example I have a download link codelta hreffileserver.comdownloadsetup.exegtcodep  pCurrently I would have to right click and Copy Link Location to access the file. Is there a way to have IIS 8 to allow this file to be automatically downloadedrun in users browsersp  pThis might not make any difference, but when clicking the file link from the web server, I get the following error You are attempting to download a file from a site that is not part of your Trusted Sites and that might be different from website you are viewing.p  pI looked around and couldnt find something exactly like this.

Negative 3822 pIm using angular and bootstrapui.  I have two columns beside each other, the right one has a larger height then the the left due to the presence of controls.  All I want to do is add some text in the right column that is aligned with the bottom of the left column, which should be easy.  I will not admit how long I struggled with it.p  pIt looks like the problem is that the left column itself is top aligned.  so I have something like thisp  precode                  col 1  col 2                                      codepre  pI would like to cause col 1 to align with the bottom of col 2 within the row.  From there aligning text in col 1 with the bottom of the col should be easy.p  pIve found many supposed solutions, but they dont seem to work.  The most common involve overriding the display and verticalalign properties of the CSS, but doing this seems to screw up the rows alignment in odd ways.  Ive seen col 1 end up after col 2 or the row shrinking to not use its full width of the page.  The point being my attempts to override elements are messing with bootstrap.  I believe this is because most suggestions are not actually for angular and bootstrapui.p  pThe closest I got to something working was setting displayfluid for the row.  This got the columns to be the same size without interfering with the rest of the look and feel.

Negative 3822 pI have an MVC application that I recently converted the authenticationauthorization method from forms to federated.  Everything works fine, but on the home page I have to create a cookie for the authorization of the rest of my site to work properly.  When users navigate to the home page first it works great, if they navigate to a different page first where authorization is required they get a 401 unauthorized error page.p  pWhen I had the forms authentication implemented it would redirect users that were unauthorized to the login page, with federation I no longer have a login page so I would like to redirect to the home page.  With forms authentication the redirection was automatic, how would I setup something similar for my federated applicationp  pHere are the federated portions of my web.config that are relevant.

Negative 3822 pI get this error when trying to access localhost via a browser.p  blockquote   p403 Forbiddenp blockquote  pI use Ubuntu 14.04 LTSp  pHere is my configuration filep  petcapache2.confp  pre       This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the      configuration directives that give the server its instructions.      See httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4 for detailed information about      the directives and usrsharedocapache2README.Debian about Debian specific      hints.                Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian      The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to      upstreams suggested way to configure the web server. This is because DebiansA      default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,      virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in      order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as      possible.       It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined      below, all located in the etcapache2 directory             etcapache2         apache2.conf             ports.conf         modsenabled            .load            .conf         confenabled            .conf         sitesenabled             .conf                 apache2.conf is the main configuration file this file. It puts the pieces        together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the        web server.            ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is        supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be        customized anytime.            Configuration files in the modsenabled, confenabled and sitesenabled        directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,        global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,        respectively.             They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their        respective available counterparts. These should be managed by using our        helpers a2enmoda2dismod, a2ensitea2dissite and a2enconfa2disconf. See        their respective man pages for detailed information.            The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in        the default configuration, apache2 needs to be startedstopped with        etcinit.dapache2 or apache2ctl. Calling usrbinapache2 directly will not        work with the default configuration.        Global configuration                 ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers      configuration, error, and log files are kept.           NOTE  If you intend to place this on an NFS or otherwise network      mounted filesystem then please read the Mutex documentation available      at       you will save yourself a lot of trouble.

These categories are ordinal, as well, which Im not sure if it makes a difference. p  pI thought about logistic regression for the bounds on the 0,1 interval, but that didnt make sense because thats determining the probability of a binary variable.

I think this reattaching is the problem gdb debugging in linux seems like this but due to not having symbols on the Xojos framework Im not so sure.p  pThis are the two methodsfunctions used for detaching and reattachingp  precodevoid ReattachCurrentThreadvoid token      static void pAttachThreadvoid  nullptr     if pAttachThread         pAttachThread  void void  gResolverUnsafeAttachCurrentThread     if pAttachThread pAttachThread token    void  DetachCurrentThreadvoid      static void  pDetachThreadvoid  nullptr     if pDetachThread         pDetachThread  void  void gResolverUnsafeDetachCurrentThread     if pDetachThread return pDetachThread     return nullptr  codepre  pAnd here is one place where those are calledp  precodeREALdbCursor MySQLPerformSelectMySQLDatabaseData db, REALstring queryStr      if dbgtfConnection  nullptr return nullptr      if LockDatabaseUsage db  return nullptr      REALstringData stringData     if REALGetStringData queryStr, REALGetStringEncoding queryStr , ampstringData  return nullptr      void detachToken  DetachCurrentThread     int err  mysqlrealquery dbgtfConnection, const char stringData.data, stringData.length      ReattachCurrentThread detachToken      dbgtCaptureLastError      REALDisposeStringData ampstringData       REALdbCursor retCursor  nullptr     if 0  err           Allocate a cursor         MySQLCursorData curs  new MySQLCursorData         bzero curs, sizeof MySQLCursorData            cursgtfCursor  new MySQLCursor db           retCursor  NewDBCursor curs            UnlockDatabaseUsage db       return retCursor  codepre  pMy question is is there anything wrong with strongthe code abovestrong and is it expected to cause a segfault because its not being careful somehow etc Im not a C programmer but it seems too embluntem in my understanding, like not trying to see if thread is available first etc. Again, Im not a C programmer so all Im saying may be absurd etc...p  pThe whole plugins code is here a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsh3wycng6yd3617etAABPT3yugEsbaPgas1UBQqadl0plugins sourceap
Negative 3822 pI want to do an ngrepeat in the codeltheadgtcode of a page in order to enumerate open graph meta tags.  However, Im not sure how to accomplish as it seems that tags allowed in codeltheadgtcode are containing tags.p  pIf I simply add a codeltdivgtcode wrapper like I often do with ngrepeat, browsers bump it down from the codeltheadgtcode down into codeltbodygtcode.p  pI have considered creating my own donothing directive to allow me to do something like thisp  precodeltcustomrepeatwrapper ngrepeatentry in entriesgt   ltmeta propertyentry.key contententry.contentgt ltcustomrepeatwrappergt codepre  pI presume that would work, but for all I know, browsers might bump it down to codeltbodygtcode as well.p  pI guess I could potentially write my own directive that sorta works like ngrepeat, but doesnt require a wrapper, and instead duplicates the tag it is placed on. p  pAnyone have any other suggestions for a cleaner solution before I head down this pathp

Negative 3822 pThis is a question about a sensible approach for managing interstore dependencies.  I have an app which provides various dashboards for parts of a system.  Each part of the system has a dedicated controllerview and store.  p  pIm now working on an overall dashboard which will represent a toplevel summary of the dashboard data exposed by each existing store.  Given that theres a fair amount of transformation in each store, I want to have my new codeSummaryStorecode depend upon each of the existing stores and pull data from each.  Nice and DRY.p  pThe system has a very high throughput of data.  Each dedicated store, when it receives an action from the dispatcher, will determine whether the action mutates the state for that particular store it often doesnt and only call codeemitChangecode if it does.  This minimises the amount of rerendering the UI does.p  pI want to preserve that only emit change if you have to approach with the summary store.  How to sensibly achieve thisp  pAt present I have a number of alternativesp  ol liExpose a property on called codehasChangedcode on each of my existing stores which is true when that stores state has been mutated and false otherwise.  Use codewaitForcode in my codeSummaryStorecode, listening to the same events as the dedicated store and only triggering codeemitChangecode if codehasChangedcode on a dedicated store is codetruecodeli ol  pThis approach seems fairly reasonable and pragmatic. The downside as I see it is having this store effectively know what actions each of the other stores will respond to and reimplementing that in the codeSummaryStorecode so we are granular in our codewaitForcodes.  Thats not so bad though.  I also note that this exact same approach appears to have been used in the official FluxUtils codeFluxStorecode  a hrefhttpfacebook.github.iofluxdocsfluxutils.htmlapi relnofollowhttpfacebook.github.iofluxdocsfluxutils.htmlapiap  ol start2 liHave the codeSummaryStorecode listen to the codeemitChangecode of each dedicated store and only change state  codeemitChangecode in the codeSummaryStorecode in those callbacks.  You could potentially even bin the Dispatcher registration too.  Controversialli ol  pThis has the potential to make things rather nondeterministic since the mutation would take place when the codeemitChangecode came from the dedicated store.  Sure, you could still use codewaitForcode if you kept the Dispatcher registration but Im unclear as to whether that would give you back the determinism you desire and it might make for an unclear architecture. Ive done some digging and seen no evidence of anyone else having stores listen to stores.  That rather sets alarm bells off for me  but perhaps thats irrational.p  ol start3 liHave each store raise an action in the event of a state change.  The codeSummaryStorecode would not subscribe to the same messages as the dedicated stores but only to the actions raised by the dedicated stores.li ol  pThis uses the dispatcher mechanism quite nicely and unless Im missing something removes the need for duplicating the message subscription code of each of the dedicated stores in the codeSummaryStorecode.  No need for codewaitForcode all that jazz, just have it respond to the actions dispatched by each store.  The only thing that gives me pause for thought isp  hr  pThe question is, which of these is most the Flux way  p
Negative 3822 pIve wondered about this for a very long time.p  pI understand that GUI programming is eventdriven. I understand that most GUI programms will feature an event loop which loops through all events on the message queue. I also understand that it does so by calling some kind of Operating System method like getmessage, which will block the thread until a message is received. In this sense, when no events are happening, the thread is sleeping peacefully.p  pMy question, however, is how does the Operating System check for available messagesSomewhere down the stack I assume there must be a loop which is continually checking for new events. Such a loop cannot possibly feature any blocking, because if so, there must be another looping thread which is alwaysawake, ready to wake the first. However, I also appreciate that this cannot be true, because otherwise I would expect to see 100 of at least one processor core in use at all times, checking over and over and over and over....p  pI have considered that perhaps the checking thread has a small sleep between each iteration. This would certainly explain why an idle system isnt using 100 CPU. But then I recalled how events are usually responded to immediately. Take a mouse movement for example the cursor is being constantly redrawn, in sync with the physical movements.p  pIs there something fundamental, perhaps, in CPU architectures that allows threads to be woken at the hardware level, when certain memory addresses change valuep  pIm otherwise out of ideas Could anyone please help to explain whats really happeningp

The strange thing is that the same animation works fine if I put it in the first view controller p  pI had this issue in a bigger application, but I was able to reproduce it in a very stupid and simple application with only two viewcontrollers. Here is how I did p  ul liCreate a project with Single View Application main ViewController is named ViewControllerli liCreate source files for second UIViewController named ViewController2li liIn the storyboard, create a viewcontroller, link it to ViewController2li liCreate a button in ViewController and link it to the ViewController2 with a segue whichever typeli ul  pThe code of the animation is basically the full content of my source file the code of ViewController is very similar p  precodeimport ViewController2.h  interface ViewController2   end  implementation ViewController2   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      UIView view  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake200, 200, 100, 100]     view.backgroundColor  [UIColor blueColor]     view.layer.cornerRadius  50      [self.view addSubviewview]      CABasicAnimation scaleAnimation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathtransform.scale]     scaleAnimation.duration  0.2     scaleAnimation.repeatCount  HUGEVAL     scaleAnimation.autoreverses  YES     scaleAnimation.fromValue  [NSNumber numberWithFloat1.2]     scaleAnimation.toValue  [NSNumber numberWithFloat0.8]      [view.layer addAnimationscaleAnimation forKeyscale]     voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning      [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]      Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.    end codepre  pBehavior  animation works fine in ViewController, but when I click the button and go to ViewController2, animation does not start the blue ball is not pulsingp  pAny idea p  pThanksp

Negative 3822 pI just noticed a behavior change that seems related to migrating to iOS 9.p  pI have a codeUITableViewcode. In the first codeUITableViewCellcode I have a codeUIScrollViewcode that I use to page through images. It should only scroll strongleftltrightstrong. Finger dragging up and down should drag the codeUITableViewcode up and down. Up until iOS 9 it did do that beautifully...  Now when I compile for iOS9 devices or simulator I can still scroll the images strongleftltrightstrong but the table no longer scrolls up and down. Those touches just get sucked into the abyss.p  pLet me add that when I compile from Xcode 7 to my device running iOS 8.4 it still behaves as intended. Scrolls up and down when dragging in the embedded codeUIScrollViewcode.p  pFurthermore, when I download my last released version compiled on previously released Xcode for iOS 8.1 target I get the expected behavior on the iOS 9 phone. p  pAdditional wrinkle of weirdness if back in xcode7 compiling live to iOS9 device again I start scrolling vertically from one of the other cells and the table is still gliding to a stop THEN I CAN drag up and down from the codeUIScrollViewcode. What the heckp  pAnything obvious jump out herep  pThanks,p  pBillp

Negative 3822 pSo, having spend many years in an object oriented world with code reuse, design patterns and best practices always taken into account, I find myself struggling somewhat with code organization and code reuse in world of Spark. p  pIf I try to write code in a reusable way, it nearly always comes with a performance cost and I end up rewriting it to whatever is optimal for my particular use case. This constant write what is optimal for this particular use case also affects code organization, because splitting code into different objects or modules is difficult when it all really belongs together and I thus end up with very few God object containing long chains of complex transformations. In fact, I frequently think that if I had taken a look at most of the Spark code Im writing now back when I was working in the object oriented world, I would have winced and dismissed it as spaghetti code. p  pI have surfed the internet trying to find some sort of equivalent to the best practices of the object oriented world, but without much luck. I can find some best practices for functional programming but Spark just adds an extra layer, because performance is such a major factor here. p  pSo my question to you is, have any of you Spark gurus found some best practices for writing Spark code that you can recommendp
