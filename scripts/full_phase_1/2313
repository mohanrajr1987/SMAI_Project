In the first call to codePrintTwoValuescode Im guessing that the return value from codeSomeClass.MyValuecode gets pushed onto the stack.  Then execution continues into codeGetValuecode which just starts the Task and exits.  Then codeDoWorkcode exits and schedules a continuation that will call codePrintTwoValuescode but when that continuation runs the value that had originally gotten pushed on the stack is somehow lost and reverted back to its default value.p  pWhile there are simple ways to workaround this problem, like storing the arguments in temporary variables before passing them to the codePrintTwoValuescode method, Im mostly just curious why this behavior is occurring.p  pNote  Im using Visual Studio 2013, Update 5.  Im building a console application that is targeting .NET Framework 4.5 and running on Windows 10 Enterprise.p

Positive 2313 pThis is for homework, so I dont want to post code or have someone do it for me. Im an intro java student.p  pI created a Parser class that essentially verifies the format for an input. The assignment wants me to accept any number of inputs. I chose to do this with a do while loop. So at the beginning before the loop I declare my variables including Parser parser . Then I proceed into my do while and ask the user for an expression, store it as a string called sentence, and then initialize the parser as parser  new Parsesentence. At the end of the main method I ask the user if they would like to check another sentence to see if its syntactically valid.p  pHowever when I iterate through a second time, obviously I cant initialize this as  new Parse because its not new the second time around But I cant initialize it before the do while loop because otherwise the sentence would be empty. The parser was given to me in pseudocode and I cant change how it functions.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 2313 pIve written some C code that checks whether a device is present on any SerialPort by issuing a command on the port and listening for a reply. When I just set the port speed, open the port, get the serial stream and start processing, it works 100 of the time. However, some of our devices work at different speeds and I am trying to probe for a device at various speeds to autonegotiate a connection as well as detect device presence.p  pWhen I do all this in a single thread there are no problems. However, 3s timeout at ten speeds is 30s per serial port, and there may be several. Hence the desire to probe all ports concurrently.p  pSometimes this works. Sometimes Vista bluescreens.

I looked at the firebug console and it appears that the client does make a get request to httpsservercheckoutpayment.aspx but IIS responds with a 302 to a hrefhttpservercheckoutpayment.aspx relnofollowhttpservercheckoutpayment.aspxa Any clues, as to what could be causing it. Ive even tried forcing SSL for the page, but it doesnt work I get 403.4 error. SSL is required to view this resource. And if i remove the redirection logic and code the payment page to redirect to its SSL version when the connection is not secure using Request.IsSecureConnection, i end up with an endless redirect loop, simply because IIS still wont serve the secure version without a 302. Any ideasp

Negative 2313 pThe company I work for built and hosts a web app used by our customers and I am interested in creating some kind of external monitoring page similar to trust.salesforce.com that users can go to to see the current state of our serversapp. I know there are tons of different monitoring services out there but I want to create the service myself, to have complete control and customization. Obviously, the service would have to be hosted in a different location and data center than the app itself. One thing I am concerned about is that if I just choose a different host in a different location, if that host goes down for any reason power failure, server failure, or even ISP failure the monitoring software is down. For this reason, I am thinking of hosting the monitoring app on an amazon EC2 instance. With their elastic IP feature, if for some reason the data center or point where the instance is running fails, I can just create a duplicate instance with the same data but in a different location and everything would work fine still.p  pDoes this sound like a feasible plan For even more security, I was thinking of creating 2 instances in different locations and monitoring from both of them. If one instance fails, the other would still be up. Obviously, one instance has to act as the actual web host for the monitoring page. Is it possible programatically for one instance to switch the elastic IP over to itself if it detects the other instance has failed for any reasonp  pI know theres a lot of different things involved in this question, Im just looking for feedback regarding ANY of it...p  pIf youve made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read thisp

Negative 2313 pWe have a table set up as followsp  precodeIDEmployeeIDDate     Category       Hours 1 1         112010 Vacation Earned2.0   2 2         2122010Vacation Earned3.0   3 1         242010 Vacation Used  1.0   4 2         5182010Vacation Earned2.0   5 2         7232010Vacation Used  4.0   codepre  pThe business rules arep  ul liVacation balance is calculated by vacation earned minus vacation used.li liVacation used is always applied against the oldest vacation earned amount first.li ul  pWe need to return the rows for Vacation Earned that have not been offset by vacation used.  If vacation used has only offset part of a vacation earned record, we need to return that record showing the difference.  For example, using the above table, the result set would look likep  precodeIDEmployeeIDDate     Category       Hours 1 1         112010 Vacation Earned1.0   4 2         5182010Vacation Earned1.0   codepre  pNote that record 2 was eliminated because it was completely offset by used time, but records 1 and 4 were only partially used, so they were calculated and returned as such.p  pThe only way we have thought of to do this is to get all of the vacation earned records in a temporary table.  Then, get the total vacation used and loop through the temporary table, deleting the oldest record and subtracting that value from the total vacation used until the total vacation used is zero.  We could clean it up for when the remaining vacation used is only part of the oldest vacation earned record.  This would leave us with just the outstanding vacation earned records.p  pThis works, but it is very inefficient and performs poorly.  Also, the performance will just degrade over time as more and more records are added.p  pAre there any suggestions for a better solution, preferable set based  If not, well just have to go with this.p  pEDIT  This is a vendor database.  We cannot modify the table structure in any way.p

I want to write a fixedpoint math library. I read a hrefhttpwww.gameprogrammer.com4fixed.html relnofollowthis articlea, but the accompanying source code is written in 386 assembly, so its neither directly usable nor easily modifiable.p  pThe V810 has builtin integer multiplydivide, but I want to use the 18.14 format mentioned in the above article. This requires dividing a 64bit int by a 32bit int, and the V810 only does signed or unsigned 32bit32bit division which produces a 32bit quotient and a 32bit remainder.p  pSo, my question is how do I simulate a 64bit32bit divide with a 32bit32bit one to allow for the preshifting of the dividend Or, to look at the problem from another way, whats the best way to divide an 18.14 fixedpoint by another using standard 32bit arithmeticlogic operations best meaning fastest, smallest, or both.p  pAlgebra, V810 assembly, and pseudocode are all fine.

Negative 2313 pDue to the nature of the data that we collect in our application, its necessary to allow user to be able to search through 1,000,000 rows of data, and receive results client side as fast as possible.p  pWe have played around with various techniques, and currently experimenting with the document storage engine MongoDB. We are essentially storing the report data in Mongo in the way we want to show it on the client side. p  pBut, this is where i wanted to lean on your experience. We have used some report table plugins such as datatables.net, but when a client requests data which may match 100,000 records, the latency in delivering that data to the client side, can take well over a minute to export the JSON from server to client. p  pI have tried filtering the resultset by only sending 1000 result at a time to the client, but what if the user decides to sort a column The entire request has to be performed again, and the 1st 1000 results loaded into the client. p  pBut what if the client chooses to search within a column, the results have to be refetched again. All of these problems dont exist when emallem of the data has been loaded into the client side. p  pSo essentially my question is, how can you efficiently and speedily, allow clients to search and manipulate large datasets, but have the results delivered to the client side in a manner which doesnt require every result to be sent through in one go, therefore keeping the client side as lightweight as possiblep  pIm sure there must be some frontend datatable type plugins for MongoDB, potentially via node.js for direct JSON communication, but i cant find anythingp  pThanks for your help. p

Negative 2313 pI am currently writing a full screen web application for the iPad.  This application will likely write a small amount of data to a local cookie at an interval of once per second.  A user will interact with the application for about 20 to 30 minutes at a time.  I imagine they will use this application between one and four times a week so a maximum of 120 minutes a week or 7,200 cookie writes per week.p  pI was unable to find information regarding the number of write cycles that the iPads internal flash memory can handle.  I am concerned that my frequent cookie writes may shorten the lifespan of the iPads internal flash memory.  Is this a valid concern  If not, why not and at what number of writes should I be concernedp  pI am not completely opposed to using other storage methods, such as HTML5 local storage if this mitigates the risk.  However, I would prefer to use cookies as part of this application will be delivered on other browsers where HTML5 local storage is not supported.p

Negative 2313 pIm learning FluentNHibernate, and until now I havent specified FKs as property fields, but I let them be autogenerated, from the mappings.p  pBut is that sufficient It looks to me that in this case, if I want to save some object, I can only save new objects by saving the whole aggregate root. While I sometimes see it more appropriate to save some lower level objects only.p  pSo this question I think goes into the use of aggregate roots. How can they be structured I thought one aggregate could be part of another aggregate, which would mean you could actually save lower level aggregate without saving the whole root. Is this true And in this case, dont we need to specify the FK if we deal with a newly added entity Hence this field must be coded in our classes, and not simply autogenerated as Im currently doingp

Negative 2313 pI had some interesting tribulations in trying to test whether views were correctly bound to events. In backbone, we typically bind to events in the initialize method, using something along the lines of codesomething.bindchange, this.rendercode. In my test, I want to make sure that this binding is set up, so I did the following            p  precodethis.myView  new MyView spyOnthis.myView, render this.legendView.groupData.triggerchange expectthis.legendView.render.toHaveBeenCalled codepre  pBut, that wont work. Because the bind occurs in MyViews initialize function, the event gets bound to myViews render function AT THAT TIME. So, when you add your spy, it wraps the render function and sets it back into place at myView.render. But the closure created by the first bind still exists, and we are totally hozed. So what can we do about it What I did, is move my bind calls to a seperate function, something likep  precodemyView  Backbone.View.extend initialize function     .bindAllthis, render     this.initializemodelbindings , initializemodelbindings function     something.bindchange, this.render , render function...  codepre  pand my test then looks likep  precodethis.myView  new MyView spyOnthis.myView, render this.myView.initializemodelbindings this.legendView.groupData.triggerchange expectthis.legendView.render.toHaveBeenCalled codepre  pThis works, but Im looking for a better solution.

Negative 2313 pOne of our products is an Access database which includes a table listing thousands of addresses. Our product includes a user friendly interface for searching and filtering out the addresses. These are displayed on a form, lets call it frmAddress.p  pWe include on frmAddress an Export To Excel button which takes the current filter set and exports it to Excel.p  pTo use their filtered addresses as a datasource for a Word mailmerge, end users export to Excel first then used the Excel file as the datasource.p  pBut this is rather a long way round. Is there a way to connect directly to Access and pull out the addresses the current filter set in frmAddress, not the full table If it cant be done directly is there anything that comes closep  pThe nearest thing I can think of is to save the current filter set every time it changes as the CommandText of a dynamic query, but it seems to me that in Word 2003  Access Queries unlike Tables arent reliably visible for mailmerge purposes. p

When I create a new Source object, which has a toone relationship to a Target object, it seems to call  [voidcontrollerNSFetchedResultsController controller didChangeObject ... ] twice, with both NSFetchedResultsChangeInsert and NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate types, which causes the tableview to display inaccurate data right after the update.p  pI can recreate this with a simple example based off the standard template project that XCode generates in a navigationbased CoreData app. The template creates a Event entity with a timeStamp attribute. I want to add a new entity Tag to this event which is just a 1to1 relation with Entity, the idea being that each Event has a particular Tag from some list of tags. I create the relationship from Event to Tag in the Core Data editor, and an inverse relationship from Tag to Event. I then generate the NSManagedObject subclasses for both Event and Tag, which are pretty standardp  precodeinterface Event  NSManagedObject  private  property nonatomic, retain NSDate  timeStamp property nonatomic, retain Tag  tag  and interface Tag  NSManagedObject  private  property nonatomic, retain NSString  tagName property nonatomic, retain NSManagedObject  event codepre  pI then prefilled the Tags entity with some data at launch, so that we can pick from a Tag when inserting a new Event. In AppDelegate, call this before returning persistentStoreCoordinatorp  precodeNSManagedObjectContext context  [self managedObjectContext] NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameTag inManagedObjectContextcontext] [fetchRequest setEntityentity]  NSError error  nil NSArray fetchedObjects  [context executeFetchRequestfetchRequest erroramperror] check if Tags havent already been created. If not, then create them if fetchedObjects.count  0      NSLogcreate new objects for Tag      Tag newManagedObject1  [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForNameTag inManagedObjectContextcontext]     newManagedObject1.tagName  Home      Tag newManagedObject2  [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForNameTag inManagedObjectContextcontext]     newManagedObject2.tagName  Office      Tag newManagedObject3  [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForNameTag inManagedObjectContextcontext]     newManagedObject3.tagName  Shop   [fetchRequest release]  if [context saveamperror]      NSLogUnresolved error , , error, [error userInfo]     abort  codepre  pNow, I changed the insertNewObject code to add a Tag to the Event attribute were inserting. I just pick the first one from the list of fetchedObjects for this examplep  precode voidinsertNewObject      NSManagedObjectContext context  [self.fetchedResultsController managedObjectContext]     NSEntityDescription entity  [[self.fetchedResultsController fetchRequest] entity]     Event newManagedObject  [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName[entity name] inManagedObjectContextcontext]      If appropriate, configure the new managed object.      Normally you should use accessor methods, but using KVC here avoids the need to add a custom class to the template.     [newManagedObject setValue[NSDate date] forKeytimeStamp]      NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]     NSEntityDescription entityTag  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameTag inManagedObjectContextcontext]     [fetchRequest setEntityentityTag]     NSError errorTag  nil     NSArray fetchedObjects  [context executeFetchRequestfetchRequest erroramperrorTag]     if fetchedObjects.count gt 0          Tag newtag  [fetchedObjects objectAtIndex0]         newManagedObject.tag  newtag            Save the context.     NSError error  nil     if [context saveamperror]              NSLogUnresolved error , , error, [error userInfo]         abort       codepre  pI want to now see the tableview reflecting these changes, so I made the UITableViewCell to type UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle and changed configureCell to show me the  tagName in the detail text labelp  precode voidconfigureCellUITableViewCell cell atIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      Event managedObject  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]     cell.textLabel.text  [[managedObject valueForKeytimeStamp] description]     cell.detailTextLabel.text  managedObject.tag.tagName  codepre  pNow everythings in place. When I call insertNewObject, it seems to create the first row fine, but the 2nd row is a duplicate of the first, even though the timestamp should be a few seconds apart img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comquy6u.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I scroll the screen up and down, it refreshes the rows and then displays the right results with the correct time. When I step through the code, the core problem comes up inserting a new row seems to be calling [NSFetchedResultsController controller didChangeObject ...] twice, once for the insert and once for an update. Im not sure WHY the update is called though. And heres the clincher if I strongremove the inverse relationshipstrong between Event and Tag, the inserts starts working just fine Only the insert is called, the row isnt duplicated, and things work well.p  pSo what is it with the inverse relationship that is causing NSFetchedResultsController delegate methods to be called twice And should I just live without them in this case I know that XCode gives a warning if the inverse isnt specified, and it seems like a bad idea. Am I doing something wrong here Is this some known issue with a known workaroundp  pThanks.p

Negative 2313 pIm trying to use codeistreamiteratorcode for reading characters from codecincode. Ive read that pressing codeCtrlDcode sends an codeEOFcode character which ends the input stream. Unfortunately, something is going wrong with it. Heres my codep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiteratorgt int main    using namespace std    istreamiteratorltchargt itcin, eos   while it  eos clog ltlt it  codepre  pIm running it and typing codeas dfcode, then pressing kbdCtrlDkbd. It outputs only codeasdcode without the last codefcode and then hangs waiting for input. When I type codeghcode and press kbdCtrlDkbd again, it prints the remaining codefcode at last, and the codegcode from next input, but again without the last codehcode. And when I finally press kbdCtrlDkbd without typing anything, it prints the remaining codehcode and exits.p  pI expected it to read codeasdfcode and exit, since I already pressed kbdCtrlDkbd at the end of this first sequence.p  pWhy is it still waiting for input after getting codeEOFcodebr Why it doesnt print the last character read before codeEOFcodebr And why it exits only when I press kbdCtrlDkbd without typing anything beforebr How does this loop need to change to make it behave in the way I expect i.e. stop reading immediately after getting kbdCtrlDkbd sequence in the input, no matter I typed anything before or not, and reading emallem characters up to the codeEOFcode.p
Negative 2313 pI need to efficiently swap the byte order of an array emduringem copying into another array.p  pThe source array is of a certain type char, short or int so the byte swapping required is unambiguous and will be according to that type.p  pMy plan is to do this very simply with a multipass bytewise copy 2 for short, 4 for int, ....  However are there any preexisting memcpyswap163264 functions or libraries Perhaps in image processing for BGRRGB image processing.p  pEDITp  pI know how to swap the bytes of individual values, that is not the problem. I want to do this process during a copy emthat I am going to perform anywayem.  p  pFor example, if I have an array or little endian 4byte integers I can do they swap by performing 4 bytewise copies with initial offsets of 0, 1, 2 and 3 with a stride of 4. But there may be a better way, perhaps even reading each 4byte integer individually and using the byteswap intrinsics byteswapushort, byteswapulong and byteswapuint64 would be faster. But I suspect there must be existing functions that do this type of processing.p  pEDIT 2p  pJust found this, which may be a useful basis for SSE, though its true that memory bandwidth probably makes it a waste of time.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7194452fastvectorizedconversionfromrgbtobgraFast vectorized conversion from RGB to BGRAap

Negative 2313 pI am a newbie to writing JSPs.p  pIn my JSP I have dynamically created a form with select boxes i.e. these fields are not in htmlp  pIn one of the selectboxes, I implemented a onchange method which passes the value as a parameter and redisplays the form.  When the form is redisplayed the parameter Ive passed, sets the value of another select box according to the parameters value, using an external XML file.p  pOne Problem is that after the onchange method as the current page is resent and reloaded, selected values of the other fields around 10 fields are lost.p  pCurrently I use the following approach using the Session to address this problem in my JSP in the onchange method, I use javascript to load selected values and pass them as  parameters to a servlet in a GET request.  In the servlet, I receive the parameters and set attributes in the session.p  pIn the JSP, I use getAttributes in the session and change the selected values during the dynamic creation of the form.p  pI wonder if there is a simpler way to do this as I have to create a lots of fields for this to work. Also I didnt make use of a databean in this case.p  pSince dynamic creation of fields is using java logic, Is it true that ajax cant be usedp  pCould you please advise me on the quality of my design  Am I staying true to the MVC design patternp

Negative 2313 pThis is a problem I inherited.  We have a JSFRichFacesSeam app, which for security reasons has nocache set.  The problem comes when users hit the backbutton, causing a repost of a form.  Sometimes and it is inconsistent the form rePOST after hitting the backbutton sets the backing bean properties to null.  When caching is set to private, this does not happen.  Unfortunately, that is not an option.p  pI have been looking for a workaround for this, and Im not sure there is one.p  pDoes anyone know of a standard pattern to use for thisp

Negative 2313 pOk, so I am trying to develop a mobile website application for the iPhone and Android. Currently my site uses cURL to log the user into the other site. I have a PHP script that creates a cookie based on the username of the user. cURL then places the info into that cookie. The cookie is stored on my sites host.p  pBasically this mobile site I am creating is suppose to allow users to log into a forum that I developed this for site owner would not allow me to create a mobile version on their site so needed to do it on mine. Then once they log in they can read posts and reply to them. When it goes to read a thread needs to load the cookie, as well as when they try to make a post.p  pHow can I get the cookie to save to the users phone rather than my server The reason I ask is, Id like it so my host doesnt get filled up with dozens of text files with credentials of users which I dont want to see so I am not phishing. p  pI want it so the user signs in, cookie gets saved to the phone. They want to read a post the phone pulls up that cookie. They want to post, phone pulls up the cookie. p  pI looked into PHP setcookie function, wasnt sure if that is what I needed. p  pAny help provided will be appreciated.p

Negative 2313 pI have to write a query where a regular expression which is java based i believe POSIX standard is to send to a stored procedure. Which will use this regex string to query database to fetch only those records which statisfy the regex. p  pI was reading about a hrefhttpwww.regularexpressions.infooracle.html relnofollowRegular Expressionsa and i saw that oracle regular expressions arent same as Java i.e. p  blockquote   pWith version 10g, Oracle Database offers 4 regexp functions that you   can use in SQL and PLSQL statements. These functions implement the   POSIX Extended Regular Expressions ERE standard. Oracle fully   supports collating sequences and equivalence classes in bracket   expressions. The NLSSORT setting determines the POSIX locale used,   which determines the available collating sequences and equivalence   classes.p      pOracle does not implement the POSIX ERE standard exactly, however. It   deviates in three areas. First, Oracle supports the backreferences 1   through 9 in the regular expression. The POSIX ERE standard does not   support these, even though POSIX BRE does. In a fully compliant   engine, 1 through 9 would be illegal. The POSIX standard states it   is illegal to escape a character that is not a metacharacter with a   backslash. Oracle allows this, and simply ignores the backslash. E.g.   z is identical to z in Oracle. The result is that all POSIX ERE   regular expressions can be used with Oracle, but some regular   expressions that work in Oracle may cause an error in a fully   POSIXcompliant engine. Obviously, if you only work with Oracle, these   differences are irrelevant.p      pThe third difference is more subtle. It wont cause any errors, but   may result in different matches. As I explained in the topic about the   POSIX standard, it requires the regex engine to return the longest   match in case of alternation. Oracles engine does not do this. It is   a traditional NFA engine, like all nonPOSIX regex flavors discussed   on this website.p      pIf youve worked with regular expressions in other programming   languages, be aware that POSIX does not support nonprintable   character escapes like t for a tab or n for a newline. You can use   these with a POSIX engine in a programming language like C, because   the C compiler will interpret the t and n in string constants. In   SQL statements, youll need to type an actual tab or line break in the   string with your regular expression to make it match a tab or line   break. Oracles regex engine will interpret the string t as the   regex t when passed as the regexp parameter.p blockquote  pJust wondering if there is some sort of help that i can use to tackle this issue Or do i have to transfer Java regex into PLSQL regexp  pThe regex which we are going to use is going to be used widely within Java. There are few usecases where the same regex would be applied to oracle Stored Procedures.

Negative 2313 pI have a UITableView populated with custom UITableViewCells.  Within those custom cells, I have a UITextField and a See More UIButton.  The purpose of the UIButton is to dynamically expand that particular UITableCell when the user wishes to read more of the text.  In the same way, when the user wishes to return to the original size, the user clicks the Button again, and the UITableViewCell will shrink to the original size.p  pSince the cell isnt being selected, I setup an IBAction within the Custom Cell like suchp  pWithin CustomCell.mp  precode IBActionshowMoreTextidsender      instance bool variable to flag whether the cell has been resized     self.hasBeenResized  YES      turn off mask to bounds, otherwise cell doesnt seem to resize     [[self.cellView layer] setMasksToBoundsNO]       Calculate the new sizes and positions for the textView and the button      CGRect newTextViewFrame  self.textView.frame     newTextViewFrame.size.height  self.textView.contentSize.height     self.textView.frame  newTextViewFrame      CGFloat bottomYPos  self.textView.frame.origin.y  self.textView.frame.size.height     CGRect buttonFrame  self.showMoreButton.frame     buttonFrame.origin.y  bottomYPos     self.showMoreButton.frame  buttonFrame       Call begin and end updates     [UITableView self.superview beginUpdates]        [UITableView self.superview endUpdates]       Set mask and put rounded corners on the cell     [[self.cellView layer] setMasksToBoundsYES]     [[self.cellView layer] setCornerRadius10.0]  codepre  pFollowing this, I have this in my ViewController classp  precode Within ViewController.m  CGFloattableViewUITableView tableView heightForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      NSLogheightForRowAtIndexPath      CustomCell cell  CustomCell[self tableViewtableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]      if[cell hasBeenResized]  NO              return cell.frame.size.height  20          else              return cell.frame.size.height  cell.textView.frame.origin.y  cell.textView.frame.size.height  cell.showMoreButton.frame.size.height  20       codepre  pWhat happens now is I can see the custom cell change the size of its textview, however, the table does not update the row height for that particular cell.  Checking on the Ifelse statement there, it appears that hasBeenResized is always false, even though I set it to YES within the IBACtion of the CustomCell.p  pI have looked at other solutions here, but they all seem to involve didSelectRowAtIndexPath, which I cannot use in this instance I have another behavior for the cell when it is selected.p  pAm I doing this completely wrong  Ideally, what I would like to do is to have the Show More button animate downwards as the textview is expanded and vice versa when its collapsed.p  pThank youp

Negative 2313 pSorry to waste time with this one.  Ive been trying to get a page to stack background colors in css, I just wasnt sure how to ask how to do this.  For instance, Id like to have a white header section which could be 150 pixels in height, then directly beneath that a specific color which might be 20 pixels in height and stretches the width of the page, then repeating this two or three more times with other colors then ending with another large white footer.

Negative 2313 pI request you to understand the problem we are facing with Sync for which I need your help and guide.p  pWhat we have 1 50 tables to be synced, divided into 6 common scopes and 8 template based scopesparameterized based on CLIENTID column of CLIENT table. 2 Sync is to be done from different PCs to SQL Azure 3 From C WPF App, we select a clientCLIENTID, run sync setupprovisioning and then start sync process using method.p  pIssue we face very often 1 Few clients are already synced, on a nth client, due to network connectivity issue  timeout issue, app needs to be closed. When we run provision on that particular client again, sometime we get exception that Selectchanges or bulkInsert is missing.p  p2 If the above happens, we deStoreProvision, then reprovision. That leaves us with client and server having the same set of data. If we proceed with sync then, it takes 7 hours to complete erroring out with lots of INSERT CONFLICTS.p  pSo, when in the mid of syncing, network connectivity fails, COMMIT happens with scopes that ran successfully Or, few scopes that ran well leave us with partial syncing Is there any way of getting rid of numbers of Insert Conflicts except eprovision and reprovisionp  pThanksp

Negative 2313 pIm doing some work with MARSSx86, a QEMUbased x86 simulator. Im trying to send some data between the guest OS and the simulator. Normally, this is handled by using a library provided by the developer that writes to a special area in memory reserved for this sort of communication. However, Im trying to do this operation in kernel space, and the library depends on doing an mmap, which obviously wont work. As I understand it, all I need to do is get access to a known physical address and write some data there.p  pIm very unfamiliar with memory operations, especially in the kernel, but I feel like this should be straightforward.

Negative 2313 pIve written a custom replication function in a standard C windows forms app with a SQL Server 2008 Express database.

After which it suddenly seems to jump to around 300mb and then grows until I hit a OutOfMemory exception.p  pIs the method Im using even possible, can I process that many statements inside a single transaction I would assume I should be able to do this. If there is a better way Id love to here it. I need this to be transactional otherwise a partial replication would result in a broken database.p  pThanks.p  pEDITp  pAfter restarting my computer I managed to get a full 200k replication to go through. Even though it did at one point grow in memory usage to 1.4Gb after the replication completed the memory usage dropped all the way back to 40mb. Which leads me to conclude that something inside my loop that processes the commands is causing the growth in memory perhaps.p

Negative 2313 pIm getting an abort under very limited circumstances and Im trying to find out what statement or statements is causing it. The console says p  blockquote   pTerminating app due to uncaught exception   NSInvalidArgumentException, reason [NSPathStore2 setDelegate]   unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1d50dcb0p blockquote  pNSPathStore2 doesnt appear anywhere in my code so that must be called by some framework Im using. The instance address doesnt appear anywhere else so I cant tell what that is. p  pI tried using breakpoints to catch when the abort happens, but then it doesnt happen any more. So maybe its a timing problem. I read in other posts that NSPathStore2 is part of NSString so I tried putting print statements around various string statements but that didnt help. Searching developer.apple.com for NSPathStore2 doesnt find anything.p  pI think the abort happens during an init method but that method is long and it calls other long methods before its done. Also, it only happens after running through a 5minute sequence of actions and only after a fresh install from Xcode. If I run the app a second time it doesnt abort. So its very time consuming trying to find where this is coming from.p

Negative 2313 pI have a nested array that is compiled via the model in a CakePHP request. The array can be nested at a variable depth, and the content is to be returned to the user.p  pCurrently the looping and rendering process for this array is completed using a function in the View element of the request. This function is first called at the base arrays depth, and repeated for any array element that has further array children. eg.p  precodefunction printdepthelements    foreachelements as element      echo element[title]      ifelement[children]        printdepthelement[children]           printdepthelements codepre  pWith this process, I can print out all levels of the array, whilst still keeping the markup flexibility within the view hence, it is skinnable, but I imagine this is the incorrect location for the function that handles this.p  pIs there a more MVCvalid process for this operationp

Negative 2313 pLately Ive been tinkering with TDD and coding based on the SOLID principles .  I have a scenario as followsp  ul liOne can have codeIRecurringProfilecode, which performs a series of payments on an interval, e.g monthly basisli liWhen a payment tries to go through and it fails, a codeIRecurringProfileTransactioncode is created linked to the codeIRecurringProfilePaymentcode to show that the payment did not go through.  li liThe failure count for the payment is incremented.li liThe datetime for which to retry payment and send another failure notification if payment is failed is also updated.li liIf the failure count for a payment reaches a maximum threshold e.g 3 failed attempts, the codeIRecurringProfilecode is suspended.li liAlso, with each failure, a notification is sent to inform the client that the payment did not go through, and will be retried again.li ul  pBelow is some sample code I created, which mainly deals with the task of marking a recurring profile payment as failed.  I tried to follow on the SOLID principles, as well as constructor injection.  Would like to know if this is violating any of these principles or any programming bestpractices, and subject the code to any form of scrutiny so that it can be improved.  The code also uses NHibernate as the ORM.p  precodepublic class RecurringPaymentMarkAsFailure      private readonly IPaymentFailedNotificationSender paymentFailedNotificationSender     private readonly IRecurringProfileFailureNextNotificationDateUpdater failureNotificationDateUpdater     private readonly IRecurringProfileSuspender recurringProfileSuspender      public RecurringPaymentMarkAsFailureIPaymentFailedNotificationSender paymentFailedNotificationSender, IRecurringProfileSuspender recurringProfileSuspender,         IRecurringProfileFailureNextNotificationDateUpdater failureNotificationDateUpdater              this.paymentFailedNotificationSender  paymentFailedNotificationSender         this.failureNotificationDateUpdater  failureNotificationDateUpdater          this.recurringProfileSuspender  recurringProfileSuspender            private void checkProfileStatusIRecurringProfile profile              if profile.Status  Enums.RecurringProfileStatus.Active                      throw new Exceptions.RecurringProfileExceptionThis cannot be called when the profile is not marked as active                     private void incrementFailureCountIRecurringProfilePayment payment              payment.FailureCount           public IRecurringProfileTransaction MarkPaymentAsFailedIRecurringProfilePayment payment, string failureData              using var t  BeginTransaction                      checkProfileStatuspayment.RecurringProfile               IRecurringProfileTransaction transaction  payment.Transactions.CreateNewItem             transaction.OtherData  failureData             transaction.Status  Enums.RecurringProfileTransactionStatus.Failure             paymentFailedNotificationSender.CreateAndQueueNotificationtransaction             failureNotificationDateUpdater.UpdateNextFailureNotificationDatepayment             incrementFailureCountpayment              if payment.FailureCount gt payment.RecurringProfile.MaximumFailedAttempts                              recurringProfileSuspender.SuspendRecurringProfilepayment.RecurringProfile                          transaction.Save             t.Commit             return transaction                  codepre  pp  pAs a side note, this question complements my most recent post about a similar topic.p

Negative 2313 pWhen you plug in an LTE modem, as part of the attach process to the LTE network, it sets up a default EPS bearer to carry signalling traffic.  This default bearer is an IP connection with a Traffic Flow Template suitable for signalling traffic.  The specification also allows, that the network can change the TFT of the default EPS bearer so that it can carry data TS 24.301 6.4.1.1, last sentence.p  pSo, if the network does set up the default EPS bearer to carry data and does not create a dedicated EPS bearer, my tests show that Windows wont allow you to browse on the internet until you have set up a connection in the traditional way, eg called the Mobile Broadband API Connect function in Win 7.p  pHere is the question what does Windows still have to do to allow internet browsing, given that an IP connection with suitable quality of service is already openp  pMany thanks in advance for help.p

Negative 2313 pBasically, I created a codebuild.xmlcode for Apache Ant.

Negative 2313 pI am trying to debug my problem. I have imported a library that will extract YouTube URLs from a playlist. Once this library is finished the extraction process, it will fire an event with codedocument.triggerplaylistDonecode. I then listen for the event viap  precodedocument.onplaylistDone, function     alert done    codepre  pI never receive the alert though. My website is currently massive, so it is difficult to debug. I have verified that the library is indeed working by creating a blank page, and the library does indeed fire off the trigger. This leads me to believe something on my site is causing the problem.p  pI have also donep  precodedocument.onclick, function     alert done    codepre  pto verify that default events are not disabled. My next step is to determine if somehow custom events are disabled.p  pTo note, my website is using Bootstrap and Twig. I pray that they are not responsible for my issue.p

Negative 2313 pIm using AVPlayer in a Cocoa app, and Ive implemented a command that jumps to the end of the video.p  pThe problem is, AVPlayer doesnt seek to where I told it to.p  pFor example, one of the videos I have is 4 minutes and 14 seconds long. When I seek to the end, AVPlayer seeks to 4 minutes and 12 secondstwo seconds short. If I then hit play, the player will play for two seconds, emthenem reach the end.p  pMy first attempt was thisp  precode[self.player seekToTimeself.player.currentItem.duration] codepre  pIve switched it to thisp  precode[self.player seekToTimeself.player.currentItem.duration         toleranceBeforekCMTimePositiveInfinity          toleranceAfterkCMTimeZero] codepre  pNeither one works any better than the other.p  pI also tried seeking to codekCMTimePositiveInfinitycode. It just ignored me then.p  pIt doesnt seem to matter whether the player has loaded that part of the video yet. I can even seek to the notquiteend, play through to the true end, then try again to seek to the end, and it will jump back to the notquiteend.p  pThe shortfall is not always two seconds. On some of my videos, it works more or less exactly correctly, jumping very close to the true end if not exactly to it. On at least one, it goes to three seconds short. Length does not seem to be a factor all of these are about the same length, except for one, which is over an hour long and seeks to two seconds short.p  pSo, why is AVPlayer jumping as many as three seconds short of where I told it to, and how do I convince it to jump to the moment I asked forp

Negative 2313 pI have a directed acyclic graph, composed of Node objects. Each node has a list of codestdsharedptrcodes to other nodes, which are its children in the graph.

Should I treat codesharedptrltNodegtcode as the representation of node objects Or maybe the way to choose is more sophisticatedp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2313 pI have an application that I only want to run in landscape mode e.g. landscape or reverse landscape so I am using sensorLandscape in the manifest.p  pMy problem is here I also have a video recorder working eg using the camera. Now I set the display orientation when i prepare the camera, but the problem is that if I change orientation that change stays preview is upside down. When using sensor landscape how do I know when the UI is changed. I have tried using onConfigurationCanged but unfortunately I need to have the app run on both pre honeycomb devices mainly gingerbread and post honeycomb devices jelly bean. p  pSince in order to properly have onConfigurationChanged called i need to set target api to like 8, but sensor landscape is only available 9. I need to set it to 8 because in the older apis you need to add screenSize to your configChanges otherwise it will not be called. So these calls have alot of incompatabilities between eachother.p  pNow that the background is done and you guys know what I have tried already. My question is How can I find out when my orientation changes callback, or something else so that I can change my camera display orientationp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 2313 pIm creating a puppet rig for an animation I am making. Ive created two custom classes that inherit from the MovieClip class. One is the head Im animating facing the camera and another is the 34ths view of the same head. Ive modified both constructors to add an event listener that calls the function codefacRigcode which helps me animate the heads by calling other functions like codemoveEyes, moveMouthcode etc.p  precodepublic function FMichaelFULLHEAD      super     faceRigOverLoad ltbug workaround     this.gotoAndPlayMovieCliproot.currentFrame Sync movieclips with timeline     addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME,faceRig  codepre  pHowever, the function is always called one frame after the codeMovieClipcode appears in the timeline. This delay makes animating impossible because I have to constantly switch between the front view and the 34ths view I switch by making a new keyframe in the timeline and dragging the symbol from the library. Every time I switch there is one frame where the mouth is not talking and the eyes are not moving.p  pThe bug workaround kinda solves the problem. Now first time either head appears on stage it begins animating immediately, but if I switch from the front view to the 34ths view back to the front view, the front view gets delayed again.p  pI suspected this might be because the constructor doesnt get run again so i tried to make each instance of the heads unique by naming them codefrontHead1code and codefrontHead2code in the objects property box, however it didnt help at all.p

Negative 2313 pI already have a function where I am getting data from database and fill it in HTML table on combobox change event basically I am doing this using ajax. p  pBut every time I am calling the database on combobox change which is not efficient. So, now I decided I fill the data in the html table initially on page load and then filter out from the HTML table instead of every time going to the database and filter it.p  pSo is there any way of filter out data from the html table on combo box change event or it is possible to call ajax on html tablep  pThanks.p

Here is my pathetic attempt, which fails as it only returns tasks with notes and then duplicates task records at that one for each note, so its a complete fail.p  precodeSELECT  Task.ID,     Task.Name,     Note.Complete     FROM     Task             JOIN     SELECT IDTask,         MAXDate AS Date         FROM         Note         GROUP BY         IDTask AS InnerNote     ON     Task.ID  InnerNote.IDTask     JOIN     Note     ON     Task.ID  Note.IDTask codepre  pCan anyone help me pleasep

Negative 2313 pI am porting the famous packet capture software  WinPcap from NDIS 5.0 to NDIS 6.x. I tried to translate every NDIS 5.0 function to its 6.0 version. In WinPcap sourcecode function NdisOpenAdapter is called by NPFOpenAdapter in Openclos.c. I translated it to NdisOpenAdapterEx for NDIS 6.0. But I cannot find a way to set the 4th parameter BindContext.  The delcaration of NdisOpenAdapterEx can be found here a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwareff563715vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowshardwareff563715vvs.85.aspxap  pAlso MS said A protocol driver must call NdisOpenAdapterEx from its ProtocolBindAdapterEx function. NDIS fails any attempt to call NdisOpenAdapterEx outside the context of ProtocolBindAdapterEx.. So it seems that NdisOpenAdapterEx cannot be called in NPFOpenAdapter. it must be called in the NPFBindAdapterEx function. I substituted the driver npf.sys with my own version, started Wireshark a packet capture frontend, set breakpoints in NPFBindAdapterEx and found NPFBindAdapterEx was never called before NPFOpenAdapter. So it is impposible for me to get the BindContext paramters before calling NdisOpenAdapterEx.p  pI just want to imgrate WinPcap to NDIS 6.0 with modifications as small as possible. And how to solve this problemp  pHere is the code of Openclos.cp  precode      Copyright c 1999  2005 NetGroup, Politecnico di Torino Italy  Copyright c 2005  2010 CACE Technologies, Davis California  All rights reserved.

Negative 2313 pI m working on a project for sending some big size object throw UDP protocolwritten in c, all works well. The problem is that there is a difference in connection speed between the Client and Server that causing a loss of about 70  of the packets. The solution that I m working on is to put a sleep while sending the packets to slow down the emission process. For that I want to know if ther is any methodes for getting the optimal sleeping time between two consicutives emissions because I need to have the maximum possible speed. If you need more details, just ask. Thanks for helping,p

Negative 2313 pWell, Im designing a web application using Django. The application allow users to select a photo from the computer system and keep populating onto the users timeline. The timeline view have a listgrid of all the photos which the user has uploaded sorted chronologically, showing 50 photos and then a pull to refresh to fetch the next 50 photos on the timeline.The implementation works for multiple users. p  pNow for fast user experience of the app Im considering caching. Like most sites store the timeline of the user onto cache so that whenever the user logs in it the first place to check for information the request is served out of  the cache and if it is not available there then you go to the DB to query for the information.p  pPrimarily in one line Im trying to cache all the timelines for different users in cache for now.p  pIm done with building of the webapp minus the cache part. So , my question is how do I cache all the timelines of different usersp

Negative 2313 pI have this list which shows nine posts on my page. Each post have a likefunction tied to it, so that a user can like each post, and see the number of likes update. This is achieved by a simple ajax call. p  pThe user can also load more posts by pushing button so that nine more post are appended via ajax. This works fine, but my problem is with the likefunction which is tied to the posts which are loaded via the load morefunction. p  pThis function has one parameter which is the id of the last inserted post iden. It takes all the li in the ul and creates a list called listItems. It then iterates over listItems, checks if the id of the post is less than the last inserted and then ties a click event to the likesymbol of the post. The function is called each time you push the load more button.  p  precodefunction likenmoreiden      var listItems  ul.statuses.findli    var i  0    console.loglistItems         .eachlistItems, function index, element      var id  this.attrclass     if id lt iden           console.logid     i     .likemore  i.liveclick, functione     e.preventDefault          .ajax                 type POST,                 url like.php,                 data id id  ampnum1,                 success functiondata                  .hearts  id.htmldata                                                                           codepre  pThere are two problems with this function. p  ol lipWhen I push the load more button the first time, I can like the first eight of the nine newly appended posts, but the click event is not tied to the ninth and last one. If I do console.logid I can see that the id of the last one is not printed, event though it is in the list listItems, which I have already checked. pli lipWhen I push the load more button the second time, all of the posts, not just the ones with a id lower than the last inserted, gets a click event tied to them, which creates double posting when a button is clicked.

Negative 2313 pI have a web application that will get domain objects from a web service, which in turn gets them from a database via NHibernate.p  pId like to be able to transfer these objects with uninstantiated members members that are typically lazyloaded from the database in the web service and then have subsequent calls automatically made to the web service when the application code tries to access them.  Essentially a process identical to regular NH lazy loading, except with the web service in place of the database server.p  pNote that this happens within a LAN and with low transaction rates, so Im not concerned with whatever performance penalty this is likely to have.p  pI would think that whats needed is first code that gets invoked when serializing to the objects that turns the NH lazyloading proxy information into something that can be reconstructed on the client side, and then clientside code to deserialize that information into objects of a different proxy type, one that will make a webservice call to retrieve the lazy data when it is referenced.p  pI would think someone would have developed such a framework already, but I havent managed to find it, so I figured a direct question was in order.p  pIf you know of any work thats been done in this area, please respond.p  pMichaelp

Negative 2313 pWe are having issues with our clients being unregistered randomly, typically 1 hour after registration occurs but has been up to 3 or 4 hours. We are trying to determine when the unregistration is happening so we can identify the bug.p  pSo I am aware that the unregistration process for GCM generally takes about 1 hour. That being said, is it unheard of for unregistration to take stronglonger than 1 hourstrong.p  pThis is fairly important because if it always takes somewhere in the range of 5070 minutes as I have typically seen, then it means unregistration is occuring immediately for our clients. That would rule out a large amount of scenarios where our device may be getting unregistered.p  pSo the question to reitterate is Is there a guaranteed time that GCM unregistration will fall under Can I strongguaranteestrong for instance that GCM will have unregistered my device if I tell it to unregister, 2 hours afer I make the call 2 hours as an example.p

Negative 2313 pI have two spring projects both using maven. The first is a client for some api and the second is a console program that, in part, utilises that client.p  pI have packaged up the client into a jar and referenced it in the pom for the console program.p  pI have managed to get this working, just about, but I am not very happy with the solutionp  pstrong1strong The first problem I ran into was that each of the context xml files were named applicationContext.xml. Therefore, I couldnt work out any way to reference the context file in the client, without renaming it to something else e.g. clientContext.xml. This works but is there any other way to reference it explicitlyp  pstrong2strong The next issue was how to invoke the clientContext.xml from within the console program. To do this, I have added codeltimport resourceosrdClientContext.xmlgtcode to the applicationContext.xml of the console program and this seems to allow it to correctly find all of the defined beans. Im not sure if this is best practice thoughp  pstrong3strong Within clientContext.xml, I need to reference a properties file and so have the line codeltcontextpropertyplaceholder locationclasspathapi.properties gtcode. This works when running the client on its own but appears to get ignored or fails to find the file when running the console program. The api.properties file is in the root of the packaged jar for the client and the jar is in the classpath of the console program. The only workaround I have found is to manually copy the properties file into the console program, at which point it is found without any problem.p  pstrong4strong Both projects have a resources directory with subdirectories dev, beta and prod. This allows me to define different properties depending on the maven profile I want to run against. This works fine for the individual projects but when I package the client, it only includes the properties files for the profile I am running against which makes sense. However, that then means if I run the console project against profile beta, it will still run the client against whatever profile it was packaged against. It would be handy to be able to package all of the properties files and get the client to run in the same profile as whatever is depending on it. Is that possiblea good ideap

Negative 2313 pIn Eclipse, there are two places where you can define code templatesp  ul liPreferences  Java  Code Style  Code Templatesli liPreferences  Java  Editor  Templatesli ul  pThe latter accepts a variable codecursorcode in order to place the cursor somewhere useful. The first doesnt support that variable. I assume its because code style doesnt have anything to do with placing cursors. But Im not sure about that.p  pThe problem is that its not possible to define the cursor position when e. g. adding Javadoc. I use fancy keyboard shortcuts like kbdAltkbdkbdJkbd with a capital J in order to have eclipse generate Javadoc. But after that I always have to move the cursor before I can start typing. Is it possible to automate that somewhow If not I dont get the advantage of kbdAltkbdkbdJkbd over codecode which also generates correct Javadoc emandem puts or leaves the cursor where it should be.p

Negative 2313 pFor the past several weeks Ive been working with Java and I know that this question may be dumb... p  pI created a console application which is using the MySQL Connector to update records in a database, the problem is that when I deploy it to a jar file and run it I get that the MySQL Connector is missing.

Negative 2313 pSo heres my problem Im using a function and I need the function to be specific to each tr with the class middleone. Its supposed to change the insides of a div inside of the the tr with the class middleone. But its not working p  pI know the recursive portion of it is working, and the navigation should be spot on, because even when im using just this it doesnt do anything. When using document.getElementById it works fine but of course that only targets the first div and the full version of the code has to Go here, pull from here, put it here, go to the next area, pull from here.. etc Heres the testing code.p  precode.middleone.eachfunction      var tripleeagain  this.finddiv     tripleeagain.innerHTML    codepre  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 2313 pIn this setup Im using Urban Airship for the backend, GCM to push the notifications and then a small array of 2.34.04.1 devices.p  pAll devices register successfully with GCM I can confirm this in the console. Urban Airship also has no problem sending the notifications, the API keys are set up correctly.p  pTherefore I think something might be wrong with the manifest file as the 2.3 device never receives the notification. All the other 4.0 devices receive them, just not the 2.3 device. It could be a problem with that particular device but I only have the one 2.3 device to test with.p  pWould anyone mind having a look at the Android manifest file to see if Ive made an obvious errorp

Negative 2313 pI am having the weirdest of problems. In chrome browser alone, one of my html divs get an additional inline css tag added to it. This tag is codestyleoverflowhiddencode, this was causing the layout to break and we quick found out this was the problem. p  pHowever there is no place in the codebase that we could search which lets us know how this tag is getting added. is there a way to debug this I tried the chrome javascript debugger but it did not help me find the issue. In all other browsers the tag does not appear. In chrome it appends itself to a div element. We tried searching on the div element assuming that jqueryjavascript is doing a late manipulation of the element but still cannot find where it is happening.p  pIs there a watch we can set on an element to see when it is changing or who is manipulating itp

Negative 2313 pI am working on an application for which I need to write a data access layer. My first thought was to create a bunch of repositories for each entity that I need but I am now facing the a challenge with separating the different actions of a repository. I would like to hear your thoughts on this.p  pFirst, I would like to support two types of communication to the database  direct sql queries for example, insert into, update, etc and bulk inserts like loading data from a file or other source. However, both of these implementation do different thingsp  ul liThe simple repository fires a query to SQL serverli liThe bulk repository first adds a record to a file or in memory. Once it is done processing all records, it synchronizes with the database.li ul  pMy first attempt at the class structure for this isp  precode  public class Product        public interface IProductRepository      Product GetProductint id     void CreateProductProduct p       public class SqlProductRepository  IProductRepository        public Product GetProductint id            throw new NotImplementedException           public void CreateProductProduct p            throw new NotImplementedException               public class BulkLoadRepository  IProductRepository        public Product GetProductint id            throw new NotImplementedException           public void CreateProductProduct p            throw new NotImplementedException             codepre  pHowever, this structure is missing a synchronization function at the end for the bulk repository. If I do end up adding a Sync function, I will need to leave it empty for the simple repository.p  pAny thoughts on how to support both functionalities but still hide them behind one interfacep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2313 pI am working on software that accepts incoming TCP connections and have come across something that I dont understand. First, I will explain what the software is basically doing. Keep in mind that some of the parts are temporary, I understand this is most likely a poor way of doing things, but during prototyping I have run across this issue.p  pI have the main process establish a signal handler for SIGINT. The main process then starts a new thread, call it the listener, with pthreadcreate defaults. The listener first opens a socket, binds, listens, and sets the socket nonblocking. Then the listener will poll the socket with select, waiting for incoming connections.p  pNow, if I have a dumb while1 loop in the main thread, I am able to connect to the socket without issue. The problem is if I replace the while1 loop with a pause, I can no longer connect to the socket. I know the listener thread is still active through log messages. Again, I dont plan on using the pause but I would just like to know what is going on.p  pIs pause blocking a certain signal from reaching the child threadp  pstrongUPDATEstrong The stripped down code I have provided does not seem to exhibit the same behavior. I will update again if I can determine the cause.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I figured out the issue. There was one critical difference between the code I posted and my problem code. Here are the differencesp  precodestatic void listenerthreadvoid arg      int listenport  int arg     int listenfd     fdset readSet     int fdsMax, status     struct timeval timeout      ifopenlistenportlistenport, amplistenfd  1 codepre  p...p  precodeint startlistenerthreadint port      int status  0      if0 gt pthreadcreateampthreadid, NULL, listenerthread, void ampport codepre  pAnd in main.cp  precode    if0  status ampamp 1  startlistenerthread3000 codepre  pSo you can see I was passing the port number to the thread as a pointer to a stack location. Not a good idea. The strange thing is that it would work if I changed the pause to a while1 loop. And with pause the port number just happened to be a valid port.p  pAllocating space for the port number in startlistenerthread solves the issue.

Negative 2313 pSuppose I have an codeNSArrayControllercode containing a number of blob objects. These objects are displayed in a viewbased codeNSTableViewcode via bindings.p  pNow suppose that each blob object contains a property called codeamountcode. For one of the codeNSViewcodes in each row of the table Id like to display codeamount  maxamountinarraycode.p  pIn other words, I somehow need to bind my cell to the codeNSArrayControllercodes codearrangedObjects.max.amountcode and to the codeNSTableViewCellcodes codeobjectValue.amountcode at the same time and perform my calculation.p  pIs there a way to handle this nicely using bindingsp  pCurrently the only idea I have to is to have a coderatiocode property in blob and recalculate it myself every time that an object is added to the array.

Negative 2313 pI need to do some validation testing of a new feed handler I have made. I have some pcap data that I captured from the production network and I would like to have my development feed handler connect to the replay of this data and compare the results. p  pMy pcap I have a prod application that connects to a data feed, a TCP connection to an external server lets call assume this is 123.456.789.11234. This external sever then sends data to my application there is almost no client to server communication the server just sends the client data until the client drops. I have a pcap of all the packets sent to and from port 1234. I got this pcap by mirroring the production port SPAN on the switch and attaching tcpdump to an interface plugged in to the mirrored network port. When I look at the PCAP in wireshark it has all the data I would expect. p  pMy problem I am in no way a network engineer and I am unsure how I can use this pcap to test my application. What I would like to do is replay this stream form the pcap and connect to it with my development application to validate that the data is being handled the same was it was on the prod connection.  p  pI would like to some how replay the data sent from 123.456.789.112344 on 127.0.0.11234 and then connect to 127.0.0.11234 with my dev application. I looked at tcpreplay but from the documents I can not seem to figure out if it can do this, I get the feeling that they do not handle the tcp session data, and I could do this if it was a UDP stream, but tcpreplay can not act as the external server. Did I read this wrong or is there another tool that will let me do this p  pthanks     p

Negative 2313 pIm using codeSetFileCompletionNotificationModescode API to optimize my IO completion ports loops, but it seems to not work properly. Even if I set FILESKIPCOMPLETIONPORTONSUCCESS for sockets and HANDLEs, an IO ports completion callback is still called also if codeReadFilecode codeWriteFilecode codeWSARecvcode codeWSASendcode do return emsynchronoslyem.p  pIm sure that the 3 conditions that MSDN says must be true A completion port is associated with the file handle, The file is opened for asynchronous IO, A request returns success immediately without returning ERRORPENDING are met, and are all true, so why I still receive IO completion callsp  pWhen i call codeSetFileCompletionNotificationModescode it returns success, so no errors or whatsoever, and the system is Windows 7.p  pHow I can replicate a scenario when after I have activated codeSetFileCompletionNotificationModescode on my socketHANDLEs, I can clearly see that the IO completion callback wont be calledp  pI guessed that it happens when I write few bytes on a socket, since the sockets buffer is quite bigger, I didnt full it, so another write of another few bytes shouldnt block, since there are still a lot of room in the buffer, so it should return immediately, but not with ERRORIOPENDING, just in a synchronous way, right more or less, in a similar way of unix EWOULDBLOCKEAGAIN when i call codewritecode for few bytes it returns immediately, and doesnt return EAGAIN, because there is still space in the write buffer.p  pWell it doesnt do that. Even for writing multiple times few bytes on a socket, it still calls the IO completion callback, avoding the benefits of setting FILESKIPCOMPLETIONPORTONSUCCESSp  pAm I missing something important Any clue about thatp  pNOTE I know that this wont work if the socket is only compatible with Layered Service Providers LSP that return Installable File Systems IFS handles, but thats not my case, it should work. Btw Im trying this also with pipes and files.p  pShouldnt files never call IO completion callbacks because they never block, just like in unix codereadcode and codewritecode calls on local files never returns EWOULDBLOCKEAGAIN, so codeReadFilecode and codeWriteFilecode with an handle set with FILESKIPCOMPLETIONPORTONSUCCESS should return immediatelyp

Negative 2313 pI am developing an application with several codeTextFieldcode objects that need to be updated to reflect changes in associated backend properties. The codeTextFieldcodes are not editable, only the backend may change their content.p  pAs I understand, the correct way about this is to run the heavy computation on a separate thread so as not to block the UI. I did this using codejavafx.concurrent.Taskcode and communicated a single value back to the JavaFX thread using codeupdateMessagecode, which worked well. However, I need more than one value to be updated as the backend does its crunching.p  pSince the backend values are stored as JavaFX properties, I tried simply binding them to the codetextPropertycode of each GUI element and let the bindings do the work. This doesnt work, however after running for a few moments, the codeTextFieldcodes stop updating even though the backend task is still running. No exceptions are raised.p  pI also tried using codePlatform.runLatercode to actively update the codeTextFieldcodes rather than binding. The issue here is that the coderunLatercode tasks are scheduled faster than the platform can run them, and so the GUI becomes sluggish and needs to time to catch up even after the backend task is finished.p  pI found a few questions on herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12339853loggerentriestranslatedtotheuistopsbeingupdatedwithtimeLogger entries translated to the UI stops being updated with timeap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14674274multithreadinginjavafxhangstheuiMultithreading in JavaFX hangs the UIap  pbut my issue persists.p  pIn summary I have a backend making changes to properties, and I want those changes to appear on the GUI. The backend is a genetic algorithm, so its operation is broken down into discrete generations. What I would like is for the codeTextFieldcodes to refresh at least once in between generations, even if this delays the next generation. It is more important that the GUI responds well than that the GA runs fast.p  pI can post a few code examples if I havent made the issue clear.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI managed to do it following JamesDs suggestion. To solve the issue of the backend having to wait for the console to print, I implemented a buffered console of sorts. It stores the strings to print in a codeStringBuffercode and actually appends them to the codeTextAreacode when a codeflushcode method is called. I used an AtomicBoolean to prevent the next generation from happening until the flush is complete, as it is done by a codePlatform.runLatercode runnable. Also note that this solution is emincrediblyem slow.p

Negative 2313 pI have noticed when working with some large arrays like doubles 1000 by 1000 that my program runs out of memory if I declare the array inside of main but this never seems to happen if I declare the array outside main even for larger arrays. Can someone explain what the distinction isp

Negative 2313 pI have a large application based on Dynamics CRM 2011 that in various places has code that must query for a record based upon some criteria and create it if it doesnt exist else update it.p  pAn example of the kind of thing I am talking about would be similar to thisp  precodestkbalance record  context.stkbalanceSet.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.stkkey  id ifrecord  null          record  new stkbalance     record.Id  Guid.NewGuid     record.stkvalue  100      context.AddObjectrecord  else      record.stkvalue  100      context.UpdateObjectrecord   context.SaveChanges codepre  pIn terms of CRM 2011 implementation although not strictly relevant to this question the code could be triggered from synchronous or asynchronous plugins.

Negative 2313 pWe have a lot of very small blocks that we want to include with an ESI in an Symfony2 application. To be concrete, it is about rating stars that get displayed in a list of products  and about an user avatar and rank which gets displayed in a list of comments. So we talk about very small pieces of information for list items. A part of the question is also that those small blocks do not need an URL, but to render them as ESI i need to give them an URL. Is it an design flaw to do this, because for me, making those block public available with an URL feels like an design flaw.p

Negative 2313 pI have a MVC project where I use bootsrap. p  pI need a horizontal menu of links that slides that slides with the arrows on right and left a carousel but not for images for links. p  pTo be more specific it needs to be responsive, showing as many items as it can fit to screen of the device,  it needs to take the string length into consideration because the links that will be displayed in the menu is managed by users.  I have tried using bootstrap carousel that doesnt show more than one item at a time I have checked flexisel, and I managed to create the menu, but this solution is not checking the string length, so if a user adds long  text to one of the options, it breaks. p  pAnybody knows a good solution, libraryp

Negative 2313 h1Backgroundh1  pIve created a graph database using the strongNetworkxstrong package for about 80,000 nodes and 230,000 edges. Each node in the database represents register and the edge represents the dependencies between the registers. The goal of the analysis is to determine the impact of removing a subset of nodes with respect to the dependencies for a defined degree cutoff current set to 3.  p  pMy approach has been to populate the graph database i.e. The 80k nodes and 230k edges see stronggstrong in the below code, then iterate through the subset of nodes which represent a list of registered designated for removal see strongallregisteredtoberemovedstrong using the strongsinglesourceshortestpathstrong method. The method then generates lists of paths detailing all of the effected dependandants see strongalldependantpathsstrong . This list is used to populate a new graph database see strongimpactgraphstrong.p  h1Problemh1  pFrom what I can tell, this approach works for a handful of paths, but quickly falls apart. As it generates an error, quite often the error is triggered for a different node.

Negative 2313 pI have a custom class named MyImage inherit from UIImage. Now I have a UIImage object, is there any ways to convert it into a MyImage objectp  hr  pUpdatep  pSorry for being unclear.p  pI cannot use a category because I need to add new properties to my class.p  pWhat I want to accomplish is to just let my MyImage object point to the original UIImage object.p  hr  pUpdate 2p  pI  tried something like thisp  precode MyImageinitWithUIImageUIImage image      if self  [super init]          self  image          return self  codepre  pObvious it does not work.p  pAlso, since UIImage does not have a method named initWithImageUIImage, I cannot write something likep  precodemyImage  [[MyImage alloc] initWithImageuiImage] codepre  pI also triedp  precodeself  [image copy] codepre  pBut the return value is still a UIImage object, not a MyImage object.p  hr  pUpdate 3p  pIn MyImage, I need to add 3 properties url, width, and height. Since I am writing a instant messaging app, and when receiving a new image message, I only have its url, width, and height. Then I assign those to a MyImage object, and download the image in the background.p  pNow given an original UIImage A, I want to create a new MyImage object B, which points to the same image as A, but with those new properties unassigned. Then I manually assign url, width, and height to B.p  pto rmaddy, could you tell me how to write the method p  precode[[MyImage alloc] initWithImageUIImage] codepre  pp  pOne way I can come up is first convert the UIImage object to NSData, then use p  precode[MyImage imageWithData] codepre  pIs there a better wayp
Negative 2313 pIve written a function that interprets serial data CAN and currently returns a float.

Negative 2313 pDuring a transition or animation which scales an element using codetransformcode, Chrome and perhaps other browsers abruptly change the way they interpolate image pixels.p  pBefore and after the transition, Chrome uses a high quality interpolation that looks smooth, while preserving sharpness. But during the animation, it abruptly switches to a lowerquality algorithm that makes the image look slightly blurred, which is presumably an optimisation to keep the framerate high.p  pIn my case, this abrupt switch is obvious and undesirable. strongCan I use css to request that the browser doesnt do this optimisationstrong p  pThe css property codeimagerenderingcode doesnt seem to have any property to force highquality rendering the default, codeautocode, is the only high quality setting. Firefox has an codeoptimizeQualitycode setting which is probably what I want, but this isnt supported by webkitblink.p  pIdeally, Im looking for a solution with good coverage of modern browsers, although IE9era browsers can miss out.p

Negative 2313 pstrongContextstrongp  pWe have a web application written in codeJava EEcode on codeGlassfishcode  codeMySQLcode with JDBC for storage  codeXMPPcode connection for GCM CCS upstream messaging  codeQuartzcode scheduler library. Those are the main components of the app.p  pWere wrapping up our app development stage and were trying to figure out the best option for deploying it, considering future scalability, both in number of users and their geographical location ex, multiple VMS on multiple continents, if needed. Currently were using a single VM instance from DigitalOcean for both the application server strongandstrong the MySQL server, which we can then scale up with some effort not much, but probably more than GAE.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  p1 From what I understood, codeCloud SQLcode is replicated in multiple datacenters across the world, thus storagewise, the geographical scalability is assured. So this is a bonus. However, we would need to update the DB interaction code in the app to make use of codeCloud SQLcode structure, thus being lockedin to their platform. Has this been a problem for you  I havent looked at their DB interaction code yet, so I might be off on this onep  p2 Do GAE instances work pretty much like a normal VM would  Are there any differences regarding this aspect  Ive understood the autoscaling capability, but how are they geographically scalable  Do you have to select a datacenter location for each individual instance  Or how can you achieve multiple worldwide instance locations as codeCloud SQLcode does right out of the box p  p3 How would the codeXMPP connectioncode fare with multiple instances  Considering each instance is a separate VM, that means each instance will have a unique codeXMPP connectioncode to the GCM CCS server. That would cause multiple problems, ex if more than 10 instances are being opened, then the 10 simultaneous XMPP connections limit cap will be hit.p  p4 How would the codeQuartzcode scheduler fare with the instances  Right now were saving the scheduled jobs in the MySQL database and scheduling them at each server start. If there are multiple instances, that means the jobs will be scheduled on each instance so if there are multiple instances, the jobs will be scheduled multiple times. We wouldnt want that.p  pSo, if indeed problems 3 amp 4 are like I described, what would be the solution to those 2 problems  Having a strongsinglestrong instance for the codeXMPP connectioncode as well as a strongsinglestrong instance for the codeQuartzcode scheduler p

My question is how to cause my custom operator to be used without the cast.p  pAs an example first I define a domain and a table column of that type.  For this example, the type requires its values to be three uppercase letters codeAcode, codeBcode or codeCcode, and the equality operator will cause queries to match regardless of case.p  precodeCREATE domain mydomain as char3 checkVALUE similar to [AC]3 CREATE TABLE mytable val mydomain INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ABC codepre  pThe type of the column is codemydomaincodep  precodesandboxgt d mytable     Table public.mytable  Column    Type     Modifiers    val     mydomain   codepre  pBefore defining the custom equality operator, casesensitive queries work as I expect.

Ive also tried codeanyelementcode, but that does not work even with a cast.p

How can I get the views to resize at the click of the button Any help is welcome.p  pThanks to timothykc and others, I have successfully navigated the problem stated above. But I am facing another issue now.When I change the orientation of the simulator to landscape, the paintView remains almost hidden. Following is the code toggle is a boolean value that decides whether to stretchshrink the viewsp  precodeIBActiondetailBtnClickidsender            ifself.toggle  FALSE                      self.topViewHeightConstraint.constant  0.7self.bounds.frame.size.height             self.heightconstraintPaintView.constant  0.3self.bounds.frame.size.height              [self.view layoutIfNeeded]                  else                      self.topViewHeightConstraint.constant  self.view.bounds.size.height             self.heightconstraintPaintView.constant  0             [self.view layoutIfNeeded]                self.toggle  self.toggle    codepre  pThe topViewHeightConstraint has been added as a property as indicated by timothykc. This is working properly for the portrait orientation, but is not working properly for landscape, as the height of the topView does not change as desired70, meaning that the ratios are not getting handled properly.p

Negative 2313 pHaving read a lot of different things and not being totally familiar with the correct terms for some of these things, I am wondering what the correct way is for creating threads emat time of tomcat startupem that have a emspecific purposeem.  I am using a linux system.p  pI am not trying to create a thread from a servlet, and I have a good idea of why this is bad.  When tomcat starts up, I want two different threads that have a distinct purpose to start.  The first thread runs on a period, every 30 minutes, to audit backend data.  The second thread is responsible for sending emails.  When a request runs a servlet where an email must be sent, instead of holding up the servlet waiting for the email to be sent, I want to send a request to this email thread and move on.  So one runs periodically, and one runs on demand.  I never need to increase the number of threads performing these tasks, I just need these two going, and for it to be going as long as the webapp is running, and if the webapp has to halt, I dont really care about graceful shutdown.p  pThere are a few approaches I know that I could takep  ol lipCreate a process running emoutsideem of tomcat and define a way to communicate with that process from my servlet. Id like to avoid this if possible, because Id like for these two threads to first be directly associated with start up and shut down of the webapp, and for them to be able to access data in the codeServletContextcode, and to not have to serdes data across a communication channel.pli lipSpawn two threads in the codeinitcode method of one of my servlets.  This seems dirty and hackish, but it would definitely get the job done.pli lipCreate a codeServletContextListenercode that extends a codeThreadPoolExecutorcode or other codeExexutorServicecode.  This seems appealing and correct, and I suppose I could do a fixed thread pool of 2 threads because I dont need any more.  But is this the recommended way to do what I am trying  I understand that an codeExecutorServicecode is really more meant for executing codeRunnablecodes on the fly without having to lose the overhead of creating a thread.  I dont know if that is totally right, but if it is, I would not be using an executor for its meant purpose.pli ol  pMaybe there are more methods that I do not know about, or a correct way to implement one of the above.p

He will have to wait until his browser will pull the new file from the server instead of using the cached version. Obviously I assume that the user does not know when the bug fix will be pushed, when the browser will pull the new files or how to manually pull the new files without waiting for the browser.p  pI would like to read about that caching method and how I can overcome the issue I mentioned above.p

Our struct is as followsp  precodepublic struct DbKey    private short SqlId   private int IncId   public short SqlId  get  return SqlId     public int IncId  get  return IncId      public DbKeyshort SqlId, int IncId        this.SqlId  SqlId     this.IncId  IncId    codepre  pand has some other comparing methods etc. We would like to be able to call the DbSet.Find method like thisp  precodepublic Client FindClientDbKey key    Context db  new Context   Client result  db.Clients.Findkey   return result  codepre  pTo be able to do this we wrote an extension overload for this methodp  precodepublic static partial class Extensions    public static T FindltTgtthis DbSetltTgt dbset, DbKey key where T  class        return dbset.Findkey.IncId, key.SqlId     codepre  pIntellisense now tells us the Find method is overloaded, with one version accepting codeDbKey keycode as parameter, and the other, original method accepting codeparams object[] parameterscode. However, when running the code, the function will always call to the original method and never to the overloaded, since DbKey also matches the original parameters, resulting in an exception. How can we solve this problemp

Negative 2313 pMy code is meant to two create polynomials and either add, subtract or multiply them. When I run either of the options it creates both polynomials,prints out the first polynomial and then has a segmentation fault. It seems to occur between showpolys1 and the printf statement and I cant figure out why. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have spent a while reading through similiar problems but could not find any that explained it for my program.p  ppoly.hp  precodeif  definedPOLYH  define POLYH struct link    int coeff    int pow

Negative 2313 pIm building a flexible progressbar with a number of constraints. It needs to be able to contain any number of items within it, have these items all be the same width, vertically centered, support content of varying lengths, work in IE9 and above and have an icon next to them without any additional markup. codedisplay tablecellcode seemed to be the most appropriate solution for the potentially unlimited number of items inside as well as vertically aligning the text nicely, and before would take care of the icon, which would also be vertically aligned with the a hrefhttpzerosixthree.severticalalignanythingwithjust3linesofcss relnofollowtop 50 translateY50 methoda.p  pThis seemingly works fine on modern browsers, as theres nothing particularly fancy here. However, in any version of Internet Explorer, this isnt going as smoothly as Id like. If the items are of a variable height, the icons arent vertically centered on anything but the tallest element. IE9 has support for translateY and its been ages since we had difficulties with display tabletablecell. Even IE11 cant make this work.p  pa hrefhttpcodepen.iojegtnespenGgpwjZ relnofollowI have created a reduced test case on CodePen so you can see it in actionap  pHeres a screenshot of the method working perfectly in Firefox img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comixda2.png altenter image description here And failing in IE11 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comq90kX.png altenter image description herep  pI initially thought the failure was due to the height of the elements not being calculated correctly in IE, but the borders being uniform indicates that this isnt the case.p  pIf I set the list items to codedisplay inlineblockcode and manually set their widths, the icon vertically centers as expected, but Id like to retain the more flexible behavior of tablecell display, if at all possible.p  pAny insights would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 2313 pIm doing some rudimentary exploration of Shared Element Transitions in Android L.

Negative 2313 pIn a hrefhttphaacked.comarchive20141111asyncvoidmethods relnofollowthis linka is explained why you wouldnt want to use codeasync voidcode methods and a UnitTest to track them down and avoid them. All of this works perfect using codereflectioncode that scans for codeasync voidcode in all the methods.p  pBecause we recently had a bug we want to create a similar method, which will check if there are any methods in the solution containing a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd32146828vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeTask.Resultcodea call. Unfortunately we cant access a methods body as a string and see if it contains code.Resultcode or something similar. As most of you probably know, codereflectioncode uses codemetadatacode. So we can get properties, methods, methods variable types, etc., but nothing substantial, like methods variable names or code inside a method itself.p  pI know I can access the codeMSILcode as a bytearay from the methods, and I can also convert those to hexadecimal data for example with the code found in a hrefhttpdotnetcodr.com20141007examiningthemethodbodyusingreflectioninnetc relnofollowthis linka. codeMSILcode is used by external libraries to make compilable and runnable C code again even at runtime, the problem however is that you cant read the codeMSILcode.p  pSo, does anyone know a way to write a UnitTest that checks all methods in the solution and check if they call the getproperty code.Resultcode on a Task. If any of these methods exist in the solution, the UnitTest should fail, if not it succeeds. Preferably giving which methods contain this call, but this isnt a priority. If we know it fails we can search the method that calls it ourselves if needed.p  pThe reason we want to avoid codeTask.Resultcode is because we had a deadlock.

Yes, I have also added the necessary key strings in my plist file, because the app is working on my phone, but on other peoples phones I am getting this error. The only possible explanation is that Im trying to use MapKit BEFORE asking for permission, but I have checked thoroughly for that and havent found anything like that. It also isnt even showing the alert box to ask for permission.p  pIf anyone can help with these bugs, it would be greatly appreciated. I have nothing to do until then because I have already tried everything.p  pstrongEDITstrong I figured out the problem. I had the two plist keys codeNSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescriptioncode and codeNSLocationAlwaysUsageDescriptioncode ... Only one of them was slightly spelled wrong.

Negative 2313 pPlease see my code below. In for loop, in each iteration I am making an Ajax call and pushing promises into array and resolving all these promises with q.all.

Here all my Ajax call results are independent, none of these depend on others. Using the data returned from each Ajax call, I draw a chart using Angularjs C3 directives.  p  pBut the problem I am facing is delay. To draw four C3 charts I need to make four ajax calls, using q.all,  I can start drawing C3 charts only after all four Ajax calls finishes resolved or rejected. Instead what I would like to do is, the soon any one Ajax call finishes resolved or rejected, I would like to start drawing the C3 chart based on the result of that particular Ajax call. So I have used the following approach to avoid delays in queuing all the promises. p  precodeangular.forEachdashboardslayoutArray, functiondashboardslayout      dashboardData.dashletteBeansList  []     dashboardData.dashletteBeansList[0]  dashboardslayout      var promise  DashboardsDataService.getTabDetailsdashboardData      promise.thenfunctiondata           for var dashVar  0 dashVar lt data.tabDetails.length dashVar              var dashletteId  data.tabDetails[dashVar].dashletteId             var axisType  data.tabDetails[dashVar].axisType              ...   draw c3 chart ...              , functionerror          alerterror        codepre  pMy final question is, is it right approach the way I have used codepromise.thenfunction datacode inside  codeangular.forEachdashboardslayoutArray , functiondashboardslayoutcode to avoid the delays are there any potential problems in this approach I hope, I have expressed my question clearly, if not please let me know, I will try to make the plunkr. p

Negative 2313 pI recently picked up a project where I need to perform a realtime sliding FFT analysis on incoming microphone data. The environment I picked to do this in, is OpenGL and Cinder and using C.p  pThis is my first experience in audio programming and I am a little bit confused. p  pThis is what I am trying to achieve in my OpenGL applicationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaxyza.png altenter image description herep  pSo in every frame, theres a part of the incoming data. In a forloop therefore multiple passes a window of the present data will be consumed and FFT analysis will be performed on it. For next iteration of the forloop, window will advance hopsize through the data and etc. until the end of the data is reached.p  pNow this process must be contiguous. But as you can see in the figure above, as soon as my current app frame ends and when next frames data comes in, I cant pick up where I left the previous frame because data is already gone. You can see it in figure where the blue area is inbetween two frames.p  pNow you may say, pick the windowsize  hopsize in a way that this never happens but that is impossible since these parameters should left userconfigurable in my project.p  pSuggestions for this kind of processing, oriented towards C11 is also very welcomedp  pThanksp

Negative 2313 pI want my delphi application to be able to know which control currently has keyboard focus, system wide in different processes. To achieve this, I use a global CBT hook to get all of the setfocus messages. Every focus change triggers my application to check the type of the focused control by using UIAutomation framework. This works e.g. for my own delphi applications or in the delphi IDE, but if I focus edit boxes in chrome browser, I will only get the window and not the focused control. Changing focus inside of chrome window has no effect. Theres no setfocus message sent anymore.

Negative 2313 pI want to create a cuboid in 3D and set the positions of its 8 vertices. I want to be able to place my cuboid in any orientation I like. Currently I define a cuboid by the position of the centroid, and the size along the three principal axes of the cuboid. p  pI might first create a basic cuboid without any rotations. However I would then need to scale it, translate it, and rotate it and tilt it in my 3D space, and determine the new positions of the vertices. I would be grateful on some information on the rotation and tilting effects and what basic computations that I would need. I am going through through Glassners codeGraphic Gemscode and Hughess codeComputer Graphicscode but they are very terse for me to start coding anything quickly.p  pSome suggestions will be appreciated. Another question would be on the various ways I can define a cuboid. Currently it is by position of the vertices. Positioning is currently by position of centroid and the dimensions along the major axes. I use just xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax. This means that the cuboid has no rotations or any tilt. p  pAnother direction I have been taking is to use the position of the centroid and a unit vector normal to one of the faces to define the exact position of the cuboid. The unit vector would pass though the centroid and through the geometric centre on some particular face. p

Why not just use the memory layout likep  precode                 0  a                      4  b                     8 c                          codepre  p3 Ive wrote some simple code to test the differences between the linear chain derivation and multipleinheritance.   p  precodeclass A ... class B  A ... class C B ... C pc  new C B pb  NULL pb  Bpc A pa  NULL pa  Apc cout ltlt pc ltlt pb ltlt pa codepre  pIt shows that codepacode, codepbcode and codepccode have the same address.p  precodeclass A ... class B ... class C A, B ... C pc  new C B pb  NULL pb  Bpc A pa  NULL pa  Apc codepre  pNow, codepccode and codepacode have the same address, while codepbcode is some offset to codepacode and codepccode. p  pWhy the compile make these differencesp  hr  pstrongExample 3strongpage 377p  precodeclass A virtual void f class B virtual void f virtual void g class C A, B void f A pa  new C B pb  new C C pc  new C pagtf pbgtf pcgtf pcgtg codepre  p1 The first question is about codepcgtgcode which relates to the discussion in example 2. Does the compile do the following transformationp  precodepcgtg gt gF1BBcharpcdeltaB codepre  pOr we have to wait for the runtime to do thisp  p2 Bjarne wrote On entry to codeCfcode, the codethiscode pointer must point to the beginning of the codeCcode object and not to the codeBcode part. However, it is not in general known at compile time that the codeBcode pointed to by codepbcode is part of a codeCcode so the compiler cannot subtract the constant codedeltaBcode.p  pWhy we cannot know the codeBcode object pointed to by codepbcode is part of a codeCcode at the compile time Based on my understanding, codeB pb  new Ccode, codepbcode points to a created codeCcode object and codeCcode inherits from codeBcode, so a codeBcode pointer pb points to part of codeCcode.p  p3 Assume that we do not know codeBcode pointer to by codepbcode is part of a codeCcode at the compile time. So we have to store the deltaB for the runtime which is actually stored with the vtbl. So the vtbl entry now looks likep  precodestruct vtblentry      void fct     int  delta  codepre  pBjarne wrotep  precodepbgtf  call of Cf register vtblentry vt  amppbgtvtbl[indexf] vtgtfctBcharpbvtgtdelta vtgtdelta is a negative number I guess codepre  pIm totally confused here. Why B not a C in codevtgtfctBcharpbvtgtdeltacode Based on my understanding and Bjarnes introduction at the first sentence at 5.1 section an 377 page, we should pass a C as codethiscode here  p  pFollowed by the above code snippet, Bjarne continued writing  Note that the object pointer may have to be adjusted to po int to the correct subobject before looking for the member pointing to the vtbl. p  pOh, Man I totally have no idea of what Bjarne tried to say Can you help me explain it p

Negative 2313 pSo, we have a cluster of servers that run the same application. For logging, we use codelog4jcode and the codeLoggercodes used are attached to codeConsoleAppendercodes that ultimately log the data to local log files. To aggregate logs from all of these servers, I also have a codeSocketAppendercode attached to each of these loggers. A codeSimpleSocketServercode runs on another remote host configured with this codeSocketAppendercode that will consume the codeLoggingEventcodes and format them with the codePatternLayoutcode specified in the configuration file supplied to that process.p  pSince this remote server can consume only the codeLoggingEventcodes sent to it from the clients, I cannot apply a formatter before sending them across and so I cannot log the identifier of the client host that is sending the request. Ideally, I want to be able to log the IP of the client so that I can pinpoint a host with a particular issue from the logs. What is the best way to achieve thisp

This, however, gives me the warningp  blockquote   pt is accessing getDOMNode or findDOMNode inside its render. render should be a pure function of props and state.

Negative 2313 pIve got a project Im working on in C.  Ive got two char arrays.  One is a sentence and one is a word.  Ive got to iterate through the sentence array until I find a word that matches the word that was turned into an word array what Im wondering is once I find the word how do I iterate backwards through the sentence array at the point I found the word back through the same length as the word arrayp  pCode  p  precodeString wordString  Four String sentenceString  Maybe the fowl of Uruguay repeaters Four will be found char[] wordArray  wordString.ToCharArray ListltStringgt words  sentenceString.Split .ToListltstringgt This would be the part where I iterate through sentence foreach string sentence in sentArray       Here I would need to find where the string of Four and trim it and see if it equals the wordString.       if sentence.ContainswordString                At this point I would need to go back the length of wordString which happens to be four places but Im not sure how to do this.  And for each word I go back in the sentence I need to capture that in another string array.        codepre  pI dont know if Im being clear enough on this but if Im not please feel free to ask.. Thank you in advanced.  Also what this should return is fowl of Uruguay repeaters.  So basically the use case is for the number of letters in the parenthesis the logic should return the same number of words before the word in parenthesis.p

Negative 2313 pI started working on an android project in Eclipse. Now am working on  the project using Android Studio. This project includes the Proguard files  from the Eclipse configuration not the Android Studio configuration Proguard files. The files I have are ProguardProject and a project file which tells me to uncomment some line to allow Proguard on my project. I dont have the proguardrules.pro file which is the one needed to build project with proguard on studio. Ive checked other projects that I started on android studio and they all have the proguardrules.pro file. So, any advice how to enable proguard in this project that started in Eclipse and now is on Studio thanks I have just updated my Android Studio to 1.2.2 but havent run my app on my testing device yet from this new updated Android Studio.p

I dont understand the output in log and console well enough to figure out what I need to change, though, and my attempts so far have failed.p  pHere is the list of files from ..Catalinalocalhosthelpeclipsepluginsp  precodecom.ibm.icu54.1.1.v201501272100.jar com.jcraft.jsch0.1.51.v201410302000.jar javax.el2.2.0.v201303151357.jar javax.servlet3.1.0.v201410161800.jar javax.servlet.jsp2.2.0.v201112011158.jar MYAPPhelp1.9.3.jar org.apache.commons.logging1.1.1.v201101211721.jar org.apache.felix.gogo.command0.10.0.v201209301215.jar org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime0.10.0.v201209301036.jar org.apache.felix.gogo.shell0.10.0.v201212101605.jar org.apache.jasper.glassfish2.2.2.v201501141630.jar org.apache.lucene.analysis3.5.0.v201207251805.jar org.apache.lucene.core3.5.0.v201207251805.jar org.eclipse.ant.core3.4.0.v201504281928.jar org.eclipse.core.contenttype3.5.0.v201504212214.jar org.eclipse.core.expressions3.5.0.v201504212214.jar org.eclipse.core.jobs3.7.0.v201503302103.jar org.eclipse.core.net1.2.300.v201411181725.jar org.eclipse.core.runtime3.11.0.v201504051723.jar org.eclipse.core.variables3.2.800.v201308191716.jar org.eclipse.equinox.app1.3.300.v201504231356.jar org.eclipse.equinox.common3.7.0.v201504021709.jar org.eclipse.equinox.console1.1.100.v201410231406.jar org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty3.1.0.v201503231312.jar org.eclipse.equinox.http.registry1.1.300.v201304021529.jar org.eclipse.equinox.http.servlet1.2.0.v201505191816.jar org.eclipse.equinox.http.servletbridge1.0.300.v201303271442.jar org.eclipse.equinox.jsp.jasper1.0.500.v201501191358.jar org.eclipse.equinox.jsp.jasper.registry1.0.300.v201303271442.jar org.eclipse.equinox.preferences3.5.300.v201504081437.jar org.eclipse.equinox.registry3.6.0.v201503181503.jar org.eclipse.equinox.security1.2.100.v201504231356.jar org.eclipse.equinox.servletbridge.extensionbundle1.3.0.jar org.eclipse.help3.6.0.v201303261254.jar org.eclipse.help.base4.0.300.v201506032000.jar org.eclipse.help.webapp3.7.0.v201504250643.jar org.eclipse.jetty.http9.2.9.v20150224.jar org.eclipse.jetty.io9.2.9.v20150224.jar org.eclipse.jetty.security9.2.9.v20150224.jar org.eclipse.jetty.server9.2.9.v20150224.jar org.eclipse.jetty.servlet9.2.9.v20150224.jar org.eclipse.jetty.util9.2.9.v20150224.jar org.eclipse.osgi3.10.100.v201505291857.jar org.eclipse.osgi.services3.5.0.v201505192006.jar org.eclipse.update.configurator3.3.300.v201405181928.jar codepre  pwhere MYAPPhelp1.9.3.jar is the documentation plugin for my product.

Negative 2313 pIm having some issues getting elasticsearch to interpret an epoch millis timestamp field.  I have some old bro logs I want to ingest and have them be in the proper orders and spacing.  Thanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26790543logstashfiltertoconvertepochmicrosectoepochmillis3175330531753305Logstash filter to convert quotepoch.microsecquot to quotepochmillisquota Ive been able to convert the field holding the bro timestamp to the proper length of digits.  Ive also inserted a mapping into elasticsearch for that field, and it says that the type is Date with the format being the default.  However, when I go and look at the entries it still has a little t next to it instead of a little clock.  And hence I cant use it for my filter view reference in kibana.p  pAnyone have any thoughts or have dealt with this before  Unfortunately its a stand alone system so I would have to manually enter any of the configs Im using.  p  pI did try and convert my field ts back to an integer after using the method described in the link above.  So It should be a logstash integer before hitting the elasticsearch mapping.  p

Negative 2313 pI am assembling a cross compiling unit testing rig for an ARM system and running the tests on a host machine with codeqemusystemarmcode. Specifically, Im using qemu to emulate the Stellaris LM3S6965 eval board as it contains a Cortex M3 processor like my target environment. The binary run in qemu is built with GNU Tools for ARM.p  pThere is no OS involved. The test suite is run as a bare metal application with qemu in codenographiccode mode. The toolchain and the test rig itself are working fine. And the tests successfully run to completion and produce test results within qemu just fine as well.p  pThe problem is in wrapping up qemu in an automated build tool Rake in this case. Other than keyboard commands I have not yet found a good way to cause qemu to exit after the test suite runs and spits out its results. This causes the build environment to hang  rely on user intervention.p  pI have looked high and low and have found no good sources on how to accomplish a simple exit after program termination. I did find a couple suggestions of running qemu with the codenorebootcode option and then triggering a system reset from the program running in the emulator. I have tried this. It works kinda. I write the appropriate values to the emulated processors reset vector after codemaincode executes, and this does trigger a reset. After running the test suite qemu reports catching a system reset. However, it reports this as a hardware error, dumps register contents, and then exits angry error message below. While this does accomplish exiting after the test suite runs, it then breaks the automated build script due to qemu exiting with an error condition.p  precodeqemu hardware error System reset codepre  pId like to avoid hacking the insertion of keyboard commands into the build to simulate user intervention. Id also like to avoid relying on qemu exiting in an error state.p  pIt seems Im close to a clean exit but not quite there. Searching for the qemu error message above has produced no relevant documentation other than tangentially related bug reports.p  pIs there a mechanism for causing qemu to exit after codemaincode returns in a bare metal program that Im missing Will this codenorebootcode  system reset strategy work If so, what else is necessary to allow qemu to exit cleanlyp
Negative 2313 pAs part of a team project I intend to implement obstacle detection for a robot using open cv. I am now at a point where I have functional code that runs on OS X and uses my laptop camera to detect obstacles approaching it. However the robot runs iOS it is an iPad at heart and thus requires me to build for iOS. Obviously the linker now doesnt accept the OS X library files, because of architecture mismatches. So far it is set up as followsbr  1. codeusrlocallibcode added to codeLibrary Search Pathscodebr  2. codeusrlocalincludecode added to codeHeader Search Pathscodebr  3. c language dialect changed to codeC11codebr  4. Libraries added to codeOther Linker Flagscode  codelopencvcalib3dcode etc.br  5. codeValid Architecturescode set to codei386code,codex8664codep  pIn order to perform the necessary modifications for iOS I first of all changed the valid architectures to codearmv7code, codearmv7scode, and codearm64code. Then I attempted to follow the instructions on a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsintroductioniosinstalliosinstall.html relnofollowOpenCVInstallation in iOSa, asking me to execute the codeopencvplatformsiosbuildframework.pycode script. This built a framework file and a folder codebuildcode. I added the framework file to my Xcode project via codeBuild Phasescode  codeLink Binary With Libraries.code According to the python scripts codereadmecode The script builds OpenCV.framework for iOS. The built framework is universal, it can be used to build app and run it on either iOS simulator or real device. However when I try to build the product for iOS simulator amongst others, I get uncountable codeUndefined symbols for architecture x8664code linker errors. As far as I am aware there is nothing else to the installation instructions linked above though.p  pAm I missing something here Adjusting headerlibrary search paths to include either nothing or the OS X OpenCV library files from codeusrlocallibcode was to no avail. My intuition is that is has something to do with the folder codebuildcode created by the python script alongside the codeopencv2.frameworkcode file. The contents of codebuildcode are the foldersbr iPhoneOSarm64br iPhoneOSarmv7br iPhoneOSarmv7sbr iPhoneSimulatori386br iPhoneSimulatorx8664  p  pThese in turn are comprised of  p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comMw5oU.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMw5oU.png altenter image description hereap  pDo I need to link any part of these folders into my project  p  pI am grateful for any advice.  p  pWarm regards,br Markp  pEDIT Here are the linker errors I get when compiling for iOS simulator. When compiling for another architecture x for example armv7 I get the exact same errors, differing only in the line codeUndefined symbols for architecture xcode.  p  blockquote   pLd   UsersschuegrafmDocumentsSS15CooperativeRobotsSDKDoubleBasicHelloWorldbuildDoubleIRL.buildDebugiphonesimulatorDoubleIRL.buildObjectsnormalx8664DoubleIRL   normal x8664       cd UsersschuegrafmDocumentsSS15CooperativeRobotsDouble IRL ProjectDoubleIRL       export IPHONEOSDEPLOYMENTTARGET6.0       export PATHApplicationsXcode.appContentsDeveloperPlatformsiPhoneSimulator.platformDeveloperusrbinApplicationsXcode.appContentsDeveloperusrbinusrbinbinusrsbinsbin       ApplicationsXcode.appContentsDeveloperToolchainsXcodeDefault.xctoolchainusrbinclang   arch x8664 isysroot ApplicationsXcode.appContentsDeveloperPlatformsiPhoneSimulator.platformDeveloperSDKsiPhoneSimulator8.4.sdk   LUsersschuegrafmDocumentsSS15CooperativeRobotsSDKDoubleBasicHelloWorldbuildDebugiphonesimulator   FUsersschuegrafmDocumentsSS15CooperativeRobotsSDKDoubleBasicHelloWorldbuildDebugiphonesimulator   FUsersschuegrafmDocumentsSS15CooperativeRobotsDouble IRL ProjectDoubleIRL..

Negative 2313 pI would like to ask, I understand that AngularUIs modal consist of 2 controllers 1 is the default controller that I use to process data and the other one is to handle modelInstances, which is fine for me. But what I wanted to do is I have several scopes that I will be using while renderingediting data in my modal display. Instead of resolving all these scope between controllers what i tried to do is to merge both controllers together so the scopes can be shared among the webpages. Noted that its a realtime scope What I did is like below p  precodeangular.moduleapp, [ngAnimate, ui.bootstrap] angular.moduleapp.controllerModelCtrl, function scope, modal, modalInstance     scope.items  [item1, item2, item3]   I have a few more scopes to be used in the model    scope.open  function size       var modalInstance  modal.open       animation true,       templateUrl myModalContent.html,       controller ModelCtrl,       size lg,       resolve          items function             return scope.items                           modalInstance.result.thenfunction        , function               scope.ok  function       modalInstance.closescope.selected.item       scope.cancel  function       modalInstance.dismisscancel     codepre  pIve combined both controller into one, and inject the relevant modules back so it would work, theoretically. But instead what Ive got is an error saying code[injectorunpr] Unknown provider modalInstanceProvider lt modalInstance lt ModelCtrlcode. Understand from this error which mean I have injected an unknown provider codemodalInstanceProvidercode so Ive tried to remove the modalInstance from the modules, the Modal managed to open but the the action for codeclosecode and codedismisscode throws me an error of codemodalInstance is not definedcode. What have i done wrong and how should i combine both controllers instead of separating them into 2 p  phere is the a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit7jpKT99UksJ7dbHhgpDp relnofollowplunkra link so you can understand what i mean. thank you.p

Negative 2313 pI would like to create a webapp where I can display my own geotiffs, with NDVI and other data layers, as well as 3D geometries, providing a seamless rendering of both 2D tiles and textured 3D shapes, exactly like maps.google.com achieves in switching from map to earth views.p  pAfter much research, the closest I came to a viable solution is to build the infrastructure from the ground up based on a hrefhttpcesiumjs.org relnofollowhttpcesiumjs.orga, and while this seems doable, it is extremely low level, and will require an exotic cocktail of libraries and a buttload of manhours.p  pBefore going down that road, I want to make sure there isnt a cost effective alternative that takes all the heavy lifting out of my apps shoulders and gives me a friendly set of APIs to base my app on.p  pMapbox comes close to perfection in this regard, but unfortunately, it only handles 2D.p  pOn the other hand, on the Google side, amid Earth API and Maps Engine deprecation, its hard to tell what exactly is currently possible and will remain available long term.p  pBottom line, for a futureproof Googlecentric solution built today, are there Google APIs in place that allow building a webapp that displays custom 2D and 3D data with a seamless rendering experiencep
