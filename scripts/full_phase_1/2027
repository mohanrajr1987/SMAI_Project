Positive 2027 pI am writing a program that is to convert infix to postfix and calculate the expression. For conversion I am using a linklist stack. The one problem I am having with the project is the fact that the stack heads can only be declared locally. The stack heads are a pointer to my stack struct that point to the first value in the link list stack. My linked list stack struct is globally declared.p  pSo for example,p  precodeint evaluateparam1,param2 declare my 1st stack head here declare my 2nd stack head here.  codepre  pI am using 2 stacks, 1 for value inputs and 1 for the characteroperation inputs.

Positive 2027 pIve been learning how Linked Lists work,and started building an implementation in C to reinforce the concepts. It was going well until I made a function to remove all nodes. I figured out a solution which is the commented code but I cant seem to figure out why the other code didnt work. p  pThe Node object is an instance of a class that was created using new. Therefore delete is used to, well, delete it.p  pI thought it may have been related to deleting the object and reusing the pointer variable. Then I came across this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23621677whathappenstothepointeritselfafterdeleteWhat happens to a pointer itself after deletea  Ive been staring at it for a while trying to figure out what it could be, and nothing I have researched seems to be providing an answer. p  pI dont believe it is something with my implementation so far because the programs works as expected when replacing the code with the solution code. p  pThe code outputs every address, but it doesnt seem to actually delete the object. If I run the program in Windows, the program will actually lock and never leave the while loop. Not an infinite loop, it just gets stuck and the function never finishes. If I run it on C4Droid the program doesnt lock, but the nodes still exist after the function exits. p  pSo my question is, why doesnt the current code work Ignore the commented code. That is a working solution.

Right p  pSecond codeob2  ob1.incrementcode When we do this part codeob1.incrementcode Then method increment create new object called codeprivremenicode and return the reference of object codeprivremenicode and assign it to codeob2code  p  pThird codeob2  ob2.incrementcode We call again method codeincrementcode and it will increment again. So will codeob2code have the same reference as first time when we called codeincrementcode method or it will get new reference as we create new object again p  pI think i might have problem with understanding this because i still got some problems to understand part when we pass reference by value and i think that this part is really important in here.p  pIf you could give me some more examples of this code to help me understand this i would be grateful.p

After this code I can call the C method in the C library whenever I want without any problems but Im not sure if this is okay.p  pWhen using pointers for variables stored in heap in C, the keyword fixed must be used due to GC. Because the stack section of memory contains methods, it makes sense for me to write code like above. But because I havent seen people write that way yet, I hope to hear your opinions.p  pThis is a very simple question, but a very important question to me. I dont want to write unsafe code.p

Positive 2027 pSo the question I have is very similar to this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32663989howdoyousorttwoarraysexactlythesameHow do you sort two arrays exactly the samea, except instead of having an array I use pointers. At the time of sorting, I do know the amount of elements in the arrays. p  pBasically, I just want an option thats better than copying everything from my pointerarray into a new array simply so I can use the solutions in the above thread, because that feels like a hackfix rather than a proper solution. Perhaps its possible to make an array with a fixed size from the pointer without having to copy all the elementsp

Positive 2027 pSo, as someone who is fairly new to C, I came across my first SIGSEGV Error.  It appeared in a short C  program that is meant to be a guess the number game. It consists of a selfdefined function that compares two numbers and a dowhile loop with an input inside it. The start and the dowhile loopp  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt  int checkNumint num1, int num2 See below for explanation  int mainvoid      int input0, rand3 Random number has fixed value for testing      do          printfEnter number from 010  There is not actual range yet         scanfd,input Get input      whilecheckNuminput, rand Checks if difference  0  codepre  pThe function for comparingp  precodeFunction for comparing input with random number int checkNumint num1,int num2  The two numbers that get compared First one input, Second one random rumber     ifnum1num2          printfCorrect.

The random number is smaller.          return num2num1 Return the difference, leads to 0 if equal  codepre  pI suspect the error to be in the function, caused by a missing use of a pointer, but as far as I understand pointers, they dont seem necessary here I dont change a single variable in the function, and the return only subtracts two values which are given I assume.p  pI hope my error isnt too stupid, and Id like to thank everyone who can help or tries to. I can post my processor values, altough I am not sure if that will help If any more information is needed for debugging, please tell mep

Positive 2027 pI want to fill an arraybased stack that takes void by default with sizet, and have the values those pointers point to match the i variable in a loop.

For context, heres part of my header file with codeifcurrgtdata  chcode towards the endp  precodeinclude ltostreamgt  class LinkedList  public         LinkedList         LinkedList          bool findchar ch private     struct node                  node             char data             node  next          node  head     node  curr     node  prev  LinkedListLinkedList  headnullptr, currnullptr, prevnullptr LinkedListnodenode  data0, nextnullptr LinkedListLinkedList      if head  head is null and so list is empty                  return nothing to delete           forcurr  head head  head isnt NULL delete curr delete first element                  curr  head   set curr to head of list             head  currgtnext   move head over to next element or make it null       bool LinkedListfindchar ch          ifhead                          forcurr  head curr ampamp currgtdata  ch curr  currgtnext                 ifcurrgtdata  ch                                          stdcout ltlt  ltlt ch ltlt  is in the list. ltlt stdendl                         return true                                  else                                          stdcout ltlt  ltlt ch ltlt  isnt in the list. ltlt stdendl                         return false                                  stdcout ltlt The list is empty ltlt stdendl                 return false                  else                          stdcout ltlt The list is empty ltlt stdendl                 return false           codepre  pI wish I could give you guys more context, but I have no idea how to fix this. I thought a char and a pointer to a char were the same type after all, Visual Studio doesnt break when the for loop checks codecurrgtdata  chcode.p

Negative 2027 pIs there a way to deploy a Java program in a format that is not reverseengineerable p  pI know how to convert my application into an executable JAR file, but I want to make sure that the code cannot be reverse engineered, or at least, not easily. p  pObfuscation of the source code doesnt count... it makes it harder to understand the code, but does not hide it.p  pA related question is ema hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions49379howtolockcompiledjavaclassestopreventdecompilationHow to lock compiled Java classes to prevent decompilationaemp  hr  pOnce Ive completed the program, I would still have access to the original source, so maintaining the application would not be the problem. If the application is distributed, I would not want any of the users to be able to decompile it. Obfuscation does not achieve this as the users would still be able to decompile it, and while they would have difficulty following the action flows, they would be able to see the code, and potentially take information out of it.p  pWhat Im concerned about is if there is any information in the code relating to remote access. There is a host to which the application connects using a userid and password provided by the user. Is there a way to hide the hosts address from the user, if that address is located inside the source codep

Negative 2027 pI am writing a text renderer for an OpenGL application.  Size, colour, font face, and antialiasing can be twiddled at run time and so multiple font faces can appear on the screen at once.  There are too many combinations to allocate one texture to each combination of string and attributes.  However, only a small subset of the entire database of strings will be on the screen at any given time.p  pThis leads me into the opportunity to create a cache for the strings that are being printed frame after frame.  It has been mandated that I use only one texture for the entire operation, as creating a cache of many textures would incur a texture swapping penalty for every different string printed from the cache.p  pSo I have before me a 2048x2048 texture, into which I can place whatever strings I can fit as they are being requested by the application for caching purposes.  I have quickly realized that tracking the free space available in a two dimensional space is not trivial.p  pI have been looking at things like Best Fit and Next fit, but those seem to be suitable for 1d spaces.p  pHow can I manage this cache texture in OpenGLp  pEdit I have since learned that this is an instance of a 2d packing problem.p

Negative 2027 pIm new to the Entity Framework and am currently experimenting with it. I created a simple database, set up the model in VS2008, and have got the code going to query the database using the EF as well as inserting new data.p  pTheres one thing that has me a little confused though. I have an entity set up in my model called Customer, and as part of the logic of my application I want to be able to create a temporary Customer object for some intermediate processing. This particular object should never actually be stored in the database. However, I noticed that as soon as I call SaveChanges the customer is saved to the database. This isnt what I want to happen. Id be quite happy to call AddCustomer on the objects I emdoem want to include  I just want to have the option to create a temporary instance for my own use.p  pI did discover I could call Detach and pass in my temporary instance, which would stop it from being persisted. However Im not sure this is the best way to do this since the temporary Customer object will have related objects, and unless I go through and detach them all I might end up in hot water.p  pIts possible Im misunderstanding something about how the EF is supposed to work, or that Im missing something obvious  Im hoping someone can set me straightp  pThanksp  pJohnp

Negative 2027 pAt my prior job of 5 years, I eventually had to leave because I was growing into the goto guy for production support and troubleshooting.

Negative 2027 pIm wondering if theres any relatively easy way to extend NHibernate to support Fs discriminated union.

Negative 2027 pIf I have an OpenGL texture, and I need to perform HSL modifications on it before rendering the texture, from what Ive heard I need a shader.  Problem is, I know nothing about shaders.  Does anyone know where I would need to lookp  pI want to write a function where I can pass in a texture and three values, a hue shift in degrees, and saturation and lightness multipliers between 0 and 2, and then have it call a shader that will apply these transformations to the texture before it renders.  The interface would look something like thisp  pcodeprocedure HSLTransformtexture GLuint hShift integer sMult, lMult GLfloatcodep  pI have no idea whats supposed to go inside the routine, though.  I understand the basic math involved in HSLRGB conversions, but I dont know how to write a shader or how to apply it.  Can someone point me in the right direction  Delphi examples preferred, but I can also read C if I have to.p
Negative 2027 pIm evaluating the front end performance of a secure SSL web app here at work and Im wondering if its possible to compress text files htmlcssjavascript over SSL.  Ive done some googling around but havent found anything specifically related to SSL.  If its possible, is it even worth the extra CPU cycles since responses are also being encrypted  Would compressing responses hurt performancep  pAlso, Im wanting to make sure were keeping the SSL connection alive so were not making SSL handshakes over and over. Im not seeing strongConnection KeepAlivestrong in the strongresponsestrong headers.  I do see KeepAlive 115 in the strongrequeststrong headers but thats only keeping the connection alive for 115 milliseconds seems like the app server is closing the connection after a single request is processed  Wouldnt you want the server to be setting that strongresponsestrong header for as long as the session inactivity timeout isp  pI understand browsers dont cache SSL content to disk so were serving the same files over and over and over on subsequent visits even though nothing has changed.  The main optimization recommendations are reducing the number of http requests, minification, moving scripts to bottom, image optimization, possible domain sharding though need to weigh the cost of another SSL handshake, things of that nature.p

This condition often occurs with resources such as database connections or file handles. Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, it may be possible to launch a denial of service attack by depleting the resource pool.p  pRecommendations  When a resource is created or allocated, the developer is responsible for properly releasing the resource as well as accounting for all potential paths of expiration or invalidation. Ensure that all code paths properly release resources.p

Negative 2027 pNormally to use codeUITableViewcode, the number of sections and rows per section are known.  But what if they arent  I want to implement a lazy search, so that I actually search for the next match when new data needs to be displayed.  Something on the lines of codedb.prepareSearchquerycode and then call something like codedb.nextSearchResultcode when it is time to display a new cell.  The search result determines if a new section is required or not search results are inherently sorted.p  pNot sure why it wasnt done this way to begin with, so that it asks for a section until no more are available or needed, and for cells in the section until no more are available or needed, instead of having to specify the totals, which implies having to finish the whole search before starting to display the first few results.p

Negative 2027 pIt is easy to understand the concept of settergetter for a simple data, an NSInteger for example.p  pIf we say NSInteger ap  pThe setter for a changes the value of a, and the getter only gets returns its value.

Lets say for example a NSMutableDatap  pIf we say NSMutableData mmymutablep  pImagine I have a setter setMyMutable and getMyMutable for this property which belongs to my object MyObject. If I do this, then I will call the getter since I get the object before appending datap  p[[MyObject getMyMutable] appendData....]p  pbut appendingData will also modify it, thus sould not it be seen as a setter action instead  Or does setter only refer to the fact of initiliazing a value which can be retained for example.p  pThere is something I must be missing in the concept.p  pThanks Apple92p

Negative 2027 pIm currently using the A pathfinding algorithm to calculate a path on an infinite grid using an UnboundedGrid in Gridworld, the AP CS case study, if that helps anyone. Everything works wonderfully, except for cases where no valid path exists because the end node is completely surrounded by walls. As expected, the algorithm continues searching infinitely, never finding the end node.p  pA possible solution to this would be to place invisible as in, the user doesnt see them but the algorithm does walls around the entire pathfinding area, making sure the start node, end node, and all the wall nodes are within these walls, with 23 spaces padding or so. Something likep  precode                                               S                                                           E                                   codepre  p...the idea being that eventually all the nodes will be added to the closedlist, the openlist will become empty, and at that point Ill know that no valid path exists.p  pDoes this seem like a reasonable solution to the problem Are there any ways in which this could potentially go wrong I understand that another solution is to simultaneously pathfind backwards from the end, but this seems like it could be potentially expensive, particularly in cases where the end node isnt so tightly enclosed.p

Negative 2027 pIm building an IRC bot in Python for fun. It is supposed to accept commands prefixed with  and act on them.

Negative 2027 pOk, To summarize what I am doing, I am part of a college group that wants to develop a turnbased, gridfield, stratagy game for the Microsoft Surface. The question I have does not involve any issues with touch based control, so dont worry about that. This game will be developed for the Surface using WPF and .NET 3.5 Framework.p  pThe games battle system will be very similar to the playstyles to popular games like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Disgaea 2, Where all units will be placed on a gridfield which will represent thier position and will also be used for the Units movement and Attack Ranges.p  pNow, Seeing as this game will be heavily based on a grid, I figured the best way to do this is to use the standard System.Windows.Controls.Grid, and Define as many Rows and Columns as needed in the XAML code.p  pExamplep  precodeltGrid BackgroundStaticResource WindowBackground xNameGridField ShowGridLinesTrue Width1024 Height768gt       ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltRowDefinition Height32gt         ltRowDefinition Height32gt         ltRowDefinition Height32gt       ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt       ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt         ltColumnDefinition Width32gt         ltColumnDefinition Width32gt         ltColumnDefinition Width32gt       ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt codepre  pThis code would create and show a 3x3 grid with each grid block being 32x32 in size.p  pNow, assume there is a fully developed class called Unit that will hold all the information to represent a Unit, including its Name and the Image that represents this unit. For sake of Arguement, assume that the units image is the correct size and format to be correctly displayed when assigned to the grid.p  pFor my teams current plan, we intend to represent all units currently on the field in an array in the C code.p  pExamplep  precodepublic Unit[,] allUnits  new Unit[3,3] codepre  pWhere the [3,3] represents the number of columns and rows the grid has defined.p  pNow, normally to assign a individual item to the grid you would have to define the item position explictly saying something like p  pGrid.Row  1 Grid.Column  1 Source  Binding Unit.Picturep  pNow I KNOW that is not correct syntax, but I really dont care for this method, and my example at least gives an idea on how it is handled.p  pSo here is my question Is there any way to directly databind my 2 Dimensional Array of Units to my Defined Grid without defining each and every element position For Example If there is a way to represent the grid itself as an array, such as GridField[1,2] would represent Grid.Row  1 Grid.Column  2 ltThat is possibly backwards, then all I would have to do is say GridField[1,2]  Unit[1,2].Picture or something similar to this.p  pIm not sure there is a way to do this, so That is why I am asking about the best way to do this.p  pTo Summarize I want to know how to Directly bind my grid to my 2 dimentional array of units, so that the grid becomes a visable represention of the units in my array. I want to know how to do this without having to explicitly define every single Grid Blocks content to point at the correct array position. I would prefer not having each unit define its position because that is the purpose of the 2 dimentional array, but if it is unavoidable so be it.p  pIm hoping there is a feasable solution to this issue, because if there isnt the next step would involve me creating my own grid, which would be a pain.p  pI apologize for any spelling errors and for the length of this question but I wanted to make myself as clear as possable.p  pThank you for your time and suggestions, FrostFlame64p

The problem I ran into is that it took 13 minutes to go through 56k  change files, which I think is ridiculously slow. average folder has upwards of a million xml files Ill probably cronjob it overnight anyways, but it is completely untestable at a reasonable pace while Im at work for things like missing files and corrupt files and such.p  pHeres hoping someone can help me make the thing faster, the xml files themselves are not too big lt1k lines and I dont need every single data tag, just some, heres my data node methodp  precodefunction dataNode entries      out        foreach entries as e          out . egtnodeValue.[ATTRIBS]         foreach egtattributes as name gt node             out . name..nodegtnodeValue           return out  codepre  pwhere entries is a DOMNodeList generated from XPath queries for the nodes I need. So the question is, what is the fastest way to go to a target data node or nodes if I have 10 keyword nodes from my XPath query then I need all of them to be printed from that function and output the nodevalue and all its attributesp  pI read a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualendomnodelist.item.php relnofollowherea that iterating through a DOMNodeList isnt constant time but I cant really use the solution given because a sibling to the node I want might be one that I dont need or need to call a different format function before I write it to file and I really dont want to run the node through a gigantic switch statement for every iteration trying to format out the data.p  pEdit Im an idiot, I had my write function inside my processing loop so every iteration it had to reopen the file I was writing to, thanks for both of your help, Im trying to learn XSLT right now as it seems very useful.p
Negative 2027 pIm having a column SelectedCustomers in the database table holding selected customers that manager is editing there details NOW. For example it can contain this string 111,222,333 which means that at this current time the manager is selected to edit customers with these ids 111,222 and 333. If another manager is trying to edit a customer that already editing by the first manager the second manager should get an error, preventing him from editing this customer. This check should hold at the sql. And lets say that checking store procedure getting a nvarchard CheckCustomers with this value  234,222,341. And because the second manager is trying to edit customer with id 222 that is already selected for editing by the first manager. The second manager will get an error message. How should the sql query should be I have already a split function.p  precodeSELECT  FROM dbo.test WHERE dbo.SplitSelectedCustomersIN CheckCustomers codepre
Negative 2027 pIn my game, I have a series of core animation running one after another within split of a second. At the end of the animations, a method is invoked to triggered animationDidStop some important logic. p  pUsually this works well. However, occasionally, specially on slower device such as iPhone 3G or iPhone 2, one of the animations is skipped or failed to start due to timing issue too much stuff running and the CPU cant catchup. I am fine with skipping animations, but the problem is, my method is not invoked either. It will be nice if such skipping can be detected. p  pAnybody knows how to detect the case when a core animation is skippedfailed to startp  pthanks.p

Negative 2027 pI have an application where, in one window, there is an NSImageView. The user should be able to drag and drop ANY FILEFOLDER not only images into the image view, so I subclassed NSImageView class to add support for those types.p  pThe reason why I chose an NSImageView instead of a normal view is because I also wanted to display an animation say an arrow pointing downwards and going up and down when the user hovers over with files ready to drop. My question is this what would be the best way most efficient, quickest, least CPU usage, etc to do thisp  pIn fact, I have already done it, but what made me ask this question is the fact that when I set the images to change at a rate below 0.02 sec it starts to lag. Here is how I did itp  pIn the NSImageView subclassp  ul lihave an ivar NSTimer animTimerli lioverride awakeFromNib, calling [super awakeFromNib] and loading the images into an array about 45 images using NSImageli liwhenever user enters with files, start animTimer with frequency  0.025 less and it lags, and a selector that sets the next image in the array called drawNextImageli liwhenever the user exits or ends the drag and drop, call [animTimer invalidate] to stop updating imagesli ul  pHere is how I set the image in the subclassp  precode voiddrawNextImage      currentImageIndex  ivar  kNumberDNDImages is a constant defined as 46     if currentImageIndex gt kNumberDNDImages  currentImageIndex  0     [super setImage [imagesArray objectAtIndex currentImageIndex]]  imagesArray is ivar  codepre  pSo, how would I do this quick enough Id like the frequency to be about 0.01 secs, but less than 0.025 lags, so that is what I have set for the moment. Oh, and my images are the correct size  or  one pixel or something and they are in .png I need the transparency  jpegs, for example, wont do it.p  h2EDITh2  pI have tried to follow NSResponders suggestion, and have updated my method to thisp  precode voiddrawNextImage      currentImageIndex     if currentImageIndex gt kNumberDNDImages  currentImageIndex  0     NSRect smallImgRect     smallImgRect.origin  NSMakePointkSmallImageWidth  currentImageIndex, [self.bigDNDImage size].height  Up left corner       smallImgRect.size  NSMakeSizekSmallImageWidth, [self.bigDNDImage size].height       Bottom left corner       NSPoint imgPoint  NSMakePoint[self bounds].size.width  kSmallImageWidth  2, 0      [bigDNDImage drawAtPoint imgPoint fromRect smallImgRect operation NSCompositeCopy fraction 1]  codepre  pI have also moved this method and the other drag and drop methods from the NSImageView subclass to an NSView subclass I already had. Everything is exactly the same, except for the superclass and this method. I also modified some constants.p  pIn my early testing of this, I got some errorwarning messages that didnt stop execution talking abou NSGraphicsContext or something. These have disappeared now, but just so you know. I have absolutely no idea why they were appearing and what they mean. If they ever appear again Ill worry about them, not now p  h2EDIT 2h2  pThis is what Im doing nowp  precode voiddrawNextImage      currentImageIndex     if currentImageIndex gt kNumberDNDImages  currentImageIndex  0     [self drawCurrentImage]   voiddrawCurrentImage      NSRect smallImgRect     smallImgRect.origin  NSMakePointkSmallImageWidth  currentImageIndex, 0  Bottom left, for sure     smallImgRect.size  NSMakeSizekSmallImageWidth, [self.bigDNDImage size].height       Bottom left as well     NSPoint imgPoint  NSMakePoint[self bounds].size.width  kSmallImageWidth  2, 0      [bigDNDImage drawAtPoint imgPoint fromRect smallImgRect operation NSCompositeCopy fraction 1]  codepre  pAnd the catch here is to call drawCurrentImage when drawRect is called see, it actually was easier to solve than I thought.p  pNow, I must say I havent tried this with the composite image, because I couldnt find a good and quick way to merge 40 images the way I wanted one next to the other. But for the ones ineterested, I modified this to do the same thing as my NSImageView subclass reading 40 images from an array and displaying them and I found no speed bump NSView is as laggy below 0.025 as NSImageView. Also I found some problems when using core animation the image is drawn in weird places instead of the place I tell her to and some warnings talking about NSGraphicsContext, which I dont know how to solve at all Im a complete noob when it comes to drawing and such with ObjectiveCs tools. So for the time being Im using NSImageView, unless I find a way to merge all those images and try it with NSView.p

Negative 2027 pIm making an app that does some real time image processing using the camera. Ive written code in Java and now Im trying to port that code over to native code to speed things up. An essential part of the Java code is to use the Color.rgb from the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidgraphicsColor.htmlrgb28int,20int,20int29 relnofollowandroid.Graphics librarya method to convert my array of pixel intensities into colorints description given by the documentation. The specific line of code isp  precodeColor.rgbpixel, pixel, pixel codepre  pwhere pixel is an integer between 0 and 255. I then use the drawBitmap method to draw this array of colorints to a canvas. Yes I realise that this results in a BampW image because that is what I need.p  pNow I need to convert the pixel intensities into colorints in my C code, and I cant use the above method as there is no library in C. Im not sure what colorints even are in the first place. If someone could describe to me what the Color.rgb method actually does to an intensity value, I could then manually code that in C. Cheers.p

Negative 2027 pI have created a site which runs numerous checks. These checks are started via a button and take a few minutes to complete basically goes off runs some data checks, writes to mysql database. I then have gridview controls bound to the mysql db and when the check is complete, page refreshes and gridviews are updated.. perfectp  pThis is all good except the fact I cant tell the user that something is happening...p  pAs soon as the button is checked, the site enters a long refresh status. I cant update any labels on the page to say that its running, etc. All labels update once the c code has completed.p  pI have tried a c background worker on server to handle the long running task in the hope that the page would return and labels would update then bind the datagrids in the background worker completes event but no joy.. Page just waits for the background worker to completep  pI have also tried just adding an update panel, adding a label inside the panel then calling the panel.update but again  this doesnt actually update until all code has exited.p  pAny nontechnical ideas All code added, much appreciated.p

Negative 2027 pIve been building a gallery for a month or so now, the layout is simple, theres a thumbnail menu on the left and a gallery preview on the right. when you click a thumbnail that has loaded it fires off a mousdown event that collapses the thumbnail area and expands the gallery preview to full size all using CSS3 transforms. so far everything works perfectly except I created an omouseover event that activates the function when you hover over a thumbnail. the function redraws the contents of the gallery preview div pics and creates three images, two are the previous image in the frame, one is the next image in the frame in the center. in the innerHTML it sets the CSS style left to either 724px or 724px depending on whether it goes forwards or backwards. then when the function that generates all this html is finished, the function in charge of monitoring the switch sets the style.left  to 0px. all this works in safari and chrome. but for some reason firefox refuses to animate the transition Ive researched this glitch for days and came up with nothing, in a different version I can get the transition to fire at the wrong time. but all that happens in firefox is a transitionless change from 724px to 0 px. heres my code snippets.p  pthis switches the thumbnail image and activates the function that transitions the imagesp  precodedocument.getElementByIdthumbid.onmouseover  function      num  parseIntthis.name     this.src  image[1][num].src     this.style.cursor  pointer     switchernum, null  codepre  pthis is the function that figures out how to switch the image, it sets a timer seen in the variable below it that accepts inputs without changing the image until the image has finished transitioningp  precodefunction switcher num, direction      if direction  left          num      else if direction  right          num           if num lt 0          num  fullcount1      else if num  fullcount          num  0           if intransit  false          drawgallerynum          document.getElementByIdphotos.style.left  0px         intransit  true         transittimer  setTimeoutintransit  false if transitnumber  null  switchertransitnumber, null transitnumber  null , 450      else          transitnumber  num        var transittimer  null var intransit  false var transitnumber  null codepre  pheres the actual element that draws the gallery the start variable becomes the left variable. then afterdrawgallery function completes itself the switcher sets the divs left to 0px which, in every browser but firefox, transitions the transformationp  precodefunction drawgallerynum      start  724     if num gt curpos       else          start  start          table  ltdiv idphotos stylepositionabsolute height470px top0px leftstartpxgt      first square drawn at an X of 0 so that the image remains the same but the drawer can slide over.     table  ltdiv idiorderarr[2][curpos] styleoverflowhidden positionabsolute top0px left724px width724px height470pxgt     if curpos lt totalloaded1          table  ltimg idicurpos srcimage.phpfieldpicsampidorderarr[2][curpos] stylebordernone positionrelative top0px left0px gt      else          table  ltdiv idiloaderorderarr[2][curpos] classloader styletop205px gtltdivgt          table  ltdivgt     table  ltdiv idiorderarr[2][curpos] styleoverflowhidden positionabsolute top0px left724px width724px height470pxgt     if curpos lt totalloaded1          table  ltimg idicurpos srcimage.phpfieldpicsampidorderarr[2][curpos] stylebordernone positionrelative top0px left0px gt      else          table  ltdiv idiloaderorderarr[2][curpos] classloader styletop205px gtltdivgt          table  ltdivgt           second square drawn at an X of either negative or positive 724 so that the image remains the same but the drawer can slide over.     table  ltdiv idiorderarr[2][num] styleoverflowhidden positionabsolute top0px left0px width724px height470pxgt     if curpos lt totalloaded1          table  ltimg idinum srcimage.phpfieldpicsampidorderarr[2][num] stylebordernone positionrelative top0px left0px gt      else          table  ltdiv idiloaderorderarr[2][num] classloader styletop205px gtltdivgt          table  ltdivgt     table  ltdivgt       document.getElementByIdpics.innerHTML  table     curpos  num  codepre

Negative 2027 pI am starting working on a project that transmits G.711 audio over Ethernet, written in C not C and running on Fedora 15. Rather than doing the smart thing and using RTP, I am using UDP to transfer the audio data. To somewhat overcome the problem of reordering of packets I have decided to use a struct in the body of each packet that looks a bit like thisp  precodestruct payload    char cc   char audiodata[160]  codepre  pThe variable cc is a continuity counter that runs from 015, and when the packet arrives at the recipient it is put into an array of these structs based upon the value of the cc. The audio output routine then loops through this array and plays the data.p  pMy question is, is this the best way to package the audio The output array will end up being twodimensional and surely it will be slow reading through each member and writing that to the output Is there a way to define a type that is 160 bytes wide that i can just write to the audio interface at the other endp  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as would links to helpful resources on ALSA which seem to be very rarep  pJoshp
Negative 2027 pLets say I have class MyClass with methods codexcode, codeycode and codezcode. Lets say codexcode calls codeycode, and codeycode calls codezcode.p  pSo everytime I test codexcode both codeycode and codezcode are called. In case of mocking the dependencies of MyClass I will have to mock the dependencies behavior inside codexcode, codeycode and codezcode.p  pSo if my tests for method codexcode are codetestXWhen1code, codetestXWhen2code and codetestXWhen3code I will have to repeat the expectations for my dependencies in each of the test methods. In the end, I have some code with the expectations for what happens inside codeycode and codezcode repeated for my three test methods. Any solution to avoid thisp  pOne of my ideas was to try to test the actual codexcode method, but mocking codeycode and codezcode. In that case my instance of codeMyClasscode should be partly a mock and partly the real codeMyClasscode. Is it possiblep  pAnother solution was to be strict about expectations in codexcode, but not about what happens in codeycode and codezcode... I think I can do that with codeNonStrictcode instead of codeMockedcode, but its not my favorite solution.p

But since Javascript has function scope rather than block scope, you have to use a selfexecuting function codefunctioncode to acheive the same effect.p  pIs there a purpose for this construct Have you ever seen anybody use it Does the spec mention it Is this just a side effect of the grammar having some sort of general rule about code blocksp

Negative 2027 pBitcoins are an anonymous encrypted digital currency. I got the idea a few months ago to encrypt a file where a spending proof of bitcoins would be required to decrypt the file. When a bitcoin is sent to a given address, it shows back in the block file distributed in the peertopeer network. The integrity of the block chain is secured by requiring a large number of computers to perform complex calculation. The proof of this calculation serves as the signature.p  pDo you think there is a way to encrypt a file in such a way that, the only way to decrypt it would be to supplyp  ol liA valid bitcoin block codeli liThis block code has a nonzero amount of bitcoin that was spent to an bitcoin address.li liThis bitcoin address is unique to the file we wish to decrypt.li ol  pThe result would be that anyone trying to brute force the file would go financially broke very quickly.

Negative 2027 pI have an ASP.NET c web application published to a server of ours. It consists of three pages, each with a form on them, sort of like a 3page login. After the third pages form is validated, it sends the user to a different site. Heres a little diagram so I can explain it betterp  pNamePage  DateOfBirthPage  IDNumberPage strongstrong OtherSitep  pThis has been working great in all of our development tests and stress tests. However, after we put it into production, occasionally when the Next button on the IDNumberPage is clicked, the user sees This page cannot be displayed with a diagnose connection problems button. When this occurs for one user, the same problem occurs for all users meaning once it happens, nobody can fully authenticate. NamePage and DateOfBirthPage always work, and when the crash occurs, the IDNumberPage link doesnt change, suggesting that the crash is occurring on this side of the application, not after it redirects to OtherSite. I have friendly HTTP errors turned off but its not showing any errors on the page. If we go into the server and restart the application, it works again.p  pThe frustrating part is that we cant replicate this error to see howwhy its occurring.p  pSome things that are noteworthyp  ul liEach page uses one query on a MS SQL server databaseli liEach page passes up to 4 Session variables only small Strings containing what was entered into the textbox form on the previous pagesli liThe session is abandoned when the final next button is clicked.li liAll resultsetsconnectionscommands are closed before redirect.li liRedirects use the overloaded version using codeResponse.RedirectsiteName, falsecodeli ul  pSorry if all of this is very vague, but the problem itself has done an oddly good job of hiding from us.

Negative 2027 pI have a system that the backend currently relies on Python. Basically it has a series of scripts that will go through a MySQL database and check for certain parameters across multiple tables and then perform actions such as send emails and text messages then amend relevant cells to say these issues were dealt with.  There is then another script that sits and listens on a port for UDP packets, unpacks them validates them and if they pass validation inserts them into the database and check to see if the data triggers any alarms will send an email and tech message. My question is am I doing this the most efficient way As I am not sure how to have a system of checking to see if the scripts are running and if not relaunch them.  All of them run infinitely 247.  Would rewriting them in Java be more stable and efficientp

Negative 2027 pI am pretty new to MVC and am having difficulties getting my application to run on my staging webserver. On my local machine and dev server it is running fine.p  pThe issue is that in my Action the User is null on staging, not on dev and local. I googled reasons why the User would be null, but everything seems covered. Strange thing is that it works perfectly on 2 servers.p  pHere is my code...p  pIn Global.asax Using PostAcquireRequestState I override the principal using a custom principal holding an object stored in Session. Hence the SessionHelper which will get the object and add it to the principal. The principal is then set to the httpcontext and thread.p  precodepublic class MvcApplication  HttpApplication      public MvcApplication              PostAcquireRequestState  new EventHandlerMvcApplicationPostAcquireRequestState           void MvcApplicationPostAcquireRequestStateobject sender, EventArgs e              if Context.User is ICSPrincipal             return          var principal  new ICSPrincipalnew GenericIdentityUser.Identity.Name, SessionHelper.UserClaims         HttpContext.Current.User  principal         Thread.CurrentPrincipal  principal           ...  codepre  pIn my controller I will retrieve the value stored in the principal. But the problem is that User is null on my staging server. It works however on my local machine and my development server. Development server and staging server are running the same version of IIS and both have MVC3 installed.p  precodepublic class HomeController  Controller     public ActionResult Index             PROBLEM User is NULL on staging server.         var userClaims  ICSPrincipalUser.UserClaims         ...      codepre  pDoes anyone have any experience with this problem and got it solved I was under the impression I could safely call User from within my Action.p  pEDIT Situation sketch on why I require SessionStorage in combination with a custom principal.p  pI use formsauthentication so the authentication is covered. However I used to store an object which held extra userdata firstname, lastname 6 properties in total into the userdata from the authentication cookie. However investigating my requests I saw that each request even for images and I know I can optimize this using a cookieless domain, but thats a next step was over 2.5KB. Therefor I switched back to just storing username in the cookie and on each request I want the data to be completed from session storage. Thats why I thought a custom principal would be great. It starts with a generic principal and once we get to the Action there is a custom principal with all the data I require coming from wherever I want in this case username from cookie added with data from session.p  pI hear you say but hey, using Session is not safe, it expires after a while. And I am well aware of this, thats why SessionHelper has ofcourse some intelligence. If the Session object is null, it will get all data required based on the authenticated users username. It than stores this data in Session so subsequent requests dont query my database.p  pI also use API communication http or named pipes and thats why I need this data in the custom principal. I cant access Session from that layer, but I can access the principal. Therefor if the principal is updated before getting to that communication everything works fine.p  pGETTING TO THE ACTUAL PROBLEMp  pThis setup described above actually works fine on multiple machines, but not on my staging server which is the same setup as my development server. Staging complaints that User is null in my action. And I dont know how thats even possible.p

The script has an array that stores the callbacks, which are then used to dispatch messages back to the client.p  pThe problem I have is that when there are multiple tornado instances, nginx uses a roundrobin  strategy. Since the callbacks are stored per instance and not maintained centrally, depending on when the request is made, it goes to one of the instances.

Here are two example solutionsp  precodeA,Z,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, or Z,A,B,D,E,F,C,G,H codepre  pstrongImportantstrong Look at array number 3 H comes before G, even though its a child of G in the fourth array. So there is not particular order of children in each array, but in the final result as shown over must have any parent before its children.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgKdat.png altHere, A, and H are independent of each other, but use common nodes.p

It is seen only if I place them in different files.p  pI can work around this by defining all methods that directly operate on the list object in the parent class and using this from the derived class. p  pBut Im still curious as to why I see the warning. Heres the workaroundp  pIn MyBaseClassp  precode    protected void addNumberToListNumber num         numbers.addnum      codepre  pand then in derived classp  precode    public void addSomething          addNumberToList25.0f      codepre  pSimilarly, all operations that manipulate the codeListcode object directly can be in the base class.p

Negative 2027 pI have a class that works as a recursive fileobserver. What it does is makes a file observer for all of the directories in a parent directory and then starts watching them. I know it works because when in debug mode, it logs all of the file changes in logcat. But when I disconnect from the debugger and restart the app, it makes the Started and Set Up logs but it doesnt catch any file changes. Is it possible that the garbage collector is cleaning up because the debugger isnt live and watching I dont think thats true because the Intentservice that runs it never dies.p  pstrongEDITstrong I changed the intentservice to a nonstopintentservice and the same thing is still happening. So the service is not getting destroyed.p  pWhat do you thinkp  pThanksp

Negative 2027 pI created a Java applet for my web page that creates an image file. I want users to be able to run the applet and create unique images, click a button, and have the image they created be saved to the web server.p  pI think I have the code down for writing the image to a URLconnection in the Java applet itself after having successfully written a file while running the applet on my system rather than the web page and saving a file to the local disk, and then altering a few things to write to a URLConnection instead of to the local disk although we shall see how that works too.p  pI am now trying to write a cgi script in perl that takes the image output from the URLConnection and writes the image to a file on my web server note I am a newbie to perl. I have found many examples of how to do something similar with simple text coming from an applet and then writing it to a text file, but I want to know how to apply the same concept to an image. Particularly, how do I read in the image Ive seen text input get read by using readSTDIN, somevariabledoes the same thing work with an image Likewise, how do I write the image file What function do I usep  pThanks for your help. I know that I am rather naive about all of this.p

Right now I have a yearbyyear anaylsis of the table GlucoseResults2, which has one Value column and one Year column and a LOT of rows.p  precodeGval2 lt read.csvGlucoseResults2.csv, sep  ,, headerT Gdist  qplotValue, binwidth10, dataGval2, geomhistogram,    mainDistribution of Glucose Levels,   xlabGlucose Levels in mgdl,   ylabFrequency Gval2Year  factorGval2Year Gdist  facetwrap  Year codepre  pThis gives me plots for 2005 through 2012. Im interested in altering the color scheme of these plots to indicate values that fall within the reference range for each year see below. So for 2005 I want the bins for values between 70 and 110 to be, say, red, whereas the bins outside that range can stay black.p  precodegt  Gref2   REFERENCELOW REFERENCEHIGH REFERENCEYEAR 1            70            110           2005 2            70            110           2006 3            70            110           2007 4            70            110           2008 5            70            110           2009 6            70            100           2010 7            70            100           2011 8            70            100           2012 codepre  pHaving only a few weeks experience in R, I really have no idea how to do this. p  pIdeally this would include labels for reference high and reference low, or something to the effect of red  within reference range, but Im not overly concerned about that. What I do want is a solution that reads the above table and selects the appropriate reference ranges based on the year of the histogram though if it comes down to it, I can enter the numbers manually.p  pThank you for reading this and for any responsesp

Negative 2027 pReally starting to enjoy KnockoutJs httpknockoutjs.com. Most of my web apps are ajax driven. The entire site is loaded and then from link to link we just change the body content via ajax calls.p  pWhen the ajax returns with new body content I can do my Knockout bindings. No problem. When I link to the next page just an ajax call with replacing the body. The Knockout buildings, I would assume are still in memory, but not really bounded because the dom has changed. A few questions on this topic.p  ol lipIf the next page does not have any Knockout on it is it really that bad to leave the knockout object sort of just lingering in memory Better yet is there a way to reset clear the knockout objectpli lipWhen I go from one page that has knockout bindings to another that has knockout bindings does just calling ko.applyBindings again clear out the old stuff and rebind the new stuff once again when I say going from one page to another I am just reloading the body with an ajax call.pli lipDoes knockout have any live bindings. Sort of like jQuerys live binding This way Knockout could be loaded up front and then not have to be reapplied from content change to content change.pli ol  pIn general I am looking for advise on how to best use knockout from page to page in an app where the browser is not refreshing from page to page. p  pThanks in advance for the help.p
Negative 2027 pIve a MKMapView as a child view of another UIView called codemainViewcode. If I transition my codemainViewcode on the yaxis withp  precode[UIView animateWithDuration0.3 delay0.0 optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveLinear animations     CGRect frame  self.mainView.frame     frame.origin.y  100.0f     self.mainView.frame  frame  completionnil] codepre  pthen the codemainViewcode and all its subviews nicely transition down the screen by 100 points, except of the MKMapView, which stays exactly at the original position.p  pSo I tried another experiment and also moved the codeframe.origin.ycode of the MKMapView, which then actual moves the map view, but not synchronized with the other views it has a slight delay.p  pAnyone an idea why that is I assume because MKMapView is not a direct codeUIViewcode subclass. Is there a way to fix this behaviorp

Negative 2027 pI have a special problem in coding a dynamic menu in Java.p  pWhat I want I want a menubar that looks for special files example addon01men.class and adds the content of this file to the menu as a new item.p  pProblem To invoke the methodeclass in the file, Ive to invoke it in the main file. But the addonclass is needed in this case, because java checks the presence of the methodeclass. So the program will not start, if addon01men.class is missing.p  pMy solutions didnt work perhaps in my fault  Reflections  Overridep  pI dont want to use dynamic classes because its necessary to compile when the program starts  because not all PCs that can run java, can compile java. p  pId be pleased when someone has a working idea.

Negative 2027 pThis question is about filtering a numpy ndarray according to some column values.p  pI have a fairly large numpy ndarray 300000, 50 and I am filtering it according to values in some specific columns.

Negative 2027 pIm trying to prepopulate the MFMailComposeViewController with an email address that has a UTF8 domain e.g. hello.com . However, when I call setToRecepients on my object, I get a message in the console that hello.com is not a valid email address and the email controller comes up with an empty To field.

Negative 2027 pstrongEDITstrong Ive provided more detail on my objectives below.p  pI am having trouble deep linking users to my site after they log in through the landing page using the Omninauth gem.p  pThe most common scenario is this a user receives an email with a deep link to the site  say www.mysite.comsuggestions15. Weve placed a Facebook login through Omniauth on the landing page, def landing page on the Authorization controller  see below. When a user tries to access any other page without being logged in they are bounced back via the authenticateuser helper method placed in the relevant controllers. authenticateuser is defined in the Application Controller see below. p  pOnce they get bounced back they click a log in with facebook button on the landing page and we create a session for the user through def authcreate. This works in the classic omniauth way, i.e. a callback from facebook which captures the session token. Now at this point I want to redirect the user to the page they were trying to get to e.g. www.mysite.comsuggestions15 but instead they only go through the default page www.mysite.comsuggestions. This is not a problem when the user is already logged in, but never works when they are logged out.  p  pYou can ignore authorize as that is a separate module confusing I know which is concerned with admin rights.

Negative 2027 pIm writing a script with many animations that occur in parallel and in different orders. A specific set of animations is used depending on what is clicked on the web page. The functions are reused and do not come in the same order every time.p  pThe issue comes when the user clicks another element without letting the first set of animation to complete. In this type of instance the script breaks and fails to function as intended. This is obviously because the progression wasnt completed and another set of animations began to be executed. p  pMy question is if there is any practice in identifying whether animations are currently being run in order to prevent another set of animation from being executed before the current set is complete.p

I hadnt really considered just disabling or removing the interface buttons as a preemptive strike. I like the idea of doing a javascript check first as well, whilst backing it up with checks on the PHP side. This would avoid me having to perform an unnecessary Ajax call if the user had already failed to reach the access level required.p

Now I wanted to just run a powershell command to connect up and run the commands then exit. This all works fine if I were using powershell from remote desktop, and the user credentials provided are correct.p  pAn example of what is being run is belowp  precodepassword  ConvertToSecureString PasswordVar AsPlainText Force credentials  NewObject System.Manager.Automation.PsCredentialUsernameVar, password etsn computername TestServer1Var Credential credentials codepre  pWhen this is called TeamCity just hangs, it has to be manually stopped or it will stay on this step on the agent forever.

I can see a codeContentEncoding gzipcode header in the response, and the file that is downloaded is about 360KB. Its a codegzipcode file, as identified by Cygwins codefilecode command.p  pHowever, when I use codegzip dcode to decompress it, I end up with a 660KB file which is, itself a gzipcompressed file, also identified by codefilecode.p  pIf I decompress emthatem file, I get back the 14MB file that I was expecting.p  pSo why is my file being compressed twicep

Negative 2027 pWhat path are the current C compilers taking to implement the C11 regular expressions libraryp  pAs I understand it, generating code which implements a deterministic finite state machine recognising a particular regular expression is the easiest way to do it but, presumably, that would imply either that the compiler itself would have to parse function calls to the library in a nonstandard way i.e. by implementing them directly or that some kind of polymorphic trickery is at play within the library code itself the kind of thing that I dont emthinkem is possible in C.p  pAre they using some alternative, smarter pure C method Seems like it would be complicatedp

Negative 2027 pI was asked a interesting question relating to datagrams and how they are fragmented, namely what is used to reassemble the original datagram. p  ul liI know the ID number in every fragment will be the same to show that they all belong to one larger datagram.li liI know the FragFlag being set to 1 means that there are more fragments on the way, however a fragment with a FragFlag of 0 means that it is the final fragment.li ul  pThere is one more thing I am missing, which I assume is that sequence numbers must also be used so that the fragments know which order they must be put back in. However if this is true that kinda confuses me because datagrams use UDP which is supposed to be unreliable and can end up losing packets in transit or send them in the wrong order. p  pBy contrast, TCP is supposed to be reliable and the best way to guarantee packets are sent in the correct order. Do things work differently here because we are dealing with datagrams instead of packets Or were sequence numbers just created to make UDP more reliable.p  pThanks for any help. p

Negative 2027 pGitHub a hrefhttpdeveloper.github.comv3activityevents relnofollowAPIa provides the feature of activity events for codeuserscode, codeorgscode and codereposcode. The APIs support a hrefhttpdeveloper.github.comv3pagination relnofollowpaginationa upto 10 pages for a total of 300 codeeventscode with 30 codeeventscode per page. Rate Limiting is achieved using codeETAGcode headers. I am trying to poll this API to get the latest activity. However this scheme is very inefficient due to the design supported by Github as mentioned. Lets say I make a request on codepage1code byp  precodehttpsapi.github.comusersmeeventsorgsmyorgpage1 codepre  pand i will get an codeETAGcode entry for this page. Now I move to the next codepage2code and dop  precodehttpsapi.github.comusersmeeventsorgsmyorgpage2 codepre  pand will get the codeETAGcode for this 2nd page. Similarly I can pull events from all 10 supported pages.p  pNow lets say that some activity was performed on my orgs Github account. Lets assume that only 1 new event occured. In this case when I codepollcode the API for codepage1code with the codeETAGcode it will return the changed page with the new codeeventcode included in it. Similarly codepollingcode on codepage2code with its previous codeETAGcode will also send the changed page. This change in codepage2code is however the event that was previously the last event of codepage1code and has now moved to the top on codepage2code. This shifttonext will happen for all the pages. There is NO way to find out the number of NEW events that took place.The only solution is to keep polling on codepage1code to get the latest codeeventscode. However this approach has a serious flaw explained belowp  pThe situation gets worse when the number of new codeeventscode between my codepollcode rounds is greater than 30max items on one page. In this case, events prior to the latest new 30 events will slip to codepage2code directly. If I only codepollcode on codepage1code i will loose these events that slipped to codepage2code. The only solution that is coming to my mind is to keep a cache of the entire events and then sweep on all pages. This is however a very inefficient and undesirable way to do it and kills the purpose of on events notification API.p  pI hope some githubdev can answer thisp

Negative 2027 pSo I am a fresh iOS developer working on an iOS drawing application that plays back user sketches using xy coordinates and timestamps.

However what I ended up with was thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEcRdG.png altenter image description herep  p.which is the exact opposite of what I want.  I guess I need to somehow get the inverse mask of the CAShapeLayer created by the CGPath of the erase event  Im not sure what the proper way to approach this would be without a lot of math that Im not familiar with.p  pThe other caveat is that this animation is tied to CADisplayLink so these drawing animations are being refreshed very often and performance is important.  Ive tried before with drawing to UIImages instead of CAShapeLayers and using kCGBlendModeClear to achieve the erase effect, but performance suffered terribly.  Thanks for any advice or insightsp

The results are that it successfully clicks on the dropdown so that a list of options are displayed and then I can see the option that I want to be clicked is highlighted, but it appears that it didnt actually click on it because the javascript action that happens when the dropdown is changed is never fired.  Ive tried multiple approaches but nothing seems to want to change the dropdown.  Any thoughtsp
Negative 2027 pI have an encoderdecoder code, it takes word dumps with whitespaces with a n in the end as input, and encodes the top 5 word occurrences in the text, and vice versa. It seems to be working as charm, but my supervisor program still gives 6 fails from 10 times. I encode the input file, then decode the encoded input file, and it works perfectly. Still dont understand whats wrong with it. Please guys I need your eyes p  pSimple encoder Find the 5 most common  at least 3 char long  words in a file, and replace them with a short code. The codes are 2 char long, and look like this 1 2...5. 1 replaces the word with the most occurrences in the text, and 5 replaces the word with the least occurrences. If two words have the same occurrence, the first in line goes first in the codelist sooner better. The rest of the words have to be untouched. In the beginning of the encoded file, the codelist have to be presented. The program has to have decoding function as well. If the input starts with a , then it have to adapt the codelist, and decode the whole file, recovering the original state. Input Two kind of input files can exist. The original input contains a maximum of 2000 words with whitespaces between, a maximum of 22 characters each word. After the last word, there is no whitespace, but a newline n. Words are made from the letters of the english alphabet, all lowercase. Non of the words contains any  sign. There are always a minimum of 5 different kind of words with at least of 3 chars. Warning If the input format equals the output format, decoding is needed of course In case of decoding, the limit of 2000 words and 22 chars max are valid morover the codelist in the beginning of the file of course. Output Fist 5 lines contain the codelist. First word is the code, next to it the word, which it is replacing. Whitespace between, newline after the replacebale word. From the 6th line, there comes the encoded text which needs decoding. Whitespaces between the words, only one newline at the end.

Negative 2027 pThis is a relatively general question that I have regarding to Android development.p  pIn the Android application, I am using SlidingMenu library. Imagine the activity I am trying to implement has a Navigation Drawer from Sliding Menu Library and action bar tabs with View Pager and contains different fragments.p  pIn order to have the navigation drawer in the activity, I had to inherit the application from codeSlidingActivitycode like thisp  precodepublic class ActivityMain extends SlidingActivity implements TabListener  codepre  pHowever, to make View Pager work in this activity, I will need to use Make a FragmentPagerAdapter instance, and if I want to use it, it requires the activity extend the codeFragment Activitycode.p  pMy Activity already extended codeSlidingActivitycode, so there is no way to extend another super class. I am not sure what will be a proper way to solve this conflict. When I was working on the Android app, I have saw some other cases that different components in one activity requires to extend from different super class. What will be the general solution to such problemp  pThank youp

Negative 2027 pIm creating a file server, where users can optionally encrypt their files, and ideally enter a password in the browser to decrypt them on the fly and download them in a chunked fashion of course, easier for PHP.  The decrypted data should never be saved to disk.p  pSo right now the user enters the password, jQuery sends a post to the download page with the password and a variable checking set to true.  The download page then returns a json object with a true or false indicating if it could decrypt the file or not, this part works fine.  p  pDepending on the response, it will either ask the user for another password if the response variable is false, or it will send out a new request with just the password and checking set to false, if the original response was true correct password.p  pPHP then responds with the first chunk of the file to be downloaded.  Issue is, Firefox never brings up a download prompt.  Evidently you cant try to download files using jquery .postp  pSo, I guess I need another way to do this client part.

Negative 2027 pIm developing an API for a project Im involved in. The API will be consumed by an Android app, an iOS app, and a desktop website. Almost all of the API is accessible only to registered users. The API allows authentication via WSSE which is great for the mobile apps, but not so great for the website. However, Im using Symfony2 to develop the API, and I have configured it to allow access to the API by both WSSE andor sessioncookie authentication multiple firewalls with common security context, if youre interested.p  pWith an APIfirst approach like this, Im concerned about things being abused. Take my signup method for example. I only want it to be used by the apps or the website. However, theres nothing to stop someone writing a simple script to hammer the API with bogus signups. Then theres the concern about CSRF. Because the API is can be accessed by a logged in user, then theres a risk that this can be exploited.p  pI dont want the API to be public, but I dont know if this is possible given that it will be used by the website. Is there anything I can do remove or reduce the risks and the vulnerability exposurep  pKind regards.p

Negative 2027 pIm familiar with how to make Spring handle multiple datasources dynamically via multiple persistenceunits and multiple entityManagerFactoryBean implementations but what Im struggling with is how to have a MySQL dialect emandem a DynamoDB dialect from within the same spring configuration, via springconfig xml files.p  pThe work pattern is as followsp  p[data POJO in, from some endpoint]  Persist POJO into DynamoDB, retrieving the UUID of that object business key as field on POJO  Persist UUID as a compound key no referential integrity, its just another column into MySQL Database [with other related mapped entities].p  pIm struggling with quite how on earth to go about adding the DynamoDB instance into the Spring configuration files to achieve this.p  pFor what its worth, the related repositories are going to be in separate packages.p  pAny starters for 10 would be gratefully received  Ive done some searching but all DynamoDB mapper frameworks seem to be at a much higher level  have I missed something here  Ive been looking at a hrefhttpsgithub.commichaellavellespringdatadynamodb relnofollowSpringData DynamoDBa but still cant make the link between the configuration file and Dynamo.p  pThanks in advance,p  pA.p  p UPDATE IN THINKING p  pI think Ive gone about this the wrong way.

Negative 2027 pInstalled Keplerbased STS 3.4.0.RELEASE current latest version and the Gradle Support package from the Dashboard Extensions. Now I would like to create a Spring MVC project from scratch that uses Gradle as its build and dependency management tool instead of Maven.p  pI start by creating a Spring Project with a Spring MVC Project Template, but apparently this is based on Maven, and there is no option in any wizard screen to switch the project to Gradle. So, after creation, I rightclick on the project and select Configure  Convert to Gradle Project. However, contrary to my expectations, the project still holds its Maven nature, dependencies in the project still belong to Maven despite Gradle having dependency resolution enabled, the codepom.xmlcode file is still there, and there is no codebuild.gradlecode file anywhere to be seen. Eclipses Console reports a successful build, which I believe comes from Gradle but based on emwhatem When I open the Gradle Tasks view, it is empty if I try to refresh it, a message saying that the model is not yet available appears, just before triggering another successful build. Then, when I try and remove the Maven nature from the project, errors start to appear, about classes and tag library descriptors that are not found anymore. I select Gradle  Refresh Dependencies from the contextual menu of the project, but it has no effect.p  pI try the other way around create a Gradle project from scratch. Unfortunately, Gradle templates do not cover Spring projects at all, and adding the Spring nature afterwards has no tangible effect, nor I am able to find a way to apply the Spring MVC Project Template to this newly created Gradle project.p  pOn the Internet, everyone talks about how powerful the import facility of the Gradle Eclipse plugin is, and how to create a Gradle project outside the IDE, then create the necessary files for Eclipse to be able to import the project, finally import it and be able to develop using the IDE. The sample project used in these tutorials is not a Spring MVC project, so I would be left on my own as the creation of the directory hierarchy and further configuration are concerned.p  pSo I wonder is such a thing as creating a Spring MVC Project with Gradle from within STS even empossibleem at this time Given that STS, Spring, and the Eclipse Gradle plugin are developed by the same vendor, you would bet it is, because it seems such a basic feature that would hardly be missing from even a first release of STSSpringGradle integration tools. So, did I miss something when trying to achieve my goal And, just in case this is not possible, are there any other means to create a Gradlebased Spring MVC project from within STS Or just properly convert a Mavenbased one to Gradlep

Negative 2027 pWhen a user downloads my app, and signs up we populate Core Data with user data, which could run into potentially thousands of objects.p  pWe also have a log out option for the user, at which time we bulk delete these objects. We do not delete the underlying sqlite stores because some of the data in there is not user specific, and wed like to retain that.p  pWhat is common across both bulk creation and deletion is that these processes take a lot of time.p  pAfter performing obvious optimizations and using the Time Profiler instrument, I reached the conclusion that the biggest bottleneck seems to be this patternp  precode voidawakeFromFetch      [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectorsomeSelector namesomeNotification objectnil]    voiddidTurnIntoFault      [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserverself]  codepre  pThis seems to be taking 6570 of all the CPU time during creation as well as deletion. Ive tried to minimize the number of objects that get unfaulted on creation, but there is a minimum number that I cannot bring down further.p  pBut for deletion, it seems an object that is marked to be deleted must be fetched, unfaulted, and then faulted again, and therefore codedidTurnIntoFaultcode is called for all objects that are deleted. I do most of the object cleanup in codedidTurnIntoFaultcode, but surprisingly, removing the object as an observer from the default NSNotificationCenter seems to be the heaviest operation by a huge margin.p  pAny ideas why removeObserver is turning out to be so heavy Any ideas on how to optimize this for faster signuplog outp

Negative 2027 pIm using jQueryUIs draggable and droppable interactions, and in my application I only want to allow a draggable to be dropped into a single drop target, ideally the target that is closest to the mouse, or the target that has the most overlap with the draggable.

When my draggable overlaps more than one drop target, Id like to set the hoverClass on only one of the drop targets, and only allow the drop on that target. Is this possible with jQueryUIp  pI like the behavior of the touch tolerance, so Id like to keep that if possible.

First I followed this tutorial a hrefhttpnutsandboltsofcakephp.com20080507jqueryautocompleteincakephp relnofollowJQuery autocomplete in CakePHPa p  pbut there was the same problem with javascript as it is now with html. Then I tried the new version of the tutorial a hrefhttpnutsandboltsofcakephp.com20130827cakephpandjqueryautocompleterevisited relnofollowCakePHP and jQuery autocomplete revisitedap  pI know the new tutorial was written for CakePHP 2.3 but I read that the functionality for jQuery should be the same for CakePHP 1.3.p  pSo the header of my view looks like thisp  precodeltphp   echo thisgtHtmlgtcsshttpscode.jquery.comui1.10.3themessmoothnessjqueryui.css gt codepre  pBut this throws the following errorp  blockquote   pNotice 8 Undefined property ViewHtml   [APPviewsproduktshow.ctp, line 5] Fatal error Call to a member   function css on a nonobjectp blockquote  pIn any case css, jquery, ... this error occurs. So it seems to me that the problem belongs to the helper. Also if I use the scriptmethod.p  pThe htmlhelper exists in my cakelibsviewshelpers folder. Also I load it in the produktcontrollerp  precodeclass ProduktController extends AppController  var helpers  array          Html,         Check,         Misc  codepre  pI have already searched here for a solution, but found no answer that fits for me. Sadly the link to cakePHP mentioned in this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8191877howtoincludejavascriptincakephp13how to include javascript in cakephp 1.3a  is somehow broken and I didnt found an answer to my problem in the cookbook for cakePHP 1.3.p  pPlease, if someone could help me to get the helper running, that would be greatp

Since there are multiple players, I want to try and have a repeating structure to efficiently use the functions I have created over and over. With the current code, it will score Players like it should up until the last player, where the code stops completely and nothing is presented. What I would like to do is get the code to repeat infinitely until the required score is gained, as in it will keep cycling through the players with no errors. I have tried multiple times with different loops but I cannot get it to work. Hopefully this is a little bit clearer to everyone. Sorry about the unorganizedunclear question, relatively new to StackOverflow.p  pEDIT Problem has been solvedp

BUT when I try to run the project from within eclipse no class from the shipped dependencies is found. When looking into the deployment assembly of the projects then how it should be all dependencies are listed in the ear project and the none of them appears in the ejb project. I had a look at the maveneclipseplugin and it does explicitly write the to deployed components to the ear project, so I think this is the way it should be. But when I manually add the classpath entries to the deployment assembly to the ejb project the application gets deployed and starts without any Problems.p  pIs this a Problem of my project setting or a maveneclipseplugin bug Does anybody had this problem himselfp  pThx for reading Markusp  pEDIT p  pI dot not use the m2eclipse plugin.p

Negative 2027 pI have searched using tag graphviz and box keyword, but have not found a solution to my problem. I am running a simple code in C using Xcode 5.1.1 and compiling with Apple LLVM 5.1 that uses both pthread.h from libpthread.dylib and gvc.h from graphviz. But when I try to build it, it says  p  pgeom.h p  pSemantic Issue  Redefinition of box as different kind of symbolp  pI dont get this issue when using those two headers separately I had a code using only graphviz, and tested some code using pthread only. I checked where this geom.h was called in types.h which is called in gvc.h. I am rather newbie in C, so would like to know if any of you know about this issue.p  pBelow is some basic code I got an example for using pthread that I wanted to test for something else EDIT just including both headers generates this issue... Ill remove the code that generates this issue I did add the header path for graphviz and library for pthread.

Negative 2027 pI sometimes run into situations where i have an enum that has a string constant associated with it and at points in the code I have to replace the enum with the string. e.g.p  pAn enum in my codep  precodetypedef enum      define weapon names     kWeaponGaussRifleType  1,     kWeaponGatlingGunType,     kWeaponSideWinderMissileType,     kWeaponLaserType  WeaponType codepre  pCommon use for that enum which is perhaps ok.p  precodevoid fireWeaponWeaponType w      switchw          ...       codepre  pPossible incorrect use of that enum which I would like to fix.p  precodevoid loadAssetWeaponType w      associate weapon filename with the weapon type     ifw  kWeaponGaussRifleType         fileName  gaussRifle.png      elseif          ...       codepre  pObviously this code above can be replaced with a switch or it could pick names from an array of strings. But it would still mean that I have to define the entity name twice once in the enum and then in the code where the translation occurs and this is thus prone to error and inconsistency in naming. p  pIs there any way in C to fix thisp

I also have to add a callback method to sourceNode.onended to make sure I get any data at all.p  pI am using codeAnalyserNode.getByteFrequencyDatabuffercode to populate my array.p  pHow can I retrieve frequency data from an audio file at a specific time, consistentlyp

Negative 2027 pGood day, all,p  pLongtime listener, firsttime poster...p  pI have a client who has been promised a seemingly very complex bit of functionality. They want to load the contents of 3 separate pages into one, after a visitor to their site successfully logs in to their account. They want this to happen without a page refresh. Ajax is the solution. I am not, however, experienced with Ajax.p  pIm having trouble figuring out how to tell when a .get command using jQuerys Ajax commands has finished loading its content. My approach is to, once the login has been successful, to go and fetch the 3 separate pages, load their XHTML content into variables, and redraw the pages. Below youll see my pseudocode. I use XXItemXX to standin for actual paths. Each resulting page that Im trying to pull in has a div with class content surrounding the data I want to retrieve. The XHTML looks like thisp  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtPage Namelttitlegt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltdiv idheadergt...ltdivgt         ltdiv classcontentgt         .         .         .         ltdivgt         ltdiv idfootergt...ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThe jQuery code Ive built follows. Im able to get the form submitted and even get the content back from the various .get commands. The problem is, I cant seem to daisychain things as I normally would. I am struggling to figure out how to only fire the jQuery commands to draw the page once all 3 have been successfully retrieved. Im afraid my biggest stumbling point is how to articulate this when searching with Google to see how others have dealt with this problem.

Negative 2027 pI have some data in a mysql database and its indexed through the solr admin app. I want to expose this data as facets in a django app. I explored ajax solr and it seems to be a very good solution for integrating solr into a web app with faceting, tags etc. I was also evaluating haystack to see if that would provide a much better solution. p  pIs there a way to integrate existing solr index with haystack  It looks like we need to create a model and populate the model and solr would index the model. But in my case, I already have the index built and just want to integrate into django through haystack. would appreciate any thoughts regarding thisp  pthanks Joe.p

Negative 2027 pIm trying to understand how to have different size UiImageViews not launch images with only one storyBoard in Xcode 6. I kind of understand the idea of one abstract storyBoard targeting different devices and understanding how good it is for UIButtons and labels etc.. but Im really confused when it comes to UIImages.p  pSurley, with all the device sizes you still need different size images for each device   p  pFor example lets say I want to have an image of a flower flower.png as a backGround on all devices. p  pSo previously, I would have 2 storyBoards  one for iPhone and one for iPad.p  pThe iphone storyBoard would display the following images iPhoneFlower.png 480 x 320 iPhoneFlower2x.png 960 x 640p  pand the iPad storyBoard would display the following images iPadFlower.png 1024 x 768 iPadFlower2x.png 2048 x 1536p  pI just cant see how you can now place an image in the large square abstract storyBoard and the then set AutoLayout and size classes to target the an image to display correctly on all devices without cropping or stretching p  pyea I know this  is probably a stupid question but because its so different to how I have previously worked, Im just not getting it. I thought about setting up a storyBoard for each device but that seems like a step backwards. p

This is however in no way consistent with a relational in terms of SQL viewtable structure that id need to analyze the data with SPSS or Excel or whatever, as there are other subobjects schools, awards, etc. which are also stupidly filled in the rows below the high level main record, but do not have a direct rowcolumn wise relationship to one another considering analysis.p  pAs i see it i would need to extract those sub object columns and rows to an own table and create some nm relationship, or at least normalize it into ONE table then of course with accepting the redundancies of the other unnested attributes of course.p  pemDoes anyone of you have an idea on how to handle this issue What i want to end up with is one consistent table to run statistical analysisclustering on certain attributes.emp  p... or is there maybe an easier way how to directly work on the json data I assume map reduce is not really an option here...p  pIm thankful for any suggestions on how to proceed.p  precode users [    id 123456abcdef,   firstname Max,   lastname Mustermann,   displayname Max Mustermann,   pagename MaxMustermann,   permalink httpswww.xing.comprofileMaxMustermann,   employmentstatus EMPLOYEE,   gender m,   birthdate      day 12,     month 8,     year 1963   ,   activeemail max.mustermannxing.com,   timezone      name EuropeCopenhagen,     utcoffset 2.0   ,   premiumservices [     SEARCH,     PRIVATEMESSAGES   ],   badges [     PREMIUM,     MODERATOR   ],   wants einen neuen Job,   haves viele tolle Skills,   interests Flitzebogen schieen and so on,   organisationmember ACM, GI,   languages      de NATIVE,     en FLUENT,     fr null,     zh BASIC   ,   privateaddress      city Hamburg,     country DE,     zipcode 20357,     street Privatstrae 1,     phone 49401234560,     fax ,     province Hamburg,     email maxmustermann.de,     mobilephone 4901551234567   ,   businessaddress      city Hamburg,     country DE,     zipcode 20357,     street Geschftsstrae 1a,     phone 49401234569,     fax 49401234561,     province Hamburg,     email max.mustermannxing.com,     mobilephone 4916066666661   ,   webprofiles      qype [       httpqype.deusersfoo     ],     google [       httpplus.google.comfoo     ],     other [       httpblog.example.org     ],     homepage [       httpexample.org,       httpotherexample.org     ]   ,   instantmessagingaccounts      skype 1122334455,     googletalk max.mustermann   ,   professionalexperience      primarycompany        id 1abcdef,       name XING AG,       title Softwareentwickler,       companysize 201500,       tag null,       url httpwww.xing.com,       careerlevel PROFESSIONALEXPERIENCED,       begindate 201001,       description null,       enddate null,       industry AEROSPACE,       formofemployment FULLTIMEEMPLOYEE,       untilnow true     ,     companies [                id 1abcdef,         name XING AG,         title Softwareentwickler,         companysize 201500,         tag null,         url httpwww.xing.com,         careerlevel PROFESSIONALEXPERIENCED,         begindate 201001,         description null,         enddate null,         industry AEROSPACE,         formofemployment FULLTIMEEMPLOYEE,         untilnow true       ,                id 24abcdef,         name Ninja Ltd.,         title DevOps,         companysize null,         tag NINJA,         url httpwww.ninjaltd.co.uk,         careerlevel null,         begindate 200904,         description null,         enddate 201007,         industry ALTERNATIVEMEDICINE,         formofemployment OWNER,         untilnow false       ,                id 45abcdef,         name null,         title Wiss.

Negative 2027 pIm twisting my brain into knots trying to understand how to combine the codeStatecode monad with codeMaybecode. p  pLets start with a concrete and intentionally trivialunnecessary example in which we use a codeStatecode monad to find the sum of a list of numbersp  precodeimport Control.Monad.State  list  [Int] list  [1,4,5,6,7,0,3,2,1]  adder  Int adder  evalState addState list  addState  State [Int] Int addState  do   ms lt get   case ms of     []     gt return 0     xxs gt put xs gtgt fmap x addState codepre  pCool.p  pNow lets modify it so that it returns a codeNothingcode if the list contains the number code0code.  In other words, codeevalState addState listcode should return codeNothingcode since codelistcode contains a code0code.  I thought it might look something like this...p  precodeaddState  State [Int] Maybe Int addState  do   ms lt get   case ms of     [] gt return Just 0     0xs gt return Nothing     xxs gt put xs gtgt fmap fmap x addState codepre  p...it works but I assume theres a better way to do this...p  pIve played around with codeStateTcode and codeMaybeTcode and I cant get them to work.  Ive looked at a couple of intros to Monad transformers but they either didnt touch on this particular combo i.e., State  Maybe or the examples were too complex for me to understand.  p  pstrongTLDRstrong Id appreciate if someone could show how to write this admittedly trivial piece of code using codeStateTcode and codeMaybeTcode two examples.  Im assuming it isnt possible to write this code without the use of transformers  is that incorrect  p  pP.S. My understanding is that codeStateTcode is probably better suited for this example, but it would be helpful conceptually to see both examples, if not too much trouble.p  pstrongUpdatestrong As pointed out by Brenton Alker, my first version of the code above doesnt work because of simple typo I was missing an apostrophe.  In the interest of focusing the question on the use of codeStateTcodecodeMaybeTcode, Im correcting the post above.  Just wanted to include this note to give context to his post.p
Negative 2027 pIm using Quartz.net to create the scheduled jobs running in the background. So far I can manage to run the jobs from program where I manually add the jobs in the source codes. In fact, what I really need is to run the jobs from the oracle database whereby my JOBSTBL database table stores all the necessary jobs with various preferencesjobcode, jobname, CRONexpression, etc. p  pI understand that JobStore feature can be used to store the data in the database but we cant store the jobs details permanently and update the jobs dynamically. Correct me if Im wrong.p  pNow my question is how can I run the jobs from my JOBSTBL table that will be changing the trigger timingCRON expression occasionally and dynamically Which kinds of methods or ways I should use Particularly, the CRON expressions for each job will be changing over the time. p  pThanksp
Negative 2027 pIve already seen several questions explaining why code0  code is codetruecode in strongJavaScriptstrong, but i have a bit deeper question.p  pSo the answer to why is code0  code is codetruecode in JavaScript is that string codecode gets converted to number, zerolength string is converted to zero number, but how this agrees with code[9.3.1 paragraph of ECMA262]httpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2625.1sec9.3.1code which says that string should be parsed using given formal grammar and if it fails, then such string is converted to codeNaNcode. When i looked on this spec i thought that codecode is not a string numeric literal and it should be parsed as codeNaNcode and codeNaNcode is not equal to code0.0code.p  pSo why above speculation isnt correct and code0  code is actually codetruecodep  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 2027 pI want to capture every mouse event and I tried to add event listeners to FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication. However there are some cases like Flexs Menu class when the clicks arent captured  probably somewhere the event propagation is stopped. For example in SystemManager.as I found thisp  precode addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, mouseEventHandler, true, 1000 codepre  p...which seems to override my listener. Also I tried to add Listeners with priority int.MAXVALUE but with no success.p  pSo my question is  how can I capture all mouse clicks, without worrying about my events being stopped somewhere Maybe some javascript hack Or maybe to add the event listeners somewhere where there is no chance for them to be canceled Thanks.p
Negative 2027 pI think I understand the main difference between stack and heap.p  pIn the following program, an Object of size n is created on the heap. A pointer p refering to this sofar nameless object is created on the stack, where it occupies 4 bytes at least on my system. If I understood well, as references do not use extra memory, no further memory is allocated except maybe for the int returned by main on the stack.  p  precodeClass Object   n bytes  int main      Object p  new Object     Objectamp r  p      ...  codepre  pStill, the memory management is not fully clear yetp  p1 where are the names p and r stored They are both local names, so I suppose they should also go on the stack Does this not require extra memory to store the binding between a variable name and the part of memory it refers top  p2 where is the type of the pointer stored The pointer occupies only 4 bytes on the stack, which I think is the exact size to store a memory address. How does the computer know which type can be found at that addressp  p3 similarly to 2, the Object on the heap needs n bytes of storage and the only direct reference to it 0 bytes. Where is the type of this object stored, so when r is used, it knows which type it isp  p4 I understood that the compiled program also resides in memory somewhere to guide execution of it. Is this on the stack or the heap, or is this still another part of the memory p
Negative 2027 pI have a very specific requirement, where in I have to provide a reordering functionality of checkbox buttons within the Column Visuals extension of JQuery Datatable 1.10.4. This is a IE 8 specific implementation and my application utilizes AngularJS 1.2.2. the JQ datatable has been implemented as a ECA directive. The existing colVIS extension with IE 8 is slow and crashes most of the times along with save state option. p  pTherefore I was thinking of implementing the Column VIS functionality entirely on my own utilzing jquery ui 1.11 sortable which can probably have a group of check box buttons that can be sorted  reordered. The requirement is to have two sections. the upper section is to have a default set of selected  checked check box buttons which can be reordered and the lower section is to have a set of un checked check box buttons sorted in an alphabetical order. p  pUser Actions p  pWhen the user checks an unchecked button from the lower section. it immediately moves to the upper section and can be reordered by the customer. p  pWhen the user unchecks the checked button from the above section. it immediately moves to the lower section and is re arranged alphabetically.p  pThere is also a restore button within which defaultizes the state to the original state of having a preselection of checked check box button set on the upper section.p  pBack end p  pEvery button has a Text and an index number e.g. 43, 0, 16 etc. which is stored in an array and fed as aTargets to the JQuery Datatable. every and any user interaction with this layout will update the number of elements that is the index number into this array and their sequence in this array. p  pIs this achievable with Jquery UI 1.11 Sortable Widget Library. If so then some code in this direction would be very useful. Should I be developing this feature as an Angular Directive. or a simple pop up div on the requisite view of the controller p  pThanks and Regardsp

This session handler is built inhouse and not using PHPs core session handler.p  pWhen using a fresh install of Google Chrome on uptodate Windows 8.1, upon visiting the URL, I receive an Error 404 page. When I run this in Incognito Mode, it works properly.p  pOn a couple occasions where I have gotten it to work in some way, refreshing the page or using the Back button, then navigating further loses my cookies in Chrome and forces to login again, which brings me back to an Error 404 page.p  pAdditionally, other browsers have been tested with Firefox and IE 11  and it also works properly.p  pLastly, I have had another person test this on their own machine through Chrome, and they achieve the same results fails on normal tab, passes in Incognito mode.p  pI would be happy to show you guys the code if I was allowed to, but unfortunately rules above my own authority allow me too. Has anyone ever ran into a similar issue with Google Chromep  pI am open to any suggestions. There are no extensions installed at this point on Google Chrome.p  pThank you for any help you can provide.p  h2[EDIT] Update to Issueh2  pI have managed to narrow this down to cURL returning codecURL error 35 SSL connect errorcode which causes my system to spit out an Error 404 page  but my issue extends beyond that considering this is only happening in Google Chrome in normal mode. How could this possibly effect PHPs cURL abilities, being that it is serverside and completely detached from the browser itself at this levelp  pI dug into my setting on Google Chrome, and found that Predict network actions to improve page load performance was strongenabledstrong. Upon disabling this setting, I am no longer receiving this issue.p  pCan anyone elaborate why this enabled setting would be causing this issue in Google Chromep

Negative 2027 pI have server side tables user and usercurrency.p  pIn my front end iOS application, I desire to be able to retrieve the users current currency inapp currency amount in various area of the application. For example, it will be displayed on nearly every view in the application, showing them how much they currently have. It will also be used when performing an action that requires currency.p  pHow should this best be set upp  pA Lets say we only have a method called fetchUserCurrencyWithCompletion. This method will fetch the data from the server asynchronously, and then the caller will need to provide some code in the completion block on what to do with it. There is a problem with this. If every view in the app is displaying the users currency amount, to have to wait until the asynch is done, would cause some screenview flicker everytime, as the view would load first and then some time later the currency would display.p  pB Implement a cache in fetchUserCurrencyWithCompletion. instead of void, make it NSNumber fetchUserCurrencyWithCompletion. The immediate return NSNumber value will contain the cached currency value. Then once again, after the asynch fetch is run, the callers completion code will be run, and they can update their usage of currency accordingly. This will only cause screen flicker for the currency amount being displayed, when the fetchedResult is different from the cache. Which shouldnt be often. If there was another client using this server, say a website, then the user on the website could spend 5 currency, and the iOS app would originally pull in 15 currency total via the cache, and then update to 10 once the server fetch is complete. But I have no other client. Just the iOS app. So this should never happen. p  pThen, when an area of the application is going to perform an action that requires currency, it would use fetchUserCurrencyWithCompletion, and wait for completion to get the server result to ensure that the user had enough currency to perform the action.p  pIs this a good way of designing this Im still quite new, and not sure the best way of doing this.p

Negative 2027 pI am reading about the specific guidelines that needs to be followed while creating Immutable Class in a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkarticlesjavablocheffective08qa140880.html relnofollowemEffective Javaema. p  pI read that In Immutable class method should not allowed to be overridden otherwise overridden method may change the behaviour of method. Following are the design approaches available in java to solve this problem  p  ol lipWe can mark class final but as per my understanding, it has a one disadvantage that it makes the class inextensible.pli lipSecondly is to make individual methods final but I can not get other disadvantage besides that we need to individually mark each method as final in order to prevent overridding.pli lipAs per book,better approach is to make the constructor private or packageprivate and provide public static factory method for creating object. pli ol  pMy question is Even if we include private or default constructor in the class, it cannot be extended anymore in same package in other package in case of packageprivate constructor, it has a same problem which the first one had. How is it considered as the better approach than the previous onesp

I guess the general strategy of CUDA programming isp  ul liallocate and copy memory from RAM to cuda using cudaMalloc and cudaMemCpyli lidivide the workload among blocks and threads in such a way that the memory accessed by different blocks doesnt overlap much.li liIf there is overlap between the memory used by blocks, start each block by copying the memory inside a strongsharedstrong array.

Negative 2027 pImagine the next scenario a user wants to register to a webpage and fills a form. While he is filling the form, jQuery keeps checking through a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRegularexpression relnofollowregular expressiona if fields are valid, etc...p  pTaking the email as the primary key which the user will use after registering to login, the email field needs to be checked with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAjax28programming29 relnofollowAjaxa to let the user know if that email is registered or not. I want to check it with Ajax to avoid sending the full form and emptying it, refreshing page, etc...p  pSo, when the user has ended filling the email field, the Ajax request is sent to the server, something like the next linkp  precodeexample.comcheck.phpemailabcdefggmail.com codepre  pWhen check.php receives the email, it asks the database if it exists or not and returns a message like codeUser already existscode if user exists or codenullcode if user does not exist.p  pstrongThe question isstrong if someone digs through my .js and finds out links similar to that, they could use that link to send a large number of requests to find out if those random emails exist. This could lead to heavy use of the database or in the worst cases even crashing and private information leaks.p  pSomeone could do a huge for loop to check emails likep  precodeGetting the response of the next links example.comcheck.phpemailaaaaaaagmail.com  Returns null example.comcheck.phpemailaaaaaabgmail.com  Returns null example.comcheck.phpemailaaaaaacgmail.com  Returns null example.comcheck.phpemailaaaaaadgmail.com  Returns User already exists codepre  pstrongstrong    p  pstrongSince i last accepted the answer, i kept investigating this and found the solution to avoid this behaviour. The following code is for JAVA but the logic can be applied to any other serverside language.strongp  pBefore doing ANY ajax request to the server, I request a token to the server. This token looks like this codefmf5p81m6e56n4va3nkfu2ns8ncode it is made by a simple method, it can, however, be more complex, but this is good to go. p  precodepublic String getToken throws UnsupportedEncodingException      return new BigInteger130, new SecureRandom.toString32  codepre  pWhen requesting the token, the server does not only return the token, but also a small script that in case someone uses browser to inspect element and browser navbar and such the script will run and the token will be cleared. Servlet returns something like thisp  precodehtml  ltheadgt      ltscriptgt       window.onloadfunctionn             document.body.innerHTML  n                window.location.hrefhttpmywebsite.com       ltscriptgt      ltheadgt      ltbodygt      [  token ]      ltbodygt      lthtmlgt codepre  pFirst empties the body then navigates back to wherever we want. javascriptjquery will however, catch the entire content as string, then I simply extract the string between [ and ]. This token is only available for the next request, so every AJAX request will have its unique token. On the 2nd reques the token just used is deleted. p  pAfter I get the token I append it as parameter to whatever link i request, something like thisp  precodeajaxRequestObjet  .ajax     url httplocalhost8084mywebsite.comservlet, lt local tomcat server     method POST,     data typeAJAXamppagesomearticleamptokenfmf5p81m6e56n4va3nkfu2ns8n  codepre  pThis method works fine against someone who inspects the website manually and try to use the links, but what about javaphpIIS servers that do this automaticlyp  pFor this ask for header Something like thisp  precodeboolean isAjax  XMLHttpRequest.equalsrequest.getHeaderXRequestedWith  codepre  pIt will be true only and only if XMLHttpRequest exists....p  pThere is one last thing to keep in mind. Make sure codeAccessControlAllowOrigin header is NOT present in your appcode to make sure that any javascript NOT in your server wont get the server resources. If this header does not exist, chrome will return thisp  precodeXMLHttpRequest cannot load httplocalhost8084mywebsite.comservlet. No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource. Origin httplocalhost is therefore not allowed access. codepre  pJava server was in tomcat and I had another apache for this tests, this is the small html present in apache which gave the error abovep  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquerylatest.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt      ltscriptgt     ajaxRequestObjet  .ajax         url httplocalhost8084mywebsite.comservlet,         method POST,         data typeAJAXamppageToken           ajaxRequestObjet.donefunction msg           alertmsg           ltscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbodygt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 2027 pI have popup being created along the edge of a window and Id like it to expand the popup as the user types into its text field.  This currently works, but the window is expanding to the right.  Instead, Id like the popup to expand to the left and keep the right edge anchored in place.  p  pMy closest example thats kind of working is below.  In it, Im getting the size of the popup with every text input and then moving the popup based on its new size.  I feel like this should work, but its not.    p  pOn the first text input the popup jumps to the left edge of my screen x transformation only.  On the second text input the popup jumps back to its original position.  On a third text input the popup jumps back to the left edge of the screen.  On the fourth input... You get the idea.  Id also like to mention that the overall growth of the window looks like its growing from the center of the popup and not from the right edge.p  pIve noticed that after the button is clicked it remains highlighted until my mouse passes over it.  Could this contributing to the problemp  pAny thoughts or a better way to achieve this effect would be great, thanksp  precodefrom PySide import QtCore, QtGui import maya.OpenMayaUI as mui from

Negative 2027 pI am trying to register two volumetric images from brain PET and CT or even PET and MR. Each of these volumetric images contains different numbers of 2D images slices.  For example, codeCTcode has code150code slices and codePETcode has code100code slices. I was thinking of using an interpolation method to calculate and reduce the number of CT slices to 100. Is this a correct approach Does anyone know of any resources that could be helpful for me like a pseudo code, or steps that I should go through for registering two volumetric images. Thank you p
