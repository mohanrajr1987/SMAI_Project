If this value is code0code i.e., no values in common, just skip this pair of keys.p  pE.g., from the sample above, the output should bep  precode1, [2, 3]  because keys 1 and 2 share the values 3, 10, 11 1, [4, 2]  because keys 1 and 4 share the values 3, 10 skipping 2, [1, 3] is the inverse of 1, [2, 3], so it can be skipped 2, [3, 1]  because keys 2 and 3 share the value 4 ... codepre  pThe pair of keys code1code and code3code and other similar cases is skipped because key code3code is included in the listvalue of key code1code and vice versa.p  pA solution that Ive implemented but I dont like at all, is using the codecartesiancode function to create all the combinations between keys and then a mapping and a filtering to delete unnecessary pairs.p  pIs there a better solution without using codecartesiancodep

Positive 98880 pIm experimenting a problem when trying to write any RDD to HDFS. Ive tried with minimal examples, scala programs and pyspark programs both in local and cluster modes and as standalone applications or shells. p  pMy problem is that when invoking the write command, a task is executed but it just creates an empty folder in the given HDFS path. Im lost at this point because there is no sign of error or warning in the spark logs. p  pIm running a seven node cluster managed by cdh5.4.7, spark 1.3.

Positive 98880 pwe are currently evaluating Spark on our cluster that already supports MRv2 over YARN. p  pWe have noticed a problem with running jobs concurrently, in particular that a running Spark job will not release its resources until the job is finished. Ideally, if two people run any combination of MRv2 and Spark jobs, the resources should be fairly distributed.p  pI have noticed a feature called dynamic resource allocation in Spark 1.2, but this does not seem to be solving the problem, because it releases resources only when Spark is IDLE, not while its BUSY.p  pI havent been able to locate any further information on this matter.

Positive 98880 pI have a lazilyloaded static java class  it exposes a method codegetValueKey keycode.

Like sop  precodeimageOne.YPan  10 imageTwo.YPan  10 imageOne.Invalidate This forces a redraw. imageTwo.Invalidate This forces a redraw. codepre  pAlright so here is the problem I am having. Only one of the images displays is redrawing. If I place a pause in between the two Invalidate calls and make the pause duration at least 110 milliseconds both will redraw, but not simultaneously. So it looks as if the second image is always trying to catch up to the first. Plus, a 110 millisecond pause slows down the motion too much. p  pI have tried placing the updating and invalidating of each image in its own thread but this did not help.p  pAt the beginning of drawing I make the appropriate context is current, and at the end I am calling swapbuffers. I tried adding a glFinish to the end of the draw function, but there was no change. p  pCould it be that its the graphics card that is the problem I am stuck using an integrated gpu that only has openGL 1.4. p  pHopefully, I have provided enough detail that the answer to my problem can be found.  p
Negative 98880 pI have an app that Im writing a little wizard for.  It automated a small part of the app by moving the mouse to appropriate buttons, menus and clicking them so the user can watch.p  pSo far it moves the mouse to a tree item and sends a rightclick.  That pops up a menu via TrackPopupMenu.  Next I move the mouse to the appropriate item on the popup menu.  What I cant figure out is how to select the menu item.p  pIve tried sending leftclicks to the menus owner window, tried sending WMCOMMAND to the menus owner, etc.  Nothing works.p  pI suppose the menu is a window in and of itself, but I dont know how to get the HWND for it from the HMENU that I have.p  pAny thoughts on how to PostMessage a click to the popup menup  pPS Im using a separate thread to drive the mouse and post messages, so no problems with TrackPopupMenu being synchronous.p

Negative 98880 pI have a table that has 5 columns AcctId int, Address1 varchar, Address2 varchar, Person1 varchar, Person2 varchar . Im generating random data to insert into this table via a C console application. Ive tried doing this random data insert via SQLServer and decided it was not a good solution  SQL is not good at random on an eachrow basis. Generating the random data  975k rows of it  takes a minimal amount of time. Its in a List of custom objects. p  pI need to take this random data and update many rows in the database with the new random data. I tried updating the rows one at a time, very slow because of the repeated searching of the List object in code. So I think the best approach is to put all the randomized data into a table in the database, then update all the other tables that use this data. I.e. codeUPDATE t SET t.Address1d.Address1 FROM Table1 t INNER JOIN RandomizedData d ON d.AcctId  t.AcctIDcode. The database is very unnormalized so this Acct data is sprinkled all over the place. Ive got no control of the normalization. p  pSo, having decided to insert all of the randomized data into a single table, I set out to create insert scripts p  precodeUSE TheDatabase Insert tmpRandomizedData  SELECT 1,4392 EIGHTH AVE,,JENNIFER CARTER,BARBARA CARTER  UNION ALL    SELECT 2,2168 MAIN ST,HNGR F,DANIEL HERNANDEZ,SUSAN MARTIN  etc another 98 times...   FYI, this is not real data  codepre  pIm building this INSERT script in batches of 100. Its taking on average 175 ms to run each insert. Does this seem like a long time Its going to take about 35 mins to run the whole insert. p  pThe table doesnt have a primary key or any indexes. I was planning on adding those after all the data is inserted thinking that that would be faster. p  pIs there a better way to do this p

Negative 98880 pI have a question that may have been answered over 9000 times before but I emreallyem dont know how to word it, this is what I am going to try.p  pIve seen in some C books and tutorials that when defining your own class which has a iterable value incrementable semantics, you can overload codeoperatorcode for it all Im going t state here Id guess applies for codeoperatorcode as well. The standard way of doing this seems to bep  precodeclass MyClass      public     MyClassamp operator           incrementsomehow         return this              ....      codepre  pWhere codeincrementsomehowcode well... emsomehow incrementsem the objects value.p  pThen, it is possible to define the postfix version of codeoperatorcode in a manner like thisp  precodeMyClass operator MyClassamp it, int dummy      MyClass copyit     it     return copy      codepre  pIt is all fine and dandy I think I got that idiom right, but the problem is that doing all that for each class that defines codeoperatorcode quickly becomes tiresome and verbose, so I was thinking that I could take some advantage of a trick that I recently learnt when overloading operators. That is, making use of the codeltutilitygtcode header and a facility inside called coderelopscode that I found out about yesterday I just came back to C after emfourem years of being away...p  precodeclass MyClass      public     bool operator const MyClassamp that          return compareforequalitysomehowthat              bool operatorlt const MyClassamp that          return compareforlessalitysomehowthat              ....     using namespace stdrelops  operators gt, gt, lt,  are magically defined      codepre  pI just invented the term lessality for analogy purposes, my head refuses to come up with the correct mathematical term for some reason...p  pI created a simple header codeltstepops.hppgtcode whose content somewhat imitates the codestdrelopscode namespace found in the Utility header. Fro what I can see after a couple of compiles, it just worksTM. Can I  Should I use this trick  What are possible pitfalls I could come up against if I create a class and use a codeusing namespace MyLibraryincrementoperatorscode for example p  pAnd maybe much, MUCH more important strongHave I just reinvented the wheel again, or have I just created a useful small library that could be aggregated to such kinds of projectsstrong Pretty much any experiments that I have tried to do with C to get myself back uptospeed and collaborate stuff seem to already be covered under a codeboostdosomethingcode facility and it makes me kind of sad that I have spent so much time away.p

Negative 98880 pI use authlogic to authenticate users. In my controllers I use currentuser, defined as documented as followsp  precode  def currentusersession     return currentusersession if definedcurrentusersession     currentusersession  UserSession.find   end   def currentuser     return currentuser if definedcurrentuser     currentuser  currentusersession ampamp currentusersession.record   end codepre  pI also use declarativeauthorization to manage the current users permissions. All works fine in the normal runtime scenario, but when I create functional tests that use request statements like  getwith, currentuser in the controller is nil. I looked through the declarativeauthorization test helper code and found that in this scenario, the declarativeauthorization gem actually stores the current user in Authorization.currentuser which in turn comes from Thread.current[currentuser]. So there seems to be quite a mixup of how a current user is handled in different scenarios.p  pMy question what is the appropriate way of finding the currentuser in both the normal runtime and the test scenariop

I have no experience or talent for graphical design, so all my attempts at drawing bitmaps look ridiculousawful, take your pick. I couldnt find a 3rd party control with that functionality and look that fits standard VCL controls. So...p  pIt occurred to me that I could achieve an OK look and consistency with Windows UI by using standard radiobuttons without captions, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Tp0u.png altradiobuttons without captions as a basic rating controlp  pI had a vague and incorrect recollection of a GroupIndex property assigning a different value to each radiobutton would let multiple radiobuttons be checked at the same time. Alas, TRadioButton does not have a GroupIndex property, so thats that.p  ol lipIs it possible to strongcompletely override the natural radiobutton behaviorstrong, so that more than one button can show up as checked at the same time Or,pli lipCan I strongacquire all the bitmaps Windows uses for radiobuttonsstrong I assume theyre bitmaps from the system and draw them directly, including theming support In this case I would still like to retain all the effects of a radiobutton, including the mouse hover glow, etc, so that means getting all the native bitmaps and drawing them as necessary, perhaps on a TPaintBox. pli ol

Negative 98880 pIve currently thought about a webdriven password database with multiple accounts and the loginpasswords stored in a Database engine like MySQL or Oracle. Each password should only be available to some of the usersp  pUser A logs in, creates a new login information and ticks some checkboxes to make this information available to User B and User C. User D and E should not see it.p  pMy first thoughtsp  pThe passwords are stored encrypted in the database.p  pThe main problem here is of course, if you have access to the server you can take a look a the script and detect the decryption algorithm with enables you to decrypt all the stored passwords at once. p  pSo I thought, each user gets a master password to the password tool which is part of the encryptiondecryption algorithm user enters this master password and the logs in with his own credentials. This had the benefit that a third person could not simply take a look at the scripts to see how they are decrypted exactly as he had to know the master password. But of course its still possible for users with very limited access to decrypt all of the passwords as they know the master password.p  pSo basically my question is how is it possible to have a webbased multiple user password database which is not just cracked easily by looking at the plain sources, if someone gets access to the server Is it possible to make the decryption somehow dependent on the user logins which may officially see the passwordp  pThanks for any hints on thisp  pstrongNotice to make things more clearstrong Its intended to be a password database where login credentials for different applications are stored and users can log in and see what credentials they have to use for these applications. Like password manager tools like 1Password and so on. Its just a simple lookup table with usernamepassword, it should not insert or interact with 3rdparty applications.p

But for some reason, when I try it with this exact scenario, the Process object never resolves a main window handle codeProcess.MainWindowHandlecode.   Is there another perhaps even pinvoke method of doing this  Is this a security thing  Im the one staring the process.  The processs main window handle does exist.  I dont see what could be wrong.p  pIf it helps, here is my code. p  precode        applicationProcess  new Process         applicationProcess.StartInfo.FileName  strProcessPath         applicationProcess.StartInfo.Arguments  strProcessArguments         applicationProcess.Start          long nTicks  Environment.TickCount         if applicationProcess.WaitForInputIdle1 minutes  60000                      try                              do                                       Dont let total processing take more than 1 minutes.                     if Environment.TickCount gt nTicks  1 minutes  60000                         throw new ApplicationExceptionMFCApplication.Startup failed The main window handle is zero                      applicationProcess.Refresh                                  while applicationProcess.MainWindowHandle.ToInt32  0                  applicationHandle  new IntPtrapplicationProcess.MainWindowHandle.ToInt32                          catch Exception ex                              Do some stuff...                 throw                               else                       Do exception handling.          codepre  pThe codeApplicationExceptioncode is hit after a minute of trying to get a main window handle other than zero.p

Negative 98880 pIm a .NET web developer for a small organization. We have some skilled developers here, but what we dont have is anyone whos worked for larger, more organized, software shops.  We do all right, but I find myself wanting to structure my code better with little place to turn for advice.p  pIt comes to this. At some point someone in our organization decided we were going to use webservices whenever we had to do any data access at all no matter the case. Thus, our hardware architecture is organized so that is the only way we can access our databases.  This sounds fine in theory, but the problem is most of our apps turn out like thisp  pSpaghetti Mess Of Code In The aspx.cs    Web Service That Does Nothing But Call a Stored Procedurep  pBeyond that theres not much separation.  Whenever I start trying to research better structural practices I wind up reading about things like dependency injections, dirty properties, and class factories, my head starts to swim, and I move on to something else in frustration.p  pHeres a basic example of my wonderings. So lets say I have to make a page to select employees from a list, edit them, and update the database. Is it better to have the web service return an Employee object on a get, and accept an Employee object on an update Or is it better to have the Employee object call the webservice to self populatep  pIn other words Employee emp  svc.GetEmployee42  vs  Employee emp  new Employee42p  pThe second example seems like it would be better organization for updates update the relevant properties and call emp.Update, but the problem is what if I need to get a list of Employees It would be inconsistent to do Employee emp  new Employeeid for a singular employee, but do svc.GetAllEmployees for a list.p  pI feel like Im rambling a bit so Im going to cease trying to explain and hope someone understands my confusion. I appreciate any advice that anyone can offer. Thanksp

Negative 98880 pIve been asked to develop some .NET based websites to site on client web servers.p  pThe solution I develop needs to work on as many .NET platforms as possible. Therefore it really needs to work on 2.0 and will by default work on 3.0, 3.5, 4, etc.p  pThis is to cater for clients who cannot upgrade from .NET 2.0.p  pThe issue is, for speed and flexibility, I want to use the MVC framework which requires 3.5.p  pSo, does anyone know if there are any solutions that allow you to bundle up all the required .NET 3.5 components so that the solution can essentially run stand alone without requiring any installed softwareframework aside 2.0 at the very least.p  pIm pretty sure the answer is no, since .NET ins an integral part of Windows, plus its huge, so bundling it will be a massiveimpossible task  but there might just be a commercial solution out there...p

Recently Im reading a book called HeadFirst JSP amp Servlets and Ive got a question about TCP port concepts.p  pThe book tells me as followsp  pYour internet web HTTP server software runs on port 80. Thats a standard. If youve got a Telnet server, its running on port 23. FTP 21. POP3 mail server 110. SMTP 25. The Time server sits at 37. Think of ports as unique identifiers. A port represents a logical connection to a particular piece of software running on the server hardware.p  pmy questions are 1. Can I have more than one HTTP servers on a Server Hardware 2. is it true that seb servers like Apache or Tomcat can only be HTTP servers if its true, then how many of them can run on a single portp  pThanks a lot I know they are dumb questions but its really important for me to get into J2EE world  p

Negative 98880 pI know that the Map container in STL is internally a RedBlack Tree, which is a selfbalancing tree.p  pIn Map, the lowest element is at the top of the tree.

Negative 98880 pI have a general question that was probably answered somewhere here, but using search was not very productive. So, I will reask and if theres a thread about that, please point me there. Thanks.p  pSo, the general idea is We have two .NETwritten clients that want to talk to each other without routing the whole traffic through the server. Even more, it is not necessary for both clients to be .NET based, but one will be in any case another can be ObjectiveC, C on Unix etc..p  pThe idea isp  ol liThe first client establishes the connection to some server so NAT remembers that the client is on address 10.0.0.11234 and the server is on address 70.0.0.74567. So, when the 70.0.0.7 will send the packet back to NAT, the NAT will know how to masquerade it to client.li liThe second client establishes the connection to the same server so second NAT also remembers that the internal client on address 192.168.0.119234 is connected to server on address 70.0.0.77654 and will also be able to accept packets back for 192.168.0.119234li liNow we need to make the connection from 10.0.0.11234 to 192.168.0.119234.li ol  pBoth c clients can know about endpoints of each other lets say the server keeps the NATted addresses and they are Client1  111.0.0.11111 and the Client2  222.0.0.22222. What is necessary is  for Client1 to be able to send the packets directly to 222.0.0.22222 without calling Socket.Connect fist and for Client2 send packets to 111.0.0.11111 without calling Socket.Connect as well.p  pIs that possible to do with a .NET only without using any special libraries just using standard sockets etc.p

Negative 98880 pI have created a UIView subclass in order to implement a custom drawRect method. By putting some logs in the code I found that drawRect is actually getting called twice as the view first gets set up by its view controller. Why is thisp  pThe other issue is that my UIView subclass has an ivar named needsToDrawTools. My designated initializer for this subclass sets the value of needsToDrawTools to YES. The drawRect method then checks this value. If YES, it draws the tools and then sets the value of needsToDrawTools to NO so that it never redraws the tools.p  pBUT, somehow the value of needsToDrawTools is NO by the time drawRect is called. Nowhere in my code am I setting it to NO, other than from within the ifneedsToDrawTools statement inside drawRect. But since needsToDrawTools is already NO by the time it reaches that if statement, the code inside the statement never even runs. If I remove that IF statement altogether, then it does run of course and I see what I expect in the view. But I dont want to remove the IF statement because that will result in redrawing of things that dont need to be redrawn.p  pHeres my codep  precode idinitWithParentViewControllerNewPhotoEditingViewController vc      self  [super init]     if self          parentVC  vc         needsToDrawTools  YES         NSLogneedsToDrawTools i,needsToDrawTools Console result 1          return self   pragma mark  Drawing   voiddrawRectCGRectrect      NSLogneedsToDrawTools i,needsToDrawTools Console result 0       if needsToDrawTools         NSLogdrawingTools Never shows up in the console         UIBezierPath toolPointDragger  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithOvalInRectCGRectMake75, 100, 30, 30]          [[UIColor blackColor] setStroke]         toolPointDragger.lineWidth  6         [toolPointDragger stroke]          [[UIColor blueColor] setFill]         [toolPointDragger fill]         needsToDrawTools  NO       codepre  pSo again, my two questions arep  ol lipWhy is drawRect being called twice I assume it gets called the first time automatically as part of the view loading process, but I dont know why it then gets called again.pli lipHow does needsToDrawTools end up with a value of NOpli ol

Negative 98880 pBasically put, I have an action that saves a form to a database, then redirects the user to a list.

Negative 98880 pstrongIn brief...strongp  pIm trying to find a way to add some attributes to the properties in the classes created through the ADO.NET entity data model in a way that when I require updating of the database do not always have to add them manually.p  pstrongDetails ....strongp  pI created a class for creating a form that is dynamically filled with controls for editing properts. The input value is the object with public properties to edit. The output is a Control like panel control that contains dinamically created controls for properties editing. This concept can be easily applied on asp.net, Silverlight or classical stand alone applications.p  pCreating controls is based on the type of the property.  For example if the property is some kind of integer data type, then the class creates a TextBox control. if it is Bool then creates a checkbox, if it is a key to referenced table than ComboBox is created or some other kind of external window to make a selection. p  pIn some cases the data type is not sufficent to describe the content of the property and consequently I decided to use Attributes C.p  pMy code is working perfectly but when the time for updating the source database comes when I recreate the .edmx file I loose all my Attributes and METAparameters.p  pI am wondering if somebody has an idea what to do to make this job more automated and simplified for maintenance.p  pMaybe extending the created classes is the solution but it is an additional job to do every time something on the source is changed.p

Negative 98880 pI have looked for similar questions on stackoverflow but I havent found any. I want to export a table in CSV format so that it can be imported into Excel. Each cell contains text and each row has the same number of columns. The format I have tried is the followingp  precoded1d2d3d4 codepre  pwhere d1, d2, d3, d4 are the original strings I want to put in each cell. I have the following problemsp  ol li can be contained in the data. Is this really a problem Maybe not because I have doublequotes around the strings. Maybe I could even use commas and it would not make a difference.li li itself can be contained in the data. Should I escape it in some way My current solution is to remove leading and trailing doublequotes from the original string before putting strongmystrong doublequotes around it. It seems to work, but I think escaping the internal doublequotes would be cleaner. Do you know how to do thisli liThe data can contain newline characters too. I would like Excel to keep the data together in one cell, and to format the text within that cell according to the newlines. At the moment, this is not the case Excel interprets newlines as terminating a record and adds extra lines in the imported table.li ol  pDo you have any idea how to fix the above issues Is there some online documentation regarding these specific problems I been searching since yesterday but did not find anything.p

I dont like this because it means the search will possibly return thousands of records and only then does my code take the 1020 records it needs and discards the rest which is a major waste of resources. Even if each SearchResult item is just a tiny 3KB the amount of memory to execute these searches will grow with time and become a huge memory hog. My shared host is only guaranteeing 1GB of dedicated memory so this is a big concern for my website.p  pSo the question is How do i limit the results of the results in a paged manner using lucene query language alone I looked at the apache lucene project, which lucene.net is ported from, and I dont see any syntax that lets me do what Im looking for. Basically I want the equivalent of what sql server has to limit the rows at the query language level.p  pE.g. this is how we would do paging in sql and it only returns 20 records not every record that matches the where clausep  pSelect  from select RowNumber OVER ORDER BY OrderDate as RoNum, OrderID, OrderDate FROM SalesOrders WHERE OrderCustomerName like Davis O WHERE RowNum BETWEEN 1 and 20p
Negative 98880 pI read lot of about this topic but no solution can be used in my application. Suppose there are few services and lot of activities that need to access db. Of course only one activity is active. But in the worst scenario there is one activity and two services running background accessing db. p  pSo when I close db from activitys onResume  service accessing db would throw exception. And same is when I close db from services onDestroy and there is opened cursor in activity.p  pI hold some kind of DBManager in my application object as singleton. I init DBManager in Application.onCreate.

Negative 98880 pIn the linux kernel, I wrote code that resembles codecopypagerangecode mmmemory.c so copy memory from one process to another with COW optimization. The destination and source addresses can be offset by codePAGESIZEcode and COW still works. I noticed, however, that in a user program when I copy from the same source address to different destination addresses, the TLB does not seem to be properly flushed. At a high level, my user level code does the following I copy exactly one page, 0x1000 bytes on my machine, at a timep  pSRC0x20000000p  ol liWrite to SRC call the associated page codepage1code.li liSyscall to copy SRC into 0x30000000 in destination process. Now, src process address 0x20000000 and destination process address 0x30000000 point to the same page codepage1code.li liWrite something different to SRC this should trigger a page fault to handle the COW. Assume source address now points to codepage2code.li liSyscall to copy SRC into 0x30001000 in destination process.li ol  pAt this point, two separate pages should exist SRC 0x20000000 codepage2code DST 0x30000000 codepage1code DST 0x30001000 codepage2codep  pI find that at step 3, when I write something different into src 0x20000000, no page fault is generated. Upon inspection, the actual page mappings are SRC 0x20000000 codepage1code DST 0x30000000 codepage1code DST 0x30001000 codepage1codep  pIn my code, if I call codeflushtlbpagecode and pass the source address, the user code works as expected with the proper page mappings. So I am convinced I am not maintaining the TLB correctly. In codecopypagerangecode, the kernel calls codemmunotifierinvalidaterangestartendcode before and after it alters page tables. I am doing the exact same thing and have double checked I am indeed passing the correct structmm and addresses to codemmunotifierinvalidaterangestartendcode. Does this function not handle flushing the tlbp  pOk, so literally as I finished typing this, I checked codedupmmapcode and realized that the primary caller of codecopypagerangecode, codedupmmapcode kernelfork.c, calls codeflushtlbmmcode. I am guessing I should call codeflushcacherangecode and codeflushtlbrangecode before and after my kernel code. Is this correct What exactly does codemmunotifierinvalidaterangestartendcode dop

However, I want to be able to provide the user with the option of enabling a form of syntactic sugar, which makes some classes directly accessible under the toplevel namespace. This, however, creates a name clash with one of the gems I am using, which defines a toplevel class. None of the currently proposed solutions work because the gem actually relies on its globallydefined class being there so undefining the class breaks the gem. Of course, the gem has more than one file, and individually requiring its files into a module seems to be a very brittle solution. Currently, the only workaround I have found is thisp  precodebegin    Require the faulty gem.   require rbtagger rescue     If syntactic sugar is enabled...   if NAT.edulcorated      Temporarily remove the sugar for the clashing class.

Negative 98880 pIs there a way to capture the Click event of a Button from the parent Control and prevent it occuring if a variable within the parent Control is truep  pFor examplep  precodeprivate void AssignEventOverrides      foreach Button button in Buttons                Get the event assigned at design time         var someUnknownEventHandler  GetTheClickHandlerSomehowbutton           Unsubscribe the unknown event         button.Click  SomeUnknownEventHandler           Assign the intercepting event         button.Click  buttonClick        private void buttonClickobject sender, EventArgs e      if preventClick               Fire the intercepted event that was previously unsubscribed       codepre  pHopefully theres a nicer way to do this than the above example. Just to note, I dont have any control over the events assigned to the afforementioned buttons. Theyre subscribed elsewhere and I just need to prevent them happening if a variable is true on the consuming parent Control.p  pMy real scenariop  pIm using Windows Mobile 6.5 legacy application rewrite Ive created a panel control that can contain N number of child controls. The panel control allows for iPhone style vertical scrolling. I subscribe to the codeMouseMovecode event of the child codeControlcode and set a variable codeisScrollingcode to codetruecode. In the codeMouseUpcode event I set codeisScrollingcode to codefalsecode. p  pAs codeClickcode occurs before codeMouseUpcode I can check within the codeClickcode event to ensure a scroll hadnt occured when the button was pressed. So basically, if a scroll of my panel occurs, I need to prevent the Click event subscribed at design time from firing.p

Negative 98880 pHave done some research and found some stuff that may be helpful. I would like your opinion about my approaches on this.p  pTHE GOALp  pI will develop an application in PHP Thats the only language I know and unfortunately I dont have time to learn another one right now. I want this application to be able to run offline and locally to any pc. I will use Wamp server and cakePHP framework for this.p  pTHE PROBLEMp  pThis application will be for sale. So I will need some activation method to prevent each app from being used in multiple computers. I dont want something complicated or very very secure. I just need something simple, to prevent nonprogrammers to run this app in any computer. Of course, the more secure, the better p  pPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONS I AM THINKING OFp  pFirst of all, I am thinking to force users to activate their application, by going online during installation. That way they could get a unique KEY from my online database.p  blockquote   pI found phps shellexec command. So I am thinking, during online installation, to get the Host ID Machine ID of that computer, send it to my server and store it to my database next to a unique KEY. Then Machine ID and unique KEY can be stored to a php file. Could I store it somewhere more secure Maybe encrypt itp blockquote  pEvery time the user opens the application, php will read machine ID. If not the same with the one stored in php file, an activation will be required. Maybe could store computers name too or some other idp  pIs that a good approach Would it be possiblep  blockquote   pAnother approach I am thinking of, is to have a guy create a non php installation file. When run, will promp wamp installation and when installation finishes, will transfer all necessary files to wamp root folder automatization for the user. I can only guess though this will work, as my knowledge over other languages is limited...p blockquote  pCould I benefit from this in validation terms Can a non php file interact with my php application and validate it, for only one unique computerp  pAny info will be very appreciated. I have just started building the application and want to know if there is a good way or non to secure it.p  pThanksp

This doesnt seem very efficient, and in fact in this one search it times out.p  pThe SQL query is as follows this is after being generated by my PHP codep  precode    SELECT DISTINCT o.id AS entryid, o.parent AS parentID, name.baseData AS title,business.baseData AS businessdata,     contactfn.baseData AS contactfndata ,contactln.baseData AS contactlndata ,position.baseData AS positiondata,     civic1.baseData AS civic1data ,civic2.baseData AS civic2data ,mailing.baseData AS mailingdata,     community.baseData AS communitydata ,municip.baseData AS municipdata ,county.baseData AS countydata,     province.baseData AS provincedata ,country.baseData AS countrydata ,postal.baseData AS descrdata,     phone.baseData AS phonedata ,tollfree.baseData AS tollfreedata ,fax.baseData AS faxdata,     email.baseData AS emaildata ,web.baseData AS webdata ,empTotal.baseData AS empTotaldata     FROM jossobiproobject AS o     INNER JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS name ON name.sid  o.id     INNER JOIN jossobiprorelations AS r ON o.id  r.id     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS business ON business.sid  o.id AND business.fid  36     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS contactfn ON contactfn.sid  o.id AND contactfn.fid  74     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS contactln ON contactln.sid  o.id AND contactln.fid  75     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS position ON position.sid  o.id AND position.fid  76     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS civic1 ON civic1.sid  o.id AND civic1.fid  77     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS civic2 ON civic2.sid  o.id AND civic2.fid  78     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS mailing ON mailing.sid  o.id AND mailing.fid  79     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS community ON community.sid  o.id AND community.fid  80     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS municip ON municip.sid  o.id AND municip.fid  81     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS county ON county.sid  o.id AND county.fid  82     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS province ON province.sid  o.id AND province.fid  83     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS country ON country.sid  o.id AND country.fid  84     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS postal ON postal.sid  o.id AND postal.fid  85     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS phone ON phone.sid  o.id AND phone.fid  86     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS tollfree ON tollfree.sid  o.id AND tollfree.fid  87     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS fax ON fax.sid  o.id AND fax.fid  88     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS email ON email.sid  o.id AND email.fid  89     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS web ON web.sid  o.id AND web.fid  90     LEFT JOIN jossobiprofielddata AS empTotal ON empTotal.sid  o.id AND empTotal.fid  106     WHERE o.approved  1 AND o.oType  entry AND name.fid  36 AND name.baseData ltgt      AND name.section  54 AND r.pid IN 415,418,425,431,458 AND municip.baseData  Municipality Name     ORDER BY name.baseData ASC codepre  pIt seems to work decently fast as long as the municip.baseData search isnt involved, in which case it flops even at 15 entries in the directory.

Negative 98880 p[EDITED to add It turns out that the answer is very boring and has nothing to do with Win32, dialog boxes, etc. I just had an idiotic bug in my code. Thanks to Hans Passant for spotting it.]p  pThis is kinda long. Executive summary I have a simple Win32 application which creates an icon in the notification area, never shows its main window, and has an about box that can be displayed via a rightclick on the notificationarea icon. For no reason I can fathom, when the about box is shown and then closed, the applications main message loop gets a quit message and it exits. What could I have done wrong to cause thisp  hr  pIm writing a little program that sits in the notification area system tray and does various notrelevanthere bits of processing in the background. Its UI is almost trivial you can rightclick on the notificationarea icon to get a menu, with options Exit and About the former quits, the latter pops up a little aboutthisprogram modal dialog.p  pThe application is written in C and uses Win32 directly no MFC or anything. My apologies for being stuck in the stone age.p  pThe only problem is this emwhen the About dialog is closed, the program exitsem strongWhat could be causing thisstrongp  pIm not sure what further information is most useful in figuring this out. Here are a few observations.p  ul liThe sequence of Windows messages at the end of the applications life, after the dialogs OK button is clicked, is as follows. ul liDialog boxs proc gets WMCTLCOLORBTNli liApplications invisible main window gets WMENABLETRUE.li liDialog box gets WMCTLCOLORBTN, WMIMESETCONTEXT, WMSETFOCUS, WMWINDOWPOSCHANGING, WMWINDOWPOSCHANGED, 3xWMGETICON, WMNCACTIVATE, 2xWMGETICON, WMACTIVATE, WMWINDOWPOSCHANGING.li liApplications window ges WMWINDOWPOSCHANGING, WMNCACTIVATE, messages 0x93, 0x93, 0x91, 0x92, 0x92 what are these, WMACTIVATE.li liDialog box gets WMKILLFOCUS, WMIMESETCONTEXT.li liApplications window gets WMIMESETCONTEXT.li liDialog box gets WMIMENOTIFY so does applications main window.li liApplications window gets WMSETFOCUS.li liDialog box gets message 0x90, WMDESTROY, WMNCDESTROY.li ulli liNo further messages after these to either the dialog windows proc or the main application windows.li liThen GetMessage returns 0 in the main message loop the message is WMQUIT and its all over.li liThe only call to PostQuitMessage in my code is in the main windows WndProc, it occurs when the main window gets WMDESTROY, and it is not in fact called in this scenario.li ul  hr  pPerhaps theres something crazy, or something missing, in my code.

Negative 98880 pI have two types of individuals, say M and F, each described with six variables forming a 6D space S. I would like to identify the regions in S where the densities of M and F differ maximally. I first tried a logistic binomial model linking F M to the six variables but the result of this GLM model is very hard to interpret in part due to the numerous significant interaction terms. Thus I am thinking to an spatial analysis where I would separately estimate the density of M and F individuals everywhere in S, then calculating the difference in densities. Eventually I would manually look for the largest difference in densities, and extract the values at the 6 variables.p  pI found the function sm.density in the package sm that can estimate densities in a 3d space, but I find nothing for a space with n3.

Negative 98880 pIm trying to interface a large Scala  Akka  PlayMini application with an external REST API. The idea is to periodically poll basically every 1 to 10 minutes a root URL and then crawl through sublevel URLs to extract data which is then sent to a message queue.p  pI have come up with two ways to do thisp  h21st wayh2  pCreate a hierarchy of actors to match the resource path structure of the API. In the Google Latitude case, that would mean, e.g.p  ul liActor latitudev1currentLocation polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1currentLocation relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1currentLocationali liActor latitudev1location polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1locationali liActor latitudev1location1 polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location1 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location1ali liActor latitudev1location2 polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location2 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location2ali liActor latitudev1location3 polls a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location3 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location3ali lietc.li ul  pIn this case, each actor is responsible for polling its associated resource periodically, as well as creating  deleting child actors for nextlevel path resources i.e. actor latitudev1location creates actors 1, 2, 3, etc. for all locations it learns about through polling of a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1locationa.p  h22nd wayh2  pCreate a pool of identical polling actors which receive polling requests containing the resource path loadbalanced by a router, poll the URL once, do some processing, and schedule polling requests both for nextlevel resources and for the polled URL. In Google Latitude, that would mean for instancep  p1 router, n poller actors. Initial polling request for a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1locationa leads to several new immediate polling requests for a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location1 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location1a, a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location2 relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location2a, etc. and one delayed polling request for the same resource, i.e. a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1location relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comlatitudev1locationa.p  pI have implemented both solutions and cant immediately observe any relevant difference of performance, at least not for the API and polling frequencies I am interested in. I find the first approach to be somewhat easier to reason about and perhaps easier to use with system.scheduler.schedule... than the second approach where I need to scheduleOnce.... Also, assuming resources are nested through several levels and somewhat shortlived e.g. several resources may be addedremoved between each polling, akkas lifecycle management makes it easy to kill off a whole branch in the 1st case. The second approach should theoretically be faster and the code is somewhat easier to write.p  pMy questions are p  ol liWhat approach seems to be the best in terms of performance, extensibility, code complexity, etc.li liDo you see anything wrong with the design of either approach esp. the 1st oneli liHas anyone tried to implement anything similar How was it doneli ol  pThanksp

Negative 98880 pI have a collsion map, and some places that I want to be light sources. The light source provides light that is actually a shape where I can see the ground. It now looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3eP3x.png altenter image description herep  pSo the light goes through the walls. I want to make it look like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEzxRg.png altenter image description herep  pI marked the collisions with walls with dark yellowp  pSo the light rays stop when meeting the wall. I want to get the shape of the correct light, the best would be bitmap containing itp  pMy first idea was to cast rays from the source and check when they collide with the wall I know how to do this, but then I would need to cast ray each 0.001 deg for example, so its too much time to generate lights. The next thing is that The light shape isnt always circle, sometimes it can be ellipse or halfellipse, even triangle or part of the circle. Generally, I have the bitmap with light that doesnt collide anything, and I want to subtract it a bit to make it look like on the second image.p  pAnd the last thing, Im using allegro 4.2.1, but all previously mentioned bitmaps are 2dimmension arrays with 0s and 1s.p  pThanx for any help, sorry for long question and my bad english.p

Negative 98880 pI am trying to figure out what the best way to structure a clientserver solution. In a nutshell, my solution should have a backend that does logic, and be able to support multiple clients in an intranet. The key here is that there wont be thousands of simultaneous requests...it will likely be capped at a a couple hundred users, so scalability isnt really an issue. picture the service running in an office building, on a local network.

Negative 98880 pMy understanding of OpenID is that it provides a way to have one site contain all your identity amp peripheral info, but to let other OpenIDcompliant and usertrusted sites reuse that info for identifying and authenticating the user. Essentially it minimizes the number of logins credentials usernames amp passwords a user has for the internet.p  pMy understanding of OpenSSO is that it allows you to signin to one site and automatically login to all other sites that the first site trusts. Essentially it minimizes the number of times a user has to log in to these different sites.p  pMy understanding of OAuth is that it allows users to grant 3rd party sites certain access to their information located at one particular site. Essentially, like OpenSSO, it minimizes the number of times a user has to log in to these different sites. The different with OpenSSO is that OpenSSO logs the user into all the participating sites at once with full privileges turned on, whereas OAuth grants finergrained access to these participating sites.p  pSo, first off, if anything I have said is incorrect, please begin by correcting mep  pAssuming I am more or less correct, then I have the following questionsneed clarification on the following itemsp  ul liWhen would I choose OpenSSO over OAuth  just when I want to restrict access that the other participating sites have when a user logs in to one of themli liAre their different security risks for each of these technologies that I will have to consider and integrate into my app  or are they considered emsecure in and of themselvesem basically can I rest assured that if my app uses them that my app is not open to any new attacksli ul  pSince these technologies are so closely related its hard for me to see the whole forest through the trees here  thanks in advancep

Negative 98880 pIm developing a registration website and theres a part where I need to add people. What I do is when they click on a text bellow the name and last name of the person another two fields asking the name and the person once again, so its a copy of the one above appear. This I do it using the codeclonecode method. So lets say the name and last name are inside a div with a class called information. And the codeltpgtcode that adds the extra div when contained has an id called add. Like thisp  precodeltdiv classinformationgt ltlabel fornamegtNameltlabelgt ltinput typetext namename[]gt its an array because theres gonna be probably more than one if they click the add text ltlabel forlastnamegtLast Nameltlabelgt ltinput typetext namelastname[]gt ltdivgt ltp idaddgtAdd another personltpgt codepre  pMy javascript jquery is the followingp  precodeadd.clickfunction     .information.clone.insertAfter.information  codepre  pThe problem with this is that when you click the add text it copies the first div and if you wrote something on it, it copies it too. So how can I solve that. Is there any other way to do it Plus, is there any easy way to make a button to disappear an information div in case the user regrets how many people he wants to add.p  pAny recommendation is well received. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrong Sorry guys. Theres something important that I forgot to say. The information class is only displayed if the user click a checkbox because theres the possibility that they dont wish to add any other person. So, here is the code for the checkboxp  pHTML above the information classp  precodeltinput typecheckbox idcompanion gtCompanion codepre  pJQueryp  precodecompanion.clickfunction       .information.toggle      if companion.ischecked          add.show            else          .companion.hide         .companion.removeAttrchecked       codepre  pI clarify this because I tried the examples that you guys show me but when I click the checkbox the information div does not show up. I should have mention this on my original post. I really sorry.p

Negative 98880 pI have built an app that does some computation and communication with varying internet resources. I branded my application with its tab bar navigation bar for three corporate clients, the only change was the difference in pictures and coloring. So I created three targets and handled target membership appropriately.p  pSo far, so good. But what if I wanted to customize the whole layout of views or even the navigation of the app for a client For example, the next client could ask for a navigation controller based interaction instead of a navigation based on a tab bar. Or to add one more label in one view. Or to use a pie chart instead of a bar graph to visualize a certain set of data.p  pIt leads to very ugly code if you put all different targets in one project with all these ifelse ifelse ifelse if... blocks of code. What if I had 100 clientsp  pNow here is the question In my imagination an ideal concept would be if I could make an Xcode project named emBaseem that does all the domain specific computations, communications and so on of course and has a basic, nonbranded UI. This way the code can be easily maintained for all clients in one central repository. Then, for every client, I create a whole new Xcode project, import or reference the emBaseem project and when I click on Build without any customization, it already builds me the nonbranded, but fully functional app. If a client requests to have a modified layout, I subclass the corresponding view. When hitting the Build button again, it should bring up the emBaseem app but the certain subclassed view replaced the standard layout.p  pCan this idea of a emBaseem app with overriding the visuals be done elegantly in Xcodep

Negative 98880 pIm developing a portal. This portal have contents articles, books... and there are some widgets that take a selection of this contents like featured articles and show them in a determinate order.p  pI think that add a boolean featured and a field order to every content entry of the table of contents its excesive, specially because perhaps exists different types of being featured and, then, different orders.p  pAlso, some widgets works with static data There is one that shows a list of links. Of course, this could be a simple static page but the admin of the web have to be able to edit the links and then, this have to be stored dinamically somewhere.p  pIf the solution is design special tables for this issues I dont know how to plan it, becuase my first approach is create a table widget1items with a pair of fields, the id of the content and the order value. This for every widget, and something similar for the static widgets.p  pThere is a better solution for this problem Thank for your help and attentionp

Negative 98880 pIm having trouble obfuscating a java library with a hrefhttpwww.yworks.comenproductsyguardabout.html relnofollowyGuarda. A part of this library is supposed to be an implementation of a a hrefhttpcode.google.compspiwikiHowToSpi relnofollowService Provider Interfacea SPI and as such needs to be excluded from the obfuscation process. The nonobfuscated version of the application which uses this library works without problems. However after obfuscation process, it doesnt.p  pI suspect this to be due to an improperly set codeltshrinkgtcode element of yGuards ANT task  it probably removes some methods since they are considered as unused. I made sure that the package and the classes are excluded within the renaming phase of obfuscation codeltrenamegtcode so that shouldnt be the cause of the problem.p  pI had hoped that I could avoid shrinkage of the SPI implementation by specifying the only method required to be implemented by the main interface Im implementing as an entry point for the shrink engine, but have failed.

Negative 98880 pMy story is the following. Ive added a button to a tab bar, and I have set the button identifier to Play so that it looks like a play button. I am using the identifier so that I dont have to use my own play.png image.p  pWhen I press the  button, apart from playing a sound, I want the image identifier to change to pause. Im unclear if one can, and if so how to make this change.p  pIve seen some examples of toggling buttons from play to pause etc. but they seem to be using local image files which I want to avoid.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pPaul.p

Negative 98880 pIm experiencing problems with image not being encoded properly in my custom multipartformdata being posted.  After sending out the HTTP POST packet, I noticed the bytes representing the image is completely different. I did this comparison by capturing data packets for a working scenario using the web browser and using my python app. p  pTheres no issues otherwise with how the multipartform body is constructed, its just that the image not being encoded properly for the body. p  pHeres what I did to open the image and prep it to be sent outp  precodeimagedataopenplane.jpg,moderb.read  imagedata is the jpeg in bytes                 fist bytes body.appendstrimagedata    coverting the data to a string such that it can be appended to the body array.   bytes to string body.appendCRLF body.append  boundary   body.appendCRLF body.joinbody   starting the post unicodedata  body.encodeutf8,errorsignore   string encoded multipartheader[contentlength]lenunicodedata req  urllib.request.Requesthttplocalhostapiimageupload, dataunicodedata, headersmultipartheader  Packet sent here and the image section of the unicodedata looks wrong but the other sections look good. codepre  pImage being uploaded a hrefhttptinypic.comview.phppic5aq3w6amps6 relnofollowhttptinypic.comview.phppic5aq3w6amps6ap  pSo what is the correct way to encode this image and append it as part of the body to be sent I dont want to use any apis other than the ones that came with python 3.3. and would like to stay within urllib and urllib2 I tried appending the byte version of the image to the body but apparently string arrays can only contain strings which is why I created a new string with the image in bytes I think this is where it goes down hill.p  pThanks help is much appreciatedp

Negative 98880 pIm using SQLAlchemy to talk to my database. Because not many people will be using my application at least initially, I figure SQLite is the quickesteasiest back end.p  pIve got a codeUsercode, and it has a unique ID thats string based, e.g. codeasdfasdf.comcode, or codeMr. Fnordcode. I dont care what format the id is in  just that its unique. However, I want to this to be a caseinsensitive uniqueness.

Negative 98880 pWhen I load remote content via a block I update the UITableView by calling reloadData. However, I am unable to scroll on this data.

Negative 98880 pSo I have a pretty specific situation where I have users who have X unlimited nodes authored by them... yet they are only allowed to have 6 nodes Published at a time.p  pI googled around for a while and found a hrefhttpwww.badzilla.co.ukDrupal7NodeLimitPublishModule relnofollowhttpwww.badzilla.co.ukDrupal7NodeLimitPublishModulea , which works GREAT, except this limits the TOTAL number of published nodes of a particular content type.p  pI need this exact functionality, except wthe additional limitation on a peruser basis... So that each user can only have 6 total nodes Published at once, rather than the entire Drupal Site only having X total of a particular content type published at once.p  pHopefully that makes sense... regardless, the codemodule from the URL above is exactly working great, just I need to cater it to check on a peruser basis Im not great with module coding or anything, so if someone is able to handhold a little on how to alter the module code on that site, thatd be great TIAp
Negative 98880 pPreface This is a homework assignment, and I am almost done with it  its just this tiny piece that is preventing me from finishing. With this information, please do not write any code for me, but possibly note what I might be doing wrong.p  pOkay, here is the simple idea. Use RSA to encryptdecrypt a file with ECB Mode. This means if there was a block size of 4, and the string was testdata, test would be encrypted with the key, written to file, and then data would be encrypted with the key and written to the file.p  pMy implementation is using 128 as the block size, but Im having a strange error.p  pHere is my code to encrypt a block of 128 and append to a filep  precodeArrayListltbyte[]gt bytes  new ArrayListltbyte[]gt String file  readfileinputfile int index  0 while indexltfile.length      byte[] block  file.substringindex, Math.minindex128,file.length.getBytes     cipher  new BigIntegerblock.modPowpublicexponent, publicmodulus.toByteArray     bytes.addcipher     appendbytesoutputfile, cipher     index128  codepre  pEncryption works perfectly. Heres why I think that encryption is not the issuep  ul liDecrypting the data that is being written to the file worksli liAdding all encrypted data to a list contains the same data as reading the fileli liIf decrypting from the list that I mentioned above, decryption works flawlessly.li ul  pIts the strangest issue, though.p  pThis produces the right outputp  precodeforint i  0 i lt bytes.size i      decrypted  new BigIntegerbytes.geti.modPowd, modulus.toByteArray     System.out.printnew Stringdecrypted  codepre  pBut that is useless, because whats the point of being able to decrypt only after encrypting.p  pThis does not work every time, but it does work occassionalyp  precodeindex  0 file  new Stringreadbytesoutputfile whileindex lt file.length      byte[] block  file.substringindex, Math.minindex128,file.length.getBytes     decrypted  new BigIntegerblock.modPowd, modulus.toByteArray     System.out.printlnnew Stringdecrypted     index 128  codepre  pI am reading the file the same way that it was wrote to in blocks of 128.

Negative 98880 pI am having a problem with codegetAttributecode of session object of JSP in Tomcat environment.p  pWhen Connect button is clicked from an initial jsp page, login.jsp , a connect.jsp page connection page is invoked to get a database connection object and the object is stored as an attribute in a session object. When user clicks Disconnect button from login page, another page, disconnect.jsp disconnect page, is invoked, codegetAttributecode is called to get connection object, and codesetAttributecode is called to set the connection object to null. When checked value of the connection object using codegetAttributecode, its value is null as expected in the disconnect page. This is as expected.p  pAfter disconnecting, when Connect button is clicked on login page to connect to a database once again, the connection page finds that the connection object retrieved using codegetAttributecode to be a nonnull object instead of a null object. This is the problem. Why codegetAttributecode returns a nonnull object even though it was already set to null in the disconnect page  p  pOnce in probably 10 times the code works as expected But most of the time it fails.p  pHere is the actual code for reproducing the problemp  h2login pageh2  precode    When connection page is invoked 2nd time after disconnecting an       existing connection, the connection page returns saying connection       already exists  this is not what I expect.

Negative 98880 pBelow I have a small js based simulator for different command tools. The user enters a command, and if its correct, it displays it at the top. For future uses, I need to make sure it can handle as many commands as needed before completing the simulation. This means inevitably Ill have content overflowing.p  pMy solution now was setting the Y overflow to auto, adding the scrollbar, and a little jquery to keep the client scrolled to the bottom of the output div at all times, because the content is being appended below the previous content each time a user enters the correct command.p  pRight now this works fine, except I would like to remove the scroll bar. Id like the content to behave in the same way overflow auto would and does, except without a visible scrollbar.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compgpr2.png altenter image description herep  pIs there a way I could do this with jquery or javascriptp  pI know I can do some css tricks to put some sort of black over the scrollbar with a zindex, but Id like to avoid that if possible.p

No data needs to return to the phones, so just need a confirmation of arrival.  The data needs to be crunched and sent to a master device, which Im thinking will use a websocket.p  pI have been an ApacheCGI amp PHP guy for years, but I think Node.js is going to be the way to go to collect the data.  Just a simple IO loop that will capture the data and send a simple acknowledgement.  The heavier number crunching and serving I intend to do using C and PHP.  The issue is collecting the data from the node.js server, and processing it on the Apache server.p  pI was thinking Redis, but Im not very familiar with Redis specifically, so I dont know if there is a FIFO implementation, and I dont need the disk writting since the data will be immediately removed.  I am now thinking memcached, but I still dont know of a FIFO implementation that doesnt rely on using timestamps which might be what I ultimately have to use.p  pAny thoughts or suggestionsp

Negative 98880 pIm dealing with a very strange problem. Initially, I thought this was a problem with cleaning up test data... but after completely refactoring my test data cleanup code and still seeing the exact same behavior... Im at a loss.p  pI have 245 unit test methods in various classes. Each class has its own unique test data, and I initialize those objects, and then in each test method that data is usually inserted into the database and then manipulated with the tests. Each test class has a ClassCleanup method that cleans out all of the test data from the database, and that ClassCleanup is also run on TestInitialize, to ensure everything is cleaned up before any other test method is run.p  pWhen I Run All using VS 2012 Test Explorer, 22 tests fail. They all fail with some variation of Primary Key constraint violations. Meaning, when they are initializing data for these tests, the data was not cleaned up from a previous test method in that class. If I rerun all tests, I get the same tests failing every time. This is fairly reproducible. No matter how many times I run all tests. These same 27 tests fail with primary key violations.p  pHowever, the weird thing is that if I rerun ONLY those failed tests, only 9 tests fail. This is ALSO reproducible, meaning, no matter how many times I run only these 27 previously failing tests, 14 will fail, and the rest will pass. This continues as I run only failed tests, until I get to a point where none of the tests fail. It should also be noted that if I run each test class individually, everything passes.p  pI know how this looks. p  pYou obviously are not cleaning up your test data. If that were the case, then I should see the same tests fail on every run, no matter what. Those 27 tests should fail EVERY run, not just when I run everything else.p  pYou must not have unique primary keys between classes and things arent being cleaned up. See above. Even IF I had primary keys repeated in my classes which I dont, because I have personally triplechecked the uniqueness of the primary keys on test data within the various classes, since these tests are not run concurrently on separate threads which has been verified by logging the ThreadId, the cleanup code for any given test would clean out the duplicated data, regardless.p  pYou must not be using connection pooling. No, actually I am. And Ive verified using SQL Profiler that the requests are definitely pooled. Also, because these tests are not running in parallel, there is only ever the one connection thread.p  pYou shouldnt use connection pooling. Well, yes, I should, since the underlying codebase supports various web projects, but for the sake of argument I tried running all the tests with connection pooling disabled using Poolingfalse in the connection string and I get the exact same results. No change in behavior, whatsoever.p  pThere must be something wrong with your local environment. I get the same results running these tests on other colleagues dev boxes which incidentally use SQL 2012, as well. This is not unique to my environment, or even my version of SQL Server.p  pYou should try running mstest from the command line. Already did that. Same results.p  pIf anyone has encountered something like this, please let me know. I know there must be something simple Im missing, as thats usually the case with these kinds of problems, but Ive covered as many bases as I possibly can in trying to sort this out.p

I create one serial dispatch queue that I use for both video and audio writing. When I get a new video frame, I dispatch the job onto that serial queue, and when I get new audio bytes, I dispatch that job to the same serial queue. This way, most of the audio writing code doesnt happen on the audio callback thread which would otherwise slow down the highpriority audio thread.p  pIm able to write a video with audio successfully and it performs fine on dualcore devices. However, on single core devices, I find that theres a noticeable stutter on the devices display roughly every 500700ms. Ive tracked down the culprit to the followingp  precodeif [audioWriterInput isReadyForMoreMediaData]      if [audioWriterInput appendSampleBuffersampleBuffer]             NSLogCouldnt append audio sample buffer d, numAudioCallbacks       codepre  pIf I comment out the codeappendSampleBuffercode for the codeaudioWriterInputcode, then obviously no audio gets written, but theres no stutter in the actual display either. Its weird because all of this is happening strongoffstrong of the main thread. CPUGPU times per frame are on the order of 45 ms, so its not like the CPUGPU are bottlenecked.p  pAnother cluecuriosity when I do write audio buffers, I get a sawtooth like memory graph like the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE9kOE.png altsawtoothp  pIt seems to me that the audioWriterInput is queueing up some buffers and then writingreleasing them.p  pOne last hint is that it seems like the stuttering is less severe when I record as mono instead of stereo. Unfortunately, the sounds that come in are stereo, so when I do that, the sound is wrong. Either way, the stuttering doesnt go away completely so its not really a valid solution, but might hint at the fact that stereo takes up more resources to handle.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on why writing audio with the codeAVAssetInputWritercode causes the entire app to stutter These devices obviously only have one core so all threads will run on that, but it seems strange that the main thread should stutter when CPU load is so low.p
Negative 98880 pIll admit, I havent unit tested much... but Id like to. With that being said, I have a very complex registration process that Id like to optimize for easier unit testing. strongIm looking for a way to structure my classes so that I can test them more easily in the future.strong All of this logic is contained within an MVC framework, so you can assume the controller is the root where everything gets instantiated from.p  pstrongTo simplify, what Im essentially asking is how to setup a system where you can manage any number of third party modules with CRUD updates. These third party modules are all RESTful API driven and response data is stored in local copies. Something like the deletion of a user account would need to trigger the deletion of all associated modules which I refer to as providers. These providers may have a dependency on another provider, so the order of deletionscreations is important. emIm interested in which design patterns I should specifically be using to support my applicationem.strongp  pRegistration spans several classes and stores data in several db tables. Heres the order of the different providers and methods emthey arent statics, just written that way for brevityemp  ol licodeProvidercreateexternalcreateusercode initiates registration at a particular step of a particular provider. The double colon syntax in the first param indicates the class should trigger creation on codeproviderClassproviderMethodcode. I had made a general assumption that codeProvidercode would be an interface with the methods codecreatecode, codeupdatecode, codedeletecode that all other providers would implement it. strongHow this gets instantiated is likely something you need to help me with.strongli licodeuser  ProviderExternalcreateUsercode creates a user on an external API, returns success, and user gets stored in my database.li licodecustomer  ProviderGappsCustomercreateusercode creates a customer on a third party API, returns success, and stores locally.li licodesubscription  ProviderGappsSubscriptioncreatecustomercode creates a subscription associated to the previously created customer on the third party API, returns success, and stores locally.li licodeProviderGappsVerificationgetcustomer, subscriptioncode retrieves a row from an external API. This information gets stored locally. Another call is made which Im skipping to keep things concise.li licodeProviderGappsVerificationverifycustomer, subscriptioncode performs an external API verification process. The result of which gets stored locally.li ol  pThis is a really dumbed down sample as the actual code relies upon at least 6 external API calls and over 10 local database rows created during registration. It doesnt make sense to use dependency injection at the constructor level because I might need to instantiate 6 classes in the controller without knowing if I even need them all. What Im looking to accomplish would be something like codeProvidercreateexternalcode where I simply specify the starting step to kick off registration.p  hr  h2The Crux of the Problemh2  pSo as you can see, this is just one sample of a registration process. Im building a system where I could have several hundred service providers external API modules that I need to sign up for, update, delete, etc. Each of these providers gets related back to a user account.p  pI would like to build this system in a manner where I can specify an order of operations steps when triggering the creation of a new provider. Put another way, allow me to specify which providermethod combination gets triggered next in the chain of events since creation can span so many steps. Currently, I have this chain of events occurring via the subjectobserver pattern. Im looking to potentially move this code to a database table, codeproviderstepscode, where I list each step as well as its following codesuccessstepcode and codefailurestepcode for rollbacks and deletes. The table would look as followsp  precode   the id of the parent provider row   providerid int11 unsigned primary key,    the short, slug name of the step for using in codebase   stepname varchar60,    the name of the method correlating to the step   methodname varchar120,    the steps that get triggered on success of this step    can be comma delimited multiple steps could be triggered in parallel   triggerssuccess varchar255,    the steps that get triggered on failure of this step    can be comma delimited multiple steps could be triggered in parallel   triggersfailure varchar255,   createdat datetime,   updatedat datetime,   index providerid, stepname codepre  pTheres so many decisions to make here...

Negative 98880 pNow that Im almost done with my first app, Im thinking about how I can make some money off of the time investment that Ive put into this project. While itd be nice to have some additional funds to pay off my college tuition, Im not trying make this app paid... So I figure iAds is the best way to go. However, rather than tainting the user experience by integrating ads into the main UI, what I propose to do is to add a Click Ads menu in the Settings portion of my app. This Click Ads view controller will consist of as many codeADBannerViewcode as possibly can fit on the view. This way, if the enduser decides that my app is worth showing support to, he can spend a few seconds of his day showing his support by mindlessly clicking ads for me. Now the big question is, will Apple allow this p  pIve read through as best as I can... the iAd contract and I havent found any part of the document where it explicitly states that I cannot do this. However, there is one section in question herep  blockquote   p3 Developer Responsibilities.    a Valid Impressions. Developer shall not, and shall not allow or encourage third   parties to run robots or   spiders against its Mobile Properties or use any means to   artificially increase the number of impressions or Clickthroughs   available. Disallowed artificial enhancements include, but are not   limited to, a encouraging user Clickthroughs on banners with offers   of cash, prizes or anything else of value in exchange for services   collectively, Inducements, or b application design that   encourages or is reasonably likely to lead to accidental or unintended   Clickthroughs by the user Unintended Clickthroughs. For purposes   of clarification, a Clickthrough is generated when a user clicks on   an Advertisers message or triggers any other followon action.   Developer represents and warrants that there will not be any   fraudulent Clickthroughs, Inducements, or Unintended Clickthroughs on   their Mobile Properties. The Advertisers and Apple shall not be liable   for any advertising fees based on fraudulent Clickthroughs,   Inducements, andor Unintended Clickthroughs. Final judgment on what   constitutes a fraudulent Clickthrough, Inducement andor Unintended   Clickthrough shall be in the sole discretion of Apple. Developer will   hold Apple harmless against any claims of Advertisers based on any   issues with Clickthroughs, Inducements, or Unintended Clickthroughs.p blockquote  pWould my proposed method be considered a Disallowed artifical enhancement Im not really fluent in legalese...p  pI could speculate all day, but I would really appreciate the input from all you iOS developers who have had the experience of using iAds in the realworldp

Negative 98880 pMy understanding is that variables point to values, and while the same variable can be reassigned to multiple values, the values themselves are immutable. While Learning JavaScript the concept of literals seems to come up often, but I havent found a clear explanation that differentiates between emliteralsem and emvaluesem.

It was a desired behaviour and worked for months.p  pNow when execute codemy.csswidth, 1pxcode the codemy.widthcode returns code1code, or if execute codemy.csswidth, 2pxcode the result be code2code. This is not true, because actual width of a codelttdgtcode element is bigger and is equal to codetext123code in codepxcode.p  pDoes anyone know is this a bug or desired behaviour in Chrome I have tried IE 10, FF 24, Safari 5.1.7  the codemy.widthcode function in all these browsers works as expected.p  pThank youp

Negative 98880 pI am writing an agnostic viewer for a collection of systems that Im working with. This viewer will show me the generic structure of my data without needing to know the context of the specific system.p  pIm trying to deserialise a memory stream which contains only a type codeFooltTgtcode where codeFooltTgtcode inherits from codeFoocode. From the agnostic viewers point of view, all the data that I require is in Foo. The codeltTgtcode part is irrelevant.p  pType T is defined in another assemblys. Under normal operation, the system obviously has all appropriate contextual assemblies loaded. The problem is that when running the viewer, none of the contextual assemblies are loaded. when I attempt to deserialise the instance of Foo, I obviously get an exception because the referenced assembly is not loaded. p  pIm trying to detect whether or not I have all required referenced assemblies loaded and thus know whether to try to deserialise the data, or reconstruct the data that I require from other aspects of the class.p  pI know I can do this using a very simple exception try catch block, but, this is not an exception case. I IknowI this is going to happen hundreds, if not thousands of times when I load my data, and this could cause me a nightmare, as I like to have break on exception turned on.

Negative 98880 pIm new to this website, and to the programming world. So, please be patient with me p  pI read about the rule of three, and I understood how the Copy Constructor and the Assignment operator work. So I understood that, the default ones, provided by C, provide a shallowcopy or memberwise of the objects.p  pMy question is ... if the class has a member pointer which points to dynamic allocated memory, the default Assignment Operator, will only copy the address held in the pointer from the original object to the pointer of the object is being assigned to. But wont this create a memory leak For example, the followind codep  precodeclass GCharacter Game Character                      private                 stdstring name                 int capacity   the capacity of our tool array                 int used       the nr of elements that weve actually used in that tool array                 stdstring toolHolder string pointer that will be able to reference our ToolArray              public                 static const int DEFAULTCAPACITY  5             Constructor                  GCharacterstdstring n  John, int cap  DEFAULTCAPACITY                  namen, capacitycap, used0, toolHoldernew string[cap]                                                 int main              GCharacter gc1BoB, 5                GCharacter gc2Terry, 5                gc2  gc1               GCharacter gc3  gc1                return 0      codepre  pSo, in this code, when gc1 is created, gc1.toolHolder holds the address of some dynamic allocated memory of 5 strings. Lets say, address 125. After this, gc2 is created and dynamic allocates memory for 5 strings, and lets say gc2.toolHolder holds the address 135.p  pThe next line of code, calls the default assignment operator, and provides a shallowcopy from every member of gc1 to gc2. This means that now the pointer gc2.toolHolder also holds the address 125, and we no longer can access the memory at address 135. So the default assignment operator, in situations like these, creates memory leaks ... or I understood something wrongp  pAlso, another question, in the case of the default Copy Constructor, because it is called only on objects that dont already exist, it means that gc3.toolHolder wont get the chance to allocate new memory, lets say, at address 145 It will just receive the address stored in gc1.toolHolderp  pTo try to be more specific... what Im asking is if its the same case as above, except we just have both pointers gc3.toolHolder and gc1.toolHolder, reference the same address 125, without gc3.toolHolder dynamic allocating new memory of 5 strings.p  pLong story short, when we instantiate a class that has a pointer member variable which points to dynamic allocated memory, will the default assignment operator cause a memory leak and the default copy constructor share pointers to the same allocated memoryp  pThank you for your timep

It is only supposed to show a message on unlocking.p  pThe problem is though, when Android runs out of memory and kills it, then restarts it, it will show the message again, even if the user hasnt just unlocked their device.

Negative 98880 pI was prefer using static methods in my java code, since I think they are sfunctionalsstateless and has less sideeffect.

He thinks the code should bep  precodepublic class ArrayHelper      public SetltStringgt array2setString[] items  ...      public ListltStringgt array2listString[] items  ...  public class UrlHelper      public String getContentOfUrlString url           visit the url, and return the content of response        public class MyApp      private final ArrayHelper arrayHelper     private final UrlHelper urlHelper     public MyAppArrayHelper arrayHelper, UrlHelper urlHelper          this.arrayHelper  arrayHelper         this.urlHelper  urlHelper          public void doSomething          String[] myarray  new String[] aa,bb         SetltStringgt set  arrayHelper.array2setmyarray         String content  urlHelper.getContentOfUrlhttpgoogle.com       codepre  pIn this way, if we want to write unit tests for codeMyAppcode, we can just mock the codeArrayHelpercode and codeUrlHelpercode and pass them to the constructor of codeMyAppcode.p  pI agree totally about the codeUrlHelpercode part of his opinion, since the origin static code make codeMyAppcode untestable. p  pBut I have a little confused about the codeArrayHelpercode part, since it doesnt depend on any external resources and the logic will be very simple. Shall we avoid using static methods at this case toop  pAnd when to use static methods Or just avoid using it as much as possiblep  hr  pupdatep  pWe are using TDD in our development, so the testability of a class often is the most important concern for us.p  pAnd I just replace the word functional with stateless in the first sentence since the thats real what I meant.p
Negative 98880 pIm working with codeUILocalNotificationcode and I would like to notify one of my controller that the notification has been received even if the app has been terminated.p  pIn my appDelegate I implemented this functionp  precodevoidapplicationUIApplication application didReceiveLocalNotificationUILocalNotification notification      if [application applicationState]  UIApplicationStateInactive          [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNamelocalNotificationReceived objectnotification.userInfo]       codepre  pIn my codeUIViewControllercode I implemented the observer on the codeviewDidLoadcode methodp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectordidlocalNotificationReceived namelocalNotificationReceived objectnil]      codepre  pIt works perfectly when the app run in background. Since the codeviewDidLoadcode method has already been called and the Observer is waiting..p  pThe issue is when I kill the app. Then the observer of my controller is gone and the codedidlocalNotificationReceivedcode method is never called.p  pI think that its because when I receive the codelocalNotificationcode and run the app again. The codedidReceiveLocalNotificationcode method is called before the codeviewDidLoadcode of my codeUIViewControllercode. Then the observer is created after the codePostNotificationNamecode then the observer receives nothing.p  pI would like to know if there is some best practices or pattern to handle this kind of issue.p  pI know that the codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode method is called before codedidlocalNotificationReceivedcode so there is probably something to do there.p  pUPDATE p  pI also discovered that when is app is terminated. Once you tap the notification, It opens the app, call the function codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode but never call codedidReceiveLocalNotificationcode. So I think that Im gonna handle both cases differently.p

Negative 98880 pI am using a database link to call a SQL Server stored procedure from an Oracle database. After the stored procedure completes, the implicit transaction remains open.

SQL Server stored procedures must be written for this mode.p blockquote  pShould I take this to mean that the SQL Server stored procedure should include an unmatched COMMIT statement at some point within the procedure Is this preferable to requiring the caller to finish with an explicit COMMIT statement from the calling side i.e. could the latter approach lead to orphaned distributed transactionsp

Negative 98880 pUsing Python 2.7.1 on Windowsp  pHello, I fear this question has a very simple answer, but I just cant seem to find an appropriate and efficient solution I have limited python experience. I am writing an application that just downloads historic weather data from a third party API wundergorund. The thing is, sometimes theres no value for a given hour eg, we have 20 degrees at 5 AM, no value for 6 AM, and 21 degrees at 7 AM. I need to have exactly one temperature value in any given hour, so I figured I could just fit the data I do have and evaluate the points Im missing using SciPys polyfit. Thats all cool, however, I am having problems handling my program to detect if the list has missing hours, and if so, insert the missing hour and calculate a temperature value. I hope that makes sense..p  pMy attempt at handling the hours and temperatures list is the followingp  precodefrom scipy import polyfit   Evaluate simple cuadratic function def tempcal array,x      return array[0]x2  array[1]x  array[2]    Sample data, note it has missing hours.  My final hrs list should look like range25, with matching temperatures at every   point hrs  [1,2,3,6,9,11,13,14,15,18,19,20] temps  [14.0,14.5,14.5,15.4,17.8,21.3,23.5,24.5,25.5,23.4,21.3,19.8]   Fit coefficients coefs  polyfithrs,temps,2   Cycle control i  0 done  False  while not done       It has missing hour, insert it and calculate a temperature     if hrs[i]  i          hrs.inserti,i         temps.inserti,tempcalcoefs,i       We are done, leave now     if i  24          done  True      i  1 codepre  pI can see why this isnt working, the program will eventually try to access indexes out of range for the hrs list. I am also aware that modifying lists length inside a loop has to be done carefully. Surely enough I am either not being careful enough or just overlooking a simpler solution altogether.p  pIn my googling attempts to help myself I came across pandas the library but I feel like I can solve this problem without it, and I would rather do so.p  pAny input is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.p

Now the first 4 items are sorted.p  pWe choose the 5th element and do a binary search on the first 4 items and put it in the correct position. Now 5 items are sorted.p  p. . .p  pWe choose the nth element and do a binary search on the other n1 elements putting it in the correct position. All the items are sorted.p  pBinary search takes logk for k elements and lets say that the insertion takes constant time.

What if the sorting was done in a sorting array with gaps between the elements This would allow for fast inserting without having to shift many elements. After a number of inserts, we could redistribute the elements. Considering that the array is not sorted we could use a shuffle to ensure this I think that the results could be quite fast.p

Negative 98880 pIve recently programmed a client server program in C where the server was running on an embedded board that had a Linux OS and the client was running on a Linux machine. All I had to do was specify the boards IP address to the client running on the machine to establish a connection.p  pBut now Im doing essentially the same thing but the server is running on an embedded board that has emnoem OS. Im still establishing a tcpip connection between the server and the client, but Im using a standard library called uIP microIP. p  pI was told that the code that would run on the embedded board the server would be very tricky to write since it would have to be platform specific, i.e Id be better off getting a code that was already intented for the platform. My question is though why is it that much harder to program a C file on a board to establish a connection when the board has no OS, when it was relitavely easy to do so on the board with an OS. All I did for the latter was write the code on the Linux machine, then transfer the code on the OS board with codescpcode, compile it, and execute it. Why cant the same be done for the OSless board I know I wouldnt be able to compile on the board, but cant I cross compile the server on a machine, and load it onto the board without having to worry about anything else Why is this circumstance so much more complicated than if I were working with an OS boardp

Negative 98880 pemEDIT My original question refered to PUT requests, I have changed it to PATCH based on the answer provided by thecoshman.emp  pI am developing a RESTful webservice using cornice and I have recently discovered colander. My question is related to PATCH requests. I now know PUT requests should be complete records but not so with PATCH requests. Can I use colander to validate json data attached to a PATCH requestp  pColander is great for validating POST requests as it ensures I have all the right data in my json and also removes any extraneous data. p  pHeres my simple schema.p  precodeclass OrganisationSchemaRecordMappingSchema     orgname  SchemaNodeString     fullname  SchemaNodeString     description  SchemaNodeString, missingdrop  class OrganisationSchemaMappingSchema     organisation  OrganisationSchemaRecord codepre  pThis allows me to keep my view code simple like this.p  precodeviewvalidatorsunique,, rendererjson, schemaOrganisationSchema def collectionpostself     Adds a new organisation     org  DBOrgself.request.validated[organisation]sqlalchemy model     DBSession.addorg     return organisation org codepre  pThe magic being codeschemaOrganisationSchemacode which validates the json body of the request and places is in codeself.request.validated[organisation]code as per the schema.p  pIt also works great with my other validator which ensures the primary key is not already in use.p  precodedef uniquerequest     if organisation in request.validated Implies a validated schema         orgname  request.validated[organisation][orgname]         if DBSession.queryDBOrg.getorgname             request.errors.addurl, orgname, This organisation already exists codepre  pHowever, if I want to process a PATCH request to update the codefullnamecode or codedescriptioncode fields then validation fails unless the request also includes a value for codeorgnamecode which I dont want to change.p  pWhat is the best solution Do I insist on complete and valid records being PATCHed to the server, do I define a different schema or am I missing somethingp

The problem here is when there are more than 12 items the maximum displayed in my screen. In that case if I try to change the colour of the 15th item i.e. I get a NullPointerException.p  pEventually I managed to do it elegantlyp  precodeprivate void updateSlideViewIndicatorint idfrom, int idto      SectionItem si  SectionItem slidePreguntas.getSectionListAdapter.getChild0, idfrom     si.setActualItemfalse     si  SectionItem slidePreguntas.getSectionListAdapter.getChild0, idto     si.setActualItemtrue  codepre  pWith this code, I change a private field in the Item object that help me clear the item from I come, and highlight the item to I am going.p  pMoreover, I look at that field in the getChildView in the SectionListAdapter.javap  precodeOverride public View getChildViewint groupPosition, int childPosition,         boolean isLastChild, View convertView, ViewGroup parent       if convertView  null          convertView  inflater.inflateR.layout.preguntaslidemenusectionitem,                 parent, false           SectionItem oSectionItem  this.sections.getgroupPosition.getSectionItems.getchildPosition      TextView titleView  TextView convertView             .findViewByIdR.id.slidingmenusectionitemlabel     titleView.setTextoSectionItem.getTitle      TextView textView  TextView convertView             .findViewByIdR.id.slidingmenusectionitemtext     textView.setTextoSectionItem.getText      View indicator  View convertView             .findViewByIdR.id.slidingmenusectionitemindicator      if oSectionItem.isActualItem          indicator.setBackgroundColorthis.context.getResources                 .getColorR.color.marca      else          indicator.setBackgroundColorthis.context.getResources                 .getColorR.color.blanco           return convertView  codepre  pThe problem with this solution is that the green indicator is only updated when I scroll the slideMenu beyond the visibility of the item selected and returned it back. As long as I hide the slideMenu and show it again without scrolling, the higlighted item remains wrong. Ive tried also to setVisibilityInvisible and Visible again but it didnt work either. I thought that maybe that way the getChildView function would be called but it wasnt.p  pI would like that the selected item will be highlited as soos as it is selected, and that there wasnt necessary to scroll the list and come back again to see it correctly.p  pI am sure there has to be a solution for this, does somebody have a clue about thisp  pThank you in advance.p

Thus, direct field access from Scala source files including standard Play templates does not invoke lazy loading, often resulting in empty unpopulated entity fields.

If I ensure that A, B use different indices at any time, that is to say, if A is now manipulating codev[i]code, then B is either doing nothing, or manipulating codev[1i]code. I wonder is synchronization needed for this situationp  pI have referred to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions940139issynchronizationneededwhenmanipulatingdifferentarrayobjectarrayindicethis questiona, however I think it is limited in Java. The reason why I ask this question is that I have been struggling with a strange and rare bug in a large project for days, and up to now, the only reason I could come up with to explain the bug is that synchronization is needed for the above manipulation. Since the bug is very rare, it is hard for me to prove whether my conjecture is truep  pEdit both reading and modifying are possible for codevcode.p

I want codesizeSegmentedControlcode to display codecmcode for centimeter in its left segmentIndex and codeincode for inch in its right segmentIndex. When I build the project, I also want codesizeSegmentedControlcode to select the segmentIndex corresponding to the device locale length unit. Therefore, I started with the following codep  precodeimport UIKit  class ViewController UIViewController       IBOutlet weak var sizeSegmentedControl UISegmentedControl      override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad          sizeSegmentedControl.setTitleNSLengthFormatter.unitStringFromValue0, unit .Centimeter, forSegmentAtIndex 0         sizeSegmentedControl.setTitleNSLengthFormatter.unitStringFromValue0, unit .Inch, forSegmentAtIndex 1          sizeSegmentedControl.selectedSegmentIndex  NSLocale.currentLocale.objectForKeyNSLocaleUsesMetricSystem.boolValue  true  0  1                       override func didReceiveMemoryWarning          super.didReceiveMemoryWarning            codepre  pEverything works fine with this code but I know that it is not safe to unwrap an optional without doing it inside an optional binding codeobjectForKeycode returns codeAnyObjectcode.

Negative 98880 pFirst to explain what I am doing here, I want to create a page that list a large number of grouped objects. Selecting an object binds that information to a display on the left. Everything works fine till I change the MainStack Orientation to Horizontal. Once that is changed the page no longer loads. No errors are thrown. When stepping through the process the code behind steps through as it should.  I know its the XAML but am baffled by the cause. It works fine under two circumstances. If I drop the mainstack stack panel and instead make the display group the header of the GridView it works.  If I put the MainStack orientation to Vertical it loads fine.p  pHere is the code that does not loadp  precode    ltStackPanel NameMainStack OrientationHorizontal Grid.Row2 gt         ltStackPanel

The problem I have is that I want an index at the top.  Originally it was just one line anchors to the H3s ID in each table.  That worked fine.  However, now I want to include export links along with the link to the onpage table and to get everything aligned I want to drop it into a table, but Im not sure how to do this.  To have each row in the same table requires having multiple codengrepeatcode iterators on what are essentially dummy elements, but I dont know that I can do that and generate valid markup inside of a codelttablegtcode.p  pIdeally, Id be able to do something like...p  precodelttr ngrepeatdist, style, gender, finishers in genders in styles in race.resultsgt   lttdgtlta hrefdiststylegenderresultsgtdist style genderltagtlttrgt   lttdgtlta href classdownloadgtCSVltagtlttdgt lttrgt codepre  pAngularJS requiring that all of its logic be attached to DOM elements means it requires generating unnecessary markup.  I saw one reference to creating a directive, which looked pretty foreign to me.  Im not opposed to learning the ins and outs of AngularJS, but this strikes me as something that ought to be straightforward.  In a templating system like Twig this would be a snap, but I feel like Im going to have to jump through a lot of hoops to accomplish this with AngularJS.p  pIs there a straightforward way to do this that doesnt involve all of the logic being inside of my controller  If the directive approach is the only option, so be it, but I would consider this a huge mark against AngularJS and my interest in pursuing it.p

Both codecanvascode and codetablecode are children of the same codedivcode.p  pTo switch between 2D and 3D, I change the CSS codedisplaycode property of the canvas or the table to codeblockcode or codenonecode according to the display mode I need to show on screen.

Negative 98880 pIm writing a small debugger. Im trying to find the file and line of code when the program has broken out to the debugger by calling codeSymGetLineFromAddr64code. While the host process is broken out, I call codeGetThreadContextcode to get the registers, codeStackWalk64code to get the current stack, and codeSymGetSymFromAddr64code to get symbols, all of this works fine. Then I call codeSymGetLineFromAddr64code and it fails with an odd series of errors. The relevant portion of the output isp  precodeLoaded DgitdebuggingDebugdebugging.exe at 10000000 with symbols.  Later on, for the first autobreakpoint that gets called when the program first starts running  Breakpoint. Thread context successful. Stack walk successful. SymGetLineFromAddr64PC error 4871e7 SymGetLineFromAddr64Frame error 1267e SymGetLineFromAddr64Stack error 1267e  I type go and the program proceeds to an actual breakpoint, a debugbreak call in the program.

Negative 98880 pI apologize if this seems a little rudimentary however Im at a loss trying to find an example of what Im trying to do.p  pI have my file download servlet already set up and it works on my regular web app, however Im using GWT with that so I know the mobile implementation is going to be different.  When a button is selected, it takes the current record parameters and returns with a download screen with the appropriate PDF file.  p  pIm trying to emulate the same behavior in a mobile version of the same app.  I should be able to hit the same servlet, feeding it the same parameters from my web app and trigger the same download.  I have the required parameters for the servlet on my mobile device already and I already have my web.xml and my fildownload servlet class setup on my server. Both the client and server are ready to talk, I just do not know how to get them both talking.  I have the button created in XML. When OnPress occurs, I want it to send the parameters to the servlet and get the file download back.p  pIm new to Android and still learning. I feel like Im very close. Has anyone done this and if so, could you direct me to an example of it being done or a booksite that goes over this specifically  I really want to learn how to do this.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 98880 pI am dealing with some performance issues whilst working with a very large dataset. The data is a pairwise distance matrix of 60k entries. The resulting vectors have been generated in the following formatp  pcodemola,molb,score, yeara, yearb  1,1,1,year,year  1,2,x,year,year  1,3,y,year,year  ...  1,60000,z,year,year  2,1,x,year,year  2,2,1,year,year  ...codep  pwhere mola and molb are unique molecules INTs and score is their jaccardtanimoto similarity score FLOATREAL and yeara and b are dates INT4 that are associated with mola and b respectively. Since this is a distance matrix the values are reflected across the diagonal iep  pcode0 1 2 3  1 1 x y 2 x 1 z 3 y z 1codep  pThe resulting file has 3.6 billion rows and becomes a 100GB sqlite3 db. It take about 10 hours to make using all the PRAGMA tweaks I have read and doing codeexecutemanycode in 5 million entry batches. I would love to throw away half of it while building the but I cant think of a good way of doing this without ending up building a prohibitively giant list in memory... Its constructed via 2 nested for loopsp  pcodefor i in MolList       for j in MolList          a  calculatescorei,j          writebuffer.appendacodep  pThough the creation is slow it is not the prohibitive part, the actual analysis i want to do with it is.. I will be grouping things by yeara and yearb so I started creating an index on yeara, yearb and score to have a Covering Index but the build is 13 hours in and occasionally using mass amounts of harddrive space on my c drive which is a small SSD vs the raid where the database is. The whole thing is running on 12 core workstation with 16GB of ram, Windows 7 on a 240GB SSD and data storage on a 1TB Raid 1 array built in MoBo controller.p  pI have also been attempting to build a MySql database on a small little ubuntu server that I have intel core duo 2ghz 4GB ram 128GB SSD but the python inserts across the network are taking forever and Im not convinced Ill see any real improvements.p  pSQLite from what Ive read seems like what I really wanted, essentially this would all be handled in Python memory if I had 150GB of RAM at my disposal, but I needed a file based storage solution which seems like exactly what SQLite was designed for. However watching SQLite consume a pittance of memory and CPU while Disk IO bounces around 5MBs chugs away makes me think that disk is just a bottleneck.  p  pWhat are my options for streamlining this process on a single node aka no Hadoop clusters at my disposal Im a DB newb so please keep suggestions within the realm of possibility. Having never worked with datasets in the billions I dont quite know what Im in for but would greatly appreciate helpadvice from this sage community.p

Negative 98880 pI am currently trying to port our existing app to Swift. I used a lot of 3rd party libraries in the old app, but I want to avoid that in the new implementation, because it gave me some heavy compatibility issues with newer iOS versions.p  pSo here is my situation I previously used a MMDrawerController a hrefhttpsgithub.commutualmobileMMDrawerController relnofollowhttpsgithub.commutualmobileMMDrawerControllera to create a main menu, that can be swiped in from the left at any time regardless which ViewController is shown in center as main view. Now I am trying to achieve the same functionality with UISplitViewController in my Swift app.p  pEverything works fine on the iPad.   Landscape MasterViewController main menu is visible all the time. Thats ok because we have enough space  Portrait MasterViewController can be swiped in from the left or can be toggled via displayModeItemp  pBut I am facing issues on iPhone and I am not sure if I could solve them anyhow. Is there a way to show the MasterViewController via UIBarButtonItem from ANY ViewController that is in the detail navigation stack I know its impossible to show it as an overlay like on iPad, but I need a functionality to toggle the current DetailViewController with the MasterViewController and vice versa.p  pAny ideas are appreciated...p  pThanksp

Negative 98880 pI am trying to add thread safety to a lazy init NSPersistantStoreCoordinator. I heard of the synchronized method in objectivec which doesnt exist in Swift.

I tried to put objcsyncexitself after and before the return with no luck. Is there some kind of best practice for this situation My real problem is that in my app, the persistentStoreCoordinator is being accessed by a thread while its being created by another, which makes the app crash.

Negative 98880 pIm new to programming and very new to Swift so am in need of help please. p  pI want to create a view where images will appear and then disappear from the screen at a specific time. The time will be indicated by a label and also a slider. For example, When 5 seconds is indicated on the the label the image will appear, After 10 seconds on the label, the image will disappear.

Negative 98880 pIn a codegrid panelcode which supports adding,editing and deleting rows, I want to define different actions to different rows based on the values in the row. Like,  p  pOn codeaddcode, one new row will be added in the grid. I have a codecolumncode in my grid which has a codecombo editorcode I can select either codeyescode or codenocode. If the value is codenocode, I will disable the next column which is a textfield and also another column which has a button with a hyperlink. And if the value is codeyescode, I want the textfield and the button to be enabled.p  pI tried to get the textfield and the button  by using codeExt.getCmpcode and use codedisablecode, but what happens then is, the codeactioncode will be applied to the column in all the rows of the grid, whereas I want it to be applied to only that particular row where I have selected the  value. p  pTo be more clear, let me explain it with an example..

And the next row, should be independent of the actions applied to the current row...  Looking for some help guidance in this resolving this issue.p  pI am using Ext JS version 3.4p  pThanksp

Part of the issue is that the ID number will appear multiple times since the resource will be checked in and out by multiple people over time, so the search cant stop at the first row in which that matches. It has to look through all rows for both the ID number and the null value, and if it finds the combination anywhere within the worksheet, it should return Yes in the resource list worksheet.p

Negative 98880 pMy app is using  p  ul liASP.NET Http Handler for the backend in order to read the data from MySql database and return them in JSON formatli liReact.js app for the frontend to display the data in the browsers. The app is built by using webpack. li ul  pSeveral pages of the app display Dates and Numbers and I would like to format them according to the browsers preferred language. I found that the cutting edge for this feature is ECMAScript Internationalization API and its polyfill Intl.js  a hrefhttpsgithub.comandyearnshawIntl.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comandyearnshawIntl.jsa. I added it in my apps dependencies and used for formatting, for examplep  precodeuse strict  var React  requirereact  var Intl  requireintl  var formatter  new Intl.DateTimeFormat  module.exports  React.createClass     render  function         ifthis.props.value              var formattedValue  formatter.formatnew Datethis.props.value             return                  ltspangt                     formattedValue                 ltspangt                               else             return false                codepre  pSo far so good, but then I found that the size of the minified bundle.js increases significantly after adding Intl.js in dependencies  300Kb raised to 900kb I understand that it happens because localedata foldera hrefhttpsgithub.comandyearnshawIntl.jstreemasterlocaledata relnofollowhttpsgithub.comandyearnshawIntl.jstreemasterlocaledataa is automatically added at runtime and it is really needed, but I still cant accept that fact that the size of apps script raised 3 times just because it needs to display formatted dates and numbers... So, I am thinking about delegating the formatting to the server side so that it returns Dates and Numbers as formatted strings within the Json response. Thats quite easy to implement and I can see a couple of perks of this approachp  ul liPreserving the small size of appli liPossible performance improvementsli ul  pbut I dont see any obvious shortcomings and thats suspicious. So, my question is  what are the disadvantages of formatting dates and numbers on server side and sending them as formatted strings within the Json response p
Negative 98880 pI wrote a little program to familiarize myself with pointers and relations between them a little more. In order to do this I wrote a small piece of code that just declares and initializes an integer codeacode, then declares a pointer codepcode to the address of codeacode and then goes on deeper to assign a pointer to a pointer codeppcode and so on so far up to codeppppcode.

Negative 98880 pI have an interesting problem. I am migrating data from one DB to another including millions and millions of BLOBs with their metadata amounting to literally TBs of data. Due to numerous reasons, this must be done via DB Link and the view on the other side that contains the BLOBs is not indexed. This is because there is no one unique key and there is complicated logic to  uniquely identify the document only one reason we are migrating to a new system. What Id like to do is the followingp  p1 Split up the rows into separate chunks to transfer so I can access in parallel and also so I do not lose everything if there is a crash 2 Insert into staging tables 3 Once everything is over, I will merge the staging tables into production tables and dump the temporary onesp  pI cannot open a cursor on the view due to the Oracle restriction on LOB references over DB link. I use insert into to get around the Oracle restriction but I really need to slice the rows. I have tried running my script several times but my session would get killed after 2 days and I lose everything.p  pI tried chunking it via rownum to use pagination like chunking but it did not work.

Negative 98880 pI am having a lot of trouble understanding how the codeclassweightcode parameter in scikitlearns Logistic Regression operates.p  pstrongThe Situationstrongp  pI want to use logistic regression to do binary classification on a very unbalanced data set. The classes are labelled 0 negative and 1 positive and the observed data is in a ratio of about 191 with the majority of samples having negative outcome.p  pstrongFirst Attempt Manually Preparing Training Datastrongp  pI split the data I had into disjoint sets for training and testing about 8020. Then I randomly sampled the training data by hand to get training data in different proportions than 191 from 21  161.p  pI then trained logistic regression on these different training data subsets and plotted recall  TPTPFN as a function of the different training proportions. Of course, the recall was computed on the disjoint TEST samples which had the observed proportions of 191. Note, although I trained the different models on different training data, I computed recall for all of them on the same disjoint test data.p  pThe results were as expected the recall was about 60 at 21 training proportions and fell off rather fast by the time it got to 161. There were several proportions 21  61 where the recall was decently above 5.p  pstrongSecond Attempt Grid Searchstrongp  pNext, I wanted to test different regularization parameters and so I used GridSearchCV and made a grid of several values of the codeCcode parameter as well as the codeclassweightcode parameter. To translate my nm proportions of negativepositive training samples into the dictionary language of codeclassweightcode I thought that I just specify several dictionaries as followsp  precode 00.67, 10.33  expected 21  00.75, 10.25  expected 31  00.8, 10.2    expected 41 codepre  pand I also included codeNonecode and codeautocode.p  pThis time the results were totally wacked. All my recalls came out tiny lt 0.05 for every value of codeclassweightcode except codeautocode. So I can only assume that my understanding of how to set the codeclassweightcode dictionary is wrong. Interestingly, the codeclassweightcode value of auto in the grid search was around 59 for all values of codeCcode, and I guessed it balances to 11p  pstrongMy Questionsstrongp  p1 How do you properly use codeclassweightcode to achieve different balances in training data from what you actually give it Specifically, what dictionary do I pass to codeclassweightcode to use nm proportions of negativepositive training samplesp  p2 If you pass various codeclassweightcode dictionaries to GridSearchCV, during crossvalidation will it rebalance the training fold data according to the dictionary but use the true given sample proportions for computing my scoring function on the test fold This is critical since any metric is only useful to me if it comes from data in the observed proportions.p  p3 What does the codeautocode value of codeclassweightcode do as far as proportions I read the documentation and I assume balances the data inversely proportional to their frequency just means it makes it 11. Is this correct If not, can someone clarifyp  pThank you very much, any clarification would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 98880 pI am working on creating a search mechanism where the user can specify which fields to search on, the operators to use and the values to search for. More like an advanced search. However, I also need to search for dates and date ranges but the problem is that dates are declared as NSStrings and not NSDates. So basically they are strings that represent dates and not literally dates as I am referring to them as. An example of a string that represents a date in the database is 20141125T0000001000.p  pSo, without changing the values and their respective fields to NSDates in a migration, is there a way to keep what we already have but instead specify a sort of conversion criteria for my predicate query so that Core Data can convert the NSString field values to NSDates and then do the comparison to determine weather a record fits into the specified criteria or notp

Negative 98880 pI have implemented quick sort as below. In the strongpartitionstrong logic I have seen everywhere two pointers by pointers I do not wish to refer to CC pointers, but simple variables to traverse are being used, one starts to traverse the array from start looking for an element greater than pivot and other from end looking for an element smaller than pivot. p  pThe sum of elements traversed by both pointers is N, size of part of array passed to the partition logic.p  pTo make it easy I have just used single pointer and start traversing the elements from start till one step less than end where my pivot element lies. I assume my pivot position is in the start so I keep another variable to store my pivotindex. In case I find any element smaller than my pivot element then I do  a swap between my assumed pivotindex and my current traversed index and increment my pivot index by 1. At the end of the loop I have position for my pivot ready, which I return. p  pstrongI just wish to know If my approach has shortcomings over the approach where array passed to Partition logic is traversed from both ends [ find greater element in the left traversal and smaller in the right and then swap both , continue this until left and right traversal pointers cross each other ].strongp  pKindly help.

Negative 98880 pIm experiencing some trouble with my Android application.

Therefore I designed a Service, that binds with an activity when launched, to inform the user how much longer the task will take.p  pThe data the app has to copy from online database to local SQLlite is quite large, this causes the memory to spike very high, because the AzureService amp SqlService must request pretty big lists of data. It goes from  30mb to 60mb ram. Once all this is done, the activity in charge for the syncing stops the service and a strongSecondActivitystrong is launched.p  pMy problem is that even after the strongFirstActivitystrong  handles the sycing  has killed everything  the connection, the service, the activity itself  the memory doesnt drop in the strongSecondActivitystrong. Ive tried different tricks to get it to drop  punch the cause gc in the monitor, open other apps that require memory  but it doesnt seem to work.

Negative 98880 pI am trying to learn pthreads and I have been experimenting with a program that tries to detect the changes on an array. Function codearraymodifiercode picks a random element and toggles its value 1 to 0 and vice versa and then sleeps for some time big enough so race conditions do not appear, I know this is bad practice. codechangedetectorcode scans the array and when an element doesnt match its prior value and it is equal to 1, the change is detected and codediffcode array is updated with the detection delay.p  pWhen there is one codechangedetectorcode thread codeNTHREADS1code it has to scan the whole array. When there are more threads each is assigned a portion of the array. Each detector thread will only catch the modifications in its part of the array, so you need to sum the catch times of all 4 threads to get the total time to catch all changes.p  pHere is the codep  precodeinclude ltpthread.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltsystime.hgt include lttime.hgt  define TIMEINTERVAL 100 define CHANGES 5000  define UNUSEDx void x  typedef struct      unsigned int tid  parm  static volatile unsigned int myarray static unsigned int oldvalue static struct timeval timearray static unsigned int N  static unsigned long int diff[NTHREADS]  0  void arraymodifiervoid args void changedetectorvoid arg  int mainint argc, char argv      if argc lt 2          exit1           N  unsigned intstrtoulargv[1], NULL, 0      myarray  callocN, sizeofint     timearray  mallocN  sizeofstruct timeval     oldvalue  callocN, sizeofint      parm p  mallocNTHREADS  sizeofparm     pthreadt generatorthread     pthreadt detectorthread  mallocNTHREADS  sizeofpthreadt      for unsigned int i  0 i lt NTHREADS i          p[i].tid  i         pthreadcreateampdetectorthread[i], NULL, changedetector, void ampp[i]           pthreadcreateampgeneratorthread, NULL, arraymodifier, NULL      pthreadjoingeneratorthread, NULL      usleep500      for unsigned int i  0 i lt NTHREADS i          pthreadcanceldetectorthread[i]           for unsigned int i  0 i lt NTHREADS i fprintfstderr, lu , diff[i]     fprintfstderr, n     exit0    void arraymodifiervoid arg      UNUSEDarg     srandtimeNULL      unsigned int changingsignals  CHANGES      while changingsignals          usleepTIMEINTERVAL         const unsigned int r  rand  N          gettimeofdayamptimearray[r], NULL         myarray[r]  1           pthreadexitNULL   void changedetectorvoid arg      const parm p  parm arg     const unsigned int tid  pgttid     const unsigned int start  tid  N  NTHREADS                                 tid lt N  NTHREADS  tid  N  NTHREADS     const unsigned int end  start  N  NTHREADS                               tid lt N  NTHREADS     unsigned int r  start      while 1          unsigned int tmp         while tmp  myarray[r]  oldvalue[r]              r  r lt end  1  r  1  start                   oldvalue[r]  tmp         if tmp              struct timeval tv             gettimeofdayamptv, NULL              detection time in usec             diff[tid]  tv.tvsec  timearray[r].tvsec  1000000  tv.tvusec  timearray[r].tvusec                codepre  pwhen I compile amp run like thisp  precodegcc Wall Wextra O3 DNTHREADS1 file.c pthread ampamp .a.out 100 codepre  pI getp  precode665 codepre  pbut when I compile amp run like thisp  precodegcc Wall Wextra O3 DNTHREADS4 file.c pthread ampamp .a.out 100 codepre  pI get p  precode152 190 164 242 codepre  pthis sums up to 748.p  pSo, the delay for the multithreaded program is larger.p  pMy cpu has 6 cores.p

Negative 98880 pI have to 2 separate codes that I need to combine using Visual Studios 2013 on Windows 7. The first one is a console application using OpenCV, Qt, and Intraface.  The second is a Windows application that came from Microsofts Magnification API.  They both work separately on their own, however Im having trouble putting them together.  I want to use Microsofts code to magnify sections of the screen, but instead of getting an input from the location of the mouse cursor on the screen, I want to receive the input from the 1st code. p  pI was wondering how I can go about calling the first code in order to retrieve this position. Would I just have to add all the header and source files from the first code into the Magnification project And then call the necessary function in the Magnification projects main loop, so that it can update the position accordingly     p  pIm new to C, but I would really like to accomplish this.  Any guidance at how I should approach this would be very much appreciated.  Thank Youp
Negative 98880 pI have an issue with image loading in IE 11. I am displaying coupons in RABAT theme in a page. But some of the thumbnails are not uploading. If I just refresh page all thumbnail images displayed without any issue. My IE version is 11.0.9600.17959 . The main issue is that some of images are not loading first time a red cross image appears instead and on refresh image just appears. If I long click on an image and click show Pictures, it shows image. Can anyone please help me with this issuep  pThanks Abhishekp

Negative 98880 pConsider the following scenario p  pI want to design a discount calculator which gets me the discount that can be applied to an order. There are two types of order Online and InStore. Based on type of the order and total amount of the order, a discount calculator calculates the discount.p  pI programmed to demonstrate the scenario in C but the problem is language independent. In the below code, codeDiscountCalculatorcode class calculates the discount by examining the actual type of input parameter.p  pI feel checking the actual type of codeIOrdercode argument in codeGetDiscountcode method is code smell because I hid the implementation details behind the interface codeIOrdercode, then I somehow bring out of the box what was meant to be hidden.p  precode    interface IOrder              int GetTotalPrice           class InStoreOrder  IOrder              public int GetTotalPrice   returns the price of order            class OnlineOrder  IOrder              public int GetTotalPrice   returns the price of order            class DiscountCalculator              public int GetDiscountIOrder order                      Type orderType  order.GetType             if orderType  typeofOnlineOrder                              if order.GetTotalPrice lt 100                     return 2                 else                     return 5                          if orderType  typeofInStoreOrder                              if order.GetTotalPrice lt 100                     return 3                 else                     return 6                          else                 throw new ExceptionUnknown order type  orderType.Name               codepre  pstrongAny ideastrongp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI really appreciate people collaborating on this. All of the solutions were not only enlightening but also brought an elegant way on the table. p  pBTW, since the time all of the answers assured me that the solution is not good, I was thinking to myself that codeAbstract Factorycode may be a good alternative. Why Because we are dealing with a family of related objects codeOrdercode and codeDiscountCalculatorcode.p  pSomething like thisp  precodeFactory f  new FactoryRepo Online IOrder order  f.CreateItem IDiscountCalculator discounter  f.CreateDiscountCalculator .... codepre  pThis way, I think for future changes, as Dhruv Rai Puri pointed out, Decorator pattern may be easily applied.p  pstrongAny Ideastrongp
