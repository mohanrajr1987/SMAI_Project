Positive 640 pI am new to leafletjs. I am working on a map that renders just the united states map with few layers options such as roads and major roads ecc.. I have a base layer that uses a hrefhttpleafletjs.comreference.htmltilelayerwms relnofollowWMSa protocol to get the first layers tiles with the following codep  precodeL.tileLayer.wms...... codepre  pThen I have another layer that comes from a different server which does not use WMS protocol. This server accepts parameters like bbox, height, width, lat, lng and few others. I can query this server for one tile at a time, so i need to provide multiple ajax calls to get multiple tiles to cover my current view and also update all layers when the map is moved.p  pstrongThe problem I have is how to make both layers work together and how to get the Bounding Box of each tile the leafletJS way and how to continue to update all tiles on moveend event as the user moves the mapstrongp  pUsing version 0.7.3 of leafletJSp  pThanks for your helpp

Positive 640 pIm trying to create a web app that needs to use an interactive map as part of the program. Is there an easy way to make a US map that I would be able to pin under individual states and such the Google map API seems to include everything and dont really know if i would be able to use something like that for a personal web app. Something to the extent of the image link, its from a mobile app but the way it is set up and presented is something I am looking for. a hrefhttpwww.gamezebo.comwpcontentuploads201408maddenmobileevents.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.gamezebo.comwpcontentuploads201408maddenmobileevents.jpga p

Positive 640 pIm developing an application using Gmap in c great API, btw, not to confuse with googlemap API, and I did some really cool and useful stuff ever since.p  pMy problem is that some of my clients wont have an internet connection, and that is why I need to be able to display the background the map offline. I used to use the property codeGMap.NET.AccessMode.ServerAndCachecode to get my data from the server, and now I would like to be able to use codeGMap.NET.AccessMode.CacheOnlycode with a full cache.p  pLetting them load the cache with a connection to prepare for an offline use is not an option, the PCs will never be connected to the internet. After some research, I learned OpenStreetMap is the only open source map that would allow me to use their map for free and that is good because they have very good maps. I downloaded a 20GB map of Europe, but I have no idea how to specify it as the cache I know how to locate the cache folder.p  pMost of the time, my Google searches showed me people trying to create a virtual sqlite server with all the maps tiles in a DB accessed via localhost, but honestly I think this is very complex and I would like to know if anybody has an idea to allow me to use those maps offline or a link for the doc of this api, impossible to find on the net I found the sources, but almost no comment and no explanation.p  pThanks in advance, and sorry for my bad English.p  prponses en franais bienvenues.p
Positive 640 pI just started using Java, seems pretty straight forward. When I make a gps app with google maps on an android device theres no issue.

Positive 640 pHello im new here so i hope i am posting in the right place sorry if not, Here is my script, when i run the script on IE it somewhat works. The only problem is that the marker icons themselves are not showing on the map. If i hover the courser over the map where I know a train is and click it all of the information shows up in the info box which is great but i want to be able to see the marker icon on the map so as i know where on the map to click. Also i have tried it on other browsers with nothing happening at all only map shows but if i could get the icon problem fix it would be great. Please could anyone show me where im going wrong as this is doing my head in for the past week or so.

Negative 640 pHow can I compile java code from an arbitrary string in memory in Java 5 and Java 6, load it and run a specific method on it predefinedp  pBefore you flame this, I looked over existing implementationsp  ul liMost rely on Java 6 Compiler API.li liThose that dont, rely on tricks.li liYes, I checked out commonsjci. Either Im too dense to understand how it works, or it just doesnt.li liI could not find how to feed the compiler my current class path which is quite huge.li liOn the implementation that worked in Java 6, I could not find how to correctly load inner classes or inner anonymous classes.li liId quite like it if the entire thing was inmemory, as the thing runs on multiple environments.li ul  pIm sure this has been solved before, but I cant find anything that looks even halfproduction quality on google except jci, which, as Ive said before, I havent managed to use.p  pEdit p  ul liI looked over JavaAssist  I need inner classes, Java 5.0 language level support and compiling with the entire classpath. Also, Id like to create new classes on the fly. I  might be mistaken, but I couldnt find how to do this with JavaAssit.li liIm willing to use a filesystem based solution calling javac but I dont know how to divine the classpath, nor how to later load the files which are not in my classpath with a special classloader that can be recycled for multiple invocations. While I do know how to research it, Id prefer a ready solution.li ul  pEdit2 For now, Im content with BeanShell evaluate. Apparently it does everything I need it to get a string, evaluate it in the context of the current classpath. It does miss some of Java 5 features, but it can use enums not define and compiled generic erased classes, so it should be enough for what I want.p  pdelI dont want to mark the answer as accepted yet since I do hope for a better solution to come up.delp  pEdit3 Accepted the beanshell suggestion  it really works wonderfully.p

Negative 640 pi have an application that records a datetime when the space bar is pressed unfortunately, the window doesnt always have focus, for various reasons. eg virus checker popup, itunes update, windows update, etcp  pso what i though would be a cool idea is to use a joystick button, then regardless of which window has focus, i can always detect the button press event and record the datetime it was pressed.p  pnow i had a look at a few game tutorials, but they seem to have the joystick polling tied into the screen refresh event, because in a game i guess if the computer is slow and the screen doesnt refresh often, having the joystick button pressed is going to make no difference anyway.p  pThat doesnt really suit my need, so i am looking at running a thread that will poll the joystick every so oftenp  pMy questions arep  ol liis a background thread the best solutionli lihow often should i poll the joystickli liwhat kind of timer should i use to determine the polling frequency. li ol  pI would like the responses to be at least equivalent to a keyboard. also need to make sure it doesnt autorepeat if trigger is held down.p  pany sample code C appreciatedp  pthanksp  palexp

Is there a way to reset the region and if so, what value do i reset it to. I tried nil, zero and some calculated value but core animation says they are all invalid. how do i get that to zoom out and back in on my new annotationsp  phere is some codep  precodevoidrecenterMap   NSArray coordinates  [mapView valueForKeyPathannotations.coordinate] CLLocationCoordinate2D maxCoord  90.0f, 180.0f CLLocationCoordinate2D minCoord  90.0f, 180.0f  NSLog, [coordinates description]  for NSValue value in coordinates      CLLocationCoordinate2D coord  0.0f, 0.0f     [value getValue ampcoord]      ifcoord.longitude gt maxCoord.longitude          maxCoord.longitude  coord.longitude           ifcoord.latitude gt maxCoord.latitude          maxCoord.latitude  coord.latitude           ifcoord.longitude lt minCoord.longitude         minCoord.longitude  coord.longitude           ifcoord.latitude lt minCoord.latitude         minCoord.latitude  coord.latitude         MKCoordinateRegion region  0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f region.center.longitude  minCoord.longitude  maxCoord.longitude  2.0 region.center.latitude  minCoord.latitude  maxCoord.latitude  2.0 region.span.longitudeDelta  maxCoord.longitude  minCoord.longitude region.span.latitudeDelta  maxCoord.latitude  minCoord.latitude   [mapView setRegion region animated YES]  codepre  pThats the recenter methos im usingp  precode MKAnnotationView mapView MKMapView mapView viewForAnnotation id ltMKAnnotationgtannotation  MKAnnotationView view  nil ifannotation  mapView.userLocation      Annotation schoolAnn  Annotationannotation     view  [self.mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifierschoolLoc]     ifnil  view         view  [[[MKPinAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotationschoolAnn     reuseIdentifierschoolLoc]autorelease]           [MKPinAnnotationView view setAnimatesDropYES]     [view setCanShowCalloutYES]   else       [self recenterMap]   return view  codepre  pThis else piece waits until the blue marble drops in then recenters the map.

Negative 640 pIve got a bit of an odd problem. I have a project in C thats basically a wrapper for a third party DLL like thisp  pMyLibrarybr loads DLLAbr loads DLLBp  pI load DLLA with LoadLibrary, wrap several of its functions and generate my own DLL. Ive tested this in a C project and a C project. Both do everything theyre supposed to do load DLLA, make a couple of function calls, and indirectly load DLLB. The problem is when I build a DLL for java and make the calls through JNI. Everything runs like it should no java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError, but when it comes time for DLLA to load DLLB it doesnt work. From debugging, the loading of DLLB happens on a function call in DLLA that takes a callback. When called from Java, this function call seems to fail the function pointer is fine and the actual call goes off without a hitch, and I get an odd popup window saying DLLB failed to load, and my program is left waiting for a callback that never happens. I can explicitly load DLLB just fine both from Java and from C and Ive checked every possible path, path variable, and tried placing the dlls everywhere to see if it could be looking somewhere funny. Im pretty sure its not a path problem.p  pUltimately I dont know how DLLA is loading DLLB and I cant figure out why everything works fine in C and C, but not in Java. Im absolutely flummoxed. It could still be something specific to my setup although Ive looked as hard as I can look, but Im throwing this scenario out there to see if anyone has run into a similar problem.p  pDavep

Negative 640 pIm working on a simple MySQL fulltext search feature on a CakePHP site, and noticed that MySQL strips short words 3 chars or less out of the query. Some of the items in the site have 3 character titles, however, and Id like to include them in the results. Ive ruled out using more robust search appliances like Solr due to budget constraintsp  pSo I want to find any 3 character words in the query string, and do a quick lookup just on the title field. The easiest way I can think to do this is to codeexplodecode the string and iterate over the resulting array with codestrlencode to find words of 3 characters. Then Ill take those words and do a codeLIKEcode search on the title field, just to make sure nothing that should obviously be in the results was missed.p  pIs there a better  easier way to approach thisp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Yes, I know about the codeftminwordlencode setting in MySQL.

Negative 640 pI am using codeCore Datacode to manage objects and using a codeNSTableViewcode to display those objects.

Then only remained objects are left in the codeNSTableViewcode.p  pThis works smoothly. But after deleting selected rows, codeNSTableViewcode does not select a row automatically.

Negative 640 pIm in the process of documenting a Ruby project with rdoc, and I discovered the darkfish rdoc formatter.  I really like it, but the codecallseqcode tag no longer works.  Instead, it puts the literal string codecallseqcode in the documentation and then formats the call sequence itself as a code block.  I dont want to just take all of the callseq blocks out of my code, since much of my documentation needs to refer to instance names and parameter names given in the codecallseqcode block.  Has anyone else had this problem  What should I do, and is there a workaround  Im pretty sure the codecallseqcode tag was working before when I was using the default formatter, but I cant be sure because I cant figure out how to go back to generating the original format calling rdoc with no arguments except files generates darkfish output now, even if I delete the doc folder  Does anyone know how to fix thisp

Negative 640 pIn Window Forms, Ive put a pictureBox as a background image. Then, Ive made it so that if I resize the window, the image stretches and gets bigger as I resize it, and that the entire picture is always filling the entire form. For this, Ive used the following codep  pre     image.Dock  DockStyle.Fill      image.Anchor  AnchorStyles.Top  AnchorStyles.Left      image.SizeMode  PictureBoxSizeMode.StretchImagepre  pI had no problems with that whatsoever simply because the image is filling in the entire window. p  pWhat I want to do now, however, is to put on another smaller pictureBox, thats going to be exactly 20 px above the center of the Form, and will also stretch appropriately as I resize the window, and will always stay slightly above the center of the Form, no matter how much I resize it.p  pThe thing is that I cannot set the Location property of the pictureBox, because then the position is absolute and the image will not stretch and stay in the center as I resize the window, but will remain where it is, according to the x and y coordinates of the window. What I want is for the picture to stretch and move according to how I stretch and move the window, just like Ive managed to do with the image I have in background.p

Negative 640 pWe are developing an application using Adobe Air from the client gui with a mix of WCF and REST on the backend. One of the requirements of this application is that it must work offline.

Then if the call succeeds it updates the local database so it wont try to send that case out again.p  pFor this particular operation  OpenMedicalCase, the app sends out the request and cant decode the response.

Negative 640 pIn trying to learn the art of data storage I have been trying to take in as much solid information as possible.  PerformanceDBA posted some really helpful tutorialsexamples in the following posts among others a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4061826ismydatanormalizedis my data normalizeda and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4702728relationaltablenamingconventionRelational table naming conventiona.  I already asked a subset question of this model a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4763141datamodelingsupertypesubtypeherea.p  pSo to make sure I understood the concepts he presented and I have seen elsewhere I wanted to take things a step or two further and see if I am grasping the concepts.  Hence the purpose of this post, which hopefully others can also learn from.  Everything I present is conceptual to me and for learning rather than applying it in some production system.  It would be cool to get some input from PerformanceDBA also since I used his models to get started, but I appreciate all input given from anyone.p  pAs I am new to databases and especially modeling I will be the first to admit that I may not always ask the right questions, explain my thoughts clearly, or use the right verbage due to lack of expertise on the subject.  So please keep that in mind and feel free to steer me in the right direction if I head off track.  p  pIf there is enough interest in this I would like to take this from the logical to physical phases to show the evolution of the process and share it here on Stack.  I will keep this thread for the Logical Diagram though and start new one for the additional steps.  For my understanding I will be building a MySQL DB in the end to run some tests and see if what I came up with actually works.p  pHere is the list of things that I want to capture in this conceptual model. strongEdit for V1.2strongp  ol liThe purpose of this is to list Bands, their members, and the Events that they will be appearing at, as well as offer music and other merchandise for saleli liMembers will be able to match up with friendsli liMembers can write reviews on the Bands, their music, and their events. ul liThere can only be one review per member on a given item, although they can edit their reviews and history will be maintained.li liBandMembers will have the chance to write a single Comment on Reviews about the Band they are associated with. Collectively as a Band only one Comment is allowed per Review.li liMembers can then rate all Reviews and Comments but only once per given instanceli ulli liMembers can select their favorite Bands, music, Merchandise, and Eventsli liBands, Songs, and Events will be categorized into the type of Genre that they are and then further subcategorized into a SubGenre if necessary. It is ok for a Band or Event to fall into more then one GenreSubGenre combination.li liEvent date, time, and location will be posted for a given band and members can show that they will be attending the Event. An Event can be comprised of more than one Band, and multiple Events can take place at a single location on the same dayli liEvery party will be tied to at least one address and address history shall be maintained. Each party could also be tied to more then one address at a time i.e. billing, shipping, physicalli liThere will be stored profiles for Bands, BandMembers, and general members.li ol  pSo there it is, maybe a bit involved but could be a great learning tool for many hopefully as the process evolves and input is given by the community. Any inputp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combZaDB.png altalt textp  pstrongEDIT v1.1strong In response to PerformanceDBAp  pstrongU.3 That means no merchandise other than Band merchandise in the database. Correct strong  That was my original thought but you got me thinking.  Maybe the site would want to sell its own merchandise or even other merchandise from the bands.  Not sure a mod to make for that. Would it require an entire rework of the Catalog section or just the identifying relationship that exists with the Band Attempted a mod to sell both complete albums or song.  Either way they would both be in electronic format only available for download.  That is why I listed an Album as being comprised of Songs rather then 2 separate entities.p  pstrongU.5strong I understand what you bring up about the circular relation with Favorite.  I would like to get to this It is either one Entity with some form of differentiation FavoriteType which identifies its treatment but how to is not clear to me.  What am I missing herep  pstrongu.6strong Business Rules This is probably the only area you are weak in.br Thanks for the honest response.  I will readdress these but I hope to clear up some confusion in my head first with the responses I have posted back to you.p  pstrongQ.1strong Yes I would like to have Accepted, Rejected, and Blocked.

Can you expand as to what you mean herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comklPW3.png altalt textp  pstrongEDIT V1.2strong In response to PerformanceDBA input...p  pstrongLessons learned.strong p  ol liI was mixing the concept of Identifying  NonIdentifying and Cardinality i.e. Genre  SubGenre, and doing so inconsistently to make things worse.li liAssociative Tables are not required in Logical Diagrams as their manytomany relationships can be depicted and then expanded in the Physical Model. li liI was overlooking the Cardinality in a lot of the relationshipsli liThe importance of reading through relationships using effective Verb Phrases to reassure I am modeling what I want to accomplish.li ol  pstrongU.2strong  In the concept of this model it is only required to track a Venue as a location for an Event.  No further data needs to be collected.  With that being said Events will take place on a given EventDate and will be hosted at a Venue.  Venues will host multiple events and possibly multiple events on a given date.  In my new model my thinking was that EventDate is already tied to Event .  Therefore, Venue will not need a relationship with EventDate.  The 5th and 6th bullets you have listed under U.2 leave me questioning my thinking though.  Am I missing something here p  pstrongU.3strong Is it time to move the link between Item and Band up to Item and Party instead  With the current design I dont see a possibility to sell merchandise not tied to the band as you have brought up. p  pstrongU.5strong I left as per your input rather than making it a discrete SupertypeSubtype Relationship as I dont see a benefit of having that type of roll up.  p  pstrongAdditional Revisionsstrongp  pstrongAR.1strong After going through the exercise for FavoriteItem, I feel that Item to Review requires a manytomany relationship so that is indicated.  Necessary img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZVV4I.png altenter image description herep  pstrongOk here we go for v1.3strongp  pI took a few days on this version, going back and forth with my design.  Once the logical process is complete, as I want to see if I am on the right track, I will go through in depth what I had learned and the troubles I faced as a beginner going through this process.  The big point for this version was it took throwing in some Keys to help see what I was missing in the past.  Going through the process of doing a matrix proved to be of great help also.  Regardless of anything, if it wasnt for the input given by PerformanceDBA I would still be a lost soul wondering in the dark.  Who knows my current design might reaffirm that I still am, but I have learned a lot so I am know I at least have a flashlight in my hand.  p  pAt this point in time I admit that I am still confused about identifying and nonidentifying relationships.  In my model I had to use nonidentifying relationships with non nulls just to join the relationships I wanted to model. In reading a lot on the subject there seems to be a lot of disagreement and indecisiveness on the subject so I did what I thought represented the right things in my model.  When to force identifying and when to be free nonidentifying Anyone have inputsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMRRA7.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDIT V1.4strongp  pOk took the V1.3 inputs and cleaned things up for this V1.4p  pCurrently working on a V1.5 to include attributes.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compboVs.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDIT V1.6strongp  pOkay, it has been some time since I have posted on here but the work on this project is still ongoing.  I am posting V1.6 now which includes a number of changes from the last posting of V1.4.  This version shows the further evolution of the Keys.  It still does not include the attributes or any AKs or IEs.  I have started working on the physical model and used that to help work through the attributes and to try and shed some light on the problems I am having with defining the AKs and IEs.

When I implemented RLE compression everything was smooth, because it process the input stream in one step. But Huffman process it twice and as a result I have an evaluated bytestring stored in memory, which is bad for a big files but for relatively small files it allocates too much space in heap too. That is not only my suspicion, because profiling also shows that most of the heap eaten by bytestring allocation. p  pAlso I seriallizing a stream length in file, and it also may cause the full bytestring loading in memory.

Negative 640 pI have an NSMutableArray that is loaded into a table view. The data in this array is basically storing the dates in the form i.e Sun, Mar 6, 2011, etc. The user adds these days by pressing an add button at the top of the nav bar and todays date is added. Now they will not necessarily add all the days of the week for a specific week i.e. they may miss adding a day. Therefore I cant assume that there are always 7 days 7 entries in the array until I hit a specific day of the week again i.e. from Sun, Mar 6, 2011 to Sun, Mar 13, 2011. Each entry in the array is storing an NSMutableDictionary with a bunch of data.

Negative 640 pIm working on a transactional inventory system for our ecommerce company, and Im looking for some sort of a guide or tutorial on how to accomplish this with a MySQL database. Theres guides on how to program, and guides on how to USE such systems, but Ive been unable to locate a resource with suggested table structures or best practices for implementing your own.p  pIn this system, all of the items are bought, stored, resold, then shipped no manufacturing. The system should support multiple Locations ie. Wisconsin, North Carolina. Each Location can have one or more Warehouses buildings next to each other. Each warehouse can have one or more Isles, with each Isle having one or more Shelves, and each shelf having one or more Bins. Merchandise is stored in bins, and each sizecolor variation has its own bin. Some items may be stored in more than one bin ie. if we get a discount by ordering 2000 at a time, we might stock 10 in a low bin and put the rest up on a high shelf in overstock.p  pStoring items in their respective locations is simple enough. I would probably have a Bins table likep  pre BinID     BinName            LocationID     WarehouseID    IsleID     ShelfID  1         Widget Bin A          1               1            1           1 2         Widget Bin B          1               2            2           5 3         Large Widget Rack     1               1            5           17 4         Widget Overstock      2               3            6           23  pre  pAnd then move items between Bins with an Inventory Transaction Table Likep  pre TransID   SourceBinID     DestBinID     QTY       Date      Memo     1          4              1          10     7222011    Moved 10 Widgets... pre  pBut heres where I get confusedp  pLets say that its midnight, and a customer orders 2 Widgets from the website. Theres 5 widgets in a bin. The customer has paid for his 2 widgets, so no one else can buy them, but its midnight and no one is working, so his widgets are still sitting in the bin. I need some sort of transaction that decreases the sellable number of widgets without decreasing the number actually on the shelf.p  pThe next day, an employee picks those widgets and moves them to the packing area. Now a physical transaction needs to occur to note that the items are now on a packing line and no longer in their bin. But packing needs to be a special location, since its not the same as a regular Bin, right So somehow we need to move things from a bin to a special nonbin location, and we need a transaction entry for doing that.p  pThen theres other special places like a return quarantine, and a place for setting aside items when other items for that order are on backorder.p  pIf you know of a book or online resource that can explain how to do this from a programmingdatabase standpoint, that would be great. Or if someone already knows how to do this and would be willing to share, that would be great toop  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve been giving this some more thought and its possible that the sellable inventory I think its called on hand could be calculated dynamically. Total of all bins  unfilled orders  on hand. The question is, is that going to be too slow to be practical It would need to perform several queries and then loop over the results to get the onhand total.p  pThe alternative might be to have a separate transaction table for onhand, but then you have two inventory journals an on hand and a physical. Even though they should always stay in sync if not its a bug it still doesnt feel rightp  pIm still not sure what to do about physical places. When you ship it, its gone from inventory, but for double entry style accounting it needs to go somewhere. So I would need some sort of gone bin. But it doesnt feel right to make gone and packing table bins either, because they arent actually bins.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strongp  pMovementsp  pre MoveID     TransID      SourceBinID     DestBinID      Memo     1          1              4              1          Moved 10 Widgets to bin 1    2          2              1              4          Received 10 Widgets from bin 4 pre  pIssuep  pre IssueID     TransID      SourceBinID        Memo     1          3              4              Shipped Widget to Customer    2          4              1              Shipped Widget to Customer pre  pTransactionsp  pre TransID          ItemID            Date         QTY     Type       1               1             7222011       10     Move         2               1             7222011      10     Move    3               1             7232011       1      Issue    4               1             7242011       2      Issue pre  pstrongUPDATE 4strongp  pOk, Im going to take another stab at this, without allocations for now.p  pLocations Table  A Location is a place where stuff can physically be.  p  pre        LocationID  LocationTypeID          LocationName     1                   1                   A Widget Bin     2                   1                   A Widget Bin 3                   1                   A Widget Bin 4                   1                   A Widget Bin 5                   5                   Vendor nowhere 6                   3                   Packing Table 1 7                   4                   Gone shipped to customer pre  pA location has a type.

Granted once you iron out these issues, you most likely wont see them again. Even still, most of these are actually caused by Hibernate since it insists on a specific Antlr version and so on.li ol  pAfter thinking about the problem... I could solve or at least improve the situation in all 3 of these areas if I just got rid of Hibernate. p  pHave any of you reworked a 50 entity java application to use mongo or couch or similar database What was the experience like Do you recommend it How long did it take you assuming you have some pretty great unitintegration tests Does the idea sound better than it really isp  pMy application would actually benefit in many areas if I could store documents.

Also, if this is a good idea, what books would you recommend I pick up to get me up to speed and really make use of them for this application in the best way possiblep  pThanksp

Negative 640 pI have an Oracle database that, like many, has a table containing biographical information. On which, I would like to search by name in a natural way.p  pThe table has codeforenamecode and codesurnamecode fields and, currently, I am using something like thisp  precodeselect id, forename, surname from   mytable where  upperforename like JOHN and    uppersurname like SMITH codepre  pThis works, but it can be very slow because the indices on this table obviously cant account for the preceding wildcard. Also, users will usually be searching for people based on what they tell them over the phone  including a huge number of nonEnglish names  so it would be nice to also do some phonetic analysis.p  pAs such, I have been experimenting with Oracle Textp  precodecreate index forenameFTX on mytableforename indextype is ctxsys.context create index surnameFTX on mytablesurname indextype is ctxsys.context  select   score1score2 relevance,          id,          forename,          surname from     mytable where    containsforename,john,1 gt 0 and      containssurname,smith,2 gt 0 order by relevance desc codepre  pThis has the advantage of using the Soundex algorithm as well as full text indices, so it emshouldem be a little more efficient. Although, my anecdotal results show it to be pretty slow The only apprehensions I have about this arep  ul lipFirstly, the text indices need to be refreshed in some meaningful way. Using codeon commitcode would be too slow and might interfere with how the frontend software  which is out of my control  interacts with the database so requires some thinking about...pli lipThe results that are returned by Oracle arent exactly very naturally sorted Im not really sure about this codescorecode function. For example, my development data is showing Jonathan Peter Jason Smith at the top  fine  but also Jane Margaret Simpson at the same level as John Terrance Smithpli ul  pIm thinking that removing the preceding wildcard might improve performance without degrading the results as, in real life, you would never search for a chunk in the middle of a name. However, otherwise, Im open to ideas... This scenario must have been implemented ad nauseam Can anyone suggest a better approach to what Im doingconsidering nowp  pThanks p

The stack trace gives the line System.Drawing.Bitmap..ctorType type, String resource as the point of failure.  See the code below.p  precodeImageList imageListNodes  new ImageList Bitmap mIcon mIcon  new Bitmapthis.GetType, m2.ico    This is the line that fails. imageListNodes.Images.Addm, ImagemIcon tvRecords.ImageList  imageListNodes    This is the treeview used in the form. codepre  pThe file m2.ico has been added directly to the project.  Its properties include Build Action  Embedded Resource, and Copy to Output Directory  Do not copy.p  pMy development computer is running Windows 7, and the production is Windows Server 2003 SP2, with a Citrix environment.  The project is in .NET 3.5, which they both have.  This form would be available on different client machines, so it should be able to work in Server 2003 and up.p  pThanks for any suggestionsp  pstrongEDITstrong A few minutes in and already its suggested that this setup wont work at all.  I noted above that this works on my computer both in Visual Studio debug mode, and when called on its own.  The icon files themselves are off on a network share, so there is no way that the DLL could be pulling them in the files must be embedded correctly, and the Bitmap  Icon conversion must be working correctly, or it wouldnt work at all on my machine.  p  pI appreciate the suggestions, and I am willing to try other methods of accomplishing the same goal, but please note that my initial question at least is why this works on my computer but not another one.  Thanksp
Negative 640 pIm currently working on an app using EF 4.1 Code First and have a question about how to save a new object with child objects from another context. The Context is stored in request mode.p  pI create a new object called Vacancy. The user is then prompted to add locations to the Vacancys collection of locations. The locations are pulled through the context and preferably  I would like to avoid saving locations added to the Vacancy back to the database until the user is finished which could potentially be after several postbacks.p  pProblem is that the Locations are from a context that does no longer exist so trying to save my vacancy will throw an error.p  pIm sure this is a common problem and I hope there is a good way to handle this.p  pKind regards,p

Negative 640 pI have a Delphi 6 application that ownerdraws icons in a TListBox row along with some text. The TListBoxs Style is set to lbOwnerDrawVariable.  The problem Im having is when an item is selected.  The highlight color used by the list box to change the background color of the selected row is making the icon look terrible because the icon has transparent pixels my assumption based on the visible evidence, and those pixels are changed to the background color thereby ruining the image.  Is there an easy way to force the transparent pixels to be drawn a certain color so I can eliminate this problem  I am using the TImageList.Draw method to draw the icon on the TListBox canvas.p

I could certainly use printf, but I thought there might be a cleaner way, using sed or awk. p  pThe reason I dont just want to use printf is because the apache config is about 20 lines long, and will take up most of the bash script, as well as make it harder to read.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 640 pSo the company I work for has quite an unorganized approach when it comes to our site.  All of our scripts are procedural with cfincludes thrown within.  Ive been wanting to organize this into an internal API that the other web developers would use to do whatever because making a change has me going thru and locating EVERY other instance that change needs to be updated.p  pI finally have a live example and showed the boss.  It follows what I assumed is the normal method from my googling.  Service layer  Gateway amp DAO  Beans, with some factories to help object creation.  It works well and does exactly what I had wanted it to accomplish.  Hes impressed with it and agrees that we need to spruce up our code and better organize it but doesnt see the advantage of using this method of object oriented API calls to a large list of cfincludes to accomplish the same thing.  In essence, from the way he explained the cfincludes, it would work the same way as a method call.p  pHes asked for the advantages of my approach vs this cfinclude and for the life of me I cant really find any obvious advantages other than grouping similar data all within one object.  Is there anything else or rather perhaps it would be advantageous to go with the cfinclude approachp

Negative 640 pIm learning a bit more about hadoop and its applications, and I understand it is geared toward massive datasets and large files. Lets say I had an application in which I was processing a relatively small number of files say 100k, which isnt a huge number for something like hadoophdfs. However, it does take a macro amount of time to run on a single machine, so Id like to distribute the process.p  pThe problem can be broken down into a map reduce style problem e.g. each of the files can be processed independently and then I can aggregate the results. Im open to using infrastructure such as Amazon EC2, but Im not so sure about what technologies to be exploring for actually aggregating the results of the process. Seems like hadoop might be a bit overkill here.p  pCan anyone provide guidance on this type of problemp

Negative 640 pWe have a very complex Oracle package here over 4,100 lines of code thats giving us issues.  Ive been tasked to track down the problem.  The issue is, when we call the codeexecutefiltercode procedure, we expect to get back 6 tables.  However, around 1015 times a day our code crashes because table index 1 is out of range.  When this repros, it seems to repro several times then a minute later, it works great again.  Ive still yet to be able to repro this under a debugger to see exactly what the data set is  but I have a theory the dataset is just a single empty table.p  pDigging through the Oracle package is almost impossible, as its all one big runon query with no formatting, no indention, and pages and pages of code that builds other queries by concatenating strings and what not.  However, I have a theory about whats going on.p  pThe codeexecutefiltercode method calls one or more of dozens of other methods, for example codefilterbyareasnamecode.  Each of these methods queries some data and inserts this data into a table called codetpmtempfilterprojectcode.  An example of this isp  precodeFOR I IN 1..areaState.COUNT LOOP    INSERT INTO tpmtempfilterproject           projectid,       versionid        SELECT .. Grabs the data it needs from other tables codepre  pAt the end of each of these filter calls, we call a procedure called codepopulateresulttablecode which copies stuff in codetpmtempfilterprojectcode into another table and then doesp  precodeEXECUTE IMMEDIATE truncate table tpmtempfilterproject codepre  pSo, my theory is that if two people run this query at the same time, the rows from these holder tables are getting truncated prematurely while another query still needs them.p  pWhats the best way to prevent this sort of thing from happening  One idea I had would be to putp  precodeLOCK TABLE tpmtempfilterproject IN EXCLUSIVE MODE codepre  pAt the very beginning of codeexecutefiltercode, and a codeCOMMITcode as the very last line.  In theory, this should only allow one person to run the command at the same time, and pending requests will block until the first filter is done.  I havent tried this yet, but I have a few questions.p  ol liIs this a good theory as to whats going onli liIs this a good fix, or is there a better solution to this issueli ol  pI appreciate any insight into this problem.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHeres the schema for the temp tablep  precodeCREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE TPMDBO.TPMTEMPFILTERPROJECT        PROJECTID   NUMBER NULL,     VERSIONID   NUMBER NULL       ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS codepre  pstrongANOTHER UPDATEstrongp  pThis does NOT appear to be a conflict between two sessions.  If I changep  precodeEXECUTE IMMEDIATE truncate table tpmtempfilterproject codepre  ptop  precodeDELETE tpmtempfilterproject codepre  pthen the error still occurs.  Even if I comment out that line completely, the error still eventually occurs.  There is nothing else in that package body that deletes, truncates, or modifies any other data what so ever.p  pSecond piece of evidence  I finally did repro the error under the Visual Studio debugger.  The DataSet in .NET is completely empty.  Theres one table called emtableem that has zero columns.  If this was an issue with one session deleting data in these temp tables, then I would expect a valid schema with zero rows or perhaps rows from the wrong session.p

Negative 640 pIve got a question about the architecture of a data structure Im writing. Im writing an image class, and Im going to use it in a specific algorithm. In this algorithm, I need to touch every pixel in the image thats within a certain border. The classic way I know to do this is with two nested for loopsp  precodeforint i  ROWBORDER i lt imggtheight  ROWBORDER i     forint j  COLBORDER j lt imggtwidth  COLBORDER j         WHATEVER  codepre  pHowever, Ive been told that in style of the STL, it is in general better to return an iterator rather than use loops as above. It would be very easy to get an iterator to look at every pixel in the image, and it would even be easy to incorporate the border constraints, but I feel like included the border is blowing loose coupling out of the water.p  pSo, the question is, should I return a special borderexcluding iterator, use the for loops, or is there a better way I havent thought ofp  pJust to avoid things like well, just use OpenCV, or VXL , Im not actually writing an image class, Im writing a differenceofgaussian pyramid for use in a feature detector. That said, the same issues apply, and it was simpler to write two for loops than three or four.p
Negative 640 pI have been through many posts on this site about listview with buttons and text view not being able to be selected. But my problem is different and Im not able to derive at a conclusion from other related posts.  I have a listview populated by a BaseAdapter. The list views layout is 2 textviews on the left and a button on the right for each row. I want the button as well as entire row of the listview to be able to selected.p  pI know the button when used is gaining focus. Can someone tell me how can i make both button as well as entire row  selectablep  pRegards, Ajithp

Negative 640 pIm a diehard .NET developer with limited experience in C.  Im really familiar with how happily interpreted languages and scripting languages work crossplatform, but what about Cp  pI realize that GCCGPP and some other compilers sorta work multiplatform with the right compiler flags, and I understand that the STL is normalized between compilers, but what else am I missing  Ill need to do audio inout, high accuracy timers, and Ill need to do multithreading.  I dont think any of these things are supported in the STL, so Ill be needing a crossplatform library of some type, right  Which one should I usep  pIm aiming to support the latest Mac and Windows platforms.  This is a shared frameworksdk and wont have a UI.  I plan on writing the UI in a native language such as ObjectiveCCocoa and .NETWPF both which have excellent native UI support.  p  pSo what should my tool chain look like  Should I be using GCCGPP or MinGW  What other libraries should I integrate that will function cross platform  Id like to setup my build environment to just work such that I can build a Mac compatible binary and a windows compatible binary 32 bit and 64 bit.  How can I do thatp  pAt this point, Ill be writing code for each platform so that I can interop with this my C multiplatform framework sdkapi thingy.  In windows, I think this will look like a managed DLL, is that right  Any thoughts on how Ill do this on a Macp  pAny suggestions or recommendationsp  pThanks for the suggestions, Brettp
Negative 640 pDisclaimer....Im new to Java and OOP.p  pI have a superclass with four subclasses. For each subclass, I need to parse an XML file. About 4050 of the elements in each XML are identical to one another, with the other half different for each subclass. p  pMy initial approach was to include the SAX parser handler code in the superclass and simply list all possible XML elements into it. But then I faced the issue of communicating the other 5060 of elements specific to the subclasses back down to the subclasses. Since the superclass does not know about each subclass I think, I think I would violate OOP principles if I somehow force that data down to the subclasses.p  pSo now Im thinking I might need to set up four different SAX parsers, one in each subclass. The super class would still be used for common instance variables and other methods. But I would also have quadruplication of some SAX parser code.p  pAny advice on how to proceed and stay true to OOP principles  p

Negative 640 pI have a website for which my crawler needs to follow a sequence. So for example, it needs to go a1, b1, c1 before it starts going a2 etc. each of a, b and c are handled by different parse functions and the corresponding urls are created in a Request object and yielded. The following roughly illustrates the code Im usingp  precodeclass aspiderBaseSpider      def parseself,response         yield Requestb, callbackself.parseb, priority10      def parsebself,response         yield Requestc, callbackself.parsec, priority20      def parsecself,response         finalfunction         codepre  pHowever, I find that the sequence of crawls seem to be a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3,c1,c2,c3 which is strange since I thought Scrapy is supposed to guarantee depth first.p  pThe sequence doesnt have to be strict, but the site Im scraping has a limit in place so Scrapy need to start scraping level c as soon as it can before 5 of level bs get crawled. How can this be achievedp
Negative 640 pIm trying to write a BASH script for patching my CentOS servers. My goal is that when I run the script, it outputs the package name, the currently installed version, and new package version. Something like thisp  precodenspr.x8664  4.8.83.el6  4.8.93.el62 codepre  pThis way, if I ever need to downgrade because a package broke something, I have a record of this.p  pThe command codeyum checkupdatecode command gives me the 1st piece of information the package name and the 3rd piece of information the new version listed above, and I can use codeawkcode to separate the two. Its easy after that just run coderpm q packagecode to get the 2nd piece of information, then concatenate them.p  pHowever, Im running into trouble with the codeforcode loop in my code. I need to pass multiple arguments into the loop the package name and newer version so I can codeechocode them later.p  pHeres my codep  precodefor package in usrbinyum cacheonly noplugins checkupdate  awk print 1, 2 do     OLDVERrpm q package  package should actually be 1 from the awk statement above      NEWVER2  This is 2 from the awk statement above      echo package  OLDVER  NEWVER done codepre  pPardon the obvious errors in the code Im new to BASH scripting. My confusion mostly stems from awk Im not very familiar with it, nor how it interacts with a BASH script. However, I think its clear what Im trying to do. Does codepackagecode get passed as an array Is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 640 pI have done the following so farp  ol liCreated workspaceli liAdded my projectli liAdded the Cocos2d iOS project by dragging dropping into project navigator. It is a sibling of my project not child.li liIn my project, in build phase, linked to libcocos2d.ali liIn build settings of my project  Set Always search paths to YESli liCreated source tree variable pointing to folder containing cocos2d iOS xcodeproj file.li liIn user header paths of my project, added source tree variable from step 6. Set as recursive. 8.In project navigator, clicked on libcocos2d.a library it appears red. Set location Relative to build products You set this in the right most window in Xcode 4.3.1.li liClosed workspace, and opened pbxproj file in TextWrangler. Searched for path containing libcocos2d.a Remove path, so the entry only reads libcocos2d.a . This is because after compiling the library is in the same build directory of the app anyway. li ol  pCodesense and autocomplete work. But this will not compile.

The cocos2d project by itself compiles amp builds fine. It is my project which has the above errors.p  pThe cocos2d library is present in the build directory of my app after I try to build.p  pEDIT Forgot to mention. I also edited the scheme for my project to not build in parallel. I also added the cocos2d target, and made it the top of the list so it should build first.p  pEDIT To clarify  after making the changes to the pbxproj file as detailed above, the libcocos2d.a file is no longer red. It looks normal. Also my app is also built, even though there are the link errors and the build fails. It doesnt actually build, but the product is not red. An app file is created in the same location as where the cocos2d library is produced.p

In my last codes, I wrote a new method which is like belowp  precoderegisterHider  function     alerthello      ifdocument.addEventListener         document.addEventListenerclick, hider, false       codepre  pThe method hider is another method which just changes display style to none. Thats all. When I comment out addEventListener code, page loads around 900ms again. But when I uncomment is it takes 6 secs again.p  pI put there an alert to see if page tries to process any code there on load, but no message comes to screen. From there I understand, codes are not executed yet. Even I changed code to register the event only if document is ready, no help, still same.p  pWhat can be the reason of this problemp
Negative 640 pIE8 has a horrible time collapsing a medium sized tree panel with multiple columns. It is way too slow. p  pI am looking for ways to speedup the transitions from expandAll to collapseAll states. One such way would seem to me is cancelling animation for IE8. It seems that in previous versions there were options that maybe specified on expandcollpase methods to enable or disable animation. However I dont see these options anymore. p  pHas anyone done this on 4.1xp
Negative 640 pI have been using KineticJS to build an iOS app UIWebView. I created a simple example app just to get an understand of memory utilization. I create a single stage, added 100 layers to it and one line to each layer. The amount of memory allocated for the stage and layers was about 6 Mb per layer or 600 Mb. I then added code to remove each layer in a setInterval function and then called stage.reset just to be sure. In profiling, the memory utilization did not reduce. p  pI reviewed my code to be sure I wasnt keeping references to the layers. In one test I also dereferenced the stage but the memory allocated value does not change. Could this be a bug or is there some other means to reclaim memory using KineticJSp

Negative 640 pIm developing restful android application, but Im still newbie to android, and I would like to avoid beginners bed structural design that would  cost me troubles latter. p  pIve read lots of discussions about android services and restful applications, many of them contrary to each other, so I would like to know have I choosen a good approach. p  pInspired by this presentation a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvxHXn3Kg2IQE relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvxHXn3Kg2IQEa I put my http requests into IntentServices, instead of the Async Task.  p  pIve choose Intent Service because of p  ul lias a services they are not sensitive to foregroundbackground switching like Activities wont get killed. li liIntent service provides work in separate thread, so the user interface stays responsive. li ul  pSince Intent Service cannot run multiple request simultaneously, Ive split my domain  into few groups and for each group I have written my Intent Service. ends up in one CRUD set  one intent service This way I got that inside of a group can be only one request running at a time And this is good for me, since this way it could never be executed for example update and delete at same unit. And, on the other side, I can run multiple requests at the same time if they are from the other groups, and dont affect each other. p  pSo basically, I have this p  ul lipone generic HTTPRequest class that builds requests from name value pairs pli lipUserIntentService  creates user related requests and executes it by using HTTPRequest cass, and proccess request using UserProcessor. Notifies caller by intent with data.pli lipCallIntentService  creates call related requests and executes it by using HTTPRequest cass  and proccess request using CallProcessor. Notifies caller by intent with data. pli lipUserProcessor  parsing responsepli lipCallProcessor  parsing responsepli lipServiceHelper  finds and starts right intent service pli ul  pWhen using from activity, I use something like this SeviceHelper.StartService action, data,  and I get response by local BroadcastReceiver inside of the activity. I register receiver on the OnStart, and unregister it on the onStop method of the activity.p  pIs that a good approach p  pShould I have only one IntentService for all calls  Is it better to have   one Service that runs all the time in background, instead of using Intent Service that has to be started for each request p  pIs there any other things that can get bad with this approach that Im missingp

Where the entities are strongfor examplestrong trees that can be cut. I need to store the data how many chops are left for example for each entity. I want them to have a more dynamic position doubles and a more dynamic spritewidth and height.

In this case a character behind the tree will cannot be rendered in or in front of the tree. This case also applies to other objects of the same kind like trees. I think it might be too inefficient to loop through the entities and calculate each entitys  position since there may be a LOT of entites in the level.p  pAs Ive done some research I found that certain libraries allow the storage of both the object and its position in a MAP BiMap in googles Guava.p  h2strongQuestionsstrongh2  ul liIs this an inefficient manner.. but are there some changes that canbr be applied to make the rendering more efficient if so, what could be optimizedli liOr is this an inefficient manner to render the entities    and is there a better way if so, what other methods are there in    Javali liOr is there something else that I havent listedli ul  pstrongEDIT2strong I looked through the link Ive posted in the edit below.

There must be some simple method that I am overlooking to complete this and Im having some trouble finding a great way to do it.p  pIve attempted adding an animated class to the element, which is removed when the animation is completed, and then using codesetTimeoutcode to check if the class is still there after 400 milliseconds, but I was having some trouble with that method working in IE8.p  pNot really sure of anything else I can try and if anyone has any suggestions Id greatly appreciate the assistance.p  pThe provided JSFiddle provides a basic idea of what I am trying to do..

Negative 640 pI had previously thought that if you check the box for a file to add it to a target, then that is how it gets included in the application bundle. I have some audio files that I decided not to use and I unchecked them from the Target Membership. They are also not codeincludecode or codeimportcode anywhere. I cleaned the Xcode project using the Product menu and also deleted its derived data. As a test I did not remove lines like thisp  precodeNSURL fileurl  [[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourcefileName ofTypefileSuffix]] pcmData  MyGetOpenALAudioDataAllCFURLReffileurl, ampdatasize, ampalformat, ampsamplerate codepre  pWhere codefileNamecode and codefileSuffixcode refer to these files that are no longer included in the target.p  pHowever, surprisingly, these files still load and play back fine.p  pSo apparently, files get included in an application bundle in another way besides the target membership checkbox. How is this happeningp

Ive used JSON.stringified, Ive not used JSON.stringified, Ive used jsondecode, Ive just done printrPOST...Ive done so many things that I am completely unable to analyze what is affecting what in order to diagnose what the problem might be. It seems my .ajax POSTS might be wrong, it seems my PHP might be wrong. So here are the questions I would GREATLY appreciate being answeredp  p1 Is the codedivisionscode array being created by the javascript considered JSON, or in a format easily converted to JSON   p  p2 What does my AJAX call need to be I have tried so many AJAX calls that I have NO idea what is considered rightwrong. Also, please use codedivisionscode and not the snippet of the array I provided above, as the codedivisionscode array is dynamically generated by whats contained in codedivisionsLargecode. p  p3 What does my codedivisions.phpcode PHP file need to look like Right now it has an HTML skeleton around it with codeltscriptgtltscriptgtcode tags that reference codedivisionsLarge.jscode and codedivisions.jscode [do these need to be in one code.jscode file] I have seen blank pages and codeArraycode for so long that Im even doubting the rest of the PHP file now.p  p4 How do I get, for example, the color value of the first index This seems rudimentary but most examples that I see are just querying an array of just one object, e.g. codeecho POST[color]code, but I have multiple entries of codecolorcode, so Im not sure how to just ask for the first one. I would like to know this mostly because I have had such bad success with testing whether the array is working or not  I have lost all faith in codeprintrPOSTcode and codevardumpjsoncode.p

Negative 640 pI have a Hash Map with Keys objects of type Request and Values of type Integer. I use the following code to iterate through the map and get ALL the minimum values and then add their keys to a list. I emphasize to ALL because the keys are unique but the values can be duplicate, therefore there may be more than one map elements with the minimum value. p  pHowever, this code gives me only a single such element, that is, the first that it finds through the iteration, even though I know there are more. For example, let us say that the map has the following requests  i.e. keys I give the request IDs 3  5  2 and their respective values are 8  4  4. Thus, at this example we have two minimum elements, that is, two elements that share the minimum value, ID 5 and ID 2, both with value 4.

Negative 640 pThis is my graphic design portfolio site and Im having a bit of trouble with my filter. Ive created it using jQuery and classes. When one clicks on a link it hides all the .tags that arent it. All of this works correctly. Lines 519p  pStarting on line 21, Ive created a function that dynamically adds a div and content below the item. It finds how many elements exist, the position of the current element, and finds the position the new div should be inserted at the end of the 3 column row. All of this works correctly on its own.p  pstrongThe problem is that when some .tags are filtered, the second function doesnt correctly find the position of the current element.strong Its because Im not actually removing the elements from the source code, simply hiding them  I want to keep it that way so I dont need to keep reloading the content.p  precodevar portfolio  portfolio gt a var elements  portfolio.childrenvisible.length finds how many elements are in the portfolio var getPosition  portfolio.siblingsa visible.addBack.indexthis  find the position of the div  codepre  pThe above code is the problem area lines 2526, but heres the entire code for reference a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netcQUMs5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netcQUMs5ap  pMy variable emelementsem has no trouble getting the correct number of elements whether the filter is used or not. strongemgetPositionem gets the right position before anything is filtered, but retains that number I need it to update dynamically.strongp

However, when I try to expand the buffer and free the old smaller buffer, I get invalid next size errors from gilbc.p  pMy expand function is as followsp  precodecbuf expandBuffercbuf cbptr       int newSize     newSize  cbptrgtmaxSize  2 1     cbuf tempBuffer  mallocsizeofcbuf  newSize  sizeofquote     tempBuffer gtmaxSize  cbptrgtmaxSize  2     tempBuffer gtstart  cbptrgtstart     tempBuffer gtend  cbptrgtend     tempBuffer gtfreeSlots  tempBuffergtmaxSize  cbptrgtmaxSize      int x     int counter     counter  0      forx  cbptrgtend x lt cbptrgtmaxSize x           tempBuffergtquoteBuffer[counter].time  cbptrgtquoteBuffer[x].time         tempBuffergtquoteBuffer[counter].rate  cbptrgtquoteBuffer[x].rate         counter           int y     fory  0 y lt cbptrgtstart y           tempBuffergtquoteBuffer[counter].time  cbptrgtquoteBuffer[y].time         tempBuffergtquoteBuffer[counter].rate  cbptrgtquoteBuffer[y].rate         counter           tempBuffergtstart  cbptrgtmaxSize     tempBuffergtend  0     freecbptr     return tempBuffer   codepre  pand my update function is as followsp  precodevoid cbufupdatecbuf cbptr, unsigned int time, double rate      Code      ifcbptrgtfreeSlots  0         printfnnEXPANDING CIRCULAR BUFFERnn         cbptr  expandBuffercbptr                More code here edited out since it doesnt pertain to question.  codepre  pand finally my mainp  precodeint main      cbuf cb1      cb1  cbufinit      cbufupdatecb1, 60, 1.291      cbufupdatecb1, 63, 1.287      cbufupdatecb1, 63, 1.231      cbufupdatecb1, 69, 1.229      cbufupdatecb1, 72, 1.247      cbufupdatecb1,361,1.291     cbufupdatecb1, 411, 1.291      cbufupdatecb1, 412, 1.281      cbufupdatecb1, 413, 1.292      cbufupdatecb1, 414, 1.284      cbufupdatecb1, 414, 1.290      cbufupdatecb1, 511, 1.241      cbufupdatecb1, 512, 1.251      cbufupdatecb1, 513, 1.232      cbufupdatecb1, 514, 1.202      cbufupdatecb1, 517, 1.119      cbufupdatecb1, 551, 1.080      cbufupdatecb1, 552, 1.081      cbufupdatecb1, 553, 1.079      cbufupdatecb1, 554, 1.088      cbufupdatecb1, 561, 1.072      cbufupdatecb1, 562, 1.113      cbufupdatecb1, 563, 1.091      cbufupdatecb1, 564, 1.092      cbufupdatecb1, 571, 1.089      cbufupdatecb1, 572, 1.073      cbufupdatecb1, 573, 1.061      cbufupdatecb1, 574, 1.111      cbufupdatecb1, 581, 1.119      cbufupdatecb1, 582, 1.123      cbufupdatecb1, 583, 1.151      return 0  codepre  pThis segfaults at the linep  precodecbuf tempBuffer  mallocsizeofcbuf  newSize  sizeofquote codepre  pin expandBuffer AFTER it has already expanded once successfully.

Negative 640 pIve created a simple captcha system in my assp.net web application, I use an ASPX page as ImageUrl of my captcha image, this ASPX file creates captcha image and returns it to be used as my image source.

When the state of the checkboxes changes, the button should become enabled and when clicked become disabled until the state of the checkboxes changes again.  If you change the state of the checkboxes but then change it back to its inital state, the button will enabledisable appropriately.  The app works as expected, I am just trying to figure out whyhow.p  pNow the questionsp  ul lipWill the SelectMany call be triggered whenever the initialState or a check box change occurspli lipThe first call of initialState.OnNextinitialState in the constructor doesnt really do anything when it comes to the SelectMany code.  I see it makes its way to the SelectMany code but nothing is actually done I mean, if I put a breakpoint on the checkBoxChanges.Select section it breaks but nothing is actually selected.  Is this because no changes have occured to any of the checkboxes yetpli lipAs expected, checking any checkBox triggers the isDirty check.  What exactly is happening in this SelectMany statement the first time I change a single checkbox  pli lipAfter checking a box, the Apply button becomse enabled and I hit Apply.  This causes initialState.OnNextnewState to be called.  Similar to my first question, nothing seems to happen in the SelectMany statement.  I thought with the initial state getting a new value something would get recalculated but it seems to go straight to the OnNext handler of isDirty.Subscribed  IsDirty  dpli lipNow that I hit Apply, initialState.OnNext has been called twice in total.  If I check a new checkbox, how does the SelectMany handle that  Does it go through all of the past states of initialState  Are those values stored until the observable is disposedpli lipWhat are the StartsWithTakeUntilSkip lines doing  I noticed that if I remove the TakeUntil line, the app stops working correctly as the SelectMany clause starts going through all the past values of initialState and gets confused as to which is the actual current state to compare to.pli ul  pPlease let me know if you need additional info.p

Negative 640 pIm looking for a possiblity to monitor all messages in a SOA enviroment with an intermediary, wholl be designed to enforce different rulesets over the messages structure and sequences e.g., lets say itll check and ensure that Service A has to be consumed before B.p  pObviously the first idea that came to mind is how WSAdressing might help here, but Im not sure if it does, as I dont really see any mechanism there to ensure that a message will get delivered via a given intermediary as it is in WSRouting, which is an outdated proprietary protocol by Microsoft.p  pOr maybe theres even a different approach that the monitor wouldnt be part of the route but would be notified on requestresponses, which might it then again make somehow harder to actively enforce rules.p  pIm looking forward to any suggestions.p

Negative 640 pFirst and foremost Id like to state that Im a beginner to programming. I was unable to find advice specifically about what Im wondering.p  pIm learning C through several books and am always putting into use what Im learning by coming up with my own little ideas and coding them to the best of my ability. One such thing I thought of was a short textbased RPG with branching choices. In this RPG you have several different races and professions to choose from when you create your character. Its organized into several events, which may be influenced by your previous actions or even by your characters attributes  for example, if you picked option 3 in the first event, you might unlock an extra option in the second event. Or if your character is an X, you might be missing an option that others have.p  pI originally started with this only a few days after I started learning and coded around 4 such events in, it was fairly bugfree but the code was very messy. Now that Im getting into objectoriented programming, I decided to redo this program with classes. What Ive coded so far is a Character class, containing data members such as race, profession, gender, and so forth, as well as member functions to get and set all of these, and a constructor initializing the creation Ill add the entire class at the end of this post so you can examine that too, and point out any flaws or how it could be improved. The only thing I have in the main function is calling the charCreate function. p  pBasically, I do not know exactly where to go from here. I want to take a purely objectoriented approach to this. Should I make another events class Should the events be part of the Characters class How would I induce the branching using OOP methods p  pI emphasize the point of this question is to get advice from those with experience who can help set me on the right path and provide me with valuable advice that will help me grow as a learner.p  pThanksp  pCharacter.Hp  precodeifndef CHARACTERH define CHARACTERH include ltstringgt  using namespace std  class Character      public these are fairly self explanatory... setget functions for the data members     Character             void charCreate     void setNamestring     void setGenderint     void setRaceint     void setProfint     string getName     string getGender     string getRace     string getProf private     string charName character name     string charGender character gender     string charRace   character race     string charProf    character profession     int charGold  50  initial gold amount     int charMana   this is only relevant for wizards, doesnt matter for other professions     string profWep professionexclusive weapons    endif  CHARACTERH codepre  pCharacter.cppp  precodeinclude Character.h include ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt  using namespace std  CharacterCharacter  CharactercharCreate   constructor initializes the character creation function below  void CharactercharCreate  string name bool gender int race int prof     cout ltlt nnnnFirst, what is your name 23 characters max  getlinecin,name  setNamename  cout ltlt nnAre you male or female 0 for female, 1 for male cin gtgt gender     while gender gt 1  gender lt 0         cout ltlt nnInvalid.

Negative 640 pConsider a case where one needs to verify a type codeTcode with another template codegcode could be some codeenableifcode expression, for example inside a dummy parameter of another template, like thisp  precodetemplateltclassgt        struct g  typedef void type  templateltclass, classgt struct f  templateltclass Tgt      struct fltT, voidgt                    Case A templateltclass Tgt      struct fltT, typename gltTgttypegt    Case B  int main  fltint, voidgt test  codepre  pHere, for the sake of simplicity codegcode doesnt really do anything.  The second parameter in strongCase Bstrong is in a nondeduced context, therefore intuitively one would think that strongCase Bstrong is more specialized than strongCase Astrong.  Sadly, both gcc and clang will complain that the template is ambiguous in the instantiation above.p  pIf the dummy parameter were to be removed, then it compiles just fine.

Negative 640 pI have two tables in a mySQL database and I want to do a join on them. Imagine both of them have 3000 entries. When mySQL executes the query, it will return 30003000 possible rows. I would like to run the query on one table and return each row as soon as it finds a match in the second table so if it finds a matching row in row number two of t2, it can skip the other possibile combinations. For example, this would be something like this p  pselect  from t1 where emat least one matchemt1.id  t2.id p  pIs there any way in mySQL to do thisp  pI am aware that usually such joins should be avoided, but in this case I do not have alternatives. p
Negative 640 pI have a ListView populated by a ResourceCursorAdapter. I use the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidecomponentsloaders.html relnofollowloadersa mechanism to query a ContentProvider for list items. I detect swipe gestures on the list items to perform some actions on them. New items get added by a background service, so the list can change dynamically.p  pEverything works fine, except when I start swiping and a database change occurs as a result of the background service adding a new row. In such case the gesture is not detected properly. I noticed that ACTIONCANCEL is dispatched to the list item view and also that bindView is executed for all visible items. Inside the bindView method I only set some text  I dont change any listeners there.p  pHow can I make gestures work even when new items are being added by the background service Perhaps theres a way to prevent the motion from being cancelled or I can pause database updates so they dont interrupt the gesture.p

Negative 640 pThe target application can be used in pipe mode, which means it accepts input from stdin, and can output into stdout.p  pHowever, there is always a risk of a user making a mistake, directing output to stdout, without actually directing stdout towards something a file, or a consumer program. As a consequence, the console screen gets garbaged displaying binary data since by default, stdout outputs to the screen.p  pBottom line  I want to avoid binary output to be displayed into the console, automatically. It must be done in strongportable Cstrong, and not depend on external script.p  pA few potential ways of doing it p  p1 Is it possible to detect that stdout is going to console, in order to redirect it somewhere else instead  including devnul.

Negative 640 pI have a process that is continually writing new files to a directory.  When the current file reaches a certain size, it creates a new one with the timestamp.  Like rolling log files, for example.p  pWhen the process closes the current file A and creates a new one, I would like to move A to a new directory for processing.  Im not sure of the best way to do this...p  pI wrote a bash script that runs every few minutes, lists all the files in the dir sorted by time, and moves all but the most recent.  This works, but I cant help but feel like there is a better way, something more eventdriven.  I was looking at using inotifywait and capturing the CLOSEWRITE,CLOSE event for the file ...p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 640 pI have a UITextField with a Clear button. Whenever the user resigns first responder on the textfield, it submits the change to a webservice. p  pWhen the user taps the clear button, seemingly, the textfield loses its first responder status, causing the didEndEditing delegate method to be called. So the webservice call is made, with the old, populated value. Then, the textfield is cleared, calling didEndEditing again, calling the webservice again.p  pWhy does this happen this way I would expect the clear button to empty the text and then call didEndEditing on the delegate so you only get one message.p

Negative 640 pI have a C Windows Forms Application with a webBrowser within it. It visits a Wikia chatroom, where it then locates the element which contains the chat output. This element looks likep  precodeltdiv style idChatXXXXX classChatgt  ltulgt   chat text  ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe purpose of the program is to retrieve the chat text every once in a while for logging purposes. This is easily done by parsing the InnerHtml of the ChatXXXXX element. However, I also need to clear the text from the window when I do this for various reasons, I cannot leave the text in the window. I figured I would just erase the chat text portion of the element, as this is how it is done with a handy javascript file called chat hacks for Wiki chat a hrefhttpsdb.tt66q8UQbY relnofollow titlechatHacksFull.jsherea. Or at least, I think thats how it does it. If you look at the function clearWindow in that file, you can see what it doesp  precodeNodeChatController.prototype.clearWindow  function    this.viewDiscussion.chatUL.html   this.inlineAlerti18n[cleared]  codepre  pI have tried setting the InnerHtml of ChatXXXXX using the following three strings not all at the same time, of coursep  precodeHtmlDocument document  webBrowser1.Document document.GetElementByIdChatXXXXX.InnerHtml   document.GetElementByIdChatXXXXX.InnerHtml  ltulgtltulgt document.GetElementByIdChatXXXXX.InnerHtml  ltulgtltli classinlinealertgt Window cleared. ltligtltulgt codepre  pHowever, although these clear the window and in the case of the last one prints a message, strongthe chat no longer updates as new messages show upstrong. The only fix is to reload the page, which isnt an option, because reloading the page brings in a whole load of chat history which Im trying to avoid. Ive also tried importing that javascript mentioned above into the page usingp  precodeHtmlElement head  webBrowser1.Document.GetElementsByTagNamehead[0] HtmlElement scriptEl  webBrowser1.Document.CreateElementscript scriptEl.SetAttributetype, textjavascript scriptEl.SetAttributesrc, httpsdb.tt66q8UQbY head.AppendChildscriptEl codepre  pThis javascript creates a button which clears the chat window. The button clears the window just fine, but again, the chat no longer updates. I know this button works correctly without stopping further incoming chat in regular browsers Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc. Ive used it many times, and the script itself is quite popular in the Wikia community. Ive already followed the steps here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18333459csharpwebbrowserajaxcall1833398218333982WPF WebBrowser Control  positionfixed Element jumps while scrolling Windows 8a to get the browser to act as close as it can  to Internet Explorer. Ive already checked the Body field of the document after altering the InnerHtml to make sure that my replacements didnt alter anything important. Just for clarity, heres an example of what is contained in the chat text portion of my original examplep  precodeltli classyou datauserUserNameHere identryc812gt   ...avatars and junk...   ltspan classmessagegthelloltspangt ltligt codepre  pI honestly have no idea what could be causing the chat element to stop updating after it has been edited especially since it works outside of this program, so I dont know what information to include. Whatever you need, Ill provide it. Heres the javascript from Wikia which generates the chat output window a hrefhttpslot1.images1.wikia.nocookie.netam62424groupchatjs2 relnofollowchatjs2a. Look for Chat to find the part which originally generates the window. I dont know where the output is updated in that file though.p

Negative 640 pI would like to use the codeAnimatorListenerAdaptercode, specified herep  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidanimationAnimatorListenerAdapter.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidanimationAnimatorListenerAdapter.htmlap  pBut, it implements the codeAnimatorListenercode interface. On a codeViewcode, such as an codeImageViewcode, there is a method called codesetAnimationListenercode, but it takes, as a parameter, an codeAnimationListenercode. There doesnt seem to be an associated codeAnimationListenerAdaptercode available.p  pMy question is what is the difference between codeAnimatorListenercode and codeAnimationListenercode, and why do the two separate interfaces exist It seems like they both provide the same functionality. The only difference I can see is that one of them was introduced in a later API version.p

Negative 640 pI am new to objectivec and iOS programming and have been trying to setup this gpslocation app from scratch for the past 3 hours using xcode 5 and an iOS7 iPhone. So far the app successfully loads on my iphone. The user interface has an empty label and a button. When I tap the button, it says YourGPSApp would like to use your current location and then has a Dont allow and an OK option.p  pHowever, the window goes away before you can even select one of the options. I need the window to stay and let the user select an option.p  pHere is what I have done so farp  ol lipCreated a property for IBOutlet UILabel object in the header file and connected it with the user interface.pli lipDefined an IBAction method in the header file and connected it with the button on the UI.pli ol  pThis is the final result in my header filep  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  interface ViewController  UIViewController  property nonatomic, strong IBOutlet UILabel gpsLabel  IBActiongpsButton  end codepre  pAnd then I edited the main file and ended up with this source codep  precodeimport ViewController.h import ltCoreLocationCoreLocation.hgt  interface ViewController    end  implementation ViewController   voidviewDidLoad   [super viewDidLoad]     voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning  [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]  Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.

Negative 640 pUsually we can set up a proxy server by some kind of tools such as CCProxy which provides proxy services for HTTP, SOCKS, FTP packets etc. Also, Proxifier or Proxycap is used to forward the packets of specific application on the client PC. However, when UDP packets are forwarded to the proxy server, these packets cannot be correctly forwarded to the destination originally the application wanted them to go. When I use a network analyzer to observe the UDP traffic flow, the UDP packets are just passed to the proxy server from my PC without going to the correct destination finally.p  pBesides, someone suggested that the UDP relay is not enabled in the proxy server so the UDP packets cannot be routed successfully. How can I enable the UDP relay function on the proxy serverAssume that I can control the proxy server completelyp

My text string of the UILabel is hiding behind UIView, so it is not displayed. p  pId love to show you pictures, but I am new and I cannot add pictures until I get to 10 reputations.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comCdRjy.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comCdRjy.pnga a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comzCdCV.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comzCdCV.pnga p  pHere is my code for setting the text and the viewp  pBubbleViewp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect      const CGFloat boxWidth  self.bubbleWidth     const CGFloat boxHeight  self.bubbleHeight      NSLogtext, width, height , f, f, self.text, self.bubbleWidth, self.bubbleHeight      CGRect boxRect  CGRectMake                                 roundfself.bounds.size.width  boxWidth  2.0f,                                 roundfself.bounds.size.height  boxHeight  2.0f,                                 boxWidth,                                 boxHeight      UIBezierPath roundedRect  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRectboxRect cornerRadius14.0f]     [[UIColor colorWithWhite0.3f alpha0.8f] setFill]     [roundedRect fill]      NSDictionary attributes                                    NSFontAttributeName  [UIFont systemFontOfSize16.0f],                                  NSForegroundColorAttributeName  [UIColor whiteColor]                                        CGPoint textPoint  CGPointMake                                     self.center.xboxWidth2,                                     self.center.yboxHeight2     NSLogtext point origin f, f, textPoint.x, textPoint.y      [self.text drawAtPointtextPoint withAttributesattributes]  codepre  pMain View Controllerp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Do any additional setup after loading the view.     self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor whiteColor]     [self setText]       void viewDidLayoutSubviews       [super viewDidLayoutSubviews]      [self setText]     void setText      NSString textR  I need this text to show up on autolayout so that i could continue working       UIFont font  [UIFont fontWithNameHelveticaNeue size14.0f]     CGSize constraint  CGSizeMake250,9999     CGRect textRect  [textR boundingRectWithSizeconstraint                                           optionsNSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin                                        attributesNSFontAttributeNamefont                                           contextnil]      BubbleView hostView  [[BubbleView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake20.0f, 160.0f, textRect.size.width20, textRect.size.height20]     hostView.bubbleWidth  textRect.size.width20     hostView.bubbleHeight  textRect.size.height20     hostView.text  textR     hostView.layer.cornerRadius  10.0f     self.view.layer.masksToBounds  TRUE     [hostView drawRecttextRect]     hostView.backgroundColor  [UIColor whiteColor]     self.detailsView  hostView      self.detailsView.backgroundColor  [UIColor whiteColor]     NSLogsize f, f, textRect.size.width, textRect.size.height      NSLogorigin f, f  size f, f, backgroundColor , self.detailsView.frame.origin.x, self.detailsView.frame.origin.y, self.detailsView.frame.size.width, self.detailsView.frame.size.height, self.detailsView.backgroundColor      [self.view addSubviewself.detailsView]     self.hostSays.text  textR     self.hostSays.textColor  [UIColor blueColor]     [self.view layoutSubviews]   codepre  pSOLUTION ONLY 1 PART  OK so I managed to solve half of my problems.

Negative 640 pHI I have a lot of classes and which are sending requests and finally it all comes to SplitViewController .in the SplitUIviewclass i have to longpoll and write the data in a table view . the long polling is done in the background thread . So i have declared a variable in app delegate but when it comes to that it is nil. And the problem is that whenever i try to access the  NSMutablearray through the appdelegate its coming as nil and the array is being released. my code for long polling is p  precode void longPoll   autoreleasePool  compose the request NSError error  nil NSURLResponse response  nil NSURL requestUrl  [NSURL URLWithStringhttpwww.mysite.compollUrl] NSURLRequest request  [NSURLRequest requestWithURLrequestUrl]  send the request will block until a response comes back NSData responseData  [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequestrequest                         returningResponseampresponse erroramperror]  pass the response on to the handler can also check for errors here, if you want [self performSelectorOnMainThreadselectordataReceived        withObjectresponseData waitUntilDoneYES]     send the next poll request [self performSelectorInBackgroundselectorlongPoll withObject nil]    void startPoll   [self performSelectorInBackgroundselectorlongPoll withObject nil]    void dataReceived NSData theData  i write data received here to app delegate table  codepre  pif i call any other method in my splitview class from data received am i losing control also i cannot print my app delegate values in     datareceived  . or are the variables being released. i cannot call reload table or any other method from here.p  pits really late ill post the whole code tomorrow.

Negative 640 pIm basically trying to remove a bit from an integer at a specific index. That is, I do not want to unsetclear the bit I actually want to strip it, so that every higher bit moves down, replacing the respective bit at its position. Visually, this could be compared to deleting an element from an array or removing a character from a string.br For the sake of clarity, some examplesp  precode1011011 original number      index  2 0101111 result  10000000000000000000000000000001  index  31 00000000000000000000000000000001  1111111111111111111111111111110                                index  0 0111111111111111111111111111111 codepre  pFull of confidence, I started shifting some bits, and came up with the following Java method...p  precodepublic static int removeBitint num, int i      int out  num gtgtgt i  1 ltlt i     out   num ltlt 32  i gtgtgt 32  i     return out  codepre  p...which almost always works, except for some extreme casesp  precode10000000000000000000000000000001  Integer.MAXVALUE  1  index  31, results in 10000000000000000000000000000001  1011011        index  0, results in 1111111 codepre  pIn other words, if the index is 0 or 31 least or most significant bit, my method will output garbage.br I cant seem to wrap my head around it, and thats why Im asking  p  pHow can I remove an arbitrary bit in a 32bit integerbr Im especially looking for the most performant way to do it in Java smallest possible memory and CPU consumption, since this operation has to run at least a couple million times. Thats why something like convert it into a string, remove the char and convert it back is out of the question.p

It means I can go to my commandline, type python scrapymanager.py and have all of my spiders do their thing, each with different arguments passed at their command line, and download their data to the correct placep  precodescrapymanager  from random import randint from time import sleep from subprocess import call  free call[scrapy crawl swimspider a lowage20 a highage25 a sexW a StrkDist10025 o free.json t json], shellTrue sleeprandint15,45  breast call[scrapy crawl swimspider a lowage20 a highage25 a sexW a StrkDist30025 o breast.json t json], shellTrue sleeprandint15,45  back call[scrapy crawl swimspider a lowage20 a highage25 a sexW a StrkDist20025 o back.json t json], shellTrue sleeprandint15,45  fly call[scrapy crawl swimspider a lowage20 a highage25 a sexW a StrkDist40025 o fly.json t json], shellTrue sleeprandint15,45 codepre  pSo rather than spending hours trying to rig up a complicated single spider that crawls each form in succession in my case different swim strokes, this is a pretty painless way to run many many spiders all at once I did include a delay between each scrapy call with the sleep functions.p  pHopefully this helps someone.p

In order to not trigger unnecessary transfers when no relevant data has changed to these external systems, we have an export table which contains all the information any customer is interested in and a service which runs SQL queries defined in a file to compare the data in the export table to the data in the other tables and update the export table as appropriate, a solution were not really happy with for several reasonsp  ul liNo customer uses more than a fraction of these columns, although each column is used by at least one customer.li liAs the database grows, the service is causing increasing amounts of strain on the system. Some servers completely freeze while this service compares data, which may take up to 2 minutes  even though no customer has particularly large amounts of data 15000 rows across all relevant tables, max. We fear what might happen if we ever get a customer with very large amounts of data. Performance could be improved by creating some indexes and improving the SQL queries, but we feel like thats attacking the problem from the wrong direction.li liIts not very flexible, nor scalable. Having to add new columns every time a customer is interested in transferring data that no other customer has been interested in before which happens a lot, just feels... icky. I dont know how much it really matters, but were up to 37 columns in this table at the moment, and it keeps growing.li ul  pstrongWhat we want to dostrongp  pInstead, we would like to have a very slimmed down export table which only contains the bare minimum information, i.e. the table and primary key of the row that was updated, the system this row should be exported to, and some timestamps. A trigger in every relevant table would then update this export table whenever a column that has been configured to warrant an update is updated. This configuration should be read from another table which, sometime in the future, could be configured from our web GUI, looking something like thisp  precode  system   table   column      sys1  tbl1  column1    sys2  tbl1  column2   codepre  pNow, the trigger in tbl1 will read from this table when a row is updated. The configuration above should mean that if column1 in tbl1 has changed, then an export row for sys1 should be updated, if column2 has changed too, then an export row for sys2 should also be updated, etc.p  pSo far, it all seems doable, although a bit tricky when youre not an SQL genius. However, we would preferably like to be able to define a little bit more complex conditions, at least something like column3  Apple OR column3  Banana, and this is kind of the heart of the question...p  pSo, to sum it upp  ul liWhat would be the best way to allow for triggers to be configured in this wayli liAre we crazy Are triggers the right way to go here, or should we just stick to our service, smack on some indexes and suck it up Or is there a third alternativeli liHow much of a performance increase could we expect to see Is this all worth itli ul

For instances before SU the EVENTID value should be the highest, and for instances after SU the EVENTID value should be the lowest.p  precodeCAREID EVENTID  EVENTDATE        EVENTTYPE 3       189       15042010 0000  SU 3       104       12052010 0000  CH 3       16        12072010 0000  BR 3       17        13072010 0000  BR 3       18        13072010 0000  BR 39      6         21072009 0000  CH 39      45        09102009 0000  TE 78      9         28072009 0000  TE 78      11        28072009 0000  CH 95      21        31072009 0000  CH 95      21        31072009 0000  TE 151     49        21032010 0000  TE 217     158       18022010 0000  SU 217     102       30032010 0000  CH 355     19        13072010 0000  BR 355     20        13072010 0000  BR 355     21        13072010 0000  BR 355     22        13072010 0000  BR 355     23        13072010 0000  BR 355     56        16072010 0000  TE 355     111       16072010 0000  CH 364     569       29012011 0000  SU 364     673       24082012 0000  TE 367     247       01072010 0000  SU 369     117       28072010 0000  CH 369     248       28072010 0000  SU 380     277       08072011 0000  TE 631     147       25122009 0000  CH 631     74        15012010 0000  TE 631     148       02022010 0000  CH 1066    472       11112010 0000  SU 1066    91        15112010 0000  TE 1661    216       25012011 0000  CH 1661    217       25012011 0000  CH 1661    95        01022011 0000  TE 1661    218       01022011 0000  CH 1663    97        25012011 0000  TE 1663    98        01022011 0000  TE 1663    223       01022011 0000  CH 1666    100       23012011 0000  TE 1666    225       01022011 0000  CH 1805    378       05032011 0000  CH 1805    383       05032011 0000  CH 1805    379       06032011 0000  CH 1805    381       07032011 0000  CH 2123    769       05052011 0000  SU 2123    280       10072011 0000  TE 2222    434       11052011 0000  CH 2222    513       15062011 0000  CH 4541    2285      01022013 0000  SU 4541    1688      04032014 0000  CH 4711    2300      01022012 0000  SU 4711    1257      07022012 0000  CH 4730    1262      22112012 0000  CH 4730    2303      30112012 0000  SU 6460    1699      05012014 0000  CH 6460    3201      10012014 0000  SU 6460    1698      12032014 0000  CH 6464    1701      18122013 0000  CH codepre

Negative 640 pIve been struggling with DDD for several months now and, while I think I have a reasonably good idea about some of the concepts Im less confident about how implementation should work, specifically how I should load data from the database.  It doesnt help that Ive only been working in C spottily for six months.p  p[ORIGINAL QUESTION  SEE UPDATE BELOW]p  blockquote   pIn the app Ive started working on, I have a domain namespace that contains base classes, a service namespace that performs operations using those base class, and then a repository and DAL namespace to connect to the database.  p      pI thought the easiest way to proceed would be to use inheritance in the service namespace to add procedures like LoadFromDb, but when I start implementing Im finding that this method typically requires the most code because I have to assign all the class properties twice once in the repository namespace and then in the service namespace.  p      pHeres an example.  I can get Option 2 and Option 3 to work, but I was hoping for something closer in spirit to Option 1.p blockquote  precodenamespace Domain      public class Request              public int RequestIDget set         public string RequestingUser get set         public string Title get set         public string Descriptionget set         public string status get set         namespace app      class MyApp              void Main                      option 1             Domain.Request x  new Service.svcRequest5              option 2             Domain.Request y  new Service.svcRequest5              option 3             Domain.Request z  new Domain.Request             Service.svcRequest2.loadRequest5, z                 namespace Service      public class svcRequest  Domain.Request              public svcRequestint RequestID                      this is what I want to do.

Negative 640 pI need some help or just a simple example for the following situation Obviously I have searched and googled for hours without any satisfying outcomep  pI have a lot of text comments stored in CoreData, which I want to assemble into one big html string to display them in a webview. So I have a really simple loop which iterates through all core data entries and appends the new bit onto an existing string. What I see in Instruments is that every time I do an append to string operation, a new codeCFstringcode is allocated with slightly larger size than the previous one, ending in a crash with GBs of strings allocated. at the moment Im using code[myMutableString appendFormat, myCoreDataReference]codep  pSo as I see from which corner the problem is coming from, I have tried everything I can think of as an amateur developer, obviously using NSMutable strings. Apparently Im still doing something wrong here, since the problem still remains in some form at least.p  pIf anyone can provide me with a simple example for a loop appending to a string each time with correct memory management, I would be grateful. Im using ARCp  pCheers, Bobp

Negative 640 pI have a method that accesses variables local to the class itself. Im wondering if thats a design flaw because now my unit tests are dependent on those variables being set. Is it weirdwrong to pass those variables to the method, even though that method has direct access to those variables If the method accepts those variables as parameters, then the unit test can also pass its own variables to the method.p  pFor example, here are the variables local to the classp  precodeprivate static Listltstringgt whitelistNames  GetWhitelistNamesFromConfig private static Listltstringgt blacklistNames  GetBlacklistNamesFromConfig codepre  pAnd the method looks something like thisp  precode    private static bool ThisProcessorHandlesThisFooFoo foo              if whitelistNames.Count gt 0                       Were doing this instead of Contains so we can ignore case sensitivity.             bool found  ListContainsStringwhitelistNames, foo.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase               Some logging here              return found                   if blacklistNames.Count gt 0                      bool found  ListContainsStringblacklistNames, foo.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase               Some logging              return found                   throw new InvalidOperationExceptionsome message      codepre  pIn order to do what Im suggesting, I would need to change the method signature to thisp  precodeprivate static bool ThisProcessorHandlesThisFooFoo foo, Listltstringgt whitelistNames, Listltstringgt blacklistNames codepre  pThen the calling code in the same class would have to pass the local variables to the method. This would allow my test code to send its own parameters. Am I missing something Is there a better way to do this It just seems odd to pass parameters that the method already has access to. But perhaps this is a good decoupling technique.p

Negative 640 pI am a little new to IIS and am not 100 sure that this is possible.

With this, I can create the various iterations of kwH spent over various time periods like p  ul liHourly over the last 24 hoursli liDaily over the last yearli liMinute over the last hourli ul  p.. etc. etc. p  pHere is the query p  precodeDROP table CurrentCostDataSamplesMySQLDumpLast1HourSummary  CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS CurrentCostDataSamplesMySQLDumpLast1HourSummary  messageRowID STRING, payloadsensor INT, messagetimestamp BIGINT, payloadtemp FLOAT, payloadtimestamp BIGINT, payloadtimestampmysql STRING, payloadwatt INT, payloadwattseconds INT   STORED BY org.apache.hadoop.hive.cassandra.CassandraStorageHandler WITH SERDEPROPERTIES  cassandra.host  127.0.0.1,     cassandra.port  9160,     cassandra.ks.name  EVENTKS,     cassandra.ks.username  admin,     cassandra.ks.password  admin,     cassandra.cf.name  currentcoststream,     cassandra.columns.mapping  key, payloadsensor, Timestamp, payloadtemp, payloadtimestamp, payloadtimestampmysql, payloadwatt, payloadwattseconds   select hourfromunixtimepayloadtimestamp AS hourly, sumpayloadwattseconds60601000 FROM CurrentCostDataSamplesMySQLDumpLast1HourSummary  GROUP BY hourfromunixtimepayloadtimestamp codepre  pThis query yields the following based on the sample data p  precodehourly  c1 0   16.91570472222222 1   16.363228888888887 2   15.446414166666667 3   11.151388055555556 4   18.10564666666667 5   2.2734924999999997 6   17.370668055555555 7   17.991484444444446 8   38.632728888888884 9   16.001440555555554 10  15.887023888888889 11  12.709341944444445 12  23.052629722222225 13  14.986092222222222 14  16.182284722222224 15  5.881564999999999 18  2.8149172222222223 19  17.484405 20  15.888274166666665 21  15.387210833333333 22  16.088641666666668 23  16.49990916666667 codepre  pWhich is aggregate kwH per hourly timeframe over the entire dataset.. p  pSo, now on to the next problem.  p

Negative 640 pI am trying to build a generic baud rate generator process for a uart transmitter. p  pThe transmitter works fine if I ignore the baud rate divider and pass in the clk signal in the sensitivity list. But I get errors describe in code comments if I try to implement the divider. I tried two different methods and both either gave an error, or did not have the expected output. Yes, the exact code posted will not work since I assign fbaud twice, I comment one out to test. p  pPerhaps I dont understand how the baud generator is supposed to work. From my understanding, the fpga clock runs at 50mHz which is to fast for the rs232 communication. So we need to wait a certain number of clock cycles before we can transmit our character.p  pIn this case, we have a variable baud so we divide the stock clock by the baud generator to get the number of clock cycles we need to wait before sending our tick signal to the transmit state machine.  p  pThe baud divider is set in the test bench to x000008.p  hr  precode Universal Asynch Receiver Transmitter  library ieee use ieee.stdlogic1164.all use ieee.numericstd.all  entity edsuart is    generic width  positive  16    port  clk,reset in stdlogic       dinwen in stdlogic  state machine sets value thus buffer needed      brd  in stdlogicvector23 downto 0  buad rate dividor      din  in stdlogicvector7 downto 0  input value      txd out stdlogic  sent data bit      txbusy  buffer stdlogic  sent data bit active       end entity edsuart  architecture behaviour of edsuart is     type statetype is idles, waits, transmits   three possible states of uat     signal currents statetype      signal tick stdlogic  0  baud rate clock     signal count integer  0  count number of characters sent     signal shift stdlogicvector9 downto 0  intermediate vector to be shifted     signal fbaud integer  0     signal fbaudcounter integer  0  begin     process that is causing the issue.     processclk, brd begin       fbaud lt 50000000tointegersignedbrd  50,000,000 is the default clock Hz        error message           Warning NUMERICSTD.TOINTEGER metavalue detected, returning 0         Time 0 ns  Iteration 0  Instance edsuarttbinstuart          Fatal SIGFPE Floating point exception.

Negative 640 pAs the title says, I am trying to create n children to a process. I have the following code and output. I think somewhere I allow one children to enter the loop, instead of the father, but I dont know where that happens. Or, I could think at another situation Is the father exiting before all children are created, and the orphans are adopted by another process But, if so, shouldnt that be the init process Im new to linux c, forgive me if the second scenario is wrong, but I had a similar program, where the parent was exiting, and the child did not appear to be adopted by init. It might have been something else, but Im asking in order to clarify this. Im having these doubts because I do not see where is the 1120 process created.

Negative 640 pMy very first question, because Im usually the one to answerp  pI have a projective recieved it, it is not mine from start on Symfony2. I should say that I dont consider myself a master of Symfony2 in any way.

It is me who created this piece of code and worked fine.p  pThe Problemp  pNow that I try to add more fields to table, to orm and Entity, they are not being selected by Symfony2Doctrine2 queryive looked it up in debugger and not even in query the new field is SELECTed.p  pMore so, i try to add any field and it doesnt become bound. In retrieved object it is always NULL. Ive looked up MAPPING of this entity and this field is BEING MAPPED. But in select query, again, it is not present. Ive used clear caching mechanisms and such  dindt work. Ive deleted OTHER fields from orm and entity  doctrine2 throws exceptions, though when i remove this fieldit still being present in table and works the same, just returns null.p  pWhat works is thisp  precodequeryBuilder         gtselectarraycard,card.isSpecialCard codepre  pThe isSpecialCard field is the one thats not being bound to select, so i have to customselect it out of table and THEN its loaded via select. Also, its being loaded in another level of array, NEXT TO THE OBJECT OF CARD not IN THE OBJECT, though the object still has that field AND IT HAS VALUE AS IF IT WAS SELECTED.p  pIm cracking my head over it and i dont know what to do. Project is burning with deadlines and I need help ASAP. pleasep  pP.S. Symfony 2.1yeah, i know, but what are you gonna dop

Negative 640 pI am trying to make my code much more efficient, and to remove the reliance on hard coded information. p  pSO  I want the script to check a name in a MySQL and if it exists, to update the record with that name  for instance Phill.

Negative 640 pI decided to setup lager in my Erlang project. I am using erlang.mk, so I added p  precodeERLCOPTS  parsetransform, lagertransform  codepre  pto my Makefile. I can run codemake allcode and compile the modules without errors. I can also start an codeerlcode console and run the application containing the modules using lager.

I assume the logging calls I am making are utilizing some parse transform magic in order to work and this is not present during my the Common Test runs.p  pAny suggestions are greatly appreciatedp

Negative 640 pIt seems that CMake does not support defining a relationship between the namespace of an exported or installed target and the name of the corresponding library file.p  pSo, for example, CMake makes it easy to create packages that contain unambiguously named targets such as codeMyOrgMyLibrarycode using the codeNAMESPACEcode options of the codeexportEXPORT ...code and codeinstallEXPORT ...code commands, but the actual .a, .lib, .so, or .dll files would still get globallyspaced names such as codelibMyLibrary.acode the namespace does not enter into the library filename.p  pIt is of course possible to apply namespaces to your targets yourself in the above example, you could name your target codeMyOrgMyLibrarycode, leading to a library filename such as libMyOrgMyLibrary.a. Which is ok I guess, except that this makes the codeNAMESPACEcode option essentially useless or youd end up with targets named codeMyOrgMyOrgMyLibrarycode, making me think that Im missing something.p  pIs there a way to override the name of a generated library  Or what would be the right way with CMake to ensure that library files get unambiguous names p

OMP Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linke d into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause  incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenM P runtime in any library.

As I said, the survey has around 100150 questions, so designing these in xml seems to be much tedious task. I was thinking of using database, where I would have separate tables for questions and answers. With those answers, I would maintain a flag of whether a checkboxradio button or edittext is required. And, I would use cursor loader for loading questions from the DB. But, I am not sure if this will be an overkill to the application. Or should I go for some dynamic form generation alternative.p

Negative 640 pI have 2 models, one is called Books, the other is called Users. As a relationship, a User can have exactly 1 book. I want to loop over all my users who are approved an attribute on User and sort them based on an attribute stored in Books called rating. I wrote this to do sop  precode NSArray sortedApprovedUsersByBookRating      NSArray allUsersWithBooks  [User fetchFromDatabaseWithPredicate[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatapproved  1] errornil]      NSArray sortedUsers  [allUsersWithBooks sortedArrayUsingComparatorNSComparisonResultUser a, User b          return [a.book.rating compareb.book.rating]     ]      return sortedUsers   codepre  pAnd this works because I have a relationship in core data on User called book and it grabs the right book, sorts it all fine and returns. However, I noticed that when I have a lot of users this is a very slow procedure. My theory is that its because every time I access a.book or b.book, it has to fetch it from core data.p  pI was wondering if theres a solution to this problem that when given a set of users whos approved attribute is true, that I can return those users sorted based on their book rating, where I dont have to query for the users book each time.p
Negative 640 pI made a user control that contains a text box, a button and a month view.

This particular column is for choosing the date of the transaction.  When the user clicks the small button I want the month calendar to drop down, so a date may be chosen.  p  pThe problem is that when I click the button it seems like nothing happens.  When I expand the columncell width amp height I can see the calendar and choose the date.p  pI need to know how to make the DGV cell change to the size of the entire user control once the button is clicked and then go back to normal after a date is chosen.  I would like this to happen to the cell only and not make the row height change like when I have to do it manually.p  pI need to master this because other cells will require list boxes for payees and

So it seems logical that emsomewhereem theres an event one can subscribe to, in order to be notified of new data being sent by a server. No polling, no 3rd party libraries, and no unmanaged code.

Negative 640 pIn my application I have few types of emholderem objects, which primary purpose is to store heterogeneous related data. Their lifecycles can be divided into two parts p  ol liCollecting data as soon as it becomes availableli liProviding readonly access to stored data for the rest of a holders life.li ol  pIt is very tempting to make the holders immutable, but the data is not available at one time to be passed to a constructor. The simplest workaround I see is to make two versions of a holder class, one being mutable, and another being notp  precodepublic class MutableHolder      public int field1     public String field2      ...     public Object fieldN   public class Holder      public final int field1     public final String field2      ...     public final Object fieldN      public HolderMutableHolder mutableHolder          this.field1  mutableHolder.field1         this.field2  mutableHolder.field2          ...         this.fieldN  mutableHolder.fieldN       codepre  pHowever, I feel that this approach is violating the DRY principle I must not forget to update both classes fields as well as the constructor if I want to change anything and is error prone. So here is my question are there any existing patterns that Im not aware of for implementing both mutable and immutable versions of a holder objectp  h3Edith3  pIve suddenly found out that the code above is a very barebone version of the Builder pattern see a hrefhttpcantina.coimmutableobjectsandthebuilderpattern relnofollowthisa or a hrefhttpjava.dzone.comarticlesimmutabilitywithbuilderdesignpattern relnofollowthisa. This makes me think that in this case DRY violation is considered acceptable.p

Negative 640 pIm having a problem where every 1224 hours, HHVM crashes but it seems to leave the process running. It seems most providers just use php5fpm as a failover within nginx for stability. However, this wont restart the nonresponsive hhvm instance.p  pSince the process is left running, most server monitoring solutions will see it as a live daemon, and not restart it. HTTP monitoring can be slow to react.p  pIs it possible to trigger the hhvm restart on failover If not, what would be the best solution to ensure a listening daemon thats non responsive is restarted.p

Negative 640 pWhen platform endianness is concerned, usually the choice is between little and bigendian architectures. In this simplified case, it is obvious that codehtoncode and codentohcode functions are either both noop, or both bytereverse,  i. e. they actually do absolutely the same, despite having different names.p  pHowever, there [theoretically] exist other architectures  of mixed endianness, such as PDP, with more complicated byte order rather than sequential. At first it seems that those may indeed require distinct functions for adapting data in internal format to an external format and vice versa. But when I tried to write such a pair of functions for a hypothetic PDP host, it turned out that both forward and reverse functions are identical, too, as well as for other imaginary endianness I took for example.p  pSo, am I wrong here, and there actually may exist some byte ordering scheme that requires a unique function for each direction If no such endianness exists, then which is the most proper i. e. established name for the unified function, so that its usage in source code would be intuitive and semantically correctp
Negative 640 pAsking this for a friend.p  pSuppose in my iOS project I am given a thirdparty static library .a to which I have no source code access and which is statically linked against an open source project. Im using this open source project static library as well, but with a newer version. Since its iOS they need to be all statically linked. To avoid duplicated symbol, during compilation is there an option I could give to the Clang compiler or Im personally also interested in GCC to globally mangle of this newer version of open source library maybe suppose I compile it to a static library first that I am to link top  pIn another word, to link to a .a, is there a way to name mangle the symbols during compile time, such as prepending it with a prefix, such that no symbol conflicts can occur If it cannot be done by compilers, is there a tool to name mangle it on a global scalep  pOr, any other solution to avoiding duplicated symbols are appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 640 pI would like to visualise a competition between three different processes in python. The figure should show the relative importance of each process at all grid points. My idea is to make a contourf plot with a colour map that has three extremes, for example red, green and blue. Every extreme would be assigned to one of the three processes and wherever several processes play a role we would see a mixture of the colours weighted by the relative importance of the processes. Does anyone have an idea ifhow this is possible Thank you very muchp

Negative 640 pIve been doing a lot of searching on Stack Overflow today for a solution for this and have found many questions about sorting after skipping X lines, but no really solid generic answers, so I threw together my own slipshod method of doing sop  precodehead n 15 FILE.EXT gt temp.txt tail n16 FILE.EXT  sort gtgt temp.txt mv temp.txt FILE.EXT codepre  pThis will sort the file take your pick of the options for sort, while preserving the order of the first 15 lines of it. This is obviously fairly inelegant, with three file references and two different values to enter. Ideally Id like to come up with a command that is less cumbersome, if possible, because this seems like a pretty common desire with not much support.p  ul liDoes anyone have a simpler solution than mineli liIs there anything wrong with what Ive done Potential issuesli liThis problem lends itself more strongly to using a script, but my command is still probably slightly more quick than creating and executing a script for a oneoff.li ul  pIm not even close to a bash expert, so Im hoping there is some bashfu that can make this a quick oneliner. Is there a way to create and reference variables in a single command so that a user only needs to put in something like the name and line numberp

Negative 640 pIve been struggling for awhile trying to implement my own GKMatchmaker interface no GKMatchmakerViewController. I have a separate GameKitHelper class as written in the Ray Wenderlich tutorial that implements the GKMatchDelegate and GKLocalPlayerListener. When I used the GKMatchmakerViewController, I had invites and random matchmaking working flawlessly. However, I tried to switch to my own view controller that fired, with the click of a button, a findMatchWithminPlayers.... as shown below that created a shared GKMatchmaker to perform findMatchForRequest... withCompletionHandler.... I have a couple printlns testing for certain values but every time the match.expectedPlayerCount never reaches 0, just stays at 1. This means the if matchStarted  false and match.expectedPlayersCount  0 is never satisfied and the lookupPlayers method never calledmatch cant be started.

Negative 640 pI have a Singleton application server assume being created correctly. The server class has a non static vector member which is modified in several methods. Is it possible that the compiler optimizes the code such that the vector is modified non serially across several request processing method chains. I mean can two chains of method calls may intersect across different requests  I think they can because the method calls would be jumps to labels .p

Negative 640 pI have complex application that does image processing using the AForge framework. Now, I need to improve performances. Basic idea is the followingp  pA moving camera takes hundreds of pictures. Those pictures are stitched using the emgu.cv framework following a logic final result gives 35 stitched pictures. This works perfectly.p  pOnce an image file is created, there is an separate application with a FileWatcher, who see the file and launchs an image processing function using the AForge framework. Result of this processing is sent to the master program.p  pNow, the images are stitched relatively rapidly. The bottleneck in our system is the image processing function.p  pIn the FileWatcher, there is a parallel.Invoke that calls a subroutine. This subroutine creates a new instance of the class in C in which the AForge librairies is encapsulated and calls the functions. Result is sent to the master from there.p  pParallel.Invoke is synchronous. To process the 35 stitched images in sequence, it takes about 1min40. Each calls of the subroutine takes about 3 seconds. This is the best result I got so far.p  pI tried to launch more than one subroutine at once, using BackgroundWorker, Task.Factory.StartNew, ThreadPool, Thread, BeginInvoke... But the end result is WAY longer, about a minute more. Each thread is created as a stitched image becomes available, but the result can take 1min to appear it takes 3 seconds when done synchronously..p  pComputer is very powerfull. Server board, 2 physical CPUs, 24 cores, 16 gig ram. When everything is working together, no core ever goes above 60 usage.p  pI know its a long shot, but does anyone would have an idea how I could improve performancep  pthanks a lot for your time and helpp

Negative 640 pI have been using HLM software to run multilevel models, but now I am moving to R so I can get my jobs done faster. I have not been able to get equivalent results when I use weights though I get almost identical results when I do not weight.p  pIn the lme4 package in R, I am using the codelmercode function to run a 2 level model. I have weights that need to be applied at level1, but I cant figure out how to do this. I can use the codeweights code option in the codelmercode function, but I think this weights the level1 and level2 variables. In HLM, there is a specific option under level1 to include weights. p  pI have tried to apply the weights ahead of time by multiplying all my level1 variables by the weights. For some reason, when I do this, my results are different from both the HLM results and the weighted R results.p  pAny ideas Does anyone know how the weighting option works in the lmer function or how the weighting works in HLM Thanksp

Negative 640 pI am trying to create a program where you select one of the four numbers, each giving a different result besides 2 of them. Selecting 10 will square it, making the answer 100.

Negative 640 pIm fairly new to Python, and am creating a program that tracks RFID badges used by the students in my school district.  In my program I have a class named codeBadgecode that creates a badge object with six public named variables RFID, studentID, status, dateActivated, dateDeactivated, reason.  I then have a class named codeBadgeTablecode that holds badges.p  pWhat I want to do is see if a specific RFID or studentID exists in any of the badges.  I know I can do this with loops, but that can take a while Im reading in about 450 CSV files, each of which contains 2000 to 14000 badges, and adding a badge to BadgeTable only if it hasnt already been added.  p  blockquote   pEdit to expand on the above, all badge data for the last three years has been manually entered into a spreadsheet that has logic to identify duplicate RFID or studentID numbers, then exported each day as a CSV file for the badge reader software.  For the first year of our bus badge program each days CSV file only contained active badges we naively assumed that if we stopped sending inactive badges they would be rejected by the badge reader.  When we discovered we were wrong, we started including the inactive badges we knew about in the CSV files we added a suffix to the studentID for each inactive badge to keep them unique, so from then on each dayss CSV file was a superset of the previous days file.  However, there are a not insignificant number inactivelost badges not in the current CSV file, so the above process was meant to be a way use the old CSV files to a get as complete a list as possible of badges weve issued, and b eliminate misspellings in the student names associated with each badge.p blockquote  pId like to be able to say something likep  precodestudentBadges  BadgeTable    Bunch of code to load badges into studentBadges   if RFID not in studentBadges[].RFID     studentBadges.addbadgeRFID, studentID, A, fileDate, None, None codepre  pWhat I want that to do is see if the variable RFID matches the RFID field in any of the badges in studentBadges.  Ive tried that, and codestudentBadges[][1]code, but both fail both with codeBadgeTable object is not subscriptablecodep  pMy current workaround is to actually store a separate list in the BadgeTable class named codeRFIDListcode, and when each badge gets added to codeBadgeTablecode I also add its RFID value to codeRFIDListcode.  As long as I never sort either codeRFIDListcode or the list of badges itself I can do things likep  precodedef deletebadgeself, RFID     Delete an individual badge from BadgeTable      if RFID in self.RFIDList         idx  self.RFIDList.indexRFID         del self.RFIDList[idx]         del self.BadgeTable[idx] codepre  pIs there a more elegant, more Pythonic way to test for the existence of a value in a compound object in Python 3, one that doesnt involve keeping parallel lists in the classp

Negative 640 pI am creating a mapreduce framework, and right now I am trying to create a builder class to instantiate the processing pipeline.

Negative 640 pI know guys, there are tons of questions about the codeAmazon S3code Buckets and codeCORScode. But please, let me add mine.p  pSo Im writing an application in codeDartcode and I am performing an ajax request to a resource which is hosted on S3. I originally wanted to grab the first 100 bytes of the resource which is why I came up with the following beautiful piece of codep  precode   HttpRequest req  new HttpRequest    req.openGET, item.getupload.geturl    req.setRequestHeaderRange, bytes099    req.onReadyStateChange.wheree gt req.readyState  HttpRequest.DONE.first.thene        printreq.responseText        req.send codepre  pAs you may guess from the title of this question, this code didnt work and I get a p  blockquote   pNo AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource. Origin a hrefhttplocalhost8080 relnofollowhttplocalhost8080a is therefore not allowed access.p blockquote  pThis seemed pretty strange to me, since I set up a codeCORScode which should prevent this issue...p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltCORSConfiguration xmlnshttps3.amazonaws.comdoc20060301gt     ltCORSRulegt         ltAllowedOrigingtltAllowedOrigingt         ltAllowedHeadergtltAllowedHeadergt         ltAllowedMethodgtGETltAllowedMethodgt         ltAllowedMethodgtPUTltAllowedMethodgt         ltAllowedMethodgtPOSTltAllowedMethodgt     ltCORSRulegt ltCORSConfigurationgt codepre  pFor whatever reasons this obviously doesnt work. I loaded the application in Firefox and voila, its working. It seems like codeCORScode does work and the issue is either because of codeChromecode or codeDartcode.p  pI fiddled around a little bit and for some reasons, you may excuse me, its pretty late here, I came up with thisp  precode   HttpRequest req  new HttpRequest    req.openGET, item.getupload.geturl    req.setRequestHeaderRange, 099    req.onReadyStateChange.wheree gt req.readyState  HttpRequest.DONE.first.thene        printreq.responseText        req.send codepre  pYea exactly, I just removed codebytescode from my previous code snipped. And guess what, suddenly my ajax requests runs through and prints the full text. Wooot I can add a corrupted codeRange Headercode and I get over this security issue Well, thats exactly what just happend. Of course, I got more than the first 100 bytes, but at least I got something. Since I had no explaination why a corrupted codeRangecode header make the request work, I replaced the codeRangecode header with some other random strings and none of them worked.p  pI know, your mind probably just got blown  so did mine Thus I want to summarize what we just discovered.p  ul liMaking a CrossDomain ajax request in Chrome with Dart doesnt work due to security issues, althoughli lithe CORS which is setup seems to work at least for Firefox.li liChromes security issue can be exploited by adding a corrupted codeRangecode request header, butli lino other header has the same effect.li ul  pLike really I mean, I have no idea whats going on here.  Can anyone explain at least something to me  and in case someone has an idea or solution to address the issue that I cannot get the first 100 bytes in Chrome, I would be thankful for the rest of my life.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 640 pIve heard of this tactic to improve cell loading performance quite a few times, and its mentioned as a technique in a hrefhttpblog.jaredsinclair.compost81410534498cellheightcachingdilemmasinunread relnofollowthis blog post by Jared Sinclaira, but how would I go about doing thisp  pTo my knowledge the table view if you dont supply an estimated row height asks for the height of every cell in the table view as soon as it has a data source. Therefore, at what point would I be able to do precalculations In my head that would mean supplying a handful at the beginning to allow the table view to have a foundation, then calculate the rest on a background thread. But this doesnt seem possible, as the table view asks for emallem the cell heights.p  pIn Jared Sinclairs post he also mentions that he does this eminsteadem of estimated row height, so I dont think that would have anything to do with the solution.p  pSo how do I leverage background threads to improve cell height loading From what I can tell my app has a several second delay when about to display around 100 variableheight cells, and Id like to improve this.p

Both codeSetDatacode calls are strongallowedstrong to be done simultaneously. They do not interfere with each other, only with the critical section.  Generally speaking accessing one codeAPIObjectcode from multiple threads is strongnotstrong threadsafe but accessing multiple codeAPIObjectscode does not interfere with the API except during critical section. The critical section must never be executed while any codeAPIObjectcode Method is used. Guarding access to one codeAPIObjectcode from multiple threads is not required.p  hr  pstrongThe trivial approachstrongp  pUse a lock Object and codelockcode the critical section and every call to API Objects.p  pThis would effectively work but creates many unnecessary locks because of the fact that then also only one codeAPIObjectcode at a time could be accessed too.p  hr  pstrongConcurrent container of Actionsstrongp  pUse a single instance of a concurrent container where each modification of an codeAPIObjectcode is placed into a thread safe container and is executed in the task above explicitly by traversing the container outside the critical section and calling all actions. Not a Consumer pattern, as waiting for new entries of the container must not block the task since the critical section must be executed periodicallyp  pThis imposes some drawbacks. Closure issues when capturing contexts could be one. Another would be reading from an codeAPIObjectcode returns old data as long as the actions in the container are not executed. Even worse if the creation of an codeAPIObjectcode is put in the container and subsequent code assumes it has already be created.p  hr  pstrongMake something up with Wait Handles and atomic incrementsstrongp  pEvery codeAPIObjectcode access could be guarded with a codeManualResetEventcode. The critical section would wait for the signal to be set by the codeAPIObjectscode, the signal would only be set when all calls to codeAPIObjectscode have finished some sort of atomic incrementsdecrement around accessing codeAPIObjectscode.p  pSounds like a great way for deadlocks. May lock out the critical section for long periods of time when continuous codeAPIObjectcode calls prevent the signal from being ever set.p  pDoes not solve the problem that codeAPIObjectscode may not be accessed during critical section since this construct only guards in the other direction. Requires additional locking e.g codeMonitor.IsEnteredcode on the critical section to not lock out simultaneous calls to distinct codeAPIObjectscode.p  p Awful way, making a complex situation even more complexp

Id rather have it in the form of codeanswer A, value 21code but the owner wants tuples.p  pI am trying to create the class in Java to make GSON create the above to send over POST to the API, but my understanding of this process is that GSON names the key based on the variable name. This is fine for the codeusercode, codepasscode and codeitemIDcode but for the items within the codelistSelectioncode where the key is dynamic, this does not work. Im not sure if I need to put it in a map, or if theres another way in GSON for dynamically setting the key.p  pI was thinking something like thisp  precodepublic class AnswerSet       private String user     private String pass     private int itemID     private ListltAnswergt listSelection  codepre  pwhere the codeAnswercode class might bep  precodepublic class Answer       private String answer     private long answerValue  codepre  pBut this will format the codeJSONcode incorrectly.p  pCan anyone help Thanks.p

Negative 640 pThe scenariop  pI have a local DB and a remote public DB. Both are synced using SQLyog SJA job files  which sync both DBs to be the same. It works well. p  pThe part of the DB with the issue is a user comments table. p  pThe local DB contains thousands of user comments, and more are always being added through various means. These are all synced to the remote DB comments table. p  pThe remote comments table DB accepts direct user comments to be entered. These then sync to the local comments DB. p  pIt is a two way sync, where neither one deletes from the other. This actually seems to work well and is automated through SJA. p  pThe problemp  pThe primary key IDs for the comments are auto incremented on both sides. p  pSo if both tables are in exact sync and the key count is at 50, and a user makes a remote entry it will be key 51. Now the local DB is also growing and a different entry is made under key 51. So when the next sync is called there will be a problem as the keys are conflicting. p  pPossible solutionsp  pSo I thought A good idea would be to add a large number to the remote comments PK ID as they are added. That way when a sync is called the primary keys will not conflict as the local PK ID would never get that high. p  pIt worked well on the first sync. But the problem is that the auto increment feature will increment off the highest value, even if there is a large gap in between the keys. So this solution does not work.  p  pI would like to maintain a single table for user comments and have a seamless sync but the issue of conflicting primary keys is a problem. p  pI am interested if other people have some thoughts on the matter. p  pI hope I described the problem clearly. p  pThanks.p  p EDIT p  pI have found a solution that works. p  pI changed the primary key ID to just a normal INT with auto increment. I then created a second ID INT field which consists of a random INT about 10 in length. I now use the two ID fields together to form a PK ID. Now the chance of a conflict between the two DBs is essentially none existent. The auto incremented ID and the long random INT ID would both have to be the same on the same entry, highly unlikely with the volume Im dealing with. p  pNot the best solution but it works well. p  pHope this helps someone else out. p

Negative 640 pIm looking to serialize a class that contains stdstring to file and easily load this data in Pythonp  precodeclass A    public     int a     char b     bool c     stdstring s1     stdstring s2  codepre  pI have a very busy thread that deals with many instances of A.

Would the logging thread be able to cast the saveda.data to a type A and then read the strings Or does the memcpy only save pointers to strings that may no longer be valid.p  pCopying the A structure isnt really possible because createBlob can take many different data structures only requires a void  and a size. Im willing to sacrifice platform independence and count outtest through the packing to make sure that the Python parser works, but really need to minimize the load put on the function that creates blobs and need to ensure that it can create blobs of many different data types. p  pIf the stdstring would remain valid when the low priority logger gets to them, he could recast the data and a do a full copy. Otherwise, is there a lightweight solution to serialize the structure before passing to createBlob function comparable in performance to doing the memcpyp

Negative 640 pI am currently modernizing my toycompiler code to use as many C11 features as possible to learn how to write modern C. While looking at my code, searching for things to modernise I found this constructp  precodefor sizet i  0 i lt vector.size i     for sizet j  0 j lt vector[i].length j  codepre  pvector is a codestdvectorltstdstringgtcode containing the source code of the file which needs to be compiled. Each codestdstringcode in the vector is a line of code which needs to be compiled. Before compilation takes place the compiler checks whether the code to be compiled has any syntax errors, and the first step of this check is to look out for missing semicolons. I do this by looking at each character one by one and checking if said character is a semicolon. If it is, I perform a check whether the semicolon is needed by building a kind of minisyntaxtree and thereby determining if it is necessary. I currently access each character with codevector[i][j]code which is very reminiscent of ANSIC this is how you access each character in an array of char and I want to replace this with iterators. As far as I know, an Iterator is a pointerlike construct which points to an element in a containersequencewhatever. Applying the pointer analogy I deduced that an codestdvectorltstdstringgtiteratorcode points to a string in a vector, therefore a theoretical codestdvectorltstdstringgtiteratoriteratorcode would point to a single character in a string object. But because there isnt such thing in the STL the pointer analogy isnt of much use here. So my question is How do I access each Character within a codestdvectorltstdstringgtiteratorcode  p

Negative 640 pI created an application that uses an input, of type numberp  precodeltinput typenumber min1000000 max1000000 step0.01gt codepre  pIn IE, this has a little clear or [X] on the right side. My users find this very valuable because they enter large numbers in these fields, and often like to clear them out with a click.p  pIt turns out that some of the users prefer Chrome as their browser. In Chrome, however, this text box shows a spinner, which is an updown arrow. This is of no use here because they arent going to increment these large numbers by 1 cent to reach a target. p  pI was able to search and find info on how to hide the spinner in chrome, and I also saw that a search input box might give me the [X] I was looking for, but at the cost of losing the built in support for number type.p  pI wasnt able to find any way to specify an [X]Clear in Chrome number INPUT fields.p  pThe only option I can think of is hiding the spinner using CSS I think this can be done, and adding my own button to the right instead, using JS to clear out the textbox. Before I do this, wondering if there was a trick I missed.p  pThe other option, which seems less appealing, would be to convert my text boxes to type search, and then add all of the manual number checking JS logic by hand.p  pThanksp
