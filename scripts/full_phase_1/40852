Positive 40852 pMy DataFlow pipeline starts with a codeBatchBlockcode. I would like to trigger the codeBatchBlockcode with the help of the codeTriggerBatchcode method. My batch sizes can be variable, so when creating the codeBatchblockcode I have placed a rather high codeBatchSizecode which I dont really expect to be reached.p  pNow I would like to call the codeTriggerBatchcode method depending on the fact that whether the codeBatchBlockcode indeed has some elements in it which could infact be triggered into a batch. Is there a way to check whether the internal buffer of the codeBatchblockcode is nonempty If not, could someone please suggest a solution for the same to me. The codeBatchBlockcode is being fed from multiple threads which codePostcode data into the codeBatchblockcode. However I would like a mechanism which could wait until there are elements present in the codeBatchblockcode before triggering it. Basically I would not want my codeTriggerBatchcode to be fruitless. Unfortunately, using a timer is not an option for me.p  pAt this point I do need a third persons opinion as I have been stuck on this for quite a while now.p

If I force the max degree of parall then its hit that max number and stays there. p  pSetting the maxdegree feels wrong.p  pIt currently is doing about 1020 inserts a second. This is also in a simple Console App  so theres emnoem other database activity besides whats happening in my codeParallel.ForEachcode loop.p  pIs using codeParallel.ForEachcode the incorrect thing in this case because this is notCPU bound p  pShould I be using codeasyncawaitcode  If so, what stopping this from doing hundreds of db calls in one gop  pSample code which is basically what Im doing.p  precodevar items  GetItemsFromSomewhere  Returns 37K items.  Parallel.ForEachitems gt item      using var sqlConnection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString              var result  sqlConnection.ExecutemyQuery, new  ...         codepre  pMy incorrect understanding of this was that there should on be about 8 or so connections at any time to the db. The Connection Pool will release the connection which remains instantiated in the Connection Pool, waiting to be used. And if the codeExecutecode takes .. i donno .. lets say even a 1 second the longest running time for an insert was about 500ms .. and thats 1 in every 100 or so ... thats ok .. that thread is blocked and chills until the codeExecutecode completes. Then the scope completes and codeDisposecode is auto called and the connection closed. With the connection closed, the codeParallel.ForEachcode then grabs the next item in the collection, goes to the connection pool and then grabs a spare connection remember  we just closed one, a split second ago ... rinse.repeat.p  pIs this wrongp  pNotesp  ul li.NET 4.5li liSql 2012li liConsole app.li liUsing Dapper.NET for sql code.li ul

Positive 40852 pI am exploring neo4j for a large scale optimization application. Basically, I have uploaded a graph of locations to neo4j DB. The use case is to find the shortest path between two nodes. I am able to do this using neo4jclient, however, I have to find the shortest paths between several nodes for each request and I was looking to use Task Parallel Library c, .net  to send cypher queries to neo4j for different pairs of locations inparallel and then add up all the distances. I dont see an async method in the GraphClient interface in Neo4jClient. Has anyone implemented this kind of parallel cypher queries in .net or is it just not reasonable to expect this kind of parallelism with cypherp
Positive 40852 pI have to write a program where Im reading from a database the queues to process and all the queues are run in parallel and managed on the parent thread using a ConcurrentDictionary.

Positive 40852 pI am getting my hands dirty with TPL.I stumbled upon a topic in TPL called TaskCompletionSource which is one of the ways to create a Task and it give you more control over the task by allowing developers in setting result,exception etc etc. Here is an example using task completion sourcep  precode   public static Taskltintgt RunAsyncFunctionFuncltintgt sampleFunction              if sampleFunction  null             throw new NullReferenceExceptionMethod cannot be null          var tcs  new TaskCompletionSourceltintgt          ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem gt                      try                              int result  sampleFunction                 tcs.SetResultresult                          catch Exception ex                              tcs.SetExceptionex                                return tcs.Task      codepre  pHowever this is not truly asynchronus programming.It is asynchronus programming using multithreading .How can I convert this example to get it run on a single thread rather than multiple threads  or is there any other example I can followp

Action usefulWork   gt                      try                              Thread.SleeptaskAwait                 cancellationSource.Cancel                          catch                    Action progressUpdate   gt                      int i  0             while i lt 10                              UpdateUI gt  button2.Text  Processing   i.ToString                  Thread.SleepprogressRefresh                 i                          cancellationSource.Cancel                   var usefulWorkTask  new TaskusefulWork, cancellationSource.Token         var progressUpdateTask  new TaskprogressUpdate, cancellationSource.Token          try                      cancellationSource.Token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested             Task tWork  Task.Factory.StartNewusefulWork, cancellationSource.Token             Task tProgress  Task.Factory.StartNewprogressUpdate, cancellationSource.Token             await Task.Run gt                              try                                      var res  Task.WaitAnynew[]  tWork, tProgress , cancellationSource.Token                                                          catch               .ConfigureAwaitfalse                  catch Exception ex                           await Task.Run gt  UpdateUI gt  button2.Text  button2        codepre  pBasically, the idea is to run two parallel tasks  one is for, say, progress bar or whatever update and a sort of timeout controller, the other is the long running task itself. Whichever task finishes first cancels the other one. So, there should not be a problem to cancel the progress task as it has a loop in which I can check if task is marked cancelled. The problem is with the long running one. It could be Thread.Sleep or SqlConnection.Open. When I run CancellationSource.Cancel, the long running task keeps working and does not cancel. After a timeout I am not interested in long running task or whatever it may result in.br As the cluttered code example may suggest, I have tried a bunch of variants and none given me a desired effect. Something like Task.WaitAny freezes UI... Is there a way to make that cancellation work or may be even a different approach to code these thingsp  pstrongUPDstrong    p  precodepublic static class Taskhelpers      public static async TaskltTgt WithCancellationltTgtthis TaskltTgt task, CancellationToken cancellationToken              var tcs  new TaskCompletionSourceltboolgt         using cancellationToken.Registers gt TaskCompletionSourceltboolgts.TrySetResulttrue, tcs                      if task  await Task.WhenAnytask, tcs.Task                 throw new OperationCanceledExceptioncancellationToken                  return await task          public static async Task WithCancellationthis Task task, CancellationToken cancellationToken              var tcs  new TaskCompletionSourceltboolgt         using cancellationToken.Registers gt TaskCompletionSourceltboolgts.TrySetResulttrue, tcs                      if task  await Task.WhenAnytask, tcs.Task                 throw new OperationCanceledExceptioncancellationToken                  await task       codepre  p.....p  precode        var taskAwait  4000         var progressRefresh  200         var cancellationSource  new System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource         var cancellationToken  cancellationSource.Token          var usefulWorkTask  Task.Runasync  gt                      try                              System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLineWORK  started                  await Task.DelaytaskAwait.WithCancellationcancellationToken                  System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLineWORK  finished                          catch OperationCanceledException     just drop out if got cancelled             catch Exception ex                              System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLineWORK  unexpected error    ex.Message                      , cancellationToken          var progressUpdatetask  Task.Runasync  gt                      for var i  0 i lt 25 i                              if cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested                                      System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine    i.ToString                     await Task.DelayprogressRefresh                                       ,cancellationToken          await Task.WhenAnyusefulWorkTask, progressUpdatetask          cancellationSource.Cancel codepre  pBy modifying codefor var i  0 i lt 25 icode limit of codeicode I imitate whether long running task finishes before the progress task or otherwise.

Positive 40852 pWe have a processor that will receive a queue of elements, and for every element, it will run some actions that need to be guaranteed to be executed in a sequential manner. Each action to execute on an element is a Promise Task a hrefhttpblog.stephencleary.com201404atouroftaskpart0overview.html relnofollowhttpblog.stephencleary.com201404atouroftaskpart0overview.htmla. The processing of each element in the queue doesnt need to wait for completion of the previous one. The signature of the actions can be assumed to be something like thisp  precodeTask MyAwaitableMethodint delay codepre  pThe way Im seeing, the problem can be reduced to executing a loop, and inside the loop, executing sequential operations, and each iteration shouldnt block. Im looking at 2 approaches 1. p  precodefor var i  0 i lt Iterations i      Task.Runasync  gt              await MyAwaitableMethodDelayInMilliseconds             await MyAwaitableMethodDelayInMilliseconds       codepre  p2.p  precodefor var i  0 i lt Iterations i      MyAwaitableMethodDelayInMilliseconds.ContinueWith         antecedent gt MyAwaitableMethodDelayInMilliseconds  codepre  pI was assuming, given the actions are Promises, that with approach 2, there would be less threads created, as opposed to Task.Run, which Id assume would create more threads. But in tests Ive run, the number of threads created for both when executing a high number of iterations tends to be the same, and not dependent of the given number of iterations.p  pAre both methods entirely equivalent Or you guys have better suggestionsp  pEDIT rephrasing the question Are both methods equivalent in terms of the number of threads both requirep  pThanksp
Positive 40852 pI need to write a service with some complex behaviour like simultanious tasks and Im facing an issue with.p  pIve written a sample in xUnit to show you the problem.p  p1 want to execute a task on a background, eventually start some child tasks.

In my task, Im having a loop that say, as long as its not a cancellation request delay if for 10 second.p  pSo the behaviour I expect would bep  ul liStart the application.li liStart the task since its no cancellation request, a delay of 10 seconds will start.li liWait for 3 seconds and then cancel the token.li liWait for the task with the 10 second delay to complete and then exit.li ul  pWhy doesnt my code wait for the 10 seconds frame to passp

During each process, I am logging 61,000 lines that are about 60 characters long.p  pI have researched that it is better to use .AppendText than to say codetextBox.Text  newTextcode as this resets the entire TextBoxs text. I am looking for a solution that may include a faster way to print to a TB or a UI element better suited for quick logging or if using codeString.JoinEnvironment.NewLine, itemcode is inefficient and could be sped up in any way.p
Positive 40852 pI have a WPF application that communicate with the server via WCF. I execute a method on the remote server and the callback method initializes a list with the results which running on a different thread.

Positive 40852 pI read some posts here on TPL but need some clarification. I have a long running process that sits and waits for the client connections.

Here is an example of what I am trying.p  precodeprivate CancellationTokenSource cts  new CancellationTokenSource           public void SomeMethod    var task  new Taskgt MethodActs, cts.Token, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning   task.Start   task.Wait   public void MethodA     cts.Token.Register gt             SomeObj.Stop          SomeObj.Start   public void EndTheLongProcess      cts.Cancel     cts.Dispose  codepre  pWhen the token is canceled, the anonymous callback method inside MethodA calls the stop on the long running process. If I dont call the cancel, this process will run forever. Am I approaching this right   p  pI see a lot of examples here showing just codetask.Waitcode without codects.Cancelcode.  Does codetask.Waitcode wait for the task to finish and then invoke the codects.Cancelcode and codects.Disposecode behind the scene p  pLooks like I need a trycatch if I use the codetask.Waitcodep  precodetry   task.Wait  CatchException ex    Log.InfoTask Cancelled before completion...  codepre  pIs the main thread blocked at codetask.Waitcode or do I need codetask.Waitcode at allp
Positive 40852 pFollowup to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq3254286162600this questiona. I have a library with many async methods that thinly wrap a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.http.httpclient.aspx relnofollowcodeHttpClientcodea. Effectively they just do some setup and directly return the codeTaskcode returned from the codeHttpClientcode callp  precodepublic Task DoThingAsyc       do some setup     return httpClient.DoThingAsync  codepre  pIm pondering whether to add codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode to these calls. The prevailing wisdom seems to be yes, always do that in libraries.

Certainly not hard to codep  precodepublic async Task DoThingAsyc       do some setup     return await httpClient.DoThingAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalse  codepre  pMy question is, will the efficiency benefits of codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode likely outweigh the extra overhead introduced in this case What example above would be considered the better practicep
Positive 40852 pstrongOverviewstrongp  pI have been working for quite some time trying to find a post that addresses my particular situation, but have come up empty. I am attempting to create a C .NET console application that will parse an XML file with multiple database restore definitions, and then subsequently launch those restores in parallel using SQL Management Objects. After each restore, the user may specify zero to many SQL files that they would wish to run against the newly restored database. Whenever I attempt more than 4 of these jobs in parallel, the static method handling the execution of SQL files against the database chokes on calling the ExecuteNonQuery method against the locally created ServerConnection.

IListltEntityCgt CList     codepre  pI have to fetch all the colelctions Blist in EntityA and CList in EntityB, because if they all will be needed to make some operations, if i dont eager load them i will have the select n1 problem. So the query was thisp  precode  select a from EntityA a left join fetch a.BList b left join fetch b.CList c codepre  pThe fist problem i faced with this query, was the return of duplicates from the DB, i had EntityA duplicates, because of the left join fetch with BList.  A quick read through the hibernate documentation and there were some solutions, first i tried the distinct keyword that supposelly wouldnt replicate the SQL distinct keyword except in some cases, maybe this was one of those cases because i had a SQL error saying that i cannot select distict text columns column [Observations] in EntityA table. So i used one of the other solutionsp  precode  query.SetResultTransformernew DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer codepre  pThis worked fine. But the result of the operations were still not passing the tests. I checked further and i found out that now there were duplicates of EntityB, because of the left join fetch with CList. p  pThe question is, how  can i use the distinct in a second level collection I searched and i only find solutions for the root entitys direct child collection, but never for the second level child collections...p  pThank you for your timep

Negative 40852 pI have what should be a simple requirement, however, I am keen to get an opinion on the best solution.p  pFirstly, I am using CakePHP and JQuery on a LAMP dev server.p  pThe site uses a simple search form that submits data via GET to searchtermxxxp  pThe search logic implements a number of time consuming calls to multiple third party APIs, currently up to 5 secs.p  pWhat I need is the page to load as quickly possible and then provide the end user with responsive feedback. I think implementing a  to display a please wait message or animated gif would be the best approach. On page load  search submission, an Ajax call is performed to a cakePHP URL that kicks off the intensive queries, passing the search term, and responds an array of data for layout.p  pIt should work similar to car insurance comparison sites, aggregating data from multiple sources and providing the end user with responsive feedback.p  pDoes this sound correct Can anyone provide any code examples  URLs to solidify my understandingp  pThanks, Paulp

Negative 40852 pIve been thinking about creating a Java framework that would allow programmers to specify invariants pre and postconditions on interfaces.

E.G. p  precodeinterface Sort      int [] sortint [] nums  codepre  pwould be decorated with an annotation to ensure that any implementations return a sorted list.

Negative 40852 pIm trying to get a better handle on how threads work in ASP.NET, so I have a test site with a few pages, and I have a test WinForms client that creates 40 roughly concurrent requests to the test site. The requests take about 510 seconds to completethey call a web service on another server. When I run the test client, I can use Fiddler to see that the requests are being made concurrently. However, when I look at Performance Monitor on the web server, with counters ASP.NET Apps v2.0.xxxRequests Executing, ASP.NETRequests Current, ASP.NET Requests Queued, these counters never display more than 2. This is the case regardless of whether the test page Im requesting is set up with AsyncTrue and using the BeginEnd pattern of calling the web service, or if its set up to make the call synchronously. Judging by what I see in Fiddler, I would think I should be seeing a total of 40 requests in one of those states, but I dont. Why is that Do these counters not mean what I think they meanp
Negative 40852 pOk, so Ive got this Visual Studio 2008 Project I was working with about a year ago perhaps.  And this project had a datagrid that was linked to an external database running on a server off the internet. Now, this databinding was all done using Visual Studio 2008s built in features. But how can I now change the binding to a different server, without destroying the project Ive noticed that a lot of the code that Visual Studio creates makes a mess. So manually trying to change the datasource has allways fcked up the whole project for me.p  pIm not all that good with this stuff, thats why I used the built in features of Visual Studio. But I noticed that several things appear, like a binding source, and a dataset.  Is it possible to do this Perhaps even better, making these settings be controlled after the program has been compiled. The way it is now, its all hard coded after compiling, and that kinda sucks. I remember trying to do this about a year ago, trying to bind these settings to variables stored in settings. But I never got that to work. Just throwing around ideas here p  pAny help, pointers or whatever is highly appreciated p
Negative 40852 pI have to do a proof of concept and thus far Im finding primarily old articles that reference IIS6 which isnt helping.p  pIn short I have the following requirements.p  pI need to secure one filepage and this one filepage only using a client certificate. The rest of the site does need to continue operating under SSL but doesnt require client certificate, just this one file. User mapping is forbidden as mapping will be done programatically via CVB.NET.p  pNow I know this shouldnt be hard. I mean I should have access to the Request.ClientCertificate property but my problem is that in my testing I cant get a client certificate to travelling along the wire.p  pIve set IIS on one folder  just to make my life simple  require SSL and accept client certs as well as require client certs but all i get from iis once visiting the page is codeHTTP1.1 403 Forbiddencode. I never get asked to choose a client certificate to send to the server it just spews all over my request and drops it. p  pIt gets even weirder when Im using some code to test this. In this client code the CertPolicy class just returns true from a method to ignore cert errors and test.cer is a self signed cert made from using MakeCert. Just to make it clear though, only the client cert if self signed, the main cert is properly signed, but i play with fiddler alot and I havent trusted that cert so thats why I have the hacky callback.p  precodeDim Cert As X509Certificate  X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFileCerttest.cer  Handle any certificate errors on the certificate from the server.

Now I have to push for every change I want to see in browser.p

That makes any sqlite3preparev2 fail, because the tables arent there.  If I manually copy the projectfusion.db3 file to that directory before running, then it works just fine.p  pIs it because Im doing this inside the unit tests and the scripts dont have permission or something  Or is it possibly because Im working on a school computer at my university and cant write to that directory I tried logging in as admin and it didnt work either.p

Negative 40852 pI have pretty much already decided not to use asynchronous, nonblocking Java NIO. The complexity versus benefit is very questionable in general, and I think its not worth it in this project particularly.p  pBut most of what I read about NIO, and comparisons with older java.io. focuses on nonblocking, asynchronous NIO versus threadperconnection synchronous IO using java.io.. However, NIO can be used in synchronous, blocking, threadperconnection mode, which is rarely discussed it seems.p  pHeres the question Is there any performance advantage of synchronous, blocking NIO versus traditional synchronous, blocking IO java.io. Both would be threadperconnection. How does the complexity comparep  pNote that this is a general question, but at the moment I am primarily concerned with TCP socket communication.p

Negative 40852 pI have a question about spring and struts. Currently I have spring injecting my struts action classes for me.p  pI was experimenting and trying to get Spring to inject my Struts action classes for me using autowiring.p  pI have my spring codeapplicationContextcode config file scanning the base package that the  action class is in using codecontextcomponentscan basepackagemy.packagecode,  and im using codeComponentcode annotation at the action classes class level. Im also using codeQualifiermyActionClasscode at the same action classes class level. Im not configuring the action class as a Spring bean in codeapplicationContextcode.p  pThen in my codestruts.xmlcode config file, while configuring my action class, instead of giving the fully qualified package and class name, I use the codeQualifiercode annotation name codemyActionClasscode.p  pThis doesnt work though. If in my codeapplicationContextcode config file, configure my action class as a spring bean, get rid of the codeComponentcode and codeQualifiercode annotation on the action class, and in struts.xml,  put the action classes Spring bean id for the class, then Spring injects my action class for me and everything is dandy. Only, this isnt using Autowiring the action class, and thats what I was testing.p  pAnyone know if autowiring using contextcomponentscan basepackage  to scan your packages for your action classes so you dont have to configure them in codeapplicationContextcode is possiblep

Negative 40852 pSo I was asked to look at reconstructing a section of a website which I didnt build. One of the issues Im running into is a contact form which is being loaded through an iFrame from another server. Obviously, the forms action submits to the other server, and the information is stored in a database for the client to see later.p  pIve never had to deal with something like this before and Im wondering if I need to go through some sort of API the host may be able to provide, or can I recreate the form so I can style it and just have it submit to the same server. Sorry for the noob level of this question, but Im just looking to be pointed in the right direction.p

Sometimes can be as much as 35 seconds  for example, when theres a datagrid with 100 rows. But when you go to another tab, and then go back to that same screen, it opens fast as long as its viewmodel stays put.p  pThis is very annoying not just because its slow, but because I cant do anything about it. If I had some control over the slowness, I could, maybe, display some emopening, please waitem message or something...p  pBesides, when I look at some other WPF applications most notably, ILSpy, they seem to work reasonably fast, despite the large amounts of data.

Negative 40852 h2Backgroundh2  pMy application gathers data from the phone and sends the to a remote server.br The data is first stored in memory or on file when its big enough and every X seconds or so the application flushes that data and sends it to the server.p  pIts mission critical that every single piece of data is sent successfully, Id rather send the data twice than not at all.p  h2Problemh2  pAs a test I set up the app to send data with a timestamp every 5 seconds, this means that every 5 seconds a new line appear on the server.br If I kill the server I expect the lines to stop, they should now be written to memory instead.p  pWhen I enable the server again I should be able to confirm that no events are missing.p  pThe problem however is that when I kill the server it takes about 20 seconds for IO operations to start failing meaning that during those 20 seconds the app happily sends the events and removes them from memory but they never reach the server and are lost forever.p  pI need a way to make certain that the data actually reaches the server.p  pThis is possibly one of the more basic TCP questions but non the less, I havent found any solution to it.p  h2Stuff Ive triedh2  ul liSetting a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferencejavanetSocket.htmlsetTcpNoDelaybooleancodeSocket.setTcpNoDelaytruecodeali liRemoving all buffered writers and just using a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferencejavaioOutputStream.htmlcodeOutputStreamcodea directlyli liFlushing the stream after every sendli ul  h2Additional infoh2  pI cannot change how the server responds meaning I cant tell the server to acknowledge the data more than mechanics of TCP that is, the server will just silently accept the data without sending anything back.p  h2Snippet of codeh2  pbInitialization of the classbp  precodesocket  new Sockethost, port socket.setTcpNoDelaytrue codepre  pbWhere data is sentbp  precodewhiledataList.isEmpty      String data  dataList.removeFirst     inMemoryCount  data.length     try          OutputStream os  socket.getOutputStream         os.writedata.getBytes         os.flush          catchIOException e          inMemoryCount  data.length         dataList.addFirstdata         socket  null         return false        return true codepre  hr  h2Update 1h2  pIll say this again, I cannot change the way the server behaves.br It receive data over TCP and UPD and does not send any data back to confirm the receive.

What I am worried about however is that every time I connect to the server I have to send a short string identifying who I am.p  pThe string itself is not that long around 30 characters but that adds up if I close and open the socket too often.p  pOne solution is only to flush the data every X bytes, the problem is I have to choose X wisely if too big there will be too much duplicate data sent if the socket goes down and if its too small the overhead is too big.p  hr  h2Final updateh2  pMy final solution is to flush the socket by closing it every X bytes and if all didnt got well those X bytes will be sent again.p  pThis will possibly create some duplicate events on the server but that can be filtered there.p

Negative 40852 pAs it stands I am using a JSF request scoped bean to do all my CRUD operations. As Im sure you most likely know Tomcat doesnt provide container managed persistence so in my CRUD request bean I am using EnityManagerFactory to get fold of enity manager. Now about the validity of my choice to use request scoped bean for this task, its probably open for a discussion again but Ive been trying to put it in the context of what Ive read in the articles you gave me links to, specifically the first and second one. From what I gather EclipseLink uses Level 2 cache by default which stored cached entity. On ExlipseLink Examples  JPA Caching website it says thatp  pstrongThe shared cache exists for the duration of the persistence unit  EntityManagerFactory, or serverstrongp  pNow doesnt that make my cached entities live for a fraction of time during the call that is being made to the CRUD request bean because the moment the bean is destroyed and with it EntityManagerFactory then so is the cache. Also the last part of the above sentence EntityManagerFactory, strongor serverstrong gets me confused .. what precisely is meant by strongor serverstrong in this context and how does one control it. If I use the Cache annotation and set appropriate amount of expire attribute, will that do the job and keep the entities stored on the servers L2 cache than, regardless of whether my EntityManagerFactory has been destroyed p  pI understand there is a lot of consideration to do and each application has specific requirements . From my point of view configuring L2 cache is probably the most desirable if not only, on Tomcat option to get things optimized. Quoting from your first linkp  blockquote   pThe advantages of L2 caching arep      ul   liavoids database access for already loaded entitiesli   lifaster for reading frequently accessed unmodified entitiesli   ul      pThe disadvantages of L2 caching arep      ul   limemory consumption for large amount of objectsli   listale data for updated objectsli   liconcurrency for write optimistic lock exception, or pessimistic lockli   libad scalability for frequent or concurrently updated entitiesli   ul      pYou should configure L2 caching for entities that arep      ul   liread oftenli   limodified infrequentlyli   linot critical if staleli   ul blockquote  pAlmost all of the above points apply to my app. At the heart of it, amongst other things, is constant and relentless reading of entities and displaying them on the website the app will serve as a portal for listing properties. Theres also a small shopping cart being build in the application but the products sold are not tangible items that come as stock but services. In this case stale entities are no problem and also, so I think, isnt concurrency as the products here services will never be written to. So the entities will be read often, and they will be modified infrequently and those modified are not part of the cart anyway, an even those are modified rarely and therefore not critical if stale. Finally the first two points seem to be exactly what I need, namely avoidance of database access to already loaded entities and fast reading of frequently accessed unmodified enteties. But there is one point in disadvantages which still concerns me a bit memory consumption for large amount of objects. Isnt it similar to my original problemp  pMy current understanding is that there are two options, only one of which applies to my situationp  ol lipTo be able to delegate the job of longer term caching to the persistence layer than I need to have access to PersistenceContext and create a session scoped bean and set PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED. this options doesnt apply to me, no access to PersistenceContext.pli lipConfigure the L2 Cache annotation on entities, or like in option 1 above create a session scoped bean that will handle long term caching. But arent these just going back to my original problempli ol  pId really like to hear you opinion and see what do you think could be a reasonable way to approach this, or perhaps how you have been approaching it in your previous projects. Oh, and one more thing, just to confirm.. when annotating an entity with Cache all linked entities will be cached along so I dont have to annotate all of themp  pAgain all the comments and pointers much appreciated.p  hr  pThanks for you r answer .. when you say p  blockquote   pIn Tomcat you would be best to have some static manager that holds onto the EntityManagerFactory for the duration of the server.p blockquote  pDoes it mean I could for example declare and initialize static EntityManagerFactory field in an application scoped been to be later used by all the beans throughout the life of the application  p

How can i implement my View in an openGL application in a sense off throw those polygons on my view. Is that even possible, does openGL work that way Thing with it is that i could pick an empty project drop some lines of code and have my projected triangle on screen with no need of an MVC design pattern.

Negative 40852 pUsing VS2010 and .NET 4.0 with C and WinFormsp  pI always want a Vertical Scrollbar to show for my panel as a disabled scrollbar when its not needed, and a enabled one when it can be used.p  pSo its like a hybrid AutoScroll. Ive tried using VScrollBars but I cant figure out where to place them to make this work.p  pEssentially Ive got a user control that acts as a Document of controls, its size changes so when using autoscroll it works perfectly. The scrollbar appears when the usercontrol doesnt fit and the user can move it updown.p  pIts like a web browser essentially. However, redrawing controls takes a long time its forms with many fields and buttons etc within groups in a grid within a panel Pp  pSo anyhow, when autoscroll enables the vertical scrollbar, it takes a while to redraw the window. Id like to ALWAYS show the vertical scrollbar as indicated above with the enabledisable functionality.p  pIf anyone has some help, ive read many posts on the subject of autoscroll, but noone has asked what Im asking and I cant come up with a solution.p

Something like php document content extraction for noobs, that will start from the abcs of it.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 40852 pI know this is an old question and must have been answered hundred times already, but I am not able to find a satisfactory response as yet.p  pI am creating an application which will be used by other applications mobile web to fetch the data. Now I have 2 options, 1. to create my application as a simple web application 2. To create a web service. p  pA web service looks more sophisticated where any client will provide the data in a specified format SOAP REST and my app will parse the request and return the data asked by client. How the data will be used is not my apps problem.p  pMy question is that same can be achieved by a simple web app accepting the request in XML format and responding with an XML response. Gut feeling is that a web service will be a better way to go for this kind of service where we are not sure who all will be using it. But are there any specific advantages of using a web service over a simple web appp

Now im ready to build out procedures for my entire schema.  Id like to generate those stored procedures via T4 templates from my edmx model.  I see a number of dated blog posts concerning this but the links are broken and the pictures are missing so its hard to see the examples.  If anyone has any T4 templates that generate stored procedures that are compatible with EF4 identity inserts dont take output parameters for example.  Once I get these templates created, Ill post them somewhere findable so others in this situation can same some time.p

Negative 40852 pI have an application that is written in C, Visual Studio 2005 running exclusively in Windows XP.  When the application is launched it read a large number  20000 of text files .nfo which contain XML.  Each file is 800bytes.p  pWhen the application is launched after a cold reboot, it takes 10 minutes to read the files.  However, if I close it and relaunch it, it only takes 10 seconds to read them. If I do a warm reboot, it also takes 10 seconds. If I clear the cache using the cacheset utility, it also takes 10 seconds to read the files.  If I do a cold reboot of the computer, dont touch the computer for 2 hours, launch the application, it still takes 10 minutes to launch. p  pI uses basic function from the standard library std to openreadclose the files. p  pI believe that the problem does not come directly from the implementation of the application but from Windows XP. p  pMy current focus is given to Windows XPs Prefetcher. My application has a .pf file located in the prefetch directory.  However, none of my .nfo text file are located in the list of the file to prefetch. For example, in the prefetch file associated with Internet Explorer, you can see that its temporary files such as pictures are listed in the prefetch file.  I believe that if I could force my file to appear in that list the openread operations on them would be faster as Windows would already know where they are  locted on the disk. p  pWhy arent my files located in the .pf prefetch file along with my DLL  What is the condition for a file to appear in a prefetch file p  pDoes this make sense p  pI was also wondering if there is a way to force Windows XP to prefetch a full directory or a list of files p  pThis is an already commercialised product that is sold with a computer. Therefore, we have full access to tweak the OS.  However, we have not plan to do extrem alteration to our application.p  pRegardsp

Negative 40852 pIm trying to create a list of all the overlapping subarrays of equal size from a larger 3D array for patchbased segmentation where each subarray needs to be flattened as a 1D vector so I can make use of the ball tree in sklearn.neighbours.BallTree. p  pSo for example, given a 100x100x100 image, if I were to break this down into 5x5x5 overlapping patches subarrays, I would have 96x96x96  884,736 of them.p  pHowever I have not found any way of doing so without numpy allocating more memory for each flattenedvectorized subarray. This seems to be because each subarray is not contiguous in memory.p  pe.g. For the 100x100x100 image, if I want each 5x5x5 patch as a 1D vector of length 125, numpy decides to allocate a brand new array in memory for all 884,736 of them which then becomes rather large especially if I want to work with more than a single 100x100x100 imagep  pI would welcome any solutions for overcoming this memory challenge in pythonnumpy. I was considering creating a subclass of the numpy.ndarray object which stores a pointer to the location of the patch in the bigger image and but returns the data as a 1D numpy array only when called and this is then deleted again when not used but I have not come across enough details on subclassing ndarray objects to do so. I will be really disappointed if the only solution is to implement everything in CC instead. I appreciate any help that can be provided, thanksp

Anyone with ideas on how to debug this or any clever workarounds would be awesome.p  pThe problemp  pIm making a simple WYSIWYG editor in Firefox using contenteditable.  The problem appears when I load the text to edit via ajax.  Before the load, the cursor appears fine for a split second, and once the text loads it disappears.  You can still enter text, and the cursor is definitely still there a status box shows the current linecol just fine, but the cursor is not visible and the selection overlay does not appear.  p  pHeres what makes this really strange  clicking ANYWHERE, on any other dom element, on firebug, even on another window  makes the cursor return and behave like normal.  In fact, the only time the cursor has any problems is at the very beginning, when initially loading the page or on refresh.  Clicking anywhere inside the contentedtiable div does not fix it  you have to click outside for it to refresh.  p  pRight now, I just need a workaround.  Ive tried 500 flavors of someelement.click or somelement.focus, but they dont fully replicate an actual click from a user.p  pHas anyone seen anything like this before  Thanks.  p

Negative 40852 pOK, I tend to avoid using commands because they always manage to confuse the hell out of me, but Im on a new project and am trying to architect it correctly with no code behind on my view.

Negative 40852 pSo I am trying to develop a WPF app that will allow me to turn off the auto zoom and auto focus abilities of my webcam. Im using the Emgu c wrapper for opencv and want to be able to do frame differencing without my camera auto focusing when an object comes into the screen. I have tried looking for an sdk that would allow me to develop something like this but apparently logitech ditched theirs a couple of years ago. I am using an HD pro Webcam c920. I have heard that maybe you can use the dlls that shipped with it to tweak the options but I have no idea how to do this. Any help would be awesome. Thank you.p

Negative 40852 pTo be clear, I have already found a way of accomplishing what I wanted to using XSLT, but it strikes me as largely inefficient and I would like to see if it is possible to use a different solution because it would aid in writing future stylesheets.p  pAlso, I sincerely apologize for the following paragraphs verbosity.p  pMinimally, I am trying to extract from a story written in Russian and encoded in XML pavlova.xml  unfortunately way too large of a file to post with my question but it isnt completely necessary data which would be useful for generating a pie chart in SVG.  Im trying to store this data in a variable called chartData.  A given pie chart will pertain to a target character a parameter overall, and each separate chunk of the pie will represent a speaker another character, their sizes indicating how much each speaker spoke of the target character relative to other speakers.  I began by iterating over all of the speakers any character that ever mentioned the target character and then determining the quantity of times the characters name showed up in the particular speakers speech.  However, these values are only useful in relation to the sum total of times that the character was spoken of.  I need the total in order to calculate percentages to generate the pie graph.  I am aware that I am able to separately calculate this in another variable, but I am interested in seeing if I can store a sequence of nodes in a variable.  Calculating the sum separately seems wasteful since it traverses a path nearly identical to the one that finds the individual counts, where it would be much more efficient to just sum the individual values after they are retrieved.  So far, I have been able to calculate everything I want, but I am trying instead to iterate over a variable using an xslforeach and have it recognize my variable as a sequence.p  pI want the format of the variable to be thisp  precodeltcount namespeaker1gt     ltxslvalueof selectspokenCount1gt ltcountgt ltcount namespeaker2gt     ltxslvalueof selectspokenCount2gt ltcountgt ... codepre  pIve tried many ways of solving this issue that Im not sure is possible to solve.  First was more accurately defining the content of the xslvariable specifically, trying to define its content as a sequence by using the as attribute, but Im finding it difficult to locate and comprehend documentation on that attribute and how SequenceTypes work.  Secondly, I tried playing around with how I put the content into my variable directly putting the foreach within the variable and either using xslvalueof or xslcopyof, versus declaring the variable and using xslcopyof in an external foreach to append data to the variable.p  pIt seems that xslcopyof, as opposed to xslsequence ironically is what I need to append a sequence of nodes.  I was only able to obtain the format I described above with the following codep  precodeltxslvariable namechartDatagt     ltxslforeach         selectdistinctvaluesspeech[.name[notparentnonspeech and .ref eq character]]speakergt         ltxslcopyof selectchartDatagt         ltxslvariable namespeaker selectcurrentgt         ltxslvariable namespokenCount             selectdocumentpavlova.xmlcountspeech[speaker eq speaker]name[notparentnonspeech and .ref eq character]gt         ltcount namespeakergt             ltxslvalueof selectspokenCountgt         ltcountgt     ltxslforeachgt     ltxslvariable namespokenTotal selectsumchartDatagt     ltxslvalueof selectchartDatagt     ltxslforeach selectchartDatacountgt         ...     ltxslforeachgt codepre  pThe end goal is to make the commented out foreach loop at the bottom iterate over each count element instead of giving me an error.  My question is, can I treat a variable as XML and iterate over each count element if it looks like the following, or is it always treated as a stringp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltcount nameyoungmangt4ltcountgt ltcount nameolgagt24ltcountgt ltcount namececilijagt34ltcountgt ltcount nameblondegt1ltcountgt ltcount nameveragt32ltcountgt ltcount nameservantfemgt6ltcountgt ltcount namevalickajagt20ltcountgt ltcount namemusegt66ltcountgt ltcount nameviktorgt4ltcountgt ltcount namedmitrijgt15ltcountgt ltcount nameannagt11ltcountgt ltcount nameilievgt3ltcountgt ltcount namenarodgt1ltcountgt ltcount namesocietymangt3ltcountgt codepre  pAnd if so, howp  pAlso, if someone could explain, why does xslcopyof only deepcopy when I have the foreach outside of the variables scope and set select to chartData  If I try to use xslcopyof within the variable it only copies the text content of the literal codeltcountgtcode elements and creates a string 424341326206641511313.p

Negative 40852 pBecause if Instruments is run and Activities Monitor is chosen, the app running on iPhone 4S is using 4.88MB if the contexts are released, and is also 4.88MB if the contexts are strongemnotemstrong released.  So does that mean releasing context is optional  I thought it is required actually.  The contexts were referenced by codeCGContextRefcode variables. ARC is being used.p  pThe contexts were codeCGBitmapContextcode, created for the Retina display, so at about 640 x 640, and there are 4 such contexts, which are all created in codeviewDidAppearcode, and I thought if 1 pixel is 4 bytes, then each context will be 1.6MB already.  Could it be that after the codeviewDidAppearcode is done, the contexts were automatically released  Basically, I generated codeCGImagecode objects from those bitmap contexts and set the CGImage objects to be pointed to by the codeCALayercode objects using codelayer.contents  bridge id cgImagecode, so the bitmap contexts were no longer required.  It is compiled using Xcode 4.3, with ARC, and targeted towards iOS 4.3. but I thought codeCGContextRefcode is not part of ARC.p  pstrongupdatestrong correction it should be generate CGImage objects from those CGBitmapContext, and set those CGImage objects to CALayer the original question is edited to reflect that.p

Negative 40852 pSay, I have a feature vector codeveccode, which is actually a picture stretched.

So, is there such a function Thank you.p

Negative 40852 pI have an issue which I hope I will solve by writing this question but if not I will post and see if anyone can help.p  pI am using a client library which is poorly written I feel to interact with a real time chat server that utilises COMET style longpolling over HTTP. Im having issues with cancelling the longpoll in certain situations and suspect I may need to add some concurrency handling code but am finding it hard to work out the best way to do this for the below reasons.p  pstrongThe subscribing codestrong that inits the long poll is implemented as a big loop with the followingp  precodedoLongPoll      whiletrue              IF channel field boolean unsubscribe  TRUE, if so BREAK         perform GET request and store channel HTTPClient used for this call         remove HTTPClient used for this call         IF channel field boolean unsubscribe  true, if so BREAK         IF connection problem sleep1500 then CONTINUE         post received data to listeners       codepre  pstrongThe unsubscribe callstrong that will called on another threadp  precodeunsubscribe      set channel field boolean unsubscribe  FALSE     get channel HTTPClient and shutdown  codepre  pI have isolated the problem case where the operations are interleaving. To me this seems a result of the code being multithreaded and the client code not being thread safe. Also poor management and nonreuse of the codehttpClientcode is not helping.p  pOne of the issues Im having is below where the unsubscribe call does not stop the next getRequest from taking place.p  precodeTHREAD 1 polling                      THREAD 2                                  do unsubscribe check pass                                         unsubscribe called                                         set unsubscribe  true                                         check if httpClient saved none perform getRequest save HttpClient first codepre  pI would like to know what people think the best approach to this problem would be time is also limited so I cant rewrite too much of the codep  pTo fix this i would thought i could use a strongsyncronisation blockstrong from the first unsubscribe check on thread 1 up to the point the codehttpClientcode is saved just before the actual get request is performed and syncronise the unsubscribe method using the same lock. This is not practical at the moment as the first sync block mentioned would start in one method call and finish further down the method call chain due to how the lib is written  which feels very wrong so some refactoring would be needed.p  pOR I could just create a strongsingle codehttpClientcode per channelstrong rather than per request and then it could always be shutdown and I could potentially ignore the syncronisation i think.p  pOR as suggested below I could use stronginterruptsstrong for the same purposep  pAny suggestions would be welcome  I will edit if I have any progressp  pThanks p

I am running a native linux program on an Android device emnotem NDK, but really native, and from what I gathered, JACK does not work on Android since some libc and posix stuff incompatabilities.p  pThe questionsp  p1 can I use 2 different threads, for a reading captured samples and b playing back samples All ALSA full duplex examples Ive seen just use alternating reading from  writing to the sound card with blocking functions, which seems not to work too great, especially if your program is supposed to do a little more than that.p  p2 As I understood, ALSA mixes audio played by different applications, much like the windows audio mixer. Is it possible to get exclusive access to an audio device, such that my application is guaranteed to be the only one playing back audio, with no mixing amp degrading of dynamic range going onp

Negative 40852 pSo I was looking at the settings in CM10.14.2.2 and I saw an option to change the color of the softkeys using a color picker. p  pNow im working on an app and though doing something like that would be cool. But I dont understand how it does it. How does it change the color using code, and why doesnt it require a reboot p  pAlso, could I use a similar process to change the Colorado of the wifi inside my app as well How would one do this. I am interested in how you can do this, as it would make a great addition to my app.p  pI saw I wasnt the only one wondering this, and I think this is a good question. If someone could, can you maybe explain what could be going on, and then explain how I could do it, and maybe give me a link to some code to take a look at p  pAnything would help. Im curious, but baffled. I think an answer could help not just me, but many others. Thanksp

Negative 40852 pThis question is a follow up to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15263390jsf20cdiinjectedsessionbeanwithinrequestbeancontainsnullpropertiesherea.p  pUpon login, my app needs to consult the container for authentication using request.login and then set a User bean, which contains username, password, role, and a locationspecific field.  Upon successful authorization against the container WAS 8, the users role needs to be checked to figure out the appropriate welcome page to where the user should be redirected.  My container implements a federated repository, which basically lumps together 3 LDAP branches, a database, and a flat file.  There are many roles 5 for now, probably will be more later.p  pI have 2 beans a RequestScoped Credentials bean and a SessionScoped bean named Login.  Login contains a login method.  I have a problem in side the login method.p  pMy problem is that whenever I usep  precodePrincipal userPrincipal  request.getUserPrincipal request.getUserPrincipal if userPrincipal  null      request.logout  request.logincredentials.getUsername, credentials.getPassword String name  userPrincipal.getName codepre  pbeforep  precodeDonor donor  loginService.getDonorcredentials.getUsername currentUser  new Users currentUser.setLocationdonor.getCenter.getCity currentUser.setRoleDONOR currentUser.setUserIdcredentials.getUsername currentUser.setFirstNamedonor.getFirstName currentUser.setLastNamedonor.getLastName currentUser.setUsernamecredentials.getUsername currentUser.setNamecredentials.getUsername return usersfacesredirecttrue codepre  pmy currentUser User bean isnt stored in the session.p  pIve removed the first chunk of code and noticed that my User beans info is then stored in the session and can be viewed on the subsequent users page.  Ive reintroduced the first chunk of code line by line and noticed thatp  precodeif userPrincipal  null      request.logout  codepre  pcauses the problem.p  pHow the heck am I supposed to store a User bean implementing programmatic security and JSF2.0CDI  Ive spent weeks on this.  I can imagine implementing something more elaborate like a filter that catches the redirect, grabs the userprincipal, calls the db or ldap for additional attributes, and then redirects to the appropriate page...but I want to keep things simple.  There has got to be a simple way to do this.p  pI originally tried my hand at login using jsecuritycheck and specifying FORM in web.xml.  Now, using a JSF 2.0 form and a login method, I noticed that FORM gets ignored in favor of BASIC. System.out.printlngetAuthType..  request.getAuthType returns BASIC within the login method.  This results in an annoying cache, which is why request.logout is required.  Otherwise, request.login will fail.p  pI stumbled across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10154202howdoidosecurityinjsfthisa last night, which contains a link to a hrefhttpsblogs.oracle.comenterprisetechtipsentryimprovingjsfsecurityconfigurationwith relnofollowherea.  So, there may be a way to obtain the userprincipal, set a User bean, and redirect to an appropriate welcome page.  I dont know how outdated that 2nd link is though.  It also seems to be the case that jsecuritycheck cant be used in tandem with a programmatic means of determining which page I should redirect a user to based on role.p  pAs to whether I should use jsecuritycheck or programmatic securityJSFCDI, I just need to figure out something that is simple and allows me to store the Login bean or an independent User bean in the session.p  pHeres my login

Negative 40852 pI am designing a schema for ECommerce app, in which I would have 3 tables i.e Orders, Products, Customers.p  pSo Should we store customerid and productid in Orders table straightaway.p  pThe limitation to this is when a product or customer updates their attributes i.e product price or customer name , the orders table doesnt reflect them.p  pFor Ex A Customer bought a product at 10, but later on the product price gets updated to 20.So now when we are referring to this order by product id we would get the result as it was bought at 20 instead of 10.p  pSOLUTION 1p  pOne solution would be to insert a new row into products table whenever an updates occur and perform a soft delete to that product so that it can be referenced from orders table.p  pSOLUTION 2p  pStore most of the details in product and customer details in orders table.p  pSOLUTION 3 p  pCreate a temporary table of customers and products whenever there is an update to these tables.p  pI am very much open to any other suggestions.p

Negative 40852 pSorry for being very vague but I do not know the name of the concept.  I will try to explain.  Ill try to put it in terms of animals to make it easy.p  pI have a generic superclass.  This superclass contains functions that all animals have to do.  For example I do not want to redefine takebreath sub in every animal subclass, so I define it once inside the Animals superclass and all of the animals AnimalsCat, AnimalsDog, and AnimalsLlama can simply access selftakebreath.  The animals also go through many of the same initialization routines so as opposed to redefining them every time I simply call classSUPERnew as well as do things specific to that animal.p  pWith this being said every time an animal is initialized it goes through its superclasses initialization routines.  There are hundreds of animals and these are run hundreds of times.  Its not too big of a problem.p  pThese animals are smart however and know how to use the LWPUserAgent web browser.  In order to access the internet they must log into a web page and set their session cookies.  They all share the same login and would like to share the same browser.  In my current implementation the login routines are part of the superclasss new method.  This means when an animal is initialized this runs and the animal logs in.  As I said I have hundreds of animals and do not want to fire off hundreds of POST requests.  I would like to somehow fire off the login routine once and make it part of the super class.  Each animal can then access the shared web browser by doing selfua.p  pI hope this explains it, I am not sure what this OOP term is called.p  pstrongTLDR for those who dont like Animalsstrongp  pI have a login routine in the superclass that creates an LWPUserAgent, logs in, and sets session cookies.  The subclasses can all share one login.  I do not want to have to fire off hundreds of POST requests to log in for each subclass.  I would like to somehow log in once and share the prepared ua object wil all subclasses.p

Here is the code sample they providep  precodevoid sortPointersvoid ar, int n, intcmpconst void , const void       int j     forj  1 j lt n j          int i  j  1         void value  ar[j]          whilei gt 0 ampamp cmpar[i], value gt 0              ar[i1]  ar[i]             i                   ar[i1]  value       codepre  pHere is what I added to have a working examplep  precodeint cmpconst void t1, const void t2      ift1 gt t2          return 1          else ift2 gt t1          return 1          else          return 0        void main      int values[]   51, 3, 5, 60, 9, 2, 7      sortPointersvoidvalues, 7, cmp      forint i  0 i lt 7 i          cout ltlt values[i] ltlt          codepre  pWhile this works I do not completely understand why and how Also, why does the void  cast in the main function work, why did they use a double pointer indirection etc. p  pBack in school the only place we used multiple indirection was when dynamically allocating multidimensional arrays. The only other use I know of, is when you need to be able to modify the address the pointer you are passing to the method holds. p  pFurthermore I went ahead and modified the code to look like this and it works just finep  precodevoid sortPointers2int arr, int n, int cmpint, int      int j     forj  1 j lt n j          int i  j  1         int value  arr[j]          whilei gt 0 ampamp cmparr[i], value gt 0               arr[i1]  arr[i]             i                   arr[i1]  value        int cmp2int t1, int t2      ift1 gt t2          return 1          else ift2 gt t1          return 1          else          return 0        void main      int values[]   51, 3, 5, 60, 9, 2, 7      sortPointers2values, 7, cmp2      forint i  0 i lt 7 i          cout ltlt values[i] ltlt          codepre  pIm pretty sure I am missing something fundamental and obvious. Thank you for anybody reading this and chipping in with an idea or two. Let me know if you need any additional details or if I messed up the terminology.p  pEDIT fixed typo in the first cmp functionp

Negative 40852 pI have a simple project to test JAXRS services. Yesterday I downloaded jersey1.7.1 and used com.sun.jersey.api.container.httpserver.HttpServerFactory and com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer to create a http server to test my services from inside eclipse wo a heavy weight containerp  pToday, I downloaded the latest jersey jars jaxrsri and the HttpServerFactory is missing. Looks like they removed the class between 1.7.1  2.0 but I cannot find it in deprecated section. I see grizzly2 classes in API section maybe that is what I am supposed to use now but none of the jars in jaxrsri bundle provide those classes. I downloaded the jerseygrizzly 1.12 jar but it only has comsunjerseyserverimplcontainergrizzly2GrizzlyContainer classes and no implementation.p  pSo question to kind soulsp  p1  with the latest jaxrsri jars from jersey download page, what is the recommended way to create a simple http server to test from command line if the 1.7.1 way has been deprecated. what jars to downloadinclude and perhaps a short code sample p  p2  The whole documentation around creating a simple REST service using java is a big mess.

Negative 40852 pp I have a rather large legacy nmake Win32 project that creates a static library from native C code. I need to use this library in a C.Net application.  In the past after much effort I had been successful at wrapping the static library in a managed C library, which I am then able to reference in a C.Net application.  However, after receiving updates from the developers of the nmake project, and having gone through an many upgrades on my own build machine in the meantime, it is no longer working. p I am however able to import the cpp and header files of the nmake project and build it to a Win32 static library in VS 2010, by setting all of the preprocessor constants in the build properties.  I set the build configuration type to DLL, and then try to add a reference to the Win32 output in my C.Net application hoping to use PInvoke down the road, and it fails with a message A reference to MyLibrary could not be added.  p Is there a way to build the Win32 library so that it can be referenced by the C.Net project and so that I can use PInvokep

Negative 40852 pI have a list of football results in one table, each row is a match and contains all data from that match i.e. Hometeam, HomeGoals, AwayGoals, Awayteam, I want to cycle through each match, get the home team, check their last 6 matches and display only the matches where the specified team scored 4 goals or more in at least one of their last 6 matches.p  pI have the following code which creates a table, partitions by team name and numbers every row based on the date of their game, then runs through the table again and displays only the games that meet the criteria specified above.p  pThe problem is I need the Last6 table to update itself based on the date of the game being referenced in the main query, so that I get the last 6 games from that date.

Negative 40852 pI have created several custom server controls in the past, these arent user controls, so there is no ascx file to use. Im given an MVC project to mimic the same kind of functionality that I wrote using the server controls. Basically the server control is a composite control, so it has a few textboxes, labels, checkboxes, and it has some javascript that comes with it. It also binds that functionality to a few webservices as well.p  pIm wondering if its possible to insert this control somewhere into an MVC page, or if I should rebuild this functionality from scratch purely using HTML helpers. Im thinking the later.p  pIm kind of a beginner when it comes to custom html helpers. Can I treat programming custom html helpers the same way as programming server side controlsp  pBtw, I need to add this example url to show what Im talking about  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa719734vvs.71.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa719734vvs.71.aspxap  pWhenever I mentioned server side controls, people are assuming native ASP.NET controls, or user controls, whereas Im talking about custom server side controls.p  pI went with the custom server control approach a few months back because it made deployment extremely easy and easy to add to other .net projects. Since it wraps everything up in a dll, and all youd have to do is recycle the pool. But it seems MVC says, Nope, you arent going to do that with me.p  pAny advice, tips, or links on how to approach this would be helpful.p  pBtw, I wouldnt be posting here if it was easy to find on the net. Most examples I found talked only about user controls or native asp server controls, nothing about custom server controls. I just dont want to do this functionality all over again and go through that headache.p

Negative 40852 pThere is a need to have a calculator for our invoices which will be used both in the web UI and in the backend. This requires two implementations of the same logic in Javascript and C and the real problem is to keep these two logics in sync when it comes to changing the rules. p  pAt the moment, what we do in the JS side is that we send all the requests for recalculations to the backend through ajax calls in order to use the calculator implemented in C.

Negative 40852 pI have been trying for in excess of a week at any spare opportunity to make this email form work. Its based on a web tutorial for what appears to be a far earlier version of Joomla, as much of its language appears to have been superseded. Ive changed bits around accordingly, but may have missed some rather obvious parts, as Im probably a little out of my depth with this, but am determined to get it rightp  pIm writing this as a module so I can call it at any point on a Joomla page by using loadmodule contact.p  pThe form loads up on the page correctly, except when I make certain changes and introduce a HTTP internal server error 500 with no further explanation.p  pIf I leave the form action as index.php as the tutorial had, it finishes me up on the index page of the Joomla site with no email. If I take the action out, as other tutorials or answers on here recommend, it clears the form, but appears to take a moment or two to process whats there  but still no email.p  pTheres nothing wrong with the Joomla install or its ability to email  its a fresh install with two pages, and its been tested as sending user confirmation emails correctly.p  pIm rusty with PHP and have spent most of my time going over this character by character and searching commands to ensure Ive got them right, so it might be something simple that Ive just missed. I may also have the logic of the entire thing wrong, but it emseemsem right to me.p  pTheres very little about writing this type of thing from scratch online at all  most discussions either relate to, or end up suggesting, a prewritten module or component, none of which are clean or simple enough, or able to meet the ease of calling it as described above.p  pOkay, here goes.

Negative 40852 pI was trying to compile my project today, I have never had any trouble compiling this project before on multiple platforms, but trying on Mac OS X using g 4.2.1 in release mode which uses the O2 optimisation flag caused the compilation to get stuck forever on the same file. Playing around with the code, I narrowed the problems down to essentially this codep  precodevoid MyClassSendBigMessage      int Offset  0     PackByteArrayIntoMessageSomeDataArray1, SomeDataArray1Size, Offset     PackByteArrayIntoMessageSomeDataArray2, SomeDataArray2Size, Offset      ...snip     PackByteArrayIntoMessageSomeDataArray9, SomeDataArray9Size, Offset     PackByteArrayIntoMessageSomeDataArray10, SomeDataArray10Size, Offset      SendMessageMessage   void MyClassPackByteArrayIntoMessageunsigned char ByteArray, int Size, int ampOffset      forint i  0 i lt Size i              Message.SetByteAtOffsetByteArray[i], Offset       codepre  pCommenting out the body of the codePackByteArrayIntoMessagecode means the file compiles without problem. Also, commenting out all of the calls to codePackByteArrayIntoMessagecode, but leaving the body of the function commented in, means the file compiles without problem. When I start commenting in more calls to it, the compile time seems to get exponentially longer, until, with about 10 sequential calls to it, it seems to hang compiling the file forever.p  pI guessed gcc was trying to do some clever optimisations, so I played around with the codePackByteArrayIntoMessagecode until it started compiling again, this implementation worked finep  precodevoid MyClassPackByteArrayIntoMessageunsigned char ByteArray, int Size, int ampOffset      forint i  0 i lt Size i              Message.SetByteAtOffsetByteArray[i], Offset  i          Offset  Offset  Size  codepre  pI can only assume this is a bug in gcc 4.2.1, as compiling with gcc 4.4.0 using O2 on Linux works fine with no code modifications.p  pSo my question is, what exactly is the compiler trying to do that causes the hanging problem I looked through the release notes of some gcc versions but I couldnt find anything referencing this particular issue. Also, is there a way to mark code segments to make sure they are not optimisedp

Negative 40852 pI am wondering if you can run Ant on a buildfile that would be located inside a JAR.  The reason why I am interested in this is because I would like to include a deploy target in my buildfile that could be called after the jar has been moved to its destination.  That deploy target would take care of extracting resources and other libraries required to run the program.p  pSo, for instance, I would package up properties, images and external jars inside of my jar when building.  The deployment process would then consist of moving the jar to the location it is meant to run in, and call codeant ltsomeOptiongt myjar.jarbuild.xml deploycode or something like that.p  pDoes that make sensep

Negative 40852 pI am working on a system that has lots of tasks that are perfect for queueing and has some existing home made legacy solutions already in place that work to varying degrees, I am familiar with gearman and have read through the RabbitMQ tutorials and am keen to codeupgradecode the current solutions to use one of these more robust existing solutions leaning towards rabbitMQ atm because of the flexibility and scalability and the management plugin. p  pI am having trouble understanding how to address a problem that allows user A to queue up a large number of a jobs lets say 5000 of type A which then blocks the processing of any newly added jobs of type A until user As jobs are done. Id like to implement a solution that will fairly share the load, or even just roundrobin between the queued users.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions or insights into how I might implement a solution to this p  pI thought routingkeys might help but if User As jobs are queued before User B adds their jobs then they still wont be processed until User As jobs have been consumed p  pI have also thought of creating a queue for each user amp jobtype but I am unsure how to do this dynamically   Perhaps I need to implement some sort of control queue that sets up queues and dynamically adjusts the worker processes to consume the newly added user only queue, but would the worker collect the jobs from the queues in a roundrobin type way  And how would I decide when to remove the queues p  pthanks in advance for any help p

Negative 40852 pIm not quite sure how to explain it but ive been searching everywhere and to no avail. Please help me here. I took CSS in college but am a bit rusty. I want to have my paleontology site so that I have the dinosaurs names on the left as a scrollable option. My old version of the site was html and it was in frames. People liked the frames cause the main page wasnt affected when they searched for the dinosaur name. In the new css the entire page moves. Also when I add a dinosaur or 3 to the list I dont want to have to add it individually to over 30 pages of dinosaurs. I want to edit one page and have it affect all of them.  p  pIve created an independant page for the dinosaurs  dinolist.php But implimenting it im not sure what to do.

Negative 40852 pI am having hell with this and I know it is probably really simple. I am trying to read a text message from my Seeed GPRS shield. I have the shield setup as a software serial and I am displaying the information received from the GPRS to the serial monitor.

To display the data from the software serial to the serial monitor, I am using the following code.p  precodewhileGPRS.available0   Serial.writeGPRS.read   codepre  pGPRS is my software serial obviously. The problem is, the text is long and I only get a few characters from it. Something like this.p  blockquote   pCMGR REC READ,1511,,131209,14345424 Welcome to TM eos8p blockquote  pThis text is a Welcome to TMobile text that is much longer. The last few characters shown are scrambled. I have done some research and have seen that I can mod the serial buffer size to 256 instead of the default 64. I want to avoid this because I am sure there is an easier way. Any ideasp

Negative 40852 pWere trying to update CRM 2011 from RU 11 to RU 14 to be able to install RU 15 when RU 14 is all ready to go. Been fixing various issues concerning this update since Microsoft did quite some changes due to the Cross Platform and obviously since were moving from the 11 to the 14. p  pNow, my main issue is that I have a plugin thats running synchronously on the create of a service appointment. Its in charge of doing several things, like comparing values or using values from other entities to populate data in the Service Activity record. Regarding what the strange error is, since changes are being done on a Post Operations, a service.Updateentity has to be done in order for changes to be seen in the form and database. If I debug the code step by step everything passes smoothly except when the code reaches the .Update. When the update is called CRM throws an Unexpected Error Occured.

The only thing that changed was replacing a Thread object with an analogous Process object.p  pstrongEDITstrong After changing the open to use a instead of w, the pipe still disappears when using a process.p
Negative 40852 pIm written a basic application that watches one network File Share directory and when a new file is created in that directory it then fires an external application that parses that file.  Ive also tested with a local directory and everything worked. Ive tested it with debug code like so and the application will workp  precodeif DEBUG   Service1 mysService1  new Service1   mysService1.OnDebug calls onStartNull   System.Threading.Thread.SleepSystem.Threading.Timeout.Infinite  else   ServiceBase[] ServicesToRun   ServicesToRun  new ServiceBase[]          new Service1        ServiceBase.RunServicesToRun   System.Threading.Thread.SleepSystem.Threading.Timeout.Infinite endif codepre  pThen when I switch to release, build and install the service nothing will happen. So since the path worked i figured this was down to permissions p  pI went to codeTask ManagergtServicesgtServices..gtcode right clicked on my codeservicegtPropertiesgtLog Ongtcode and have given it my credentials. p  pIve also gone to the root folder of where my application is on the network codeRight clickgtSecuritygtEditcode. Then I gave my account Modify, Read amp Execute, Listing folder contents, and Read permissions and of course those permissions propagated to all of the folders under its hierarchy.p  pI even tried mapping it to the network drive Z and trying to access it that one.p  pWith everything I tried the service still refuses to do anything. Ive added more debugging code where I would check if the file was changed or deleted and write it down in text files. Once again it would work and detect those changes in debug but upon install nothing would happen.p  pIm pretty sure this is probably still some kind of permission issue can anyone tell me what else I could do to remedy this issuep  pEDIT p  pThere was a request for more code.

DepoMembers has a numeric PK  but has a surrogate key UserName.  UserNames are guaranteed to be unique.p  pIn Linq2SQL  to relate these tables in the designer  we add an association where User.UserName is linked to DepoMembers.UserName  and set the multiplicity of the Association to 11. then Modify the Navigation Names to singular.p  pIf we take DepoMembers as the Principal End of the relationship  it should follow that If Membership.User does not exist As in the case  where a user does not manage the application site but exist in DepoMembers the Navigation Property User will be Null.p  pHow can this be done in Code First ... p  pThe only alternative Ive come up with so far is to create a property DepoMembers.User which uses the UserName Property to retrieve the User using the datacontext. p  pRenp

Negative 40852 pI added an existing project to my solution.

The version of log4net we use is 1.2.13.0.p  pI checked with FUSLOGVW.exe for binding errors. The log4net shows up with the added assembly and some Unknown assembly.  The reference of log4net in the assembly shows version 1.2.13.0 which was added with NuGet. So it is probably a dependent assembly that is causing all this trouble. I tried changing log4net back to version 1.2.12.0, but I still get the same error message.p  pWhen I run all the tests with MSTest testrunner, these errors show up. When I only run the failed tests, they pass. When I run them individually, they also pass. I tried binding redirection, but I did it for the assembly that is tested not the testing assembly. I did not know how to do that for a test assembly  there is no config. When I run the tests with Resharper test runner they also pass but other tests fail. The TFS Build server runs the MSTestrunner, therefore I need to get it working with MSTest.p  pDoes anyone know how I can get this resolvedp

Negative 40852 pFor a project I have been working on, the ability to draw lines with a gradient I.E. they change color over the interval they are drawn would be very useful. I have an algorithm for this, as I will paste below, but it turns out to be DREADFULLY slow. Im using the Bresenham algorithm to find each point, but I fear that I have reached the limits of software rendering. Ive been using SDL2 thus far, and my line drawing algorithm appears 200x slower than codeSDLRenderDrawLinecode. This is an estimate, and gathered from comparing the two functions times to draw 10,000 lines. My function would take near 500ms, and codeSDLRenderDrawLinecode did it in 23ms on my machine. I even tested the functions with horizontal lines to ensure it wasnt just a botched Bresenham algorithm, and similar slowness hatched. Unfortunately, SDL doesnt have an API for drawing lines with a gradient or if it does, Im blind. I knew that any software rendering would be significantly slower than hardware, but the shear magnitude of slowness caught me by surprise. Is there a method that can be used to speed this up Have I just botched the drawing system beyond reason Ive considered saving an array of the pixels I wish to draw and then shoving them to the screen all at once, but I dont know how to do this with SDL2 and I cant seem to find the API in the wiki or documentation that allows for this. Would that even be fasterp  pThanks for the considerationp  precodevoid DRWLineGradientSDLRenderer rend, SDLColor c1, int x1, int y1, SDLColor c2, int x2, int y2 Uint8 tmpr, tmpg, tmpb, tmpa SDLGetRenderDrawColorrend, amptmpr, amptmpg, amptmpb, amptmpa  int dy  y2  y1 int dx  x2  x1   Use doubles for a simple gradient  double d  absx1  x2 gt absy1  y2  absx1  x2  absy1  y2 double dr  c2.r  c1.r  d double dg  c2.g  c1.g  d double db  c2.b  c1.b  d double da  c2.a  c1.a  d  double r  c1.r, g  c1.g, b  c1.b, a  c1.a   The line is vertical  if dx  0      int y     if y2 gt y1          for y  y1 y lt y2 y              SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x1, y             r  dr             g  dg             b  db             a  da                  return          else         for y  y1 y gt y2 y              SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x1, y              r  dr             g  dg             b  db             a  da                  return        The line is horizontal  if dy  0      int x     if x2 gt x1          for x  x1 x lt x2 x              SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x, y1             r  dr             g  dg             b  db             a  da                  return          else         for x  x1 x gt x2 x              SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x, y1              r  dr             g  dg             b  db             a  da                  return        The line has a slope of 1 or 1  if absdy  absdx      int xmult  1, ymult  1     if dx lt 0          xmult  1          if dy lt 0          ymult  1          int x  x1, y  y1     do          SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a         SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x, y         x  xmult         y  ymult         r  dr         g  dg         b  db         a  da      while x  x2     return    Use bresenhams algorithm to render the line   int checky  dx gtgt 1 int octant  findOctantLinex1, y1, x2, y2, dx, dy  dy  absdy dx  absdx x2  absx2  x1  x1 y2  absy2  y1  y1  if octant  1  octant  2  octant  5  octant  6      int tmp  dy     dy  dx     dx  tmp   int x, y  0 for x  0 x lt dx x      SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a     switch octant          case 0             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x  x1, y  y1             break         case 1             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, y  x1, x  y1             break         case 2             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, y  x1, x  y1             break         case 3             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x  x1, y  y1             break         case 4             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x  x1, y  y1             break         case 5             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, y  x1, x  y1             break         case 6             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, y  x1, x  y1             break         case 7             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x  x1, y  y1             break         default             break           checky  dy     if checky gt dx          checky  dx         y           r  dr     g  dg     b  db     a  da   SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, tmpr, tmpg, tmpb, tmpa  codepre  pSIDE NOTEp  pI am reluctant to just move on to using OpenGL 3.0 Which I hear SDL2 has support for because I dont know how to use it.

Negative 40852 pI have a thread safety issuequestion regarding the CommonsWare 5.9 Event Buses example.  p  pIt looks to me like there is a problem with the way the codemodelcode codeArrayListcode is accessed from multiple threads.

The consumption of codemodelcode is a little more complicated in that I dont readily have the code handy to post.  Its down somewhere inside an codeArrayAdaptercode.  The consumption of the model is triggered by a call to codeArrayAdapter.notifyDataSetChangedcode.p  pThe issuequestion I have is that codemodelcode is written to in one thread not the Android UI thread, but the consumption is happening on the UI thread.  All of the elements of the codemodelcode codeArrayListcode are immutable, which helps, but it still doesnt seem right to me.p  pIf this code is in fact correct, Id like to understand why.  Thanks, Lee.p  pUpdatep  pI dont think my problem is with the event bus part.  I think I get that. Its almost more of a java issue I have in that model is written to in one thread worker thread, code above while theoretically it could be simultaneously read from in another thread UI thread.  It seems to me that there needs to be some sort of concurrent access control in place on model.  A synchronized block or concurrent codeArrayListcode.  But the ultimate consumer of the model is code that I dont have control over in my app, its down in codeArrayAdaptercode somewhere. I cant add a synchronize to it.   Once the codeArrayAdaptercode is initialized with a model, the codeArrayAdaptercodeowns it and will access it from the UI thread.  Im not sure that a nonUI thread can modify model in this way.  p

To my amazement, the text after the ltagt tag is blue, as it should be.p  pNext I looked through the CSS to find any style elements that might affect the div, span, a, or pre tags, and put them in the CSS section on JS Bin.  The resulting formatting still looks correct, with the text after the ltagt tag still blue.p  pSo then I copied the entire CSS file and pasted it into the CSS section on JS Bin.  That broke it.  The text after the ltagt tag changed to black, which was the problem Ive been having with the page.p  pSo, somewhere in this massive CSS file there is something which is affecting how this page renders.  Why, I dont know.  Ive always been under the impression that after an inline closing tag the formatting should return to that in effect before the opening tag, but somehow something is changing that behavior.p  pIt is now about 215 AM here, so Im going to call it a day, get some sleep, and take a fresh look at it after some rest.p  pJohnp  pstrong UPDATE strongp  pIve gone through the entire page making sure that all tags are matched, the nesting correct no DIV elements inside a SPAN, etc., and it still does not format properly.p  pI cant spend any more time on it, so Ive come up with a kludge  close the span immediately before the lta href...gt and open a new ltspan classbluegt immediately after the ltagt, as shown below.  I know it shouldnt be necessary, but if that is what it takes to make it work, so be it.  So, here is the revised simplified code.p  precodeltdiv ...gt   ltdiv classdbnotesgt     ltpregt Some Text.  ltspan classbluegtLots more text that may be one line or multiple lines and is retrieved from a database in preformatted form and often has one or more  ltspangtlta href...gtlinksltagtltspan classbluegt within the preformatted text.ltspangt Some Additional text. ltspan classbluegtMore text that may be one or more lines and is reformatted  and comes from a database and often contains one or more  ltspangtlta href...gtlinksltagtltspan classbluegt  within the text.ltspangt And more text.     ltpregt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI still would like to know why the browsers are behaving in this manner.

Negative 40852 pIm working on a site with woocomerce. Im pretty sure this has been covered, but I am not sure where have looked, promise. Customers must be able to add to cart products... some are priced, others to be quoted on. She then needs to receive the order, check stock availability and get back to them with a price including shipping. So the submit cart should only send an order to her to quote on.Is there any function to make it possible or any other plugins or woocommerce extensionsp

Negative 40852 pOkay gang, this one has been driving me up a wall for three days.p  pIve written an application that pulls data from HPs Application Lifecycle Management system using their functionality. The OTAClient.dll is directly from Hewlett Packard. Namespace is actually TDAPOlib in the code however.p  pThe application itself, runs fine. All of the methods correctly pull data for other projects identified in the system. But whenever it is ran, the OTAClient.dll will inevitably explode with a 0xC000005 Access Read Violation warning that cannot be ignored. You can continue through until completion but as it is row by row this is impossible to do.p  pIve gone through and groomed the data in the system extensively to ensure that it meets the requirements of the application. I know the permissions are right. I have the most up to date OTAClient taken directly from HP. I know all methods Ive written work correctly.p  pMy only theory is that there is some kind of version conflict between the .dll and Visual Studio. I updated to Ultimate 2013 today to see if it changed anything and the application did run longer than it had before. I deleted all registry entries that might have possibly referenced. Ultimately it has to do with OTAclient not  being backwards compatible... with something. I just have no idea what it could possibly be.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3c5ol.png altenter image description herep  pThis image is taken from the call stack at the moment of the access violation. This tells me that the OTAClient is causing it.p  pMainly I am just looking for any idea as to where to look. Did I miss something Should I look somewhere elsep  pThank You for your assistance.p
Negative 40852 pI have a search bar so that when the user presses enter, the string in the search bar is sent to my ExpressJS server.

However, on the Nexus 7 and a few other devices you have to hold down the backspace for a while until it deletes the email.

Negative 40852 pIve scraped Japanese contents from online to conduct content analysis. Now I am preparing the text data, starting with creating termdocument matrix. The package I am using to clean and parse things out is RMeCab. Ive been told that this package requires text data to be in ANSI encoding.  But my data is in UTF8 encoding, as is the setting of RMeCab and the global setting within R itself.p  pIs it necessary that I change the encoding of my text files in order to run RMeCab In that case, how do I convert the encoding of tens of thousands of separate text files quicklyp  pI tried encoding conversion websites, which give me some gibberish as an ANSI output.  I do not understand the mechanism behind inputting something that looks like a bunch of question marks into RMeCab.  If I successfully converted encoding to ANSI and my text data look like a bunch of symbols, would RMeCab still be able to read it as Japanese textp

What I want to do is make my AMI point at a different snapshot to use as its root drive a snapshot with the new program installed and things would be all well and good. But, I cant find a way to do this. Someone from Amazon on the forums said its not possible, but Im not so sure.

Negative 40852 pWhen reading about codecs, encoding and decoding I found that i should use the encode function on the string directly and that worked fine. Ive after that read about what the unicode and ascii is in addition to the different utf encodings.p  pBut when reading further i found that most people seem to import the codecs module and use encode from the module. I dont see much of a difference between String.encode and codecs.encode.. does it matter which one i use  Im just specifying the encoding i need in the encode function.p  pAlso, when reading this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11339955pythonstringencodedecodepython string encode  decodea i looked at the link in the accepted answer which shows a slide show which is suppose to completely demystify unicode and utf but on one of the slides he says that utf is used to translate numbers to characters which i cant see is correct. p  pFrom my understanding based on a hrefhttpwww.rrn.dkthedifferencebetweenutf8andunicode relnofollowhttpwww.rrn.dkthedifferencebetweenutf8andunicodea which was also quoted in another SO thread utf is not translating numbers to characters. Its translating binary numbers to numbers found in the unicode or the other choosen character set being used. So utf would be translation of a binary number to a number and then unicode would be translating that number again to a character..so he got it wrong when trying to completely mystify thisp

Negative 40852 pI am developing an android app which handles a lot of text. Im confused at the data storage and retrieval, Which one should i use for faster data retrieval Sqlite or file storage json files, separate file for each category . First I thought about sqlite because it is more easy to manage data, but it will take sometime to create tables with almost 1000 rows in each table or i have to ship the database with my app and it will increase the download size and then i thought about file storage. Which one should i use, sqlite or json file as the data creation is a one time process an the rest is retrieval Can anyone suggest a better way, im really, really confused.p

Negative 40852 pI have a Nios system with Qsys components such as Interval timer, UART, SDRAM and some PIOs. My system specifications are DE0 Nano, Quartus 12.1 sp1, Altera monitor program. Nios II system are interfacing with several VHDL blocks.p  pI am able to read data from FPGA to Nios processor, then transmit this data to Uart component created in Qsys using direct register method IORDALTERAAVALONUARTSTATUS UARTBASE  IOWRALTERAAVALONUARTTXDATAUARTBASE, txdataetc.p  pI am using USBtoSerial interface to the board FTDI UM245R module.p  pI am able to read serial port and plot the graph real time in Matlab. However, I am having the issue where the data is not updated as frequent as desired.p  pIn my C code, I want the parameter say parameter A to be updated every 0.2 seconds, so I expect to see 30 sets of data being updated within 6 seconds, however, it is only updated 3 sets within 6 seconds, I can see that the sequenceorder it updates is correct, just that it is updated slower that it is supposed to be.p  pI suspect two reasons 1.Interval timer core, so I change the timer from 0.2 seconds to 0.1 seconds, it makes no difference to the results though 2. Matlab code, timeout parameter, I set it to be 5 seconds, if I set it less than this, I will get an error saying the serial data not returned within the timeout period.p  pI am asking if anyone of you has encountered this problem, could you please tell me what are the perspectives for me to look into as I dont know what is wrong and what is causing this problem.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 40852 pim fairly new to programming. i want to modify the decimal pad system keyboard so that when a user selects a particular text field, a decimal keyboard will appear.  i dont want the alphabet characters that are present in the current system keyboard but otherwise they keyboard will be the same.  i dont want to use an extension for a completely new keyboard as i know that will require a way to change keyboards for the user which i absolutely dont want.  i just want a minor tweak of the apple decimal keyboard.  from what i have researched so far i was led to custom views and input accessory views for data input in the apple documentation.  however, this documentation is in objective c which i am not familiar with.  just wondering what the best way would be to embark on this.  thank you very much.p

Negative 40852 pIm using SSIS SQL Maintenance Tasks rather than the built in SQL Server Maintenance Tasks within SQL Server Studio because I find SSIS more flexible. I noticed that the Maintenance Cleanup Task uses xpdeletefile under the covers and that xpdeletefile only deletes actual SQL Server file objects like backups and transaction logs or maintenance log files. It does so be reading the file header before deletingno match equals no delete.p  pWhat the Maintenance Cleanup Taskxpdeletefile does not purge are the SSIS SQL maintenance logs Ive created.  The xpdeletefile procedure apparently  does not have a file header that it recognizes. To purge these SSIS logs that Ive created Im using a DOS command called FORFILES to purge my SSIS SQL maintenance logsthis does actually work.p  pstrongMy question is this. Is there a way to generate the SQL Maintenance logs generated within SSIS like they are generated by SQL Server Studio so xpdeletefile will recognize those logs and delete themstrong p  pId rather have SSIS use the Maintenance Cleanup Task if possibleIm just curious if anyone has discovered this.  I already know how to do SSIS logging to log my packages. Microsoft doesnt seem to have an answer for this one on Connect, KB articles, etc, but I know that SQL Server Studio does use the SSIS engine under the coversso Id think their would be a way to duplicate that functionality in some way. All in all this feels more like a bug to me to have an SSIS Maintenance Cleanup Task not be able to clean up the maintenance files you just generated with another SSIS SQL Maintenance Taskbut it appears that Microsoft sees this more as a feature. p  pp.s. Im not overly enthusiastic about SSIS. Ive already designed TSQL maintenance plans that work very well and are easy to deploy. However, our company wants to try Microsofts Maintenance methodology on our VM servers in case the DBAs wont manage those boxesitd be easier, in theory, for nonDBAs to figure out.p

But If I want to have the slide leftright effect, so I set all content with codeposition absolutecode and move then by using jquery adding codetransform translatecode. But by this, the drawer wont extend at all, because all contentX dont occupy any space. Also codeposition absolutecode elements cant be hide with codeoverflowy hiddencodepli lipEach contentX has different size and its ajax request for data, so size is unknown. Therefore I cant have a fixed length drawer, I would rather let browser layout engine to allocate as much space as it need. But to doing so, I need contentX with codeposition staticcode, then I will have 3 contents stacking together vertically.pli ul

Negative 40852 pIm somewhat new to SQL but Im creating a database where theres one table of movie metadata, and I need to do full text searches on the movie scripts, which are currently organized into large tables, one for each movie, with columns for line number, timestamp, and a body of text which needs to be able to be searched for keywords, phrases. My question is whether my searches would run faster using one massive table for all of the scripts instead of one for each movie. Im using SQLite and Python.

Negative 40852 pThis question is about loading Javascript modules on the clientside. Two popular means of achieving this is by usingp  ol liRequirejs.li liNodes package management system to export and require files.li ol  pThe first option has always worked great for me. However, recently I noticed more and more people using the second option.p  pWhen I tried out the second option using a build tool browserify I noticed the files that were build contained a lot of redundant code like a wrapper around my own code. Now Im not sure if this is the best option, cause if all my javascript files were modified in such fashion the overall size of my project will increase and so will the load time. Is this something I should be worried about Are there any other differences between the two optionsp
Negative 40852 pI have an IOS app using azure storage blobs for jpg photos. My issue is when retrieving the blobs for display.p  pMost of the time they are retrieved fine. But just occasionally an odd one will not be returned. Instead 749 bytes are returned but with error still  nil.p  pNow that would be fine, no problem really.

Negative 40852 pIm a fairly new Gvim or Vimuser, and Im falling absolutely in love with it. Earlier Ive used Dreamweaver, whenever Im working on HTML og PHPfiles, since its easy to jump between files which NERDTree solved for me. But its especially easy in Dreamweaver to upload files to the remote server since its just pressing CTRLshiftU, whereafter Dreamweaver will attempt to upload it. Its by no means flawless, but it works 90 of the time, which is lovely. And NERDTree cant do this.p  pIve googled around, but without any luck. So I was just curious, what other Vim og Gvimusers does, when uploading files to a remote server Are they really alttabbing to a Filezillaprogram and uploading it through that It seems so clumsy. p  pAnd even though I fear that this topic will be closed when I ask this last addon question, then Ill still risk it In case that there isnt a good way to do it in Vim or Gvim.

Negative 40852 pIve got the following model for my projectp  precodepublic interface A Some methods  public interface B extends A Nothing  public interface C extends A  Nothig  public interface Immutable  Just info for the programmer public interface W extends Immutable Methods CollectionltAgt a W clone W modifyint amm W addA in, A[] out, String name  codepre  pAnd an implementation like thatp  precodepublic abstract class WAbs implements W public W clone    return modify0  public W addA in, A[] out, String name   assertoutnullampampA.lenghtgt0   out[0]in   return this   public class WImp1 extends WAbs private B b private C c Other Methods, icluding modify, that really returns a WImp1 CollectionltAgt a      CollectionltAgt out  new ArrayListltAgt2     out.addb     out.addc     return out  W addA in, A[] out, String name   assertoutnullampampout.lengthgt1   ifin instanceof B      WImp1 res  WImp1 clone      out[0]b      res.bB in      return res      else if in instanceof C      simular      return super.addin,out,name    codepre  pBut this seems  at least fo me  to be very smelly code. But i dont know how to clean up. WImp1 wants strongone or zerostrong instance of B strongandstrong CNot two Cs. I know i could migrate B and C as B and C doesnt contain Code to A, and add String modus to A. But then, the Compiler cannot help me, and i could store 2 Cs by accident. Even the JRE cannot check that for me at least i dont know how to implement an OCL statement like inv b.modus.equalsIgnoreCaseB in java properly. Removing codeb,ccode and make a codeA[] a  new A[2]code has the same problem.p  pI dont want to split addA in, A[] out, String name in addB b, A[] out, String name and addC c, A[] out, String name in W, because i want to be able to add another implementation, that asks for one B and one codeD extends Acode, and modify W because of that every time seems a bad idea, too.p  pIve tried to look up avoiding instancof Although im not sure if instanceof is my main problem, and found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2790144avoidinginstanceofinjavathisa. But It didnt help me a lot  maybe im just too stupid, to understand this questions and the answers there p  pI know this code does strange things, if you offer a codeclass Strange implements B,Ccode, but thats no real problem thats one point where codeString namecode comes into actionp  pA last question, just because im asking already Whats so smelly about instanceof and Casting Ive learned, that this is smelly, but i never really understood why this is always declared as bad layout. After the instanceof Operator i know, i can safely cast, if i want a special handler for a subclass of C, i can simply add it in front of my old ifelseif construct.p  pThanks for help, and sorry for my wall of text.

Negative 40852 pI have a customer that is requesting to integrate LDAP  AD login of Windows with a desktop .NET application. Its a desktop .NET application meaning its not a webpage which is publicly accessible its an executable with GUI that will run as a program not as service under Windows which is locally copied on the computer.p  pThe customer is requesting this as a measure of security. When you open the application you enter username and password and do an authentication check with LDAP. I dont really understand against what security risk this is supposed to protectp  ul liThe application is running under Windows so a Windows user must already be logged in  Whats the point of checking the credentials both on windows login and application loginli liThe only scenario I can think of is if someone leaves his computer unattended while he is logged in to Windows, in which case someone else can start the application however it doesnt prevent the scenario in which someone leaves his computer unattended while he is logged in to Windows and also logged in to the application. It doesnt make sense to invest time in protecting against one scenario and not the other, both are as likely to happen.li ul  pI have asked my contact with the customer, but his answer basically comes down to because its company policy so I dont think he really understands it either.

Negative 40852 pI opened our solution in Visual Studio 2015 yesterday and a few of our unit tests which ran fine in Visual Studio 2013 starting failing.

Yes, thats right, somehow that local lambda is being exposed as a type. If I comment out the code.Wherecode in VS2015 then I no longer get that second line.p  pIve used Beyond Compare to compare the two .csproj files but the only differences are the VS version number, the project GUID, names of the default namespace and assembly, and the VS2015 one had a reference to System.Net.Http that the VS2013 one didnt.p  pHas anyone else seen thisp  pDoes anyone have an explanation as to why a local variable would be being exposed as a type at the assembly levelp

Negative 40852 pI work on a system that is using SolarisCDE and have to manipulate the location of many windows manually hundreds of times a day.  Id like to automate this process via a shell or perl script. p  pIve done tons of research so far and found that most people can use wmctrl or xdotool to solve this problem.  I have no admin rights in order to install these packages.  I also lack a javac compiler. I do however have access to perl of which Im fairly fluent in or can write command line scripts.   p  pI dont need anything as fully featured as wmctrl or xdotool, I only need to move the windows.  Ive been able to get the details of my GUIs via xprop but am unsure on where to go from here.   Thanksp

Negative 40852 pFor this problem we are given a problem in LC3 and told to describe what it does and state what is contained in RESULT. Unfortunately, I am struggling hardcore with this language and I am really confused by it. I just dont understand what these different things are for. Here is the code.p  precode        .ORIG x3000         LD R2, ZERO         LD R0, M0         LD R1, M1 LOOP    BRz DONE         ADD R2, R2, R0         ADD R1, R1, 1         BR LOOP DONE    ST R2, RESULT HALT RESULT .FILL x0000 ZERO   .FILL x0000 MO     .FILL x0004 M1     .FILL x0803        .END codepre  pI dont even know where to begin. Like, what is .ORIG x3000 I think x3000 is a memory location If thats the case, then down at the bottom where it says .FILL ... arent those memory locations too Or are those numbers that you are filling into a register I am confused.p  pSo I THINK the second line loads whatever is in ZERO into register R2 Then M0 is loaded into R0, followed by M1 being loaded into R1 I am confused on what is being loaded. Are we loading values, or are we just placing memory addresses into registers After all the LD instructions, we come to a loop. I think the BRz means to go back up an reiterate through the loop as long as R1 is not 0 So, I guess R1 is our loop control element R2 is being added to whatever is in R0 and the result is being stored in R2. After the loop ends, then RESULT is stored into R2p  pWhat does DONE signal I thought if you wanted to exit a loop, you would instruct the computer to HALT which is the line right after it. So why have DONE followed by HALTp  pThe last few lines I assume are initializations Like, filling RESULT with x0000. What is x0000 Is it a memory location, or is a it a numberp  pCan someone help explain this to me and maybe guide me on what happens when this program is runp  pIm sorry if this is a lot at once. I am struggling big time and dont know where to even begin.p

Negative 40852 pI have an AngularJS app that makes a call to an API and returns a bunch of data that users can then filter by tags for greater granularity in the results. Each time a tag is clicked to filter the data, the app makes a new codehttp.getcode call, and the URL is modified with the appropriate query parameters so that the user can save the permalink and come back to any particular data set. p  pIm trying to give the app proper history handling with codewindow.history.pushStatecode, and passing the relevant query parameters for each history object as state data. Im using codewindow.onpopstatecode to detect when the backforward buttons are clicked, and using that to make the new codehttp.getcode call with the relevant state data from the history. p  pFor some reason, the codehttp.getcode function only fires on every emsecondem codepopstatecode, and then it makes two calls. Its almost as if theres some caching going on, but I havent been able to find the culprit. This behaviour persists in both directions, backwards and forwards, and is consistently every second event. Ive verified that codewindow.history.lengthcode is only incremented by 1 for every tag addedremoved, that the state data is being successfully sent, that new search queries are being correctly assembled, and that the request path is correct. Its just not firing. Whats going onp  pTo illustrate, the behaviour flow looks like this p  ul liLoad page at codedefaultcode  ul liAdd first tag URL is codedefaultamptagsacode, codehttp.getcode returns new datali liAdd second tag URL is codedefaultamptagsa,bcode, codehttp.getcode returns new datali liAdd third tag URL is codedefaultamptagsa,b,ccode, codehttp.getcode returns new datali liAdd fourth tag URL is codedefaultamptagsa,b,c,dcode, codehttp.getcode returns new datali ulli liFirst back button event  ul licodewindow.onpopstatecode fires, URL is now codedefaultamptagsa,b,ccodeli liNo network changesli ulli liSecond back button event  ul licodewindow.onpopstatecode fires, URL is now codedefaultamptagsa,bcodeli licodehttp.getcode fires, sends network request for data with codedefaultamptagsa,b,ccodeli licodehttp.getcode fires again, sends network request for data with codedefaultamptagsa,bcodeli lidataset for codedefaultamptagsa,bcode loadsli ulli liThird back button event  ul licodewindow.onpopstatecode fires, URL is now codedefaultamptagsacodeli liNo network changesli ulli liFourth back button event  ul licodewindow.onpopstatecode fires, URL is now codedefaultcodeli licodehttp.getcode fires, sends network request for data with codedefaultamptagsacodeli licodehttp.getcode fires again, sends network request for data with codedefaultcodeli lidataset for codedefaultcode loadsli ulli ul  pRelevant code snippet p  precodescope.apiRequest  functionoptions, callback        Omitted a bunch of functions to build query      based on userselected tags.

Negative 40852 pI have been tasked with creating a search function that when searched, certain fields will have more weight than others.p  pHere is an simplified example.p  pcars tablebr  year, make, model, color, type columnsp  pLets say someone searches for the followingp  pYear 1968br  Make Fordbr  Model Mustangbr  Color Redbr  Type Sports Carp  pIf the cars in the table have none of the correct fields they should not show up, but if record has some of the correct fields but not all they should still show up.

If anyone has done something like this please give me an idea of how to make it work.p  pI would like to do as much of the work in MySQL as possible via joins, I think this will be bring up the results faster than doing most of the work in PHP. But any solution to this problem would be much appreciated.p  pThanks in advancep
