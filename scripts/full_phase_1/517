Positive 517 pI am trying to learn TreeViewer in RCP. I wrote this small piece of code for that.p  precodepublic class TreeViewClass extends ViewPart   public static final String ID  TreeViewerDemo.treeView  public TreeViewClass       TODO Autogenerated constructor stub   Override public void createPartControlComposite parent       TreeViewer treeViewer  new TreeViewerparent, SWT.BORDER     Tree tree  treeViewer.getTree      TreeItem root  new TreeItemtree, 0     root.setTextRoot Node      TreeItem childNode1  new TreeItemroot, 0     childNode1.setTextChild Node 1      TreeItem childNode2  new TreeItemchildNode1, 0     childNode2.setTextChild Node 2   Override public void setFocus       TODO Autogenerated method stub     codepre  pWhen I am running this code, The tree gets displayed, but only the root node. When I click on the root nodewith a arrow icon, which means it has children, the node does not display the children nodes.  Later I discovered that, when I apply setExpandedtrue to a node, it gets displayed, otherwise, it doesnt.p  pWhere is the problem in my codep  pThanksp
Positive 517 pI need to show items in a 2level tree with virtualization especially on 2nd level. I want to show first level as vertical list and second level as wrap grid. Something like thisp  pCountry 1p  pCompany 1 Company 2p  pCompany 3p  pCountry 2p  pCompany 4 Company 5p  pCompany 6p  pWhat Ive found so far.p  ol lipListBox and telerikRadListBox support grouped CollectionViewSource but if i set codeScrollViewer.CanContentScrollTruecode which is required for scrolling to work properly virtualization is disabled.pli liptelerikRadTreeView supports virtualization but only if you use telerikTreeViewPanel which supports only Vertical orientation while I need Horizontal. Even if I use telerikVirtualizingWrapPanel virtualization is disabled. pli lipTreeView works only with VirtualizingStackPanel with Orientation set to Vertical. pli ol  pIve seen some implementations of VirtualizingWrapPanel but they dont work on 2nd level probably because TreeView measures 2nd level item with height equals to infinity.p  pBut 3. somehow works Are there any other working solutionsp

Positive 517 pIve been trying to just hide items from a TreeView. Im using a custom data type as source called SettingsMenuItem which inherits from FrameworkElement currently FrameworkContentElement, because otherwise the TreeView renders them wrong.p  pMy goal is by setting the codeVisibilityPropertycode of these FrameworkElements to either codeCollapsedcode or codeVisiblecode that Im able to hide certain items including their children. I know that this can be done by deleting items from the source collection. But thats not what I want. It would mean that I have to mirror each collection in order to keep track of its actual items, bind to each one in order to be notified about codeVisibilitycodechanges and create a new collection each time one changes. A lot of overhead for this.p  pRight now I have no clue how I could accomplish that. I figure its related to the ItemsGenerator, but I havent seen any possibility to override its behaviour. I thought TreeView would be able to detect Visibility, but obviously it doesnt. As alternative I thought of a custom TreeViewItem maybe even TreeView if necessary  but at this point the abstraction of this whole system overwhelms me. I dont know where to start and what is actually necessary to solve the problem.p  pTips what I have to change or implement by myself would be more than enough. A complete solution would be nice.p

Please helpp  pThanks p  pEdit My content provider for the tree viewer looks like thisp  precodepublic class ProjectContentProvider implements ITreeContentProvider  public Object[] getChildrenObject parentElement      return TreeStructure parentElement.getChildren.toArray   public Object getParentObject element      return TreeStructure element.getParent   public boolean hasChildrenObject element      return TreeStructure element.getChildren.size gt 0   public Object[] getElementsObject inputElement      return TreeStructure inputElement.getChildren.toArray   public void dispose    public void inputChangedViewer viewer, Object oldInput, Object newInput    codepre  pThanksp
Positive 517 pI am using codeTreeViewcode with codeShowCheckBoxesAllcode. What I want to achieve with below code is that when a user click on codeParent nodecode all the codechild nodescode get codeselectedcode.  p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comr0oX6.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comr0oX6.jpg altenter image description hereap  pThis code works only on first page load.

However, the context menus have a context.  Based on which is selected, the AddCommand may not be valid, and I want that represented as disabled and enabled in the view.p  pI put my tests for this condition in the CanExecute method of each command.  But at run time, CanExecute seems never to be invoked, and both menu item always appear disabled.p  pIs there a way to get this done  Is there a simple wayp  pThanks, Artp  pLATERp  pEditing my question appears to be the way to make a longer reply.

WeakEvent pattern is          not simple to implement, so why bother.         add           remove             public void Executeobject parameter              mDocumentViewModel.DeleteNode           public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged  endregion codepre  pI didnt do anything with the event stuff at the bottom, just copied it from an example.

Positive 517 pI need your opinion about UI and Databinding in WPF.p  pI had argue with my supervisor about UI amp databinding. There is A class, it has ObservableCollection of B class, and B class also has ObservableCollection of C class. These classes are used while communicating with NI CAN and LIN deviceit is not case.p  pOn the other hand, in user interface there are bunches of TreeView and DataGrids. There are several instances of A class which is used to store data from devices and files, and they are binded to Treeview and Datagrids. But, he disagrees with this, and says to make separate other list of variables for TreeView and Datagrid to data binding. As he says UI data and other must be separate and I agree with it. But, in this case there are several lists of lists of lists and for example copy from one list to other list when there is change on data takes much time and calculation   UI element . And other problems also.p  pI need your your opinion or other advice to come out better solution.p  pThank youp

Positive 517 pIm currently working on a dumb down version of iTunes in which tracks can be imported, modified, exported, etc. This is my first largescale programming project using any language. Ive structured the process of changing imported tracks in such a way that each time a track is modified its deleted from the Treeview Widget and the updated version is reinserted. So tracks are constantly getting new IDs which I make sure to keep updated throughout my entire program. My question, is this an okay way of updating information. Do you think this will lead to any performance issues And are there better more elegant ways of accomplishing the same goal How would I go about just editing the rows Right now I can edit them but the updated content doesnt reflect in the Treeview. self.tree.update doesnt seem to do anything either. Why is this Thanks     p  precodedef changegenre self, label     global currentGenre      change the current genre the user is working within     currentGenre  label     folder  None     self.status[text]  Now working in the     strcurrentGenre     genre channel     self.currentGenreDisplayString.setCurrent Genre   currentGenre      for directory, name in self.genreDict.items         if name  currentGenre             folder  directory             printdirectory      for i in importedTracks         trackInfo  self.tree.itemi          printtypetrackInfo[values][13]         trackInfo[values][13]  folder    trackInfo[values][13] codepre

Positive 517 pIm currently writing a data visualization application with Eclipse Scout Framework. It is based on the Scout Project Template Outline Tree and Table Form. What confuses me is the event handling in the Outline Tree. As you might know the different pagesnodes in the tree are automatically activatedcreated and displayed when clicking on the nodes without any custom implementation. I want to change this behaviour to the effect that a context menu opens when rightclicking on a node to delete it in a second step. For that reason Ive overwritten the execNodeClick method in the StandardOutline to look like thisp  precode Override   protected void execNodeClickITreeNode node, MouseButton mouseButton throws ProcessingException      if mouseButton  MouseButton.Right ampamp node instanceof ConnectionNodePage        ConnectionNodePage clickedConnectionNode  ConnectionNodePage node       logger.debugRight click on ConnectionNode   node       ListltAbstractMenugt menuList  new ArrayListltgt       menuList.addnew AbstractMenu          Override         protected String getConfiguredText             TODO Autogenerated method stub           return delete                  Override         protected void execAction throws ProcessingException            ServerConfigService serverConfigService  SERVICES.getServiceServerConfigService.class           serverConfigService.removeServerConnectionclickedConnectionNode.getConnection           StandardOutline.this.removeChildNodeStandardOutline.this.getRootNode, clickedConnectionNode                       clickedConnectionNode.setMenusmenuList         codepre  pI dont know whether this is the recommended way to dynamically add a context menu to a Tree Node, but It works somehow P However, there are serveral problems with this approach p  ol liFor some reason the nodes must be clickedactivated before next time clicking the context menus are opened. li liYou can see in the RAP client that empty context menus are also opened for pages that dont fulfill the condition node instanceof ConnectionNodePage, although loggingdebugging shows that condition works fine. My assumption is that the Scout engine finds the anonymous inner menu class and does something unpredictable with it. In the SWT client you dont see context menus for wrong pages.   li liI suspect my Event Handling to complicate with the Scout internal event handling. I dont really know what kind of event handling Scout does by default when rightclicking on treenodes, but it definately does something I dont want it to do. So Id like to disable any action on mouse rightclick except my custom implementation above. li ol  pI would appreciate someone to show me how this mechanism works and where I have to place the corresponding changes or at least a hint where I have to look. Thanks in advancep

Negative 517 pI need to write a web application using SQL Server 2005, asp.net, and ado.net.  Much of the user data stored in this application must be encrypted read HIPAA.p  pIn the past for projects that required encryption, I encrypteddecrypted in the application code.  However, this was generally for encrypting passwords or credit card information, so only a handful of columns in a couple tables.  For this application, far more columns in several tables need to be encrypted, so I suspect pushing the encryption responsibilities into the data layer will be better performing, especially given SQL Server 2005s native support for several encryption types.  I could be convinced otherwise if anyone has real, empirical evidence.p  pIve consulted BOL, and Im fairly adept at using google.  So I dont want links to online articles or MSDN documentation its likely Ive already read it.p  pOne approach Ive wrapped my head around so far is to use a symmetric key which is opened using a certificate.p  pSo the one time setup steps are performed by a DBA in theoryp  ol liCreate a Master Key li liBackup the Master Key to a file, burn to CD and store off site.li liOpen the Master Key and create a certificate.li liBackup the certificate to a file, burn to CD and store off site.li liCreate the Symmetric key with encryption algorithm of choice using the certificate.li ol  pThen anytime a stored procedure or a human user via Management Studio needs to access encrypted data you have to first open the symmetric key, execute any tsql statements or batches, and then close the symmetric key.p  pThen as far as the asp.net application is concerned, and in my case the application codes data access layer, the data encryption is entirely transparent.p  pSo my questions arep  ol lipDo I want to open, execute tsql statementsbatches, and then close the symmetric key all within the sproc  The danger I see is, what if something goes wrong with the tsql execution, and code sproc execution never reaches the statement that closes the key.  I assume this means the key will remain open until sql kills the SPID that sproc executed on.pli lipShould I instead consider making three database calls for any given procedure I need to execute only when encryption is necessary  One database call to open the key, a second call to execute the sproc, and a third call to close the key.  Each call wrapped in its own try catch loop in order to maximize the odds that an open key ultimately is closed.pli lipAny considerations should I need to use client side transactions meaning my code is the client, and initiates a transaction, executes several sprocs, and then commits the transaction assuming successpli ol

This is the wall time clock.pli lipstrongCLOCKMONOTONICstrong  No idea what this is and what SI seconds mean, but I understand that this clock will never jump backwards, it can only monotonically increase in value.pli lipstrongCLOCKUPTIMEstrong  I fail to see how this is different to CLOCKMONOTONIC uptime also never jumps backwards, but at least I know that this clock starts at zero when the kernel boots whereas its not defined what initial value CLOCKMONOTONIC will have when the kernel bootspli ul  pLets ignore the other clocks for a second. CLOCKREALTIME is not guaranteed to monotonically count upwards, right This is the actual system time. I can alter the system time at will. I can set it 3 month into the past or 5 years into the future and each time my system syncs time using a NTP server on the net, the time might jump forward or backward.p  pNow we have two sleeping functions in a BSD system. a hrefhttpwww.rocketaware.commanman3sleep.3.htm relnofollowsleepa and a hrefhttpwww.rocketaware.commanman2nanosleep.2.htm relnofollownanosleepa. Im not sure, but I would expect sleep to be implemented on top of nanosleep, after all I can easily emulate sleep by using nanosleep and only set the number of seconds in the struct timespec, keeping nanoseconds zero.p  pI have read at many sources, that these functions actually work by calculating the wakeup time get current time, add sleep amount to it and the system will then check in regular interval if the current time is emlaterem than the wakeup time and if so, it will wake up the thread again. The fact that this is only checked in intervals is the reason why the man pages say that the current sleep will sleep for at least this amount of time shorter only if interrupted by a signal, but it may sleep longer depending on how often the system checks if we are already past the wakeup time and depending on how long it takes before the scheduler allows this thread to run again.p  pThis is all perfectly sane to me... but there is one question that always bugged mep  pAccording to various sources the sleeps at least the nanosleep use CLOCKREALTIME as clock internally. This means, if tell nanosleep to sleep for 30 seconds, then change my system clock to 1 hour in the future, the thread will wake up almost immediately 1 hour in the future is way ahead of the wakeup time nanosleep calculated. This is also perfectly okay. strongHoweverstrong what happens if I say wake up in 30 seconds and then the user finds out that his system clock is one hour ahead and sets his clock backwards by one hour Then my thread will sleep for 1 hour and 30 seconds As that would be rather bad.p

When they submit a request, they get an email verification that it was submitted.  The recipient address of this email verification is collected usingp  precodeMembership.GetUser.Email codepre  pSo far this all seems fairly elementary and has worked without a hitch.  However, I just receieved a few calls from our users of people who filled out the request and got the email, but the request could not be found in the system.  I had them forward me the confirmation emails so I could view the recipient address and find the user in the ASP.NET Membership tables.  However, I could not find the user based on the email, and I could find no trace of the Request in the database when I was given details on what they entered.p  pI have provided no method for users to delete their accounts or delete a request.  There is no method to change an email address or edit pertinent data.  The database is pretty locked down, with all queries being run through Stored Procedures.p  pNow, my question is, how in the heck is this possible  The user needs to be authenticated to fill out the request, and I have the confirmation email with the email address which I cant find in the system.  The email address is gathered using the the method mentioned above, which to me proves that this user had to exist in the database with the specified email address at one time.p  pI really have no clue where to proceed from here.  Does anybody have an ideas on what to check  I would appreciate any advice as I am stumped, and I can provide any additional info if needed.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 517 pIm working on a kind of a HMI application and is creating objects to define a specific machine. Lets say this is a car for the sake of argument.p  pA object for the engine is obvious.

The throttle property is a input of course. p  pThe car has atleast one door. Each door can have a window, it can be openable and it may be electrically operated. If its electrically operated it will depend on power from the car to operate. p  pNow, should I expose the door as a property on the car object, or would it be most sensible to keep it private and having the car object operate the door in OpenDoor and RollDownWindow functions What about events Should I expose events on the engine, example LowOnOil event, or should I deal with it in the car object witch in turn could have an event like EngineIsLowOnOilp  pHow would you do thisp

So I thought it would be a good idea to implement a menu item which allows to send the logcat output to a email address, so that we can examine the log.p  pUnfortunately I didnt find a hint in the Internet how to extract the logcat from a phone. How to send an email shouldnt be the problem.p

Negative 517 pIm having a strange problem with a colour animation.p  pI have a list of items bound to a listbox.

I got a similar result as above.p  pAlso tried changing the FillBehaviour property, but setting it to stop meant that the color would revert to the original colour as soon as the animation had completed as expected.p  pI thought that the animation would animate from the current colour either from the datatemplate or from the current animation if one exists, and would animate to the new colour.  I cant quite suss out why I seem to get a colour inbetween the original and new colour.  Is this a known problem with the colour animation or is it a problem with my triggersp  pThanks allp

I removed one of the styles from the common dictionaries and placed them in each theme dictionary, giving each copy a distinct look, like thisp  precodelt RedTheme.xaml gt ltResourceDictionary xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation                      xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml                     mcIgnorabled                     xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006                      xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008gt   ltStyle xKeyHeaderContentStyle TargetTypeContentControlgt     ltSetter PropertyTemplategt       ltSetter.Valuegt         ltControlTemplate TargetTypeContentControlgt           ltGrid Margin0 BackgroundRedgt             ltContentPresenter ContentTemplateBinding Contentgt           ltGridgt         ltControlTemplategt       ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt   ltStylegt ltResourceDictionarygt   lt BlueTheme.xaml gt ltResourceDictionary xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation                      xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml                     mcIgnorabled                     xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006                      xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008gt   ltStyle xKeyHeaderContentStyle TargetTypeContentControlgt     ltSetter PropertyTemplategt       ltSetter.Valuegt         ltControlTemplate TargetTypeContentControlgt           ltGrid Margin0 BackgroundBluegt             ltContentPresenter ContentTemplateBinding Contentgt           ltGridgt         ltControlTemplategt       ltSetter.Valuegt     ltSettergt   ltStylegt ltResourceDictionarygt codepre  pThen, I added code to dynamically load one of the resource dictionaries from XAML and insert it into the applications merged dictionariesp  precode In App.xaml.cs var themeUri  new Uri     OurAppcomponentThemesRedTheme.xaml, UriKind.Relative var resourceInfo  GetResourceStreamthemeUri using var stream  resourceInfo.Stream      using var reader  new StreamReaderstream              var xamlText  reader.ReadToEnd         var dict  XamlReader.LoadxamlText as ResourceDictionary         Resources.MergedDictionaries.Adddict       codepre  pThis worked to some extent.  If I loaded the theme during startup, that themes style was displayed.  However, what didnt work was trying to switch to the other theme after startup.  Adding the other theme theme dictionary to the merged dictionaries didnt cause the UI to be modified.  Neither did clearing out the old theme dictionary and adding the new one.  Neither did doing any of these followed by removing the root visual and readding it.p  h2Approach 2h2  pAfter that, I tried using the Silverlight Toolkit pattern of theming.  This didnt work, I assume, because it is meant to switch out emimplicitem styles rather than emexplicitem ones.  I created my Themederived class, set its resource dictionary URI, and added that theme to a root visual codeContentControlcode.  Then, however, when I created my main UI class, the explicit style referenced by the UI couldnt be found, so a runtime exception occurred.  p  pSo then I tried loading one of the theme resource dictionaries into the applications merged dictionaries.  This allowed the main UI class to be created and placed inside of the codeStylecode object.  However, the explicit styles inside of the codeStylecodes resource dictionary failed to override the styles defined inside of the applications merged dictionaries.  Therefore, nothing appeared to change.p  h2Current Approachh2  pSo now Im considering a third approach.  It will involve an attached property used something like this codeTheming.StyleStyleNamecode.  Then, elsewhere in the application, an association between theme names and style name overrides will be maintained.  Whenever the theme changes, the right styles for the theme will be applied.p  h2Dilemmah2  pId rather not reinvent a wheel if theres already one out there.  Is there already something built into Silverlight that allows for switching themes containing explicit styles  Are there any thirdparty libraries that would let me do what I wantp

Negative 517 pI was wondering what would be the best configuration of view controllers and views for an app that Ive been planning out. Conceptually, the way I would like to lay out the app is with an initial loaderbrowser view, likely with document thumbnails. When a user chooses to open one, a new view comes up that forms the main documentediting mode. The user can also choose to bring up a third view that contains an alternative documentediting mode.p  pI suppose this is very much like the way the Pages for iPad works, with first a row of document thumbnails to choose from, then the main word processing view, and accessible from a popover a third page setup view. Document browser view, and two document editing views.p  pNow, I can think of, and have been playing around with a few different setups, but in each case I can see problems that Ill be running into later. So really, Im looking for advice on a configuration that you think would keep things as neat and manageable as possible.p  pI hope this is not too open a question, and I would very much appreciate any answer.p  pThank you,p

Negative 517 pGood morning,p  pI wrote part of a program that does some heavy work with strings in C.

I am using a radial gradient ... so the results are far from what I want, since the car is not an oval.p  pemHere is a picture of the result.emignore the random yellow dotted oval img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comALzj9.png altGradientFill radial used as Bitmap maskp  precodepackage code import flash.display.Sprite import flash.display.Bitmap import flash.display.BitmapData import flash.events.Event import flash.events.MouseEvent import flash.display.Graphics import fl.controls.Button import code.CropDot import flash.display.MovieClip import flash.display.GradientType import flash.display.SpreadMethod import flash.geom.Matrix import flash.display.Shape  import fl.controls.RadioButton  public class BitmapEdit extends Sprite      public var maskeeMovieClip     public var bitmapBitmap     public var dotsSprite     public var fillMovieClip     public var numDotsint     public var circShape  new Shape               public var matMatrixnew Matrix     public var circRadNumber50      public var offsetXint     public var offsetYint      public function BitmapEditbmpBitmap         tracebitmapedit          MASK Stuff                  bitmap  new Bitmapbmp.bitmapData         maskee  new MovieClip         maskee.addChildbitmap          fill  new MovieClip         this.addChildmaskee         this.addChildfill         maskee.mask  fill         maskee.cacheAsBitmap  true         fill.cacheAsBitmap  true           DOTS DOTS DOTS                  dots  new Sprite          numDots  12         offsetX  90         offsetY  90         cX  dot0.xoffsetX         cY  dot0.yoffsetY         rangeX  [cX,cX]         rangeY  [cY,cY]         forvar iint0iltnumDotsi             this[doti.toString].x  offsetX             this[doti.toString].y  offsetY             this[doti.toString].name  doti.toString             dots.addChildthis[doti.toString]             cXdotX             cYdotY             ifdotXltrangeX[0]                 rangeX[0]dotX             else ifdotXgtrangeX[1]                 rangeX[1]dotX             ifdotYltrangeY[0]                 rangeY[0]dotY             else ifdotYgtrangeY[1]                 rangeY[1]dotY                  cdot.x  cX         cdot.y  cY         this.addChilddots          fill.graphics.lineStyle3,0,1.0,true          this.addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, enterFrameHandler           public var cXNumber     public var cYNumber     public var dotXNumber     public var dotYNumber     public var prevdotXNumber     public var prevdotYNumber     public var rangeXArray     public var rangeYArray      protected function enterFrameHandlereEvent          draw lines between dots         this.setChildIndexfill,this.numChildren2         this.setChildIndexdots,this.numChildren1         fill.graphics.clear          Draw Fill         var fW  rangeX[1]rangeX[0]         var fH  rangeY[1]rangeY[0]         mat.createGradientBoxfW, fH, 0, cXfW2, cYfH2         fill.graphics.beginFill0,1         fill.graphics.beginBitmapFillbitmap.bitmapData         mat  new Matrix         fill.graphics.beginFill0,1         fill.graphics.beginGradientFillGradientType.RADIAL,[0x000000, 0x000000], [1, 0], [123,255], mat, SpreadMethod.PAD, rgb, 0          fill.graphics.moveTodot0.x, dot0.y         cX  dot0.x         cY  dot0.y         prevdotX  dot0.x          prevdotY  dot0.y         rangeX  [cX,cX]         rangeY  [cY,cY]         forvar iint1 iltnumDots i             dotX  this[doti.toString].x             dotY  this[doti.toString].y             fill.graphics.lineTo dotX, dotY             cXdotX             cYdotY             ifdotXltrangeX[0]                 rangeX[0]dotX             else ifdotXgtrangeX[1]                 rangeX[1]dotX             ifdotYltrangeY[0]                 rangeY[0]dotY             else ifdotYgtrangeY[1]                 rangeY[1]dotY                  cXnumDots         cYnumDots         tracectrcX,cY         cdot.x  cX         cdot.y  cY         fill.graphics.lineTodot0.x,dot0.y                      EndFill         fill.graphics.endFill            function toRadaNumberNumber          return aMath.PI180        codepre  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  p1 How can I fade just the edges of this customshaped fill outlined by the red dotsp  p2 I want to save the image out to a file once its cropped.

Negative 517 pI am using Perl to load some macro files.

Negative 517 pBasically, I want to automatically register object creator functions with an object factory for a bunch of classes defined across many header files.p  pThe top answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1310214registeranobjectcreatorinobjectfactorythis posta, provides a solution  but it doesnt fit my constraints.p  pIm working on an existing code base.  For the classes I need to register, there is already a macro following the class declarations that takes the class as a parameter.  If I were able to extend the existing macro definition to also do registration, then it would save a lot time because no existing code would have to be changed.p  pThe closest solution Ive been able to come up with is creating a macro that defines a template specialization of a method that registers that object, then calls the previously defined template specialization method  thus chaining all the register calls.  Then, when I want to register all classes, I just call the most recently defined specialization and it registers everything in reverse order of include appearance.p  pBelow, Ive posted a simple working example that shows my solution thus far.p  pThe only caveat is that I have no way of automatically keeping track of the last registered type to call in the chain.  So I keep redefining the define LASTCHAINLINK to be the most recently specialized typename.  This means that Id have to add two lines of undefdefine after every existing macro call  Id really like to avoid that.p  pThe main question In the code below, is there any way to define the REGISTERCHAIN macro to work without using the LASTCHAINLINK undefdefine code toop  pIf only it were possible to redefine the LASTCHAINLINK token inside the REGISTERCHAIN method...p  pMy guess is some solution is possible using the codeCOUNTERcode preprocessor feature, but that is not available on one of the target platforms OS X using gcc 4.2.x and thus not an option.p  pSimplified example compiles on GNU C 4.4.3p  precodeinclude ltmapgt include ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt  struct Object virtual Object    base type for all objects   provide a simple create function to derived classes templateltclass Tgt struct ObjectT  public Object    static Object create  return new T    struct ObjectFactory     pass in creator function pointer to register it to id   static Object createconst stdstringamp id, Object creator  0      static stdmapltstdstring, Object gt creators     return creator ampamp creators[id]  creator  0  creators.findid  creators.end  creators.findidgtsecond  0      templateltclass T  intgt struct Register  static void chain      define LASTCHAINLINK  empty to start  define REGISTERCHAINT                                  templateltgt void ObjectFactoryRegisterltTgtchain                                                                ObjectFactorycreateT, Tcreate                    stdcout ltlt Registerlt ltlt T ltlt gtchainn        ObjectFactoryRegisterltLASTCHAINLINKgtchain       struct DerivedA  public ObjectTltDerivedAgt  DerivedA  stdcout ltlt DerivedA constructorn   REGISTERCHAINDerivedA  Can these next two lines be eliminated or folded into REGISTERCHAIN undef LASTCHAINLINK define LASTCHAINLINK DerivedA  struct DerivedB  public ObjectTltDerivedBgt  DerivedB  stdcout ltlt DerivedB constructorn   REGISTERCHAINDerivedB  Can these next two lines be eliminated or folded into REGISTERCHAIN undef LASTCHAINLINK define LASTCHAINLINK DerivedB  struct DerivedC  public ObjectTltDerivedCgt  DerivedC  stdcout ltlt DerivedC constructorn   REGISTERCHAINDerivedC  Can these next two lines be eliminated or folded into REGISTERCHAIN undef LASTCHAINLINK define LASTCHAINLINK DerivedC  struct DerivedD  public ObjectTltDerivedDgt  DerivedD  stdcout ltlt DerivedD constructorn   REGISTERCHAINDerivedD  Can these next two lines be eliminated or folded into REGISTERCHAIN undef LASTCHAINLINK define LASTCHAINLINK DerivedD  int mainvoid     Call last link in the register chain to register all object creators   ObjectFactoryRegisterltLASTCHAINLINKgtchain   delete ObjectFactorycreateDerivedA   delete ObjectFactorycreateDerivedB   delete ObjectFactorycreateDerivedC   delete ObjectFactorycreateDerivedD   return 0  codepre  pexample outputp  precodegt g example.cpp ampamp .a.out RegisterltDerivedDgtchain RegisterltDerivedCgtchain RegisterltDerivedBgtchain RegisterltDerivedAgtchain DerivedA constructor DerivedB constructor DerivedC constructor DerivedD constructor codepre

If I dont attempt to manually reauthenticate with game center, then the achievements view doesnt display anything. If I do reauthenticate when the game is foregrounded, then I either get a crash when bringing up the achievements view happens on device or the achievements view still shows the stats from the previous player simulator. As an additional note, iOS 4.2 seems to be fine since the user is reauthenticated automatically when the game is foregrounded.p  pThe official documentation says Automatically authenticating the local player after moving to the foreground is provided only on iOS 4.2 and later. On iOS 4.1, there is no correct way to authenticate the local player after your application moves to the background.

Negative 517 pI am guessing that this maybe a silly beginner question, but I cant figure out the answer to it. I basically have two view controllers in my iphone app that I would like them to share a third class .m and .h that suppose to hold data that both suppose to use. Lets say for example that both views are displaying locations and presenting a table with some of this information manipulated  what id like to do is to have a third class, like an engine, that will do all that, and those views will just instantiate this engine and read the tablelocation data when needed. p  pMy question is  how can I instantiate this engine in both my views but have in fact only one copy of the engine that both views read from. I know that when instantiating twice, two copies are being created, and i dont want that. i am hoping to make this engine global.p  pis this possible at all in objective c what would be the best way to go about thatp  pThank you much all. p
Negative 517 pIm doing a spot of research surrounding Entity Framework and its associated .edmx files.p  pOur current setup has a number of these files compiled in to a library that we use extensively. Of course, this isnt exaclty an elegant solution  every time we want to update or add to something in the database layer, we need to recompile this library. p  pWe use stored procedures exclusively, and our current approach is to use the codeExecuteFunctioncode method on the object context. However, this does require knowledge of what imported functions from an edmx file return what type codecontext.ExecutionFunctionltTgtcode returns codeObjectResultltTgtcode.p  pMy theoretical solution is to store any .edmx files we want to use at a relative path, and have the library load them all at run time. p  pHas anybody tried this before Does it work Are there any performance considerations to take in to account This would be used in an ecommerce environment, so efficiency and speed is important.p  pstrongEDIT FOR SOME MORE CLARITYstrongp  pIt would certainly be possible to compile each individual .edmx file in to its own assembly, which might allow the use of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb495513.aspx relnofollowthisa. Any input on that, too, would be great.p  pThe call we make now is something like thisp  precodeDatabase.MakeCallltTgtstoredprocedurename, parametersCollection, KnownDatabases.Database codepre  pIn its constructor, the database handler will hold instances of each of the database contexts it knows about each of the.edmx files in the library . Using the codeKnownDatabasescode enum, it chooses which database to run the query against.p  pIdeally, Id like to achieve a call like thisp  precodeDatabase.MakeCallltTgtcontextname, storedprocedurename, parametersCollection codepre  pWhere in the database handler will, in its constructor, search a folder for .edmx files and load them all, then store instances of each context against the context name. How codeTcode would be defined or obtained is a little blurry right now.p  pIn both cases, the return type would be codeObjectResultltTgtcodep

Negative 517 pIs there an extensible, efficient way to write existential statements in Haskell without implementing an embedded logic programming language Oftentimes when Im implementing algorithms, I want to express existentially quantified firstorder statements likep  precodex.y.x,y  xs  x  y  p x y codepre  pwhere codecode is overloaded on lists. If Im in a hurry, I might write perspicuous code that looks likep  precodefind p []      False find p xxs  any y gt x  y ampamp p x y  p y x xs  find p xs codepre  porp  precodefind p xs  or [ x  y ampamp p x y  p y x  x lt xs, y lt xs] codepre  pBut this approach doesnt generalize well to queries returning values or predicates or functions of multiple arities. For instance, even a simple statement likep  precodex.y.x,y,z  xs  x  y  z  f x y z  g x y z codepre  prequires writing another search procedure. And this means a considerable amount of boilerplate code. Of course, languages like codeCurrycode or codePrologcode that implement narrowing or a resolution engine allow the programmer to write statements likep  precodefindp,xs,z  x  xs amp y  xs amp x  y amp f x y  g x y  z codepre  pto abuse the notation considerably, which performs both a search and returns a value. This problem arises often when implementing formally specified algorithms, and is often solved by combinations of functions like codefmapcode, codefoldrcode, and codemapAccumcode, but mostly explicit recursion. Is there a more general and efficient, or just general and expressive, way to write code like this in Haskellp

Negative 517 pI am working on an Excel 2010 template project. In my template I have many sheets with static codeListObjectcode controls in each of them. To initialize my codeListObjectcode, I bind a codeBindingListltMyCustomTypegtcode so it generates a column for each of my codeMyCustomTypecode public properties. It is really handy because when the user some rows in the codeListObjectcode, it automatically fills up my codeBindingListcode instance. I added a button in the Excel ribbon so that the program can validate and commit these rows through an EDM. This is how I bind my data to the ListObject in the startup event handler of one of my Excel sheet.p  precodepublic partial class MyCustomTypesSheet      private BindingListltMyCustomTypegt myCustomTypes      private void OnStartupobject sender, System.EventArgs e              ExcelTools.ListObject myCustomTypeTable  this.MyCustomTypeData         BindingListltMyCustomTypegt customTypes  new BindingListltMyCustomTypegt          myCustomTypeTable.SetDataBindingcustomTypes            Implementation detail...  codepre  pNow my issue is that it is very likely that the user of this template will enter these rows in many sessions. It means that he will enter data, save the file, close it, reopen it, enter some new rows and eventually try to commit these rows when he thinks he is done. What I noticed is that when the Excel file created from the template is reopened, the DataSource property of my ListObject controls is null. Which means I have no way to get back the data from the codeListObjectcode into a codeBindingListltMyCustomTypegtcode. I have been searching and I found no automatic way to do that and I dont really want to make a piece of code that would crawl through all of the columns to recreate my codeMyCustomTypecode instances. In an ideal world I would have done like this.p  precodeprivate void OnStartupobject sender, System.EventArgs e      ExcelTools.ListObject myCustomTypeTable  this.MyCustomTypeData     BindingListltMyCustomTypegt customTypes  null      if myCustomTypeTable.DataSource  null  Will always be null and erase previous data.              customTypes  new BindingListltMyCustomTypegt         myCustomTypeTable.SetDataBindingcustomTypes          else              customTypes  myCustomTypeTable.DataSource as BindingListltMyCustomTypegt       codepre  pI have been doing a lot of research on this but I was not able to find a solution so I hope some of your can help me to resolve this issue.p  pThanks.p

Negative 517 pIm currently trying to develop a simple notepad in Java. However, Im struggling with a correct handling of event listeners. I stick to the Single Responsibility Principle while programming. Unfortunately, the current way of handling the event listeners certainly breaks the principle. p  pEvery time I create a new menu button, I have to implement the ActionListener and override the actionPerformed method and pass it as an argument of the addActionListener method. As a result, the entire code is becoming more and more complicated, and breaks the Single Responsibility Principle because the event listeners are not separated from the UI.p  pThe problem becomes more serious when there are lots of components to handle.

I have even been able to step into the set function, write down the memory address, then move to this function, let it get 0xfdfdfdfd, and then manually get the memory address in the debugger.  This causes the code to work.  Now, from what Ive read, 0xfdfdfdfd means guarding bytes or no mans land, but I dont really understand what the implications of that are.  Supposedly it also means an off by one error, but I dont understand how that could happen, if the code was working before.p

I am using fixed point data type recursion to represent abstract syntax trees ast.p  pI am investigating how to write the type checker for a toy language having simple expressions numeric and logic constants, binary operations and local variable declarations.p  pThe type checker is a readwritestate codeRWScode monadp  ul lireader because it uses a context consisting of an environment with symbol definitions an association list of a symbol and its typeli liwriter because it generates a list of error messagesli listate will be needed later for implementing nominal type equivalence, and by now I am just counting how many variables are defined in the program just as a demonstration of its use.li ul  pThe value returned by the monad is an ast annotated with types for expressions or environments for declarations.p  pThe function codecheckercode receives an ast of the input program and results in a new ast annotated with codeRWScode monad actions that, when run, gives the type if the ast is an expression or the environment if the ast is a declaration.p  pFor instance, consider the input programp  precodelet x  2  3 in 1  x codepre  pwith the corresponding astp  precode                    Let                                                                                                                                        VarDec x               Bin Add                                                                                                                                    Bin Add          Num 1.0     Var x                                                                                                                              Num 2.0    Num 3.0 codepre  pType checking it will produce the following astp  precode                  action1                     Let                                                                                                                                         action2                action3      VarDec x               Bin Add                                                                                                                                    action4          action5    action6       Bin Add          Num 1.0     Var x                                                                                                                    action7    action8       Num 2.0    Num 3.0 codepre  pwhich is recursively annotated with codeRWScode monad actions.p  pLater phases of the compiler will need to know the information produced by the annotations in the ast and its children, recursively. Therefore it will be needed to run the corresponding action to get it.p  pA root action is constructed by composing the actions of the children, according to the rules of the language.p  pFor instance, in order to get the type of the root expression a let expression, codeaction1code has to be run, and that will make codeaction2code and codeaction3code to be run as well, because when codeaction1code was created, it used codeaction2code and codeaction3code.p  pWhen the type of the addition code1xcode is needed, codeaction3code has to be run in order to get it.p  pSo actions will be run repeatedly. The way the type checker is structured using codeRWScode monad actions loses sharing of the computed information for each node of the ast.p  pIs there any technique to recover this sharing, eliminating the need of recomputing actionsp

Negative 517 pNote I had another similar question about how to GZIP data using Rubys codezlibcode which emtechnicallyem was answered and I didnt feel I could start evolving the question since it had been answered so although this question is related it is not the same...p  pThe following code I believe is GZIPing a static CSS file and storing the results in the coderesultcode variable. But what do I do with this in the sense how can I send this data back to the browser so it is recognised as being GZIPed rather than the original file size e.g. when checking my YSlow score I want to see it correctly marking me for making sure I GZIP static resources.p  precodez  ZlibDeflate.new6, 31 z.deflateFile.readpublicAssetsStylesbuild.css z.flush result  z.finish  could also of done result  z.deflatefile, ZlibFINISH  z.close codepre  p...one thing to note is that in my previous question the respondent clarified that codeZlibDeflate.deflatecode will not produce gzipencoded data. It will only produce zlibencoded data and so I would need to use codeZlibDeflate.newcode with the codewindowBitscode argument equal to 31 to start a gzip stream.p  pBut when I run this code I dont actually know what to do with the coderesultcode variable and its content. There is no information on the internet that I can find about how to send GZIP encoded static resources like JavaScript, CSS, HTML etc to the browser, this making the page load quicker. It seems every Ruby article I read is based on someone using Ruby on Railsp  pAny help really appreciated.p

Now its done in onCreate  method. But its not right, because, for example I run app, enter pass, clicked Okbutton and dialog closed.

I used the tutorial in cookbook a hrefhttpbook.cakephp.org2.0encorelibrariescomponentsauthentication.html relnofollowhttpbook.cakephp.org2.0encorelibrariescomponentsauthentication.htmla  The users table is linked to the groups table.br All the users in my users table perform different roles basing on the groups they belong to and they use the same view for log in. I need to add another user called buyer who is not in any way related to these other users. The buyers should have their own login which is different from the users.  I have come across many questions with answers about different login but they are not really what i need. I also do not intend to change my schema.  My questions 1. Is it possible to use two controllers in this case the buyers and users controller for my aunthentication 2. How can buyers log in with an email and password that is in the buyers table and for the application to authenticate them 3. How do i add these buyers to my application without adding a new group for them Thank you.p
Negative 517 pI am trying to make sense of Observer design pattern as the main event dispatching DP. To me, observer DP is just a subset of pubsub DP. These are the points I could list as the main differences between the twop  ul liIn observer DP, there is not much of message passing going on. Observers wait for a certain event to be triggered and the moment that event is triggered, the observer is notified. Pubsub, on the other hand, relies heavily on message passing.li liIn observer DP, the observers know in advance what to expect upon notification received as opposed to pubsub DP where anything could be published by publisher as a message somehow another difference between event and message.li liObserver is implemented between the boundaries of an application. Pubsub is more cross app communication pattern.li liAn last but not least, in pubsub DP, there is a publisher, broker, and subscriber.

Negative 517 p Hi Im trying to implement an alphabeta search, but i first want to understand all the logic behind it, not just implementing it using some kind of pseudo code. p  p What i understand is this A white player makes a movelets call it move1. The first move is saved as alpha the minimum value the player is assured of. Now, if we move to the next possible move by whitemove2, and see that the black players first response results a valuation that is worse than alpha, we can skip all possible blacks counter moves as we already know that when white makes move2, the worst possible result is worse than move1s worst possible result.p  pBut, what i dont understand is that beta variable. From chess programming wiki i read   the maximum score the minimizing player is assured of . But i cant really get the idea behind it.p  pCan somebody please explain it in very simple terms Thank you very much.p

A cancel button would also be nice at a later stage.p  pIve implemented this using Rx, like sop  precode Get a list of all the files var enumeratedFiles  Directory.EnumerateFilestargetDirectory, ., SearchOption.AllDirectories   prepare the progress bar             double value  0             progBar.Minimum  0             progBar.Maximum  enumeratedFiles.Count             progBar.Value  value             progBar.Height  15             progBar.Width  100             statusBar.Items.AddprogBar  var files  enumeratedFiles.ToObservable                 .SubscribeOnTaskPoolScheduler.Default                 .ObserveOnDispatcher                 .Subscribex gt                                              myDataSet.myTable.AddTableRowSystem.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtensionx                         value                     ,                      gt                                              myDataSetTableAdapter.UpdatemyDataSet.myTable                         myDataSetTableAdapter.FillmyDataSet.myTable                         statusBar.Items.RemoveprogBar                      codepre  pHowever, with the above example the UI is locked and the progress bar doesnt update during the process. I assume thats because the AddTableRow method is blocking the thread, although I believed that the SubscribeOnTaskPoolScheduler was supposed to run the task on a new threadp  pIve tried a few different approaches as well, with varying results. For example adding a .Do linep  precodevar files  enumeratedFiles.ToObservable                 .Dox gt myDataSet.myTable.AddTableRowSystem.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtensionx                 .SubscribeOnTaskPoolScheduler.Default                 .ObserveOnDispatcher                 .Subscribex gt                                              value                     ,                      gt                                              myDataSetTableAdapter.UpdatemyDataSet.myTable                         myDataSetTableAdapter.FillmyDataSet.myTable                         statusBar.Items.RemoveprogBar                         btnCancel.Visibility  Visibility.Collapsed                      codepre  pthis actually shows the progress bar updates, and the UI is not completely locked but it is choppy and the performance crawls down...p  pIve tried using a BackgroundWorker to do the same job, but the performance is way worse than the Rx approach above for example, for 21000 files the Rx approach takes a few seconds while the BackgroundWorker a few minutes to finish.p  pIve also seen similar problems being tackled with Delegates for the progress bars ValueProperty method, but I would really like to solve this using Rx if possible.p  pAm I missing something obvious here Any suggestion would be highly appreciated...p

Negative 517 pSo, I am working on a PHP scheduler for seminars.  Basically I have a list of seminars that each meet once per week at the same time on the same day, and run a set number of weeks.p  pRight now in my database I have the pkey, the start date, the end date, the name of the seminar, and a string representing the day and time.p  pRight now I have a page showing all seminars currently running based on comparing todays date to the start and end dates of all seminars.  Now I want it JUST to show seminars meeting today.p  pI assume I will need to make the schedule variable a DATE.  The varchar string was a dect tape fix because I do not even know where to start with this part.p  pHow do I format the SQL variable to store the day and time in a DATE type variable that is in the format [weekday] [time]  Is this possiblep  pEDITp  pCan somebody who understands what I am asking help me reword my question  It seems like I can not make what I am asking clear.p  pFor example lets say there are MySQL seminars are Wednesdays at 7pm starting 1114 and ending 1226.  I have Wednesdays 7pm saved as a VARCHAR string, and StartDate and EndDate saved as dates.  Right now I have no problem listing all seminars currently in progress, but I would like to filter those by ONLY those meeting on the day of the week that corresponds to the current weekday.  To do this I need to turn Wednesday 7pm into a DATE variable while still keeping the exact same format for echoing on the schedule.p

Negative 517 pIve got a legacy system that begins by reading config classes from an XML file, then performing some various other logic on the resulting object after theyve been deserialized.  p  pIn writing a tool to migrate old config files to the new format, Im trying to go through the regular serialization process, but will need to keep track of only those properties which have been deserialized from the XML file.  Is there a way to hook into the XML serializer to trigger some event for each property that it deserializesp  pConsider a class like the followingp  precodepublic class UrlPrefs     public string LoginUrl  httpdefault.comlogin     public string LogoutUrl  httpdefault.comlogout     public int MaxFailedLogins  3    ...  public UrlPrefs ReadUrlPrefsstring fileName     var ser  new XmlSerializertypeofUrlPrefs     usingvar stream  new StreamReaderfileName         UrlPrefs ret  UrlPrefsser.Deserializestream         return TouchUpPrefsFromDBret  Gets another layer of overrides from the database...       codepre  pThe following would be a valid UrlPrefs.xmlp  precodeltUrlPrefsgt     ltLoginUrlgthttpcustomer.comloginltLoginUrlgt     ltLogoutUrlgthttpcustomer.comlogoutltLogoutUrl ltUrlPrefsgt codepre  pNotice that MaxFailedLogins is not set in the XML, so will default to 3.br So, Id like to monitor the serializer to know that LoginUrl and LogoutUrl are the only ones that were touched.p  pNote I know I could feasibly convert those to properties and do some logic in the setter method, but were talking about hundreds of properties in the real world, not just the 3 from my example, so Im trying to avoid that kind of tedium.p

Is there a function where I can set the base URL for this or do I have to manually do a string replace with something like codepregreplacecode It seems odd to me that it would be default point to just the file name...theres got to be a standard procedure for fixing that link other than text manipulation.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 517 pNot long ago I built a maintenance request feature in my current MVC 4 project.  It worked out perfectly so when I needed another similar tooling request feature added I followed the same composition just with slightly modified tables and model properties etc.  Now for some reason within the tooling request controller none of the model binding seems to work each httppost method receives a null value for the model being passed.p  pFor the feature Ive created 3 models.

Negative 517 pI have an Android tablet running ICS 4.0.3 with kernel 3.0.8 which has 2 USB host ports, and both ports work with things like USB memory sticks, keyboards, mice and 3G dongles, so I know the hardware is functioning. I want to use the tablet with a USB Host Mode app but it isnt recognising the device Im plugging in.  After a bit of digging on stackoverflow and other places I found that the codeandroid.hardware.usb.host.xmlcode file was missing in the codesystemetcpermissionscode directory so I used adb to put it there and rebooted, but still it seems that USB Host Mode isnt working.  Im using USB Device Info from the Play Store and its reporting my device on the Linux side but not Android.p  pI havent tried it yet, but this answer  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11183792androidusbhostandhiddendevices1199268311992683Android USB host and hidden devicesa  says that I also need codeandroid.hardware.usb.hostcode in the codehandheldcorehardware.xmlcode or codetabletcorehardware.xmlcode file also in the codesystemetcpermissionscode directory, but other posts suggest I only need this for getting the right list of apps on the Play Store, so which is rightp  pMy worry is that Im missing something else  so what can I look for to be sure that the device is USB Host capable Is it possible to build 4.0.3 without USB Host support and, if so, what would be missingp  pOr maybe host mode only works with OTG ports and not hostonly ports.p  pAny suggestions for further avenues of investigation gratefully receivedp

Negative 517 pSo far Ive been using Session to pass some variables from one page to another. For instance user role. When a user logs in to the web application the role id of the user is kept in Session and that role is checked at different parts of the application. Ive recently started thinking why not use static members instead. I can store the same information in a static field and easily access it anywhere in my application well anywhere the namespace in which that static field resides is included. I know that using Session variables comes handy sometimes,  such thatp  ol liAny kind of data can be stored in Session. It then must be casted however.But static fields accept data with the correct datatype only.li liSession variables will expire after a certain time which is the behavior we need in many cases.li ol  pApart from the above, are there any other reasons why I should not use static fields to store data and have it available everywherep
Negative 517 pwere seeing a very odd issue with PHP taking a very long to resolve any hostname, which happens randomly every 510 attempts.

The commented out line uses dig from the command line to resolve, when this is used instead we see no issue. This is all very weird as they are using the same resolver. We have run this PHP script from the command line to take apache out of the equation too  same result, so it seems to be purely a PHP issue.p  pThe PHP docs say the gethostbyname function can take up to 4 seconds  were seeing considerably longer than this. We dont actually use this function  the real problem we have is with cURL calls timing out due to not being able to resolve the hostname. The script above is purely to assess whether we have a resolving problem in PHP, which we dop  pAt a total loss atm  googling has turned up very little. Even pointers to where we might start the investigation would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Here e[35m and e00m are color attribute modifierds the colour of a letter is determined by the last few color attribute escape sequences of form e[P1 P2 .. m where P1,P2, etc are sequence of digits e[P1me[P2m is equivalent to e[P1P2m .  e[0m makes the color default and forgets all the previous e[..m sequences e[34me[0m is equivalent to e[0m.  There are several independent attributes boldness, colour of the background, colour of foregroundletter each number in an escape sequence affects only one of them. Thus e[1me[35m is equivalent to e[135m but not e[351m nor e[35m  however, e[34me[35m are equivalent to e[35m because they both affect the same attirbute namely, color of the letterforegrnound. p

Can I set all the components of the form into the datamodule. I use the TDbGrid to see some values in design. But in the Tdatamodule I cant set a TDBGrid. Ok, I can live without the TDbGrid. So I transformed the TForm into TDataModule. But the TDataModule is not the answer. There I get the error Graphics.OutOfResource from a TBitmap. I think that the TBitmap is calling from the TppReport. Now Im done. Im changing my code all more than 2 days with no result. I leave the TThread for this time.p

Negative 517 pIve been reading up on Gradle and its repository support features. The docs indicate it supports Ivy or Maven repos. The implications of this are not entirely clear to me.p  pIn the case of a Maven repo, I think my understanding is more complete. When building, the local repository like Nexus or Artifactory will cache the required public dependencies form MavenCentral. For publishing, Gradle will generate a POM.xml for the project, and you can publish private artifacts back to the local repository. strongIs my understanding correctstrong I want to have control over the public dependencies being used, along with correcting mistakes in the public MavenCentral POMs.p  pFor Ivy, Im a little more confused. For one, strongwhat does a shared Ivy repo look likestrong Is it just a remote directory tree hosted over SSH, SFTP, HTTP, etc Does this work in mixed WindowsUnix environment strongHow does Gradle move the public dependencies and built artifacts into the shared Ivy repostrong Can Jenkins also perform this step, how Are additional build steps necessary when the new public dependencies are defined and they need to be moved into the shared Ivy repo, or is this done seamlesslyp  pFinally, assuming the features of the two models are basically the same.

So when you click a button to dismiss that UIAlertView it crashes the app.  Here is the crash thread 0p  precode    Thread 0 name  Dispatch queue com.apple.mainthread     Thread 0 Crashed     0   libobjc.A.dylib                 0x3bcc75b0 objcmsgSend  16     1   UIKit                           0x35f03c4c [UIAlertViewPrivate buttonClicked]  292     2   UIKit                           0x35e970c0 [UIApplication sendActiontofromforEvent]  68     3   UIKit                           0x35e97072 [UIApplication sendActiontoTargetfromSenderforEvent]  26     4   UIKit                           0x35e97050 [UIControl sendActiontoforEvent]  40     5   UIKit                           0x35e96906 [UIControlInternal sendActionsForEventswithEvent]  498     6   UIKit                           0x35e96dfc [UIControl touchesEndedwithEvent]  484     7   UIKit                           0x35dbf5ec [UIWindow sendTouchesForEvent]  520     8   UIKit                           0x35dac7fc [UIApplication sendEvent]  376     9   UIKit                           0x35dac116 UIApplicationHandleEvent  6150     10  GraphicsServices                0x37ac45a0 PurpleEventCallback  588     11  GraphicsServices                0x37ac41ce PurpleEventCallback  30     12  CoreFoundation                  0x33f79170 CFRUNLOOPISCALLINGOUTTOASOURCE1PERFORMFUNCTION  32     13  CoreFoundation                  0x33f79112 CFRunLoopDoSource1  134     14  CoreFoundation                  0x33f77f94 CFRunLoopRun  1380     15  CoreFoundation                  0x33eeaeb8 CFRunLoopRunSpecific  352     16  CoreFoundation                  0x33eead44 CFRunLoopRunInMode  100     17  GraphicsServices                0x37ac32e6 GSEventRunModal  70     18  UIKit                           0x35e002fc UIApplicationMain  1116     19  iShame                          0x000bbe90 main main.m16     20  libdyld.dylib                   0x3c103b1c start  0 codepre  pHere is my dealloc method on the top view controller which I would think would resolve the problem by setting them to nil in itp  precode     voiddealloc              noConnection  nil         userSetup  nil         userExist  nil         accountAlertView  nil         confirmed  nil         login  nil          if connection                      [connection cancel]             [UIApplication sharedApplication].networkActivityIndicatorVisible  NO             [MBProgressHUD hideHUDForViewself.view animatedYES]               codepre  pAny direction on where to go with this would be much appreciated.

Negative 517 pI have a contenteditable div in which I have multiple tags br, b, u, i and text and I need to get the caret position relative to the div, including all the tags. p  pFor example p  precodeltdiv idh contenteditabletruegtabcltbgtdefltbrgtghiltbgtjklltdivgt codepre  pIf the cursor is between g and h, I need the caret position to be 14. The problem is that the found methods that use a treeWalker do not work in this case. The bold tag is not found... probably because it isnt closed.

Negative 517 pWe have a test environment and a production environment with DB2 database and VB.net projects. We have recently added 4 columns to a 74 column table, giving a total of 78 columns. We have had this change in the testing environment for some time, but just added to production yesterday. In our VB.net code test and prod, we use a codeSelect  FROM TABLENAMEcode statement to get a single row from the database and display it. Everything works perfectly in the testing environment but, when we run the code and point to the production database, the four newly added columns are not included in the result, and we get an error when we try to access that data.p  pHere is where it gets weird. If we explicitly name the new columns in our select statement, they are included, and all is good. I know that we should explicitly name the columns, as a best practice, and that is what we are going to do but, I have to figure out what is happening.p  pFurther observations p  ul liIf I use System i Navigator to enter the codeSelect  FROM TABLENAMEcode query into the production database, all the columns are returned, including the 4 new columns.li liWe are using the EXACT same VB.NET code to access testings DB and productions DB... we run the project and just change the connection string from TestingDB to ProductionDB so, we have eliminated the possibility of different data object versions I think, etc. li ul  pSo, the columns are there if we use System i Navigator using codeSELECT code. The columns are there if we explicitly name them in our VB.NET code. But, if we use codeSelect code in our VB.NET code, the 4 new columns are excluded but only in the production version.p  pHas anyone seen anything like this behavior before p

Negative 517 pMy WPF application has a number of popup dialogs. Theres no real need to show them on the task bar. Problem is that by turning off ShowInTaskBar, they can be minimized to what I think is a somewhat unconventional representation just above the taskbar, and as such can be inadvertently pushed down in zorder behind the parent or other windows, thus seemingly disappearing, but still deactivating the parent while open. Theres no real need to minimize them anyway user might as well just closecancel, so I think it would make sense to disable minimize functionality for the popup windows. What would be the most straightforward way to do that still allow resizemaximizerestore As best I recall, this was no big deal in oldfashioned Win32MFCWinforms  either a checkbox setting to disable the minimize box or a simple tweak of the system menu.p  pOne of the favoured solutions Ive seen in a related QampA was to make the window NoResize, but I want most of them resizeable. Another answer was to customize the title bar... is that really necessary Would it be possiblefeasibleadvisable to access and tweak the system menu in WPF Any gotchas in doing sop

Negative 517 pShortbr I need to get the value of a specific pixel from a supplied high color depth image.p  pDetailsbr I am currently using Processing to make a Slitscanning program. Essentially, I am using a greyscale image to pick frames from an animation, and using pixels from those frames to make a new image.p  pFor example if the greyscale image has a black pixel, it takes the same pixel in the first frame, and adds it to an image. If its a white pixel, it does the same with the last frame.br Anything inbetween, naturally, picks the frames inbetween.p  pThe gist is, if supplied a horizontal gradient, and a video of a sunset, then youd have the start of the sunset on the left, slowly transitioning to the end on the right.p  pMy problem is, when using Processing, I seem to be only able to get greyscale values of  0255 using the default library.br strongBlack  0br White  255strongbr This limits me to using only 256 frames for the source animation, or to put up with a pixaly, unsmooth end image.p  pI really need to be able to supply, and thus get, pixel values in a much bigger range. Say,br strongBlack  0br White   65025strongbrp  pIs there any Java lib that can do this That I can supply, say, a HDR Tiff or TGA image file, and be able to read the full range of color out of itp  pThanks,p

Negative 517 pI have a block of code that executes a zip command from another classp  precodedef zipupcontents path name   Zipper.new path name end codepre  pThe problem is that it zips blank copies of all the files passed to it. But when I put a binding before the zip command like sop  precodedef zipupcontents path name   binding.pry   Zipper.new path name   binding.pry end codepre  pit zips the files successfully. I know this by checking the resulting files byte size from within pry on the second binding point with and without the first binding present. Without the binding, the zip archives byte size is half what it should be, and with the binding its the size I would expect.p  pThe Zipper class simply calls the system zip with backticks. I dont think thats the problem because Ive used that class without trouble in other contexts.

Negative 517 pI am planning to create a Windows 8phone app for my school which shows the grades, schedule and other things.

I have read the HTML Agility Pack and others but I dont know the best method. I just basically want to allow the student to login in my app and view their grades. What guide would you recommend to complete this projectp  pI can share the website but you cant just login if youre not a student of our university.p  pThis is the page source where you need to click

Negative 517 pI have a very basic and general doubt related to algorithm design. Ive learnt basic algorithm and now learning randomized algorithm. Everywhere I observed that a professor mostly focuses on designing the algorithm that will ultimately try to reduces the complexity. p  pThe usual wayWhat I observed is to learn some basicor an older algorithm which behaves badly in terms of complexity and so the objective is to modify that older one with a newer algorithm which should focus on reducing the complexity, without affecting the output. p  pBut in most of algorithm Ive studied, especially distributed algorithms in distributed operating systems such as algorithms for distributed mutual exclusion, distributed deadlock detection etc., what I observed is thatand mostly I think that the design of the algorithm should not focus only on complexity enhancement but it should focus on the perfection of the algorithm as well. p  pLets take an example of distributed mutual exclusion algorithm. The very basic algorithm is a Lamports algorithm and the modified versionby enhancing the complexity of it is the RicartAgarwala algorithm. Since in distributed environment the communication is mostly by means of message passing, for distributed mutual exclusion we have three kinds of messages  a Request critical resource b Reply the request c Release critical resource. The basic algorithm uses extra release messagesto inform all sites that the my site has released the critical resource, so you can enter. But in the advanced version what they did is they discarded these release messages by accommodating it in reply messages. And so they came up with some reduced complexity solution. p  pBut when I tried the implementation of these algorithms in java, I observed that even if the complexity of basic algorithm was bit higher but it was more perfect than the advanced one. Because by reducing the number of messages transferred in advanced solution, local site is no longer aware of the fact that remote site has actually released the resource or not  because on the confirmation of release message only site updates its local data structures such as request queue etc. If we dont send any explicit notification for release, then requests remains pending unnecessarily in request queue of the local site for entire run.p  pcodeSo my doubt is that if enhancement of complexity is so important, why cant perfection  I mean if algorithm  is producing perfect results at the cost of bit higher complexity then how does it matters as far as I am getting perfection in output as compared to the enhanced complexity solution which lacks in perfection codep  pNote  By perfection I dont mean correctincorrect results. Results are always correct. Only the perfection or accuracy of the produced result varies.p

Negative 517 pI have a class library CoreLib which exposes a bunch of functionality, both outofthe box and through addons.p  pThe interface for interacting with addons is very general on purpose, where each addon can return metadata describing the properties it exposes. The base class for addons looks something like thisp  precodepublic abstract class AddOnBase     public abstract IListltPropertyDescriptorgt GetPropertyDescriptors   public void SetPropertyValueGuid propertyId, object value   public object GetPropertyValueGuid propertyId  codepre  pThis generality works very nicely for someone building a UI to expose the addons properties.p  pHowever, if someone wants to work with the addon in plain old .NET code, its way too cumbersome. For examplep  precode Declare some published IDs to identify the Recipe addon and its properties. Guid recipeAddOnId  new Guid... Guid recipeTitlePropId  new Guid... Guid recipeCategoryPropId  new Guid...  AddOn addon  coreLib.GetServiceIAddOnService.GetAddOnInstancerecipeAddOnId   Set some properties in the recipe addon. addon.SetPropertyValuerecipeTitlePropId, Cupcakes addon.SetPropertyValuerecipeCategoryPropId, Baked Goods   Do something with the addon. coreLib.GetServiceIAddOnService.ProcessAddOnaddon codepre  pThis works fine, but theres all these GUIDs that the developer needs to look up, and it makes everything really clunky.p  pI would much rather the developer could add a reference to the RecipeAddOn and write something like this insteadp  precodeGuid recipeAddOnId  RecipeAddOn.Id  AddOn addon  coreLib.GetServiceIAddOnService.GetAddOnInstancerecipeAddOnId   Cast the instance returned by CoreLib to a RecipeAddOn RecipeAddOn recipe  RecipeAddOnaddon   Set some properties in the recipe addon. recipe.Title  Cupcakes recipe.Category  Baked Goods   Do something with the addon. coreLib.GetServiceIAddOnService.ProcessAddOnrecipe codepre  pHere, not only do they not have to mess with GUIDs to identify properties, but they get to work with more concrete classes and get intellisense to help them in their development.p  pMy current solution is to have the developer reference both CoreLib and RecipeAddOn, with codeCopyLocalcode set to codefalsecode on the latter.  However, its been suggested that this can lead to DLL hell see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq20207643270348Why do I need an AssemblyResolve handler for an assembly which is already loadeda, so I wanted to ask what is the proper way to do this.p

Negative 517 pIm using breeze  EF as part of my asp.net mvc 4 project spa.p  pWhen creating an entity with primary key which is set by the user not defined as identity or computed, the user must set this key in the client.p  pAfter editing existing entity by changing the value of that entity key in the client and saving changes the request is transmitted successfully, the server breeze controller executes savebundle and everything seems to behave as expacted. Yet the change is not saved to the database using sql profiles shows that no sql statement is being called. Performing the same process while changing property value that is not part of the key works as expected. Does anyone had such an issuep  pThanks,br Eranp

I will explain the comflags as simply as I can.p  pcomflags a hrefhttpi.imgur.comi62g8kW.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comi62g8kW.pngap  pComflagid is just a unique id for that specific flag, comflagcid is referring to the id of the comment comid that the flag is put on. comflagownerid is referring to the user id that owns that flag and lastly, comflagflagged is 0 if the comment is unread or unseen, I will later program it to change to 1 as soon as the user in question has seen that comment.p  pNow, the flags are there to keep track of what comment is NEW for a specific user. If someone writes a comment on another users status update, the author of that status update will recieve a flag in comflags with the information about that comment.

Negative 517 pI am fairly new to programming and I am currently stumped by an issue.  I wrote a little script in python to compare to csv files which contain usernames for email groups that must be maintained.  The script I wrote was working perfectly for csv files that were in the 200300 item range, however, I just started testing files with a couple thousand values and my script seems to miss the very last item on each list.p  pThe idea here is that I have 2 csv files, an old list and a new list.  The way I receive the files is a bit finicky, so before processing the lists, I create an new csv form each of the csvs I am dealing with.  So basically a oldclean csv and a newclean csv.  I then check each item in oldclean against newclean to see if each item is in the new list, if its not it gets added to remove.csv to be processed into the email system latter. I then run the test the other way around to find new names which go into add.csv.  The issue I have is that the last name on the list, which is on both the old and new csv file, shows up on the add.csv and the remove.csv.p  pAs I stated, this only happens with larger files.  My code is below, any help would be appreciated. p  precodeimport sys import csv import re import os  Works in python 2.5  create a new csv for cleaned values from first csv entered o  openfirst.csv,w data  opensys.argv[1].read o.write re.sub ,,data  o.close  create a new csv for cleaned values from second csv entered n  opensecond.csv,w data  opensys.argv[2].read n.write re.sub ,,data  n.close  create csv of names to remove from group remove  openChangesremove.csv,w  create csv of names to add to group add  openChangesadd.csv,w  time.sleep3  adds any names from first list not found in second list to the remove.csv for line in openfirst.csv     if line not in opensecond.csv             remove.writeline remove.close          adds any names from second list not found in first list to the add.csv         for line in open second.csv     if line not in openfirst.csv         add.writeline add.close          remove the generated clean csv files os.removefirst.csv os.removesecond.csv codepre

Negative 517 pOur game requires that several large textures are built up dynamically from small images, and we dont keep a data copy of the textures, we just use OpenGL with codeglTexSubImage2dcode to update the actual textures.p  pWhen Back is pressed, or the game loses focus, we want to save these textures to ram, so if the user then goes back to the game, we can recreatereload them in codeonSurfaceCreatedcode. We already reload from disk all static textures.p  pHowever, its proving hard to find out where we can get a message to know that we are about to lose the EGL context. If we set a flag in the main activitys codeonBackPressedcode then check that flag in the main render loop, we can save the textures there, but we cant access the textures from the main activity, so putting the call in the main activitys codeonStopcode callback is too late. There is no subsequent render loop to save the textures, as, well, its stopped by then. We need to do this as there will be other ways where codeonStopcode is called other than pressing the Back button.p  pSupposedly I cant delay codeonStopcode to get one more render in either.

Negative 517 pI have no problems with running the TCP Server and I like the fact that its in blocking to avoid useless loops and sleeping code and useless cpu cycles.p  pThe problem happens when shutting it down in Linux environment, it stays on, until the connected user sends something, then it turns off.p  pI figured its because its blocking even though the endless while loop is set to exit.

Negative 517 pSO having some issues with trying to debug a program that Im using, and wondered if anyone could help me out.p  pThe current environment is Im running Cassandra v2, using cqlsh v3 that comes with it. Im making changes to some of its functionality, and then using cqlsh to test commands to see if my changes are working as intended, or if not what the input looks like as I step through the program. I start up a debugging session either in eclipse of IntelJ, doesnt really matter, firing up the server code to accept connectionsinput. I then load up cqlsh, and specify the keyspace that I want to use. This seems to work fine. I then execute a line of cql to test my changes via command line. What I expect to see is the command line entry being caught by the debugger in my IDE, where I can see how the input is handled by my code changes. What Im seeing is nothing happening at all, as if no command was submitted.p  pSo my questions would be the followingp  p1 Should I see anything in my debugging IDE when executing commands as described above 2 If not, how would you debug a server based application that has this configuration, especially in the realm of handling user input 3 If so, what settings should I check to see if I have set correctly, or what processes should be followed to view and debug said submissionsp  pI figure there has to be a better way then having 50,000 System.out.println all over the place assuming theyd even work, or at least, I hope there is.p  pThanks for anyone that reads this.

In the above method, I simply check if the cursor location intersects one of the grid squares. If it does, I make the grid square renderFull, which renders a fullfilled in rectangle of a different color. Also in this method, I draw a circle of where the current cursor pointer is. And this is where my problem is. When I run my program, the circle is not where my cursor is. I spent about an hour debugging and trying to come up with some algorithm based on the zoom to correctly align it, but to no avail. Is there a way to get the correct position of my cursor no matter my zoom And also, this may be an issue I run into, my world sizethe grid is about 10000 pixels long. Will the cursor position also move along with this, or will it stay within the actual programsJframes size And if so, any way I can fix thisI suppose it would be as simple as adding on the cameras position to the cursors position, but just wanted to check just in case.

Negative 517 pOk, so basically I have a class in use in another class which, among other things, asks on object to report on its relationship to another object of the same type. Works great.

Negative 517 pSo, I have some big song list in plain text. I wrote a parser that creates a list of structures containing artist, title and length of the songs.

Negative 517 pSo Ive got a hybrid ecommerce iOS app that Im working on, and I need to store multiple string  array values temporarily for the duration of the checkout process.

Otherwise, at periods of time during the checkout process I want to be able to retrieve these values and use them.p  pWhats the best way to achieve this Core Data seems a little more permanent than Im looking for, but it might be the right way to go. I can always store stuff in there and delete it when the user leaves the checkout process, but Im wondering if theres a better way to do it, basically.p  pA note about the hybrid part p  ul liWhen the user clicks checkout, we launch a WebView and the checkout process continues there. li liI have a data retrieval class instantiated via a JS bridge that retrieves some data, but the class goes out of memory basically as soon as its done retrieving datali liI need to access said data from the javascript in multiple separate parts, after the data retrieval class has gone out of memoryli ul  pSo, taking that into consideration, where is the best place for me to store the data that is retrieved by the data retrieval class Sample code, of course, is always welcome .

Negative 517 pI have read that we must be careful while coding synchronized blocks or methods because if a thread exits from a synchronized methodblock because of an exception, the synchronization lock is released cause the memory model couldnt care less about whether a thread exited because of an exception. So the synchronization lock is going to be available for grabs by other threads even though the object might be in a corrupted state.p  pSo if we consider best practices, are there any guidelines that we could follow for writing synchronized methodsblocks. Personally I think locks are quite good because of their try  finally  semantics but if we have an API that needs to absolutely have the synchronized methodsblocks, what would be a good approach of coding these synchronized methodsblocks. I thought that it might be good to also employ the try finally approach for the synchronized methods but then the StringBuffer class does not use that approach. Im not sure if any of the standard classes that have synchronized methods use that approach. So then should leaving the logging part to an uncaughtExceptionHandler be the way out p  pAre there any other good practices that could come in handy Is there a way to prevent other threads from acquiring the synchronization lock, should an objects state get corrupted. UncaughtExceptionHandlers and finally blocks can at the most perform additional logging. Would that be right They cant really prevent other threads from subsequently acquiring the synchronization lock. Would that be right So then how should we code the synchronized methodsblocks in Javap

Negative 517 pI am using ImageLoader in my app to load images for tableview. It works perfect for small images as it was designed for. But in my app I load some images that are nearly 3MB and when I load in a tableview45 cells my app crashes after couple of refreshes. I understand that the ImageLoader is not the right API for this, but how do I download or infact load a scaled down version of the image so that there is no memory hog. The tableview does not need a high resolution image and since its showing a small thumbnail size, I would like to know what is the best option to load in IOS and if there are any predefined API available. For Android I use the android developer recommended bitmap sizing functions to scale down the image.p

Negative 517 pIm trying to build a java program that needs to store data in a SQL database which needs to be embedded in my application so I can carry out the app to any PC and the data persists.p  pThen, my paradigm is the following.p  pMAIN TABLE has four relationships with four tables. All of them are 0N on each side, so an example would bep  precodeMAINTABLE 0n  0n TABLE1 codepre  pThe same for TABLE2, TABLE3 and TABLE4 giving an example.p  pUntil here all is OK, the problem comes when MainTable ONLY could have ONE relationship, being with table1 OR table2 OR table3 OR table4. They cannot never be two or more of them. To solve the NM relationships, the tables alpha, beta, gamma and lambda come in, one handling the relationship of each TABLEX with MAINTABLE.p  pSome people told me to use triggers that checks if a row on MAINTABLE already has a relationship with the three other tables, and if true, abort the insert, something like thisp  precodeDELIMITER  CREATE TRIGGER checker1 BEFORE INSERT ON alpha FOR EACH ROW BEGIN   DECLARE count INTEGER   SELECT countMAINTABLEid INTO count FROM beta WHERE beta.MAINTABLEid NEW.MAINTABLEid   IF count gt 0 THEN SIGNAL SQLSTATE 45000 SET messagetext  THE ROW IS ALREADY CONNECTED TO ANOTHER TABLE.   END IF   SELECT countMAINTABLEid INTO count FROM gamma WHERE gamma.MAINTABLEid NEW.MAINTABLEid   IF count gt 0 THEN SIGNAL SQLSTATE 45000 SET messagetext  THE ROW IS ALREADY CONNECTED TO ANOTHER TABLE.   END IF   SELECT countMAINTABLEid INTO count FROM lambda WHERE lamba.MAINTABLEid NEW.MAINTABLEid   IF count gt 0 THEN SIGNAL SQLSTATE 45000 SET messagetext  THE ROW IS ALREADY CONNECTED TO ANOTHER TABLE.   END IF END DELIMITER  codepre  pI tried using Derby and HSQL, but both of them doesnt support the DELIMITER command, and without changing the delimiter its impossible to save a trigger as it encounters a semicolon the process stops.p  pWhich DB could I use to solve this, or how can I do it with Derby or HSQL My program will be written in Java and the Database should control almost all situations.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 517 pI consider a simple multiinput binary linear strongclassification algorithmstrong similar to perceptron. p  pThere are strongSstrong states of the world that differ in strongWstrong vector. For each state of the world, I simulate strongAstrong number of emagentsem who play a strongRstrong emroundsem of game. The strongDstrongdimensional eminputem is randomly generated in each round and observed by the computational agent strongastrong. The true weights strongWstrong that are used to compute the emoutcomeem strongYstrong for each round, on the ofter hand, are unknown to the agent strongastrong. Since the classification function strongact.funstrong is given 0 or 1, the computational agent has only to learn by updating his subjective weights strongpWstrong after he observes the difference error strongEstrong between his empredicted outcomeem strongpYstrong and true outcome strongYstrong. The strongBstrong is a filter and strongLstrong is a emlearning rateem, both remain constant factors that affect the computational agents learning speed learning speed. p  pThe simulated performance accuracy with sample data looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgp3Tk.jpg altenter image description here p  pHere are the inputs for the learning algorithm p  precodeSlt2 States of the world Alt500 agents simulated  Rlt200 rounds per simulated game Dlt4  single round input dimensions Llt0.05 Learning Rate Bltc1, rep0.1, each  D1 Bias filter W1ltc0.6,0.2, rep0.10, each  D2 True weights State of the world 1 W2ltcrep0.10, each  D2,0.2,0.6  True weights State of the world 2  act.funcltfunctionxreturnxgt01.

Negative 517 pI am currently working on an enterprise solution which is deployed as an EAR module in weblogic12c. I need to write a business logic where there will be entity manager methods which perform some updates on database using strongEntityManagerstrong interface with a hrefhttpeclipse.orgeclipselink relnofollowstrongEclipseLinkstronga and I need to have an Interceptor around these methods which will intercept the method calls and push some data to JMS queue if the target method does not fail.p  pSince interceptors live inside same transaction and security context as the intercepted method, so if one fails, it causes the other to fail, i.e. if done by throwing an strongEJBExceptionstrong. My problem is regarding those transaction rollback exception which you cannot catch before the transaction is actually committed. So even if the intercepted method gets a strongRollbackExceptionstrong, the interceptor is not immediately terminated since its running in the same transaction model, so it cannot catch those rollback exceptions. Eventually it is rolled back too, but in the meantime, data gets pushed to JMS queue which is not really desirable.p  pI also cannot take the JMS queue part out of the interceptor, because, as a software requirement, if the module fails to push data to jms, the transaction should fail and rollback too. So what I am trying to achieve here is, if the intercepted method fails, the transaction will fail too and there should not be any execution in the interceptor beyond context.proceed method call.p  pNow, lets say I have a business methodp  precodeTransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIRESNEW InterceptorsTestInterceptor.class Override public TestBean updateTestBean testBean      try          TestEntity testEntity  em.createNamedQueryTestEntity.findById, TestEntity.class                 .setParameterid, testBean.getId                 .getSingleResult          only some bean conversions before merging         testEntity.setNametestBean.getName         testEntity.setPhonetestBean.getPhone         testEntity.setImagetestBean.getImage         em.mergetestEntity         em.flush         testBean.setVersiontestEntity.getVersion         logger.debugUpdate successful         return testBean      catch Exception ex          logger.debugupdateexception , ex         throw ex       codepre  pAnd a web service methodp  precodeMethodPrivilegeMethodRole.GENERIC WebMethod Override public String testDataCRUDWebParamname  auth AuthRequest authRequest,                            WebParamname  id Long id,                            WebParamname  name String name,                            WebParamname  phone String phone,                            WebParamname  image byte[] image,                            WebParamname  action Action action      ...      build testBean from received parameters     ...     try          testManager.updatetestBean         return SUCCESS      catchException ex          return FAILED  UPDATE Error   ex.getMessage       codepre  pAnd finally here is the interceptor methodp  precodeAroundInvoke private Object aroundInvocationContext ctx throws Exception      Object testParam  null     TestBean testBean  null      logger.debugTest intercepted      try          testParam  ctx.proceed      catchException ex          logger.debugInterceptor exception , ex         throw new EJBExceptionTarget method raised an exception           do some bean conversion here     ...     ...      construct the message object here     boolean success  jmsNotifier.sendmessage, false     ifsuccess          throw new ExceptionJMS failed.           logger.debugSuccessfully sent to jms      return testParam  codepre  pNow if the business method gets a RollbackException, the service layer can catch it because the business method initiated a new transaction. But so far I am unable to catch it in the try catch block around ctx.proceed as a result, the code goes on and pushes data to jms queue and then gets the exception upon completion of the transaction. How can I resolve this issue Note sorry for my bad English, please let me know if I need to clarify some part of it any farther.p  pstrongUpdatestrong After a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers2092358displaynameismissingDisplay Name is missingas commentp  pTo describe why I am doing this  say for example I am adding an additional jar package to an existing ejb project, the service layer and the business  entity manager layer is from an existing application. Now, the additional ejb jar I am adding performs some additional stuffs around the target business methods and there can be many methods like this. So any of my colleagues can grab the jar, add it to their projects and I need a way so that it will require them a minimal amount of change in their business or entity methods. So far what I have tried is, all they need to do is to add an Interceptor class which then can use the functionality of the my plugin library. That way only change needed in the business layer is to add an extra line stating the Interceptor annotation and existing code base not modified by a great extent.p  pAlso tried adding em.flush but it does not help in the described circumstances. Any help is much appreciated.p

Negative 517 pIve looked at the various ways to embed a web browser into an application like IE or Safari via OSspecific means, or FirefoxMozilla via XULRunner, or Chrome via the Chromium Embedded Framework and Ive managed to integrate CEF with my app up to a point where Im convinced that itll all work as expected.  Now, it seems to me that whenever I want to modify the DOM e.g. to add or remove elements, Ill have to do this via Javascript, i.e. my application calls out to Javascript where the actual work is done.p  pI wonder why this is so.  My naive belief is that if for example I call codeappendChildcode in Javascript, the actual work of appending a child will eventually be performed by a CC function as the browser itself is written in CC and not in Javascript.  So, Im wondering why in an embedded web browser I cant call this CC function directly instead of going through Javascript.  I understand that for general scripting you dont want other languages than Javascript for security reasons, but if the browser is embedded into an application I can control anyway this shouldnt be the reason, should itp  pWhat am I missingp

Negative 517 pI am developing an IE addon that has to login to a site and fill a form automatically as soon as the user clicks a button. The following is the url with login credentials as parameters that it needs to go to in order to loginIts not encrypted.

I have to close the browser and start it back in order for it to login again using that URL. p  pMy deduction from this is whenever I enter right username and wrong password in the url and go it will create a session and after that even if I give the right password in the URL it wont care. When I close the browser the session will be destroyed. p  pMy question is there a way by which I can destroy the session details for a site using an addon Or is there a way by which I can make that site think that I closed the browser so that it will destroy the session Note Changing the JSP code in the site is not an optionp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 517 pHi I have a question about different types of drawable assets. I know there are mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi... and so on. What I usually do is to create an icon, I create a big one like 144x144 and put it in xxhdpi only. So if the device is mdpi or hdpi, the icon will be shrinked automatically and it looks okay to me. I am wondering if this is a normal way if want to use the same image for all these types. If I want to use different images based on dpi, of course I will have to create images for mdpi, hdpi and so on.. but if I want to support only one image then is it considered okay Are there any drawbacksp

Negative 517 pShort version How do I reference a collection by variable in Liquidp  pIm building a site on Jekyll which is documentation with multiple different parts. It consists of collections of articles and there are no blogposts. Right now I have a three level menu structure defined with data files, where the third level is the actual articles. The data file look like this.p  pmenu.ymlp  precode title Book   url book   subpages     title Volume 1     url bookvol1    title Volume 2     url bookvol2  title The Library   url library   subpages     title Getting started     url librarygettingstarted    title Components     url librarycomponents  title Theme   url theme   subpages     title Tutorials     url themetutorials    title Reference     url themereference codepre  pAdditionally, I have collections defined that match the top level items by url.p  pconfig.ymlp  precode... collections   book     output true   library     output true   theme     output true codepre  pRight now I use the menu YML to construct myself a nice two level structure and put the articles into them to form the third level. The problem is that I dont know how to call the collections dynamically when I am constructing the menu. For example when I am creating the Book menu item, Id like to loop over site.book data collection with something like thisp  precode assign collection  book   for p in site.collection    ltpgtp.titleltpgt  endfor  codepre  pcodesite.collectioncode doesnt work there but for example calling directly codesite.bookcode does. I dont know how to pass the variable in Liquid.p  pWhat I do to get around this problem is that for every menu item that I create i loop through the whole codesite.pagescode which contains all the articles in the whole site, and match their url against the menu item url. These feels like bad programming on so many levels and Im taking a huge performance hit when looping through everything multiple times. Generation of files goes up four times, from 5 seconds to 20 seconds right now, and it will get even worse when I make the menu even larger.p  pSo Im open to hearing how I could loop dynamically through the collections, or hearing about other options to create such a menu.

Negative 517 pI want to fit a distribution to my data. I use fitdistrplus package in r to find the distribution. I can compare the goodness of fit results for different distributions to see which one is more fitted to my data but I dont know how to check the pvalue for goodness of fit test for each of the distributions. The results might show that among gamma, lognormal and exponential, exponential distribution has the lower statistics for anderson darling test but I dont know how to check if pvalue for these tests does not reject the null hypothesis. Is there any built in function in R which gives the pvalues  Here is a piece of code I used as an examplep  precode    d lt sample100,50     libraryfitdistrplus     descdistd     fitg lt fitdistd,gamma     fitg2 lt fitdistd,exp     gofstatlistfitg,fitg2 codepre  pThis code makes 50 random numbers from 0 to 100 and tries to find best fitted model to these data. If descdistd shows that gamma and exponential are the two candidates as the best fitted model, fitg and fitg2 finds their related models. the last line compares Ks and anderson darling statistics to show which distribution is most fitted. Distribution with lower value for these tests is the best. However, I dont know how to find pvalues for fitg and fitg2 before comparying them. If pvalues show that none of these distributions are not fitted to these data, there is no point to comparing their goodness of fit statistics to my knowledge. p  pAny help is appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 517 pI just created a UIPickerView with three components. The user selects numbers in wheel 1 and 2 and based on those selections it will show either one of two possible arrays in wheelcomponent 3. Ive got it to work fine with one exceptionp  pProblem In order to have the 3rd component updated based on selection of component 1 and 2, the user has to actually physically select an item by moving the picker wheels. But there might be situation in which the user wants to use the default selection in my case an NSString 0 in component 1 and 2 and does not touch those wheels. Therefore component 3 will not get updated.p  pAny idea how to address this problem Is there a way I can update the UIPickerView before the user selects the item in the third component, in order to tricker the default selection in component 1 and 2 as an actual selection without having the user actually move those wheelsp  pOr lets formulate the question that way can I have the default row of a UIPickerView automatically selected without selecting the particular row with the fingerp  pstrongAdditional explanation of what I try to accomplishstrong when the user clicks in a textfield, an UIPickerView with three columns will open up. In the first wheel the user selects a number between 0 and 16, in the second he will select a fraction, and in the third a measuring unit. For example 1 12 cups, 1 ounce, 12 cup, etc. Based on the number and fraction selection the unit names in the third picker wheel will either be shown in singular or plural spelling 1 cup vs. 2 cups. The whole thing works perfectly as long the first two wheels are touched and a physically selection is done. Problem lets take for example that the user wants to select 1 ounce. He will move the first wheel to 1, will leave the second alone as it is already positioned on the 0, and then choose ounces. But with my code the third wheel will not update to singular spelling. ONLY, if I actually move the second wheel and go back to 0. Then the 3rd wheel instantly changes.p  pThanksp  pHere is the code I have so farp  precode    countPickerData  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]         fractionPickerData  [0, 12, 14, 18, 34, 38, 58, 78]         singularUnitPickerData  [NONE, ounce, cup, pound]         pluralUnitPickerData  [NONE, ounces, cups, pounds]   The number of columns of data      NSIntegernumberOfComponentsInPickerViewUIPickerView pickerView              return 3            The number of rows of data      NSIntegerpickerViewUIPickerView pickerView numberOfRowsInComponentNSIntegercomponent              switch component              case 0 return [countPickerData count]             case 1 return [fractionPickerData count]             case 2                  if [countHelper isEqualToString1] ampamp [countFractionHelper isEqualToString0]  [countHelper isEqualToString0] ampamp [countFractionHelper isEqualToString12 ]  [countFractionHelper isEqualToString14]  [countFractionHelper isEqualToString18]                                      return [singularUnitPickerData count]                                  else                                      return [pluralUnitPickerData count]                                   return 0            The data to return for the row and component column thats being passed in      NSStringpickerViewUIPickerView pickerView titleForRowNSIntegerrow forComponentNSIntegercomponent              switch component                      case 0 return [countPickerData objectAtIndexrow]             case 1 return [fractionPickerData objectAtIndexrow]             case 2                 if [countHelper isEqualToString1] ampamp [countFractionHelper isEqualToString0]  [countHelper isEqualToString0] ampamp [countFractionHelper isEqualToString12 ]  [countFractionHelper isEqualToString14]  [countFractionHelper isEqualToString18]                                      pickedUnitHelper  [singularUnitPickerData objectAtIndexrow]                     return pickedUnitHelper                                  else                                      pickedUnitHelper  [pluralUnitPickerData objectAtIndexrow]                     return pickedUnitHelper                              defaultbreak         return nil            Preparing pickerView selection for textFieldIngredientUnit     NSInteger selectedRowUnit      voidpickerViewUIPickerView pickerView didSelectRowNSIntegerrow inComponentNSIntegercomponent              switch component                      case 0                 countHelper  [countPickerData objectAtIndexrow]                 return              case 1                 countFractionHelper  [fractionPickerData objectAtIndexrow]                 return              case 2                 if [countHelper isEqualToString1] ampamp [countFractionHelper isEqualToString0]  [countHelper isEqualToString0] ampamp [countFractionHelper isEqualToString12 ]  [countFractionHelper isEqualToString14]  [countFractionHelper isEqualToString18]                                      pickedUnitHelper  [singularUnitPickerData objectAtIndexrow]                     return                                   else                                      pickedUnitHelper  [pluralUnitPickerData objectAtIndexrow]                     return                               defaultbreak               codepre

Negative 517 pI had an abstract class Foo.  I want to get a list of classes that derive from it.  All my searches are returning how to do it via code, and really Im just wondering if theres some built in feature of VS that will do it for me... seems simple enough just to get a list for nonprogramming purposes.

Negative 517 pIm still on the learning curve with LabVIEW and MATLAB and could use some pointers on something.  Im using LabVIEW to create a small application to receive data from a digital source, perform a lookup and calculation routine, visualize the result for the user, and allow the user to control the inputs to the routine, but I received the calculation routine as an mfile and I dont want to have to recreate it in LabVIEW because its a lot of math.  Will MathScript work for me without requiring the user to have MATLAB installed  p  pOr should I bite the bullet and redo it in LabVIEW  Or am I asking too much from LabVIEW in the first place and should just do the whole thing in MATLABp
Negative 517 pI have been using a DAO pattern to provide access to my persistence tier in an application that I have been building. p  pOne of the things that I have implemented is a wrapper around my DAO implementations for purposes of validation. The wrapper takes in an instance of my DAO as a constructor parameter, and implements a similar interface as the DAO, with the exception being the types of exceptions thrown.p  pFor examplep  pBusiness Logic Interfacep  precodepublic interface UserBLInt      private void assignRightToUserint userId, int rightId throws SomeAppException   codepre  pDAO Interfacep  precodepublic interface UserDAOInt      private void assignRightToUserint userId, int rightId throws SomeJPAExcption   codepre  pBusiness Logic Implementationp  precodepublic class UserBLImpl implements  UserBLInt      private UserDAOInt userDAO     public UserBLImplUserDAOInt userDAO       this.userDAO  userDAO         Override    private void assignRightToUserint userId, int rightId throws SomeAppException       ifuserExistsuserId          throw an exception              try          userDAO.assignRightToUseruserId, rightId        catchSomeJpAException e         throw new SomeAppExceptionsome message               codepre  pDAO Implementationp  precodepublic class UserDAOImpl implements UserDAOInt        ......

Since I have the wrapper around the DAO, is it still a good idea to do the null checking anyway in the DAO I know in theory the object could be deleted between the business logic call and the dao call, its just unlikely, and checking for null seems like duplicated work. What is the best practice for a situation like thisp  pEDITp  pDoes this look like a suitable DAO modificationp  precodepublic EntityManager beginTransaction     EntityManager entityManager  entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager     EntityTransaction entityTransaction  entityManager.getTransaction     entityTransaction.begin     return entityManager   public void rollbackEntityManager entityManager     entityManager.getTransaction.rollback     entityManager.close   public void commitEntityManager entityManager     entityManager.getTransaction.commit     entityManager.close  codepre

Negative 517 pI have implemented RDLC reports in MVC4 web application returning pdf file bytes. Whenever a user requests a report, the web application stops all other requests for all users unless this report is rendered.

Lets say the web server is busy rendering the report, and in a new tab I try to request some other data it wont show unless that RDLC completes its operation. Same happens in development machine.

How do I fix this so it runs when the refresh is clicked  Eventually Im going to hide the ribbon from the users but thats not an option in the short term. p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 517 pI have 30 files UE1.dat, UE2.dat, ......, all of the them consist of 2 columns the first one is the delay and the second one is its CDF. So because i dont have the CDF value for all delays in the range [100600], i had to interpolate the second columns according to the first one in all those 30 files and after that to normalize the data between 0 and 1. Everything works perfect until now. p  pIn the end I have to plot a graph, which consists of x, y and the y errorbars. codexcode is the range 1001600, codeycode is the mean for every row of the interpolated data for every codexcode from 100 to 600 by step 1, and for the y errorbars I calculate the standard deviation for every y row as well. p  pBut when I plot the data with error bars it looks weird and i have some strange x dashes, while if I plot only x against y everything looks good.

Negative 517 pI want to build a Windows Service in C which listens to an MSMQ queue for incoming print command messages. A message references a PDF document und contains the name of the destination printer and maybe some other metadata like numbers of copies to print. The service should pick up the PDF and print it on the destination printer. p  pQuestion Is it possible to print an arbitrary PDF on a printer from a Windows Servicep  psupplementp  pThe implementation should not depend on Acrobat Reader or any other GUI tool. The Windows service runs headless. Besides I want to avoid to start a separate process for each print job when this is possible.p
Negative 517 pstrongEditstrong Looking back, I think my initial post was a little confusing and was lacking detail. So Id like to reword it and provide some more information. Also, Ive included a diagram example. p  pAnd please correct me if I have the wrong idea somewhere, but the idea is thisp  ul liUsers belong to one company, and a company can have many users.li liUsers can belong to many roles, and roles can have many users.li liA company belongs to one company type. For example, there could be an internal company type, and a distributor company type.li liBased on the companys company type, the user roles will be different and nonoverlapping. For example, if you are a distributor, you could have the roles of Distributor Admin and Distributor User. The same applies for the internal type Super Admin, Admin, Sales Rep, etc. This explains the relationship between companytype and roles A company type can have many roles, and a role belongs to one company type.li ul  pSo basically, if a user is part of a certain company, which is of a certain company type, that determines the roles that they can be assigned. If that makes sense so far, great p  pThe missing piece deals with how to handle a sales rep. Essentially, a sales rep is just a user that deals with other companies. I dont want them to be completely separate entities, because then Id be duplicating information. I do have a sales rep role for the internal company type, but Im not sure if that would tie in properly. p  pDoes it make sense to do a 1to1 relationship between the user and sales rep not done in the diagram, which means I could always just do a join to get the user informationp  pThe end result will allow me to find all the sales reps for a company, and then all the companies for a sales rep.p  pThanks in advancep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comskzXV.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comskzXV.png alterd diagramap

Negative 517 pThere are instancebased functions and instance variables that I need to call from a custom Django migrations file. Can I do this, and if so, howp  pFor example I have an instance, c, of class Car. How do I call c.honk from within a migrations file, or access c.colour p  pP.S. I know that I can import models within the migrations file using ModelName  apps.getmodelappname, ModelName , and I know that I can call classbased functions by doing strongimportstrongappname.pythonfile.functionname .

Negative 517 pi have a question, about the sequence diagram and .Net MVC WebApp. As i asked before, the Client directly interacts with the Controller, who does the rest. So can i use a method from the Client to the Controller, which includes the data as parameters or is it always a HTTP requestresponse, for example if i want to send data in an html form element from the Client to the Controller or should i just use the HTTP Request, from Client to Controller, and the parameter are shown afterwards, if the Controller uses a method or something... My Problem If i want to model a full Web Shop with an Sequence Diagram, i have many requests from the Client and it would be a bit confusing, if the request would always be a Standard HTTP Request from Client to Controller without any identity.
