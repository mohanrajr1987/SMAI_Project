Positive 8097 pIm looking at the documentation for baked queries and it isnt obvious to me how I would accomplish subqueries or ctes using baked queries. In other words, it doesnt appear possible to create a baked query and then select from it using another baked query.p  pI see there is the undocumented function asquery which converts it to a regular query, but once you do that I dont see a way to have another baked query select from it unless you implement some sort of caching system based on the values input into the subquery, which pretty much defeats the purpose of baking the first query in the first place.p  pedit Actually, asquery bypasses all caching so using it defeats the purpose of the bakery.p

But the first parent we encounter in the third table we have to stop there lowest indexp  pBecause as you can see the last record in the second table has item1234 which has category Gels. item1234 is parent of item560 but still have different item types so for item99 we have to stop at lowest index i.e. item560 immediate parent that we found and move on.p  pSo here is the sequence, for item001 we didnt find an entry in table 2 so we choose the first parent i.e. item99 which also did not have an entry in the table 2 so we moved on third parent and found the record in table 2 so we stop therep  panother example for item005 no entry in table 2 so we move to parent item006 at index 0 we find the entry in table 2 so we stop herep

I simplified it a bit to make it clearer, but its a working query and the problem is there. Note that I have hardcoded the value 2 in this query two times.

Positive 8097 pI am working on a report for our company which is a Speed Report. This is data that is collected from our fleet of vehicles. We have configured parameters to flag who is speeding above a certain threshold based on State they were driving, posted speed limit for that location, etc.p  pMy SQL query is using a CTE. When selecting from my CTE I am wrapping inside of it two select statements. One select statement is for the records that meet or exceed the threshold requirement. I have a field named SpeedingEvent and those records contain a value of Y for Yes. The second select statement is returning the records that do not meet or exceed the threshold, and the SpeedingEvent value is N for No. The results of these two select statements are joined with a UNION.p  pKind of odd, but my company wants the ability to also see the speeding events that occurred even though they did not meet the threshold. My problem is that some of those excluded records, those with a SpeedingEvent value of N, do not have a matching record in the dataset where the SpeedingEvent  Y and where the Date and Fleet number are a match.p  pSo, when my SSRS report is generated I am seeing these rows of data that are excluded but dont have any relationship with an existing record that does meet the threshold.p  pI have tried creating a subquery, but that is not working as I am getting an error message stating that the subquery returned more than 1 value and it is not permitted when using certain comparison values.p  pHere is a sample of my code.

Negative 8097 pWhat is the best way to generate a Unique ID from two or more short ints in C  I am trying to uniquely identify vertices in a graph.  The vertices contain two to four short ints as data, and ideally the ID would be some kind of a hash of them.  Prefer portability and uniqueness over speed or ease.  p  pThere are a lot of great answers here, I will be trying them all tonight to see what fits my problem the best.  A few more words on what Im doing.  p  pThe graph is a collection of samples from an audio file.   I use the graph as a Markov Chain to generate a new audio file from the old file.  Since each vertex stores a few samples and points to another sample, and the samples are all short ints, it seemed natural to generate an ID from the data.  Combining them into a long long sounds good, but maybe something as simple as just a 0 1 2 3 generateID is all I need.  not sure how much space is necessary to guarantee uniqueness, if each vertex stores 2 16 bit samples, there are 232 possible combinations correct  and so if each vertex stores 4 samples, there are 264 possible combinations  p  pLibrary and platform specific solutions not really relevant to this question.  I dont want anyone else who might compile my program to have to download additional libraries or change the code to suit their OS.  p  pThanks everybody.  p

Negative 8097 pI have a list view with a couple of image buttons on each row. When you click the list row, it launches a new activity.

Negative 8097 pI have a view which I built in Interface builder with a tableview and associated outlets etc, to display a list of items. Clicking on an item brings up the detail of that item.p  pI now want to build a very similar view with a list of the same kinds of items and some additional controls and different behavior on cell selection. In this case, if the user clicks on the item, they will effectively be using that item as a template to create a new item. Or, they can click on a button to create a new item. Aside from this, there is a lot of logic I want to reuse from the original view  for example the items are location dependent, and there is a background thread that updates the location information.p  pIt seems like the natural thing to do would be to subclass the original viewcontroller, and build a second view layout using IB. However, before I embark on this Im wondering if this is possiblerecommended practice Will IB recognise the IBOutlets in the superclass and let me wire them upp
Negative 8097 pIm writing an application for the Maemo platform using pygtk and the rendering speed of the tree view seems to be a problem. Since the application is a media controller Im using transition animations in the UI. These animations slide the controls into view when moving around the UI. The issue with the tree control is that it is slow. p  pJust moving the widget around in the middle of the screen is not that slow but if the cells are being exposed the framerate really drops. What makes this more annoying is that if the only area that is being exposed is the title row with the row labels, the framerate remains under control.p  pJudging by this Im suspecting the GTK tree view is drawing the full cells again each time a single row of pixels is being exposed. Is there a way to somehow force GTK to draw the whole widget into some buffer even if parts of it are off screen and then use the buffer to draw the widget when animatingp  pAlso is there a difference between using Viewport and scrolling that up and using Layout panel and moving the widgets down Id have imagined Viewport is faster but I saw no real difference when I tried both versions.p  pI understand this isnt necessarily what GTK has been created for. Other alternative Ive tried is pygame but Id prefer some higher level implementaion that has widget based event handling built in. Also pygtk has the benefit of running in Windows and a window so development is easier.p

Negative 8097 pIm not very experienced with javascript, jQuery or its plugins but usually I manage. Anyways, my client is building a site and one of its purposes is to pick up news articles from different sites and show the titles in unordered html lists. I dont have access to his code, the news articles load up rather slowmuch after the site has loaded.p  pIm using qTIP and the idea is that once you hover over a news title, it will generate a tooltip. This works fine in my dev environment, because I have dummy titles that are not generated from anywhere.p  pThe problem is that once the client sets the site up in his test environment, the scripts that load the news titles into the lists are so slow, that the qTIPscript loads before there are any elements in the lists. Hence its not aware of any codeltligtcodes to pick up and generate tooltips from.p  pIs there a way make sure that ALL of the news articles are loaded before the tooltipscript   loads I think that a simple delay in loading the script is not very smart because some of the titles seem to take longer to load than others, so the delay would have to be rather long.p

Negative 8097 pI will preface this by stating that I am new to WPF programming and may be making multiple errors. Any insight that can be provided to help me improve in my skills are greatly appreciated.p  pI am working with a WPF application and am looping through a list of objects that contain properties that describe a document that should be built on the fly and automatically printed. I am attempting to display a small grid in the interface that shows the document being built before it is printed. This serves two purposes one, it allows the user to see work being done by the application. Two, it renders the items on the screen so that I can then have something to actually print since WPF appears to not be able to load an image for printing dynamicaly without displaying it on the screen. In my code, I am setting the various elements in the grid and setting the visibility to visible. However, the UI is not updating and the printed document doesnt look as intended since the image never shows up on the screen.p  pHere is the XAML that I have set upp  precodeltGrid xNameLayoutRoot BackgroundBlackgt ltGrid NamepreviewGrid Grid.Row1 Grid.Column1 BackgroundWhite    VisibilityHiddengt ltCanvas NamepageCanvas HorizontalAlignmentCenter VerticalAlignmentCentergt ltGrid NamepageGrid Width163 Height211gt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                     ltColumnDefinition Width81.5gtltColumnDefinitiongt                     ltColumnDefinition Width81.5gtltColumnDefinitiongt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                 ltTextBlock Grid.Column0 Namecopyright TextAlignmentCenter HorizontalAlignmentCenter VerticalAlignmentBottomgtltTextBlockgt                 ltImage NamepageImage Grid.Column1 HorizontalAlignmentCenter VerticalAlignmentCentergtltImagegt             ltGridgt         ltCanvasgt .....canvas for pages 24 not shown but structure is the same as for pageGrid..... ltGridgt ltGridgt     ltWindowgt codepre  pHere is the code behind that is supposed to set the elements.p  precodeDim bmp as new Bitmapimage previewGrid.Visibility  Windows.Visibility.Visible pageURI  New UripageCollectioni.iamgeURL, UriKind.Absolute             pageGrid.Visibility  Windows.Visibility.Visible             bmp.BeginInit             bmp.UriSource  cardURI             bmp.EndInit             pageImage.Source  bmp             copyright.Text  copyrightText             cardPreviewGrid.UpdateLayout  More code that prints the visual element pageCanvas  previewGrid.Visibility  Windows.Visibility.Hidden codepre  pThe code in codebehind loops through a number of times depending on how many different documents the user prints. Basically it builds a visual element for a page, prints an XPS version of it and then builds the next page and prints it, etc. Once all pages have been processed, the job is actually sent to the printer. The only purpose of this application is to let the user print these documents so there is not other task that they can do in the application while the documents print. I thought that putting this task in a background thread would help to update the UI but since I am trying to manipulate items directly on the UI thread it would appear that this option wont work for me. What am I doing wrong here and how can I improve the code so that I can get the behavior that I am trying to achievep
Negative 8097 pI have an Android application with version 1.6  I take the wallpaper and show it on my application. I do that programatically by calling getWallpaper on the Activityp  pWhen this is installed on a 2.1 phone, that has live wallpaper, the live wallpaper is not returned by getWallpaper , because it just returns a Drawable, and live wallpaper probably is another thing.p  pSo the question is, is it possible to show a live wallpaper on the background of a 1.6 application Howp  pThanksp  pp  pSo far I havent found a solution for this. I am adding this to better understand the questionp  pTo be clear The app is written for 1.6 so it will work on all 1.6 and higher.  The question is can we write an app with 1.6 as the target, but support live wallpapers if its being run on a 2.1 devicep  pThanksp

Negative 8097 pIm trying to decide between two ways of instantiating an object amp handling any constructor exceptions for an object that is critical to my program, i.e. if construction fails the program cant continue.p  pI have a class SimpleMIDIOut that wraps basic Win32 MIDI functions.  It will open a MIDI device in the constructor and close it in the destructor.  It will throw an exception inherited from stdexception in the constructor if the MIDI device cannot be opened.p  pWhich of the following ways of catching constructor exceptions for this object would be more in line with C best practicesp  pMethod 1  Stack allocated object, only in scope inside try blockp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include simplemidiout.h  int main      try              SimpleMIDIOut myOut  constructor will throw if MIDI device cannot be opened         myOut.PlayNote60,100          .....         myOut goes out of scope outside this block         so basically the whole program has to be inside          this block.         On the plus side, its on the stack so          destructor that handles object cleanup         is called automatically, more inline with RAII idiom          catchconst stdexceptionamp e              stdcout ltlt e.what ltlt stdendl         stdcin.ignore         return 1           stdcin.ignore     return 0     codepre  pMethod 2  Pointer to object, heap allocated, nicer structured codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include simplemidiout.h  int main      SimpleMIDIOut myOut      try              myOut  new SimpleMIDIOut          catchconst stdexceptionamp e              stdcout ltlt e.what ltlt stdendl         delete myOut         return 1           myOutgtPlayNote60,100      stdcin.ignore      delete myOut     return 0   codepre  pI like the look of the code in Method 2 better, dont have to jam my whole program into a try block, but Method 1 creates the object on the stack so C manages the objects life time, which is more in tune with RAII philosophy isnt itp  pIm still a novice at this so any feedback on the above is much appreciated.  If theres an even better way to check forhandle constructor failure in a siatuation like this please let me know.p

Negative 8097 pIm designing a larger enterprise architecture and Im in a doubt about how to separate the models and design those. There are several points Id like suggestions for  models to define  way to define modelsp  pCurrently my idea is to definep  ol liCore domain modelli liRepositories to get data to that domain model from a database or other storeli liBusiness logic model that would contain business logic, validation logic and more specific versions of forms of data retrieval methods li liView models prepared for specifically formated data output that would be parsed by views of different kind web, silverlight, etc.li ol  pFor the first model Im puzzled at what to use and how to define the mode. Should this model entities contain collections and in what form IList, IEnumerable or IQueryable collections  Im thinking of immutable collections which IEnumerable is, but Id like to avoid huge data collections and to offer my Business logic layer access with LINQ expressions so that query trees get executed at Data level and retrieve only really required data for situations like the one when Im retrieving a very specific subset of elements amongst thousands or hundreds of thousands.p  pWhat if I have an item with several thousands of bids I cant just make an IEnumerable collection of those on the model and then retrieve an item list in some Repository method or even Business model method. Should it be IQueryable so that I actually pass my queries to Repository all the way from the Business logic model layer Should I just avoid collections in my domain model Should I void only some collectionsp  pShould I separate Domain model and BusinessLogic model or integrate thosep  pData would be dealt trough repositories which would use Domain model classes. Should repositories be used directly using only classes from domain model like data containersp  pThis is an example of what I had in mind img srchttpimg199.imageshack.usimg1997364arch1p.jpg altarchitecture figure 1p  pSo, my Domain objects would look like e.g.p  precodepublic class Item              public string ItemName  get set          public int Price  get set          public bool Available  get set          private IListltBidgt bids         public IQueryableltBidgt Bids                      get  return bids.AsQueryable              private set  bids  value                   public AddNewBidBid newBid                      bids.Addnew Bid ....               codepre  pWhere Bid would be defined as a normal class.p  pRepositories would be defined as data retrieval factories and used to get data into another Business logic model which would again be used to get data to ViewModels which would then be rendered by different consumers.p  pI would define IQueryable interfaces for all aggregating collections to get flexibility and minimize data retrieved from real data store.p  pOr should I make Domain Model anemic with pure data store entities and all collections define for business logic modelp  pOne of the most important questions is, where to have IQueryable typed collections  All the way from Repositories to Business model or not at all and expose only solid IList and IEnumerable from Repositories and deal with more specific queries inside Business model, but have more finer grained methods for data retrieval within Repositories.p  pSo, what do you think Have any suggestionsp

Negative 8097 pstrongThe contextstrongp  pIm actually developing a small web app CMVC2. Users are going to use their iPhones and probably Android phones in the future to access it. p  pAt the moment its quite simple it just shows some info and reports from our customers ERP, and I decided to give a try at creating local webapp that the users could add to their iPhones, so that they had an icon for it and, most importantly, most files are locally cached, so that only the relevant data is obtained using json from the server.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pTo authenticate users, a small form asks for username and password, and sends them to the server via ajax, which in turn validates the user and sets the authcookie. If the app is executed in Safari, everything works ok, but if its executed locally that is, in Mobile Safari directly from an icon, the server validates correctly the user, but this validation is lost when the next ajax call to recover data is made.p  pDoes this mean that session cookies are not supported by Mobile Safari in webapps Im doing it wrong p  pAnd most importantly emWhats the best way to authenticate users in a local webapp that access remote dataemp

Negative 8097 pI just watched a hrefhttpcode.google.comintleneventsio2010sessionsbatchdataprocessingappengine.html relnofollowBatch data processing with App Engine session of Google IO 2010a, read some parts of a hrefhttplabs.google.compapersmapreduce.html relnofollowMapReduce article from Google Researcha and now I am thinking to use a hrefhttpcode.google.compappenginemapreduce relnofollowMapReduce on Google App Enginea to implement a recommender system in Python.p  pI prefer using appenginemapreduce instead of Task Queue API because the former offers easy iteration over all instances of some kind, automatic batching, automatic task chaining, etc. The problem is my recommender system needs to calculate correlation between instances of two different Models, i.e., instances of two distinct kinds.p  pExample I have these two Models User and Item. Each one has a list of tags as an attribute. Below are the functions to calculate correlation between users and items. Note that codecalculateCorrelationcode should be called for every combination of users and itemsp  precodedef calculateCorrelationuser, item     return calculateCorrelationAverageu.tags, i.tags  def calculateCorrelationAveragetags1, tags2     correlationSum  0.0     for tag1, tag2 in allCombinationstags1, tags2         correlationSum  correlationtag1, tag2     return correlationSum  lentags1  lentags2  def allCombinationslist1, list2     combinations  []     for x in list1         for y in list2             combinations.appendx, y     return combinations              codepre  pBut that codecalculateCorrelationcode is not a valid Mapper in appenginemapreduce and maybe this function is not even compatible with MapReduce computation concept. Yet, I need to be sure... it would be really great for me having those appenginemapreduce advantages like automatic batching and task chaining.p  pstrongIs there any solution for thatstrongp  pstrongShould I define my own InputReaderstrong A new InputReader that reads all instances of two different kinds is compatible with the current appenginemapreduce implementationp  pstrongOr should I try the followingstrongp  ul liCombine all keys of all entities of these two kinds, two by two, into instances of a new Model possibly using MapReduceli liIterate using mappers over instances of this new Modelli liFor each instance, use keys inside it to get the two entities of different kinds and calculate the correlation between them. li ul

Negative 8097 pSo I followed a tutorial which allows me to subclass UIToolbar and draw an image as a custom background for the UIToolbar.p  pCode was something like thisp  precode Only override drawRect if you perform custom drawing.

Basically something like em[UIColor blackColor]em, is there an easier way to do this in the drawRect method p  pHaving to make a 320 x 44 px height flat black background image and use that with the above code seems like extreme overhead when em[UIColor blackColor]em is available Im just not sure how to implement it here.p  pI thought about doing something like this insteadp  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect    UIView test  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0,0,self.frame.size.width,self.frame.size.height]    test.backgroundColor  [UIColor blackColor]   [self addSubviewtest]  codepre  pBut this doesnt work because then the UIView strongCOVERSstrong all the UIToolbar items that I add later i.e the Toolbar is black yes, but the black is overtop all the toolbar items so they are not visible. p  pIs there a workaroundp  pThanks.p

Negative 8097 pIm looking to write a small clientserverbased text game that handles multiple client connections and persistently affects a game state. Im wondering what the best way would be to handle multiple connects such that commands are processed in the order they arrive at the server.p  pIdeally Im not looking to take advantage of multithreading, at least on the command processing level. I would be okay with each client having a separate thread in order to have blocking IO on each thread, as long as I could unify the processing in a single thread thereafter.p  pSince the only communication between the client and server will be text, Im not sure how best to go about setting up the communication. If I chose blocking IO, how would I get queue the processing to occur in a single threadp  pAlternatively, if I choose nonblocking IO and use a selector to query for when clients have written to the server, how can I get read a String of unknownunlimited length without using a setsize ByteBuffer Nonblocking also favours keeping the processing in a single thread as it can just read from the client connections as and when they send new data. However, when I tried to implement it with readwriteUTF I came up against the IllegalBlockingModeException heh.p  pAny answers to the questions or suggestions on how to do this in a way I havent mentioned would be sincerely appreciated Im fairly new to clients and servers so I dont know whether java.io or java.nio would be most appropriate.p  pSorry for the convoluted question. I think I ran away with myself.p

Negative 8097 pCan someone please suggest a design approach that would allow my Cocoa app Ill call it MyApp here to create a schedule to relaunch itself regularly and perform some longrunning tasks  Below are ideas Ive thought of so far.  Im new to ObjectiveC, Cocoa and Max OS X so I dont know how difficult or feasible each of the options are.p  olliMyApp programmatically creates an strongAutomatorstrong workflow to launch MyApp. MyApp then programmatically creates an strongiCalstrong repeating event that runs that Automator workflow.  I dont know if this is possible but it does sound like a lot of code and prone to error. It also makes it very easy for the user simply to delete the iCal event, which means that MyApp would have to be able to deal with that use case.li liMyApp programmatically creates a stronglaunchdstrong item.  However, I read that Launchd cannot launch a Cocoa app with a GUI e.g. a hrefhttplists.apple.comarchivescocoadev2006Julmsg01893.html relnofollowlaunchd and Cocoa appsa. This presents a problems in that the user emshouldem be able to see a GUI so that heshe can choose to cancelclose the task. Im guessing that one way around this would be for launchd to run a daemon that then launches MyAppli liInstead of the daemon opening MyApp, the daemon actually has the logic to run the task itself. I would factor out some of the tasks in MyApp into a framework. MyApp would use this framework. I would create a command line tool that uses the same framework, and launchd would call this command line tool. However, having no GUI would be a problem. Also, the command line tool would need access to the same Core Data repository that MyApp uses, and I think each Core Data repository is private to the application for which it was createdli ol  pThe schedule must be created automagically for each unique user of the application.  For example, popping up a message asking the user to create the iCal item would not be acceptable.p  pIf the user uninstalls MyApp, I need the ability for the schedule or schedulestrongemsemstrong, if more than one user has an account in MyApp to be cleaned up.p

Negative 8097 pI am programming a Javascript game as an exercise in objects and AJAX.  It involves movement of wessels around a nauticalthemed grid.  Although the wessels are in an array of objects, I need to manipulate their graphical representation, their sprites.  At the moment I have chosen, from a DOM perspective, to use img elements within td elements. From a UI continuity perspective, which method of programmatically moving the elements with Javascript would be recommendedbr a deleting inner html of from cell td element and rewriting inner html of to cell,br b clone the img node sprite, delete the original node from its parent, and append it to the to cell, orbr c using positioning relative to the table element for the sprite, ignoring the tds alltogether although their background [color] represents the ocean depth.p

Negative 8097 pFor some reason I just cant seem to get my head around the process of creating a CArray instance variable for a class that can have elements added to it dynamically at runtime.p  pMy goal is to create a class called codeAEMeshcode. All codeAEMeshcode objects will have a carray storing the vertexdata for that specific codeAEMeshcodes 3D model for use with OpenGL ES more specifically its functionality for drawing a model by passing it a simple CArray of vertexdata.p  pInitially I was using an codeNSMutableArraycode, on the assumption that I could simply pass this array to OpenGL ES, however that isnt the case as the framework requires a CArray. I got around the issue by essentially creating a CArray of all of the vertexdata for the current codeAEMeshcode when it came time to render that specific mesh, and passing that array to OpenGL ES. Obviously the issue here is performance as I am constantly allocating and deallocating enough memory to hold every 3D models vertexdata in the app about a dozen times a second.p  pSo, Im not one to want the answer spoon fed to me, but if anyone would be willing to explain to me the standard idiom for giving a class a mutable carray some articles Ive read mention using codemalloccode I would greatly appreciate it. From the information Ive gathered, using malloc might work, but this isnt creating a standard carray I can pass in to OpenGL ES, instead its more of a pseudocarray that works like a carrayp  pAnyways, I will continue to experiment and search the internet but again, if anyone can offer a helping hand I would greatly appreciate it.p  pThanks,   Adam Eisfeldp

Negative 8097 phope that title makes sense. Im a noob at javascript. What I want to do is have a form which will have a couple of inputs like, name and url for example. p  pWhen the user enters their name, Id like the url input to automatically have as a default their name with an underscore between words. So if they type in as their name pedro kinkybottom then automatically set as the default in the url input would be pedrokinkybottom.p  pIm using cakephp if anyone happens to know a particularly cakey way to do this thatd be cool but otherwise any help at all would be most welcome.p  pThanks,p  pPedro p
Negative 8097 pIm building a really simple Core Data app in XCode 4. Theres an entity model with just one entity Employee and just one attribute name.p  pIn IB Ive added a default Table View to display the employees, two buttons one to add an employee and another to delete an employee and an ArrayController.p  pIt is my understanding that the ArrayControllers managedObjectContext somehow needs to be connected to the one that is initialised by the App Delegate.

Negative 8097 pThere are a lot of cool tools for making powerful singlepage JavaScript websites nowadays. In my opinion, this is done right by letting the server act as an API and nothing more and letting the client handle all of the HTML generation stuff. The problem with this pattern is the lack of search engine support. I can think of two solutionsp  ol liWhen the user enters the website, let the server render the page exactly as the client would upon navigation. So if I go to codehttpexample.commypathcode directly the server would render the same thing as the client would if I go to codemypathcode through pushState.li liLet the server provide a special website only for the search engine bots. If a normal user visits codehttpexample.commypathcode the server should give him a JavaScript heavy version of the website. But if the Google bot visits, the server should give it some minimal HTML with the content I want Google to index.li ol  pThe first solution is discussed further a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6193858pushstateandseoherea. I have been working on a website doing this and its not a very nice experience. Its not DRY and in my case I had to use two different template engines for the client and the server.p  pI think I have seen the second solution for some good ol Flash websites. I like this approach much more than the first one and with the right tool on the server it could be done  quite painlessly.p  pSo what Im really wondering is the followingp  ul liCan you think of any better solutionli liWhat are the disadvantages with the second solution If Google in some way finds out that Im not serving the exact same content for the Google bot as a regular user, would I then be punished in the search resultsli ul

Negative 8097 pIm designing the UI with IB with a lot of images, and the default design orientation is landscape. However, I need to shrink the whole view to fit in portrait mode, by shrinking to the maximum allowed width and maintaining same aspect ratio for the view with its inner images. The best way to imagine what I want to achieve is to imagine some landscape photo. When you rotate that to portrait it shrinks to the maximum width, centers vertically, but maintains the same aspect ratio. In my case, I want to shrink a view with its all inner subviews. p  pFirst, Im manually resizing view frame to required size in viewWillApppear, and also calling setAutoresizesSubviews to resize all its inner views. Those inner views  images are with Aspect Fit and all autosizing options set to fill the available area on resized view. However, inner views pops out of the container some images jumps to the top, text view expands to full portrait height. Is possible to set some kind of viewcontainer, then say  view resize to size X and resize all your but only inside viewcontainer area      p

Negative 8097 pI have tried using Blowfish CBC technique for encrypting  decrypting a text from PHP to Flash.

So for example, if we have the original text as without quotations stackoverflow and the key as 123456, the output will be base64p  pMUXl8mBS9OsvxTbLAiCrAMp851L8vVD0p  pTill now there is no problem.

Negative 8097 pI am trying to compare two PHP projects using PHP Depend httppdepend.org. One is a pagebased PHP application written by a group of students a year ago and the second is mine that I have worked on for the past year. The objective is  to provide some quantitative statistics that might help validate that refactoring the project introducing a MVC architecture and lots of refactoring to better apply OO principles has led to lower complexity and coupling, among others. p  pThe problem I am facing is that when analyzing the older project, PHP depend ignores the files that were written in a procedural programming style. It only picks up those files that have classes defined. I am not sure why the previous students chose to have this hybrid style of writing code but they did. p  pIs this how PHP Depend works or is there some setting I can use so that it analyzes all files. The site offers little help. If PHP Depend can only analyze files with defined classes and methods, how can I generate some code metrics to validate my projectp

AnkhSVN is installed within my VS 2010 setup. VSAnkhSVN can talk to my repository. So I started experimenting with some very simple Console projects to get started. I created the trunk, branches, and tags directories as suggested in the guidance Ive found so far. p  pI created a new Console solution, and allowed Ankh to create that project in my repository under the recommended trunk folder. After adding nothing more than a Hello, World line to Program.cs, I commit the changes to trunk. That works...so far, so good...p  pIm now wanting to pretend Im working on a private branch, so I select SubversionBranch Project... from trunk and the HeadLatest version, checking Switch to Branch after creation. That seems to go well.p  pstrongProblem 1.strongp  pNow heres where things get dicey. I decide to add a single source file to the project in my private branch, adding the file, but I cannot get the file to move from my private branch to trunk. Mergingreintegrate doesnt work. Update doesnt work. Switch doesnt work. Now, after trying a switch from the branch to the trunk, VS tells me my project file is corrupt and cant be loaded. p  pObviously, Ive done something terribly wrong, but I dont know what. It appears I just need to get a trunk working copy, then do a merge, but how do I do that in my VS project folder setup p  pstrongProblem 2strongp  pMy next problem, or question, which may be part of Problem 1, is understanding how Subversionmanaged projects should be structured on the Visual Studio side. Its much clearer to me on the Unix side that you can pull a project into a local folder, but its not at all clear how the typical directory structure of a VS project is supposed to be affected by Subversion. Should the trunk and branches folders be duplicated on the local Visual Studio box as well If I switch from trunk to a private branch or viceversa, is the intent that the corresponding files should be going into the same set of VS folders, or should there be a corresponding set for the branches and for the trunkp  pstrongProblem 3strong This is more of a newbie SVN question, but when SVN tells me there are conflicts, I dont yet understand how to resolve them. Does the ankhSVN plugin have special tools to resolve conflicts, or do I need to fix them on the host server with the full svn tool If so, whats is the most typical kind of conflict to resolve p

I followed some advice in another thread, and changed it to Game, which did not work, so I have changed it back.p  pI authenticate my web app user with facebook and receive a code, which I then trade in for an codeaccesstokencode, pretty standard. I ask for the following permissionsp  ul licodepublishstreamcodeli licodepublishactionscodeli licodeofflineaccesscodeli ul  pHowever, when I attempt to make a call to publish an action, I receive an OAuthException, and have no real way of debugging it.p  pSome odditiesp  ul liThe graph API doesnt seem to like the URL format specified in the documentation codeme[appnamespace][actiontype]code. In my case, this would be codeme . FBAPPNAMESPACE . readcode, where FBAPPNAMESPACE is defined earlier to be a namespace as defined in the facebook application settings. Both the API and the Graph API Explorer throw an error stating that it doesnt understand the action given. It seems to be trying to read the namespace as the action.li liIf I remove the namespace from the url, it reports that the passed in action doesnt match the codeogtypecode defined in the url, since the codeogtypecode in the url contains the same namespace I removed.li liIf I remove emthatem namespace from the meta tag, and try again, I get a generic OAuthException that I cant debug.li liWhen I look at the code sample provided in my facebook app, the action seems to be codenews.readscode instead of just codereadcode.li liIf I use that action, the graph API returns an error saying that my ID is unauthorized to use the open graph, as it is not an admin, dev, or tester for my application. Unfortunately, I am the app creator, which means either the graph API is lying, or I am lying to myselfli ul  pI think the solution is pretty simple  perhaps I have forgotten something, or selected a certain category incorrect. Either way, this is a little frustrating, to say the leastp

Negative 8097 pI have been reading about hashcode functions for the past couple of hours and have accumulated a couple of questions regarding use of prime numbers as multipliers in custom hashcode implementations. I would be grateful if I could get some insight regarding following questionsp  ul lipIn a comment to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma299748328725mattbs answera here, hstoerr advocates for use of larger primes such as 524287 instead of the common prime 31. My question is, given the following implementation of a hashcode functions for a pair or elements p  precodeOverride public int hashCode      final int prime  31     int hash1  pg1  null  0  pg1.hashCode     int hash2  pg2  null  0  pg2.hashCode     return prime  hash1  hash2  codepreli ul  pdoesnt this lead to an overflow on the returned codeintcode if codeprimecode is a large number p  ul lipAssuming that the overflow is not a problem JVM doing an automatic cast is it better to do a bitshift instead of a cast pli lipI imagine the performance of the hashcode function vary significantly based on the complexity of the hashcode. Does the size of the prime multiplier not effect the performancepli lipIs it bettersmarterfaster to use multiple primes in a custom hashcode function instead of a single multiplier If not, is there some other advantage See the example below from jinguys answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq4442136328725a relevant questiona p  precodepublic int hashCode      return a  13  b.hashCode  23  c 31 7  codepreli ul  pwhere codeacode is an codeintcode, codebcode is a codeStringcode and codeccode is codebooleancode.p  ul liHow about something like codelong lhash  prime  hash1  hash2code then using codeintlhash gtgt 32  lhashcode Thats something I saw on another question here SO, but it wasnt really explained why it was a good idea to do it like that.li ul

Negative 8097 pAs I understand if you declare a column as codevarchar15code or codevarchar200code, it makes no difference in memory size. If you store a 4character string it should only use around 4 bytes. This is the same in Oracle for varchar2. But, for Oracle, their performance are different as the bigger size you set, the more overhead will be used. p  pIs it the same in MySQL or any other databasep

Negative 8097 pA while back, I noticed that VLC has the ability to play videos directly on the desktop. When I did so at my school, on Windows XP, it played underneath the icons. When I tried at home, on Windows 7, it hid the icons. Im not sure if its the operating system or if its an update of VLC, but Im interested in playing it underneath the icons.p  pAfter noticing this, I had an idea to make an animated desktop of sorts. Nothing special, just a few select videos for my own use. The idea I started with was to play a video in my own window using codemciSendStringcode and do a codePrintWindowcode of each frame, save it to a file, and set the desktop wallpaper as the file. Ive since lost the specific code, but it wasnt quite working, and, needless to say, would perform horribly. p  pComing back to it, I realized there must be a much more efficient way than that anyway, but I cant quite grasp what that is. p  pI tried all in Windows 7 now setting the videos parent window to codeGetDesktopWindowcode, to the effect of minimizing all windows leaving behind a new window on the taskbar playing the video, but being able to see the desktop through clicking the aero peek button or hitting WinD.p  pI then tried the same with a parent window of the desktops folder view window. The result was the same dimensioned window playing the video, but this time, the desktop could not be accessed, and no new window was created. Its like it was playing over top of most of the desktop, but the gadgets go over top and the areas toward the right and bottom still show due to the smaller playing window size. p  pWhat does VLC do to play it on the desktop itself, looking as if its a dynamic wallpaper Is it significantly harder to make it play underneath the icons and gadgets if you add in Windows 7, I suppose The program itself will be used on Windows XP. Im not sure if DirectShow has anything that might help, but Im willing to use it, among other Windows API areas besides just MCI. Id prefer the solution to be in C, if it makes a difference. .NET would also work well, but might take a bit of extra time working in.p

Negative 8097 pThe Problem There is a method with a corresponding testcase that works on one machine and fails on the other details below. I assume theres something wrong with the code, causing it to work by chance on the one machine. Unfortunately I cannot find the problem.p  pPlease note that the usage of stdstring and utf8 encoding are requirements I have no real influence on. Using C methods would be totally fine, but unfortunately I failed to find anything. Hence the use of Cfunctions.p  pThe methodp  precodestdstring firstCharToUpperUtf8const stringamp orig    stdstring retVal   retVal.reserveorig.size   stdmbstatet state  stdmbstatet   char buf[MBCURMAX  1]   sizet i  0   if orig.size gt 0      if orig[i] gt 0        retVal  toupperorig[i]       i      else        wchart wChar       int len  mbrtowcampwChar, amporig[i], MBCURMAX, ampstate        If this assertion fails, there is an invalid multibyte character.

They however use different versions of libc. It works on the machine with GLIBC2.14 independent of where it was compiled and doesnt work on the other machine, while it can only be compiled there, because otherwise it lacks the proper libc version.p  pEither way, there is a machine that compiles this code and runs it while it fails. There has to be something wrong with the code and I wonder what. Pointing to C methods STL in particular, would also be great. Boost and other libraries should be avoided due to other outside requirements.p

Negative 8097 pIve been running around the web for a while now looking for a solution to this problem, but Im quite disheartened by now to find something that will fit all of my requirements. So here goes.p  pIm trying to build a desktop application that uses the Kinect for Windows sensor to control a visualization of digital library as in, the place you go to for books assets. Im quite versed in using the official MS Kinect SDK and already have a neat utility framework for prototyping at hand, so Id obviously love to make use of it. This plus the desktop app theme of things says the whole shebang will need to be in C, which is fine by me.p  pOn the other hand, the visualization part already exists and looks gorgeous, but its JavaScript and specifically, JIT i.e. javascript infovis toolkit. It has all the bells and whistles I need and its neatly animated. Also, Im a noob at JavaScript.p  pThe point is, how do I avoid rewriting either one into the others language while still allowing them to talk at runtimep  pSo, do you know any way to either BR A embed a JIT visualization e.g. radial tree visualization in a windows application in a way that allows me to manipulate the graph at runtime from a C class e.g. selecting a new node to be animated into focus or BR B send C events to JS to react to gesture input at runtime Is this something ASP.NET can dop  pI have a feeling the result will be a weird mix of desktop and web technology, but any pointers to the right sort of technology is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8097 pI have a MatLab script that I would like to use in my Javascript algorithm.

Ideally, I would like to use my JavaScript as it currently works to spit a string of a specified format into a MatLab script directly and access its string output after that algorithm is done.p  pWhat are the ways in which I can do this  If there is only the .NET or similar approach, does anyone have good resources to guide how to do this carefully or even better, personal experience with how to set this upp  pThank you in advance.p  pstrongRevisit NOTE Dec 17, 2013 amp Decision Madestrong  It turns out that in the end it proved easier to just recode my MatLab script into JavaScript.  Google Closure was released for JavaScript a while ago, and it provides a beautiful bit of extended functionality to the JavaScript language, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in using it.  I particularly made use of its Matrix library, which allowed me to recode amp design my Nodal Voltage Analysis method in JavaScript.

Negative 8097 pIn a survey framework, where user input ie asking survey questions, not answering them is fairly trusted, my predecessor went with building a MySQL query pretty much straight from userdefined constraints ie without doing much about the possibility of malicious SQL injection, since SQL injection was the intended result.p  pIn most cases these constraints would be something like skip this question if codesex  1code which would then translate into a query like p  pcodeSELECT IFsex  1 AS test FROM Survey1 WHERE userid  12codep  pIn more complex cases the constraint might bebr codeSurvey1.agreed  1 OR Survey2.age lt 50 AND Survey2.age gt 18 OR Survey3.numberofchildren IN2,3,5,7code  where he would have to build joins etc. to support unlimited complexity and nesting. p  pObviously, there are many ways in which letting users pretty much specify the WHERE part of a query can go wrong, even if malicious users are rare.br He tried parsing these constraints himself, but with the complex cases this performed so badly, that in the end he went with the unsafe but fast approach.p  pWhat could be a safe, somewhat performant solution to this problemp
Negative 8097 pIn my project i have to run multiinterfaces at a time. I used isMdicontainer property. But problem is whole area is converted to MDI.

How can i introduce that into my project for switching between forms. I am using VS 2010, Doing project in CWin forms, net framework 3.5p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 8097 pI have a Winforms project A, that references a class library assembly B. Assembly B has folders containing files that are set to strongBuild Action  Nonestrong and strongCopy to Output Directory  Truestrong. These folders and files are correctly output to the bin folder of assembly B. They are not referenced files, merely ones I need to load at runtime from the deployed location.p  pWhen running project A, code in assembly B needs to access the folders and files described.  strongAppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectorystrong will give me the running location of project A, but the folders and files do not exist at that location. How do I locate these files in C code from assembly Bp  pAssembly B gets compiled into various solution types winforms, web services, etc, so I need a deployment that will work in all scenarios.p  pI hope that makes sense I guess Im looking for a a change to the way it gets to deployed so that the folders and files are also in the running directory, or b a change to the code in assembly B.p  pI would be grateful for any helpp

Negative 8097 pIm trying to create a lucene index for a model partly consisting of abstract classes. Lets say I want to index class A, which has a method to return a list of class B elements, which all has a object of abstract class C which has an abstract method getD to return a list of class D elements. Class E and F extend class C and both implement method getD, for which I created a FieldBridge implementation implements StringBridge to convert to result into text output to be used for the index.p  pThe Hibernate search documentation is not very elaborate on how to deal with inheritance and how they can be used together with the IndexedEmbedded annotation. I tried the naive approach of just providing c.getD as includePath, hoping that the getD implementations of the subclasses of c would automatically be used.

Negative 8097 pIm working in an Android application to collect data through forms... So, I have two important dates to synchronize the data collected to my server a Period of Synchronization, which takes values like WEEKLY, MONTHLY, etc... and b Date of Campaign Finalization, which takes also the values WEEKLY, MONTHLY, etc but it also can take values specified by the user... however, b must be higher or equal to a...A campaign can have several periods of synchronization...p  pSo, to a, if its value is WEEKLY, I have to take the system date and then calculate the date 7 days forward... For b I always have the date specified... When a is reached, then the app must synchronize the data collected and forbid the edition of the forms or delete the data collected if specified... When b is reached, then the app must synchronize the data collected and delete them on purpose... If a is higher than b as a result of date calculation, a has to take the same value than b and the event related to b is triggered...p  pWhat I want to do now is to schedule two task one for a and one for b. This procedures have to be activated once the devices operator synchronizes for the first time data from the server. And they must executed in background, because they do a HTTP connection.p  pCan anyone guide me through this Which is the best way to do this I have read a lot about AlarmManager but all the examples I read are too simple and for notifications... Please help Is kind of urgentp

In that SP i store the result of a long query in a temp table, name the columns and make another queries on that table store the results in labels or a gridview or whatever and drop the Temp Table. I could also store the queryresult in a view and make queries on that view.

Negative 8097 pIve done a lot of reading about latency of azure database on stackoverflow and various blogs around the web.  I cannot figure out what is going on, however, with the high latency Im experiencing between my azure website and azure database.p  pI notice my app was running very slow so I clocked the time to run a query the query themselves take 0ms for the db to execute.  On average, it is taking 175ms to execute a query and get a response from the db.

Negative 8097 pSo Im not even sure how to word this. I am trying to validate form data with a JSON Schema. I use Dojo to create the form and fetch its contents when the user clicks submits. However all the data in the form are returned as strings. Thus when my schema finds a field that should be a number it throws an error because it is technically a string even if the input is 123. Is there a way to get form data while preserving its primitive typep  precodearray.forEachformData, functionitem      postData[Stringitem.title]  domAttr.getitem, value  codepre  pAny ideasp

Negative 8097 pI have a div and inside my div I have a dojo dijit.layout.BorderContainer. Inside that border container I have 2 more more BorderContainers and finally each of those border containers has one more BorderContainer.p  pThe base div is made movable with dojo.dnd.movable. This works fine and I can move my div about my screen properly. My problem arises in the most nested BorderContaienrs. Each of these contains many buttons and have the overflowauto. When I grab the scroll bar to scroll down to see more of my buttons the scroll bar doesnt work. Instead when I grab the scroll bar and move it downup it drags the entire div around the screen. I have checked the zindex and the scroll bar is most certainly above the div.p  pHere is the hierarchy  divBorderContainerBorderContainerBordercontainerwith scroll barp

Negative 8097 pJquery mobile panel has to be included in a page element, as a sibling of header and footer. I  want to use the panel as a menu to switch between different pages, so I include the same panel in every page. It works fine except one thing when switching to a new page, the page is shown with the panel closed. I want the panel to slide back while new page is loaded, like in most mobile native apps.p  pI know this is possible, because JQM has persistent headers and footers, with multiple pages containing similar headersfooters, but they dont flicker when loading a new page.p  pSo my question is Does JQM support a persistent panel If it doesnt, is there any easy way to implement this without modifying code in JQM itselfp

I am using some methods I created for an assignment to deal with the data, and have one of them working on the data in the following example, I cant show the methods because its homework that isnt due yet. The methods have been tested and work fine, so no need for them in this question. So far, either the text area will show up in the GUI, but not have the scroll pane attached to it, or only the jlabel will show up with the results of the work done via the method.

This list has gotten rather long and I would like to remove listed branches without actually deleting them or the remote so if I do want them back in the future it wont require me readding the repo.p

Negative 8097 pI am currently trying to to write a method that uses another method which in turn creates a new object from another class constructor. But I am somehow not able to get the object that I created. When I try to print the object in the method that used the method which creates the object it tells me the object is undefined. I am  confused over how I should solve this problem. The reason I have this other method is because there is a bit too much code in one place, so I tried to make it cleaner.  Anyhow, I decided to post two codes. The first one is my try on making it shorter and easier for you guys to read. But perhaps, just perhaps it might not have something that I missed in my original code. So I am posting that and my constructor class as well. Hopefully it fits here Any help would be greatly appreciatedp  pHere is the first example sample of what I am trying to do p  precodepublic static void GameStart The print method      if Player1         playerVljKorttrue         int val  readIntSpara val  1nRedigera val  2         if val  2                             This is where I am trying to print the object. Ive tried doing this in several ways.             System.out.printlnplayer1Kortlek                 public static void playerVljKortboolean playerTurn            I fail to define this outside the method.

Negative 8097 pI have to develop a C program for an embedded FriendlyARMbased processor system. I use Qt Creator 3.0.0 based on Qt 5.2.0 for desktop computer.

Negative 8097 pIve tried a lot of different ways, most of the suggestions found here, but none of them seems to work. What Im trying to achieve is at chat area below my game area, a SurfaceView. It is supposed to scroll upwards as new lines are added to the textview.p  pAt first, it looks like a really simple task, but having tried all kinds of suggestions, like a TextView in a ScrollView, like a TextView in a TableRow in a TableLayout in a ScrollView, and so on...Ive still not made it happen. Of course this must be something easily achieved in Android, rightp  pThe task is to display like 6 lines of text in the bottom of the screen, and as a new message is added last it should scroll the rest upwards, like a terminal window. The important thing is that it should add the latest message after the other and, when reached the bottom line, scroll the text upwards and add the new lines at the end.p  pAny kind of help or suggestions would be highly appreciatedp

Negative 8097 pIm using requirechildprocess.spawn and calling an executable, which at the beginning is pausing for a password to be input if I use it like belowp  precodevar spawn  requirechildprocess.spawn var exe  spawnNameOfExe.exe, [arguments], stdio [process.stdin, process.stdout, process.stderr] codepre  pIt works perfectly Yes, I know I can do inherit, shush p . I can type inside my console and itll accept it with no issues.p  pHowever, if I do it like thisp  precodevar spawn  requirechildprocess.spawn var exe  spawnNameOfExe.exe, [arguments], stdio [pipe, process.stdout, process.stderr] exe.stdin.writePasswordn codepre  pthen the executable doesnt even receive the stdin it immediately goes to Execution Failed.p  pIm completely at a loss for this. Any suggestionsp  pEDITp  pI think I may be onto somethingp  pSo Im 99.99 certain that the executable is using C and Console.ReadKey to get the password.

Negative 8097 pI got access to the server of my lab yesterday. I was trying to do some scientific computing on it with Numpy or so.p  pThe problem is that the server has a SuSE linuxI never heard of such thing.. installed, and its very difficult to install anything on it. So the administrator suggested that I should set my python environment locally since I didt have root access.p  pI have checked the default python interpreter on the server, it has python2.6 and python3.x. But I wish to use python2.7.x.p  pI followed some instructions to install python2.7 into codehomekevin.localcode with something like thisp  precode.configure prefixhomekevin.local codepre  pIt works, but not easy, because I have to typep  precodehomekevin.localbinpython codepre  peverytime.p  pSo, here is my question what should I do to set the python2.7 I have installed locally as my default python evironment, so I can usep  precodepython test.py codepre  pto run my script. And when I use codepipcode, it will install modules locally automatically.p  pps I have went through many of the threads available out there, but they only covers how to install modules locally. So I dont think they meet my purpose. And I also tried codevirtualenvcode. As I mentioned before, the default python version is 2.6 in codeusrbinpythoncode, so I can only get a python2.6 virtual environment locally, which is not what I want.p  pSince English is my second language, Im not sure whether I have got everything clear. If not, please point out. It would be very kind of you to do so. And thanks for helpp

Negative 8097 pIm trying to create a GUI application that makes use of a class called Chameleon. Within the class, there are three instance variables, Length, Name and Color.  Length is a double, Name and Color are strings.p  pI need to overload the constructor of Chameleon.  A new Chameleon object can be created 1. with the length and name,  2. with the name and color, or 3. with the length, name and color specified.  The constructor should place a message with information about the Chameleon that was just created into a public instance variable.p  pThe GUI should allow the user to enter the length if it is specified the valid length is from 0.1 to 10.2 inches, the name must not be empty and the color if it is specified it must be one of green, orange, brown, black, yellow, or red.p  pWhen the user presses an OK button a Chameleon object is created using only the arguments for which the user has specified a value. After that the public instance variable containing the message must be displayed in a label from the OK buttons click procedure.p  pI have very little experience with GUI applications and I am completely lost here. Any help at all to at least get me started would be much appreciated.

Primarily I want calling tree profiling, that is if a calls b and then b calls c, then how much time a b and c took, both inclusively and exclusively.p  pHave seen codejvisualvmcode and codejprofilercode, but this is not what I am looking for, because I cannot tie my production application to them as it will cause a major performance issue.p  pAlso, I did go through codemetricscode a hrefhttpsgithub.comdropwizardmetrics relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdropwizardmetricsa, but it does not give me a functionality to profile the calling tree.p  pcodeCallgrindcode a hrefhttpvalgrind.orgdocsmanualclmanual.html relnofollowhttpvalgrind.orgdocsmanualclmanual.htmla type library is what I need, as it gives calling tree profiling functionality and advanced options like avoiding calling cycles recursion. But I am not sure that Callgrind can be used on production as it dumps data when program terminates.p  pCan anyone suggest good calling tree profiler for java that can be used on production without compromising the performancep

Specifically, I am doing OAuth 2.0 authentication with a hosted service, and I want to send the user to the authentication page hosted in a WebView and return the code for requesting access tokens if the operation is successful or throw an exception if the user does not authorize my application.p  pFor examplep  precodevar authentication  new AuthenticationAccess  string code  await authentication.RequestAuthorizationAsync codepre  pThe call would swap out the Page in the Frame with the Page containing the WebViews, the user would be able to authenticate and then control would return back to the calling function and the page swapped back to the original page.p  pIm kind of swimming in Windows 8.1 CXAML documentation. From what I understand, there is a global Window object that hosts a Frame object which can have its content swapped out with the different Pages in the application. Having done some Android development, Im familiar with the Activity model, where essentially different pages can be initiated through intents and can propagate results back up to the Activity which launched it. With this model, it seems like it would be easy to wrap this process in the model I described, but Im a little confused of how to do the same thing in Windows. Would I need to stand up significant architecture to achieve this patternp  pIs there a simple answer to this, or am I in over my headp

Negative 8097 pEclipse provides the shortcut Ctrl  Alt  H that opens the Call Hierarchy.  I find this very helpful, however, I often find myself needing to toggle between the Caller Hierarchy, and the Callee Hierarchy.  Is there a way to do this without mouseclicking on the respective iconsp
Negative 8097 pAlright I have a method called nom in the user class and ive not written a decorator before, but basically I need to redirect the user to another URL if they pass this.

Negative 8097 pI recently ran into an interesting bug with a program at work. I would like to know a little bit more about how codeoperator[]code works with maps. Consider the following example codep  precodeinclude ltmapgt include ltiostreamgt include ltutilitygt include lttuplegt  class test      public     testint a, char b          a  a         b  b           void print         stdcout ltlt a ltlt   ltlt b ltlt stdendl           private        int a        char b       int main      stdmapltint, testgt mapper     mapper.emplacestdpiecewiseconstruct,             stdforwardastupleltintgt1,             stdforwardastupleltint, char, doublegt1, c, 2.34     mapper[1].print  codepre  pThe code is very simple, and the objective is pretty clear, I dont want to have a default constructor for the class test. This code wont compile however, because codemapper[1].printcode calls the default constructor. p  pThe obvious solution here is to replace codemapper[1].printcode with codemapper.find1gtsecond.printcode. I am just interested in why it is necessary for mapper[1] to create a codetestcode. Does this mean that every time in any code i have written with a map using codeoperator[]code that it creates a default and copies the class before calling its functionsp  pThis seems like a huge waste of time, i understand its necessity during something like this codemapper[2]  test1, acode. Is there not any way that it could tell that its not part of an codeoperatorcode call I guess not. p

Negative 8097 pIve made a little Towers of Hanoi game, but nothing what was set on my PC looks the same on a different computer, not even the fonts. Everything is so messed up, I couldnt do it better even if I wanted this to happen. To say it short the backgrounds used for controls and forms are out of place, the initial values used for size and position of both forms and controls are bloody changed, and my project just looks like a huge mess. Its true Ive worked in absolute values, because usually a programming language respects the programmers point of view, and doesnt scales and moves everything the way it wants. If I wanted my project to rescale according to screen resolution I would had used relative coordinates, and made all my forms and controls dimensions be a certain amount of the screens width and height.p  pIs there a way to preserve the project just as it was initially designed, so it would look the same on any computerp  pIm using Visual Studio 2010, and Windows 7 as OS.p

Negative 8097 pI am working on a web application built with php and zend framework 2. I come from a Java EE background. It seems to me that for each http request the whole zend application stack is being rebuilt, reading a load of config files from disk, constructing all my services and whatnot. Is this correct If so this seems rather strange and inefficient to me compared to the Java EE approach of having a load of application services that are initialized on web server start up and then have a lifetime across many requests. Seeing as the browser is making lots of little Ajax requests isnt this phpzend approach horribly slow Do I need a paradigm shift in the way I approach web application designp

The only problem is I have a separate Console application as mentioned above which has a heap of classes and functions. In the WPF application an event fires when all sensor information is ready. I want to place my entire Console Application code in the infinite while loop of the WPF project and then use the sensor information to then get the robot to move to certain locations.p  pEssentially what I am asking is where can I place code into the infinite while loop of the WPF Application p  pI think I might be completely misunderstanding how to use WPF applications, any help would be greatly appreciated. p

Then when Save is clicked it would change the State back again only showing the read only TextBlock.  p  pI thought that I could do this with the VisualStateManager but it seems you can only do Storyboards for States and even if I leave the button always there and make it invisible I cant seem to change the Property Value between States either.p  pIs VisualStateManager the answer for this or is there something better to use  p  pstrongUpdatestrong I found and followed this example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3042869wpfagoodwaytomakeavieweditcontrolView  Edit Controla and it looks like it will solve my issue. p  precodeltUserControl xClassWpfApplication1.Test2          xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation          xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml          xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006           xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008           xmlnscclrnamespaceWpfApplication1          mcIgnorabled           dDesignHeight300 dDesignWidth300gt ltGridgt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltRowDefinition gt         ltRowDefinition gt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt     ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt         ltColumnDefinition gt     ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt     ltLabel NameMyTest  cReadOnlyControlTemplate.EnabledTrue cReadOnlyControlTemplate.DoLockFalse Grid.Column0 Grid.Row0 ContentBinding PathMessage  gt          ltControl.Templategt             ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType Labelgt                 ltTextBox WidthTemplateBinding PropertyWidth HeightTemplateBinding PropertyHeight TextBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent, PathContent AcceptsReturnTrue Margin100,0 gt              ltControlTemplategt         ltControl.Templategt         ltcReadOnlyControlTemplate.LockTemplategt             ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType Labelgt                 ltBorder BorderBrushRed BorderThickness3gt                     ltTextBlock WidthTemplateBinding PropertyWidth HeightTemplateBinding PropertyHeight TextBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource TemplatedParent, PathContent ForegroundWhite gt                 ltBordergt             ltControlTemplategt         ltcReadOnlyControlTemplate.LockTemplategt     ltLabelgt     ltWrapPanel Grid.Column0 Grid.Row1 HorizontalAlignmentCentergt         ltButton ContentReadOnly   Width70 Height25 ClickButtonClick Margin0,0,5,0 gt         ltButton ContentEdit  Grid.Column0 Grid.Row1 Width50 Height25 ClickButtonClick2 gt     ltWrapPanelgt ltGridgt codepre  pp
Negative 8097 pThis is probably a newbie question because Im a newbie with Eclipse. Ive got a file in my Eclipse Scala project that imports salat classes using codeimport com.novus.salat.code. Eclipse gives me errors object salat is not a member of package com.novus and object novus is not a member of package com. p  pThe package com.novus.salat is in my src folder in Eclipse, so I dont understand why I get these errors.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com27Yg5.png altmy Eclipse folder treep  pThe com.novus.salat package is linked from a source code folder [path]comnovussalat outside of my Eclipse project directory. I couldnt copy the com folder into my project because the folder com already exists for something else, plus I dont want to do that anyway because I want the salat source code to be easily updatable by updating the git submodule since it was cloned from GitHub. Linking the files instead of copying should work, right Im having the same problem with other packages Im trying to import. What am I doing wrongp

Negative 8097 pI am developing an asp.net 4.5 project as a learning experience.  Server side stuff I have some experience with, but am quite new to jQuery.  I am trying to use an off canvas slider nav menu inside a content panel of a master page not an update panel.  I have left the generic visual studio nav bar across the top for basic login functionality.  I was tinkering with a slidebars tutorial and it works great with the generic about us, home, and contact pages of the default vs 2013 express asp.net 4.5 web application template.  When I try to link to the registerlogin pages from the slider or if I just click them in the default nav bar, the code throws an error stating that 0x800a01b6  JavaScript runtime error Object doesnt support property or method slidebars  I had the same problem earlier trying to do something similar with jQueryaim.  p  pthe basic code for the function call is belowp  precode    ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcslidebarsslidebars.jsgtltscriptgt      ltscriptgt     function           document.readyfunction               .slidebars              jQuery ltscriptgt codepre  pI researched a suggestion from another post about avast security settings in ie but I dont have that installed as an addon.  I tried setting a noconflict statement right before the function code, but had the same problem.  Thought maybe the slidebars.js or css was not loading but why would it work on the nonlogin pages.  I looked at maybe some kind of partial postback issue but the error gets thrown initial loading of the page.

Negative 8097 pI have an app that I am in the process of updating from iOS 7 to 8 and trying to take advantages of the new size classes Apple now offers.

See Image below. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj5ZAt.jpg altenter image description herep  pNow up until this point, all is going well. Xcode is NOT complaining about anything missing. p  pSo up next is the View inside the scrollView which I am using as a container for all the content inside the scrollView. When I try to repeat the process from about I get some constraint warnings.... but why I gave it a constraint on the top right left and bottom, why is that not enough for Xcode to know how why and tall it should be. It seems that is wants a width and height for the view as well. Buy if I set the width, then it assumes the width of 600 which is much too wide for any iPhone. p  pIm sure my thinking is not correct somewhere.. i just dont know where and why. I truly want to understand how this system works, so any insight be would helpfulp  pThanksp  p Update p  pHere is what the inspector looks like img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comU9yNz.png altenter image description herep  pAnd here is what Xcode is complaining about  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comp7ngP.png altenter image description herep

Negative 8097 pIm working on a project to find the smallest set of words needed to use a dictionary to learn all the words in english. Basically if you know some subset of words you should be able to use them to understand words whose definitions are subsets of the words you know, and then adding those words to your known words list and continuing until you get every word in the dictionary.  p  pMy plan is to make 3 lists a list of known words, a list of words that Im saying I know a priori and a list of all words I have come to know either a priori or because their definitions are a subset of the known words. The third list would be the set of all words contained in definitions.p  pMy plan is to basically use brute force, iterating through every combination of words in list 3 and finding which combo has the fewest words while still being able to give you understanding of the entire dictionary.  p  pThe problem comes with checking whether a words definition is a subset of my known words set. For this I would need an english dictionary with words mapped to definitions in the form of sets of strings each word being an individual string. Does anyone know of one existing or will I have to make it myself  p  pP.S. My apologies Im new to this site and still figuring out howwhere to ask appropriate questions. Im sorry if this isnt the right place or format.p

Negative 8097 pI have a layout with an codeImageViewcode that covers the complete width and 34 of the height of the screen used for a background image. The codeImageViewcode is set to codeandroidscaleTypecenterCropcode, so it scales the image updown until either the width or height matches the image view bounds and the other dimensions matches or exceeds it.p  pAs the display size of the image is fixed via the image views layout which also does not depend on the images actual dimensions, only on the aspect ratio I dont need different dpiversion to ensure the image is displayed in the same size across different screen densities.p  pAlso, the codeImageViewcode scales the image down appropriately I assume, and I dont have versions with different resolutions that show a different amount of detail. I could of course create my own versions of the image in different resolutions. But the scaling used should be the same the Android system uses.p  pGiven that, is there any advantage to provide different versions for different resolutions or is it enough to just provide the highest resolution version Is there a measurable performance benefit in providing the different resolutions and save the system from doing the scalingp  pstrongEDITstrong Of course I can provide different sizes of the background image e.g. 500x500 and 1000x1000 but almost none of the screens will match it exactly. So it has to be scaled anyway. Is there any advantage in providing different sizes if the scaling has to happen anyway In addition, afaik, there are no pixelbased resource specifiers. I could provide a 2160x2160px version for xxhdpi, but that would be much to large for smartphones only needed for tablets. I could combine that with the size specifiers, e.g. largexxhdpi, normalxxhdpi, largexhdpi, etc. But that would lead to a lot of combinations and a lot of different images sizes, making the .apkfile a lot large than it needs to be and a lot of effort to maintain it.  And even than I wouldnt be able to hit the exact pixel resolution for a device, so it seems to be a lot of effort for only very little to no gain similar to the argument in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24098973thesenseofprovidingmdpiandhdpiresourcesrq1this questionsa. Is that correctp

I test the GCM message by sending to package to GCM server from my php script and app still got GCM message as it was. p  pSo, will there be other issue raised because of that missing permission and what is the point of having that permission anyway since without it, my app still got GCM messagep  pMy concern is, if our app is using a pluginlibrary that required permission. We wont be able to install our app on Lollipop device if there is another installed app which using the same library, isnt itp  pstrong NOTE strongp  pI already read this question, few people suggest the same thing to what I did, remove permission. But no one talking about what will happen after we do it or why do we have to add it.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27043933installfailedduplicatepermissionc2dmessageINSTALLFAILEDDUPLICATEPERMISSION...

Negative 8097 pIm not sure whether what this is true or not, but in my code, Im printing the value of a variable called currentTime which records the number of seconds since the application was run. The currentTime variable is recorded as      timeNULL  epocTime where epocTime was set to timeNULL at the beggining of the code. even though currentTime is of type double, it prints out as 1.0000, 2.0000, 3.0000, and so on as my application runs. However it never has a non integer value.

Negative 8097 pIm a little confused about a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comanalyticsdevguidescollectionandroidv4exceptions relnofollowcrash tracking with Analyticsa. AFIK it is only possible to store in Analytics strings which are no longer then 200bytes per property. So it is not possible to see full stack traces, since they are commonly much longer than 200 chars.p  pHowever with the Analytics v2 API this is possible with the EasyTracker, as a hrefhttpdandar3.blogspot.de201303googleanalyticseasytrackerdetailed.html relnofollowdescribed herea. There are also some halfduplicated which use the codegareportUncaughtExceptionscode property like this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq16033001995926Google Analytics crash report only shows first line of stack tracea or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq14009883995926Exception stack trace lost in Google Analytics v2 for Androidap  pSince I use the TagManager I cannot use those solutions, I already figured out how I can correctly track the crash for the first 200bytes with the TagManager, but what is about the full stack tracep  pI also use ACRA to provide the user a way to contact us directly with the stack trace as attachment, so the direct connection to the Google crash reporter is stopped and the Google Play Console shows no crashes.p

Negative 8097 pHi Im just getting into PHP and MySQL and English is my second language so excuse me while I try to describe my question well.  p  pIm trying to create a feedback  system where students can leave feedbacks about teachers. A student log in pick a subject first,  then find a teacher who teaches that subject and can leave feedback of that teacher. All the feedbacks of a teacher can be seen by publicno require login And the teacher can log in have look at the feedbacks and mark them as read,  once a feedback is marked as read it wont be shown publicly again . p  pThe problem Im having is not about the idea itself or the login system etc,  its about the database structure.  Mainly the teachers feedback database,  first the teachers are categorised by subjects,  then each individual teacher need to store feedbacks,  and those feedbacks can be activenot read yet or inactive read. p  pSince Im new to PHP and MySQL I dont know how to design the database to be effective,  lets give a problem as a example Display the numbers of active feedbacks of a teacher I can think of few ways to approach this, but cant decide which way is the best. p  pSOLUTION 1, One massive database to store everything , First it needs to filter the database by the subjects,  then filter by the teacher nameid then filter out the inactive one then count up how many active feedbacks are there p  pSOLUTION 2, give each an individual database,  and when the student leave feedback it gets stored directly into an active database for that particular teacher ,  when the teacher mark it as inactive it will be moved to a different inactive database of that teacher,   so to find out the numbers of active feedbacks just simply count the number of data in that active database. p  pSOLUTION 3, combine solution 1 and 2, because each teacher can only teach one subject,  so we create big databases for each subject,  and for each subject we create an inactive database where we store inactive feedbacks,  when a feedback is marked as read it will be transferred to that database.  Then to find out numbers of active feedbacks we can filter the subject to find the teacher and just simply count up the numbers of feedbacks that teacher have because all the inactive ones will be at a different database. p  pI hope I did not confuse you with my description,  I would really appreciate if any of you can tell me the most efficient way to build database for this problem in PHP and MySQL.  Thanks p  pEdit 1 sorry I do mean Tables rather than databases, so the question is whether I should create multiple tables for this problem or stick with one. p

Negative 8097 pIve been using a jQuery scroll to enhance my parallax scrolling page. Specifically, this one. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25425048jqueryscrolltonextsectionJQuery Scroll to Next Sectionap  pI am completely new to jQuery, and have only used some fairly basic JavaScript in the past. I can work out how to change and adapt code found to my needs, but I dont know how to slow the scroller down. p  pThe problem, is that to accommodate all of the content in my page, it needs to be about 17000px high. I only want the scroller to scroll to the bottom of the page then back to the top without any stops inbetween, but when clicked it currently takes about 1 second to scroll 17000px. This means you cant read any of the text displayed. I want the scrolling animation to max out at about 1000px per second.

Negative 8097 pIm using the below function to detect the last final value when user complete their scroll select on NumberPicker. The getValue would then get the latest value updated.p  precode    numberPicker.setOnScrollListenernew NumberPicker.OnScrollListener           Override         public void onScrollStateChangeNumberPicker numberPicker, int scrollState              if scrollState  NumberPicker.OnScrollListener.SCROLLSTATEIDLE                  int value  numberPicker.getValue                            codepre  pHowever, then I found out that, in the event the scrolltouch end not on a definite position of a value, but in between 2 values e.g. between 1 and 2, but slightly closer towards 2, after letting go the scroll, the function trigger captured the getValue as 1, but the scroll will autocomplete its scroll to centralize at 2. Therefore the last updated value of the NumberPicker is then set to 2 not 1 i.e. as was captured in my function above.p  pHow could I get the last updated value of the NumberPicker Or perhaps a way to detect the final auto scroll of the NumberPicker when it is centralizing to a specific valuep  pFYI. One option is to use codesetOnValueChangedListenercode. However this is not ideal for my case, as it capture every single value change even the NumberPicker scrolling is in progress.p  pThanksp

Negative 8097 pIm building a feature that has three circles inside of container that are next each other. Initially when I began building this feature I thought that I could just drop my circles into a codeflex containercode and they would all be good when I added media quires and resized the page. p  pMuch to my despise that was not the case..The circles went inside of the container perfectly but when I started to resize page I noticed that they were squishing I know this because codeborderradius50code as circles need to be a percentage and when they are pressed they change there size bc they are fluid.p  pThis issue prompted me to think of solution to prevent the circles from squishing. I had an idea of surrounding codedivcodes around the circles which would possibly stop them squishing so looked around to see if anyone had done this before. p  pMuch to my liking I found a solution that someone had posted on STO. I modified the solution slightly to meet my own needs which works fine but theres a small issue here, Im not sure I like the way it makes my markup look.

Negative 8097 pSo I came across a strange one today, which actually wasted a lot of my time, as I first thought it was some module that I upgraded on Drupal or some code change. In fact, it is related to Google Chromes browser update. p  pCurrently Google Chromes latest version is 44.0.2403.89. The previous version I was running was 43.0.2357.132. Tables on my site were displaying just fine. And actually, after hours of troubleshooting, I thought to just check the website with Safari and sure enough things were displaying as they always have. Then I checked Firefox, also no problem and displayed as it had. So it seems Google has changed something in Chrome to cause tables to break. Any idea whats going on and how I can fix it, or is this a bug with the latest Chrome versionp  pHere is a sample of the table being broken by Chromep  pa hrefhttpwww.yoninja.comjpbrowseresultstaxonomy3A74 relnofollowhttpwww.yoninja.comjpbrowseresultstaxonomy3A74ap  pSee how the middle columns table flows under the right side bar. If you check this page with the previous version of Chrome 43.0.2357.132, it displays just fine. Also displays perfect in Safari and Firefoxs latest version. What givesp  pstrong UPDATE strong So I have temporarily fixed it by using Drupals View Theming and modifying the viewsviewtableviewname.tpl.php file and editing the column width of the column which holds the long text. Even specifying the table width, whether with a percentage or a specific width in pixels, doesnt work in the latest Google Chrome. p  precodelttable classltphp print class gtltphp print attributes gt stylewidth770pxgt  lttable classltphp print class gtltphp print attributes gt stylewidth100gt codepre  pNeither of these work, specifying 100 doesnt change a thing. Specifying the width in pixels actually does change the width of the table but not the by the width you specify. Strange Why would Googles update change the behavior of something that has already been working previouslyp  pAnyway, the only way I have been able to get things working is by specifying the width of the column as mentioned below in one of the answers. However, I still feel this is unnecessary and it seems every other browser is still displaying tables properly. So the question is, will Google fix thisp  pIs there anyone I can get this working without having to specify the table width. I use this view in various pages, and I dont want to have to worry about specifying the width. Thanksp

It works great. I just added the file wrap and it allows me to launch directories and files based off of unc paths directly from the website. The issue is those darn windows shortcuts. Which I believe is just a matter of reading them correctly. So I was looking at the islink. The key is building the steps the right way so that if it finds the .lnk files then it will know to open them as such. Any help is greatly appreciated. You guys are the experts and I am here to learn. Even if I get hazed a little as this may be an easy fix. Lol. .p  pHave a great dayp

Negative 8097 pRecently i switch my php framework from Yii2.0 to CI. The problem i encounter is that the autoloading discussed in CI does not seem to the same with that in Yii. In Yii 1.0, when you want to autoload a file or a directorymore ofen, you can create a php file right under the directoryp  precodeYiiBasesetPathOfAliasalias,dirnameFILE Yiiimportalias. Yiiimportalias.subdirectory. codepre  pAttention that Yiiimport does not support recursive import, you need to add directories one by one.  I looked up source code of Yii 1.0. Basically it does is to check if the class already exist. If not, it will be added into a classmap maintained by framework itself. If so, import will end. p  pWhen you new a specified class, yii framework will firstly check if the file is already included or required. If not, it will look up in the classmap directories, and search for class you needed. In this case, the class will not be loaded unless its truly needed. This will greatly reduce file num required at the same time and improve php execution efficiency.p  pIn Yii2.0, cases are a little bit of different. Namespace are introduced instead of import method in Yii1.0. Code used are as followedp  precodeYiisetAliasalias,dirnameDIR codepre  psample class in this directoryp  precodenamespace aliasmodels class SampleClass      public functoin sampleFunction  codepre  pThen it can be used in other placesp  precodeuse aliasmodelsSampleClass sampleClass  new SampleClass ret  sampleClassgtsampleFunction codepre  pBut this seems not to be the case in CI framework. In CI framework, if you need any file or libraries. You have two choices.  The first is to set them in applicationconfigautoload.php. p  precodeautoload[libraries]  array     session,     parser      codepre  pThis two libraries will be loaded into global scope and can be used anywhere. p  pThe second one is to load them manually in your codep  precodethisgtloadgtlibrarysendmanager codepre  pThe class Sendmanager defined in directory libraries will be loaded. p  pBut CI does something that i dont understand. Except for include the specified file into php, it will also new an object and put it into thissendmanagerall in lower case. This seems pretty weird and hard to understand for me. p  ol liWhat i want is that the framework can preload the file, instead of directly requiring it.li liMost importantly, I dont need an created object.. Sometimes i would use singleton class with private construct function. When the framework tries to load it, an error will appear.li ol  pMy question is, does CI has lazy loading mechanism    p

Also, I know its bad practice to include a .cc file rather than a header, but Im not too familiar with doing that and anyway, I have definitely seen this work before. I was under the impression that including that .cc file containing the function is equivalent to placing it right there, so it should definitely be recognising the earlier code. One thing I have noticed is that the error is referring to shuffle.cc rather than what it usually says, something along the lines of from file located in Maps.cc..., perhaps this has something to do with it In any case Im stumped, thanks in advance for any helpp  pJoshuap

Negative 8097 pIve got a problem with doing a specific graph in Bosun. This graph should contain hosts with the highest memory usage in percentage, but I cant find any usable metric to do that. Of course I have strongos.mem.usedstrong just like strongos.mem.percentfreestrong, but for me it isnt quite helpful. I thought of grabbing two series from query, just like for the alerting total number of moemry and used one, divide used by total and multiply it by 100. p  pThe problem seems to be that I cant divide series, so the last chance is to write my own metric by stronggrepstronging and strongawkstronging emfreeem command in Linux.p

Negative 8097 pI have only observed this behaviour on iOS 9 iOS 8 works correctly.p  pI suspect this might be a bug on the SDK, and I have opened a radar to Apple 22644754, but I find it so strange, that I get the feeling that I might be missing a call or a step to avoid the leak.p  pWhat I have observed is that every time CIContext.createCGImage is called, there is a memory usage increase. The tricky part is that the memory increase occurs outside of the app.p  pIf you look at the Memory Report from Xcode, the memory increase is visible on the Other Processes section.p  pBasically, what I do to cause the problem is the following I have simplified the code to strictly the parts necessary to reproduce the leakp  pFirst I create a CIContext backed by a EAGLContextp  precodelet glContext  EAGLContextAPI .OpenGLES2 let ciContext  CIContextEAGLContext glContext, options [kCIContextOutputColorSpace  NSNull] codepre  pThen, I render an image using the followingp  precodelet input  CIImageimage UIImagenamed DummyImage ciContext.createCGImageinput, fromRect input.extent codepre  pDummyImage is just a sample image file. The leak is directly associated to the size of this image, so it is best to use a big one in order to make the problem more noticeable.p  pAs you can see, Im not using any CIFilters using them causes the same result, and Im not capturing the resulting image Even if I captured it, I couldnt use CGImageRelease as the objects are automatically managed.p  pIf the render code is executed enough times, the memory will grow so much that the running apps will get killed.p  pOne interesting observation is that destroying the CIContext does not make a difference, but destroying the EAGLContext does return the taken memory. That makes me think that the leak is happening on the OpenGL side.p  pAm I missing anything in my code that can cause the leak Is there any call I can make to free up the memory taken by the EAGLContext Recreating it all the time is not an option as it is a costly operation.p  hr  pI have created a simple project to reproduce the issue. You can find it atp  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comszm19u8rmujv6jetEAGLContextLeakDemo.zipdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comszm19u8rmujv6jetEAGLContextLeakDemo.zipdl0ap  pThe steps to reproduce arep  ol liOpen and run the attached project on a Device.li liObserve the Memory Report screen on Xcode. The growth will be seen on the Other Processes part of the Usage Comparison pie chart.li liThe app presents three buttons. Each of them will execute the createCGImage command a certain number of times shown on the button labels.li liTapping on any of the buttons will result on a memory usage increase of the Other Processes. This might be more noticeable after performing several createCGImage calls.li liTapping on the 100 Renders buttons will show more clearly the effect. li liWhen the memory growth is excessive, the App will crash.li ol

Negative 8097 pActually this is what Im trying to do. I have a form and when a user fills that form it goes to a thank you page where thank you message is displayed. Now what Im trying to do is as soon as the thank you page opens a pdf file should start downloading without the user clicking anywhere on the page. I tried to find a solution by searching but almost all of them have given a solution where one link is provided and user have to click that link to download her pdf. But that is not what I want. And I want to achieve that using Javascript or jQuery only, no server side language.p  pA clarification PDF download on clicking a link is already working. What I want is PDF to download as soon as thank you page opens. I know logically this should not happen because by doing this anyone can set any number of files to be downloaded as soon as their page opens and fill your local drive. But my client wants only this thing to happen.p

Negative 8097 pI was reading an article that was linked from the CodeProjects blog that lambasted the overuse of design patterns by newer programmers when writing code. I will try to find a link and add it later, but I read it a bit ago and the question has just been bothering me. The argument from the article was something along the lines ofp  pGreen programmers tend to use a lot of design patterns instead of following KISS principles and just coding for the problem at handp  pI have also read that some believe that using design patterns restricts the creativity of the programmer, which also is a little but of a strange argument.p  pMy question to the wonderful programmers of stack overflow who are more experienced than I is does this ring true Do you find that newer programmers who utilize design patterns often overuse them and force them into places where they shouldnt be used If so, what is your advice besides code more to better understand where and when to use patterns in programmingp
