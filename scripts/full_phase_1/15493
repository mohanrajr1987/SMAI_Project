Ive tried this and it doesnt work. In the activitys class it overrides the method just fine, but in the fragments class the compiler complains that the fragments onBackPressed method doesnt override the method in its super class. So, my question is, how can I do so correctly Is that even possiblep  pAnother way I could solve my problem is to have the full onBackPressed method in my activity and have that one call a method of my fragment, but I cant do that as my fragment doesnt have an id it is generated by the FragmentPagerAdapter.p
Positive 15493 pIn Android, if you have the Application context you can register an codeApplication.ActivityLifecycleCallbackscode instance that will be called everytime an Activity goes through one of its lifecycle callbacks.p  pHow can I accomplish the same for fragments I think there is no such interface for Fragments nor any clear place where I would add that. p  pMaybe customizing a codeFragmentHostCallbackcode creating a codeFragmentControllercode but how can I plug that for the whole applicationp  pThe use case is a library that needs to be notified everytime a Fragment calls its lifecycle callbacks and I dont want to create a BaseFragment. I want to be called only from Applications onCreate and thats it if possible....p

Positive 15493 pDemand AActivity contained in section View, and contains a ViewPager, ViewPager contains three fragments. The contents of the fragments filling is based on the data ,which is from Activity of request to the server . The problems encountered the getData  ps Activity request the server to get data method created in fragments and set to the ViewPager adapter. The problem arises.p  pQuestion 1 in the press of setting up the adapter, it will invoke the adapter finishUpdate method, which in turn will call commitAllowingStateLoss method, but if in the process of call I pressed the home button or the return key, the Activity will call onStop method,.At this time, there is a possibilitythe program will crash,if commitAllowingStateLoss behind the onStop method implementation. Specific reasons are as follows a hrefhttpwww.androiddesignpatterns.com201308fragmenttransactioncommitstateloss.html relnofollowhttpwww.androiddesignpatterns.com201308fragmenttransactioncommitstateloss.htmlap  pAndroid official advice is not using FragmentManager commit method or commitAllowStateloss method outside the OnCreate method .The reason can reference the article links below. a hrefhttpwww.androiddesignpatterns.com201308fragmenttransactioncommitstateloss.html relnofollowhttpwww.androiddesignpatterns.com201308fragmenttransactioncommitstateloss.htmlap  pMy solution in the onCreate  method to create fragments, and then the corresponding request data twice in fragments, in AActivity request interface request again in fragments. But the efficiency is lower. middle thought of a solution before using FragmentManager commit or commitAllowingStateLoss method , set a flag bit in the  AActivity onPause or  onStop method for judgment. Although this will reduce the chance to collapse, but will not be completely avoided .I do not know why.p  pQuestion 2 from AActivity jump to other Activity ,and then return need to refresh the content of fragments in AActivity ,the reason is that some state needs to be changed for example a TextView show ha ha originally, but jump back need to display ha, ha, ha, the fragments will need to refresh, fragments of the management process, however, is if you have any fragments of instance in memory will use this instance, rather than to create, so I use the FragmentStatePagerAdapter, without using FragmentPagerAdapter, but after the jump back quickly when there is an error, error is java.lang.IllegalStateException Fragement no longer exists for key f1 index 3 Methods to solve this error a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11756102javalangillegalstateexceptionfragementnolongerexistsforkeyf1index3java.lang.IllegalStateException Fragement no longer exists for key f1 index 3a But the problem is not solve all. So, I think of a way to, or use FragmentPagerAdapter, then creat fragments required fields, such as the TextView ha ha I defined in AActivity static variables, and then used in fragments. But it seems not a good solution.p  pIs there any better solutionp
Positive 15493 pSo Im working on my first real attempt at an Android app, just a simple scorekeeper for softball games. Ive got it tallying scores, outs, etc, and right now it just displays Home and Away. Id like to give users the chance to enter in actual team names. To this effect, I added a custom AlertDialog that pops up with an EditText, so when you hit OK itll update the HomeAway team name.p  pThe problem is Ive been Googling this for most of the week and Ive not found a single way to actually do this. Ive tried tagging the fragments layout XML so I can find the EditText, but it always gives me a null reference and crashes the app. I added a TextWatcher that presumably watched the fragments text, but once changed and hit OK, nothing happened. Tried adding the TextWatch to the fragment, that crashed I think, it was about two hours ago and Im exhausted.p  pReally, I think I need a way to have the fragment find the TextView with the team name and change it to the value of the EditText when I positive click, but I dont know how to do that. Or maybe Ive seen it and dont understand it, Ive only been doing this about two months. Id post my code, but I deleted out all the stuff that didnt work because it was taking up most of the screen real estate. Any ideasp  pEDIT So I followed advice below on defining views, that found the value of the EditText presumably, but hitting OK just made it set the TextView to a blank value. I think this is because the EditTexts contents went away as the dialog was closed. Either that or this is all wrong.  codeView dialogname  getActivity.getLayoutInflater.inflateR.layout.fragmenthome, null                         EditText mEtName  EditText dialogname.findViewByIdR.id.homeName                         View mainAct  getActivity.getLayoutInflater.inflateR.layout.activitysoftball, null                         TextView oTextView  TextView mainAct.findViewByIdR.id.teamOne                         newName  mEtName.getText.toString                         oTextView.setTextnewNamecodep

Positive 15493 pWe are using Retrofit and Activeandroid for my project.p  pCurrently we are facing an issue. The pattern which we follow in our project is, We get data from server and save it into local database and after data saved we call routine which fetches data from database and populate UI this all happens in single Activity..p  pNow we have an activity which makes 3 server request, and due to which the amount of code in activity increased.p  pWe are trying to reduce Activity code by creating fragment for the activity and giving responsibility of fetching data and displaying data to Fragment. Rest call will be made by activity. Now once the data is loaded from all the 3 request we need to inform fragment about data is loaded, what is the best way for this.p  pAnd is it even possible to send data to fragment once it is loaded.. or the approach we are following is not correct..p  pPlease guide us on this..p  pstrongEdit1strong I read about EventBus. Can event bus solve this problem or it will effect the efficiency.p

Positive 15493 pI am developing an android application in which my mainActivity has 5 tabs at the bottom represented in FrameLayout. Each tab points to a particular fragment which gets loaded based on the tab clicked. p  pIn my 1st tab, Ive an EditText. When the edit text is focused, I need to show the keyboard by just moving the layout of EditText and Send button up without pushing up the other components including the bottom tab frame layout. Similarly when hiding the keyboard, the EditText and Send btn layout should sit just above the tab frame layout. Can someone please suggest me the solution for thisp  pAssume the situation same as in Facebook comment. When we go inside a post to comment something, the layout Write Comment ET and POST btn will be pushed up without moving any other components including the bottom tabs News Feed, Requests, Messenger, Notifications, Morep  pI dont want to make the frame layout Visibility.GoneVisible as it ends up in an ugly animation when the keyboard slides updown.p

Positive 15493 pI am working on an Android app that has several different product flavors. Each flavor has a unique set of libraries it needs, but I dont have this information until runtime. Right now, all the features of the app are packaged into each product flavor, even if that flavor only uses a handful of them. What I would like to do is, at startup, determine which features can be accessed, and download the appropriate libraries it will need. Is there a way that I can determine at first startup which Fragments can be accessed by the Activityp

Positive 15493 pI have a maybe little bit stupid question, but I didnt find any answers on this. So I have a Fragment and some entity object which extends Observable. I want my Fragment to be notified when some changes were made in my entity, so I implemented an Observer there.p  pNow I have some doubts about where observers have to be added and deleted. I mean the most correct callbacks in fragment.p  pNow Im using codeonViewCreatedcode to add observer, codeonDestroyViewcode to delete observer, but I think that there are may be better places to do it.p  pHere is a sample codep  precodeOverride public void onViewCreatedView view, Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState      super.onViewCreatedview, savedInstanceState      WheelManager.getInstance.addObserverthis     PreferenceManager.getInstance.addObserverthis   Override     public void onDestroyView          super.onDestroyView         WheelManager.getInstance.deleteObserverthis         PreferenceManager.getInstance.deleteObserverthis      codepre  pI will be very thankful for answers.p  pstrongUPDstrong Also Ive looked through a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comintlruguidecomponentsfragments.html relnofollowOfficial Developer Guidea, but find nothing about this question.p

Negative 15493 pApologies if any of what Im about to say makes no sense or overlooks something obvious  my knowledge of CLR internals is spotty.p  pIf I understand correctly, then if I just build a solution for AnyCPU in VS2K5 or point MSBuild at that .sln file with those settings then the binaries only compile as far as MSIL. They then get JITted to 32bit if executed on a 32bit platform or 64bit code if executed on x64...rightp  pThe DLLs are used for a web app and hosted in the W3WP.exe process.

What givesp  pIf I run corflags against the dll in question it tells me ILONLY 1 , 32BIT 0 but PE PE32 . My understanding is that this means yes it is compiled only as far as IL, no its not limited to either 32 bit or 64 bit, but Im not entirely clear. Is the PE32 flag anything to do with it showing up as 32bit as per abovep

Negative 15493 pVersion control systems are obviously important in development projects but there use in web development projects appears to be more complex, what with the requirement of having a web server to run all but the simplest of web applications.p  pWith that in mind, I have looked around and discovered a few different methods of using version control in web development projectsp  ol lipProvide each developer with a virtual machine which is a replication of the development server and have the developer run their working copy of the application in the virtual machine.pli lipHave each developer use a sub domain on the development server, e.g. john.project.com and checkout their working copy of the app to the directories the sub domain points to.pli lipUse the version control system to checkout code, make a change, commit the code and then check it on the development server which points to the head of the repository.pli ol  pI can see a drawback of 1 being the added time required to create the virtual machines and ensure that the virtual machines are kept insync with the development server also the need to continuously change the developers host file to point at the virtual machine not the development server.p  pI can see 2 possibly being a problem if absolute URLs are used within the site unless there is an easy way to update the configuration to use the new subdomains as well.p  p3 is the easiest to set up but is rather primitive and it will presumably become quite tedious for a developer to keep checking in the code after every time change. p  pHow have the users of stackoverflow used version control with web development projects and which methodworkflow was most effective.  p  pPlease also include extra methods I havent thought of  read about.p
Negative 15493 pIm trying to set up a series of history triggers to automatically collect history for a given table via triggers. I want to use triggers as this guarantees I capture all changes regardless if someone forgets about saving it in the app. My problem is that I have this trigger.p  precodeCREATE TRIGGER db.deletehistorytrigger BEFORE DELETE ON db.payments     FOR EACH ROW BEGIN           INSERT INTO paymentshistory select , delete, NOW, USER from payments where PAYMENTID  OLD.PAYMENTID     END  codepre  pThis stuff everything in codepaymentscode into codepaymentshistorycode and fills out the action that was performed, the datetime the action occurred, the MySQL user that caused the action to be performed. Each user in my app has a codeUSERIDcode which is from the codeuserscode table that I want to save. For updates this is no problem as codeUSERIDcode is one fields used in the codeupdatecode query. However, in delete there is no data passed in and therefore NEW is not accessible as there is nothing there. I cant think of a good way to get the codeUSERIDcode to save into the history table on deletes short of doing a second query to update the record. Id rather not use this solution as it is possible that someone else may forget to call the method to update the record after a delete and that data would be lost.p

So I could resolve as much as I liked, every time the trigger would fire again, causing the next conflict. p  pThis trigger obviously I was not aware off, since my DB admin put it in place there to track something or the other.

Negative 15493 pIve got a bit of a problem. Im currently working on converting an old system to a newer version. In the old version, data requests were managed by Java applets, which had no problems with the char in the data. Now, though, Im fetching the data from a database and converting it to a JSONstring using XSLT, and then  with the prototypefunction .evalJSON  making the string into an object. The XSL then structure the data like this example p  precoderowsets [  rows [  IDxxx,OtherPropertyyyy  ]  ]  codepre  pWhich in it self is OK. Now,when theres some data in the database containing characters, the evalJSON fails, because it destroys the usually wellformatted JSON string, like thisp  precoderowsets [  rows [  IDxxx,OtherPropertyyyy more zzz  ]  ]  codepre  pNow, what i want to do, is escape the unwanted chars somehow  without having to make some kind of Stored Procedure to du it serverside for me. Ive tried to wrap my head around a RegEx, but Im not very experienced in that area, and therefore Im having a really hard time figuring it out.p  pIf its any help, the character sequences that are sure to be legal are [] and [,] and the sequences that are likely to appear, and should be escaped, are [s], [s], [,], [.] s indicates a whitespacep  pAll kinds of help is appreciated, even if its some SQL that makes it all a lot easier p  pThanks in advancep

All of these events have a handler that handles the event when it is fired. The delegate all the way at the top governs all handlers that match its signature are fired. I want to mess about with this delegate at the top, I want to remove all handlers and then readd them at run time. So the delegate at the top is a multicast delegate and its invocation list is a list of individual delegates that in turn point to one of the four handlers that I have added. I hope that makes sense, thats a general idea of whats I am doing.p

Negative 15493 pi do have a question about layouting with a listview inside of a scrollviewer. Once a listview is inside a scrollviewer it does use its maximum size and doesnt scroll itself cause the scrollviewer offers unlimited amount of space to the controls inside of it. The problem is, that controls that are below a long list are only visible if the user scrolls down and I want to make the listview only use the space that is necessary and use a scrollbar itself. Pictures do tell more information than words links for pictures also do tell much as my reputation isnt at 10 yet.. Edit2 well i can use only one link so i copied all pictures onto one.  If the lists isnt long everything is okayp  pPicture 1  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSWgUQ.jpg althttpi.stack.imgur.com7dDEC.jpgp  pNow if the list is longer the controls below move down into the invisible landp  pPicture 2  see link from picture 1 p  pWhat I do want to happen now is thisp  pPicture 3  see link from picture 1 p  pThat itself isnt really a problem cause we could put everything in a dockpanal and do dock the controls below to Dock.Below and Top to Top and let the listview fill the center with lastchildfill.

Negative 15493 pI am designing a UDP protocol which only requires there to be a single client and a single server, however I would like the ability to support multiple clients, or even better, multiple clients on the same machine. p  pWhen a client connects to the server, the server receives the clients IP and outgoing UDP port along with the message. However, I have not had any success in responding to the client via that outgoing port. p  pI guess my question is about what the right way of implementing something like this is, if data is to be sent both ways client to server, and server back to client. It appears to me now that a single socket will not be sufficient, and that both the client and the server must maintain both a listening socket, and a separate sending socket. The sending socket must also be repeatedly opened and closed if the recipient changes. Perhaps the server would have one sending socket per connected client. p  pSince it seems like the outgoing UDP port isnt an actual useful value, I have to keep track of the ports from within my protocol, so that two clients on a particular machine can work out their individual listen ports, relay that to the server, and the server will simply send the data to the appropriate ports after explicitly being informed of what they are.p  pEdit Okay, I dont want the Use TCP answer, even though it may be a valid answer. Ill describe the application a little bit I am controlling hardware remotely in realtime through the internet. I want there to be as little latency as possible, and TCPs data integrity and inorder guarantees are simply not going to help. I just need somebody who is familiar with datagram based netcode to help me make sure that my approach is sane. p

Negative 15493 pIve been looking for ways of making my site load faster and one way that Id like to explore is making greater use of Cloudfront.p  pBecause Cloudfront was originally not designed as a customorigin CDN and because it didnt support gzipping, I have so far been using it to host all my images, which are referenced by their Cloudfront cname in my site code, and optimized with farfutures headers.p  pCSS and javascript files, on the other hand, are hosted on my own server, because until now I was under the impression that they couldnt be served gzipped from Cloudfront, and that the gain from gzipping about 75 per cent outweighs that from using a CDN about 50 per cent Amazon S3 and thus Cloudfront did not support serving gzipped content in a standard manner by using the HTTP AcceptEncoding header that is sent by browsers to indicate their support for gzip compression, and so they were not able to Gzip and serve components on the fly.p  pThus I was under the impression, until now, that one had to choose between two alternativesp  ol lipmove all assets to the Amazon CloudFront and forget about GZippingpli lipkeep components selfhosted and configure our server to detect incoming requests and perform onthefly GZipping as appropriate, which is what I chose to do so far.pli ol  pThere emwereem workarounds to solve this issue, but essentially these strongdidnt workstrong.

Assign one set of roles to a user on one database, and another set of roles to the same user in a different database on the same server.p  pI figure one way around this would be to create a new training role with full access, and then limit this role to just the training database using pghba.conf.

Negative 15493 pSummary How do I copy some generated files into a webserver eg IIS or Apache directory using Mavenp  pDetails I have a working application that builds in Maven. Ive managed to get it building using the a hrefhttpmojo.codehaus.orgwebstartwebstartmavenplugin relnofollowwebstartmavenplugina which produces all the needed files .jar and .jnlp in a directory codetargetjnlpcode. It also creates a zip file with them all in at codetargetfoo1.0.zipcode.p  pAt the moment the webstart plugin does not have a codedeploycode goal  the request for it has ended up on the a hrefhttpmojo.codehaus.orgwebstartwebstartmavenpluginfaq.html relnofollowFAQ question 3a. It may be implemented in future, but the suggestion for the time being is to use a hrefhttpmojo.codehaus.orgwagonmavenpluginusage.html relnofollowwagonmavenplugina.p  pIve never used Wagon. To start with Id like to just copy the files to a local directory served up by a webserver. Later Id like to copy them remotely, probably using ftp. Can someone give an example to what I need to add to the codepom.xmlcode to get the local copy working and hopefully an ftp example too. I cant find it in the documentation. From reading I think I might also need the a hrefhttpmaven.apache.orgwagonwagonproviderswagonfile relnofollowWagon Maven File Providera but as this seems to have almost no documentation Im not sure.p

Negative 15493 pHello and good afternoon. I am facing an issue with the system i support. I am able to build Macros which can pull sql views to a document. The issue is that the columns for these views do not wrap on the document. If a certain row contains too much text, it will push the other columns out of line. To resolve this i am trying to build a function to use with my view that will sort of brute force the wrap by looping through each row and creating an additional row to hold text for certain columns where the text limit was reached. I have something that works, but its terribly slow at times.

Negative 15493 pI have to call some native C functions from C using pinvoke. So far, I had no problems marshaling the different methods and structures to C. Where my problem resides is in the fact that many of the methods I have to call are asynchronous, and return their final results to my WinForms application through Windows Messages. For instance, I have a call to a method that has the following signature in Cp  precodeHRESULT AsyncOpenSession LPSTR lpszLogicalName,           HANDLE hApp,           LPSTR lpszAppID,           DWORD dwTraceLevel,           DWORD dwTimeOut,           USHORT lphService,           HWND hWnd,           DWORD dwSrvcVersionsRequired,           LPWFSVERSION lpSrvcVersion,           LPWFSVERSION lpSPIVersion,           ULONG lpRequestID  codepre  pWhere lpszAppID expects to receive the NAME of my application MyApp.exe and hWnd is a pointer to the WINDOW HANDLE of my application, which I obtain with a call top  precode[DllImportuser32.dll] private static extern IntPtr GetForegroundWindow public static IntPtr GetCurrentWindowHandle      IntPtr handle  GetForegroundWindow     return handle  codepre  pThe imported signature isp  precode[DllImportMSXFS.DLL, BestFitMapping  true, CharSet  CharSet.Auto, SetLastError  true] private static extern int AsyncOpenSession[MarshalAsUnmanagedType.LPStr] string lpszLogicalName,                                        IntPtr hApp,                                        [MarshalAsUnmanagedType.LPStr] string lpszAppID,                                        UInt32 dwTraceLevel,                                        UInt32 dwTimeOut,                                        out Int32 lphService,                                        IntPtr hWnd,                                        UInt32 dwSrvcVersionsRequired,                                        out WFSVersion lpSrvcVersion,                                        out WFSVersion lpSPIVersion,                                        out Int32 lpRequestID  codepre  pI call the method as followsp  precodeInt32 r  AsyncOpenSessionlpszLogicalName,                                appHanlder,                                MyApp.exe,                                dwTraceLevel,                                dwTimeOut,                                out hServ,                                GetCurrentWindowHandle,                                dwSrvcVersionsRequired,                                out srvcVersion,                                out spiVersion,                                out requestID codepre  pInitially, the method call returns a result code that indicates the requested call has been put to the execution queue. Any time after the original call the native Dll completes the execution of the request and send a Windows Message to the application by means of its windows handle and name. The Windows Message code for this method is defined as followsp  precodedefine WMUSER               0x0400 define OPENSESSIONCOMPLETE WMUSER  1 codepre  pMore info about Windows Messages here a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms644931vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms644931vvs.85.aspxap  pIn my application I have overridden the method WndProc to be able to control the Windows Messages as followsp  precodeprotected override void WndProcref Message m      const int wmuser  0x0400     const int OPENSESSIONCOMPLETE  wmuser  1      switch m.Msg              case OPENSESSIONCOMPLETE         txtEventsState.Text  m.ToString         break          base.WndProcref m  codepre  pBut I never receive a Windows Message with this code. There are no error in logs or event viewer. I know my call to the method succeeded because I do not get any error code and because it is mandatory to have an opened session before calling other methods, and I can call other methods that need a session handler successfully no error code either.p  pMy imported signature and call to the method is in a class library project that my application is referencing. Am I doing something wrong here Can anyone give a light on what could be happening I do not have access to the native code, just to a test application the shows that the Windows Messages are being sent by the native C Dll.p  pThank to everybody in advance.p

Negative 15493 pAs it stands right now, I have a TableLayout that I am populating based on certain columns and every row from a .db file.  The table is populated based upon a single .db file which I will call x from now on.  Every time the activity is recreated, my populate method what populates the table checks to see what is in x.db.  Every row in the table has the same 3 columns, but if you long press a row then you can see every detail of this row the details calculate one of the column displays and the calculation is different for each row.p  pFrom here the user has the option to calculate a grand total, save the current .db file, load a different .db file, or clear the .db file and start over.

Negative 15493 pIn my Android app, the first activity performs various initialization tasks, calculating data that is subsequently used by other activities. There are corresponding termination tasks that free the data. At first glance, it would seem natural to perform the initialization tasks in onCreate and the termination tasks in onDestroy  both in the first activity.p  pHowever, since the first activity may be killed by Android while another activity is active, freeing the data in onDestroy would pose a problem for the activity that is still active and wants to access the data.p  pHow does one solve this It seems I need a way to identify which activity is the last one to be destroyed, so I can perform the termination tasks there.p

Negative 15493 pI need to store the application settings somewhere, but cant find a satisfying solution. Read only settings are pretty easy to store in web.config, but what about settings for application administration that would should be accessible through webpage Writing to web.config doesnt seem to be a good idea. I have considered storing the settings in custom xml file, but then if there is sensitive information involved in the settings, that seems to be problem, also if there are multiple users modifying the settings at the same time some kind of file locking has to be involved. Now I am inclined to store the app settings the MSSQL database, it seems like a secure and well scaleable solution, however it feels wrong to have a table to store just one row  the setting.

Negative 15493 pIn my MVVM app I have a tab control with a couple of tabs.  Whenever a tab is selected, a user control on that tab page gets loaded, and in that user controls constructor, a call is made that takes a little time to complete.p  pI want to change it so that the call is made after the user control is loaded and visible to the user.  I tried the IsVisibleChanged event, but it returns Visibletrue before I actually see the control, almost once I click the tab.p  pIs there a way I can make the call only after the control is done loading and visible on the screen to the userp  pstrongUpdatestrong Some more info The call right now is an async call. The issue seems to be that after the asycn call is done, the dataSource of a grid on the user control is updated and that takes a second or so. As a result, it looks like it takes a second or so to switch tabs, when what really happening is the grid being loaded with some data. Thats why I was looking for a way to start the request which triggers the eventual data load only after the tab switch is completed and the user control is visiblep

Negative 15493 pIm new to Python multiprocessing, but use Python quite alot. I use python forbr scripting system calls to different programs many times instead of shell scripting.p  pLets say I have a computing cluster with 64 processors, and I need to run an os.system call to call an external program many times over and over, each being expensive.p  pIs there a way to use multiprocessing to loop around my systemcallsp  pLets say I have the following loopp  pI have a list of appropriate filenames.p  precodefor i in filenames           ...code to setup new protein system..           os.systemAMBERHOMEexesander O i min3.in o min3.out p test.prmtop c test.inpcrd r min3.rst ref test.inpcrd codepre  pbasically my code scripts setting up a protein system and then running the amber program on the new system over and over again. It does this in serial, and takes a lot of time since if there are 200 structures, for each structure when it calls amber it can take 30 minutes, so total runtime is 30200 minutes. p  pWhat Id like, if possible, is to use the 64 processors perhaps a way or a reference to something where I can try to implement a way for me to use multiprocessing in Python so that when I have 64 processors, I can go through the above loop in a way so that an individual processor is each used for 64 independent processes the os.system command at a time, and when each one completes, it sends some signal to continue the loop for the next available structure. Maybe some way of 1 of the processors keeping track of the other processors doing the work via the os.system calls.p  pIs this something that is possible to implement in python using multiprocessing on a cluster If anyone can suggest an approach, or a useful reference to look into to be able to tackle this, I would be very grateful.

Negative 15493 pSay I have a component C that is being used in 2 places in my application. For example, I have a list of folders that are being displayed in 2 tabs. When user renames a folder in one part, this change should be reflected in the other as well.p  pIm thinking to use EventBus for this and make the folders component to fire an EventBus event, say FolderChangedEvent. This event will be intercepted by the second folder component which will automatically update its folder list.p  pThe question is that if I want at some point to use this Folder component in a 3rd place, this place will also have the folder list updated. This might not be a desired behavior of the application.p  pNormally, Id make the Folder component have an own addFolderChangedHandler... method but since this component is quite complex and has subcomponents, this might create spaghettitype of code. However, I dont feel like this component should contain any applicationspecific logic and throw events directly in the applications EventBus which is a big too highlevel for it.p  pWhat is the best practice for this case and how do you efficiently use EventBusp

Negative 15493 pI have been struggling with this for literally months in my project. Anybody who can help me figure it out will be my foreverhero. Seriously.p  pHeres the deal I have a UITableView with just 1 section, but the heights of the UITableViewCells differ. Each UITableViewCell represents an object, and new objects are constantly becoming available, and inserted into the UITableView. The only way to effectively discover the height of a new object which will be displayed in the table is to draw it once run the code that draws the UITableViewCell and look at what the resulting height is.p  pAh, but theres the problem The UITableView delegate method tableViewheightForRowAtIndexPath is called BEFORE the cell is drawn for the first time This makes sense the table wants to position the cells before drawing them.p  pIve been experimenting LOTS and can find only 2 options, both of which have major downsidesp  ol liIf the new object to be shown in the table has not been seen before, simply guess the height and resize the cell later after the cell is drawn as needed. This causes problems withs scrolling though, since when the user stops scrolling it might be the case that one or more cells need to be resized to the correct height, which creates a bad user experience as the table shifts around and reorganizes itself.li liPreCalculate the object height by testing the object before inserting it into the UITableView. When the new object becomes available, create a dummy UITableViewCell and draw it offscreen, thus calculating the height of the object and saving it for later. The problem with this is that, of course, we can only do the height testing on the main thread since we need to draw, which causes major lag in the application.li ol  pMy solution thus far has been to use 2, but to try to alleviate the problem by making it so that the heighttests only happen every 14 of a second, which helps to space out the testing, so that the main thread is not locked too much. But, the solution is inelegant and still causes lag problems, especially on older devices. The lag is bad enough that I really need a better solution.p  pPlease... anybody... help me...p

Negative 15493 pI am trying to get a better understanding of some of the inner workings of WCF.  I have done a fair amount of looking around, but I have not been able to find a clear explanation of what codeChannelFactory.Opencode does compared to codeIClientChannel.Opencode.  What is the purpose of opening the factory  If the channel is being used for communication, what part does the factory play in the process after the channel has been created and openedp  pThe question was asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions866302channelfactoryclosevsiclientchannelcloseherea, among other questions, but never answered directly.p  pEDITp  pAfter decompiling the source code, I found some of the specific reasons why Open needs to be called on ChannelFactory, which is documented below.p  pWhat Im still having trouble understanding is why this work is being done through mechanisms provided by the ICommunicationObject, when the factory isnt actually communicating with anything as far as I know.  Why not just handle these things when the object is constructed or disposed ofp  pI think Im probably far enough in the weeds that such an answer may not be publicly available.

Negative 15493 pIm about to start a project where we have a backend service to do longwinded processing so that our ASP.NET website is free to do quicker requests. As a result I have been reading up on  services such as WCF and Web API to get a feel for what they do. Since this backend service will actually be made up of several services communicating to each other and will not be publicly available to our customers, it seems that WCF is the ideal technology for this kind of scenario.p  pBut after doing a lot of research I am still confused as to the benefits and differences between WCF and Web API. In general it seems thatp  ul liIf you want a public andor a RESTful API then Web API is bestli liWCF can support far more transports than just HTTP so you can have far more control over themli liWeb API development seems easier than WCF due to the additional featurescomplexity of WCFli ul  pBut perhaps my question boils down to the followingp  ol liWhy would a REST service be more beneficial anyway Would a full blown WCF service ever be a good idea for a public API Or is there anything that a WCF service could provide that Web API cannotli liConversely, if I have a number of internal services that need to communicate with each other and would be happy to just use HTTP as the transport, does Web API suddenly become a viable optionli ol

Cant you sort for 3 values Whats the problem here In case this matters in any way, 3 is a ushort, while 2 and 1 are uints.p

In HTML5, each section can have its own heading element so it is okay to have more than one codeh1code.

Negative 15493 pI am working on a prototype Air for Android application that loads some remote swf files all created and controlled by me and I need to be able to pass a variable along to the remote SWF.p  pHere is a quick break down of how the process currently worksp  ul liThe Android app, called Loader, is installed on the device.li liLoader points to my server and finds Player.swf, which it loads into the main stage. Player.swf show a login screen.li liWhen a user logs in correctly, Player.swf receives an XML response from an API with a list of remote SWF videos to display for the user. Player.swf loops through the XML list and plays each remote SWF, one after the other.li ul  pNow, so far, so good. The remote SWF videos load up and play perfectly. But I need to start picking up variables from Player.swf pulled from the XML response to use in the remote SWF things like text strings, user IDs etcp  pFrom all the searching I have done, I believe it is down to the Sandbox environment, as Loader is a compiled application and Player.swf  the remote SWFs are all coming off a server. However, now I am wondering, as Player.swf is the one that has the AS3 code to deal with the XML response, and that is located on the same server as the remote SWFs that are played and therefore should be the same sandboxp  pI was able to pass a variable along using a URL parameter, but it only works locally and not when I use the Android application.p  pI found an old blog pot about Sandbox Bridges, but the example file download doesnt work anymore.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction in using the parentSandboxBridge functionclass to pass along a variable all examples I have seen deal with passing functions andor are coded for Flexp  pI cannot post any code, as I simply have nothing to show for what I want to achieve Im totally stumped on this bitp  pEDIT I managed to get parameters to pass along even though it worked locally before, it didnt work with the Loader app  Remote Player  Remote SWF animation combop  pI had to set the application domain context inside Player.swf seeing as it is on the same server as the remote swf animations, not sure why I needed to do thisp  pBut oddly, I cannot use parent or root to pickup variablesp

Negative 15493 pI have a very long winded question. I have recently been given a task by my employer where I am to create a custom DBF to SQL migration utility in C from 117 .dbf files. Each table has approximately 4050 columns and over 100 rows. Eg. Property Management Databasep  pHow I am tackling it is the followingp  ol liConvert a dbf file into a DataTable object.li liAdd the DataTable object to a codeListltDataTablegtcode which is contained in the model object.li liBind list to a DataGridView for column viewing purposes.li ol  pThis is all done in a background worker which works fine.p  pThe next thing I need to do is allow the user to convert and save this list into a very large .sql file or optionally, migrate it directly to SQL Express. Again, this I attempt to do in a background thread.p  pThis is where I run into problems. I have a method that accepts a DataTable object and returns a string. In it, I have a stringbuilder object which concatenates all the columns into a create table statement and attaches the associated insert statements in order to include the data.p  pThis method is executed in a loop while passing an instance of each DataTable from codeListltDataTablegtcode stored in the model object.p  pNow this works fine up until about the fourth or fifth DataTable before an Out of Memory exception is thrown. I am sure to initiate and dispose of any objects I am not using. I have even went as far as to change all my string concatenation to stringbuilder append logic to take advantage of the stringbuilders better memory management.p  pI am pretty sure that all my objects are deallocated and garbage collected, so I am assuming that the problem lies in the fact that I am storing all the 117 tables in a list of the model object. Whenever I need to access this list, I simply pass a reference to the model object. As soon as I start building an sql statement for all the tables, the combination between the DataTables list and the Stringbuilder object, its running out of memory.p  pI neglect to inform that I am new to the industry as I am fresh out of college.  I have been programming for many years only until recently have I been following best practice.  So my question is to all of you, am I tackling this project the wrong way  Is there a better way to do it and if so, could you help shed some light as to what you would do in my placep

Negative 15493 pI am creating two solutions for a project I am working on, one for the main server, which will ideally continuously run without need for update.

The server solution is a windows Application and the programmers solution the one constantly changing, AKA JupiterCode.dll is a Class Library.p  pI am accessing the code via telnet, which is required, and will be entering commands there. The input string will then be executed via reflection on the DLL file The user entered smile. Is there a command called smile Yes, ok, lets execute that code.. I have all of that working and its going swimmingly, but I hit a snag for when I want to actually update the DLL so that there are more commands the user can enter.

Negative 15493 pI was just playing around with the new stdfunction from C11, and I wrote an example that compiles with clang 3.2 and the Intel C compiler 13.1 but not with g 4.8.

This tells the system which Products go with each Organization.  The Org Config data template has a field called Selected Products.  When I add a new Org Config content item which always lives directly beneath an Organization I would like to be able to restrict the items that are displayed in the Selected Products field which is a multilist to only display Products that are already associated with the parent Organization.

Negative 15493 pIve done a bunch of searching and I havent been able to get an answer to this question  hopefully this isnt a repeat apologies if it is... p  pPreface  Im using Rails amp Tire to perform ElasticSearch. p  pI have an object, Place, with attributes name, city, state, and zip.  They are indexed as follows p  precodeindexes name, type gt multifield, fields gt     name gt  type gt string, analyzer gt snowball ,    name.exact gt  type gt string, index gt notanalyzed     indexes city  indexes state  indexes zip  codepre  pThere are three conditions for searching  1. Name only, 2. City, State OR Zip, 3.

However, condition 3 does not  it seems to only pay attention to the name field.  Im assuming it has something to do with using the citystate variable to search on both city and state... But Im doing this because a user can enter either Chicago or Illinois in the City, State  Zip text box and the search should still work, using either the geographic center of Chicago or the geographic center of Illinois, respectively. p  pAnything obvious Im doing wrong p

I dont mind if animation will freeze a bit though I prefer to not have delays at all but I really want to keep phases of all animations linked with same phase difference.p  pTo make problem easier to understand Ive added graphs. Y is alpha, X is time. Top 3 graphs  what I want to have. Bottom ones  what I currently have. Highlighted area is where problem comes. You can see that second views animation freeze for 0.2 seconds and synchronise with 3rd one. So they start blinking in the same phase. This is just one example. Some times they can animate ok, sometimes all 3 views syncronize in few rounds of animation and blink in same phase... img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQ79kc.jpg altAnimationp

For example, the number of updates of the height array sorted by nondecreasing order will be different from that of the height array sorted by nonincreasing order. in both cases, the we will sort the array except codeheight[0]code, because codeheight[0]code should be always maximum in this problem. p  pAnd Is there any method to analyze an algorithm which varies on input data like this amortized analysis will be one of answersp  pPS. I would like to clarify my question more, We are to set the array r[] in the loop. And what about this if the array codeheight  5,4,1,2,3code and codei1code, coder[2]3code, coder[3]4code because 2 is the first value which is greater than 1, and 3 is the first value which is greater than 2 we are to compare 4 with 1, and because 41, we keep trying to compare 4 and 2codeheight[r[2]]code, 4 with 3codeheight[r[3]]code. In this case we have to compare 4 times to set r[1]. The number of comparison is differ from when codeheight  5,1,2,3,4code. Can we still guarantee the complexity of the code to be On If I miss something, Please let me know. Thank you.p

Negative 15493 pThe RTF image support is very limited Windows support, not just in Delphi, other formats than bitmaps and metafiles work but are not displayed correctly by RichEdit control.p  pOne thing I noticed is when Microsoft Word image is copied and pasted into RTF it scales  smoothly as opposed to pasting image manually as a bitmap. The reason for that is that Word keeps internally a scaled preview of an image in Metafile format along with original image and this scaled version is copied and pasted to RTF and apparently RTF renders MetaFile images smoothly when scaled in RichText editor.p  pSeems like a good workaround and after implementing embedding BMP in WPF function I noticed one problem I cannot get around the resulting WMF is double the size of a bitmap.

Negative 15493 pThe results sent by the elasticsearch contain attributes generic to Elasticsearch. Example of a JSON returned by rails server.p  precode   localityname some text,  localitydetails some text,   score null,  type locality,  index localities,  version null,  sort [  1.0860322703674736  ],  highlight null,  explanation null   codepre  pAs you can observe,the major content of the result being transferred is occupied by default attributes of Elasticsearch such as score,sort,explanation.p  pI believe suppressing this behaviour will result in lower size of the JSON object being returned in the result and hence improvement in performance. Does elasticsearch provide such functionality Also how does Tire incorporate that functionalityp
Negative 15493 pI have an application using node.js backend and require.jsbackbone frontend. My backend has a configsettings system, which depending on the environment dev, production, beta can do different things. I would like to propagate some of the variables to the client as well, and have them affect some template rendering e.x change the Title or the URL of the pages.p  pWhat is the best way to achieve thatp  pI came up with a way to do it, and it seems to be working but I dont think its the smartest thing to do and I cant figure out how to make it work with requirejs optimizer anyway. What I do is on the backend I expose an apiconfig method through GET and on the client I have the following module config.jsp  precode This module loads an environment config  from the server through an API  definefunctionrequire      var cfg  requiretextapiconfig     return .parseJSONcfg  codepre  pany pagemodule that needs config will just dop  precodevar cfg  requireconfig codepre  pAs I said I am having problem with this approach, I cant compileoptimize my client code with requirejs optimizer since apiconfig file doesnt exist in offline during optimization.

Negative 15493 pRecently I ran into a bit of an interesting problem in terms of coding style.  Realizing that consistency is a key attribute of good code style, I inherited some code that had some interesting style patterns.p  pThe code in question basically ties two libraries together.  The program itself isnt too large.  Code for utility functions that wrap the first library are found in a .h and .c file that total a whopping 100 lines for both files.  Code that interfaces with the second library is found in a .c file that also contains the main total of 300 lines for this sole .c file.  All functions that are written with the second library are made static since they are super custom to the particular implementation.p  pThe problem I have is that each file has its own style.  The programmer in question has a style of his own, but the first set of files follows the style of the first library.  The second file uses the style of second library.  As a result, code in each file is locally consistent in terms of style, but the program itself spans several codes styles.p  pStyle differences include using GLib types and functions like gprintf in the second file and using C types and functions in the first set of files.  In the second file the one that interfaces with a library that uses GLib, there are portions that absolutely require use of GLib and others that do not.  However, in order to maintain local consistency, the programmer used GLib throughout the file.p  pAs a result, Im wondering what the best practice is in this case in terms of code style.  Here are the possible options as I see them.p  ol lipUse the style from the first library in the first set of files and the style from the second library in the second set of files.  This allows code from the library to match in terms of style and allows each set of files to be 100 consistent in terms of style locally, but not for the project as a whole.pli lipWrite the code with your own style, ignoring the style of the two libraries.  GLib calls will be limited to where they are absolutely necessary.  Standard C libraries will be utilized elsewhere.  This will cause the code to locally not match styles between each file and their associated library calls.  However, the code from file to file should appear somewhat consistent.pli lipPick one librarys style to go with.  While this should cause the projects code to be consistent, the code from this project to the programmers other projecs will be inconsistent.  Also, the source code file that has to follow the other librarys style may look a bit off.pli ol  pLooking forward to hearing any thoughts on this.  I think this is the first time Ive encountered a projects code shifting from one style to another with the same programmer.  Thanks for your input and feedback.p

Negative 15493 pTo keep things decoupled in my AngularJS app, Ive got a single codevalidationServicecode that different controllers may call to perform the validation. As it is, the codevalidatecode method in a given controller should just codeemitcode an event coderequestvalidatecode, for example which the service will listen for  but it does not appear that coderootScopecode ever receives the emitted event. For examplep  precodeangular.modulemine.controllerCommitController, [     scope,     functionscope          scope.validate  function              scope.emitrequestvalidate               ] angular.modulemine.services.factoryvalidationService, [     rootScope,     functionrootScope          rootScope.onrequestvalidate, functione              console.logreceived the requestvalidate event  go ahead with validation               ] codepre  pBut the codeonrequestvalidatecode never fires from coderootScopecode. Does coderootScopecode not receive events emitted from child scopes Is there some quirk in how coderootScopecode listens to eventsp  pIs there a more Angular approach to this Should the controllers simply call codevalidationServicecode directly Should the events codebroadcastcode from coderootScopecode to begin withp

Negative 15493 pI implemented a protocol for a little multiplayer game. It was based on bytes, so to emdeserializeem the received messages I had to iterate over the byte stream and parse it bit by bit. After I had all the bytes and knew the message type, I threw the bytes in a reverse constructor that constructed the protocol data unit from the raw bytes.p  pThis whole process was very ugly, not really OO and had unreadable emifelseem code. I had to implement the codereverseConstructorbyte[] bytescode for every protocol data unit pdu I added. An approach where some kind of schema is defined per pdu e. g. schema  [1 byte int id  x, x bytes ascii string, 4 bytes double], and where the handling of the bytes is done with that schema, would be more elegant.p  psI got a hint here on SO to use googles protobufss emApparently they are not fitting my needs, since I would have to change the protocol to adhere to protobuf standards.emp  pstrongINFOstrongp  pI cant change the protocol. There are strongtwostrong different scenarios I strongdontstrong want to support them at the same time or even in the same program p  ul liThe protocol data units have a length field encoded in the headerli liThe protocol data units have no length field, but one can derive from the message type whenwhere the message ends. li ul  pI personally am a fan of length fields. But sometimes you have to adhere to a protocol that somebody else designed. So the protocols are fix. They all have a header which contains the protocol id, the emunique message idem, and in the first scenario a length field.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pCan anyone give me a very small example with two simple protocol data units that are parsed by a efficient, generic receive method The only examples I found in the protobuf tutorials were of type user a sends message x, user b expects message X and can deserialize it without problem.p  pBut what if user b has to be prepared for message x, y and z.

Negative 15493 pIm getting started with machine learning and analytics, and my approach is to dive right in with data and learn methodstools as I need them.p  pI have a set of event data, logging peoples movement inout of a room using via RFID chips with unique ids so that I have a timestamp of when a chip enters a room and when it leaves.  I want to classify the chip ids based on their movements in and out of the room. p  pFor instance,p  ul liA chip that leaves and comes back regularly could belong to someone who works in that room.  li liA chip that enters and stays for a long time may belong to electronic equipment which is moved around.li liA chip that comes and leaves a short while later, with few or only one set of entrancesexits could be a visitor.li liA chip that spends minimal time in the room and does not visit often could just be someone walking through.  li ul  pThose are my four main categories.p  pSo far, I have tried kmeans clustering.  For each chip, I compute some parameters that could indicate a particular category average time spent in room, number of days seen in a week, total time spent in a room, and average number of entrancesexits per day.  p  pWith this, I have seen some reasonable results, but depending on what parameters I use results vary drastically.  Looking at chip parameters I generate on plot, theres a lot of variation in the classification.  I do not have any good training data, which is why I tried a classification method first.p  pIm mainly looking for some advice on what might be better algorithms or techniques to use, or even if my approach is way off.  I can provide code or dummy data if needed, but Im really just looking for a good direction.  Thanks.p
Negative 15493 pIm attempting to build a multitenant application using Play Framework 2.2 and have run into a problem.

Negative 15493 pIm trying to learn how to program using threads in C by using the codepthreadscode library. In my thread function I have a nested for loopp  precodevoid threadfuncvoid a      int i, t     struct type b  struct typea     int start  bgtstart     int stop  bgtstop     fort  0 t lt 1000 t           fori  start i lt stop i           This inner loop is evenly divided among the threads.          Calculation                   return NULL  codepre  pThe calculation in the inner forloop depends on the result of the previous tstep of the outer for loop, so the threads have to wait for the other threads to finish the current tstep, before continuing. Is there a way to wait for all the threads to finish each tstep before continuing the next tstep I tried to use codepthreadjoincode but that doesnt seem the work within the codethreadfunccode. Can someone point me in the right direction Or am I trying something which isnt possiblep  pEDIT i and t are local variables in codethreadfunccode..forgot to mention that..p  pstrongEDIT2strong Maybe my explanation is not very clear... Im creating some threads in codemaincode not shown in the code and each thread calls codethreadfunccode. Ive divided the inner forloop among the threads. But before going to the next tstep in the outer for loop, I should be sure that all threads have finished the current tstep, because the result of the next tstep depends on the result of the current tstep. How can I do that Hope that makes more sense now..p

Negative 15493 pI am implementing a double ended Queue by the means of a circular array.

So if it is of size 5 and you push a 6th element, the first element will be overwritten with the value of the 6th pushed element. The way I do the index is by the following formula which is somewhat common bindexNeeded 1  size   capacityb. In the back function I want to get the last element.p
Negative 15493 pI currently have a JS game posted on my website. I want to have an HTML form that gets the users name and submits it to the server saved on just a text file.

Negative 15493 pI am drawing polygons that are adjacent and whose borders are shared. Looking at the example image below, if I were to draw a polygon for Montana, Id like to be able to click on the nodes of the Idaho polygon for the part of the border that is the same to ensure the borders dont overlap or have holes. However, the nodes dont allow clicks directly on them, and if I make the nodes invisible then the accuracy is worsened and Ill probably end up with holes or overlaps between the two polygons.p  pIs there a way to snap a drawing to a node of an existing polygon If not, is there at least a way to make it so that I can click directly where the nodes are Ive set the polygons properties to editable false and clickable false, but the boundary of the polygon and the nodes still disallows clicks.p  pI havent seen any documentation in the API for snapping.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMTsme.png altpolygon on google mapsp

Negative 15493 pIm building a system that comprises a multiple heterogeneous services that talk to each other over a network, although in the standard deployment model they are all on the same machine. The UI client for managing the entities within that complex system should be able to display aggregated data from all comprising services while enabling search across that aggregated data.p  pIm wondering how to design the data retrieval within this system so that it is scalable as the amount of data to be searched is already high and increasesp  pIm thinking about two approachesp  ol lipThe client queries data from all services on demand and aggregates the results in its layer. In many cases it  will have to do joins between data coming from multiple services, so Im concerned about performance here.pli lipDenormalize the services data in a way so that it is convenient for the client queries and even store aggregations between the multiple services data so that the client doesnt have to do joins on demand. Probably, it would be better to store each services denormalized data in its own database or cache as thus it would be easier to keep all denormalized data uptodate. However, Ill need to put the aggregated views across multiple services data in some other place and Im concerned about the  overhead of keeping this remote cache uptodate.pli ol  pAny examples or references to existing architectures that solve similar problems would be highly appreciated.

Negative 15493 pI am unsure of whether or not the code has pointer aliasing or other standard conformance issues in the asserts cast. It seems that a pointer to the union type should be able to be cast to a pointer of the first member and since the union is only composed of these two structs, I think a cast to the first member should work, but Im not sure if this is correct or if Im glossing over padding details in the process. Are unions required to pad the upper bits p  pIt seems as this is unspecified behavior Does anyone have any insight as to whether this is suported.

The versions of this code for shorter ints work fine, but this version never finds the suitable value even if it exists in the array and always returns NULL.p  pIts also hard to debug because I cant figure out how to print these long long ints. if I supply a Python integer of 3000000 for searchval, then run the following codep  precodeprintfsn, PyStringAsStringPyObjectStrsearchval unsigned long long value  PyLongAsUnsignedLongLongsearchval printfI64un, value printfI64un, 3000000ull codepre  pI get the outputp  precode3000000 18446744073709551615 3000000 codepre  pSo something seems to be going wrong in the process of unpacking the unsigned long long int from its PyObject representation. I notice in the a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2capilong.htmlPyLongAsUnsignedLongLong relnofollowPythonC API documentationa that PyLongAsUnsignedLongLong seems to return a value with the unsigned PYLONGLONG type, but I get the same results when using this, except the search finds incorrectly the first element of the array instead of finding nothing.

Negative 15493 prepost from the PG google groupp  pI know theres been a lot of conversation on this in the past, but Ive been researching it for the past few days and couldnt seem to find a definitive answer or even what it would entail.p  pI was wondering how plausible it would be to embed a snapshot build of the Chrome webview or even the Gecko webview into a Phonegap app and to use that in place of the native webview that PhoneGap uses. The problem is twofold  1 Androids native browserwebview is terrible and 2 Each phone seems to have idiosyncratic bugsdifferences, which having one set snapshot to build against would fix.p  pIve seen answers ranging from Oh, yeah, just build the source and drop it in to Youd need a full team of Java devs to hack the PhoneGap API core to get it to work. Does anyone have an answer of what it would entail, how much time it would take, if its even plausible, etc I suppose the biggest concern is  given we can get a snapshot build of the Chrome webview, does that break any of the connections to the PhoneGap APIs Are they tied specifically to the native webviewp  pAny and all thoughts are appreciated.

Negative 15493 pI have created an application by using Silverlight 5. There are many twoway databind in it. I want to retore a change in UI by restoring the object behind. For examplep  pI have an object behind which contains properties double Left, Right, I inherited it from INotifyPropertyChanged. In UI, I created tow button ButtonLeft and ButtonRight and their parent a Canvas Control, ButtonLeft bind Left property in twoway mode and ButtonRight bind Right property in twoway mode. It works very well, if I drag ButtonLeft, then the Left property will be updated with the new Left Value, same for ButtonRight.p  pIs there any way to restore the old value after the change of UI. Actually, the relation of class in my application is very complicated, I have already knew that retore the value of property in object will restore the UI, so is there any way more general and loosecoupling to restore all the objects that need to be restored. p  pI have thought of creating an interface IRestorable inside Store, Restore for objects that need to save and restore state. An attribute Restorable for property which need to be restored. For me, the use of AOP could be a good idea, each time when an instance of IRestorable is created, AOP will call a method for saving the current state properties which is marked an [Restorable] of object. I dont know if I was on the right way. If not, any advice will be appreciated.p

Negative 15493 pAccording to Wikipedias VP9 entry and Googles Discussion Board, VP9 supports both alpha  and depth channels. but i scanned the source code of libvpx several times. There is no doubt the alpha channel is there. But the only times the word depth mentioned in the source files are about the depths of AVL tree or Marcoblock lookheads. Does the released VP9 Video Codec really support Depth Channel Can someone point it out for me where to look among the source files the lines of code describing the depth channel are ...one line of proof is enough. Thanksp

Negative 15493 pI would like to create a menu program so that when I give someone a DVD containing PDF files, mpg, mp3 files, etc., the user will be able to click on a menus button or hyperlink to select the item she wants to open.p  pI tried using an .hta file, which works just fine on my computers. p  pMy .hta file identifies the drive and folder where it is situated, and uses vbscript to identify the default executable which the client computer uses to open various extensions. The .hta file uses the FileSystemObject to run the executable against the PDF or other file that the user selects.p  pAlas, several DVD recipients told me that their Windows computers did not recognize .hta files, i.e., they got various error messages, e.g., Windows wanted to know what program to use to open the .hta file.p  pCan someone recommend a simple open source approach to take, in lieu of an .hta file, which would not require the user to run an installerp

Negative 15493 pWe have a table codeRequestApprovalcode that uses two fields to determine uniquness codeRequestTypecode and codeRequestDetailIDcode. Each type of request has its own details table whose primary key maps to the codeRequestDetailIDcode of the approval table. Theres nothing to prevent two request detail tables from having overlapping IDs. Thats why the codeRequestTypecode field is part of the unique constraint. This was to avoid having a separate approvals table for each type of request.p  pWe are trying to configure the request detail table to have a navigation property to its approvals. Originally, we configured the navigation property like thisp  precode        HasManyr gt r.RequestApprovals             .WithOptional             .HasForeignKeyq gt q.RequestDetailId codepre  pUnfortunately, this grabs the approvals for all request types. There doesnt appear to be a way to tell Entity Framework to limit the results to just those with a specific codeRequestTypecode.p  pCan I tell EF to additionally filter by request type Even if I had to modify the LINQ query to explicitly filter, thatd be fine. Unfortunately, there doesnt appear to be a way to augment a code.Includecode to filter out results.p

Negative 15493 pI need to prevent the default message box from Visual Studio Debugger to show up during a Heap corruption.

Compiler is Visual Studio 2010, and cl version is 16.00.40219.01. SetThreadErrorMode is not available on my system.p  pIn case this helps to understand the issue I am using CMakeCTest for automated testing. CTest is the parent process calling a hrefhttpwww.cmake.orgcmakehelpv2.8.12ctest.htmlopt3ainteractivedebugmode01 relnofollowSetErrorModea which execute the test. The tests are then submitted to CDash equivalent of jenkinshudson. However if the message box for heap corruption appears the test is flagged as taking too long to execute, instead of nicely reporting a low level issue. I have no control over the user compilation flag, and just need a way to prevent the message box to appear.p
Negative 15493 pI just switched from maven to sbt for a Scala build. Since part of the builds are also war files, I use xsbtwebplugin to create war files with sbt. Everything works fine, except an issue with the outputted WAR. p  pThe WAR codedependsOncode two other sub projects transitively. When I run package the classes and resources of the other sub projects are both merged and copied. Which also means that the codeapplication.confcode is overwritten by the most recently defined codedependsOncode and not merged.p  pHow this is solved by maven is that it includes every dependency as a JAR file in the codeWEBINFlibcode, however this is due to that maven has no mechanism like codedependsOncode vs codelibraryDependenciescode. p  pHow can this be solved with xsbtwebplugin By using a merge strategy like OneJar or do I have to split the WAR build from the other build and define them as dependencies.p

Negative 15493 pLet me first say, this is a Lab that Im doing for class, and Ive been working on this second of two programs for around 5 hours now, probably 2 of them stuck on this one part.  Let me first give you the requirements of the program so that maybe all of this will make a bit more sense.p  blockquote   pA theater seating chart is implemented as a twodimensional array of   ticket prices, like thisp blockquote  precode 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10   10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10   10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10   10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10   10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10   10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10  20 20 30 30 40 40 30 30 20 20   20 30 30 40 50 50 40 30 30 20  30 40 50 50 50 50 50 50 40 30 codepre  blockquote   pWrite a program that prompts users to pick either a seat or a price.   Mark sold seats by changing the price to 0. When a user specifies a   seat, make sure it is available. When a user specifies a price, find   any seat with that price.p blockquote  pThats the books description, heres what my professor has given me to go with as well.p  blockquote   pRequired Program Components The initial seating chart in this   solution is generated as shown in the example. The solution also   assumes that the user will enter a row and seat which start at 1 and   where row 1 is the bottom front row. Your program should have at least   3 static methods that i print the array, ii sellSeatByPrice, and   iiisellSeatByNumber. Please declare and initialize your array to the   provided seat price values in main.p blockquote  pWhat Ive gotten myself stuck on for around 2 hours is figuring out how to change just one of the numbers of the 2D array to a 0.  Say I entered a seat for 30, Ive changed my code around 5 times now to get it to work and Ill either have every 30 change to a 0, or a few of them, or none.  The main portion I need help on is the method called sellSeatByPrice.  Currently Im not getting any numbers to change.

Negative 15493 pReading the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comspeeddocsbestpracticespayloadcsw1DeferLoadingJS relnofollowGoogle recommendationsa of how to speedup the page loading p  blockquote   pDeferring loading of JavaScript functions strongthat are not called at   startupstrong reduces the initial download size, allowing other resources   to be downloaded in parallel, and speeding up execution and rendering   time.p      h1Detailsh1      pLike stylesheets, scripts must be downloaded, parsed, and executed   before the browser can begin to render a web page. Again, even if a   script is contained in an external file that is cached, processing of   all elements below the script is blocked until the browser loads the   code from disk and executes it. However, for some browsers, the   situation is worse than for stylesheets while JavaScript is being   processed, the browser blocks all other resources from being   downloaded. [...]p      pFor many scriptintensive applications, the bulk of the JavaScript   code handles userinitiated events, such as mouseclicking and   dragging, form entry and submission, hidden elements expansion, and so   on. All of these usertriggered events occur after the page is loaded   and the onload event is triggered. Therefore, much of the delay in the   critical path the time to load the main page at startup could be   avoided by deferring the loading of the JavaScript until its actually   needed. While this lazy method of loading doesnt reduce the total   JS payload, it can significantly reduce the number of bytes needed to   load the initial state of the page, and allows the remaining bytes to   be loaded asynchronously in the background.p      pTo use this technique, strongyou should first identify all of the JavaScript   functions that are not actually used by the document before the onload   eventstrong. For any file containing more than 25 uncalled functions, move   all of those functions to a separate, external JS file.p blockquote  h1Questionh1  pstrongHow to identify that scripts, that are not used when loadingstrongbr Say, I was charged to optimize a web solution that I see for the first time and that uses a lot of scripts that I am not aware about what they are doing. Is there a way to monitor and separate the lazy and early scriptsp

Negative 15493 pIm writing a simple toy compiler and I come to the part of generating machine code x8632 assembly in this case. This is what I have for nowp  pGiven the assignment statement d  abcadbc1p  pI first generate the following intermediate code 3 address code in Triples formp  precode0 sub, a, b 1 sub, c, a 2 add, 0, 1 3 add, d, b 4 add, c, 1 5 mul, 3, 4 6 sub, 2, 5 7 asn, d, 6 codepre  pIm using an intermediate code with the hope of later perform some optimizations on it. For now, I dont manipulate the 3AC and directly generate assembly from it.p  pMy scheme for register use is the following I perform all the arithmetic operations using EAX and save intermediate results in the other registers EBX, ECX and EDX. For example, from the previous 3AC I generate the following assemblyp  precodemov     eax, a sub     eax, b       eax  0 mov     ebx, eax     ebx  0 amp eax  free mov     eax, c sub     eax, a       eax  1 add     ebx, eax     ebx  2 amp eax  free mov     eax, d add     eax, b       eax  3 mov     ecx, eax     ecx  3 amp eax  free mov     eax, c add     eax, 1       eax  4 imul    ecx          eax  5 amp ecx  free sub     ebx, eax     ebx  6 amp eax  free mov     eax, ebx     eax  6 amp ebx  free mov     d, eax codepre  pemMy question isem what do I do when I need to spill the result of EAX but all the registers are busy EBX, ECX and EDX are holding temporaries. Should I save the value of EAX in the stack and recover it later If that is the case, should I reserve some extra space in the stack frame of every function for that extra temporariesp  pI repeat, this is only what I have come to for now. If there is other simple scheme for allocate registers I would like to know Im aware of the existence of more complex solutions involving graph coloring, etc but Im looking only for something simple that just works.p

The application is listed under games in his profile.p  pI have done the same. I have executed the app in my device and accepted the permissions Im administrator in roles. Me and my coworker are friends on facebook.p  pThe problem is that when I run mefriends in the graph api explorer I always get an empty array. I know facebook changed the friends thing to only show friends using same app but my coworker and me are friends and we cant see each other.p  pWe have spent almost all day on this if anyone could help I would really apreciate it.p  pMore infop  pI have noticed something Theres a combo in the Graph API Explorer where you can select the Application. If I select my application the one I will put into production later and run the query nothing is returned. But If I select a test application I have just created it works ok If I select as application Graph API explorer it works too. Could anybody guess what is happeningp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 15493 pI using Selenium WebDriver to test a website. I have PageObjects to represent the codeLoginPagecode, the codeHomePagecode and the codeManagementPagecode. My test first logs in, which returns a codeHomePagecode, then clicks a button that returns a codeManagementPagecode. Then it checks a bunch of stuff, clicks a link back to the codeHomePagecode, then clicks a logout link.p  pThis all works fine with Chrome, without using a codepageLoadTimeoutcode at all. However, in Firefox I get a codeNoSuchElementExceptioncode on when trying to click the logout link. Im assuming this is because the page hasnt loaded fully when trying to click the logout button. So I put a codedriver.manage.timeouts.pageLoadTimeout5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDScode at the start of my test, right after I create the driver. I still get the same error. Changing the timeout to be code5 millisecondscode proves that the timeout is working because the page doesnt load and a codeTimeOutExceptioncode is thrown.p  pIf I move the codedriver.manage.timeouts.pageLoadTimeout5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDScode to the constructor of the codeHomePagecode then it all works fine though. So I can solve my problem by having the timeout being set for every PageObject. p  pI would like to be able to only set this once for each driver, which is what I gather it is meant to do from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14606675pageloadtimeoutseleniumwebdriverusingcsharpthis questiona. But a hrefhttpsqa.stackexchange.comquestions5508seleniumpageloadtimeoutthis questiona says that the pageLoadTimeout does not work for clicking on links, which confuses me because I does work for me, but only if I set it for each PageObject.p  pIs there something else I have to do Or does the timeout get reset when the driver is passed to a PageObject I cant see how that would be happening as all I do in the constructor isp  precodethis.driver  driver codepre

Negative 15493 pI want to enable both vertical scrolling and horizontal swiping at the same time. I detect the touch position in codetouchmovecode instead of codetouchendcode, because I need realtime coordinates. Unfortunatelly, Chrome for Android fires codetouchcancelcode right after codetouchstartcode, so no more codetouchmovecode is fired. This codetouchcancelcode event can be avoided by calling codeevent.preventDefaultcode from either codetouchstartcode or codetouchmovecode. But scrolling becomes disabled this way, so my first approach is to go without codeevent.preventDefaultcode, and use some alternative method instead to detect touch position after codetouchcancelcode. Is it possiblep

Negative 15493 pI would please like suggestions for how to override the default matplotlib behaviour when plotting images as subplots, whereby the subplot sizes dont seem to match the figure size. I would like to set my figure size e.g. to match the width of an A4 page and have the subplots automatically stretch to fill the space available. In the following example, the code below gives a figure with a lot of white space between the panelsp  precodeimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  datanp.random.rand10,4  creating a wide figure with 2 subplots in 1 row fig,axplt.subplots1,2, figsize9,3   axax.reshape1,lenax  for i in [0,1]     plt.scaax[0,i]     plt.imshowdata,interpolationnearest     plt.colorbar codepre  pI would like the subplots to be stretched horizontally so that they fill the figure space. I will make many similar plots with different numbers of values along each axis, and the space between the plots appears to depend on the ratio of x values to y values, so I would please like to know if there is a good general way to set the subplot widths to fill the space. Can the physical size of subplots be specified somehow Ive been searching for solutions for a few hours, so thanks in advance for any help you can give.p

Negative 15493 pIm working on a Quran app Quran is the holy text for Muslims, and there are a number of such apps on the market already, but the one I have in mind is a bit special.p  pThere are two types of Quran apps the types that look exactly like a certain version of the paper copy i.e. page 1 looks exactly the same in all copies, regardless of the publisher. The problem with these apps is that they use images to ensure each page looks exactly the same, which is unnecessary bandwidth and also is not very flexible. This also does not allow the user to select individual verses to say, get the translation or to hear the recitation of that particular verse. p  pExample  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1baYy.jpg altMushaf Madinap  pThe other type of Quran is the type that does use text, and allows for the flexibility of verse selection. The caveat being of course, that there are no pages, the apps tend to merely have each verse on its own line wrapping around if necessary.p  pExample img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDOzC4.png altiQuranp  pThe problem with the second type of Quran app is that the Quran is one of the most widely memorized books. And one of the ways people memorize it is by location on the page.p  pSo I want to combine these two worlds. I want to use text to render the Quran, but I also want it to look exactly like the paper version, page for page, line for line. p  pWould that be possiblep  pThis is what I have very rough a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netabustamamwGJzm1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netabustamamwGJzm1ap  pThis is my CSS p  precodefontface      fontfamily Arabz     src urlhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu17145089tyaslabKFGQPCUthmanTahaNaskh.ttf   p      fontfamily Arabz     textalign justify To justify the text, all the books do this      fontsize 26px   codepre  pThanksp  pEdit 2 Upon further reflection, the defining factor would be finding a font. As there is no single pattern that governs the script of the Quran sometimes the same word can be written differently depending on context, I dont think a font exists for this. Using any other font would work theoretically, in context of this question, but it would not be something that someone would use since it does not mimic the physical text. p

Negative 15493 pFor a project I have been working on, the ability to draw lines with a gradient I.E. they change color over the interval they are drawn would be very useful. I have an algorithm for this, as I will paste below, but it turns out to be DREADFULLY slow. Im using the Bresenham algorithm to find each point, but I fear that I have reached the limits of software rendering. Ive been using SDL2 thus far, and my line drawing algorithm appears 200x slower than codeSDLRenderDrawLinecode. This is an estimate, and gathered from comparing the two functions times to draw 10,000 lines. My function would take near 500ms, and codeSDLRenderDrawLinecode did it in 23ms on my machine. I even tested the functions with horizontal lines to ensure it wasnt just a botched Bresenham algorithm, and similar slowness hatched. Unfortunately, SDL doesnt have an API for drawing lines with a gradient or if it does, Im blind. I knew that any software rendering would be significantly slower than hardware, but the shear magnitude of slowness caught me by surprise. Is there a method that can be used to speed this up Have I just botched the drawing system beyond reason Ive considered saving an array of the pixels I wish to draw and then shoving them to the screen all at once, but I dont know how to do this with SDL2 and I cant seem to find the API in the wiki or documentation that allows for this. Would that even be fasterp  pThanks for the considerationp  precodevoid DRWLineGradientSDLRenderer rend, SDLColor c1, int x1, int y1, SDLColor c2, int x2, int y2 Uint8 tmpr, tmpg, tmpb, tmpa SDLGetRenderDrawColorrend, amptmpr, amptmpg, amptmpb, amptmpa  int dy  y2  y1 int dx  x2  x1   Use doubles for a simple gradient  double d  absx1  x2 gt absy1  y2  absx1  x2  absy1  y2 double dr  c2.r  c1.r  d double dg  c2.g  c1.g  d double db  c2.b  c1.b  d double da  c2.a  c1.a  d  double r  c1.r, g  c1.g, b  c1.b, a  c1.a   The line is vertical  if dx  0      int y     if y2 gt y1          for y  y1 y lt y2 y              SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x1, y             r  dr             g  dg             b  db             a  da                  return          else         for y  y1 y gt y2 y              SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x1, y              r  dr             g  dg             b  db             a  da                  return        The line is horizontal  if dy  0      int x     if x2 gt x1          for x  x1 x lt x2 x              SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x, y1             r  dr             g  dg             b  db             a  da                  return          else         for x  x1 x gt x2 x              SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x, y1              r  dr             g  dg             b  db             a  da                  return        The line has a slope of 1 or 1  if absdy  absdx      int xmult  1, ymult  1     if dx lt 0          xmult  1          if dy lt 0          ymult  1          int x  x1, y  y1     do          SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a         SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x, y         x  xmult         y  ymult         r  dr         g  dg         b  db         a  da      while x  x2     return    Use bresenhams algorithm to render the line   int checky  dx gtgt 1 int octant  findOctantLinex1, y1, x2, y2, dx, dy  dy  absdy dx  absdx x2  absx2  x1  x1 y2  absy2  y1  y1  if octant  1  octant  2  octant  5  octant  6      int tmp  dy     dy  dx     dx  tmp   int x, y  0 for x  0 x lt dx x      SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, r, g, b, a     switch octant          case 0             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x  x1, y  y1             break         case 1             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, y  x1, x  y1             break         case 2             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, y  x1, x  y1             break         case 3             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x  x1, y  y1             break         case 4             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x  x1, y  y1             break         case 5             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, y  x1, x  y1             break         case 6             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, y  x1, x  y1             break         case 7             SDLRenderDrawPointrend, x  x1, y  y1             break         default             break           checky  dy     if checky gt dx          checky  dx         y           r  dr     g  dg     b  db     a  da   SDLSetRenderDrawColorrend, tmpr, tmpg, tmpb, tmpa  codepre  pSIDE NOTEp  pI am reluctant to just move on to using OpenGL 3.0 Which I hear SDL2 has support for because I dont know how to use it. Most tutorials I have found have explained the process of setting up the contexts with SDL and then coloring the screen one solid color, but then stop before explaining how to draw shapes and such. If someone could offer a good place to start learning about this, that would also be extremely helpful.p

Negative 15493 pI have an aspx page with an aspGridView control that lists documents that have been uploaded pertaining to a legal case.  The first column in the GridView is a series of href tags that, if clicked on, will open the document in the default program associated with that document type.  The relative path to the document is stored in SQL Server.  I use the DataBinder.Eval method to populate the path, which is then sent to a Javascript function that opens the document.  By example, I have one document record whose path is DATAAR000001AttachFilesCase112.txt.  The markup for the anchor in the grid is as followsp  precodeltItemTemplategt         lta hrefjavascriptvoid0 onclickViewAttachFileltDatabinder.EvalContainer.DataItem, FullAttchPath gtgtOpenltagt  ltItemTemplategt codepre  pThe Javascript function isp  precodefunction ViewAttachFilesFile          docs  window.opensFile      codepre  pIf I view the page source, the relative path looks exactly as I would expectp  precodelta hrefjavascriptvoid0 onclickViewAttachFileDATAAR000001AttachFilesCase112.txtgtOpenltagt codepre  pSetting a breakpoint at ViewAttachFile, however, I find that the following is being passed to the function, note all backslashes and the document name have been strippedp  pDATAAR000001AttachFilesCase11.txt this is from the text visualizerp  pI have tried embedding the escape and replace functions around the DataBinder.Eval call, but with no success, as Javascript is not my strong suit, not that Im sure either of these would be the right solution anyway.  I have also tried bypassing the ViewAttachFile function altogether, and coding the link asp  precodelta hrefjavascriptvoid0 onclickjavascriptwindow.openltDatabinder.EvalContainer.DataItem, FullAttchPath gtgtOpenltagt codepre  pbut that essentially yields the same result, as the backslashes are stripped out of the URL, the period is converted to 02 and the window opened returns a 400 error for Bad Request  Invalid URL.  I supposed I could doubleup on the slashes in the path column in the database, but that seems like a bad idea, and Im hoping for a cleaner resolution.p  pAny insight is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 15493 pWhat I am asking is a way or advice how to reimplement my app that receives data from sockets.  My app now connects to pusher service and gets the data from the socket. When new event new data on pusher is received the data is updated to the UI and thread for receiving data waits for a new event.p  pThis works ok, as long as internet is available. When internet drops, sockets are not reestablished. p  pI have an android service in which I receive data and then publish the result to the subscribers. Subscribers then call the UI update method with data and after that android service for receiving data is called again.p  pHowever android service is first called on onResume activity and in subscriber after every successful data. However if the network drops the service is not started again. How should I handle thisp  pMy first idea was when the network drops I started activity that checks network availability every 2 seconds and if network becomes available it restarts the sockets. However it does not work as reliable as I want. p  pIf you need to see the code I will post it.p

Negative 15493 pSo I read up a lot about how to properly use Response.Redirect without causing some errors.p  precodeResponse.Redirecturl, false  Context.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest codepre  pSituation  A user logs in the site and visits a page that lists forms.  The user sits on that page for an hour doing nothing which would log them out.  The user clicks a button to edit a title which requires a postback.  This results in the user object being null since it logged him out of the session.  p  pWhat I have done In the page load, check if the user object is null and if it is, redirect to the login page.  That is what should happen rightp  pProblem  The button event is STILL firing.  Is it because I have the following line of codep  precodeContext.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest codepre  pHow can I stop the event from being firing when I simply want to redirect to the login pagep  pI know I can provide true in the redirect code, but that will cause an error too rightp  precodeResponse.Redirecturl, true codepre  pWhat I currently do which is not the best way I know  In the button event, I again check to see if the user object is null.  If it is not null, proceed with the code to edit the title recording who edited it.  This is a bad way of handling this.p  pWhat I have seen  Wrap all events with Response.IsRequestBeingRedirected.  But if I have several pages and lots of button events, this can get a bit annoying.  Is this the only way to handle this situationp  pExamplep  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      Account account  Session[Account] as Account     if account  null              Response.RedirectWebForm1.aspxNewSessiontrue, false         Context.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest         return        protected void Button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e      Account account  Session[Account] as Account     Label1.Text  account.userID.ToString  codepre  pAgain, if I am already on the page, and the session expired, and I click Button1, the Button1Click method is still being called.  What I provided will give me a NullReferenceException.  PageLoad IS being called, and it is making the redirect.  However, Button1Click is still being called even with the return statement in PageLoad.p  pThanksp

Negative 15493 pIve seen questions similar to this but havent found a workable answer. Im looking to learn more about Python coding, Ive been coding a lot with Ruby, but would like to use Python for some 3rd Party modules which dont seem to have a Ruby equivalent. RVM and gems made 3rd party really easy to work with, is there an equivalent for Python Ive installed Python through Macports and Homebrew, and have tried to install 3rd party modules through Macports sudo port install and pip. Although the modules seem to install successfully, I cant get any nonstandard modules to run in Sublime Text.p  pOn the Sublime Text side, I managed to get Python to build by creating a new build system based on suggestions from a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions11965707usingvirtualenvwithsublimetext2hereap  precodeshellcmd projectpathvisyspkgsbinpython3 u file, path projectpathvisyspkgsbin, fileregex [ ]File ..., line [09], selector source.python codepre  pand also by using the SublimeREPL package. Ive also read that virtualenv is a common way to utilize 3rd party modules, as it will prevent conflicts. p  pSo my question is, How can I get Python to run in Sublime Text like Ruby did. How can I set up Sublime text so that it points to the correct directory where 3rd party modules are installed, so that it can build something that includes one of these modules. Im guessing there are multiple ways to do this, Im just looking for the most straightforward approach.p  pAny tips appreciated, thanks in advancep

Negative 15493 pGood evening,p  pIm in the process of moving some legacy .NET 2 code to .NET 4.  In one small corner of this project, there is a WSE call to a SOAP web service run by a 3rd party.  The service is quirky  it uses  codeUserTokencodeauthentication, which is fine, but the way it does doesnt not seem to work well with WCF.p  pMy first approach was to configure the binding to use codeTransportWithMessageCredentialcode and set the usernamepassword by way of codeltclientNamegt.ClientCredentials.UserNamecode.  At runtime, this threw an exception that indicated that security was missing on the response.  After some investigation with Fiddler, I discovered that while I was sending the codeUserTokencode header, but there was no security header in the response from the service.  WCF considers that formatting invalid and throws an exception.p  pAs an experiment, I switched the binding to use codeTransportcode security and added a codeltheadersgt...ltheadersgtcode block in the endpoint configuration, essentially hardcoding the credentials.  This worked and WCF was satisfied, because it was not trying to verify the message credentials.p  pIm at the point where I have a working prototype, but Im really unsatisfied with it from a design perspective, but Im at a loss to come up with a better solution.p  pIs there a way to either 1 configure the service so it sends the codeUserTokencode but doesnt require the security block on return, or 2 inject the SOAP header in code, so its more dynamic that putting it in the configurationp  pThanksp

Negative 15493 pI have a few ventures for example p  pI would like to sell my photos that I have taken, a gallery would be displayed, the photos shown have watermarks on them  less resolution. Then for 0.10 for instance, they can download the copy.p  pAnother one is that I would have people submit sketches of a web design and for 4.95 or something stupid like that, I would take a look at their website, possibly create it and show them a screenshot of the website then they pay the full amount for whatever price. p  pMy point is, I need some sort of way to accept payments but also have it drive a process like give them the photo, or accept and send their scanned photo  photo after payment. p  pWhat are some good services for that What language would that be in p

Negative 15493 pI have a Java 1.6 web app in Tomcat with a REST api using Jersey 1.x. In a ContainerRequestFilter, I want to set a property and then retrieve it later.p  pI started with this code in my filter classp  precodecontainerRequest.getProperties.setPropertyprogramId,foo codepre  pBut how exactly do I retrieve this laterp  pThe a hrefhttpsjersey.java.netapidocslatestjerseyorgglassfishjerseyserverContainerRequest.htmlsetPropertyjava.lang.String,20java.lang.Object relnofollowspeca says, In a Servlet container, the properties are synchronized with the ServletRequest and expose all the attributes available in the ServletRequest. Any modifications of the properties are also reflected in the set of properties of the associated ServletRequest.p  pWhen I try to retrieve the property, I have a handle to the a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavaee6apijavaxservlethttpHttpServletRequest.html relnofollowHttpServletRequesta object, but that object doesnt have a .getProperties method.p  pTo solve this, I ended up adding a line like this to my filter class  codeHttpServletRequest.setAttributeprogramId, foocode p  pWhich I was able to pull out later with codeStringrequest.getAttributeprogramIdcode. But Im curious how those properties are supposed to be retrieved.p

To analyze the results, Ive coded a small python script p  precodeusrbinpython  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt import numpy as np import os  results  np.loadtxtresults.dat  fig  plt.figure  ax1  fig.addsubplot111 ax2  ax1.twinx  ax1.loglog  ax2.loglog  ratio  results[,1]  results[,2]  printSpeedup factors unrolled loop  for loop  printratio  l1  ax1.plotresults[,0], results[,1], labelfor loop, colorred l2  ax1.plotresults[,0], results[,2], labelunrolled loop, colorblack l3  ax2.plotresults[,0], ratio, labelspeedup ratio, colorgreen  lines   [l1, l2, l3]   ax1.setylabelCPU count ax2.setylabelrelative speedup unrolled loop  for loop  ax1.legendloccenter right ax2.legendloccenter left  plt.savefigresults.png codepre  pAnd to make use of all that on your computer, copy the example code, compile it with p  precodeg stdc1y O3 Wall pedantic pthread main.cpp o main codepre  pTo plot the measured CPU time for different barycenter functions, execute the python script Ive called it codeplotResults.pycodep  precode for i in 1..6 do .main i done .plotResults.py codepre  pWhat I have expected to see is that the relative speedup between the unrolled loop and the codeforcode loop for loop time  unrolled loop time will increase with the size of the triangle set. This conclusion would follow from a logic if an unrolled loop is faster than a for loop, executing a lot of unrolled loops should be faster than executing a lot of for loops. Here is a diagram of the results that is generated by the above python script p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfOBIP.png altenter image description herep  pThe impact of loop unrolling dies of fast. As soon as I am working with more than 100 triangles, there seems to be no difference. Looking at the speedup computed by the python scriptp  precode[ 3.13502399  2.40828402  1.15045831  1.0197221   1.1042312   1.26175165   0.99736715] codepre  pthe speedup when 100 triangles are used 3d place in the list corresponds to 102 is 1.15.p  pI came here to find out what I did wrong, because there must be something wrong here, IMHO.

Negative 15493 pIn C the fread has a parameter of a void which will be assigned the value of the next chunk of bytes being read from the file.

Negative 15493 pIm trying to compile some code from the late nineties in Visual Studio 2013. For the most part its pretty straight forward but there are a small number of ASM blocks Im not too sure about Ive never done any x86 ASM, only the odd bit of microcontroller specific stuff at uni years ago.p  pThe function below generated compile errors relating to size mismatches, so I changed the ints to short int thinking it was written for 16 bit. That got rid of the size errors but now I have this error relating to the short int 60h linep  pError   1   error C2400 inline assembler syntax error in opcode found data typep  precodestatic unsigned int ReadTSR unsigned short int boffset     unsigned short int buffer   asm      mov ax,899bh         mov bx,2         mov dx,boffset         short int 60h     mov buffer,bx      return  buffer   codepre  pSo all the short ints above were just ints in the original code.p  pIf I remove short and leave it as just int 60h the error disappears, but I worry Id again be mismatching sizes only now perhaps the compiler isnt complaining for some reason.p  pGoogling the found data type error I havent come across this syntax, which looks very odd to me, just having an int declared as if to do nothing in the middle of the ASM.p  pCan anyone suggest how this can be safely ported An explanation of why that int is even there would be read with interest too ...p  pThanksp

Negative 15493 pIm working on a questionsanswers app in android in the style of a quiz, and I havent been able to come up with a method to properly implement a value to radio button.  The value is determined by whether the answer is correct or wrong.p  pI feel like theres a few ways to go about it, but Im not sure which ones might cause issues, or are simply bad programming practices.  My issue comes from the fact that the questions and answers are randomized every time the activity is restarted.  If it wasnt random, and I knew which answer would be correct, I think itd be easier, but I want to go with a random feature.p  pTo help clarify, I have radio buttons in an XMLp  precode    ltRadioGroup         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt           ltRadioButton             androidididradioAnswerOne             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt          ltRadioButton             androidididradioAnswerTwo             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt          ltRadioButton             androidididradioAnswerThree             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt          ltRadioButton             androidididradioAnswerFour             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt        ltRadioGroupgt codepre  pAnd I have the strings for the radio buttons in the .java filep  precode    TextView q1A1  TextView findViewByIdR.id.radioAnswerOne     q1A1.setTextThis ANSWER is   global.getA0, 0      TextView q1A2  TextView findViewByIdR.id.radioAnswerTwo     q1A2.setTextThis ANSWER is   global.getA0, 1      TextView q1A3  TextView findViewByIdR.id.radioAnswerThree     q1A3.setTextThis ANSWER is   global.getA0, 2      TextView q1A4  TextView findViewByIdR.id.radioAnswerFour     q1A4.setTextThis ANSWER is   global.getA0, 3 codepre  pThe strings are pulled from a class.  Each question has a class.  That class has a question string, and an array of 4 answer classes. The answer class has a string and a status truecorrect or falseincorrect.  Im looking to implement the status portion now into the radio buttons to determine which one is correct so that if the user selects that radio button and clicks a button to go to the next question, then the grade is calculatedadjusted accordingly.p  pIm curious in how to do this. Seeing as the questions and answers are randomized everytime, Ill need to implement a function to get the status of each question and place that status as some sort of variable attached to the button.  And whichever button is selected, that variable gets pulled and is added to an integer of questions answered correctly and the app continues.  But Im not sure of the java implementation to do such a thing.  Should my radio buttons be in the Java file instead of XML to work best  Dont know the truly best way to do it if there is one.p
Negative 15493 pI have a client where Im trying to port their code to my machine for development purposes. They built their wcf services using classes and interfaces only  thus no svc files. Almost like you would find with self hosting.p  pWhen I run the application, these services are hosted by WcfSvcClient for debugging purposes and I can see them starting up. I can however not access these services by pointing my browser to the given urls, nor can I step into that code.p  pI know this should work, because it works on a client machine  but I cannot tell why it isnt working on my machine other than suspecting it needs a computer which runs on their domainp  pThe strange thing Ive noticed is they declared a host url in the wcf services config file for each service. This url is used when starting WcfSvcClient  but it is not configured anywhere else I can see i.e. not IIS. It just mysteriously exists and I have no idea how to call it, debug it or even under which account it runs. Is this configurable somewherep  pCould someone perhaps point me in the right direction My knowledge with wcf is very limited. Thanksp

How can I leverage this option and the clientip attribute on the index to show counts on the world map After I saw the first two answers below. Before I push the data to ES, I looked up GeoPoint [lon, lat] with client ip. In Kibana 3.1.2 I created a bettermap and pointed it to this geo field. Curling the request behind this bettermap returns a lot of data back. their geoPoints look good. However BetterMap doesnt return anything back. Anything reason why Thank youp

Negative 15493 pAs far as I know, in PHP it is possible to use equality  and identity  operators on arrays. Equality will return TRUE if the keyvalue pairs are the same, and identity will return TRUE if, added to the equality condition, data types are the same too i.e. no casting of operands takes place before comparing. That said, I came across the following situation which has me puzzledp  precodeoutput is an array of values expected to be returned by testObjgtgetCategories  output  arrayreturnVal,         1,         1,         1,         1,         arrayarrayitem1, 23,arrayitem2, 26,arrayitem3, 19, arrayitem4, 22,arrayitem5, 20           j  5   input not shown is the array of values that will return each of the elements in output. ret is expected to be identical to output[j].  ret  testObjgtgetCategoriesinput[j]   The following for loop checks identity between each of the elements of output[j] and ret, which in both cases are arrays of the form string, value. If any 2 elements with the same key are not identical, the loop breaks.  fori  0 i lt countret i      in  printroutput[j][i], true     out  printrret[i], true     echo Expected  . in .  Received . out . ltbrgt     ifoutput[j][i][0]  ret[i][0] ampamp output[j][i][1]  ret[i][1] ampamp     output[j][i]  ret[i]              echo break         break          else              echo  they are identical ltbrgt         So far I checked identity of each of the elements of the arrays ret and output[5]. Now I check identity fo both arrays as a whole ifret  output[j]     echo ltbrgtidentical else     echo ltbrgtnot identical codepre  pWhat has me puzzled is that when I run the code rest assured input is well defined and there are no parse errors, if any I made them while copypasting to write this post I get 5 they are identical, meaning that the loop could traverse the whole array and all identity comparisons returned TRUE, but the comparison in the last IF returns false since I get not identical. This is against the expected results as explained at the beginning of my post. Can you help me find where is my mistake Thanks in advancep

Negative 15493 pLets say we have tens of java POJOs which represent my domain, that is, my data in the system which flows as objects between different layers of my system. The system may be a web application, or a simple desktop application. What the domain consists of doesnt really matter.p  pWhen designing my system, I am confused where I should put any validation logic. My POJOs  domain objects  represent my data, and some of the fields inside of those objects must adhere to certain criteria, but if I put a lot of validation logic inside my settermethods, then the only way to tell the calling client is to throw an exception. And If I dont want the system to crash, the exception must be a checked exception which must be caught and handled. The consequence of that is that each and every time I create a new object using settermethods or even constructors, I have do either rethrow that exception or use trycatch block. It doesnt feel right to be forced to use trycatch on many settermethods.p  pSo the question is where I should put my validation logic, so that I dont clutter the my code with a lot of boilerplate trycatch blocks and rethrows. The finest JAVA byte eaters are welcome to join the discussion.p  pI have researched and googled, but not found any specific discussion on this topic, so I waiting with great enthusiasm to get some deeper insight into how things really should be done.p

Negative 15493 pHow come every site explains that in SSE a single connection stays opened between client and server With SSE, a client sends a standard HTTP request asking for an event stream, and the server responds initially with a standard HTTP response and holds the connection openp  pAnd then, when server decides it can send data to the client while what I am trying to implement SSE I see on fiddler requests being sent every couple of secondsp  pFor me it feels like long polling and not a one single connection kept opened.p  pMoreover, It is not that the server decides to send data to the client and it sends it but it sends data only when the client sends next requestp  pIf i respond with retry 10000 even tough something has happened that the server wants to notify right now, will get to the client only on the next request in 10 seconds from now which for me does not really looks like connection that is kept opened and server sends data as soon as he wants top  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqqarj.png altfiddler ssep

Negative 15493 pCurrently Im working on performance tuneup for the clientserver application.  It has been currently deployed Jetty 9. Here, the client is connecting to the HttpServlet in the server application using HttpURLConnection. p  pAnd client sends a javaserializable object as the request and receives a JSON String from the HttpServlet. After receives the JSON string, we are parsing it and do what we want to do. This response JSON is 4MB5MB weight and request javaserializable object is relatively light weight. p  pMain problem is it take much time 1520s to download the JSON String over http. I made the JSON parser streaming with Jackson, so that it can work on the downloaded part without waiting for the complete JSON to be downloaded. But this doesnt give good results when it take much time to download.p  pOptions that I looked for are.   Increase the bandwidth   Reduce the JSON size as mush as possible Im working on this toop  pAdditionally I heard that Netty with NIO will be a good solution for this. Honestly, Im new to Netty. I have heard it is a NIO client server framework and not a HttpServlet container like Jetty. And it has boosted up major applications like Twitter with flying colours ref  a hrefhttpsblog.twitter.com2011twittersearchnow3xfaster relnofollowTwitter Search is Now 3x Fastera.

The App Store hosts the resources on Apple servers and manages the downloads for you. Ondemand resources enable faster downloads and smaller app sizes, improving the firsttime launch experience.

Negative 15493 pI have a SQL Server DB with over 500 tables. Some of the tables are emlargeem over 1 billion rows. Most of the tables are emsmallem. Under 1 million rows.p  pI have a partial EF model which maps about 25 tables, all of which are emsmallem. In general, when I want to use EF with another table, I simply add it to the model, but this now has me wondering a couple of thingsp  ol liIf I were to map the entire DB, but only actually use about 25 tables, would there be any noticeable difference in performance when compared to limiting the model size by including only the required tables Im guessing the generated queries would be the same, so I suppose only the memory footprint might be different, but is this negligibleli liSome of the tables that I include in the model have FKs to some of the emlargeem tables which are not currently included in the model. If I added those large tables to the model, could this have any effect on performance due to the FK, or otherwise I assume the DB does the same FK verification regardless of whether EF knows about it or not. So my question is more if EF does anything extra regarding FKs which could affect performance.li ol

Negative 15493 pIm having problems tyring to keep score in my guessing game. I have to use a for loop or while loop. I have it so 10 random numbers are created in a text file called mystery.txt and a file reader reads these numbers from the text file.p  pYour score starts at 0. If the user guesses the correct number from the text file they get 10 points. If they get the number wrong they add the the absolute value difference of the number they guessed from a number in the file. The lower the score in the end the better.p  pWhen I only run my if else statement once, it works correctly. Once I loop it more than once it starts to act up. p  pI have to use an if else statement and a for or while loop. Thanksp  pEdit Turns out I have to use a for loop not a while loop, Im completely lost now.p  pHow it should work When you run the program a text file gets generated with 10 different numbers I already have the code for that ready The user gets asked to enter a number, the number the user enters gets compared to the first file on the text file. If it is the same never they get 10 points to their score. If they get it wrong they get the difference of the number the guessed and the number in the text file added to the score.

Its works fine but problem comes when I add another codemathquilleditablecode span. When multiple span are there than every time when i click button than their value printed in every class at same time.
