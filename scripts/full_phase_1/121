Positive 121 pI had around 300GBs of CSVs on a network I needed to analyse so I quickly wrote this to append them into one table in SQLitep  precodedef pushcsvstosql     Connect to SQLite3     con  sqlite3.connectdbpath  mydatabase.sqlite     count  0     for path in paths         All CSVs in path         for i in os.listdirpath             if i.endswith.csv amp i.startswithpro                 mycsv  pd.readcsvos.path.joinpath, i, headerNone, sep                 mycsv.columns  [                     A,                     B,                     etc                 ]                 mycsv.tosqlmytable, con, ifexistsappend, indexFalse       Disconnect     con.close codepre  pI was able to run a few queries groupby when the database was small e.g. after only 2 files, however after all the 25 CSVs were readin the database became unusable.p  pWhenever I submit a command or use a GUI like the firefox extension to browse the data everything freezes. I see a lot of diskread activity go on for maybe an hour however then everything dies.p  pDid I do something wrong in the script I wrote Or is SQLite not meant for such large flat databases.p
Positive 121 pIm quite new to Android, and Im trying to query a database table Houses with the columns size, owner and city.p  pI am trying to implement a method p  precodegetHousesFromDatabaseString owner, String city, Integer size  codepre  pwhere emcityem and emsizeem can be null. The method is supposed to return all the rows where the emsize, location, cityem fields match the parameters, but only if the parameter is not null. i.e.  p  pcodegetHousesFromDatabaseJohn, null, nullcode should return all the rows where the owner is John, regardless of the other columns.p  pcodegetHousesFromDatabaseJohn, San Francisco, nullcode should return all the rows where the owner is John and that are in San Francisco, and so on.p  pMy current implementation goes like thisp  precode   public House getHousesFromDatabaseString owner, String city, Integer size          if city  null ampamp size  null              Cursor cursor  database.rawQueryselect  from   SQLiteHelper.TABLEHOUSES   where                       COLUMNOWNER   like   owner    , null                  else if city  null              Cursor cursor  database.rawQueryselect  from   TABLEHOUSES   where                       COLUMNOWNER   like   owner      and where   COLUMNSIZE  like  size , null                  else if size  null              ...                  else             ...               codepre  pwhere the if statements cover each possible variation But this feels horribly clumsy to me, and I wonder if there is a simpler way, and one that results in a prepared statement from what I read, coderawQuerycode alone is vulnerable to SQL injections, and codeSQLiteStatement.executecode is not to be used for queries.p

Positive 121 pWhen inserting multiple rows to SQLite3 in PHP using a prepared statement, if you dont bind a parameter for a row then the value from the previous row will be inserted, even if you clear the statement between lines.p  pLook at the following examplep  precodedb  new SQLite3dogsDb.sqlite  create the database dbgtexecCREATE TABLE Dogs Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Breed TEXT, Name TEXT, Age INTEGER      sth  dbgtprepareINSERT INTO Dogs Breed, Name, Age  VALUES breed,name,age  sthgtbindValuebreed, canis, SQLITE3TEXT sthgtbindValuename, jack, SQLITE3TEXT sthgtbindValueage, 7, SQLITE3INTEGER sthgtexecute  sthgtclear this is supposed to clear bindings sthgtreset  sthgtbindValuebreed, russel, SQLITE3TEXT          sthgtbindValueage, 3, SQLITE3INTEGER sthgtexecute codepre  pEven though I would expect the second line to have a NULL value for the name column, the value is jack insteadp  pSo either clear doesnt seem to work although it returns true or I havent really understood what its supposed to do.p  pHow can I clear the bindings between inserts in SQLite3 or even PDO Whats the best way to insert multiple rows where some rows might have null values for some fieldsp
Positive 121 pI am using Java and Eclipse to build a program that logs users in by checking usernames and passwords from a SQLite database. I am completely brand new to GUIs and it was pointed out to me in a previous post that my GUI and program logic is not very well structured. With that said, I have successfully logged four different users in and displayed their previously entered information on a form with textFields and comboBoxs. My Query on the SQL database is working great retrieving this information and I have been able to show the user that information in the correct fields. As you can see in my code below, I have a textField called strongUsernameCuststrong. This is where I want to pull my variable to select from in the WHERE clause of my query. The problem is that this textField is located in the Window.Java class and I am trying to use this variable in the CustomerInfo.Java class. I have done a ton of research on gettersetter methods and other ways to pass variables from class to class, but the sheer size and frankly bad logic of my program is making it nearly impossible. How can I pass this variable to the CustomerInfo.Java class Please feel free to correct my class logic as well. I have tried moving things around but lost functionality of the program, so I am trying to achieve this with the structure that I have.p  pHere is the Window.Java classp  precodeimport java.awt.EventQueue import java.awt.Font import java.sql. import javax.swing. import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.awt.event.ActionEvent codepre  ppublic class Window p  precodeprivate JFrame frame public static JTextField textFieldUsernameCust     Launch the application.   public static void mainString[] args      EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable          public void run              try                  Window window  new Window                 window.frame.setVisibletrue              catch Exception e                  e.printStackTrace                              Connection connectionnull public JPasswordField passwordFieldCust public JTextField textFieldUsernameComp public JPasswordField passwordFieldComp     Create the application.   public Window      initialize     connectionsqliteConnection.dbConnector      Initialize the contents of the frame.   private void initialize      frame  new JFrame     frame.setResizablefalse     frame.setBounds100, 100, 623, 382     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     frame.getContentPane.setLayoutnull      JLabel lblUsername  new JLabelUsername     lblUsername.setFontnew FontTahoma, Font.PLAIN, 14     lblUsername.setBounds86, 166, 86, 14     frame.getContentPane.addlblUsername      JLabel lblPassword  new JLabelPassword     lblPassword.setFontnew FontTahoma, Font.PLAIN, 14     lblPassword.setBounds86, 202, 65, 14     frame.getContentPane.addlblPassword      textFieldUsernameCust  new JTextField     textFieldUsernameCust.setBounds182, 165, 97, 20     frame.getContentPane.addtextFieldUsernameCust     textFieldUsernameCust.setColumns10      JButton btnLoginCust  new JButtonLogin Customer     btnLoginCust.addActionListenernew ActionListener          public void actionPerformedActionEvent arg0              try                  String queryselect  from CustomerInfo where Username and Password                 PreparedStatement pstconnection.prepareStatementquery                 pst.setString1, textFieldUsernameCust.getText                  pst.setString2, passwordFieldCust.getText                   ResultSet rspst.executeQuery                 int count0                 whilers.next                     countcount1                                  if count1                                      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Login Successful                     frame.dispose                     CustomerInfo custinfonew CustomerInfo                     custinfo.setVisibletrue                                  else ifcountgt1                                      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Duplicate Username or Password                                  else                                      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Username or Password is incorrect.

You can see above that I have been using strongString username  Customer3strong to test my query. This is where I need to pass the username variable from the first class so the WHERE clause is dynamic based on the username entered to login. Later, I will also need to pass all the variables I set after the Query into yet another class to compare with if statements, so I will need to yet again pass variables from class to class. If I am on the right track trying to use getters and setters, where in the above code would they be placed and how should I properly call them Thank youp

Positive 121 pBackground I am creating a  turnbased multiplayer game. The user is randomly matched with another user. Upon matching, the user is given a list of words, which he will need to use for the reminder of the game. This list of words is randomly chosen from a much larger list. p  pProblem Once the user is matched with another in the codeFindOpponentActivitycode, an intent is fired up and a new activity codePlayGameActivitycode, starts. This is the activity where the random list of words is suppose to appear but the area where they are suppose to be is empty. There are no exceptions thrown, the logcat has no weird output to my knowledge.

Negative 121 pI track alot of things with RRD, eg, uptime, network throughput, etc. This works well when you can fit all the graphs on a single page, however, once you scale beyond a page it becomes difficult to use graphs to catch issues, you need to look at them to see that there is an issue, and if there is hundreds or thousands of graphs, that obviously isnt possible.p  pSo, is there any standard way, or existing software for monitoring rrd databases for trend changes Eg, every day, network traffic looks pretty much the same, if it spikes or dips dramatically in a single hourdayweek compared to the norm, Id like to be alerted to it.p  pOr even just generic methods for finding changes in trends.p

Negative 121 pPart of the development team I work with has been given the challenge of writing a server for integration with our product. We have some lowlevel sensor devices that provide a C SDK, and we want to share them over a network for use by people collecting data. Sounds simple, right Someone would connect a sensor device to their machine in one part of the building and run our server, thus sharing the devices with the rest of the network. Then a client would connect to that server via our application and collect sensor readings from the device.p  pI created a simple, languageagnostic network protocol, and a reference implementation in Java. The problem is creating an implementation that will work with our devices that only provide an SDK written in C. We were thinking of doing the followingp  ol liCreate polling threads that collect and store the most recent readings from each connected device.li liUse a multithreaded server to spin off each incoming connection to a worker thread.li liWhen a worker thread receives a request for a sensor reading, the most recent value collected by the polling thread is sent back to the client.li ol  pThats a lot of threading, especially in C. So, to review, the general requirements arep  ul liRuns on Windows XPVista, Linux, and OS X machinesli liWritten in C or C, to interact with the C SDK we haveli liAccepts a variable number of simultaneous connections worker threadsli liMust use threads, not forking dont want to deal with another layer of IPCli ul  pCan anyone suggest a library and preferably some example code to get use startedp

In an ideal structure, the following operations should be fast O1On as appropriate and easy no paragraphs of mystery codep  ul liA Walk the tree from the root on each node  child transition enumerate all the equivalent versions of the child nodeli liB Merge two equivalence classesli liC Create new nodes from a list of existing nodes the children and other datali liD Find any nodes structurally equivalent to node i.e. they have the same number of children, corresponding children belong to the same equivalence class, and their other data is equal so that new or newly modified nodes may be put in the right equivalence class via a mergeli ul  pSo far Ive considered some of these could be used in combinationp  ul liA parfait, where the children are references to collections of nodes instead of to nodes.  A is fast, B requires walking the tree and updating nodes to point to the merged collection, C requires finding the collection containing each child of the new node, D requires walking the treeli liMaintaining a hash of nodes by their characteristics.  This makes D much faster but B slower since the hash would have to be updated when equivalence classes were mergedli liString the nodes together into a circular linked list.  A is fast, B would be fast but for the fact that that merging part of a circular list with itself actually splits the list C would be fast, D would require walking the treeli liLike above, but with an additional up pointer in each node, which could be used to find a canonical member of the circular list.li ul  pAm I missing a sweet alternativep
Negative 121 pI am attempting to encrypt connection string values in the Web.Config file for an ASP.NET 2.0 web application, following the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryyxw286t228VS.8029.aspx relnofollowprocedure described on MSDNa. Using the RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider, I created and exported a machinelevel key on my development machine using the pri flag, and imported the key and granted access on the web server.  Prior to testing automatic decryption by ASP.NET, I wanted to try manually decrypting the Web.Config.p  pI am able to manually encrypt and decrypt the Web.Config on the same machine using the pef and pdf parameters respectively, but manually decrypting on the web server fails with a codeBad Datacode error message.  p  pThe oddest thing is that the keyContainerName attribute in my Web.Config file seems to be ignored.

Negative 121 pIve seen some clients complaining about slowness of my website lately and Im pretty sure that the problem is related to their network.  Id like to be able to justify this to myself more thoroughly and also be able to more proactively reach out to clients that appear to be having network issues before they come banging on my door.p  pIf I was running ASP.Net I would try to use the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms524861.aspx relnofollow titleResponse.AppendToLog MethodResponse.AppendToLog Methoda and append a token so that I could tie back everything back to my custom application level logging user, client, processing time, etc..

Negative 121 pIm a contractor and am often brought in on projects to be heads down and just implement features for a deadline.  Oftentimes though my pace becomes faster than that of the underlying design.  So I often wind up having to create functionsmethods to perform a task in a preliminary way while awaiting the final design.  p  pCase in point, currently I was tasked with performing the default sort of some records in a way that is too complicated for the current database design actually Id use MySQLs field function, except I dont think JavaHibernate supports it.  So I created a function where the records could for the time being be sorted at the application level, that could either be reimplemented, or entirely avoided, once the necessary database design work is done.p  pMy concern is, once all the necessary design is finished in general andor specifically as regards the scenario outlined above, I dont want to leave behind a trail of possibly unnecessary functionsmethods.  Sometimes they might add value to the design, but sometimes they may wind up being an unnecessary layer of indirection in the end.  p  pHow concerned should I be about this  What can I do to mitigate this  Typically being a emveryem short term contractor, I usually dont have the time  or authority  to implement something such as a strategy pattern, which might be my inclination if I were actually responsible for the overall design.  p

Negative 121 pIm working on implementing different APIs in C and C and wondered what techniques are available for avoiding that clients get the encoding wrong when receiving strings from the framework or passing them back. For instance, imagine a simple plugin API in C which customers can implement to influence translations. It might feature a function like thisp  precodeconst char getTranslatedWord const char englishWord  codepre  pNow, lets say that Id like to enforce that all strings are passed as UTF8. Of course Id document this requirement, but Id like the compiler to enforce the right encoding, maybe by using dedicated types. For instance, something like thisp  precodeclass Word  public   static Word fromUtf8 const char data   return Word data     const char toUtf8  return mdata   private   Word const char data   mdata data       const char mdata  codepre  pI could now use this specialized type in the APIp  precodeWord getTranslatedWord const Word ampenglishWord  codepre  pUnfortunately, its easy to make this very inefficient. The codeWordcode class lacks proper copy constructors, assignment operators etc.. and Id like to avoid unnecessary copying of data as much as possible. Also, I see the danger that codeWordcode gets extended with more and more utility functions like codelengthcode or codefromLatin1code or codesubstrcode etc. and Id rather not write Yet Another String Class. I just want a little container which avoids accidental encoding mixups.p  pI wonder whether anybody else has some experience with this and can share some useful techniques.p  pbEDITb In my particular case, the API is used on Windows and Linux using MSVC 6  MSVC 10 on Windows and gcc 3 amp 4 on Linux.p
Negative 121 pIve written in JavaScript an interactive readevalprintloop that is encapsulated within an object. However, I recently noticed that toplevel function definitions specified to the interpreter do not appear to be remembered by the interpreter. After some diagnostic work, Ive reduced the core problem to thisp  precode   var evaler        eval function str              return evalstr      ,         evalfunction t1  return 1           GOOD    evaler.evalfunction t2  return 2    FAIL codepre  pAt this point, I am hoping that the following two statements wil work as expectedp  precodeprintt1      gt Results in 1 This works printt2      gt Results in 2 this fails with an error that t2 is undefined. codepre  pWhat I get instead is the expected value for the codet1code line, and the codet2code line fails with an error that codet2code is unbound.p  pIOW After running this script, I have a definition for codet1code, and no defintion for codet2code. The act of calling eval from within codeevalercode is sufficiently different from the toplevel call that the global definition does not get recorded. What does happen is that the call to codeevaler.evalcode returns a function object, so Im presuming that codet2code is being defined and stored in some other set of bindings that I dont have access to. Its not defined as a member in codeevalercode.p  pIs there any easy fix for this Ive tried all sorts of fixes, and havent stumbled upon one that works. Most of what Ive done has centered around putting the call to eval in an anonymous function, and altering the way thats called, chainging codeparentcode, etc.p  pAny thoughts on how to fix this p  pHeres the result of a bit more investigationp  hr  ptldr Rhino adds an intermediate scope to the scope chain when calling a method on an instance. codet2code is being defined in this intermediate scope, which is immediately discarded. Matt Your hacky approach might well be the best way to solve this.p  pIm still doing some work on the root cause, but thanks to some quality time with jdb, I now have more understanding of whats happening. As has been discussed, a function statement like codefunction t1  return 42 code does two things. p  ul liIt creates an anonymous instance of a function object, like youd get with the expression codefunction  return 42 codeli liIt binds that anonymous function to the current top scope with the name codet1code.li ul  pMy initial question is about why Im not seeing the second of these things happen when I call codeevalcode from within a method of an object.p  pThe code that actually performs the binding in Rhino appears to be in the function codeorg.mozilla.javascript.ScriptRuntime.initFunctioncode. p  precode    if type  FunctionNode.FUNCTIONSTATEMENT           ....                 scope.putname, scope, function codepre  pFor the codet1code case above, codescopecode is what Ive set to be my toplevel scope. This is where I want my toplevel functions defined, so this is an expected resultp  precodemain[1] print function.getFunctionName  function.getFunctionName  t1 main[1] print scope  scope  com.me.testprogram.Main24148662 codepre  pHowever, in the codet2code case, codescopecode is something else entirelyp  precodemain[1] print function.getFunctionName  function.getFunctionName  t2 main[1] print scope  scope  org.mozilla.javascript.NativeCall23abcc03 codepre  pAnd its the parent scope of this codeNativeCallcode that is my expected toplevel scopep  precodemain[1] print scope.getParentScope  scope.getParentScope  com.me.testprogram.Main24148662 codepre  pThis is more or less what I was afraid of when I wrote this above  In the direct eval case, t2 is being bound in the global environment. In the evaler case, its being bound elsewhere In this case, elsewhere turns out to be the instance of codeNativeCallcode... the codet2code function gets created, bound to a codet2code variable in the codeNativeCallcode, and the codeNativeCallcode goes away when the call to codeevaler.evalcode returns.p  pAnd this is where things get a bit fuzzy... I havent done as much analysis as Id like, but my current working theory is that the codeNativeCallcode scope is needed to ensure that codethiscode points to codeevalercode when execution in the call to codeevaler.evalcode. Backing up the stack frame a bit, the codeNativeCallcode gets added to the scope chain by codeInterpreter.initFramecode when the function needs activation and has a nonzero function type. Im assuming that these things are true for simple function invocations only, but havent traced upstream enough to know for sure. Maybe tomorrow.p

Negative 121 pI run a lyrics web site and I have a single table that basically keeps an index of songs essentially primary key with auto increment songid, artist, and song title.p  pThe lyrics themselves are stored across 10 shards, with each shard based on songid MOD 10. There are two columns songid and songlyrics. The songid field is primary key, but emnotem auto increment, and stores the same integer as in the index table.p  pMy question is, being that from what Ive read about InnoDB and primary key, is it any kind of performance hit that, for example on shard 0, the songid rows go 10, 20, 30, etc. and are not consecutive My fear is that skipping numbers in primary key is going to impact performance.p  pEven with memcached there isnt a huge strain right now, but Im going to be adding some new features in addition to lyrics so if Im going to change the schema, now is a better time than any. I appreciate any insight. Thank youp

Negative 121 pIm trying to build a simple web application that will allow people to send SMS messages FROM their mobile phone TO my application.p  pIve seen this question asked beforep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions526046receivesmsmessagesbywebapplicationReceive SMS messages by web applicationabr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions388657receivingasmsmessageinanetapplicationReceiving a SMS message in a .NET applicationap  p... but I have a few unique I think circumstances.p  ol liIm expecting a very small number of messages lt1,000monthli liMy users are all in the U.S.li liI dont need to SEND SMS messages  I just want to allow users to be able to send messages TO the applicationli ol  pIm aware of major SMS providers like Clickatell. However, their services seem like HUGE overkill.p  pIdeally, Id like users to be able to send an SMS message to an EMAIL account I have set up. However, based on a superficial investigation, it looks like thats not possible. E.g., I tried it on my iPhone, and the message isnt received.p  pSo, I guess the next best alternative is that my users send SMS messages to a dedicated phone number, and have those messages forwarded to an email account on my server. That would work, I guess. But Im not sure how to do the forwarding part, or if its even possible.p  pClickatell offers a service like that, but they charge a few hundred bucks to set up a number, a few hundred bucks to RENT the number each month, and a few pennies for each message. And, they only offer nonUS phone numbers. In the US, you apparently need to have a shortcode, thats INCREDIBLY expensive. Seems like there should be a MUCH simpler approach.p  pIve read that people buy cheap phones and connect them to their server, but I dont have my own server Im using a cheap hosted server at MediaTemple.p

Negative 121 pI am a novice in using the Esper event stream engine in Java.  The scenario is that events are coming in as POJOs.  They have a field that I want to filter on.  The filtered values will change over time.  I would prefer to not remove and insert a new statement every time a change occurs.p  pExamplep  pEvent is named strongMyEventstrong, and has the field strongsourcestrong.  Value could be one of emhomeem, emworkem, or emschoolem. A web service allows users to change the values for strongsourcestrong they are interested in. The EPL statement will look like p  precodeselect  from MyEvent where source in  home, school  codepre  pSo at any time, school could be removed, and the impact must be reflected as fast as possible.  The question is, how best to make this happen  Ive ruled out cached database calls because of the latency between the update taking effect.p  pIdeas arep  p1 Have a stream called SourcesOfInterest with a sources field of type List, and change the statement to bep  precodeselect  from MyEvent where source in SourcesOfInterest.winlength1.sources codepre  pThe web service inserts SourcesOfInterest events into this stream, where only the most recent is looked at. Not even sure if the syntax is right.p  p2 Have the statement reference a runtime variable.  Then the statement would bep  precodeselect  from MyEvent where source in  mySourcesVariable  codepre  pThe web service would invoke p  precodeEPRuntime.setVariableValue mySourcesVariable, myArrayOfSources  codepre  pAre there other options  Performance issues to any of thesep

However, called from the spec, it renders as usersid, making the test fail. p  pHow do I specify the correct namespace to use for the helper within the specp  pThanksp

Negative 121 pIm wondering if theres a way to speed up a mysql query which is ordered by multiple subqueries. p  pOn a music related site users can like different things like artists, songs, albums etc. These likes are all stored in the same table.

Negative 121 pI was reading the following Apple documentation on completion block in dispatch queues, and I have trouble understanding part of it.  The document mentions that To prevent the queue from being released prematurely, it is critical to retain that queue initially and release it once the completion block has been dispatched.  This contradicts my understanding that the block retains all the variables in its closure, which is mentioned in the Block Programming Guide.p  pWhat am I missing here  The snippet from the document is pasted belowp  blockquote   pA completion block is just another piece of code that you dispatch to a queue at the end of your original task. The calling code typically provides the completion block as a parameter when it starts the task. All the task code has to do is submit the specified block or function to the specified queue when it finishes its work.p      pListing 34 shows an averaging function implemented using blocks. The last two parameters to the averaging function allow the caller to specify a queue and block to use when reporting the results. After the averaging function computes its value, it passes the results to the specified block and dispatches it to the queue. To prevent the queue from being released prematurely, it is critical to retain that queue initially and release it once the completion block has been dispatched.

Negative 121 pWhile playing with different sort algorithms I was surprised that Groovy closures were performing really poorly. I couldnt find a good answer to this so far, so trying my luck here now  Why are Groovy closures so much slower than traditional methodsp  pHere is a simple example that shows the performance difference. It creates two lists with random numbers and sorts them in reverse order, measuring the sorting time. On my machine and for 10k elements it takes strong270msstrong using a closure and only strong50msstrong using the Comparator implementation. p  pThe timings vary a bit based on the distribution of random numbers. Also I tried Groovy 1.7.4 and 1.8.0, seeing slightly better performance with the latter.

Negative 121 pI have a situation where Im using MacRuby for a thin local gui, and most of the work is done in a Parser object that Ive created.  I will eventually also have an IronRuby thin client, that will also interact with the Parser object.  p  pI turned the Parser into a gem, thinking I could just bundle it with each of the clients, but Ive found out that some of the code in my gem doesnt work with MacRuby specifically named regex groups.  So I think my only other option is to run it as a service locally. Somehow this seems like overkill to me, is there any other way to isolate the functionality of a gem so that I can just pass a file path to it and have it do its thingp  pIn other words, is there a way to have my MacRuby app just somehow make a call to the external Parser app without having to run a local server and service.  And if I do create a service, should it just be as simple as calling localhostPORTparserpathwhateverpath and then call parser to get updates on progress like localhostPORTcurrentfile, etcp  pEDIT Would using JRuby to compile the Parser app be a good idea  That would give me the encapsulation I was looking for and allow me to include the app into MacRuby.p

Negative 121 pRecently, Spammers found worldwritable folders such as those needed by certain wordpress plugins and uploaded rogue .htaccess.php files to use my Ubuntu Linux 11.04 unmanaged VPS Linode as a proxy where from spam message links would arrive for redirection to other servers. p  pWhat I noticed was that these spambots do a recursive directory scan for writable directories presumably over port 80. The rogue files were actually uploaded via the wwwdata usergroup I dont have anonftp, or weak ssh, so Im assuming also via 80. p  pWhat I think Id really like is some sort of security mechanism which triggers an IP to get blacklisted via .htaccess as well as fire an email to me the moment an unauthorized IP addy decides to sneak an upload. p  pIm guessing that somehow a firewall daemon will be required for monitoring the IP information, but am unsure about how to conduct the blacklisting of the unauthorized IP addresses attempting to write to a directory. My gut would be to write a shell script which checks for log files created by the firewall, extract any offending IPs and write them into an .htaccess deny tag.   Would anyone kindly point me to anything that already accomplishes this, or help me get started with the proper resourcesp

Negative 121 pThis is my taskp  blockquote   pThe Knapsack Problem is a classic in computer science. In its simplest   form it involves trying to fit items of different weights into a   knapsack so that the knapsack ends up with a specified total weight.   You dont need to fit in all the items. For example, suppose you want   your knapsack to weigh exactly 20 pounds, and you have five items,   with weights of 11, 8, 7, 6, and 5 pounds. For small numbers of items,   humans are pretty good at solving this problem by inspection. So you   can probably figure out that only the 8, 7, and 5 combination of items   adds up to 20.p blockquote  pI really dont know where to begin writing this algorithm. I understand recursion when applied to factorials and triangle numbers. However Im lost right now.p

Negative 121 pI am working on a project using Synth for the UI and want to implement some custom buttons. The buttons need to make use of style settings from a synth XML settings file  e.g. font colors which are different for different states MOUSEOVER, PRESSED, etc.p  pThe problem Im stuck on is that some of the buttons need to have extra subcomponents  e.g. some need more than one label. I want the subcomponents to pick up the same style settings as the standard button subcomponents.p  pI feel like I ought to be able to just extend codeJButtoncode and overrideextend codepaintComponentcode to call the draw methods of some child components. Im a bit unsure about a few aspects of that approach though e.g. what parameters to pass to codepaintComponentcode and how to ensure the subcomponents get the correct Synth style settings particularly wrt. the states.p  pAn aside I have tried extending codeJPanelcode but have run into some difficulties with that approach see here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7768889jpanelstatesforsynthJPanel states for Syntha.p  pstrongEDITstrong So, Ive discovered that it is possible to add subcomponents to buttons and have them render correctly. It seems that even though codeJButton.getLayoutcode returns null, the button will use an codeOverlayLayoutcode unless you call codeJButton.setLayoutcode. Calling codeJButton.setLayoutnullcode does prevent the OverlayLayout being used, so thats how Im handling the layout.p  pIm looking into a couple of different approaches to updating the styles for the child controls, will report back on those later.p

Negative 121 pIm asking this with full knowledge that this idea is probably well covered in a subject unfamiliar to me. Suppose youre writing a small piece of code that takes an input of an arbitrary number of variables. Those variables can have several states, namelyp  ol liCorrect Datali liIncorrect Data outside range, improper formatting, whateverli liUnknown Nullli ol  pSo if we have 3 input variables, and 3 states per those variables, we end up with 27 possible scenarios. Suppose I have to do some logic based on the state of certain variables, or the combination of states AND, NAND, OR, etc. Can I easily structure a program in such a way that I provably cover all scenarios without an absolute mess of ifelse style logic The first thing that came to mind was statemachines, but after looking at them for a bit Im not entirely convinced its the same thing.p

Negative 121 pI am planning to make functionality that can test if a borehole is crossing a fault.

The core of this function is the followingp  precodeICoordinateReferenceSystem inputCRS  PetrelProject.PrimaryProject.CoordinateReferenceSystem SpatialUnitsPolicy unitsPolicy  SpatialUnitsPolicy.AllDataInSI SpatialContext spatialCtx  new SpatialContextinputCRS, unitsPolicy ISurfaceIntersectionService sis  CoreSystem.GetServiceltISurfaceIntersectionServicegtarguments.Surface foreach FaultInterpretationPolyline p in arguments.Fault.GetPolylines      IEnumerableltPolylineSurfaceIntersectiongt intersections  sis.GetSurfacePolyLineIntersectionarguments.Surface, p.Polyline     foreach PolylineSurfaceIntersection intersection in intersections          arguments.NumberOfIntersections       codepre  pThe above works fine and I was thinking I could make something along the same lines to compute the intersection between a polyline well trajectory and a surface generated from the collection of polylines representing the fault interpretation. The key question is, is there a way to getgenerate a surface from a collection of polylines The fault interpretation can be displayed as a surface triangulated, is this surface accessible from the api The surface returned from the api must be such that it can be used as an argument to ISurfaceIntersectionService. If this is not possible through the Ocean api, is there a way that the user could prepare the fault interpretation up front making surfaces from the fault interpretations Or maybe there is a complete different approach to solve the above in an efficient wayp

Negative 121 pI got a problem with validations between multiple fields.

The lpview is a root node, then there is a lplist node which having received some data source will produce a list first it will include content of lplistheader, then repeat proper times content of lplistitem replacing title by actual data, but this does not matter here, then it will add content of lplistfooter node. As you can see, for this reason I have html tag table splitting across my tags.p  pI have met two major problems here 1. Eclipse complains that table is not properly closed  I want Eclipse to stop complaining, treat this tag as a text or  maybe you can suggest something 2. Eclipse will not show any code hint if I am inside any of html tags. code hint attributes that maybe used by this tag like class or id etcp  pI understand that Im asking a weird freak question, but maybe there are some XSD gurus here who can direct me  Eclipse should treat my xml template file as the following 1. the tags prefixed lp are gods They have precedence over anything other. Only errors from that tags missing required attributes, missing required child elements etc should be displayed. 2. All the other tags any stuff in between angle brackets are HTML tags. Eclipse should display code hint for them, but should anything be incorrect like in my sample no closing table tag  Eclipse should not complain.p  pI hope this is possible.p  pthanksp

Negative 121 pId like to implement a feature whereby allowing a user to resize a DataGridView column, but without affecting the adjacent columns. Ive noticed in many programs that you can resize a specific column, and all the columns to the left or right will stay fixed in size. This is not the default behavior in .NET though, because when I expand a column, the columns to the right side will compress in equal amounts to account for the added size of the old column.p  pIs there a way to stop this from happeningp  pEDITp  pI obviously didnt explain that the best, so lets try this againp  pI have a DataTable that holds 8 columns, and a bunch of rows. I add that DataTable as the DataSource for the DataGridView. When my form opens up, the 8 columns are spread evenly across the DataTable, which is set to codeAutoSizeColumnsMode  System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.Fillcode. I want to keep the AutoSizeColumsMode this way. The form or the control will not be resized. Only the columns within the control.p  pWhat I want is for a user to be able to resize an individual column like, say, column 3 without it affecting the size of all the columns to the right of it. Default behavior is to resize all the other columns to accomodate for the new change. However, I would like it to only resize the column immediately to the right. This way, it wont screw up any custom sizes that were set on column 8.p  pI saw an application do this properly earlier today, though I wish I could remember which it was so I could take a screenshot. All I know is that when I resized one column in the middle of the table, it didnt change the width of all the columns to the right only the one immediately next to it.p

Negative 121 pIm working on a friends list type function that will display a users friends and Im having some logic problems. The way the table for storing friends is set up, there are 3 columns userid1, userid2 and friendstatus. A friendstatus of 1 indicates the users are friends, status of 0 indicates a request is pending. When a user adds another user to be their friend, the user who sends the request is placed in userid1, and the user who receives the request is placed in userid2.p  pSo, the issue that Im having is getting the function to properly select the users friends, not the user himself.

Negative 121 pConsider a large scale application that  uses a table in a  sql server database to schedule jobs Each row in the table is tagged with a queueID, a methodName and other meta data. The methodName may be a native dot net interface, a legacy com local interface,  a 3rd party com interface or URI to a 3rd party web service.p  pCurrently there is a family of 32bit background exes that process each queueID. There is a set max time limit on how long each job can run set by the queueID, a watchdog will kill the process if the time limit is exceeded.p  pWe want to move this to a 64 bit environment amp consolidate the multiple background exe process into a single multithreaded windows service.p  pThe issue is how do we handle the kill of a job that exceeds the set time limit. If we assign a task for each queueID from a Task Parallel Library from a single appDomain primary thread Clearly net4.0 cancellation tokens cant be used since the thread may run a com interface or  a 3rd party web service. If the appDomain watchdog task calls Thread.abort it may corrupt the entire appDomain amp tear down all task threads I am unclear if Thread.Interrupt would reliably cancel a thread without appDomain corruption.p  pSo what is the suggested technique to kill a thread that has exceeded the time limitsp  pORp  pDo we just have the service create an AppDomain for each queueID then do  myAppDomain1.ExecuteAssemblyqueueProcess.exe arg1 myAppDomain2.ExecuteAssemblyqueueProcess.exe arg2 ... almost the same arch that exists now but its a win service that controls the appDomains and each queueProcess.exe amp then use a the tpl thread pool do run the jobs in a set of smaller pools in each queueProcess.exe amp the watch dog just does AppDomain.Unload when a process has exceeded its time limitp

Obviously Id like adless search on my site for free if at all possiblep  pIve also heard about LuceneSolr, but they do not actually emcrawlem the site. For that I would apparently need Nutch.p  pAnyway, the site I have runs on a Microsoft IIS6 server, but I have basically no knowledge as to how Solr, Nutch, etc. gets installed on the server.p  pstrongAlsostrong Id like to point out that I do have a local copy of the site.

Negative 121 pIm trying to push my tests in inter activity communications and check that for example after a correct login, I spawn the right activity from 2 possibles activities.p  pHeres what my code looks like  p  precodeRunWithGuiceRobolectricJUnitRunner.class public class LoginActivityTest  Inject private LoginActivity activity Inject private ExplorerActivity startedActivity  Inject private Context context  private Button loginButton private EditText login private EditText password  Before public void setUp throws Exception      activity.onCreatenull     loginButton  Button activity.findViewByIdR.id.identificationloginbutton     login  EditText activity.findViewByIdR.id.txtLogin     password  EditText activity.findViewByIdR.id.txtPassword    Online Test public void shouldExploreWhenLoginIsCorrect throws Exception      assertNotNullactivity     login.setTexttesttest.com     password.setTexttest     activity.setIntentnew Intent     loginButton.performClick     ShadowActivity shadowActivity  Robolectric.shadowOfactivity     Intent startedIntent  shadowActivity.getNextStartedActivity     ShadowIntent shadowIntent  Robolectric.shadowOfstartedIntent     assertEqualsshadowIntent.getIntentClass, ExplorerActivity.class       startedActivity.setIntentstartedIntent       startedActivity.onCreatenull         codepre  pMy problem is that I cant retrieve the started activity from the shadowintent.

Negative 121 pWe have an controller method that is being called twice. The first time it is called we get the correct parameters, the second time it is called we get no parameters and the MVC engine throws an exception because the arguments to the method cannot be null.p  pWe have seen this behaviour before when using certain versions of Safari and it was to do with  authentication. When using windows authentication if the properties of the authentication in IIS were set to Negotiate and NTLM an ajax call would get sent once for each. The fix for this was to remove one I think we just left it as NTLM. This is not the case as we are using forms authentication here.p  pWe have also seen similar behaviour when calling WCF methods that were returning types that were derived and not using the KnownType attributes on the parent class.p  pWe cannot reproduce this with any success its happening infrequently on a clients machine and are looking for any general gotchas.p

Negative 121 pIn Java, you can listen for keymouse events generated by the user keyboardmouse. Also, Java allows you to generate keymouse events using the codejava.awt.Robotcode, and these events can be captured by the same listeners.

I examined codeevent.getSourcecode, but it seem that the event source for both is the same frame. Any other way to tell which one triggered the eventp  pstrongEditstrong Since this question is closed cannot answer it, and the duplicate is not the answer. You can detect Robot events generated by your own application by setting a flag multiple flags if needed before generating the event using Robot, then check them when an event happen in the listener and rest them after handling them. This is not the best way, but it is possible. I was looking for a better way since it was in the same context of the application, but the one who closed the question made a rushed decision closing the question  p

Negative 121 pI have an Entity class and a deriving Item class that holds some additional stuff. I am working on creating something with which I can patch such objects ie apply a diff to them. What I currently have is an EntityPatcher class that transforms an Entity object into an associative array and then feeds this into a generic patching utility using composition. This works great for Entity objects, but for Item objects some additional fields need to be held into account. What I started doing is creating a deriving ItemPatcher class that holds some additional stuff. This class would only be able to work with Items though, thus narrowing what the patch method accepts. Which I guess is bad, since it violates liskov substitution. Im not sure what would be a better approach though, and am thus looking for suggestions or pointers to alternate solutions.p  pEntityPatcher a hrefhttppastebin.comCYa3ehH4 relnofollowhttppastebin.comCYa3ehH4ap  pItemPatcher a hrefhttppastebin.com3BReBZGH relnofollowhttppastebin.com3BReBZGHap

The storefetch functions do not need any additional state for codeintcode types, the readwrite implementation is very simple.p  pHowever, for codeNoteNumberArraycode, state is necessary so I create my own class instead of using core types or STL types. This state is used by the implementation of codeItemSerializercode emonlyem, for optimization purposes. This private state would be used to optimize the speed and efficiency of the readwrite methods. Since the serializer classes are not stateful, I put this state in the user object instead.p  pI could probably make codeItemSerializercode a friend of codeNoteNumberArraycode, but this would cause a circular dependency and gives codeItemSerializercode access to more of codeNoteNumberArraycode than might be necessary.p  pWhat is a good design for such a system Just looking for some tips to help me get started.

This will prevent the user doing anything else in my application until I finished the long operation, however if they click cancel it should stop the operation.p  pI tried creating a simple NSWindowController based window with a cancel button and making the window modal, like so....br br void startlongoperation br ...br ...br [self showBusy]br  return  return to continue the long operationbr br br br  throw up a busy dialog box so user cant do anything until donebr void showBusy br     BusyNSWindow loadingView  [[LoadingView alloc] initWithWindowNibNameLoadingView]br     [[NSApplication sharedApplication] runModalForWindowloadingView.window]br br br br  if cancel clicked, signal to stop long operation, close busy dialog boxbr IBAction cancel br br  cancel was clicked inside the busy dialog box so signal process to stop long operationbr br brp  pbut what happens is that it stays inside the [[NSApplication sharedApplication] runModalForWindowloadingView.window] and doesnt return.

This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your applications project, when using an IDE such as Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats going on.  However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality.  If you really intend to build a core library  which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.  If you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem.  If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation. codepre  pI dont know what is the problem i have followed a hrefhttpchrismweb.com20111018howtostartcreatingandroidgamesusingthelibgdxgamedevelopmentframework relnofollowthis tutoriala for getting started. can someone point out whats this error is all about.

Negative 121 pI am building a website which can be viewed here a hrefhttpwww.argit.bounde.co.uk relnofollowargit.bounde.co.ukap  pI have done the majority of the content and I am now trying to work on the navigation. I have three navigation bars only one is ever visible and need this method to work no matter which is showing. If you resize your browser to make your window narrower that will show a second, and then when you scroll the navigation that appears is a third. p  pI have got it working to a fashion but the problem is when I click a link it jumps to where it wants to go momentarily, then returns and then scrolls as it is meant to. This is because of the hreftarget that i have left in the nav. I have tried including a return false but then if the broswer doesnt support JS then the navigation doesnt work at all.p  pThe next problem is I want a way to make the target over. Currently when you click a link it scrolls to the selected one and the nav updates which link is over as it passes them. I want this for when the user is scrolling up and down the page, but if they click a link I want that link to be over and the respective links from other navigations and not be affected by the scroll checks that would normally override it. p  pThe solution I am using for my onClick navigation is below, I know there are plug ins that will do this kind of thing but I want to write it myself so i can get a better understanding of jQuery. Im not sure if the solution I am using at the moment is a good one, if not please advise mep  precodefunction navigation       html, body.stop.animate         scrollTop this.attrhref.offset.top     , 1500  codepre  pThe solution I am using for the scrolling checks I found by accident and is below, It works by over riding the equation above it and is actually quite simple.

Negative 121 pI have a level I need to render. It is broken into hundreds of submeshes with information on which submesh can see which submesh.

I have been trying to figure out the best way to go about optimizing rendering and eliminate all unnecissary texture swaps. If I just sort the VBO, I lose the submesh connections and the visibility data becomes useless. Or is there a better way to do thatp  pOr should i create an index list every frame based on visibility or is that too slowp  pEdit Here is a breakdown of my current setup.p  pVBO with all of the vertices in order running from submesh 1 texture 1, submesh 1 texture 2, all the way to submesh n, texture n.p  pI have an IBO which is just all of the indices to all of the meshes, in the same relative order.p  pWhen I render, I consult the submesh and have an starting index and count which are the start index in the IBO for that submesh and texture and then the count which is the number that have that texture.p  pThis is essentially why I am doing so much swapping which is really slowing things down.p

Negative 121 pI am new to Cocoa Programming. So this may be an easy to solve Question.br I am playing around with Cocoa Bindings at the moment. And have a simple set up. p  pI have two windows with separate .xib files and WindowController Classes.br Each window has a TextField that is bound to the same ClassObject, that contains an NSString.  p  pIf I change the value on TextField in the first window, nothing happens and the TextField in the second window is not updated.br If I put a label in the first window, and bind its value all is working fine, and the labels value change when I change the TextField in the same window.p  pHow do I get the TextField in the second window to update itself, when I change the Value in the first windows TextFieldbr The only way I get this to work is when I bind the TextFields to NSUserDefaultsController. But storing the data is not what I am looking for. p  pI was searching the web, but could not find a proper solution, so any help is welcome.br Thanksp

Negative 121 pI have the following code which creates WPF controls and then adds them to a window in a fashion I need. It works decently, but when trying to create 256 x4  two textblocks, combo box, textbox controls it takes a while to display the tab. Window loads fine but I have many tabs and when I click on point setup tab it lags a little before displaying the tab. It only lags the first time I click on the tab, every time after the first it responds immediately.p  pAt first I thought it was a rendering issue, but after much other research I am of the impression CWPF doesnt do well with creating a bunch of objects on the fly and adding them to forms.p  pIf I drop the number of items to 50 it responds immediately, 100 is a slight lag and 200 256 is a little more of a lag and too much to be acceptable to users.p  pAny experiences with issues like this before and advice for how to fix it or other tipstricks.p  pThanks in advance Wesleyp  precodepublic static void pointSetupVirtualizingStackPanel desc, VirtualizingStackPanel map Draws point description and point map table in point setup tab              StackPanel row         TextBlock text         TextBox textBox         ComboBox comboBox          Thickness rowSpacing  new Thickness0, 0, 0, 5         Thickness textSpacing  new Thickness0, 3, 5, 3         Listltstringgt list  new Listltstringgt          list.Addxx         for byte i  0 i lt Global.currentZonesToMap i                      list.AddZone    i  1                   for short i  0 i lt 256 i                      desc             row  new StackPanel             row.Margin  rowSpacing             row.Orientation  Orientation.Horizontal              text  new TextBlock             text.Text  Point   i  1             text.Margin  textSpacing             text.Width  50              textBox  new TextBox             textBox.MaxLength  28             textBox.Text               textBox.Width  270              row.Children.Addtext             row.Children.AddtextBox              desc.Children.Addrow              map             row  new StackPanel             row.Margin  rowSpacing             row.Orientation  Orientation.Horizontal              text  new TextBlock             text.Text  Point   i  1             text.Margin  textSpacing             text.Width  50              comboBox  new ComboBox             comboBox.ItemsSource  list             comboBox.Width  270              row.Children.Addtext             row.Children.AddcomboBox              map.Children.Addrow               codepre  pNew Code using DataTemplate and ItemsControlp  precode    public class DevicePoint              public string desc  get set           public int zone  get set           public Listltstringgt zones  get set            Initialized all variables and displays UI constructor     public Dispatcher              InitializeComponent          Listltstringgt opts  new Listltstringgt         opts.Addxx         for byte i  0 i lt Global.currentZonesToMap i                      opts.AddZone    i  1                   ListltDevicePointgt points  new ListltDevicePointgt         for short i  0 i lt 256 i             points.Addnew DevicePoint  desc  Point   i  1, zone  0, zones  opts          pointDesc.ItemsSource  points         pointZoneMap.ItemsSource  points          ... other stuff here ...               ltStackPanelgt                 ltTextBlock Margin10 FontWeightBold HorizontalAlignmentCenter TextPoint Descriptions gt                 ltScrollViewer Width360 Margin30,10,30,10 MaxHeight405gt                     ltItemsControl NamepointDesc Margin5gt                         ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt                             ltDataTemplategt                                 ltStackPanel VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizingTrue Margin0,0,0,5 OrientationHorizontalgt                                     ltTextBlock Margin0,3,5,3 Width50 TextBinding desc gt                                     ltTextBox MaxLength28 Width270 TextBinding desc gt                                 ltStackPanelgt                             ltDataTemplategt                         ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt                     ltItemsControlgt                 ltScrollViewergt             ltStackPanelgt             ltStackPanel Grid.Column1gt                 ltTextBlock Margin10 FontWeightBold HorizontalAlignmentCenter TextPoint  Zone Map gt                 ltScrollViewer Width360 Margin30,10,30,10 MaxHeight405gt                     ltItemsControl NamepointZoneMap Margin5gt                         ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt                             ltDataTemplategt                                 ltStackPanel VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizingTrue Margin0,0,0,5 OrientationHorizontalgt                                     ltTextBlock Margin0,3,5,3 Width50 TextBinding desc gt                                     ltComboBox Width270 ItemsSourceBinding zones SelectedIndexBinding zone gt                                 ltStackPanelgt                             ltDataTemplategt                         ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt                     ltItemsControlgt                 ltScrollViewergt             ltStackPanelgt codepre

Negative 121 pI am using WIC to load in an image and then I want to be able to get the RGB values of each pixel. I have got as far as using stronggetDataPointerstrong to create a strongbytestrong buffer which I cast to a strongCOLORREFstrong array but after this things get strange.p  pI have a 10x10 24bit png that Im testing with. If I look at the strongsizestrong value stronggetDataPointerstrong gives me it says its 300, which makes sense because 10  10  3 for 3 bytes per pixel  300. If I do stronggetStridestrong it gives me 30, which also makes sense.p  pSo I create a loop to go through the strongCOLORREFstrong with an iterator and the condition is strongi lt size3strong because I know there are only 100 pixels in the array. I then use the macros strongGetRValuestrong, strongGetGValuestrong and strongGetBValuestrong to get the rgb values out.p  pThis is when things go weird  My small image is just a test image with solid red, green, blue and black pixels in, but my RGB values come out 255, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 27, 255, 36, 0, 0, 0 etc. it seems that some values dont come out properly and are corrupted somehow. Also, the last 2030 pixels of the image are either loads of crazy colors or all black making me think there some sort of corruption.p  pI also tested it with a larger actual photograph and this comes out all grayscale and repeating the same pattern, making me think its a stride issue but I dont understand how because when I call stronggetPixelFormatstrong WIC says its 24bppBGR or 24bppRGB depending on the images.p  pDoes anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong Shouldnt I be using COLORREF and the macros or something like thatp  pThanks for your time.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHmm Ive still got a problem here. I tried with another 24bit PNG that PixelFormat was reporting as 24bppBGR but it seems like the stride is off or something because it is drawing as skewed obligatory nyan cat testp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAkOq5.png altTest WIC load with nyan cat but the stride is offp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pOkay so now it seems I have some that work and some that dont. Some reporting themselves as 24bpp BGR work while others look like the image above and if I calculate the stride it gives me compared to what it should be they are different and also the size of the buffer is different too.

That sounds a little controversial so I thought Id turn to stackoverflow for help.p  pThe core code for the sample is below  p  precodeltWindow xClassComboBoxTest.MainWindow          xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation          xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         TitleMainWindow Height150 Width525gt     ltDockPanelgt         ltButton ClickReloadModel Width137 Height40gtReload ModelltButtongt         ltComboBox NameComboBox              ItemsSourceBinding AvailableOptions              SelectedItemBinding SelectedOption              Width235 Height43gt         ltComboBoxgt     ltDockPanelgt ltWindowgt  public partial class MainWindow  Window      public MainWindow              InitializeComponent         var newModel  new ViewModel         ComboBox.DataContext  newModel           private void ReloadModelobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e                      var newModel  new ViewModel         ComboBox.DataContext  newModel        public class ViewModel  INotifyPropertyChanged      public ViewModel          thisnew[]  Option 1, Option 2, Option 3             public ViewModelIEnumerableltstringgt options              selectedOption  options.First         availableOptions  new ObservableCollectionltstringgtoptions           protected void RaisePropertyChangedstring propertyName              var propertyChangedHandler  PropertyChanged         if propertyChangedHandler  null                      propertyChangedHandlerthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName                   public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged      private readonly ObservableCollectionltstringgt availableOptions     public ObservableCollectionltstringgt AvailableOptions              get                      return availableOptions                    private string selectedOption     public string SelectedOption              get  return selectedOption          set                      if selectedOption  value                              return                          selectedOption  value             RaisePropertyChangedSelectedOption                codepre  pSteps to reproducebr 1 Run Applicationbr 2 Open Combobox  so that it renders the drop down optionsbr 3 Click Reload Model button  p  pAt this point there will be be two ViewModel objects, the older, unexpected instance is rooted like ViewModelPopupRootPopupComboBoxMainWindowAppp  pIs this a bug or am I doing it wrongp  pEamonp

Negative 121 pI have an asp.net .net 3.5 website running on two Windows 2008 servers with IIS 7.  The web server contains the UI code, which calls the wcf web services on the app server.  These wcf services then make calls to an Oracle database.p  pMy problem is that local user profiles are being created in CUsers on the app server.  These local user profiles have the same name of user on the website.  I noticed that this happens when users change their password on the website.  Having a local user profile for every account on the website is now taking up a lot of spacep  pDoes anybody have any idea why this might be happening and how I can stop it  I have searched and searched and I could only find one person with the same problem as me on the windows forums.  Unfortunately, nobody answered hisher post.  Hopefully I have better luck here p  pAt first I thought it might work if I turned off the load user profile setting in IIS for all my app pools, but that didnt solve the problem.  strongEditstrong I think this setting is responsible for created user profiles for the app pools and not the actual website users.p  pIm considering changing the Allow log on locally setting in the Local Security Policy of the app server and removing Users because I think only Administrators need this right.

Negative 121 pI am working on a TUNbased VPN server whose goal is to analyze packets it receives before forwarding them to their destination. Currently I am receiving the IP packets from a TUN interface, and simply sending them off to their destination unmodified.p  pI understand that analyzing the content of UDP packets would be as simple as stripping the IP and UDP headers. However, to analyze the contents of TCP traffic, I would need to reconstruct the message from multiple IP packets. Is there an easy way to do this without reimplementing TCP Are there any easily accessible CC libraries meant for this task I would prefer Linux system libraries andor opensource, nonviralnoncopyleft libraries.p  pOne thing I have already considered is making a copy of each IP packet, and changing the destination IP of the copy to localhost, so that a different part of my server may receive these TCP requests and responses fully reconstructed and without headers. However, I would not be able to associate destination IPs with traffic content, which is something that I desire.p

But what about memory consumption when I call codeisInstanceCreatedcode. When I instantiate class with codeNewcode or codeclass.fornamecode and instance is created and memory is allocated for the hole class right. When i call codeisInstanceCreatedcode are the entire class also taking up memory nobody can access the nonstatic stuff of course becuase it need instantiating first.

Negative 121 pIm working on a project for school and Im having some trouble here. I am to go through a file for a trivia game. The format of the file is as follows The first line of the file will be the category of the questions, the following lines will be pairs of questions and answers. Until it hits a blank line, that indicates that the next line after the blank line starts a new category and it goes on. I am supposed to make an ArrayList that will have 6 indexes. One for each category, then in each of the indexes i should have groups of questions and answers that I will be able to utilize for comparison. I guess essentially an array inside of an arraylist.

Negative 121 pThis is such a fundamental MVC question I have a feeling the answer is already on SO and I just cant find it. Please forgive me if its a dupe.p  pI am reimplementing a big legacy JSPservlet app in JSF2Spring3Facelets. I think in general we want to leave the presentation formatting to the .xhtml and use the backing bean to make the data suitable for display. This makes for a nice separation of concerns even though I believe both are part of the View. However, the legacy app has an attractive table that contains headings on the left and HTML formatted stuff on the right, like links that pop up a dialog only one row has this. I decided to put all the content in objects that a datatable iterates through and it worked but I found myself putting sort of ugly HTML for links and such in the backing bean, and putting ugly conditions in the datatable e.g. if this is row 0, then use this CSS class. This works but it doesnt feel right. Ive very tightly coupled the backing bean to the presentation, but I cant think of a simple way to get around it. Does anyone have any guidelines around how to handle this Thanks in advance.p

Negative 121 pIm writing an app in CWPF .Net framework 4.0. The one thing I am having a problem with is how to update controls, if possible, while the app is very busy. I think Im just flailing about trying things I find on the web to make it work and on rare occasions it does. The app has four classes, a main window class, a Worker1 class and a Worker2 class and a static ExtensionMethods class. Worker2 is called from Worker1 and does most of the work. When it runs the CPU is at 100 core at 100, system has four cores.  All are in the same namespace.p  precodepublic static class ExtensionMethods      private static Action EmptyDelegate  delegate        public static void Refreshthis UIElement uiElement               uiElement.Dispatcher.InvokeSystem.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Render, EmptyDelegate       codepre  pThe main window calls a top level function in Worker1, which goes through some setup and then starts the long process, which goes something like thisp  precodeMainWindow mainWindow  App.Current.MainWindow as MainWindow mainWindow.dispatcherUpdateProgressBarMaximummaxValue int count0 Worker2 worker2  new Worker2 while bytesRead readData 0      count     worker2.doWork     mainWindow.dispatcherUpdateProgressBarcount   codepre  pIn the mainWindow class is p  precodedispatcherUpdateProgressBarint Value  Dispatcher.BeginInvokenew Action gt myProgressBar.Value  value, null         myProgressBar.Refresh  codepre  pI have also tried it with myProgressBar.Dispatcher.Begin...etc.p  pbut neither matter too much. With small files where there are 2 or 3 reads I can see the progress bar getting updated. But with large files, no update until the end. This happens also for some label controls in which I display some status information. After the entire work is completed I optionally display a messagebox of what was done. For the labels, when I display the messagebox, the labels are updated. The app may work on many files one after the other.p  pIve thought about using a background thread but not sure how to do it. That is, the worker2.doWork section is very intensive but if thats on its own thread the the mainWindow.dispatcherUpdate...will be called immediately after the thread begins and theres nothing to stop the next read from happening, right p  pPerhaps its impossible the way Ive coded it. IF I used a Backgroundworker, would the class be instantiated in the Main Window or Worker1 Even a pointer or two would be great.p

Negative 121 pI use Symfony2 to build a website that will request data from a web service. Requests are made from the server not the client.

My website has a good few images, as such I want to have say a loading bar that as my browser receives and image it moves the bar x pixels to the right. Now the css behind it all isnt to bad.

Negative 121 pBasic idea Given an array, find all the permutations of that array. Then, take each of those arrays and put it all together. Eg the array 6,5,3,4,1,2 gives you 653412. The permutations work, but I cannot get the integers.p  precodeint main     int myints[]  2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  int k  int dmartin0  int powof101  stdcout ltlt The 8 possible permutations with 8 elementsn  do       fork0 klt8 k         stdcout ltlt myints[k] ltlt           dmartinmyints[8k1]powof10dmartin         powof10powof1010          cout ltlt n  ltlt dmartin ltlt n       while  stdnextpermutationmyints,myints8     dmartin0   return 0  codepre  pI also have some code that works when you just have one array, but in this case there are thousands. I though I needed to reset dmartin0 at the end of each while loop so that it didnt keep adding to the previous answer, however when I tried that I got 0 for each of my answers. Without trying to reset, I get answers that seem random and are negative.p

Negative 121 pI have a recursive method that visits every node in a tree hierarchy and triggers a callback for every node, like code below is not tested and an examplep  precodevoid VisitNode node, FuncltNode, intgt callback, CancellationToken ct    ifct.IsCancellationRequested        return       var processedNode  DoSomeProcessingnode    int result  callbackprocessedNode     Do something important with the returned int.   ...

Negative 121 pI am trying to make an Eraser for my codefabricjscodebased 0.5 Opacity free drawing appwith nontrivial background image, i. e. everything drawing is halftransparent and we still can see the background through the free drawing. p  pHowever I understand by default all free drawing are pathbased i. e. everything we draw between mousedown mouse up is captured as an individual path in the canvas, so it is not possible to erase arbitrary part of the path. So I am thinking maybe we can capture the mousedownup event manually and draw an image pixie by pixie and place it on the canvas with opacity0.5 so that we can use white to overwrite all those old drawing p  pIs this a workableefficient enough solution p  pHowever I am not sure how this can be implemented in codefabricjscode could you please give me some advise on the steps or some pseudocode thanks p

Negative 121 pSimilar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20366892resizinghandlesonarotatedelementResizing Handles on a Rotated Elementa, Im implementing a way for the user to scale an Image through handles in codelibGDXcode. A problem I keep bumping into is the scaling of the Image. I currently use a hrefhttpscode.google.complibgdxwikiscene2d relnofollowcodeScene2Dcodea which I used to create a codeGroupcode which contains the Image and 8 handles around the Image. The positions of the handles are defined relative to the Image. This works fine for rotation and translation, but not for scaling. When the codeGroupcode gets rescaled, so does the handle. But because of the scaling, the offset between the handle and the image is not the same anymore. I hacked around a bit to be able to draw the handles at the correct place even with scaling. But the problem is the bounds of the Handles. This is important for the mouse to be able to select the correct region which is also a rectangle. After setting the bounds, these are transformed and the scaling messes with the handles size and location. Is using a codeGroupcode a dead end Are there better ways to handle this problemp  pIn short I want handles to be placed around an Image to rescale it. The handles position has to move correctly with any transformation on the Image and the handles size has to remain intact.p  pA solution might be to avoid the scaling by resizing the width and height yourself. This however doesnt scale the codeActorscode within the codeGroupcode as you would expect.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWP73S.gif altexample representation of resize handlesp

Negative 121 pI am using transform to rotate images in my app, and it has been working fine up until iOS 7.1 was fine in iOS 7. With iOS 7.1, when the image is rotated, I get odd unintentional lines showing up. The lines are not always static i.e., they change, even when my code is not specifically doing any animations. Here is an example. The fancy cloud to the left is the jpg Im using. The vertical black line to the right is not something Ive intentionally drawn. Note that this is a picture not a screen grab because screen grabs dont seem to capture the effect.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCJC6T.png altenter image description herep  pHeres an example of the transform Im using on self a UIImageView subclassp  precode    self.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeRotationself.rotation codepre  pIm also using a shadow for this UIImageView subclassp  precode    self.layer.shadowOffset  CGSizeMake0, 1     self.layer.shadowOpacity  1     self.layer.shadowColor  [UIColor blackColor].CGColor codepre  pWhen I comment out these three lines of shadow code, the issue goes away.

Negative 121 pI am working on an app that currently stores user passwords in plaintext.  After a bit of research, I decided to opt for SHA3 from the cryptojs library to accomplish this task.

Unity, however, immediately throws a compile errorp  precodeAssetsScriptsStartMenusha3.js7,46 BCE0043 Unexpected token ,. codepre  pGoogling the error yields various issues with syntacticly incorrect code.  My research led me to believe that cryptojs was the goto implementation for js, so I doubt theres an issue with the library.  Does Unity differ greater in its JS implementation  What am I missingp

Negative 121 pI have an android app, which needs to fetch new data from a server running a MySQL database. I add data to the database via a Panel which I access online on my codedomain.commypanelcode. p  pWhat would be the best way to fetch the data on the client to reduce the overhead, but keep the programming effort as small as possible. Its strongnotstrong necessary for the client to get the latest database changes right after they have been updated, i.e. it would be okay if the client is updated some hours after the update.p  pCurrently I thought of the followingp  ol liAdd a column codetimestampcode to the databasetables so that I know which changes have been madeli liRun some sort of background service on the client in the app which runs every X hours and then checks for the latest updates since the last successfull serverclient synchronizationli liSend the timegap to the server in which there havent been any updates on the client anymore, using HTTPPOSTli liOn the server, there will be some sort of MySQL codeSELECTcodestatement which considers the sent timegap if there is no timegap sent from the client, just SELECT everything, e.g. in case of the first synchronization fullsync  JSONEncode the Arrays  Sent the JSON Response to the Clientli liOn the client, take the data, loop row by row and insert into the local database fileli ol  pstrongMy question would bestrong p  pIs there something you would rather do differently  Or would you maybe send the database changes as a whole packagesqlfile instead of the rawdata as arrayp  pWhat would happen, when the internet connection aborts during the synchronization I thought of the following to avoid any conflicts in this sort of process Only after successfull retrieve of the complete serverresponse i.e. the complete JSONarray, strongONLYstrong then insert the rows into the local database and update the local update timestamp to the actual time. If Ive retrieved only some of the JSON rows and the internet connection gets interrupted inbetween or app is being killed, I would NOT have inserted ANY of the retrieved rows into my local appdatabase, which means that the next time the background service is running, there will hopefully be no conflicts.p  pThank you very muchp

Negative 121 pI have a a hrefhttpsgithub.comKennethAdamMillerTulipDevSetup relnofollowscript that Im using to compilea a Qt based graphics library, called tulip. Just FYI, you can also download a tulip distribution from their sourceforge a hrefhttpssourceforge.netprojectsauber relnofollowherea. You can then look around insidefor  ApplicationsTulip 4.5Contentslib and ApplicationsTulip 4.5libpython, which each of DYLDLIBRARYPATH and PYTHONPATH respectively should be set to. If you did that you could then skip to running the minimal code examplep  pYou can easily download it and run it to compile tulip against arbitrary versions of qt, the script fails only on Qt5.1.0 and probably earlier, I think its a stdc11 kind of thing. Just make sure you have Qt installed. Youll probably need to change the prefix to what you need it to be, and you need python3.4, but other than that its easy to make it work if you get any errors, I will figure out whats wrong, so dont hesitate to report.p  pThe following minimal set of actions exactly reproduces the problem that Im having once you get tulip itself compiledp  precodegtgtgt from tulip import  gtgtgt from tulipgui import  loadPlugins info UserskennethadammillerLibraryApplication SupportPythonpluginslibtulip  No such file or directory gtgtgt g  tlp.newGraph gtgtgt n  g.addNode gtgtgt view  tlpgui.createNodeLinkDiagramViewg codepre  pWhen you view the result, you should get something like belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI8m96.png altscreenshot.p  pThe problem is, why will it only use the lower left quadrant of the Gl view How do I get it to use all of it As you can see in the photo, the node which in this case is supposed to be a circle, is being cut off at exactly half the width and height of the containing window I really want the whole window. In contrast, Ive built this exact same setup on my linux vm, and it simply doesnt give me any of this trouble.p  pemEdit 1em I just confirmed that this isnt caused by the Debug cmake flag. I recompiled and it still is occurring.p  pemEdit 2em I just singled out that compiling using qt 4.8.5 eliminates this error completely. So its a difference between Qt 4.8.5 and qt version  5 that is causing this.p

Negative 121 pI am working on an enterprisescale project on which JavaFX 8 was choosen as the frontend technology. Target platform is a windowsbased tablet, so performance is even more likely to be an issue on this.p  pThe application is made up of dozens of screens essentially forms and it was decided to splitup the GUI description into a myriad of FXML files, in a kind of componentbased approach some subpanes inside a screen will be defined in their own fxml for instance. Also Spring is used to plug the controllers and services inside said components.p  pThe main problem is that now, 200 fxml are loaded at startup for a client application and it takes around 20 seconds to do so... which is a bit too noticeable p  pIve already ruled out Spring overhead as the culprit we have a Springaware codeFXMLLoadercode implementation but most of the time is spent inside the codeloadcode method.p  pI wonder if this is the right approach... Is there an scalability issue in loading too many FXML files A recommended limit on the number of fxml to attempt to load  granularity of fxml in a JavaFX app p  pAny tips or similarsituation feedback for this performance problem are welcome Thank you.p

Negative 121 pI have a straightforward codeUIPageViewControllercode with 30 pages where each page has a codeUIImageViewcode and accompanying codeUIImagecode which is loaded with codeUIImage.FromFile..code. I ensured that there are no references to any of the pages being held in memory or by the codeUIPageViewDataSourcecode once the user navigates forward through the pages. p  pWhat Im seeing is that when the user navigates forward, the destructor and codeDisposeboolcode methods are being called for the codeUIViewControllercode of each page and for the codeUIImageViewcode within the page as expected. However, when I run this test on hardware attached to Instruments, even though the codeIDisposablecode methods are being called, the memory is not being reclaimed. After a certain threshold of live bytes is reached, a lot of the memory consumed by the pages which have been garbage collected is then reclaimedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGaju6.png altInstruments screenshot illustrating the problem p  pWhy am I not seeing the memory being reclaimed immediately i.e. when the codeIDisposablecode methods are called p

So they are pretty much no use to me.p  pWhat Im trying to accomplish is when any moving div reaches magnifier area  it triggers creation of a clone that overlays original div and css transformation is applied to the clone lets say it is scaling 2x it must also have proportional speed change so things look smooth  for example original div is 100px wide and will slide inside magnifying area for 2 seconds so its speed is 50px per second  his clone will be 200px wide so it must slide 100px per 1 second and etc. . Note that all this actions are only visible in the magnifier area. When the clone div reaches the end of magnifier area it must be removed. p  pIve created a fiddle to make more sense.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4mTMw770 relnofollowFIDDLEap  pThe codep  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv classscrollgt ltdiv classscrollcontentgt     ltimg srchttpdummyimage.com96x96f0f0f0626262.pngamptext2gtltimggt      ltimg srchttpdummyimage.com96x96f0f0f0626262.pngamptext2gtltimggt     Text sample 1     ltimg srchttpdummyimage.com96x96f0f0f0626262.pngamptext2gtltimggt     ltimg srchttpdummyimage.com96x96f0f0f0626262.pngamptext2gtltimggt     ltimg srchttpdummyimage.com96x96f0f0f0626262.pngamptext2gtltimggt     Text sample 2      ltimg srchttpdummyimage.com96x96f0f0f0626262.pngamptext2gtltimggt     Text sample 3 ltdivgt codepre  pp    pCSSp  precodediv.scroll  margintop 200px marginleft 100px whitespacenowrap overflowhidden   div.scroll gt div.scrollcontent  whitespacenowrap displayinline margintop 20px marginleft 50 px widthauto   zoom   position absolute     top 150px     left 150px height 200px width 200px border solid colorred borderwidth 3px borderradius 155px    div.clone  whitespacenowrap displayinline margintop 20px marginleft 50 px widthauto  codepre  pNow the hard part  my code is missing triggers for beginning and ending so I divided into separate parts.p  pjQueryp  precode this scrolls original divs  function scoll var scroll  div.scroll scroll.eachfunction  var mar  this,indent  mar.width mar.scroll  function      indent     mar.csstextindent,indent     if indent lt 1  mar.childrendiv.scrollcontent.width          indent  mar.width       mar.datainterval,setIntervalmar.scroll,160   codepre  pThis should clone original divs with css transformation, however I cant figure out how to set the trigger.

Negative 121 pI was able to set up PHPUnit and do some basic testing from a workbench package, but I found I couldnt use my workbench facade or do any testing of any method that used Illuminate components for instance, my test for getting something using codeConfiggetcode was failing because the app hadnt really been started yet, so that facade didnt exist. I read around a few sites and saw that the Orchestral Testbench package should be able to bootstrap the app on the CLI and allow for that kind of testing, so I installed it in my main app codecomposer.jsoncode file and ran codecomposer update orchestratestbenchcode. Everything installed fine, apparently. My workbench package works just fine  both the service provider and the facade are set up in codeappconfigapp.phpcode and my test route that calls the facade and outputs a dummy string in my package config file works as expected. So I know the workbench package is set up correctly, which means my test must be set up wrong. Heres my anonymized test filep  precodeclass FrameworkTests extends OrchestraTestbenchTestCase      protected function getPackageProviders              return arrayMyVendorMyPackage           protected function getPackageAliases              return array             MyVendor gt MyVendorFacade                    public function testGetConfigValue              thisgtassertStringStartsWithfoo, MyPackagegetConfigValue       codepre  pWhen I run codephpunitcode from the CLI, I get this errorp  pcodeFatal error Class MyVendorMyPackage not found in hometmountjrprojectsmyprojectworkbenchmyvendormypackagevendorlaravelframeworksrcIlluminateFoundationProviderRepository.php on line 158codep  pI have no idea where to go from here, nor what files to look at. Unless Im doing something very wrong, using Testbench isnt nearly as simple as the readme makes it out to be...p  pETA got a little bit closer after sleeping on it. I realized codegetPackageProviderscode and codegetPackageAliasescode might need to look like what was in codeappconfigapp.phpcode so I modified the entries, using codeMyVendorMyPackageMyPackageServiceProvidercode and codeMyVendorMyPackageFacadesMyPackagecode respectively. Now Im getting an error within the test p  pcodeNonstatic method MyVendorMyPackageMyClassgetConfigValue should not be called statically, assuming this from incompatible context.codep  pWhich I think means the Facade portion isnt working, because that facade should take a nonstatic class method and make it available as if it were static, rightp

The code goes this wayp  precodepublic void execute      String query  select a, b, e from table1     ....     ResultSet rs  stmt.executeQueryquery     String query2  null     ListltIntegergt list1  ....     ListltIntegergt list2  ....     whilers.next              query2  select count as rowcount from vwview1 where f  rs.getStringa   and d  rs.getStringb          .....

Negative 121 pA long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, I used to write programs in Delphi, and then if I needed something to happen really fast, Id write those routines in handwritten assembler. It produced much faster code than the compiler did.p  pBut is this true strongin practicestrong any more Obviously handwritten assembler will always be at least as fast strongin principlestrong as compiled highlevel code. But CPUs have moved on a long way since those dark times. Now, if you were trying to optimize your assembler, youd have to take into account ordering of instructions so they could be pipelined or run concurrently, the effect of branch prediction, and a million other things and I suspect its impossible to hold them all in human RAM simultaneously.p  pSo does this mean that a decent but not superhuman programmer will these days produce faster code by writing C than by writing handwritten assembler, at least when coding for a modern CPUp  pOne other possibility that occurs to me. Does the optimization happen embeforeem the highlevel language is turned into assembler, or afterwards If its afterwards... might it be faster to produce handwritten assembler, and then put it through the compilers optimization processp  pThe question arose recently when I was writing some code for a programming challenge, where the essence of it was to produce a routine that should run as fast as possible on a Raspberry Pi. I would have been allowed to write it in assembler but my guess was that carefully written C would be faster, even though a Pi processor isnt that sophisticated in 2014 terms.p  pTo make the question more concrete and specificp  ul liSuppose youre wanting to write blazingly fast integer numbercrunching code to run on a Raspberry Pi. Youve written some very nice C code that runs as a tight loop to solve the problem. Is it worth handcrafting it in assembler to speed it up, or will that in practice give you something less efficientli ul

Negative 121 pIm working for an image processing project. Im using SURF algorithm and i have already read SURF official paper. I know that the dimension of the image doesnt change in the scalespace like in SIFT. Now, for example, if i use 3 octave and 2 levels for each octave, i will use these dimension of box filters 9x9, 15x15 first octave, 15x15,27x27 second octave, 27x27,51x51 third octave. My question is is the convolution between integral image and the box filter 15x15 of the first octave equal to the convolution between integral image and the box filter 15x15 of the second octave In my opinion the results are equal, but, maybe there are two differents variance values of box filters in the convolutions explained above. I didnt understand this part of the paper.p

Negative 121 pour users are loosing the JavaScript generated Links at some point while surfing our reports and i am out of ideas, please help..p  pWe are using reporting services within SQL Server 2014. Sharepoint 2013 with migrated contentdb from 2010 is handling user authentication and offers the startpage into the available moduls. We tested in all current versions of ie, ff, chrome and could reproduce the error in all of them.p  pThe problem looks like this A user starts with sharepoint startingpage and clicks the reportsstartpage for a certain modul, which opens inside a divlayer. From there all the following links are constructed with JavaScript and contain a contentID which keeps the user connected to his reportsession. After a while the user will suddenly loose this. JavaScript wont generate the link when a link is clicked, instead the user gets the hardcoded httpslink to the startpage. As if JavaScript crashes or the onclickevent is not being catched anymore.p  pThe behaviour is happening repeatedly but in no definitive way to produce this error has been found. sometimes you have to wait for two minutes between clicks sometimes it wont happen for hours and then it happens right after loading. p  pWe tried to repeat the same way through the reports over and over again and get different results. Since the SSRS JavaScript is build in into reporting services reprogramming the onclick event is no option.  Following the actions in chrome with the console shows no javascript errors along the way.p  pI am out of ideas what to test. If there is anyone with fresh ideas, please let me know.  Scanning forums for this kind of error i had no hits so far ...p  pThanx in advancep

However, I do not know how to make that csv cached, or even how to access the cache via PapaParse.p  pGoing further with this, how could I then check how long ago this csv file has been updated, and if it needs to be updated pull the csv off the server again I understand there is a lastModified property in Javascript but it is unclear whether or not that works for cached files.p

Negative 121 pI have the problem where I want to use Picasso for my ListView, as it has great bitmap caching, but currently have to simply use codeimageView.setImageBitmapbitmapcode.p  pI have a list of bitmaps strongwhich are not downloaded or stored as files, I simply have the Bitmap objects as they were originally from the users camera or phone storage but at this point the app has placed image effects on each of the bitmaps so that they are unique from the originalsstrong, for examplep  precodeArrayListltBitmapgt bitmapList  new ArrayListltgt codepre  pEach list item is simply an ImageView that displays one of these bitmaps. When trying to use Picasso for this, I realized I cant simply set an ImageView to a bitmap like the freedom of codeImageView.setImageBitmapcode allows me to do, but instead I need the image URI. From what Ive seen, the only way to get the URIs from these bitmaps is to store the images on the device first, then extract the URIs from these stored images. The issue with this is it takes a while in the app to save all of these images, then extracting the correct one for each list item is an issue in its own.p  pIs there any way to use Picasso for ImageViews with just having a bitmap, without saving the image to the device first, similarly to how codeImageView.setImageBitmapcode worksp
Negative 121 pI installed a plugin called a hrefhttpswordpress.orgpluginsadminguidedashboardwidget relnofollowAdmin Guide Dashboard Widgeta. The idea is that it adds a widget to the WordPress Control Panel the first screen that shows up upon login. On this widget you choose a blogpost category and then every post you write with that category shows up in that widget.p  pWell it didnt work at all. The widget showed all of my posts. I tried to change the category on the widget, but I just couldnt get it to work so I uninstalled it. Then I realized the thecontent of all my blog posts was gone. I tried to install the plugin again, I tried to change the category I had set for the plugin, nothing worked. I uninstalled. The content part of my posts is still not showing up at all.p  pBefore I installed that plugin I had only created one category, called Nyheder Now Im not sure if all of my posts were categorized as Nyheder or if they were simply uncategorized. I tried unchecking Nyheder from my posts but it gets checked again automatically. I dont know if my posts should be uncategorized if thats even possible or if the problem lies somewhere else.p  pThe news archive page of the website in question is a hrefhttpmalungos.dkcategorynyheder relnofollowherea.

Negative 121 pF supports a type constraint for unmanaged. This is not the same as a value type constraint like struct constraints.  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd233203.aspxMSDN notesa that the behavior of the unmanaged constraint isp  blockquote   pThe provided type must be an unmanaged type. Unmanaged types are either certain primitive types sbyte, byte, char, nativeint, unativeint, float32, float, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, or decimal, enumeration types, nativeptrlt, or a nongeneric structure whose fields are all unmanaged types.p blockquote  pThis is a very handy constraint type when doing platform invocation, and more than once I wish C had a way of doing this. C does not have this constraint. C does not support all constraints that emcanem be specified in CIL. An example of this is an enumeration. In C, you cannot do thisp  precodepublic void FooltTgtT bar where Tenum codepre  pHowever, the C compiler does honor the enum constraint if it comes across it in another library. Jon Skeet is able to use this to create his a hrefhttpscode.google.compunconstrainedmelodyUnconstrained Melodya project.p  pSo, my question is, is Fs unmanaged constraint something that can be represented in CIL, like an enum constraint and just not exposed in C, or is it enforced purely by the F compiler like some of the other constraints F supports like Explicit Member Constraintp

Negative 121 pi am currently looking for a fast way to realize an idea of mine for which i would need a number count for all functions called inside a binary executable, during runtime.  As far as i know Intels PIN tool can count routine calls and the number of instructions inside those routines See here a hrefhttpssoftware.intel.comsiteslandingpagepintooldocs67254Pinhtmlindex.htmlProcInstrCount relnofollowhttpssoftware.intel.comsiteslandingpagepintooldocs67254Pinhtmlindex.htmlProcInstrCounta. But what happens when the symbol table is not available Can PIN cope with thatp  pI do not need names for the routines, their starting addresses would suffice. Are there any tools out there which i could use to have access to such informationp  pA little background I want to cluster certain function calls during runtime. For example i want to cluster all periodic function calls inside a update cluster. Furthermore i want to be able to tell which functions are getting called as a result of an user action e.g. button press and then cluster those function again. In the end i want to have a rather clear image of which functions are getting executed when. Is this even possiblep  pThanks for any advicep

Negative 121 pI often end up in a situation where its very convenient to be using the codeStatecode monad, due to having a lot of related functions that need to operate on the same piece of data in a semiimperative way. p  pSome of the functions need to read the data in the State monad, but will never need to change it. Using the codeStatecode monad as usual in these functions works just fine, but I cant help but feel that Ive given up Haskells inherent safety and replicated a language where any function can mutate anything. p  pIs there some typelevel thing that I can do to ensure that these functions can only emreadem from the codeStatecode, and never write to itp  pCurrent situationp  precodeiWriteData  Int gt State MyState  iWriteData n  do      state lt get     put doSomething n state   Ideally this type would show that the state cant change. iReadData  State MyState Int iReadData  do      state lt get     return getPieceOf state  bigFunction  State MyState  bigFunction  do     iWriteData 5     iWriteData 10     num lt iReadData   How do we know that the state wasnt modified     iWRiteData num codepre  pIdeally codeiReadDatacode would probably have the type codeReader MyState Intcode, but then it doesnt play nicely with the codeStatecode.

Negative 121 pI have dropdown menu on a mobile page which is supposed to hide when you click anywhere outside of the menu. This works fine except for one textarea on the page, when its clicked on an Android phone. When I click on that textarea, the menu doesnt hide on the first click, but the onscreen keyboard does pop up. It only hides on the second click.p  pWhy isnt it hiding properly Theres a JavaScript event listener on the textarea specifically, which should hide it on the first click. Is the onscreen keyboard opening event interfering with thingsp

Negative 121 pIm having issues with one of our clients websites.  We recently increased the instance count from 1 to 2.  Now the site is much more responsive, but its behaving very strangely.  The website uses the Sitefinity CMS.  When a content update is made, it does not show up when others view it.  From what Ive read, adding an instance creates a load balanced environment.  Is that really whats happening  If so, how can I access each instance individually  I need to tell Sitefinity what addresses are part of the load balanced environment, from what I can tell.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 121 pI have a debugging problemp  ul liI have a WP8 and when I am loading a Sencha Touch Web App in IE10, it works.li liWhen I load the same app in my desktop IE11, set to emulate Mobile IE10 via F12 tools, it works as well.li liIt works in Chrome Desktop as well.li liIt works in Android 4.0.4 Browser as well.li ul  pWhen I make a PhoneGapCordova app from that app, I thought to have four choicesp  ul liInstall the apk on my Android 4.0.4 smart phone.  the app starts, but shows only the Headline no error in logcat, console.log output is normal.li liInstall the apk on an Android emulator  Android emulator crashes whether I start it standalone or by sending the apk.li liInstall the xap on WP8 phone.  The app does not proceed further than the Sencha Touch splashscreen codeconsole.logcode output seems to indicate that app.js is physically loaded but its code is not executed.li liInstall the xap in the emulator.  The app does not proceed further than the Sencha Touch splashscreen codeconsole.logcode output seems to indicate that the Sencha Touch microloader is only partly executed.li ul  pSo, in every of these four cases, behaviour is different. So I thought to include weinre debugger. it is installed on the dev server and can be reached from all LAN computers, so firewall issues can be ruled out completely.

Negative 121 pI built an android app that is called from the browser precisely from an input type file element, this app will record a sound and after recording the app should return and set the path of the recorded file to the caller input type file. My android app is launched successfully, and records the sounds, the file are stored in the external sd card, and of course I can play the recorded files, the problem I have is that the app never returns the path of the recorded file, it returns a path of a file with a name generated by timestamp and other code, with JPG extension, and with 0 bytes of length, not sure why JPG I dont use camera for anything. I know that this solution will work only in Chrome starting some versions of Android, I need a solution like this. Can you please help me why it is returning a JPG file of 0 bytes instead of the path of the recorded file with extension 3gp, tell me what Im doing wrong.

Negative 121 pI am using Fullcalendar with a backlog area where endusers can see and dragampdrop events inout from the calendar. The users can also filter by location, priority and responsible and more... the events he wants to see this update the backlog and the calendar.

Negative 121 pIm a strongPHP Developerstrong by profession. So, I dont have much knowledge about mobile apps, iOS, Android, etc. such like things. So, please try to understand me.p  pIve an app developed using iOS by the respective development team. Now, I have to provide this app the strongPushNotificationsstrong using strongPushwooshstrong.p  pIve understood what is mean by pushnotification and usage of strongPushwooshstrong for the same. Also, Im able to send sample pushnotification by using the appid and authkey I got from strongPushwoosh Control Panelstrong. When I run the corresponding PHP file from the server the Success Message with proper status code I receive.p  pMy query is about actually how to implement this pushnotifications service into the app from server side perspectivep  pNow for this lets consider the more dynamic and practical thing.p  pActually there is one table in MySQL database which contains the notifications. As soon as any new entry gets inserted into that table Ive to check whether itnotification is for loggedin user or not. If there isare any new notifications generated for logged in user Ive to send the pushnotification to the concerned user to hisher respective device through strongPushwooshstrong.p  pNow my question is should the PHP file which contains the code for checking the new notifications and sending it as a pushnotifications be called from the app side or is there any other way aroundp  pIn other words my doubt is should this check for new notifications should be performed only upon a request coming from appp  pI discussed the same issue with the mobile app development team, they told me we dont send you any kind of request you simply have to send us the pushnotification. They told me the meaning of pushnotification is only the same that app never send any request to the server, the server itself should send the notification to the app whenever available. p  pThen in this case how should the PHP file that contains the code should get execute since there is no request received for itp  pAnother question here is if the app is not going to send any request to the PHP file then how should I know which user is logged in and requesting for the new notifications generated for himher, if anyp  pSuppose, if the request has come for the PHP file then should I need to make token based authentication in PHP code for that particular user or it will be done on app side and only upon validating the user successfully they will send the request to PHP file p  pAlso the check for new notifications should be make for every two minutes intervalpolling. From where this check should be made I mean will the PHP file receive request from app for every two minutes or whatp  pPlease help me resolving these tedious issues.p  pThanks.p  pFollowing is my sample code The Auth Token and App ID have been changed for security purposep  precodeltphp   definePWAUTH, XXXXXXXXXXX   definePWAPPLICATION, XXXXXXXXXXX   definePWDEBUG, true    function pwCallmethod, data      url  httpscp.pushwoosh.comjson1.3 . method     request  jsonencode[request gt data]      ch  curliniturl     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER, true     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTENCODING, gzip, deflate     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHEADER, true     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOST, true     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS, request      response  curlexecch     info  curlgetinfoch     curlclosech      if definedPWDEBUG ampamp PWDEBUG        print [PW] request requestn       print [PW] response responsen       print [PW] info  . printrinfo, true            pwCallcreateMessage, array     application gt PWAPPLICATION,     auth gt PWAUTH,     notifications gt array             array                 senddate gt now,                 content gt test,                 data gt arraycustom gt json data,                 link gt httppushwoosh.com                                 gt codepre  pIn the above code only Im going to integrate code for checking and sending new notifications if available.  p

Basically, the idea I am trying to code is that given two cameras that can simulate a multiple baseline stereo system I am trying to estimate the pose of one camera given the other.p  pLooking at the same scene, I would incorporate some noise in the pose of the second camera, and given the clean image from camera 1, and slightly distortedskewed image from camera 2, I would like to estimate the pose of camera 2 from this data as well as the known baseline between the cameras. I have been reading up about homography matrices and related implementation in opencv, but I am just trying to get some suggestions about possible approaches. Most of the applications of the homography matrix that I have seen talk about stitching or overlaying images, but here I am looking for a six degrees of freedom attitude of the camera from that.p  pItd be great if someone can shed some light on these questions too Can an approach used for this be extended to more than two cameras And is it also possible for both the cameras to have some noise in their pose, and yet recover the 6dof attitude at every instantp

Negative 121 pI was wondering whether I could gain any significant performance difference in my Angular app specifically view processing if I change codengappcode and codengcontrollercode attribute placement from i.e. codebodycode to some innerpage block element with much smaller DOM subtreep  pSuppose I have a very long page with huge amount of content, but only part of it is Angular powered. Everything else is either server generated which means its somewhat static from the clientside PoV.p  pWould it be better to put codengappngcontrollercode on only that subnode where Angular actually executes or would it be the same if I put them on codebodycode element of this very long pagep  pstrongDoes Angular process the view only of the subDOM where codengappngcontrollercode are defined or does it process the whole DOM anywaystrongp  pIs there any proof about this or even Angular documentationp

Negative 121 pI have a SSRS project in which multiple reports are using the same stored procedure. All reports are different obviously but the data source is same. p  pFor example one report is a larger tabular transaction report with 50 fields and 20 parameters, one report is a one parameter and one page report essentially just showing one record in a detailed view. There are few other reports which are very similar to the first tabular report but most of the parameters are defaulted and hidden and they use different fields from the stored procedure. p  pAll of these reports are using same stored procedure say codespTransactioncode which has 20 parameters and returns 100 fields. The way the arguments are handled in the stored procedure is something like thisp  precode               tblTransaction.TransactionID  TransactionId          OR              TransactionId IS NULL         AND                      DateCreatedDaysRelative IS NULL             OR             CASTtblTransaction.Created AS DATE  CASTDATEADDDAY, DateCreatedDaysRelative, GETDATE  AS DATE                  AND                                       DateStartMonthsRelative IS NULL                 AND DateEndMonthsRelative IS NULL                          OR                               tblTransaction.DateStart lt DATEADDMONTH, DateStartMonthsRelative, GETDATE                  AND  tblTransaction.DateEnd gt DATEADDMONTH, DateEndMonthsRelative, GETDATE                                AND      tblTransaction.Receipt  ReceiptRequired     OR ReceiptRequired IS NULL  AND      PubID  dbo.tblJournal.PubID     OR PubID IS NULL  codepre  pI understand its easy to maintain having one code for all report but its a big stored procedure which takes a lot of arguments and returns a lot of fields and non of the report that uses it actually uses all its arguments or fields. p  pSo my question is is it a good practice to have one common big piece of code where half the inputs and outputs are not in use at a time by one report or creating separate stored procedures for each report with only required input and outputs or something else like one stored procedure but with dynamic sqlp

Negative 121 pSo, Im sure this must have been asked before but I cant seem to find anything. The thing is that when Im programming search features for web apps, it never feels quite right to me.p  pIm using Ruby on Rails, but I guess this is a question that applies to any situation in which you are using a RESTful MVC pattern.p  pLets say you have a strongResourcestrong e.g. Users, ToDos,  you want to search through. As soon as the app grows this wont be feasible with simple LIKEqueries anymore and you start using an index e.g. Solr, ElasticSearch, Lucene, . The indexed resource also tends to be compound data from the Resource and its associated objects a Users location, the ToDos creator, .p  pHow do we best represent thisp  ul liIs it a GET to resources strongResourcestrongindex It is a selective list of the main resource, but then again its actually this compound thing and if the search functionality is extensive it really tends to bloat up the Models code.li liIs it a POST to searches strongSearchstrongcreate We are creating a search but are not saving it. Instead it kind of gets transformed into a set of SearchResults.li liSo, is it a GET to a SearchResult strongSearchResultstrongshow But it doesnt have an ID. I guess the SearchIndex is kind of the database for that model, but you wouldnt really create a SearchResult, right Its more of a Searchcreate that ends in a SearchResultshow but that also feels wonky to me.li ul
Negative 121 pIm just learning about flexbox, and Im trying to understand how it works. I have to build a dashboard that has the width and height of the viewport  no scrollbar , a fixed height header, a fixed height footer, and an auto complete height content.

Negative 121 pIve seen a few questions similar to this, but not hitting the exact same problem that I have seen.p  pI already know how to make grids more or less work inside a tab pane. However, they dont seem to be working as I expect. What I expect is to see is a set of tabs, each using their own personal space to display gridcontained data. What I see, instead, is sets of tabs with data that is attempting to share the same grid space, and therefore the rows of data are stacking so that they are pushed down the page. The entire tab area will be twice as high as necessary, with the data on Tab2 being located on the bottom half of the tab pane, while the top half is empty or would be holding data from Tab1.p  pExamplep  precodeltdiv classcontainergt   ltdiv classpanel paneldefaultgt     ltdiv classpanelbodygt        ltul classnav navtabsgt         ltli classactivegtlta datatoggletab hreftab1gtTab1ltagtltligt         ltligtlta datatoggletab hreftab2gtTab2ltagtltligt       ltulgt        ltdiv idtabcontentgt         ltdiv idtab1 classtabpane fade in activegt           ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolsm6gt              ...tab1, col1 information...             ltdivgt             ltdiv classcolsm6gt              ...tab1, col2 information...             ltdivgt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv idtab2 classtabpane fade in activegt           ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolsm6gt              ...tab2, col1 information...             ltdivgt             ltdiv classcolsm6gt              ...tab2, col2 information...             ltdivgt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt      ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pWhat Im trying to figure out is if Im coding something wrong or if Bootstrap simply does not support what Im trying to accomplish. I have already tested the idea of removing the .row divs, with no success. The data stacks unevenly, rather than staying in separate rows. It appears as if .col classes are unable to share the same space, even while hidden.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 121 pI have worked in a lot of shops where they ran a Database First Model so Lookup Tables were always required. Your lookup table had to match your Enums so that you kept database integrity. I 100 agree with this idea, but have found that when it comes to the Code First Model, this is not available out of the box. I did read somewhere that the EF Team may be adding the ability to dynamically have Enums added to your DB via migrations in EF7 but they warned that its not a promise.p  pSo how do you if at all accomplish this I am going to provide my solution below in an answer and look forward to your feedback.p  pI am using EF 6.1.3 and .NET 4.5.1p

Negative 121 pI use three different web service methods to insert data into three different tables. At first I am calling method1 to insert data into table1. Method1 returns primary key of table1. Then I pass primary key of table to method2 and method3. Both methods insert data into table2 and table3 correspondingly. Suppose if an exception occurs while inserting data into table3 I want to rollback data inserted in table1 and table2. I call the web service methods one after the another. I am using asmx webservices. I searched a lot to find solution but all I managed to find is rollback example in single method call. Is it possible to do sql transactions across c web services. Please help me to fix this issue. Thanks in advancep

Negative 121 pSaluton Mundo, Ive been working on this function that prints the lettering on a check based upon the numbers.

Negative 121 pIm using a web service to transfer files from ftp to dropbox. I want to update the version in dropbox every week. Right now I have to go into the service and manually click the transfer now button every week.p  pId like to create a cron job or other automated solution that runs every week, logs into the service and clicks on a set of buttons with an interval of 60s between each button to give the service enough time to start the action.p  pThe buttons are nothing but a div with an id and an actual click on it triggers a JS listener.p  pThe way I was going to approach this was to write a cURL script in php that loads the page and then tries to do the action that occurs when the button is pressed i.e. triggers the listener. Its not easy though and before I spend too much time on it, Id like to know if anyone can think of a simpler approachp  pThe basic structure of the process should bep  ul liRuns automatically every week e.g. on a LAMP server or using a web serviceli liLogs into service simple form triggering a POST requestli liClicks on all the buttons with class buttonNow and waits x amount of seconds between the clicksli liIdeally it would send some kind of confirmation once the task has been completedli ul

Negative 121 pI am trying to add a feature that lets data not be saved if an application setting is set to not save. I have many DataManagers that act as a data access layer in my application. My plan was to create 2 custom attributes code[DataRetentionPolicyNameHere]code and code[InspectDataRetention]code that should be applied to methods on my data managers and, when present, the application should check if the RetentionSetting property on my code[DataRetention]code is set to DoNotSave, and if so, ignore. For examplep  precodepublic class User        public string Name get set       [DataRetentionPII]      public long SSN get set   public class UserManager        public User GetUserint userId       [InspectDataRetention]      public void UpdateUserUser user       public void DeleteUser user   codepre  pIn the above example, when UpdateUser is called on the UserManager, the application would first inspect the object and search for any [DataRetention] attributes. It would then grab the RetentionSetting property of the attribute because the constructor for the attribute would set the retention setting and if it is set to DoNotSave, then it would reset that field to its default value in this case 0. However, if the User class were modified like belowp  precode[DataRetentionPII] public class User                 public string Name get set      public long SSN get set       codepre  pThen, when DoNotSave is configured, UpdateUser should simply return null not perform the update method.p  pIs this possible with a custom attribute If not, outside of an interceptor with a specific interface i.e. RetainableDataManager  IDataManager and have all of my data managers implement the same IDataManager interface is there any way to accomplish this behavior.p  ul liMVC4 applicationli liData Managers are POCOsli liService layer in front of Data Layer made of POCOs alsoli ul

I have a 7stage slider that has the font sizes, and you can simply slide it to determine what size of font you want  that is the value I want saved throughout the app. But whenever I press back on the navigation bar and open the settings page again, the default size is always 22.p  p.hp  precodeinterface SettingsViewController  UIViewController  property strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UISlider sizeSlider property strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UILabel sampleText  end codepre  p.mp  precodeinterface SettingsViewController       NSArray numbers     NSMutableAttributedString sampleTextString     int fontSize     NSUserDefaults defaults   end  implementation SettingsViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.navigationItem.title  Settings      numbers  [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]                  Text Sizes, these number values represent each slider position     NSInteger numberOfSteps  float[numbers count]1                            Slider values go from 0 to the number of values in your numbers array      self.sizeSlider.maximumValue  numberOfSteps                                    As the slider moves it will continously call the valueChanged     self.sizeSlider.minimumValue  0       defaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]                                Setting the font to be the current font saved in the system     long textsize  [defaults integerForKeyfontSize]     NSLogtextsize ld, textsize     self.sizeSlider.value  textsize                                                Set the Slider to whatever font you had set it previously        self.sizeSlider.continuous  YES                                                NO makes it call only once you let go     [self.sizeSlider addTargetself actionselectorvalueChanged forControlEventsUIControlEventValueChanged]      sampleTextString  [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithStringThe Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog]     self.sampleText.attributedText  sampleTextString      [sampleTextString addAttributeNSFontAttributeName value[UIFont systemFontOfSizetextsize] rangeNSMakeRange0, sampleTextString.length]     voidvalueChangedUISlider sender     NSUInteger index  NSUIntegerself.sizeSlider.value  0.5        round the slider position to the nearest index of the numbers array     [self.sizeSlider setValueindex animatedNO]       NSNumber number  numbers[index]                                   lt This numeric value you want     [sampleTextString addAttributeNSFontAttributeName value[UIFont systemFontOfSize[number floatValue]] rangeNSMakeRange0, sampleTextString.length]      [defaults setInteger[number integerValue] forKeyfontSize]          Saving fontSize to NSUserDefaults     [defaults synchronize]      self.sampleText.attributedText  sampleTextString  end codepre

Negative 121 pI am trying to generate a text file of distinct 5card poker hands, very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26575312generatealldistinct7cardcombinationsofapokerhandthis questiona which I actually posted an answer to.  The program I pieced together from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma38327811732236this answer to that questiona mostly works.  However, there are two major problems  The number of hands is incorrect, and every hand has the 2 of Hearts in it.  Perhaps if the number of hands was correct, the hands would be correct as well.p  pThe person that posted the answer I was working from stated that he got the correct number by not seeding the initial card.  However, if you remove the seed you get an Invalid Exception error when it tries to do the ranking down the line.  Seeding it makes the program work, but returns only half of the hands.p  pWhat do I need to do to this code to get all distinct 5 card poker handsp  precodeusing System using
