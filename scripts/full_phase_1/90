Positive 90 pI have access to a scanner at my library which can create searchable PDFs.  These are PDFs that show the exact image of a scanned document, but there is a kind of hidden text in the PDF that can be selected when you try to select a portion of the image that contains text.  In this way you can copy and paste text or search for text in the scanned document.  This is VERY useful.  Its an awesome improvement over raw scanned images.  I also have several apps on my mac that can create this kind of searchable PDF from a scanned document or a raw image.p  pNow its obvious from any who has ever used OCR that the process of converting images to text is not 100 accurate, so the text that you search or copy will not be correct in some places.p  pSo I search for quite some time to find an application that would load a searchable PDF and allow me to repair the hidden searchable text without reformatting or modifying the original scanned image.p  pDoes anyone know of a tool or library API that would allow thisp  pIts worth saying here that I tried the latest version of Adobe Acrobat DC for Mac, and it doesnt seem to even allow me to emviewem the hidden searchable text, much less edit it.  It does allow me to replace scanned image with the results of its own OCR process so that I could edit and save the document.  But this would produce horrible results for any of the scanned documents that I am using.  It seems designed for editing a native PDF not editing a scanned document.p  pI have also tried ABBYY FineReader with no luck.p

Positive 90 pI have been following the Chapter 8 Filling out interactive forms iText example code and pdfs at a hrefhttpitextpdf.comexamplesiia.phpid154 relnofollowhttpitextpdf.comexamplesiia.phpid154a and have noticed a number of appearancerelated issues which also manifest themselves in the example pdfs.p  pThe example features a list of radio buttons classic dot within a circle and a list of checkboxes crossed box with a red background. So far so good. However the pdf generated after programmatically filling in these fields is visually inconsistent. The radio buttons have all reverted to squares and the selected Spanish has a wingdings  cross within it rather than a dot. The fields are all still editable. When I select a different radio button, the previously selected radio button reverts to an empty circle. The newly selected field has changed from an empty square to a dotted circle. This can also be observed with the checkboxes.p  pIs there any way to fill the fields whilst preserving their original appearancesp  pThanksp

Negative 90 pI am developing a web application using Struts 2.1.2 and Hibernate 3.2.6.GA. I have an entity, codeUsercode, which I have mapped to a table codeUSERScode in the DB using Hibernate. I want to have an image associated with this entity, which I plan to store as a codeBLOBcode in the DB. I also want to display the image on a webpage along with other attributes of the codeUsercode.p  pThe solution I could think of was to have a table codeIMAGESID, IMAGEcode where codeIMAGEcode is a codeBLOBcode column. codeUSERScode will have an codeFKcode column called codeIMAGEIDcode, which points to the codeIMAGEScode table. I will then map a property on codeUsercode entity, called codeimageIdcode mapped to this codeIMAGEIDcode as a Long. When rendering the page with a JSP, I would add images as codeltimg srcimages.actionid1gtcode etc, and have an Action which reads the image and streams the content to the browser, with the headers set to cache the image for a long time.p  pWill this work Is there a better approach for rendering images stored in a DB Is storing such images in the DB the right approach in the first placep

Negative 90 pWhere I work, we do a very large number very small ASP.NET apps, and it has happened a few times that sites have been deployed in precompiled format, and the app needs to be changed, but the version of the code available in source control is out of date and the developer is not available. The apps dll has to be decompiled and hacked back together. p  pIdeally, it would never happen that a develpoer rushes a change through testing and production and skips checking in the change, we have since made changes to our policies to keep this from happening, but I wonder if the overhead of compiling a site on the server whenever the app pool restarts is a big enough problem that we should avoid uploading our code directly to the server. It would be easier to check the version in source control vs the actual live version if we could download the live source. p  pWhat are the advantages of precompiling VS uploading cs files directly to the server and having them compiled therep

Negative 90 pIm creating a IE browser plugin that needs to be kept updated about what text has been selected by the user, or if no text is currently selected at all.  I learned how to get the selected text by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions217353retrievingselectedtextfromwebbrowsercontrolinnetc217509217509reading herea.  This is my code for doing sop  pre var doc  browser.Document as IHTMLDocument2 var selection  doc.selection as IHTMLSelectionObject var range  selection.createRange as IHTMLTxtRange string selectedText  range.text pre  pHowever, I am having difficulty determining the event handlers from which to access range.text to update my plugin.  Using the selectionchange event alone does not work in all cases.  When the user deselects the text by clicking directly on the selection, as opposed to clicking on a different part of the webpage, range.text still contains the old nonnull value when selectionchange is raised.  A workaround is to also listen for click events.  A click event is raised immediately after selectionchange, but at which point range.text is finally null.  However, Ive encountered a further problem for which I havent found a solution.  That is, if a user doubleclicks on a word, thus selecting it, the selectionchange event isnt raised at all.  Plus, when the click event or mousedown event or selectstart event is raised, range.text is still nullp  pHow can I solve this latter problem  Or is there an overall better approach I can takep

Negative 90 pIm just curious if the community considers it acceptable to use the term Code Freeze for situations where we stop development except for testing and fixing bugs.p  pstrongDevelopment Situationstrongp  pWere just finishing up our third and final sprint, which will be followed by a Code freeze and 2 weeks of QA testing.  It is a big release and some components development have transcended all 3 sprints.  Historically even though we call it a Code Freeze we still commit code to fix bugs.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pEvery release I try and correct my manager and coworkers that we should be calling it a Feature Freeze, because its pretty obvious that were going to find bugs and commit code to fix them as soon as we start heavy testing.  But they still persist in calling it a Code Freeze.  Sometimes we still have known bugs and declare a Code Freeze.p  pThe Wikipedia definition seems to agree with me a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFreeze5F28software5Fengineering29hereap  pstrongAnalysisstrongp  pI suspect that calling these situations a Code Freeze is some sort of willful a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDoublethinkDouble Thinka to provide false confidence to stake holders.  Or we are pretending to be in a Code Freeze situation because according to Scrum after every sprint we should have a shippable piece of software and it is the expectation we are following Scrum.  So we must call it what Scrum expects instead of what it really is.p  pstrongConclusionstrongp  pAm I over analyzing this  I just find it to be unhealthy to ignoring realities of situations and should either give it up calling it something its not or fix the root problem.

I dont want two separate rooms i.e. codeBedRoomcode and codeStudyRoomcode, but instead a single room codeMasterRoomcode which has both these facilities.  For the sake of code reusability, I could think of the following design optionsp  precodeOption1 HouseB ISA House HouseB HAS MasterRoom MasterRoom ISA Room codepre  pHere I lose the ability to reuse the attributes of codeBedRoomcode and codeStudyRoomcode that I created for codeHouseAcode. Note that most of the attributes of codeBedRoomcode and codeStudyRoomcode need to be reimplemented in codeMasterRoomcode anyway, thereby resulting in code duplication.p  precodeOption2 HouseB ISA House HouseB HAS MasterRoom MasterRoom ISA Room MasterRoom HAS LogicalBedroom MasterRoom HAS LogicalStudyRoom LogicalBedroom ISA BedRoom LogicalStudyRoom ISA StudyRoom codepre  pThis way, I use composition so that I could reuse most of my code I have several thousand lines of code that I could reuse, but the problem is that codeBedRoomcode is a concrete class and codelogicalBedRoomcode may find certain attributes not suitable and may be forced to override  methods so that they do nothing.  For example, codeBedroomgtnoOfSides  4code and codelogicalBedRoomgtnoOfSides  code. Is this a good use of inheritancep  pMy actual design is for a complex chip that combines the functionality of two individual chips I used House motherboard and Room chip analogy. I code in Object Oriented Perl and I would really appreciate any alternate design suggestions.p  pThanksp

Negative 90 pI am working on an opensource project, and part of it is licensed under a permissive license written by the original developer. The license is very short and not very detailed. Moreover, it doesnt appear to be compatible with the license the rest of the project uses.p  pI would like to ask the original developer to relicense the code under a different, opensource license. The problem is, I dont know what they need to do in order to achieve this. For example, I know that GPL usage guide states that each file needs to have a certain header, referencing the license. Presumably other licenses say, BSD are activated similarly.p  pThe source code is already in an SCM. Do I need to ask the person to modify every single file by himself, or can I somehow make it less work for himp  pemIn case you wonder why I want to avoid asking the person to commit the changes  its because there is actually quite a bit of work. The project is Windowsonly, and the SCM, Mercurial on BitBucket, requires SSH. Getting this to work on Windows by someone with no prior experience  even if they are a good developer  is anything but trivial.emp

Negative 90 pIve been considering using Haskells Parsec parsing library to parse a subset of Java as a recursive descent parser as an alternative to more traditional parsergenerator solutions like Happy. Parsec seems very easy to use, and parse speed is definitely not a factor for me. Im wondering, though, if its possible to implement backup with Parsec, a technique which finds the correct production to use by trying each one in turn. For a simple example, consider the very start of the JLS Java grammarp  precodeLiteral     IntegerLiteral       FloatingPointLiteral codepre  pId like a way to not have to figure out how I should order these two rules to get the parse to succeed. As it stands, a naive implementation like thisp  precodeliteral  do      x lt try do  v lt integer return IntLiteral v ltgt          do  v lt float return FPLiteral v     returnLiteral x  codepre  pWill not work... inputs like 15.2 will cause the integer parser to succeed first, and then the whole thing will choke on the . symbol. In this case, of course, its obvious that you can solve the problem by reordering the two productions. In the general case, though, finding things like this is going to be a nightmare, and its very likely that Ill miss some cases. Ideally, Id like a way to have Parsec figure out stuff like this for me. Is this possible, or am I simply trying to do too much with the library The Parsec documentation claims that it can parse contextsensitive, infinite lookahead grammars, so it seems like something like I should be able to do something here.p

Negative 90 pIm developing in LAMP LinuxApacheMySQLPHP since I remember myself. But one question was bugging me for years now. I hope you can help me to find an answer and point me into the right direction. Here is my challengep  pSay, we are creating a community website, where we allow our users to register. The MySQL table where we store all users would look then like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE users    uid int2 unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement COMMENT User ID,   name varchar20 NOT NULL,   password varchar32 NOT NULL COMMENT Password is saved as a 32bytes hash, never in plain text,   email varchar64 NOT NULL,   created int11 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT Timestamp of registration,   updated int11 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT Timestamp of profile update, e.g. change of email,   PRIMARY KEY  uid  ENGINEMyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  pSo, from this snippet you can see that we have a unique and automatically incrementing for every new user uid field. As on every good and loyal community website we need to provide users with possibility to completely delete their profile if they want to cancel their participation in our community.p  pHere comes my problem. Lets say we have 3 registered users Alice uid  1, Bob uid  2 and Chris uid  3. Now Bob want to delete his profile and stop using our community. If we delete Bobs profile from the users table then his missing uid will create a gap which will be never filled again. In my opinion its a huge waste of uids. I see 3 possible solutions herep  p1 Increase the capacity of the uid field in our table from SMALLINT int2 to, for example, BIGINT int8 and ignore the fact that some of the uids will be wasted.p  p2 introduce the new field isdeleted, which will be used to mark deleted profiles but keep them in the table, instead of deleting them to reutilize their uids for newly registered users. The table will look then like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE users    uid int2 unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement COMMENT User ID,   name varchar20 NOT NULL,   password varchar32 NOT NULL COMMENT Password is saved as a 32bytes hash, never in plain text,   email varchar64 NOT NULL,   isdeleted int1 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT If equal to 1 then the profile has been deleted and will be reused for new registrations,   created int11 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT Timestamp of registration,   updated int11 unsigned NOT NULL default 0 COMMENT Timestamp of profile update, e.g. change of email,   PRIMARY KEY  uid  ENGINEMyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  p3 Write a script to shift all following user records once a previous record has been deleted. E.g. in our case when Bob uid  2 decides to remove his profile, we would replace his record with the record of Chris uid  3, so that uid of Chris becomes qual to 2 and mark isdeleted  1 the old record of Chris as vacant for the new users. In this case we keep the chronological order of uids according to the registration time, so that the older users have lower uids.p  pPlease, advice me now which way is the right way to handle the gaps in the autoincrement fields. This is just one example with users, but such cases occur very often in my programming experience.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 90 pBasically Im looking for the best way to remove the need to hard code any actual URLs within views when two different URLs call the same controller action.  As shown below, two routes define different URLs, one for creating a new customer, whilst the other is for editing an existing customer.  Inside the controller action it determines what to do by checking the value of AccountNumber  if it was not provided null then it knows that it is creating a new customer.p  precoderoutes.MapRoute     CustomerEdit,     CustomerEditCustNum,     new  controller  Customer, action  Edit, AccountNumber  CustNum    routes.MapRoute     CustomerCreate,     CustomerCreate,     new  controller  Customer, action  Edit   codepre  pThe downside to this approach is that you cant use codeUrl.Action...code in the views to determine the URL because there are two different URLs mapping to the controller action. I had hoped that the call to codeUrl.Action...code would determine which to use by the RouteValues provided, but it just appears to use the 1st matching route defined.  So in this case if you callp  pcodeUrl.ActionEdit, Customer, new  CustNum  2 codep  pyou get  CustomerEdit2 as youd expect, but if you callp  pcodeUrl.ActionEdit, Customercodep  pthe view outputs the URL CustomerEditCustNum.  p  pIs there anyway using this configuration that you would not need to hard code URLs into the view  Or is it considered better practise to have a separate action for creating new customers and another action for editing customers, so you end up with the followingp  precodepublic class CustomerController  Controller       public ActionResult Create       return CreateOrEditnull        public ActionResult Editint custNum       return CreateOrEditcustNum        private ActionResult CreateOrEditint custNum      ....  codepre

Negative 90 pIf i take a web application which is subject to GNUGPL license and modify it inhouse and then use it as a subscription fee business model, for eg. user pays for service and web content and not for the software itself, thus i am not distributing the software itself, is my custom version of the software be subject to the GNUGPL terms of redistributing the source and the same terms or notp  pTo give more indepth to the issue, lets take for eg. a web game licensed under GNUGPL. If i take it and modify it and add content and custom gameplay  and such to it and then host the game with a subscription fee or free but with ingame purchase model. In this case the user will pay for the service itself of using the online serviceserver and gameplaycontent. Will my custom game infringe the GNUGPL license model of the original source and be required to release the modified source under the same termsp  pAs for the subscription based business model for charging for services and not for the software itself, i know that it is not infringing the GNUGPL model, thus totally possible, unless someone contradicts me Thus i am more interested in source code releasing part of the issue.p

Negative 90 pWeve started using TFS2010 over at the company I work at. We create ecommerce web applications shopping sites.

Ive looked at the web deploy tool, but MSDN seems to indicate that it can only do initial deployments, and I need to be able to do incremental deployments with the same script.p  pIm thinking of using the invokeActivity activity in the template to use powershell to do the job by specifying an FTP script which automatically copies the output of a build to a designated FTP site and then runs the SQL upgrade scripts, if needed by using SSH or s powershell remoting interactive session. possibly specified in a separate SQL scriptp  pThere is some unknown for me which I cant get clear through the use of googlep  pWhen queuing a build, will I be able to let the user specify a script present in source control  e.g. codesourcescriptsftpscript.ps1code  as the script which is to be used Will powershell be able to accessuse that file or should I copy it to the build directory and specify when I run it I dont know how to set up the template to get files from source control, so a pointer to some helpful info how to do that would be very much appreciatedp  pIf the previous just doesnt work at all, could I create a folder scripts in my website project, commit that to source control and then use codeBuildDetail.DropLocationRoot amp scriptscode as the location for the script and fore a copy of the script files by enabling the force copy optionp
Negative 90 pMaybe someone can explain this behavior.  Sometimes I will do an SVN update, and for some reason SVN will forget that a file is under source control, and it will delete it from my directory I have to codeRevertcode to add the files back.p  pJust now I made a change in a file and went to commit it.  The change was codeDeletedcode instead, which I quickly realized after pressing the Commit button.  Checking the folder, I found that strongnonestrong of the files under there were under version control anymore SVN had somehow forgotten without running an update at all before now that they had been added to it at all, and had I committed the entire directory it would have deleted emeverythingem.  Again, I had to revert the folder, readd the file I changed, and recommit my change with a note that the previous commit incorrectly deleted the file.p  pAny idea why this happens  I also frequently run into Your tmp directory is corrupt.  Run cleanup errors nearly every time I try to update my working copy I basically have to run Cleanup emevery timeem before I run an Update.p  pI did not set up the SVN system here at work, and I have no idea how its configured.  I have not encountered this kind of flakiness with SVN at any job previously that was using it.p  pEDIT  I am using VisualSVN 1.7.11 and occasionally TortoiseSVN, on Windows XP.

Negative 90 pI have a ASP.NET MVC application that uses Spring.NET 1.2 for dependecy injection and NHibernate 2.1 for ORM. It has been running on MVC 3, using Sarp Architecture in a slightly modified version which we have been compiling ourselves, something I am now striving to get rid of. I.e. I am going to start using referenced SharpArch .dlls instead of pure source code. p  pThe initialization of Spring is done using tips taken from a hrefhttpblog.alexkyprianou.com20110307usingspringnetwithmvc3 relnofollowherea, as well as using the SpringServiceLocatorAdapter found a hrefhttpcode.google.compunhaddinssourcebrowseuNhAddInsuNhAddIns.SpringAdapters.TestsSpringServiceLocatorAdapter.csrbf38e11934cbfb402065f3191f5f8d5147895da2 relnofollowherea. NH is initialized using SharpArchs NHibernateSession.Init, which is given our two assemblypaths. The mapping is done with HBM XML files.p  pThe decision to move to NH 3 led to a serious case of DLL Hell, due to which I of course had to update FluentNH, NH Validator, SharpArch, Spring, and Castle Windsor binaries. To get things working a lot of manual labor was needed, changing references and doing minor code fixes. This was all expected.p  pNow Ive got the software running well enough that Spring is initialized and the DI done correctly. But when a repository tries using its Session object, I get the following error. p  blockquote   pError creating object with name     no services of type   SharpArch.NHibernate.ISessionFactoryKeyProvider   definedp blockquote  pIve been trying to figure out the cause of this for the best part of a day now.  It seems to me like SpringServiceLocatorAdapter is obsolete, but I can find no information regarding that. Also, simply removing the use of it results in repositories Sessions being null and thus NullReferenceExceptions. But as far as I know the problem could just as well be the way NH is initialized.p  pHopefully someone can point me in the right direction. Im having a hard time since Im not the one who setup the system to begin with, and lists of breaking changes for the version upgrades are hard to find. p  pThanks a lot I will of course provide more information if needed.p

Negative 90 pI have two functions that I need to run, both take quite some time to complete.  The second is dependent on the first, so they need to be in order.  The first MUST be done with an ajax call to Python from JavaScript using jquery.ajax.  The second is some parsing and HTML generation, so it can be done in either JavaScript or Python.p  pI would prefer the second to be in Python since this would mean the heavy lifting is done serverside.  However, I would like to notify the user that the first function is complete and the second one is running.  The problem is the amount of data between the functions would not make sense to transfer from Python to JavaScript server to client, then back to Python client to server.  Itd be much faster to keep everything on the server side until the second function is complete, then transfer what information I do have back to JavaScript containing the HTML code.p  pAgain, I would like to notify the user through JavaScript that the first Python function is complete and the second one is running.  Then once the second one completes, the data should be passed back to JavaScript to be displayed.p

So you think it will perform the best without manual gc Further from a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbooksperformance1steditionhtmlJPAppGC.fm.html relnofollowhttpjava.sun.comdocsbooksperformance1steditionhtmlJPAppGC.fm.htmla, it says that only once the method is taken of the stack, only then in this case it would be available for garbage collection. And i tried with finalize by having a print, not the right way, but should atleast work once for 100000 objects, there is absolutely no gc.p  pPaolo Thanks. What i am trying to implement is a pipelining model, where every thread has a meassage queue, basically a framework where any thread can post a runnable to the other thread if it has some work with the thread, and the other thread will execute them after soem timewhen it is idle Ans when i meant, overload when the method comes out of the stack, what i mean is that garbage colelction will eventually happen, if it happens later, then clearing 40,000 elements will take a lot timep  p Joachim Sauer  System.gc can collect invisible objects, It is just that garbage collector doesnt collect them automatically. But when forced, it does as per a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbooksperformance1steditionhtmlJPAppGC.fm.html relnofollowhttpjava.sun.comdocsbooksperformance1steditionhtmlJPAppGC.fm.htmlap
Negative 90 pI have a simple method that sets the text of a labelp  precodepublic void setStatusfinal String status     statusLabel.setTextstatus  codepre  pbut when I call it before any sort of Display.asyncExecRunnable, it seems to not execute until after that Runnable has completed.

Negative 90 pIm testing out Eziriz strong.NET Reactorstrong to protect a software, developed using Visual Studio 2010 C WPF. p  pI am confused when the .NET Reactor ask to which assembly to protect. I though it supposed to protect the .msi file where user will be installing. But it asks me to upload an assembly file  which is an .exe.  So I upload the .exe in my binDebug folder which is generated by building the solution in Visual Studio. p  pAfter running the protection on .NET Reactor, I open the same .exe file with .NET Reflector, and I can still see all the classes and methods. Nothing is being protected at all.p  pI have read through the documentation  is it just not working or am I doing something wrongp

The way to tell if the employee has been transfered is if in the EmployeeDepartmentHistory table, the employee id has been in more than one record i.e. employeeID 1 is in both record 1 and record 2 because the person has been in two departments. How would I go about this Heres what I have as of nowp  precodeSELECT EmployeeDepartmentHistory.EmployeeID,Person.Contact.FirstName, Person.Contact.LastName, Department.Name From   HumanResources.Department INNER JOIN           HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory ON         HumanResources.Department.DepartmentID         HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory.DepartmentID INNER JOIN        HumanResources.Employee ON HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory.EmployeeID         HumanResources.Employee.EmployeeID INNER JOIN        Person.Contact ON HumanResources.Employee.ContactID  Person.Contact.ContactID WHERE EmployeeDepartmentHistory.EmployeeIDSELECT COUNTHumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory.EmployeeID         FROM HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory         WHERE EmployeeDepartmentHistory.EmployeeID  Employee.EmployeeID         Group by EmployeeDepartmentHistory.EmployeeID codepre
Negative 90 pIm trying to understand within my lesson how to read the below function called printBackward. How is it that when I type codeprintBackwardnode1code and my output is 3,2,1 which is what its suppose to do. I just dont understand why that is. See below how I interpret it and please school me on where I saw it wrong...p  precode class Node     def initself, cargo  None, next  None  optional parameters. cargo and the linknext are set to None.         self.cargo  cargo         self.next  next      def strself         return strself.cargo   node1  Node1 node2  Node2 node3  Node3 node1.next  node2 node2.next  node3   Exercise def printListnode      print [,     while node         print node,         node  node.next         if node  None             print ,,     print ],     print   def printBackwardlist     if list  None return     head  list           tail  list.next      printBackwardtail      print head, codepre  pSo lets say... codeprintBackwardnode1code at first, codeif listcode should be ignored since node1 contains a reference to node2 so we move to codehead  listcode which is node1. codetail  list.nextcode which I see as node1.next  node2 so tail  node2. Then we get to codeprintBackwardtailcodewhich is node2. At that point, what happens Do we do this all over again I see this going up to node3 which at that point will return None. When do we get to codeprint head,code We make a recursive call before even getting to the codeprint head,code Please educate me as Im trying to understand the examples that are given to me within my lesson.

Negative 90 pIve been reading something from Bill Karwin creator of ZendDB about models not being directly to do with database tables. I think some devs have their models a direct extension of Zendtables or so which makes it harder for adding memcached caching of objects, which makes sense.p  pSo what Bill Karwin was saying is that a Model codehascode tables and codeisnt acode table but Im still thinking the way I have it is correct as its designed in an object oriented manner.p  pFor instance just an examplep  precodeA Monster has 1M Mouth. a Mouth has 1M Tooth.  codepre  pSo in my database Id have 5 tables p  precodeMonster id, name, type MonsterMouth id, monsterid, mouthid Mouth id, size MouthTeeth id, mouthid, toothid Tooth id, size, shape, sharpness codepre  pThen the 3 classesp  precodeclass ModelMonster       private id, name, type, mouths  array     public function construct id           Set properties from DB for supplied ID          Go through DB and add the mouths based on monster ID           public function countTeeth            Loop through each mouths as mouth and call mouthgtgetTotalTeeth        class ModelMonsterMouth       private id, size, teeth  array      public function constructid           Set properties from DB for supplied ID          Go through DB and add the types of teeth for this mouth ID           public function getTotalTeeth            return sizeofteeth        class ModelTooth      private id, size, shape, sharpness     public function constructid           Populate details based on ID passed       codepre  pThen I guess methods for counting teeth and stuff...p  precodemonsterId  1 monster  new MonstermonsterId  Count total teeth totalTeeth  monstergtcountTeeth codepre  pSo a monster can have many different mouths and 1 mouth can have many different types of teeth.p  pAfter writing out this lengthy post I think Ive got it right and that codeBill Karwincode is talking about those who have code5 Modelscode rather than code3code...p  pI have code5 Tablescode but only code3 Modelscode as two tables are there to solve MM table relationships.p  pcode2 of the 3 Modelscode use composition to store many of the other type of object.p  pIf a monster had 10 mouths of between 910k of about 10 different types of teeth... would this be a performance issue I mean would PHP see it like codea,a,a,a,a,b,bcode or code5a and 2bcode. If having 1100k of an object and iteratively adding them to a composite item is slow then I guess I should only have one occurance of it with a number property to say how many there are of that type.p  pIf Ive got it correct then maybe it might help some of the other guys who are having problems with this.p  pThanks D Domp

Negative 90 pIm trying to configure my local development environment to read .less files so that I can edit .less files during development and only convert to .css when its time to go live. Make sensep  pIm running MAMP as my local testing server. Im following the instructions I found here a hrefhttpprogrammingperils.com155parselessfilesontheflyandservethemascsscomment920 relnofollowhttpprogrammingperils.com155parselessfilesontheflyandservethemascsscomment920ap  pIn short, the plan is to use an htaccess file catch requests to .css files and direct them to a PHP script which compiles the .less file of same name and returns the css code.p  pEverything seems to be working from the command line. I can compile a .less file from the command line and it spits out the css. I know my rewrite rule is working because I can type the url into a browser and see the output of my php script. For example, if my PHP script calls codeecho shellexecpwdcode I will see a path printed in the browser.p  pTHE PROBLEM is that I cant get the less script to run unless I SSH to the localhost as root. When I exit SSH and run the command I get Permission denied. I suspect this is what happens when my PHP script tries to call this... so its returning nothing.p  pI guess the question boils down to how can I get my PHP script to run the less compilerp  h1strongUPDATE I solved the problem...strongh1  pIt turns out that the less command codepathpathlessccode needed to be sudoed. PHP wasnt doing this, so the shellexec command wasnt returning anything. Thats why my echo statements DID work. p  pThere are a lot of ways to sidestep this, but I determined that editing the list of sudoers with codesudo visudocode was the best for my purposes. There was a lot of helpful tips on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3166123howtocallshellscriptfromphpthatrequiressudothis posta. Through trial and error, I figured out that PHP uses the wwwdata account. Adding this line fixed my problemp  precodewwwdata ALLALL NOPASSWD varrootnodenpmnodemoduleslessbinlessc codepre  pSomething to remember is that you STILL have to add sudo to the command that gets fed to shellexec. Hope this is helpful to someone else.p

Negative 90 pWhen installing packages in Python using pip, I came across the following error p  precodeunable to execute gcc4.2 No such file or directory codepre  pClearly, pip is trying to use gcc4.2 which is not in any of the binary directories, namely usrbin. After looking around this site and others, I have found that many others are suffering from the same issue. However, gcc is updated to version 4.2 in OS X Lion and this is not a version problem, rather, gcc is just called gcc, not gcc4.2, under usrbin, and is symlinked to llvmgcc. After adding gcc4.2 in usrbin as a symlink to gcc, pip was able to install everything successfully. Why is it then, that pip is looking for gcc4.2 and not gcc Is this the fault of pip, OS X Lion, or the packages within pip that are trying to install themselves with gcc4.2 p  pFinally, is my symlink hack the right thing to do in this situation, or should I have fixed this some other way p

I tried two methods for this with neither working a simple anchor tag with an href to the page webspace.comlogout, and putting a form with just a restyled submit button in the menu to look like a normal link, using post as the method to the same page. Both of them have this codep  precodepublic function post request       response  new Response request      responsegtcode  ResponseMOVEDPERMANENTLY     responsegtaddHeader Location,       responsegtbody  ltbgtSuccesfully logged outltbgt     SESSION[ loggedin ]  false     return response  codepre  por at least variations on that, trying various things When this code is used from the menu bar, either through an anchor tag or a form submit button, it will go to the logout page and just stay there, outputting any body text if it exists. The PHP code checking if the user is not logged in doesnt even trigger, leaving the menu bar in a state of looking like you are currently logged in, even though the moment you go to another page it changes to the logged out code, meaning you have successfully logged out already. Ive tried various things, and just going there through the browser bar directly will work fine, and not setting the session variable will also cause it to work fine. as far as Ive seen I have no idea what is going on. Thank you for any help in advance.p

I am using the repository pattern plus Ninject and Moq which means that unit testing work quite well i.e. without needing to pull data from the database.p  pIn the book repositories are used like thisp  precodepublic class EFDbTestChildRepository      private EFDbContext context  new EFDbContext      public IQueryableltTestChildgt TestChildren              get  return context.TestChildren            public void SaveTestChildTestChild testChild              if testChild.TestChildID  0                      context.TestChildren.AddtestChild                  else                      context.EntrytestChild.State  EntityState.Modified                  context.SaveChanges       codepre  pAnd here is the DbContext that goes with itp  precodepublic class EFDbContext  DbContext      public DbSetltTestParentgt TestParents  get set      public DbSetltTestChildgt TestChildren  get set   codepre  pPlease note to keep things simple in this extracted example I have left out the interface ITestChildRepository here which Ninject would then use.p  pIn other sources I have seen a more general approach for the repository where one single repository is enough for the whole application. Obviously in my case I end up with quite a list of repositories in my application  basically one for each entity in my domain model. Not sure about the pros and cons about the two approaches  I just followed the book to be on the safe side.p  pTo finally get to my question each repository has its own DbContext  codeprivate EFDbContext context  new EFDbContextcode. Do I risk ending up with multiple DbContexts within one request And would that lead to any significant performance overhead How about a potential for conflicts between the contexts and any consequences to the data integrityp  pHere is an example where I ended up with more than one repository within a controller.p  pMy two database tables are linked with a foreign key relationship. My domain model classesp  precodepublic class TestParent      public int TestParentID  get set      public string Name  get set      public string Comment  get set       public virtual ICollectionltTestChildgt TestChildren  get set    public class TestChild      public int TestChildID  get set      public int TestParentID  get set      public string Name  get set      public string Comment  get set       public virtual TestParent TestParent  get set   codepre  pThe web application contains a page that allows the user to create a new TestChild. On it there is a selectbox that contains a list of available TestParents to pick from.

Try again, and if the problem persists see your system administrator.                    something wrong with the data values         return ViewtestChild       codepre  pIts not enough to have an EFDbTestChildRepository available but I also need an EFDbTestParentRepository. Both of them are assigned to private variables of the controller  and voila, it seems to me that two DbContexts have been created. Or is that not correctp  pTo avoid the issue I tried using EFDbTestChildRepository to get to the TestParents. But that obviously will only bring up  those that are already hooked up to at least one TestChild  so not what I want.p  pHere is the code for the view modelp  precodepublic class ChildViewModel      public TestChild TestChild  get set      public IQueryableltTestParentgt TestParents  get set   codepre  pPlease let me know if I forgot to include some relevant code.

Negative 90 pI was wondering if anyone knows what the limits are on the conversiontypecast operatorp  pSo, for example, I can have the following override operatorsp  precodeclass Test      operator int  return 0      operator int  return nullptr   codepre  pFor a regular function, I could also have a pointer to array type. E.g.p  precodeint MyFunc[4]  return nullptr  codepre  pHowever, I dont know how to do the same for the conversion operator or if it is even legal to do so. I have tried a few different variations and VS2010 and none work. Such asp  precodeoperator int [4]  return nullptr  operator int[4]  return nullptr  codepre  pIm not sure if this is a limitation in VS2010 or if there is a general limit on the types that can be used in the conversion operator. I tried looking for the standard online with no luck. Does anyone know Before anyone asks why would you even want to do that, its for autogenerated code. Although I dont anticipate getting pointer to array input, I would like to be able to produce the code if it is legal in C.p

Negative 90 pIm currently building an API which is being accessed over HTTP by a mobile app. Assume the following scenario Mobile app sends an HTTP POST request to www.example.comcustomers containing registration data, the API connects to the database, inserts a new record and returns 200 OK plus some user specific registration data.p  pNow suppose that the insert in the database went fine, but the 200 OK response never made it to the mobile app, bad connectionuser switched off mobile connection etc. Obviously repeating the same POST request isnt going to work because a user with that usernameid is already present. How would I solve this and protect other functionality in the API using the same mechanismp  pAlso, while I was thinking about the above scenario, might the same problem arise between the webserver and the database server as well E.g. PHP scripts calls mysqlconnect to connect to the remote database and a call to mysqlquery is made. Could it happen that the database server committed the query but for some reason the PHP script never received the OK from the db connection due to a bad connection or anything like thatp

Negative 90 pI am creating a very simple quiz application with jQuery. How it works is you have a question and three answers. Clicking on the wrong answer makes the clicked answers opacity fade to 60. Clicking on the correct answer should make all the wrong answers fade out completely leaving only the correct answer remaining.p  pThe page has 3 quizzes selectable by a navigation. So I am sorting through tests and questions using .index to target the specific question at hand. Which works as other elements of the quiz are working fine.p  pThe only issue I am having is getting the other answers to fade out on selecting the correct answer.

Negative 90 pFor research purposes, I am trying to modify H.264 motion vectors MVs for each P and Bframe prior to motion compensation during the decoding process. I am using FFmpeg for this purpose. An example of a modification is replacing each MV with its original spatial neighbors and then using the resultant MVs for motion compensation, rather than the original ones. Please direct me appropriately.p  pSo far, I have been able to do a simple modification of MVs in the file stronglibavcodech264cavlc.cstrong. In the function, strongffh264decodembcavlcstrong, modifying the strongmxstrong and strongmystrong variables, for instance, by increasing their values modifies the MVs used during decoding.p  pFor example, as shown below, the strongmxstrong and strongmystrong values are increased by 50, thus lengthening the MVs used in the decoder.p  precodemx  getsegolombampsgtgb50 my  getsegolombampsgtgb50 codepre  pHowever, in this regard, I dont know how to access the neighbors of strongmxstrong and strongmystrong for my spatial mean analysis that I mentioned in the first paragraph. I believe that the key to doing so lies in manipulating the array, strongmvcachestrong.p  pAnother experiment that I performed was in the file, stronglibavcodecerrorresilience.cstrong. Based on the strongguessmvstrong function, I created a new function, strongmeanmvstrong that is executed in strongfferframeendstrong within the first ifstatement. That first ifstatement exits the function strongfferframeendstrong if one of the conditions is a zero errorcount serrorcount  0. However, I decided to insert my strongmeanmvstrong function at this point so that is always executed when there is a zero errorcount.

Negative 90 pIm trying to replace my svn merging workflow  which is usually codesvn diffcode, sometimes some manual editing of the patch, and then codepatchcode  with actual codesvn mergecode.  But Im seeing some unexpected behavior, and I cant find an explanation in any of the SVN documentation online.  Heres my scenariop  ol liNew repository rev. 0li liCreated a blank file called codefilecode in trunk rev. 1li liCopied trunk to branchesbranch1 rev. 2li liIn branchesbranch1, changed codefilecode to read abcdefg and committed rev. 3li liBack in trunk, ranli ol  pcodesvn merge c3 branchesbranch1 . ignoreancestrycodep  pSo far, so good.  codefilecode in trunk contains abcdefg.  And trunk did not get updated with any mergeinfo, since I used ignoreancestry.  To verify, I runp  pcodesvn pg svnmergeinfo .codep  pwhich prints out nothing.  Great.  So now I want to apply the change in r3 emagainem.  So I runp  pcodesvn merge c3 branchesbranch1 . ignoreancestrycodep  pThis command does emnothingem.  Prints out no output, does not change codefilecode, and does not add any mergeinfo.  If I do the same thing with my old diffandpatch workflow, like thisp  pcodesvn diff c3 branchesbranch1  patchcodep  pThen file is updated with the change again.  And since the change amounted to justp  precode     file    revision 2      file    revision 3      0,0 1      abcdefg codepre  papplying it again just makes codefilecode contain two lines of abcdefg, as intended.p  pp  pI know this shouldnt be a common workflow, but I feel like I need to understand what codesvn mergecode is actually doing in situations like this before I can comfortably adopt it.  No need espousing the benefits of codesvn mergecode  Im already on board.p  pThanksp

Negative 90 pI built a site using HTML5 doctype and tags.  I was doing some browser testing and I found that one part didnt work in Firefox 3.6 and FF 3.0.5, but we only support back to 3.6.

So, my brain tells me that I need to add a field to the User table to hold the ID of the image I want to be the default.p  pImages use hasattachedfile.  I dont want users to have their own attached file, I just want the user model to be able to reference a specific instance of an image that has the url helper methods available to it.p  pThe problem comes in when Im trying to get the URL for this image using the ID.  Either what Im trying to do is impossible using paperclip, or I dont have my associations set up correctly.p  pBasically I want to be able to access that image in a view, using an instance of a user model.  Sop  precodelt imagetag user.image.url gt codepre  pBut this doesnt work.  I get why it doesnt work, but I dont understand how to makep  precodeuser.image codepre  pbe an instance of a magical paperclip object that has the methods attached to it to retrieve the url.p  pBasically if I knew how to get a paperclip images URL using the images ID id be golden.

Negative 90 pI have a MainView which has an associated MainViewModel in my WPF application, assigned via its contructor.p  blockquote   pApp  emstart up uriem  MainWindow.xamlp blockquote  precode    public MainWindow              InitializeComponent          var viewModel  new MainViewModel          DataContext  viewModel      codepre  pMy MainView holds as many as four nested views or child views who are hidden and displayed based upon the button that has been clicked on the MainView. So we toggling the visibility property vi a binding which gets updated via command bindings assigned to each button on the MainView.p  pEach nested View does not have an associated ViewModel, all bindings found on child views find their information in the MainViewModel. So binding system ends waling up the UI tree of the app to find out that the parent MainView has an associated ViewModel.p  pSo overall there is ONE  ViewModel. This seems to work fine and but as expected this VM has gotten to big and needs refactoring. It holds information that contextually it should not. But this is a proof concept application. So i decided to keep it simple and make sure it was doable. p  pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pWhen i tried assigning a empty view with an empty view model I noticed binding errors in the output window and as expected weird and broken behaviour. Which makes no sense ... Is there a more clear and concise way of letting WPF know how to handle any bindings it finds in a nested view control I thought if each views constructor assigned itself a corresponding VM as shown above, then it should work as this logically makes sense. Unfortunately all buttons on the MainView stop working when the corresponding view it is designated to switch on and hide the others has an associated ViewModel. On some buttons it works and the others it does not This is really weirdp

Negative 90 pSo we want to build a serverclient system in C, and I am unclear whether Google protocol buffers or thrift will get us a working prototype more quickly. We want to use TCP sockets as the communication layer, for communication over a local subnet not over the wide internet. It will run on LinuxOS XWindows.   p  pWe mostly need simple async message passing in each direction, but we might want RPCstyle responses in the future. Most of our messages are small, but several will have large payloads of about 100k500k those would just be a big opaque buffer accompanying a message if we had to call them out in the IDL.p  pI know we want the message descriptormarshallingunmarshalling that both of them offer, but Im unclear about the other pieces needed to most quickly build a working serverclient.p  pAm I right in gathering that thrift supplies implementations for TCPIP socket communication to send and receive the messages, while Protocol Buffers only deals with the marshalling layer and doesnt know anything about sockets   p  pIf that is indeed the case, then with Protocol Buffers, youd have to write a miniprotocol on top of it to wrap some headers andor footers around the messages to identify where one stops and the next one begins as the come over the socket and the more difficult issue of resyncing if somethings longershorter than expected.

Negative 90 pUsing Java code, I am tying to manipulate another, external Java swing application, for which I have no access to any information about how it was coded. Specifically, I am trying to manipulate a JXTreeTable. One of the columns, of type Boolean, contains checkboxes. p  pOne thing Ive tried to do, is to do code a doubleclickthenspacebar action, which emhasem worked. However, my manager would like me to figure out a way to toggle the checkboxes without using the spacebar.p  pIm wondering  does anyone know a way to toggle the checkboxes using Java methods, despite me being blind to the original applications design Ive tried to use setCellData with a Boolean parameter. Oddly, calling getCellData onto the cell right after returns the value I modified it to, but the checkbox itself does not get toggled  plus, when submitting the form, its the value reflected by the checkbox thats sent in, not the Boolean in the cell.p  pIn addition, the checkboxes in the Boolean column carry labels. I have a feeling these labels are generated by the TableRenderer, but how can I grab the values on the labelsp  pNote I am executing all the Java code through an automating testing script that I am writing in QTP, to be exact. So, I am limited in a lot of the approaches I can use e.g. I cant code my own custom Java classesp

Negative 90 pI need some advice  ideas if someone is inclined to help I have a javascript interface for manipulating pictures. Basically its about moving photos around. Once its done the position of images is saved into a Django form and then saved to database with the owner saved as the current user. Now the trick is that I would like to be able to allow non registered users to play with this interface and then if they like the result they hit save and are redirected to an account registration page and only then the form is actually saved with their user as the owner.p  pWhat comes to my mind now is to keep the values of the form in session but I dont know what will happen to the session once the anonymous user registers and becomes another user. I was also thinking of using a next parameter in the registration process with the url filled with get parameters that would be the content of the form but then I dont know if userena is ready to allow that. Any light on this is welcome.p

Negative 90 pIn my program I have very few inserts, and any which are run frequently are not needed instantly and therefore have been changed to codeINSERT DELAYEDcode. Should I go through my code and see which fields are referenced in the codeWHEREcode clause and add an index for each of them If so what type of index do I use Is it just inserts that are slowed downp  pAlso can I use these indexes on any data type p
Negative 90 pSay you have the collection of keyvalue pair. for e.g.  p  precodedictionaryltstring,stringgt myObjectToBeCreated  new dictionaryltstring,stringgt myObjectToBeCreated.Addint,myIntObject myObjectToBeCreated.Addstring,myStringObject myObjectToBeCreated.Addemployee,myEmployeeObject codepre  pNow, How can you create the object of int named myIntObject using myObjectToBeCreated. something like this p  precodeint myIntObject string myStringObject Employee myEmployeeObject  new Employee codepre  pNote You have just the collection. This collection is having the dataTypes and objectnames. How can you create the object of those dataType with the specific namesdefined in dictionary. You can pass this collection MyObjectsToBeCreated in any method you want to. But at the end you should get the object of type specified in dictionary.p  pYou can use any design pattern say strongemfactorydependencybuilderemstrong. Or even you are free to achieve the above wo using pattern.p

Negative 90 pI just joined, and am glad to be here So, this morning at like 2am, but thats besides the point P  I was doing a little bit of Java tests with JFrame and other GUI stuff. This is my first time working with GUIs. I was trying to make a little java app that would act as a dream journaller. However, my progress was frozen when I encountered a problem i could not solve.

Negative 90 pI am trying to learn more about websocket and its internal implementations. But still cannt understand few things. I tried googling for a indepth explanation, but most of them just gives the highlevel overview. Following are my doubtsp  pstrong1.strong According to what I read, web socket server C  C implementation by default uses port 80. Although we can use any port, its preferred that we use port 80 as we wont have any firewall issues.  If thats so, how are we supposed to run both the webserver and web socket server on the same port 80p  pstrong2.strong Lets assume that the web socket server is running on port 81 and webserver is running on port 80.p  ol lipSo when the browser issues the initial handshake HTTP request Upgrade websocket ,  this request sent to port 81. Right If so, this request See below doesnt have any relation to an HTTP protocol. But still we use HTTP protocol headers. Whyp  precode       GET mychat HTTP1.1        Host server.example.com        Upgrade websocket        Connection Upgrade        SecWebSocketKey x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw        SecWebSocketProtocol chat        SecWebSocketVersion 13        Origin httpexample.com codepreli lipWhy dint they use the same websocket interface currently implemented in most browser to issue a direct TCPIP connection with the given port, without any HTTP stuffpli ol  pstrong3.strong  Is there any packet size limit or databuffer limit for data sentreceived from clientserver If thats the case, do we need to frame the data and handle it ourselvesp  pstrong4.strong  Does the websocket server always needs to be a separate serviceprocess In future will the webservers IIS, apache will include support for hosting web socket servers within its process spacep

Negative 90 pFirst of all, hello. Ive been trying to achieve something in quite a long time. Im trying to create a background fullscreen slideshow using jquery. I did achieve that using css animations but if you select a new tab and then go back to the tab with the css animation it starts lagging like hell. I assume that this wouldnt happen if using jquery. Also, i tried to create it as simple as possible WITHOUT using the already built jquery slideshow plugins but i couldnt.p  hr  pAnd now i got an idea.

Negative 90 pWe currently have a major issue using Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010. The engine comes in 64bit and 32bit forms, which is good. However, apparently you need to always install the 32bit version if the host process is always 32bit. Fine, we can do this.p  pOur software deals with a lot of legacy components that are 32bit, and much of it is in VB6 code, which generates 32bit assembly. So, we are under the assumption that the driver must also be installed as 32bit. Indeed, when we install 32bit drivers on a 64bit machine, and run our 32bit applications, it works correctly.p  pHowever, the problem begins when Office 2010 64bit is installed on the system. Trust me, weve tried to educate users that 64bit Office is largely unnecessary, to no avail. As computers come off the assembly line with 64bit versions installed, were unable to keep up with support requests when our software breaks something. Either the 64bit Office breaks our installation, or our installation breaks their Office version, but its not pretty either way. A further issue is that nonlegacy software will sometimes install the 64bit drivers as they should, and the two versions simply do not coexist in any reasonable manner. Either our software breaks, or their software breaks.p  pSo, has anybody managed to find a way to make the 32bit drivers coexist with 64bit installations I have seen that installing with codepassivecode flag allows the two to be installed, and our installer does use passive. Both are being installed, but once on the system either our software no longer works, or Office constantly repairs its installation. Is there any reasonable way to make this workp

Negative 90 pIve been learning rails for the last week or so and Im just starting to get into BDD. A typical example in any cucumber or rspec tutorial is to ensure a successerror message is displayed as a check that an action succeeded or failed.p  pThis means there is now a constant message, such as Your message is delivered successfully twice in the code  one in the application and another in the tests. This is strange to me... it isnt DRY, which rails developers live by, and if you wanted to change the message to something else, you have to do it twice.p  pIs this standard Ive read about en.yml in the locales directory and was wondering if anyone used it for their strings. I havent seen this in any tutorials so far which is why Im asking. Are the strings in en.yml visible to cucumberrspec tests If so, how do I access them in code If en.yml isnt the way to go, how do rails developers store their constant string valuesp

I have the password the user typed it. I need to get a token so I can make the calls through Curl. What is the easiest way to accomplish thisp  pstrongUpdate 1strong p  pAfter going through the documentation, it seems that the least painful OAuth2 flow will be the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2InstalledAppInstalled Applicationa one.p  pWhat I am thinking is that my command line tool will make requests for public tables without needing a token but it seems we still need to be sending an AppID from Google which I can get from the Google APIs dashboard.p  pWhenever my command line tool will need to use a private resource, that user would be required to supply a Google supplied emauthorization codeem which my command line tool can then use to get a usable emtokenem. If the user has not supplied the emauthorization codeem in the command line, my tool would just print a link that the user can paste to the URL to generate the authorization code. The link would look like thisp  pa hrefhttpsaccounts.google.comooauth2authscopehttpswww.googleapis.comauthfusiontablesampredirecturiurn3aietf3awg3aoauth2.03aoobampresponsetypecodeampclientid812741506391h38jh0j4fv0ce1krdkiq0hfvt6n5amrf.apps.googleusercontent.comhttpsaccounts.google.comooauth2authscopehttpswww.googleapis.comauthfusiontablesampredirecturiurnietfwgoauth2.0oobampresponsetypecodeampclientid812741506391h38jh0j4fv0ce1krdkiq0hfvt6n5amrf.apps.googleusercontent.comap  pOnce the user accepts, she would have to paste that emauthorization codeem to the terminal so it can be used by the command line tool. The command line tool would use the authorization code to ask Google for a emtokenem and then, finally, I can then use the Google token to make the API calls.p  pA few things are still unclear to me. Does the authorization code change If so, it seems I would need to save the token and refresh tokens somewhere so I can reuse the refresh token every time the token expires.p  pIs it just me, or does this whole thing seems like crazy talk just so that I can use a Google API from the command linep  pI would normally use the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsAuthForInstalledAppsClientLogin flowa, but everything seems to point out that it will be deprecated soon.p

I have been able to group the words based on starting letter using the following codep  precodepublic string AlphabeticWordBuilder      ListltStringgt words  this.myWords.WordsAsList     words.Sort     return GroupWordswords   private static string GroupWordsListltStringgt words      String formatedWords  string.Empty     var groups          from w in words         group w by w.First     foreach var group in groups              formatedWords  n  group.Key  n         foreach var w in group                      formatedWords  w                   return formatedWords  codepre  pHowever this method requires me to convert the keys of my dictionary into a list causing me to lose my values. I should be able to group my dictionary by the value in a similar fashion but I do not know how to incorporate the keyvalue relationship into the code I am using for the alphabetic sorting. Can someone please post an example of using LINQ to group a dictionary by valuep  pAlso Id like to avoid the LINQ method syntax and continue to use the LINQ query expression syntax shown above if possible.p  pstrongExample output alphabeticallystrongp  pWords starting with ap  blockquote   pand adventure a an ect.p blockquote  pstrongExample output by frequencystrongp  pWords occurring 1 timesp  blockquote   pstuff and problems p blockquote  pstrongAn incomplete example of what Im trying to dostrongp  precodepublic string FrecquincyWordBuilder      string fromatedWords  string.Empty     var groups          from w in this.myWords         group w by w.value   codepre

I made a few more changes but realized it was too soon to commit to Master, so I didnt commit to Master. li liInstead, I created and switched to another new branch called IA481Release2 and I committed the merged files to that second new branch not to Master.li liSomeone else switched to the IA481Release2 branch to check out my work, and made some checkins.li ol  pLater we find out that the IA481 commit I originally made to the IA481Release2 branch somehow wound up in the Master Branch.  and Im trying to figure out how it got there. Was it the commit called Merge branch IA481Release2 made by that other person that merged it with Master, or was it already in Master with my IA481 checkin. At which commit did things go wrongp

Negative 90 pIm modeling a data warehouse which has 6 dimension. One of these dimensions is client, which has around 600k rows, and some others such as accounts and products. I made an estimation of the number of rows of the fact table by multiplying the cardinality of each dimension table, giving 11012 rows as result. My question is, if a client doesnt have a certain product, is there gonna be a row for that product with cero value in the fact table, or there wont be a row at all I need this information to know if my aproximation will be a upper boundary for the number of rows, or will be the exact number of rows.p

Negative 90 pI am developing a reasonably complex iOS Application. To rationalise development, I have begin developing each module as a standalone project, which are then composed together in the toplevel Application project, resulting in a tree of dependencies.p  pI have taken this approach successfully before, but this time around have a shared dependency C which causes a problemp  precode     A              B  C  D         C   E     C codepre  pWhere A is the toplevel Application project, and C is a Core Library of functions. This core library is a dependency of A itself, as well as modules B and D. strongThe resulting multiple complilation causes duplicate symbols in the build folder and failed linking.strongp  pNow, I can be pragmatic and just remove the reference from A, as this will be compiled into the build folder by B anyway, and if D wasnt involved, this would just work.  But how do I go about resolving the  duplication of C dependency from B and D  strongThe B and D projects still need a reference to C when I compile them standalonestrong, but there is a clash when compiled twice in the context of A.p  pI can imagine some convoluted solution using objcopy and giving them unique prefixes, but this would be somewhat inefficient as its the same code. I could live with this, but is there a better way Perhaps some compiler or linker flag to reuse an existing symbol in the build folder if one exists, instead of compiling againp  pThanks for any advice.p

Negative 90 pI need to parse and manipulate Times without Dates in my code. For example i might get the string 1500 from a timepicker. I want to turn this into a Time object of some kind  I normally work in Python which has distinct Date, Time, and Datetime objects.p  pHowever all the solutions ive seen focus on using the Date object. This cannot parse a string like 1500 since it requires day information. I dont want to add arbitrary Date information to Times  especially since Date appears to make assumptions about things like daylight saving depending on the day and the locale, and there appears to be a risk of it automatically attempting to translate the time into a given locale. Furthermore I want to be able to add times, e.g. 1500  1 hourp  pWhat is the recommended solution to parse and handle raw times not associated to datesp

Negative 90 pI am implementing an app which does a lot of networking calls to a restapi that we also control. Recently we decided to introduce caching headers on the server side to save some valuable networking and server time. As we do not know beforehand for how long the data will be valid, we are not sending codeCachecontrol maxagecode or codeExpirescode headers, all we do is send a codeLastModifiedcode header together with a codeEtagcode, so we always hit the server but responses are pretty fast most of the times with a code304code.  Everything seemed to work fine at first, with many requests being cached. However, strongI am experiencing some random data errorsstrong on the app due to the caching.p  pFor some reason I can not understand, strongat some point requests are being locally cached and used as updated data without hitting the serverstrong, when they actually are not. The problem keeps there until some time passes. Then everything goes to server normally again, exactly as it would behave with a codecachecontrolcode header, but without it. So, my question isp  hr  pHow can codeNSURLCachecode together with codeNSURLConnectioncode decide that a particular request does not need to go online when the original request did not come with codeCachecontrol maxagecode or codeExpirescode headers Has anyone experienced similar effects And how can I solve it without removing the whole cachep  hr  pSome more background infop  ul liI am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworkingAFNetworkinga, but it relies on codeNSURLConnectioncode so I do not think it changes anythingli liThe cache used is the default code[NSURLCache sharedURLCache]code instanceli lipIt is a codeGETcode request, and when I check the headers from the cached response this is what I getp  pcodepo [response allHeaderFields]codep  precodeAccessControlAllowHeaders  ContentType AccessControlAllowMethods  GET, POST, DELETE, PUT AccessControlAllowOrigin   Connection  keepalive ContentEncoding  gzip ContentLength  522 ContentType  applicationjson Date  Mon, 02 Sep 2013 080038 GMT Etag  044ad6e73ccd45b37adbe1b766e6cd50c LastModified  Sat, 31 Aug 2013 103606 GMT Server  nginx1.2.1 SetCookie  JSESSIONID893A59B6FEFA51566023C14E3B50EE1E Pathrestapi HttpOnly codepreli lipI can not predict or reproduce when the error is going to happen so solutions that rely on deleting the cache are not an option.pli liI am using iOS5li ul

Negative 90 pI have an html editor custom control that Ive been working on that has a basic undoredo function that works well with all the functions that are part of the editor. The undoredo function works off of 2 stacks respectively named UndoStack and RedoStack, which when one of the other editor functions that modify the text property of the editor occur push on to the UndoStack.  For visualization, when Undo is clicked, pop is called and that value is stored to the redo stack.p  pHowever, the editor also interacts with some onpage AJAX functions that allow the user to insert already written text stored in our database.  What I want to accomplish here is to include the the JavaScript that is used to run the editor on the page and call the functions needed to push text on to the undo stack from the page.p  pAs a side note, I used the solution provided by Rob2211 on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5633258embeddeddllresourcesEmbedded dll resourcesa to get the script file on the page in question, but I would like to know how to call a function from it as it keeps saying that the function I want to call pushUndoStack, excuse the lack of creativity is undefined.p  pThanksp  pP.S.

Negative 90 pThe problem definition is,p  pSome people paste copied text from some websites in to the text editor. And the copied context contains links, images, codeltpgtcode, codeltstronggtcode and many HTML tags. And I want to edit the attributes of the contained HTML tags.p  pSample situation I copy a status from my Facebook feed in which I have tagged my friend and a page, and paste it in CKEditor. So it looks like this codelta hrefprofilelinkhere classprofilelinkgtcode. So when I submit the CKEditor the link is with the class strongprofilelinkstrong. But usually I add a class stronginnerlinkstrong to the links in the CKEditor. Based on this class I apply stylings and jQuery actions to the link where I display the content submitted.p  pSo how can I alter the pasted codes attributes in the CKEditorp

Negative 90 pThis is really less of a practical question, and more theoretical, but it does affect some code that I am currently writing, so Ill go ahead and ask.p  pIm using JQuery to parse an XML feed and build page elements, based on the returned XML elements.  The XML is converted into a JQuery object and getting to the elements is all well and good.p  pAt one point, when I am retrieving values, I test to see if an element exists and retrieve its contents using code.textcode.  I wanted to be careful and check to make sure that my selector had returned something before checking for the text, but noticed something funny . . . code.textcode doesnt seem to care.  If JQuery object that is returned by the selector is empty, code.textcode will return codecode when used on it.p  pPretty cool, I thought, until I realized that the behavior is different with code.htmlcode and code.valcode . . . code.htmlcode returns codenullcode and code.valcode returns codeundefinedcode in Firefox . . . in IE, they both return codeundefinedcode.p  pTry it outp  precodevar tempVal  noWayThisISAnElement window.console.logtempVal.text           returns  window.console.logtempVal.html           returns null undefined, in IE window.console.logtempVal.val            returns undefined codepre  pstrongSo, does anyone know what the reasoning behind this isstrongp  pThe main reason that I ask is that, considering that they are looking for similar kinds of values conceptually, you would think that the oops, cant do that result would be the same.p  pI guess I can see that code.valcode might be different that the other two, because it can return one of three data types, but even if you remover that, both code.textcode and code.htmlcode return strings, and those strings represent the content of the DOM node . . . you would they would both give a similar result when the JQuery object holds no reference to a node.p  pSo, I guess Ill just code differently for the to situations for now, but, in the meantime, does anyone have any insight herep  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong  Kevin B brings up a good point not sure why I didnt think of it, actually   D    about code.valcode in that it is looking for the codevaluecode attribute, which is undefined.  Thats consistent with how code.attrcode behaves in this situation as well.p  pThe difference between code.textcode and code.htmlcode is still open, though.   p

Negative 90 pWell, I have  a simple app I can load a picture, scale it with bicubic filtering, and get the average greyscale copy of it. They can be saved to a .BMP image then or processed as vertex attributes later on.p  pThe main problem is the amount of data I have to work with, and the complexity of the functions operating on the data arrays.p  pLets say I have a picture with size of 256256. To scale it to 20482048 with bicubic interpolation, it takes 152 seconds. The problem is not saving the data to a file, because it takes less than a second. The interpolating function pretty complex to run through the dataset fast. This data set is not necessarily a picture.p  pSo, I want to strongoperate on large amounts of datastrong fast, but doing it strongon CPU is pretty slowstrong. Saying I want to work on a code20 000  20 000code picture, the simple bicubic interpolation may take hours, and I havent tested normal map generation yet.p  pIve Googled, and Ive found OpenCL Im using OpenGL now, but I think its very different. So as I understand I can strongmove the calculations to the GPUstrong with it. Ive also read OpenCV is a pretty fast image processing lib.p  pStaying at GPU, it can process vertices, fragments, but for a code20k  20kcode image theres no such a resolution. As I know most GPUs support a max resolution of code4k4kcode, but maybe thats wrong. How can it work on larger sets than the max resolution maybe my logic is wrong, but if I save the calculated data with fragment shader to a texture to read it back on CPU, it cant have any resolution.p  pemIs GPGPU similar to transform feedback, and is it even faster if so then why than CPU processing Has GPU processing disadvantages to CPU processing And what kind of tasks, calculations should I use GPUs for, I mean when is it faster to use GPU than CPUemp  pstrongEDITstrong one idea came to my mind according to my last question in this post if theres much codeifstatementcodes in my algorithm, is it a good idea to move it to GPU This is one example, maybe there are more. I have an ATI card, and I have to write my own functions for these filterings.p

Negative 90 pI have been assigned the task of creating a set of cards like on Google one and other similar sites using AngularJS for a dashboard. Each card has independent functionality from the rest and they all must appear as soon as their data has been returned from the API. In the future we are going to allow for the pinningunpinning of these cards to the dashboard, as well as ordering to be customized by the user.p  pI have created a carddealer directive that will contain an ngrepeat for each card in an array of card objects. Each of these cards needs to have their own dynamic template and controller, which is where I have ran into an issue. I was able to figure out how to pass in a dynamic codetemplateUrlcode, but the controller is a different story. I have all but got it figured out by mimicking what I watched on a Pluralsight video, I should just be able to pass a codecard.controllercode variable into the directive ctrl attribute like thisp  precodeltcarddealer ngrepeatcard in cards cardcard ctrlcard.controllergt codepre  pHowever, the codectrlcard.controllercode variable in the directive is not being parsed before it is sent to the directive. In the directive I set the controller dynamically by setting codecontroller code and codename ctrlcode. This looks into the element for the attribute named ctrl and returns its value as the name of the controller. This method works when I type in the string name of the directive controller instead of using the codecard.controllercode variable, but simply typing a string isnt dynamic.p  pI need the variable to be parsed before it reaches the directive so that it looks for the proper controller name. I have created a JS Fiddle to demonstrate my issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netkPdCk relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netkPdCka. This should return two alert boxes, one representing each directive controller. If you run this currently, youll see in the console log that it is trying to search for a controller with the name of the variable instead of the value of the variable.p  pPlease help This is crucial to the future of our entire dashboard, once we figure out how to pass in a dynamic controller name we will be golden. Thanks in advancep

This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions such as an incoming phone call or SMS message or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition to the background state.      Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and throttle down OpenGL ES frame rates. Games should use this method to pause the game.    voidapplicationDidEnterBackgroundUIApplication application       Use this method to release shared resources, save user data, invalidate timers, and store enough application state information to restore your application to its current state in case it is terminated later.       If your application supports background execution, this method is called instead of applicationWillTerminate when the user quits.    voidapplicationWillEnterForegroundUIApplication application       Called as part of the transition from the background to the inactive state here you can undo many of the changes made on entering the background.    voidapplicationDidBecomeActiveUIApplication application       Restart any tasks that were paused or not yet started while the application was inactive.

Negative 90 pFor my application I am using a combination of PythonQtPySide. I need to read from and write to XML. Currently I have implemented some part of functionality using Pythons standard codeElementTreecode module. But it has its drawbacks  for example I cannot do pretty printing of tabbed XML elemens but it rather prints everything in one line, which is machine readable but human undreadable. I cannot use CDATA elements without some hacks... etc.p  pI tried also Pythons codexml.dom.minidomcode module but after I read certain criticism on the web, I am reluctant to continue with it. There are other libraries such as codelxmlcode but I do not want to introduce more nonstandard dependencies to my application.p  pSo I was thinking because I am already depending on Qt libraries, whether I should use Qt for all my work with XML. It has codeQXmlStreamWritercode, codeQXmlStreamReadercode, codeQDomcode classes etc., all of which I have experience when working with CQt. So, is this a good strategy Are there any drawbacks Are Qt XML libraries better speed, memory, robustness... than Pythons or the opposite is truep

Negative 90 pIve read countless posts on differences between Entities and Value objects and while I do think that at least conceptually I understand how the two differ, it appears that in some of these posts authors consider a particular domain concept to be a VO simply because it is immutable  thus its state will never change, at least within that particular domain model .p  pDo you agree that if the state of an object will never change within particular domain model, then this object should never be an entity Whyp  pthank youp

Negative 90 pSo Im working on implementing shadow mapping. So far, Ive rendered the geometry depth, normals, colors to a framebuffer from the cameras point of view, and rendered the depth of the geometry from the lights point of view. Now, Im rendering the lighting from the cameras point of view, and for each fragment, Im to compare its distance to the light, to the depth tex value from the renderfromthelightspov pass. If the distance is greater, its in shadow. Just recapping here to make sure there isnt anything I dont realize I dont understand.p  pSo, to do this last step, I need to convert the depth value [01] to its eyespace value [0.1100] my nearfar planes. explanation here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6652253gettingthetruezvaluefromthedepthbufferGetting the true z value from the depth buffera.p  pIs there any reason to not instead just have the renderfromthelightspov pass just write to a texture the distance of the fragment to the camera the z component directly Then we wont have to deal with the ridiculous conversion Or am I missing somethingp

Negative 90 pI am using Marathon Java desktop application testing tool to automate regression testing. Marathon uses Jython so I can use Java libraries and Python libraries.

The only way I could see around this issue is if there was some sort of statement like codetry for x secondscode and move on if component is not found.

Negative 90 h2Some Background On My Issueh2  pI have an application that reads from two serial ports.  These serial ports are tapping into messages between two pieces of hardware that are custom made by the company I work for. One serial port is tapping into the messages from hardware A to hardware B, while the other carries the messages in the other direction. I need to read, parse, and display these messages in order to help debug issues that we have been having with apparently dropped and duplicate messages.  strongMore than anything else, my application must display the messages as they are sent i.e., in the order that they are sent emandem the number of times they are sent, and with the correct timestamp.strong  p  pMy application is written in java, and interfaces with the serial ports via RxTx.  I have been running my application on a 64bit Windows 7 PC.p  pThe vast majority of the messages that are sent in both directions are strongrequestsstrong and strongACKs acknowledgements of those requestsstrong.  Each request message contains a sequence number and the  corresponding ACK will contain the same sequence number.  When the system is not busy, my program seems to work near perfectly.  However, when the messages start coming very quickly, I experience issues with my program.p  pThe problem that I am experiencing is that it seems that my application is reading multiple messages from one serial port and strongthenstrong reading from the other one, rather than reading from both near simultaneously.p  pThe core of my application uses 5 threads.  Two of these are readers that only read a byte from the port and then place that byte in a queue.  Each of these queues is shared with another thread that parses these bytes into a message. So there are two processing threads, one for each reader.  Then, both of these processing threads places these parsed messages into the another queue.  A fifth thread that manages the displaying of these messages then takes messages from this queue.   p  pUnmentioned above is my GUI, which runs through the EDT.p  pIt seems to me like the problem lies in or possibly before the reader threads, and it appears to have something to do with concurrency or something like sharing CPU timeslices.  I just dont know if this holdup is occurring at the OS level the operating system reading from one port than the other, at the RxTx level, or in my code.p  pMy reader threads code is at the bottom of this question.p  h2My Reasoningh2  ol lipI affiliate each byte with a timestamp that includes a microsecond approximation which is obtained via a technique adapted from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma130016733498081Jason Smiths answer to another questiona. When Ive see that I am reading multiple messages from one port port A and emthenem from the other port port B, I have noticed that the timestamp and hence the time of reading of the first byte of the first message read from port B occurred strongafterstrong the timestamp of the first byte of emanyem of the messages read from port A.  In other words, it appears that the port A reader thread never yielded to the port B reader thread, despite calling codeThread.yieldcode after reading each byte as can be seen in the reader thread code at the bottom of this question.  To illustrate, I have seen sequences of messages like this  p  precode[From Hardware A, To Hardware B] [Timestamp 0 us] Request for 0x01 [From Hardware A, To Hardware B] [Timestamp 60 us] ACK for 0x02 [From Hardware A, To Hardware B] [Timestamp 120 us] ACK for 0x03 [From Hardware B, To Hardware A] [Timestamp 180 us] ACK for 0x01 [From Hardware B, To Hardware A] [Timestamp 240 us] Request for 0x02 [From Hardware B, To Hardware A] [Timestamp 300 us] Request for 0x03 codepre  pBut I would expect these messages to arrive like this  p  precode[From Hardware A, To Hardware B] [Timestamp 0 us] Request for 0x01 [From Hardware B, To Hardware A] [Timestamp 60 us] ACK for 0x01 [From Hardware B, To Hardware A] [Timestamp 120 us] Request for 0x02 [From Hardware A, To Hardware B] [Timestamp 180 us] ACK for 0x02 [From Hardware B, To Hardware A] [Timestamp 240 us] Request for 0x03 [From Hardware A, To Hardware B] [Timestamp 300 us] ACK for 0x03   codepreli lipI know that this issue lies in my code rather than in the other pieces of hardware because I am seeing ACKs that have been timestamped as having arrived before the requests to which the ACK is responding.  This is programmatically impossible, because the hardware that is sending the ACK would not know the sequence number or type of message to send if it had not received the request prior to sending the ACK.pli lipI have decreased the time required by the reader thread to place a byte that has been read in the queue to about 1.5 uSec based on the average benchmark after reading and queuing 500,000 bytes.  The fastest I have seen messages coming in is around 1 message per 50 to 60 uSec, so if the two reader threads were yielding to each other after reading a byte, I embelieveem that the timestamps of the first byte read from messages on each serial port to be fairly accurate.pli ol  h2The Bottom Lineh2  pThe solutions that have occurred to me have included changing the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12317576stablealternativetorxtxexternal library I use to communicate with serial portsa, somehow fixing my code if the issue lies in it, running my application on PC with a linuxbased OS, or somehow rewriting at least the reading component of my application in a lowerlevel language than java.p  pEach of these solutions could be the solution I need, or they could be a deadend and a huge waste of time.  Hopefully one of you has dealt with this issue before or sees an issue that I havent so I can reduce the amount of time I waste trying to deal with this problemp  h2My Readers Logich2  pMy reader is a private inner class.

Negative 90 pso I recently bought web hosting from whois.com and Im trying to set up some mysql databases for my website. Im pretty much new at this, but Ive been running into a problem.p  pI was having issues connecting to my database using the user I had created in cpanel, arbit3acsecurelocalhost. So after some research, I thought Id try dropping the anonymous user localhost to resolves this issue. However, I discovered I didnt have the privileges to do that.p  pSo, I went to check my user privileges and found theres just one account, arbit3ac, which corresponds to the admin and ftp accounts for my server whos.com set it up that way initially.p  pThe privileges for that arbit3ac account is set to USAGE, which is apparently a fancy way of saying none at all. So I thought maybe Id grant privileges to that user, only the ISGRANTABLE column is set to NO.p  pSo, theres only this one account, I dont seem to have a root account of any kind, and this account isnt capable of doing really anything. I did manage to make a database and a corresponding user for that database in cpanel, but I cant create any top level users in cpanel or at least, I dont know how. They all have the prefix arbit3ac, and they dont appear in the USERPRIVILEGES table even after Ive made them in cpanel.p  pI tried to do some research on the matter, but every solution Ive seen so far involves either SQL commands that I dont have the privileges for, commands with broken syntax, or console commands which I dont know how to do, or even that I can do, since I dont have the server right here with me, I pay for web hosting through a third party.p  pDoes anyone have any idea on what I can do from here on Keep it simple and explain your answers please, Im new to mysql Ive seen a lot of answers while trying to research a fix for this that seem to just handwave crucial steps, which leaves me clueless and frustrated.p

Negative 90 pIn Excel 2010 VBA, Im using the FileExists property of the FileSystemObject to check whether a file exists. On my computer it works fine.

Negative 90 pIm working on a virtual game board style game in which players get points on a certain area of the board. Take it easy on me now as I only do this as a hobby so I might be doing this in the worst way possiblep  pI have 3 tables. One stores all the player information eg. id, screenname. A second stores all the Area information eg. id, x, y and a third stores how many points each player has in each area eg. id, playerid, areaid, points.

See code below with some commentingp  pI looked into MySQL caching, but I dont have access to a lot of the server options, as well as would like to keep as much of the results as live as possible, so caching may not be the right way to go.p  pMy question is whether or not Im doing this properly. Currently there is only around 10 players, and approx. 500 areas. Im finding the below script already takes about 58 seconds to run.

Negative 90 pI have a PHP webpage containing several php scripts. In the first script I create an object, which is needed by all scripts. In general I want to avoid globals, so how can I send an object from one script to another scriptp  pMy first point of thought was to use codeSERVER[object]myobjectcode. But I realized that this is not working. So Im looking for another solution.  In the past years I used codePHPSELFcode, but that was used in forms. In this case I do not have any forms and this object is created before a session is started and will be uses also outside sessions. Is there another optionp

Negative 90 pIm new to jQuery and just started experimenting on dataTables  client side processing.I know that for clientside processing of dataTables all the data needs to be fetched at once  from server, but I still need to fetch some data on an event trigger and reload the dataTable again with the new data fetched. What Im doing is fetch a list of JSON data from server side via AJAX call on the change event of a dropdown box. The ajax response is fed to a html table and after the table is populated I set a dataTable for it. So each time I select a different entry in the dropdown I need to triger this ajax and reload the datatable if it already exists.

Negative 90 pI have a VS solution that used to build fine.

Negative 90 pI have a situation where I have to join a table multiple times. Most of them need to be left joins, since some of the values are not available. How to overcome the query poor performance when joining multiple timesp  h1The Scenarioh1  h3Tablesh3  p[Project] ProjectId Guid, Name VARCHARMAX.br [UDF] EntityId Guid, EntityType Char1, UDFCode Guid, UDFName varchar20br [UDFDetail] UDFCode Guid, Description VARCHARMAXp  pRelationshipbr [Project].ProjectId  [UDF].EntityIdbr [UDFDetail].UDFCode  [UDF].UDFCodep  pThe UDF table holds custom fields for projects, based on the UDFName column. The value for these fields, however, is stored on the UDFDetail, in the column Description. I have lots of custom columns for Project, and they are stored in the UDF table. p  pSo for example, to get two fields for the project I do the following select p  precodeSELECT      p.Name ProjectName,     ud1.Description Field1,      ud1.UDFCode Field1Id,     ud2.Description Field2,     ud2.UDFCode Field2Id FROM     Project p     LEFT JOIN UDF u1 ON         u1.EntityId  p.ProjectId AND u1.ItemNameField1     LEFT JOIN UDFDetail ud1 ON         ud1.UDFCode  u1.UDFCode     LEFT JOIN UDF u2 ON         u2.EntityId  p.ProjectId AND u2.ItemNameField2     LEFT JOIN UDFDetail ud2 ON         ud2.UDFCode  u2.UDFCode codepre  h1The Problemh1  pImagine the above select but joining with like 15 fields.  In my query I have around 10 fields already and the performance is not very good. It is taking about 20 seconds to run. I have good indexes for these tables, so looking at the execution plan, it is doing only index seeks without any lookups. Regarding the joins, it needs to be left join, because Field 1 might not exist for that specific project.p  h1The Questionh1  pIs there a more performatic way to retrieve the data How would you do the query to retrieve 10 different fields for one project in a schema like thisp

Negative 90 pHi Im having troubles upgrading my typeahead js from 0.9.3 to 0.10.5.

Negative 90 pI currently have a logging solution that defines a macro like thisp  precodedefine MYLOGlevel, component, message, ...  MyLogInstancegtLoglevel, component, message, FILE, LINE, VAARGS  codepre  pThe const char message parameter is using a printf like format, like emMy name is s and I am u.emp  pThe actual logging method I am using is that I declaring a emchar buffer[2048]em variable on the stack and I am using vsnprintf to convert my valist param, as defined in my message parameter, into my buffer. However, as I am often handling values that can be quite bigger than 2k, my buffer is always truncated so I thought about reworking the whole thing around stringstream which would be more flexible.p  pWhen implementing this solution, I encountered a problem with retrieving my vaargs parameters from my list to use with the ltlt operator... Is my only solution available is to parse the whole message parameter for  values and retrieve them by using vaarg with the type retrieved I also need to push the text between my  values, so vsnprintf was really handy, as now I would need to split strings on  to push the previous text into my stringstream... Any hint or idea to help me out with this issuep  pI cant use external libs for this and as I support platforms and compilers that may or may not support C11, I cant entirely rely on new language features, but adding define to support both implementation is feasible. Also, as tons of traces are already in the current codebase, I cant really change the message format.p  pThanksp
Negative 90 pI really dont fully understand how these things work. The docs are clear enough to get the general idea, but I cant figure out how they are called. p  pI have this issue where I have a Unix timestamp in seconds that needs to display as a readable date in the UI, but be saved to the server in its original format. Previously I was using the jQuery UI datepicker, and made a custom directive with formatters and parsers that would take care of the transformations. Worked great. p  pThen I decided to ditch the jQuery to lighten the payload of the app, and so have switched to using ngQuickDate  a hrefhttpsgithub.comadamalbrechtngQuickDate relnofollowhttpsgithub.comadamalbrechtngQuickDatea  which is great actually.p  pBUT it has its own pipeline of formatters and parsers, and relies on a js Date object residing in the model. pp  pIve been banging my head on this all day trying to figure out if my directive could play nice with this other one. It stands to reason that I should be able to put my directive there and have my parsing and formatting functions inject into the pipeline and work as expected, except that the date picker directive directly references modelValue in several places and so actually bypasses the pipeline as far as I can tell. p  pIs there a way to make reference the value as transformed by my formatter, rather than the direct modelValue I tried viewValue but that didnt work. pp  pI dont really understand how the formatters and parsers get invoked I guess. Thats my main question. p

Negative 90 pWe are working on a large Node based ERP project and there is some internal debate as to where the bulk of the business rules should reside in a Node environment. Given that Node is single threaded albeit nonblocking it seems to make sense to put the business rules in a separate midtier a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqwekU.jpg relnofollowOption 3a for more effective load balancing as well as providing a more robust public REST API that exposes the business rules rather than a simple CRUD interface. However, it seems that midtiers have fallen out of favor recently. In a multithreaded Java or .Net environment the case could be made to put the business rules behind one main REST API Option 2. Or, the business rules could live in the web tier Option 1, but the public REST API would simply provide CRUD without the business rules. This topic can get a bit intense at times, but we are interested in any constructive suggestions and comments regarding the various options.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqwekU.jpg relnofollowArchitectural Options click hereap
Negative 90 pIm having an irritating problem with my Wordpress site I was hoping you might be able to help me with.p  pBasically, I have a page  Case Studies, which was called casestudies in the nav structure. It was later removed and readded, forcing it to casestudies2. Is there any way of editing this I tried changing the permalink within the page itself but it reverts to casestudies2 after being changed.p  pMy second issue is with the custom post type Case Study which ties into this page. I can get the page to pull the custom posts in a list, but their permalink goes to a 404 and resetting the permalink structure didnt fix itp  pLastly, my attempts to resolve this problem have led to my Case Studies page bouncing back to the homepage no matter what I do with the template file.p  pThanks in advance folks, Graham p
Negative 90 pIm currently about to write aio support for a kernel module I wrote for communication with a fast device 125 MBs in an embedded environment. To get started, I wanted to look at a few examples on how to approach this, so I ran codegrep ri aiowrite .code in a 3.13 kernel.p  pHowever, upon further inspection, I noticed that emmostem if not emallem fs drivers actually perform codeaiowritecode and codeaioreadcode synchronously. At most, they make use of vectored inputs to save on buffer allocation.p  pThe only driver I was able to find, which actually supports asynchronous aio, is the gadget USB driver, codedriversusbgadgetinode.ccodep  ol liDoes this observation mean Im likely emnotem to benefit from writing my own aio routinesli liAre codelibaiocode, codelibrtcode considered emgood enoughem for my target bandwidthli liIs this feature emtoo newem or emvery controversialem and likely to be gone in a few kernels timeli ol  pI already noticed that pinning multiple user pages and DMAing them out to my peripheral is actually strongslowerstrong than just codecopyfromusercode them to a codePAGESIZEcode codekmalloccoded buffer and loop a few times.p  pI fear that I might be putting a lot of time and effort into aio when it would actually end up slower than my simplistic codereadcodecodewritecode approach of copying user buffers over and DMAing them out synchronously and blocking until the DMA is done.p  pId be grateful for some experienced users insights into this to help me evaluate aio.p

Negative 90 pIm using cycle2 a hrefhttpjquery.malsup.comcycle2 relnofollowhttpjquery.malsup.comcycle2a to hold a number of jquery accordions which are different heights. Im using cycle2 autoheightcontainer to resize the container which works fine on resize or when moving between slides.p  pHowever when im viewing a specific slide and openclose an accordion section the cycle2 container height doesnt update to match so its too short. This makes sense as cycle2 uses absolutely positioned slides with explicit heights which only update on resize or when moving between slides.p  pCan anyone suggest the best way to allow the container to grow in height at the same speed as the accordion module opens so it all displays correctlyp  pWith Cycle2 i can trigger a window resize after opening an accordion section but this makes the transition horrible as it doesnt update the container size until after the related section has opened. I dont need to use cycle2 if there is a better wayp  pThanks everyone,p  pDavep

Negative 90 pIm trying to find a way to parse potentially malformed HTML in Python and, if a set of conditions are met, output that piece of the document with the position line, column. The position information is what is tripping me up here. And to be clear, I have no need to build an object tree. I simply want to find certain pieces of data and their position in the original document think of a spell checker, for example word foo at line x, column y, is misspelledp  pAs an example I want something like this using ElementTrees a hrefhttpeffbot.orgelementtreeelementtreexmlparser.htm relnofollowTarget APIap  precodeimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET  class EchoTarget     def startself, tag, attrib         if somecondition             print start, tag, attrib, self.getpos     def endself, tag         if somecondition             print end, tag, self.getpos     def dataself, data         if somecondition             print data, reprdata, self.getpos  target  EchoTarget parser  ET.XMLParsertargettarget parser.feedltpgtsome textltpgt parser.close  codepre  pHowever, as far as I can tell, the codegetposcode method or something like it doesnt exist. And, of course, that is using an XML parser. I want to parse potentially malformed HTML.p  pInterestingly, the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryhtmlparser.html relnofollowHTMLParsera class in the Python Standard Lib does offer support for obtaining the location info with a codegetposcode method, but it is horrible at handling malformed HTML and has been eliminated as a possible solution. I need to parse HTML that exists in the real word without breaking the parser.p  pIm aware of two HTML parsers that would work well at parsing malformed HTML, namely a hrefhttplxml.de relnofollowlxmla and a hrefhttpcode.google.comphtml5lib relnofollowhtml5liba. And in fact, I would prefer to use either one of them over any other options available in Python.p  pHowever, as far as I can tell, html5lib offers no event API and would require that the document be parsed to a tree object. Then I would have to iterate through the tree. Of course, by that point, there is no association with the source document and all location information is lost. So, html5lib is out, which is a shame because it seems like the best parser for handling malformed HTML.p  pThe lxml library offers a Target API which mostly mirrors ElementTrees, but again, Im not aware of any way to access location information for each event. A glance at the source code offered no hints either.p  plxml also offers an API to SAX events. Interestingly, Pythons standard lib mentions that SAX has support for a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryxml.sax.reader.htmllocatorobjects relnofollowLocator Objectsa, but offers little documentation about how to use them. This a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15477363xmlsaxparserandlinenumbersetcSO Questiona provides some info when using a SAX Parser, but I dont see how that relates to the limited support for SAX events that lxml provides.p  pFinally, before anyone suggests a hrefhttpwww.crummy.comsoftwareBeautifulSoup relnofollowBeautiful Soupa, I will point out that, as stated on the home page, Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib.  All it gives me is an object to extract data from with no connection to the original source document. Like with html5lib, all location info is lost by the time I have access to the data. I wantneed raw access to the parser directly.p  pTo expand on the spell checker example I mention in the beginning, I would want to check the spelling only of words in the document text but not tag names or attributes and may want to skip checking the content of specific tags like the script or code tags. Therefore, I need a real HTML parser. However, I am only interested in the position of the misspelled words in the original source document when it comes to reporting the misspelled words and have no need to build a tree object. To be clear, this is only an example of one potential use. I may use it for something completely different but the needs would be essentially the same. In fact, I once built something very similar using HTMLParser, but never used it as the error handling wasnt going to work for that use case. That was years ago, and I seem to have lost that file somewhere along the line. Id like to use lxml or html5lib instead this time around.p  pSo, is there something Im missing I have a hard time believing that none of these parsers aside from the mostly useless HTMLParser have any way to access the position information. But if they do it must be undocumented, which seems strange to me.p

Negative 90 pIn my root project, I have many subprojectsp  ul licodecommoncodeli licodedependant1codeli licodedependant2codeli li...li licodestandalonecodeli ul  pIn this scenario, codecommoncode is a shared library. All other projects are dependant on it, with the exception of codestandalonecode. codestandalonecode is actually a standalone client JAR.p  pWhat I would like to do is get 5 classes from codecommoncode into the jar file produced in codestandalonecode. I only need those exact 5 classes out of 200 and want to avoid bringing codecommoncode as a full dependency along with all of codecommoncodes dependencies. Granted its an unusual setup, but I dont want to include classes that the client has no business with and the classes I am including just contain codeenumcode or codestatic finalcode.p  pSo far, I have tried the following in the codebuild.gradlecode for codestandalonecodep  precodejar      manifest.attributes          .... Removed           with projectcommon.jar          includecomclasspathClassA.class         includecomclasspathClassB.class         includecomclasspathClassC.class         includecomclasspathClassD.class         includecomclasspathClassE.class        codepre  pThis works very well for the codestandalonecode project, but tramples the other projects that were fully dependant on codecommoncode codecommon.jarcode will now only ever contain the classes listed above, regardless of which dependant project.p  pIm guessing this is expected behaviour in Gradles configuration phase, it sees the specific configuration I have for codecommoncode in codestandalonecode and applies that to codecommoncode.p  pSo, in short, what is the neatest solution to this Im thinking that I may need to provide a codeconfigurationcode in the codebuild.gradlecode for the codecommoncode project. Im not sure how to do this yet RTFM. I just wanted to check that there isnt a better approach to thisp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong to answer some of alexvetters questions.p  pI hadnt yet tried to include them from codebuildclassescode, but this did the trick see the accepted answer.p  pI did consider creating a new codecommonbasecode project. If there were much more than 5 classes that I needed, I absolutely would have gone this way. And yes, I only need the classes at runtime.p  pJust to clarify the last point... the codestandalonecode jar file is actually a JAXWS client jar that we provide to another team. The reason I needed to inlcude these specific classes in the client JAR is so that the client knows what values to give to certain web service method calls. Ideally, I would have replaced all of the included classes with codeenumcode like I mentioned, they are literally just codestatic finalcode definitions and JAXWS would have looked after everything. I actually did this to replace one of the class files that I was including. If I had done this for all the classes I needed to include, it would have triggered many more code changes for them why this was a problem is a whole different story p

Negative 90 pToday Im looking for some enlightenment of the deep magic inside the dynamic loader. Im debuggingtroubleshooting a plugin system for a C application running on Linux. It loads plugins via codedlopencode RTLDNOW  RTLSLOCAL and releases them using codedlclosecode. Nothing extraordinary  one would think.p  pHowever, I noticed that some plugins remain loaded even after codedlclosecode is successfully calledsupsup. I concluded this after looking at the running process memory map using a hrefhttplinux.die.netman1pmap relnofollowpmapa. Some libs get immediately removed from process memory and others keep lingering around apparently indefinitely.p  pContinuing on, the a hrefhttplinux.die.netman3dlopen relnofollowdlopen mana page statesp  blockquote   pThe function dlclose decrements the reference count on the dynamic   library handle handle. If the reference count drops to zero and no   other loaded libraries use symbols in it, then the dynamic library is   unloaded.p blockquote  pThat means the problem boils down to these two possibilities Either the reference counts arent zero, or other loaded libs are using symbols from some  but not all  of the plugins.p  pIm pretty sure although not 100 that the reference counts are zero. The applications plugin manager handles all plugins exactly the same. It also makes sure that a plugin doesnt get loaded multiple times. IMO loading amp unloading should therefore behave the same for all plugins. p  pThat leaves the second possibility other loaded libs are using symbols from the plugins. Another typical case of That should never happen. Although its certainly possible. Were using gcc and default visibility and as far as Ive seen nothing is stripped, so tons of symbols are being exported. Actually that worries me much more as these plugins should be independent. p  pHere then are my open questions at this pointp  ul liAre my conclusions so far correct li liDo you know a way to verifycodedlopencodes reference count li liIf there are internal symbols of my plugins accidentally used by other libs, is there a way to track down who is using which symbolsli ul  pMy machine is strongLinux 3.13.043generic 72Ubuntu SMP Mon Dec 8 193544 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i686 GNULinuxstrongp  psupsup I should mention that all of the loading and unloading happens in the main thread, so there should be no multi threading issue here.p

Negative 90 pAfter much groping in the dark, I think I may have uncovered an codeUbuntucode Desktop specific codedockercode issue.

I can also codetelnetcode to the codeMySQLcode server on port 3306 codeMySQLcode servers default port.li ul  pNow, I have a codeubuntulatestcode codedockercode container running on my laptop where neither of codemysqlcode or codetelnetcode commands to the said codeMySQLcode server work. I initially thought, this may be due to IP forwarding not enabled, so I uncommented line codenet.ipv4.ipforward1code in codeetcsysctl.confcode, but to no avail.p  pAlso, note that I do not encounter the same problem on codeUbuntucode server OS again, to reiterate, Im running codeUbuntucode Desktop OS on my laptop.p  pI do not encounter the same problems if I run the codedockercode container on a codeMaccode machine. So, clearly it is something specific to codeUbuntucode Desktop OS.p  pAlso, this cannot be related to codeMySQLcode privileges since I can connect to the codeMySQLcode server from my laptop.p  pWould anyone know why this is the casep  pThanks.p

Negative 90 pIm trying to recreate the Twitters HeaderView in my app.p  pThe final headerView should look and act like the one in the official Twitter app.p  pThe HeaderView which can be noticed in the official Twitter App. bra hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comshtqkuorxd7g4axztwitterscreenshots.jpgdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comshtqkuorxd7g4axztwitterscreenshots.jpgdl0ap  pAnd as most of you already know, if I were to use the Parallax technique used by Google in their Google Play app, the HeaderView would be overlapped by the other listviews views, which is not acceptable in my case.p  pSo, Ive managed to recreate the HeaderView which reacts to each listviews scroll event in the exact same way as Twitters one does. br br And heres how I did it brbr 1 I created a dummy headerView which has the exact same size as the desired HeaderView and then added it to the listview. brbr 2 I designed my desired headerView and put it in the layout xml file of my rootView right after the ListViews definition in order to achieve that overlapping effect. brbr 3 I extended the ListView class and added a little bit of my own logic in order to be able to calculate the approximate scrollY of the ListView and keep track of the dummy headerviews position. brbr 4 I added the listener for tracking of my dummy headerviews position in my main activity. And using that listener I was changing the position of my realoverlapping headerview according to the position changes of the dummy one.p  pAnd everything would be alright, if I didnt face the following problem br my real headerviewthe one that was defined in the rootViewslayout xml file has a few UI elements thatre supposed to be able to listen for the click events, and therefore all listeners are set.  brbr All the elements receive the click events nicely BUT when it comes to scrolling while holding the finger on one of these elements it doesnt work like its supposed to. brbr To make it more clear, in Twitter app, when you click on, for example, users profile picture and without releasing it you start moving your finger all over the screen the listview will react to it, and the listview will be scrolled, whereas in my case youre not gonna be able to do the sameyou can only click on a particular element and receive a response in the corresponding callback, and considering the fact that the TouchEven will be consumed it wont be forwarded to the underlying listview and the scroll will not be performed. That all is understood, but how does it work in the Twitter App thenp  pbrbr Ive even analyzed the Twitter Profile Activitys layoutthe layout where that fancy headerview can be found using ADM, and it seems like theyTwitter guys used basically the same trickthe trick with the dummy header view added to the listview and the real headerview added to the layout xml file, but how did they manage to perform the scrolling while holding the finder on one of the UI elementslike Profile Picture or Profile Background Picture Im just out of the smart ideas at this point.p  pbrbr Looking forward to your answers, any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 90 pThe top level object in my object hierarchy is a class called Song. It contains metadata about a song of the user, such as title, duration, lastPlayedDate. It also has a UIImage property that holds album artwork, and the audio data itself.p  pIm trying to use UIDocument to save my Song instances to disk, and possibly support iCloud later on. When the user is browsing his list of songs, ideally, the big images and audio data wouldnt be loaded yet  only the metadata that is needed to populate the list.p  pUIDocument supports NSFileWrapper which seems to help to achieve what I want. The idea seems to be to have a top level NSFileWrapper, representing the document file and multiple child NSFileWrappers inside, representing content filesp  precodeMySong.song   Metadata.data   AlbumArtwork.png   Thumbnail.png   Audio.mp3 codepre  pIm not exactly sure how I would separate my Song instace into different NSFileWrappers though.p  pMost tutorials and documentations seem to suggest to implement NSCoding in your top level model class. However, that would result in a single NSFileWrapper representing an entire Song, including metadata, artwork, audio.p  pOne possible solution I can think of is to make my top level model class be a UIDocument subclass. This way I can fine tune what gets saved and loaded when and where. Ive never seen this done though and it seems like bad practice mixing two classes with different responsibilities not sure. Or is this how its supposed to be done p  pAny other suggestions Thanksp

Negative 90 pHow do we allow a second client to authenticate users and access our api authorized backend Please correct any part of my understanding that is incorrect. p  pUser authentication is register  login  logout portion of your app.br App authorization for an api is confirming your app has permission to access an api.br A user should be logged in to the app and the app should be authorized in order for the user to access the api.  p  pIt is important to keep user authentication separate from app authorization because different clients apps may access our services through our api. Accordingly different users may have different access rights. p  pConsider a simple web app. Rails with devise is used in the app api client for user authentication. The app then accesses the railsapi using doorkeeper for app authorization.  p  pConsider then adding a simple mobile app. How would the mobile app access the same user authentication service How would we allow mobile app access to our user authorization servicep  pWould we need to separate the user authentication service into its own api using a separate instance of doorkeeper to authorize the mobile app and web app before creating users and then after authenticating users again authorize the app plus logged in user to access the backend api  p  pIm sure it should be easier than described. Any resources, books, videos also appreciated. p
Negative 90 pIm having a problem with image compression.

Negative 90 pOK, so Im a bit new to codeSwingWorkercode in Java.p  pIve built a Java GUI that, when the Start button is pressed, launches several codeSwingWorkercode threads. The first thread simply keeps track of run time and updates the GUI appropriately. The second one plays a series of sounds files.

Negative 90 pUnlike other MS applications like Notepad, the command prompt is no configured for full dictation. It can only understand individual letters and symbols through MS Speech recognition. Although that may be sufficient for short MS commands, it isnt satisfactory for console applications using the CLI where full dictation might be more useful than simply typing data in.p  pOne way I suppose this could be implemented is by using Microsofts SAPI to convert speech into text and then to read the output from a text file to make it appear that the CLI has understood full speech. But that seems very longwinded. Is there a quicker way to reconfigure the command prompts parameters to enable full dictation of entire words and not just charactersp

Negative 90 pRegards, the emcommitlogsyncperiodinmsem which is 10 seconds by default. Does it mean that Cassandra by default is configured to lose 10 seconds of data As the datapartition comes first to Memtable, ack is sent back to the client immediately, but the data in the Commitlog is flushed to the disk periodically every 10 seconds controlled by emcommitlogsyncperiodinmsem. So if anything happens during this period, 10 seconds of the data will be lostp
Negative 90 pI have generator function that creates a Cartesian product of lists.

Does an algorithmdata structure exist that could speed up this processp  pstrongEDITstrong Maybe this will clarify a little In the real application I am assembling random 2D pictures of buildings from simple basic blocks like pillars, roof segments, windows, etc.. The constraints limit what kind of blocks and their rotations can be grouped together, so the resulting random image looks realistic, and not a random jumble.p  pA given constraint can contain many combinations of patterns. But of all those combinations, many are not valid because a different constraint would prohibit some portion of it. So in my example, one constraint would contain the full Cartesian product of characters above. And a second constraint is the [ab].c this second constraint reduces the number of valid combinations of the first constraint that I need to consider.p  pBecause these constraints are difficult to create I looking to visualize what all the combinations of blocks in each constraint look like, but only the emvalidem combinations that pass all constraints. Hence my question. Thanksp

Negative 90 pI have a Google calendar for a store. The store has irregular hours that are subject to change, and therefore need to be displayed in real time.

Best to point out here my experience of Azure is approximately four hours...a complete noob.p  pThe original  and eventual  target database is SQL Server, and the databases are created using Entity Framework Code First. I was using DBCC CHECKIDENT to set the seed value for some identity columns, and then seeding the data, all in the database initializer.p  pAzure does not recognize DBCC CHECKIDENT, and having a look around this is a known issue.

Basically, If a user opens more than one web browsers tab, each tab will create a brand new serversent event request to the server which cause many requests to run from a single user.p  pTo solve this problem, I would like to run the SSE inside a Javascripts a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPISharedWorker relnofollowSharedWorkera.p  pThis means that I have only one SSE communicating with a SharedWorker. Then, every pageweb browser will communication with the SharedWorker. This gives me the advantage of only allowing one SSE per user.p  pThis is how my SSE working currently without any type of worker.p  precodefunction     connect to the server to read messages     window.loadfunction         startPolling new EventSourcepoll.php            function to listen for new messages from the server     function startPollingevtSource          evtSource.addEventListenergetMessagingQueue, functione              var data  JSON.parsee.data             handle recieved messages             processServerDatadata          , false          evtSource.onerror  functione              evtSource.close                 codepre  pI would like to have the same setup running. However, I would like to run it inside a javascripts SharedWorker to eliminate having more than one SSE per user.p  pI am struggling to implement the SharedWorker.

Negative 90 pI have a project that using Robolectric for unit test purpose. This project uses Robolectric 3.0 and need to add codeeacode and codenoverifycode options in Virtual Machine options. p  pIn Android Studio, I created new JUnit configuration in codeRun gt Edit Configurations...code and then set codeVM Optionscode to codeea noverifycode. With this way I success to run my unit test. This is image about my configure, view a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BwJHrbTmyE1sS2tMWXJmaFBkSEUviewuspsharing relnofollowHereap  pHowever, for continuous deployment, I need run unit test with command line. So I use code.gradlew testcode to run unit test. I also add codeorg.gradle.jvmargsea noverifycode to codegradle.propertiescode file. Unfortunately, it doesnt work. I can run unit test but I got codejava.lang.VerifyErrorcode and I think that codegradle.propertiescode was not load.p  pSo, my question is, how to make codegradle.propertiescode load or do you know any way to fix my vm options problemp

Negative 90 pIs it possible to create a systemwide global variable  semaphore  mutex in C on Linux p  pHeres the reason Ive got a system that often runs multiple copies of the same software on unrelated data. Its common to have 4 jobs, each running the same software. The software has a small section where it creates a huge graph that takes a lot of memory outside that section memory usage is moderate.p  pIt so happens sometimes that 2 jobs simultaneously hit the same memoryhungry section and the whole system starts swapping. Thus we want to prevent that by creating something like a strongcritical section mutex between different jobsstrong so that no more than one of them would allocate a lot of memory at a time.p  pIf these were thread of the same job pthread locks would do the job.p  pWhat would be a good way to implement such mutex between different jobsp

Negative 90 pI am doing a question on www.hackerrank.com and I have been stuck on it for days. p  pHere is the statement of the question a hrefhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesinsertionsort relnofollowhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesinsertionsorta. Basically, I have to count how many swaps occur in insertion sort for a given array in Onlogn time. p  pa hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637144 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637144a Here is my submitted code. I use merge sort and count how many times each element is displaced. This code passes for more than half of the sites tests. When it fails it doesnt time out, and it doesnt have a compilation error or segmentation fault. p  pFurthermore, when I got the input for one of the failed test cases Here is the input that it failed on the site a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637165 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637165a and tested it with this variation of my code a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637127 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637127a which actually runs the insertion sort algorithm counting the number of swaps along the way and checks it against the merge sort count, I pass all of the tests. Also, I have generated thousands of random test cases, and they also all pass using this test. p  pI dont think its a problem on the sites end because in the discussions for the problem other people seem to be passing the tests just fine without any questions or complaints. So maybe I am misunderstanding either the question or I am simply writing both the algorithm and the test cases for the algorithm wrong. Does anyone have any suggestionsp
