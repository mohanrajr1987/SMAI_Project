Negative 7130 pWhats the best way to stream files using ASP.NETp  pThere appear to be various methods for this, and Im currently using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary12s31dhyvvs.110.aspx relnofollowResponse.TransmitFilea method inside an http handler, which sends the file to the browser directly.  This is used for various things, including sending FLVs from outside the webroot to an embedded Flash video player.p  pHowever, this doesnt seem like a reliable method.  In particular, theres a strange problem with emInternet Explorer 7em, where the browser just hangs after a video or two are viewed.  Clicking on any links, etc have no effect, and the only way to get things working again on the site is to close down the browser and reopen it.p  pThis also occurs in other browsers, but much less frequently.  Based on some basic testing, I suspect this is something to do with the way files are being streamed... perhaps the connection isnt being closed properly, or something along those lines.p  pAfter trying a few different things, Ive found that the following method works for mep  precodeResponse.WriteFilepath Response.Flush Response.Close Response.End codepre  pThis gets around the problem mentioned above, and viewing videos no longer causes Internet Explorer to hang.p  pHowever, my understanding is that a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.httpresponse.writefilevvs.110.aspx relnofollowResponse.WriteFilea loads the file into memory first, and given that some files being streamed could potentially be quite large, this doesnt seem like an ideal solution.p  pIm interested in hearing how other developers are streaming large files in ASP.NET, and in particular, streaming FLV video files.p

Negative 7130 pI want to set the path for a TShellListView to display a directory of files using Delphi 2007.  I can initially use TShellListView.Root to set the root path like this and it shows the directory I wantp  precodeView  TShellListView.CreateSelf  ... View.Root  CWindows codepre  pBut if the user navigates away from that directory using backspace and I try to set the .Root back to the original directory, the directory displayed does not change.  It looks like .Root is meant to define the root of the shell namespace, not the current directory.p  pAlso, if the user navigates around using backspace, etc. the .Root property does not update to reflect the currently displayed path.  There is no .Path property like there is for TShellTreeView.p  pWhat I want is a way to get and set the current path as a string without being required to link the TShellListView to a TShellTreeView and set TShellTreeView.Path or hack ShellCtrls.pas since the relevant methods of TShellListView all look private.  I find it hard to believe there isnt a straightforward way to getset the path, so I assume Im missing something simple here, but this component is not documented at all.p

Negative 7130 pI have a database that I would like to leverage with codeZendSearchLucenecode. However, I am having difficulty creating a fully searchable document for Lucene.p  pEach codeZendSearchLucenecode document pulls information from two relational database tables codeTableOnecode and codeTableTwocode. codeTableOnecode has basic information codeidcode, codeowneridcode, codetitlecode, codedescriptioncode, codelocationcode, etc., codeTableTwocode has a 1N relationship to codeTableOnecode meaning, for each entry in codeTableOnecode, there could be one or more entries in codeTableTwocode. TableTwo contains id, codelistingidcode, codebedroomscode, codebathroomscode, codepricemincode, codepricemaxcode, codedateavailablecode. See Figure 1. p  pFigure 1p  precodeTableOne     id Primary Key     ownerid     title     description     location     etc...

Negative 7130 pRecently, our big project began crashing on unhandled division by zero. No recent code seems to contain any likely elements so it may be new data sets affecting old code. The problem is the code base is pretty big, and running on an embedded device with no comfortable debug access debug is done by a lot of printfs over serial console, there is no gdb for the device and even if there was, the binary compiled with debug symbols wouldnt fit.p  pThe most viable way would likely be to find all the division operations they are relatively infrequent, and analyze code surrounding each of them to see if any of the divisor variables was left unguarded. p  pThe question is then either how to find all division operations in a big 200 files, some big C project, or, if you have a better idea how to locate the error, please give them.p  pextra info project runs on embedded ARM9, a small custom Linux distro, crosscompiled with CygwinWindows crosstools, IDE is Eclipse but theres also Cygwin with all the respective goodies.

However, when the request are made in quick successions, some of the AJAX calls do not get registered, or the onCreate and onComplete actions get kicked off at the same time, and more often than not, the busy spinner continues to appear on the screen, after all the calls have successfully completed. Is there any check I can perform at the end of the call, to check if the element is visible, I can hide it. p  precodedocument.observedomloaded, function  loading.hide  Ajax.Responders.register When an Ajax call is made.  onCreate function  new Effect.toggleloading, appear new Effect.Opacitydisplayarea,  from 1.0, to 0.3, duration 0.7  ,  onComplete function  new Effect.toggleloading, appear new Effect.Opacitydisplayarea,  from 0.3, to 1, duration 0.7     codepre  pThanksp
Negative 7130 pthe problem i have is that i have multiple nested master pagesp  ul listronglevel 1strong global header, footer, login, navigation, etc...   li listronglevel 2strong specific search pages, account pages, etc...li listronglevel 3strong the page itselfli ul  pnow, since only one form can have coderunatservercode, i put the form at global page so i can handle things like login, feedback, etc....p  pnow with this solution id have to also put the for example level 3 see above methods, such as search also on the level 1 master page, but this will lead to this page being heavy for development with code from all places, even those that are used on a single page only change email form for example.p  pis there any way to delegate such methods from the codeonclickcode events for example codeChangeEMailcode from level 1 global masterpage to level 3 the single page itself.p  pto be even more clear i want to NOT have to have the method codeChangeEMailcode on the global master page code behind, but would like to MOVE it somehow to the only page that will actually use it. the reason why it currently has to be on the global master is that global master has codeform runatservercode and there can be only one of those per aspx page.p  pthis way it will be easier more logical to structure the code.p  pthnx hope i explained it correctlyp  pemhave searched but did not find any general info on handling this case, usualy the answer is have all the methods on the master page, but i dont like it. so ANY way of moving it to the specific page would be awesome. thnxemp  pstrongeditstrong also part of the same thing... on the other hand  how to access the codetextbox1.textcode for example on the content page from master page any best practice for thisp

For example, we are going to be featured on a television show, and I expect in the hour after the show, Ill get more than 100 times more traffic than normal.p  pMy understanding is that MySQL InnoDB generally keeps my data in a bunch of different placesp  ul liRAM Buffersli licommitlogli libinary logli liactual tablesli liAll of the above places on my DB slaveli ul  pThis is too much durability given that Im on an EC2 node and most of the stuff goes across the same network pipe file systems are network attached.

The data is not high value and Id rather take a small chance of a few minutes of data loss rather than have a high probability of an outage when the crowd arrives.p  pDuring these traffic bursts I would like to do all of that IO emonlyem if I can afford it. Id like to just keep as much in RAM as possible I have a fair chunk of RAM compared to the data size that would be touched over an hour. If buffers get scarce, or the IO channel is not too overloaded, then sure, Id like things to go to the commitlog or binary log to be sent to the slave. If, and only if, the IO channel is not overloaded, Id like to write back to the actual tables.p  pIn other words, Id like MySQLInnoDB to use a write back cache algorithm rather than a write through cache algorithm. Can I convince it to do thatp  pIf this is not possible, I am interested in general MySQL writeperformance optimization tips. Most of the docs are about optimizing read performance, but when I get a crowd of users, I am creating accounts for all of them, so thats a writeheavy workload.p

Negative 7130 pIm trying to secure my application by running the bits of code that deal with userprovided content under a very restrictive SecurityManager.  Its AccessController.doPrivileged turned on its head  normally this is used to provide a block of code with extra permissions but Im using it to constrain a block of code to a very small sandbox.p  pEverything is fine until I need to call a constructor. Then I need readaccess to the world.  Or at least to all of the .jar, .class and .property files on my classpath.  I cant just grant read access to lt since thats what Im trying to avoid.  E.g., an XEE attack that tries to read etcpasswd.  I dont think that would be enough anyway.p  pI can move some of the constructors out of the SecurityManager block, but some are unavoidable since its a SAX parser that needs to create objects as it goes through the tree.p  pIdeasp
Negative 7130 pWhen using the Ecommerce methods in Google Analytics do you also make calls to the normal tracking methods as wellp  pWhen we first added GA too our site a few years ago we left it off of the sales pages as we wanted to be careful about what information might be sent to Google. But now that Im adding Ecommerce tracking to these pages Im wondering if GA would benefit from also getting normal tracking data on the sales pages.p  pMy guess is that as long as Im not doing something stupid like passing personal data as GET parameters then it is safe to put GA on a page that handles credit card informationp  pI could just leave it alone and only make the Ecommerce calls to GA but Im worried that I wont get as much benefit from GA if it doesnt have the full context of the transaction from normal tracking calls.p  pAny general experience with using GA on a page that handles credit card information would be helpful.p

Likewise, I dont know to pass the AlphaTab class delegate to the function, which I think would solve the problem.p  pIm ought to think, that the problem could be created from this line aswellp  precodeFILE Parser.h   protocol AlphaTab ltUITableViewDelegategt  voidparsedInformationNSArray i end codepre  pIve done some research about protocols and respondsToSelector, but honestly, I didnt understand much, since my code is seen from the programmatic perspective of view, without using the InterfaceBuilder at all, since Ive been adviced to do that. It hasnt lead to the solution of the problem either.p  pFor further understanding, I then want this function in AlphaTab.m to be called, when the information is parsed.p  precodeFILE AlphaTab.m    voidparsedInformationNSArray i    NSLogThe parser has completed parsing    information  i   NSLogThis is the information d, [[information objectAtIndex0] objectForKeytabTitle]     [self.tableView reloadData]       codepre  pIve looked on the net, and I found some explications about the NSInternalInconsistencyException. Ive tried to do them as well, for example by setting everybody with themselves as delegates. However, I had no luck. What wonders me most, is that when I use the Parser without having to subclass its caller this case AlphaTab to a main class, it works like a charm.p  pI hope you guys can give me a clue. If you need any more information please ask, and Ill be in disposition. p  pBrinck10p

Negative 7130 pI cant figure out how to implement this in a performing way, so I decided to ask you guys.p  pI have a list of rectangles  actually atm only squares, but I might have to migrate to rectangles later, so lets stick to them and keep it a bit more general  in a 2 dimensional space. Each rectangle is specified by two points, rectangles can overlap and I dont care all too much about setup time, because the rectangles are basicly static and theres some room for precalculate any setup stuff like building trees, sorting, precalculating additional vectors, whatever etc. Oh I am developing in JavaScript if this is of any concern.p  pTo my actual question given a point, how do I get a set of all rectangles that include that point  p  pLinear approaches do not perform well enough. So I look for something that performs better than On. I read some stuff, like on Bounding Volume Hierarchies and similar things, but whatever I tried the fact that rectangles can overlap and I actually want to get all of them, if the point lies within multiple rectangles seems to always get into my way.p  pAre there any suggestions Have I missed something obvious Are BVH even applicable to possibly overlapping bounds If so, how do I build such a possibly overlapping tree If not, what else could I use It is of no concern to me if borders are inside, outside or not determined.p  pIf someone could come up with anything helpfull like a link or a rant on how stupid I am to use BVH and not SomeSuperCoolStructurePerfectlySuitedForMyProblem Id really appreciate itp  pstrongEditstrong Ok, I played around a bit with RTrees and this is exactly what I was looking for. Infact I am currently using the RTree implementation a hrefhttpstackulator.comrtree relnofollowhttpstackulator.comrtreea as suggested by endyc.

Negative 7130 pI am using Oracle PLSQL on Oracle Database 10gp  pI use SYS.DBSJOB to set a job to send an email.

Negative 7130 pNeed a little help please if anyone can shed some light on this.p  pIve created a codefirst MVC 3 application which I have working fine.  Im refactoring now to remove as much coupling as possible as I want the domain model to be used in various other MVC 3 applications later on.  What I have now is a collection of entities which are persisted via a normalised database and they are CRUDed through a repository pattern.  I have used Ninject to DI the repositories via the controllers constructor and am using models within the MVC 3 project to act as DAOs.p  pSo, within the domain I have an entity called strongCasestrong that has a foreign key to another case strongClientstrong that looks like thisp  precodepublic class Case  ICase      [Key]     public int CaseId  get set      public string CaseName  get set      public DateTime DateCreated  get set      public IClient Client  get set   codepre  pThen I have an interface the interface exists mainly to implement it to the view model to add my data annotations  I know I could add the annotations to the domain object but as I said I want to use this domain model in other applications which will have a different ubiquitious language.p  precodepublic interface ICase      int CaseId  get set      string CaseName  get set      DateTime DateCreated  get set      IClient Client  get set   codepre  pAnd then I have my view model within the MVC 3 project.p  precodepublic class CaseModel  ICase      [HiddenInputDisplayValue  false]     int CaseId  get set       [RequiredAllowEmptyStrings  false]     [MaxLength100]     string CaseName  get set       [RegularExpression]     DateTime DateCreated  get set           IClient Client  get set       codepre  pSo, my first problem is this changing my foreign key reference for strongClientstrong to strongIClientstrong is a new thing, and it returns a null object.  When the type was a concrete class it returned fine  I assume this is because EF4.1 tries to create an instance of strongIClientstrong.  Am I totally wrong here or is there a way around thisp  pMy second problem which may negate my first problem is am I also doing something wrong by adding data annotations to a view model inheriting the interface of my domain entity  Should I be using model meta data  If so, how do I use meta data in such a way that I can make the data annotations unique to each project without touching the domainp  pThanksp

Then, down below we specify     a fixed left position for the corresponding submenus e.g. productssubmenu, etc.     Using these fixed values isnt as elegant as just letting the text of each     menu title determine the width of the menu titles and position of the submenus,     but we found this hardwired approach resulted in fewer crossbrowsercrossOS     formatting glitches  and its pretty easy to adjust these title widths and the     corresponding submenu left positions below, just by eyeballing them whenever     we need to change the navbar menu titles which isnt often.   .submenu      positionabsolute   zindex 2   top 23px  corresponds to lineheight of a.navbartitle above    padding 0 margin 0     width166px  If adjust this, then adjust width of .submenu below a too      color white     backgroundcolor  666633     border 1px solid 447755  box around entire submenu    fontfamily Verdana, Arial, Geneva,  Helvetica, sansserif     fontsize 11px   Fix IE formatting quirks.   html .submenu  width 148px   IE needs narrower than width of .submenu above   End    position of each sub menu   We just eyeball the position of each submenu here  can move left or right as needed.

Using the visibility property instead     of using the display property avoided a bug in some versions of Safari.     The bug is pretty where esoteric The browser ignored the hover property     on li objects inside an object whose display property was set to none     when the page loaded... Using the visibility property instead of display     would normaly take up extra room on the page, but thats avoided here by putting     the submenu on a second layer see position absolute and zindex 2     in .submenu definition, higher up this page.   .submenu a    display block   color eee   backgroundcolor 666633   width 146px  This should be width of .submenu above minus rightside padding on next line    padding 5px 0px 4px 20px   textdecoration none   backgroundcolor 666633   borderbottom 447755 dotted 1px   bordertop 0 borderleft 0 borderright 0    ul  position relative display block  li  position relative display block   .submenubox    margin 0 padding 0 border 0  .submenubox ul    margin 0 padding 0 border 0   liststyletype none   .submenubox ul li    margin 0 padding 0 border 0   .submenubox ul li alink   .submenubox ul li avisited   .submenubox ul li ahover    color c6e8e2  text color for submenu items    backgroundcolor 447755   borderbottom 447755 dotted 1px    ltstylegt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  JavaScript functions to show and hide dropdown menus.

Negative 7130 pFor the classic interview question How do you perform integer multiplication without the multiplication operator, the easiest answer is, of course, the following lineartime algorithm in Cp  precodeint multint multiplicand, int multiplier      for int i  1 i lt multiplier i              multiplicand  multiplicand           return multiplicand  codepre  pOf course, there is a faster algorithm. If we take advantage of the property that bit shifting to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2 to the power of the number of bits shifted, we can bitshift up to the nearest power of 2, and use our previous algorithm to add up from there. So, our code would now look something like thisp  precodeinclude ltmath.hgt  int log2 double n       return logn  log2   int multint multiplicand, int multiplier      int nearestpower  2  floorlog2multiplier     multiplicand ltlt nearestpower     for int i  nearestpower i lt multiplier i              multiplicand  multiplicand           return multiplicand  codepre  pIm having trouble determining what the time complexity of this algorithm is.

Negative 7130 pIm struggling with the proper organisation of a MVC Controller for my validation of a multipaged form.

Negative 7130 pI have an application that uses several different databases to collect similar information.  I do this through an ODBC interface, which effectively abstracts my persistence layer from my application layer, and it works fairly well.p  pHeres the thing I want to have a bit more specific queries than p  precodeSELECT  FROM [TableName] codepre  pAs far as I can tell, this works for all ODBC databases, but when you start to get a little more specific, syntax and language usage become more problematic.  The query that will work in MySQL will not necessarily work in MSSQL the query that runs fine against Oracle will not fare so well against PostgreSQL.p  pBut ODBC is an abstraction layer, so Im thinking there must be a language reference that all ODBCcompliant database systems support.  If I write my queries using those language constructs, I should expect to get similar results back, regardless of the database system.p  pAm I right  Is there such a standard  If so, where can I find the language reference so I can write my queries accordingly  Things Im interested in in particular are constructs likep  ul liTOP LIMIT li liMID SUBSTR li liCAST CONVERTli ul  petc.  Thanks for your helpp

Negative 7130 pI have been looking for the clear meaning of memory addresses 461h Cursor Start and 460h Cursor End in the BIOS Data Area.p  pBut I have just found some references that say that it is the size of the cursor. Others say that they refer to scan lines, and the used values also differ broadly 63h and 00h for MCGA 67h and 00 for 80x25 text mode or 01h and 00h for instance but it is still not specific enough, and it seems that it is necessary to adjust those values if the VGA registers are programmed manually for a standard graphics or text mode more specifically text modes, which actually use a cursor instead of using INT 10h, so that DOS or the BIOS itself can keep a consistent configuration.p  pI have seen the first 2 pages of Google results Ralf Brown, mcamafia.de, Wikipedia, TinyVGA, BIOS Central, etc. but the information they contain doesnt allow me to describe precisely what those values do, or to which configuration they correspond in the VGA registers, so I would be programming those values blindly.p  pstrongSo what would be the right definition for themstrongp

I am actually working on a Wordpress admin panel, full of various options the user can set. Each option is set through a variable containing a multidimensional array, like this only much largerp  precodeoptions  array  array   id gt optionid,  The name of the input field   type gt text,  Input type   value gt some value here  Input value    codepre  pWhen the user saves the options, a function fires, creating an array out of all the various input values and saving them into the database. Like below, although highly stripped downp  precodeforeach  options as o    if  isset POST[ o[ id ] ]      settings[ o[ id ] ]  POST[ o[ id ] ]    codepre  pSome of the options from the multidimensions options variable, are to be saved as a part of an array, instead of a string. These options contain square brackets in their IDs, like optionid[value1].p  pThis is where things get complicated. Currently, I am having to send the ID through a function that checks for the square brackets [], then telling the save function what to do with it appropriately save as an array or string.p  pThis is why the eval solution is ideal. It allows me to create a variable thats already an array and contains the index, without having to use other functions to disect the ID. It severely reduces a long winded process, or so I believe.p  pSo in essence, is there a safer, similar way I can go about using eval, or using alternative functionality. What are the dangers of using eval in the way above Can malicious code be executed in the context used above Surely executing code before a  would cause PHP errorsp

Negative 7130 pI am inserting several 10k records into a database with REF integrity rules. Some of the rows of data are unfortunately duplicates in that they already exist in the database. It would be too expensive to check the existence of every row in the database before inserting it so I intend to proceed by handling IntegrityError exceptions thrown by SQLAlchemy, logging the error and then continuing.p  pMy code will look something like thisp  precode establish connection to db etc.  tbl  obtainbindingtosqlalchemyorm datarows  loadrowstoimport  try     conn.executetbl.insert, datarows except IntegrityError as ie      eat error and keep going except Exception as e      do something else codepre  pThe implicit assumption I am making above is that SQLAlchemy is not rolling the multiple inserts into ONE transaction. If my assumption is wrong then it means that if an IntegrityError occurs, the rest of the insert is aborted. Can anyone confirm if the pseudocode pattern above will work as expected  or will I end up losing data as a result of thrown IntegrityError exceptionsp  pAlso, if anyone has a better idea of doing this, I will be interested to hear it.p

Negative 7130 pIn a game I am working on, one class has the job of drawing a sprite while another class has the job of manipulating the coordinates i.e if the sprite is about to go off of the screen, stop it there. Yes, I know this is vector graphics. Anyway, I need the coordinates to be shared between both classes.

Negative 7130 pI wonder, what is the fastest way to accomplish this kind of task in PostgreSQL. I am interested in the fastest solutions ever possible.p  pI found myself such kind of solution for MySQL, it performs much faster than just truncation of tables one by one. But anyway, I am interested in the fastest solutions for MySQL too. See my result here, of course it it for MySQL only a hrefhttpsgithub.combmabeydatabasecleanerissues126 relnofollowhttpsgithub.combmabeydatabasecleanerissues126ap  pI have following assumptionsp  precodeI have 30100 tables. Let them be 30.  Half of the tables are empty.  Each nonempty table has, say, no more than 100 rows. By this I mean, tables are NOT large.  I need an optional possibility to exclude 2 or 5 or N tables from this procedure.  I cannot use transactions. codepre  pI need the fastest cleaning strategy for such case working on PostgreSQL both 8 and 9.p  pI see the following approachesp  p1 Truncate each table. It is too slow, I think, especially for empty tables.p  p2 Check each table for emptiness by more faster method, and then if it is empty, reset its unique identifier column analog of AUTOINCREMENT in MySQL to initial state 1, i.e to restore its lastvalue from sequence back to 1, otherwise run truncate on it.p  pI use Ruby code to iterate through all tables, calling code below on each of them, I tried to setup SQL code running against each table likep  precodeDO DECLARE r record BEGIN   somehowcaptured  SELECT lastvalue from tableidseq   IF somehowcaptured  1 THEN      restore initial unique identifier column value here    END    IF somehowcaptured gt 1 THEN     TRUNCATE TABLE table   END IF END codepre  pManipulating this code in various aspects, I couldnt make it work, because of I am unfamiliar with PostgreSQL functions and blocks and variables.p  pAlso my guess was that EXISTSSELECT something FROM TABLE could somehow be used to work good as one of the check procedure units, cleaning procedure should consist of, but havent accomplished it too.p  pI would appreciate any hints on how this procedure could be accomplished in PostgreSQL native way.p  pUPDATEp  pI need all this to run unit and integration tests for Ruby or Ruby on Rails projects. Each test should have a clean DB before it runs, or to do a cleanup after itself so called teardown. Transactions are very good, but they become unusable when running tests against particular webdrivers, in my case the switch to truncation strategy is needed. Once I updated that with reference to RoR, please do not post here the answers about Obviously, you need DatabaseCleaner for PG and so on and so on.p  pUPDATE 2p  pThe strategy described here recently was merged into DatabaseCleaner, a hrefhttpsgithub.combmabeydatabasecleaner relnofollowhttpsgithub.combmabeydatabasecleanera as precount option see README there.p

No problem so far.p  pId like to do this a different way if possible.  Rather than having the sdf file copied out when the program first runs, Id like to set it up so that when the user saves their database, THEN it copies out the sdf file using the name of their choosing and saves their dataset to it.p  pI have read ways to write out the file as binary, which does work but it takes several lines of code that just seems unnecessary.  Isnt there a way just to tell the program hey, go ahead and copy this sdf file out real quick  After all, the program is able to automatically do it when you first run it.p

Negative 7130 pI need to be able to identify a user in my RESTful service. I decided to use HTTPS with client certificate authentication, so it will allow other services to pass user or passwords in URL, header or whatever way safely.p  pNow I want to encrypt some data being sent back to a service. For instance, instead of sending plain user ID  just encrypt it with my own server key and send back. Then the service will send this encrypted data, and I will be able to decrypt it locally. p  pTo to this encryption I would like to use SSL certificate presented to me by the service.p  pI guess that the certificate, which is located on my server, contains both private and public keys. So I could use my serverside certificates public key to encrypt the data and be sure that I can safely decrypt it with private key on serverside. The thirdparty service wont be able to decrypt the data because it will have only public key of my serverside certificate.p  pNow the question  given client SSL certificate in format of X509Certificate from client HTTPS, how do I find out corresponding certificates in my local keystore What will be the format of that certificate and how to get private  public key from itp  pstrongUPDstrong the basic flowp  ul liservice sends request to REST app a hrefhttprest.api.comauthenticateusernamepassword relnofollowhttprest.api.comauthenticateusernamepasswordali liREST app sends back response  ok 123456 li liservice sends request to REST app a hrefhttprest.api.com1233456dosomething relnofollowhttprest.api.com1233456dosomethingali liREST app extracts 123456 and knows which user has to be used for the operationli ul  pwhat I want to getp  ul liservice sends request to REST app a hrefhttprest.api.comauthenticateusernamepassword relnofollowhttprest.api.comauthenticateusernamepasswordali liREST app takes usernamepassword and find out user ID in databaseli liREST app doesnt want to share the ID with the serviceli liREST app knows about SSL certificate of serviceli liREST app finds out the corresponding public key, used to encrypt incoming traffic to that serviceli liREST app encrypts the id 123456 with REST app public key and sends response   ok  lybibHubJis7  li liservice sends request to REST app a hrefhttprest.api.comlybibHubJis7dosomething relnofollowhttprest.api.comlybibHubJis7dosomethingali liREST app decrypts string lybibHubJis7 using private key of SSL keychain, and finds out that user ID is 123456, then performs operation with this user.li ul

The two should be isolated  if you go to codemagentogearlockercode, you shouldnt interact with the generic store at codemagentocode at all.p  pHeres the problem the stores base URL is set explicitly to a hrefhttpwww.seacadetshipsstore.commagentogearlocker relnofollowhttpwww.seacadetshipsstore.commagentogearlockera. When users navigate to a hrefhttpseacadetshipsstore.commagentogearlocker relnofollowhttpseacadetshipsstore.commagentogearlockera no www, they get redirected to a hrefhttpwww.seacadetshipsstore.commagento relnofollowhttpwww.seacadetshipsstore.commagentoa.p  pMy question is this if a user navigates to the gearlocker site without www, is there a way to set a second store URL to prevent a redirect Or would it be easier to control that redirect back to codemagentogearlockercode, instead of codemagentocode Any thoughts, solutions, or references would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

It should read all the files two different extensions in the folder and match the file names for similarity but of different extensions. Each file has a very similar file but with the other extension. So, two matched file names should be available in two variables that can passed on to the subsequent operation commands. Thanksp

Negative 7130 pCould you please help me with my struggle to startbuild my first hello world application for android I am using ubuntu as my operating system. I downloaded android sdk as well as Intellij. I added libraries. I handled error connected to missing android.app by mentioned previously libraries. Unfortunately I met another issue with the following messagep  blockquote   pInformationCompilation completed with 33 errors and 0 warnings in 9   sec Information33 errors Information0 warnings  trouble processing   javaxcryptoExemptionMechanismSpi.class  p      pIlladvised or mistaken usage of a core class java. or javax.    when not building a core library.  This is often due to inadvertently   including a core library file  in your applications project, when   using an IDE such as  Eclipse. If you are sure youre not   intentionally defining a  core class, then this is the most likely   explanation of whats  going on.  However, you might actually be   trying to define a class in a core  namespace, the source of which you   may have taken, for example,  from a nonAndroid virtual machine   project. This will most  assuredly not work. At a minimum, it   jeopardizes the  compatibility of your app with future versions of the   platform.   It is also often of questionable legality.  If you really   intend to build a core library  which is only  appropriate as part   of creating a full virtual machine  distribution, as opposed to   compiling an application  then use  the corelibrary option to   suppress this error message.   If you go ahead and use   corelibrary but are in fact  building an application, then be   forewarned that your application  will still fail to build or run, at   some point. Please be  prepared for angry customers who find, for   example, that your  application ceases to function once they upgrade   their operating  system. You will be to blame for this problem.  If   you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a  core   package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to  repackage   that code.  That is, move the classes in question into  your own   package namespace. This means that they will never be in  conflict   with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help  you in this   endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then  that is an   indication that the path you are on will ultimately  lead to pain,   suffering, grief, and lamentation. p      p1 error abortingp blockquote  pWhat do I do wrongp

Negative 7130 pMy application is derived from a Windows Phone 8 Direct3D Xaml sample, where a C program instantiates a WinPRT component that contains a Direct3D device. The C code runs on the UI thread and the component code runs on a separate application thread. The WinPRT component works with a C precompiled library that contains variables declared perthread, strongstatic declspecthreadstrong.p  pThe variables get initialized when needed in the application thread, but the shutdown caused by the lifecycle Closing event is called on the UI thread. The shutdown process uses the wrong set of perthread variables which havent been initialized and causes a crash. p  pI havent found any method on the WinPRT component that gets called on the application thread during shutdown. I was hoping to find one to hook my stuff into but there doesnt seem to be any.p  pSo, how do I call the shutdown code to be run on the application thread from the UI thread p  pWinPRT severely limits the threading functionality available to me. I havent been able to find a workable solution. I looked at the Dispatcher class, but on WinPRT its only used to run code on the UI thread from a worker thread and not vice versa.

Negative 7130 pSorry for the lengthy explanation... I like to be thorough.p  pI am very new to OOP PHP about a week of coding in it so far but I have caught on pretty well and I really like it  I had placed all of my classes into one GIANT include file and I was including it in every page that needed an object that was being stored in the codeSESSIONcode.  Then today I realized that this was difficult to navigate and that every page was loading every class even if it didnt use it so when I read somewhere that it was best to break classes out into their own files I put all of them in their own files inside a lib folder.p  pThe student class went in the student.php file. the staff class went into the staff.php file. etc. etc.p  pHere is where I get confused... I programed a few factories for looking up certain information from a database.  These factories work great  I pass the type such as ID, username, asset and the factory returns the appropriate lookup which then can be passed the criteria.p  pHere is an example of what I did for one factory.

Negative 7130 pI am working an Mac OS version of an existing  iOS App. The iOS App uses iCloud to share its data accross devices. Of  course this data should be accessable from the Mac OS version as well.  When implementing the iCloud functionality in the iOS App the Stanford  videos have been a great help. The iOS App uses a UIManagedDocument to  setup the Core Data stack and handle all the iCloud related stuff.p  pUnfurtunatly  there is no UIManagedDocument class for Mac OS wich does the same  thing. NSPersistantDocument integrates the Core Data framework but is  not designed to work with iCloud. Thus I am not sure how I can  accessuse the UIManagedDocument data in iCloud from within the Mac OS  App.p  pAccess to iCloud from within the Mac OS App is no  problem. After using URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier I can access  the iCloud Folder and see all data wich is stored there. But seeing  and using the data are two different things.p  pIs there any example that demonstrates to how use iCloud from iOS AND Mac OSp  pThank you very muchep

Negative 7130 pI want to insert rows with a MERGE statement in a specified order to avoid deadlocks. Deadlocks could otherwise happen because multiple transaction will call this statement with overlapping sets of keys. Note that this code is also sensitive to duplicate value exception but I handle that by retrying so that is not my question. I was doing the followingp  precodeMERGE INTO targetTable USING  SELECT ... FROM sourceCollection ORDER BY ltdesiredUpdateOrdergt  WHEN MATCHED THEN  UPDATE ... WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT ... codepre  pNow Im still getting the dead lock so Im becoming unsure whether oracle maintains the order of the subquery. Does anyone know how to best make sure that oracle locks the rows in targetTable in the same order in this case Do I have to do a SELECT FOR UPDATE before the merge In which order does the SELECT FOR UPDATE lock the rows Oracle UPDATE statement has an ORDER BY clause that MERGE seems to be missing. Is there another way to avoid dead locks other than locking the rows in the same order every timep  p[Edit] This query is used to maintain a count of how often a certain action has taken place. When the action happens the first time a row is inserted, when it happens a second time the count column is incremented. There are millions of different actions and they happen very often. A table lock wouldnt work.p

Negative 7130 pI would like to use an AlarmManager to call a specific method within a class that is ALREADY being called periodically by another AlarmManager.

Now I have a strongservices.pystrong that has a bunch of functions for things like checking if certain users or groups exist, checking if a user is a member of a particular group, etc. I use these services in an api route which is sent JSON in a request and uses it to add transactions to the db, something similar to thisp  pstrongroutes.pystrongp  precodeimport services  app.routeaddtrans def addtrans      get the values out of the json in the request     args  request.getjson     groupid  args[groupid]     fromid  args[from]     toid  args[to]      amount  args[amount]       check that both users exist     if not services.userexiststoid or not services.userexistsfromid         return no such users       check that the group exists     if not services.groupexiststoid         return no such group       add the transaction to the db     services.addtransactionfromid,toid,groupid,amount     return success codepre  pThe problem comes when I try to mock out these services for testing.

Negative 7130 pstrongThe examplestrongp  pTable A  has the fields Person and DateTime. Id like to query the data of a person after a date time.

I couldnt really find good information about in the internet. Would you consider following statement as a general true rule, or does it depend..., and on whatp  pWhen there are different columns which have more or less diverse values, and we read data with a statement that uses all columns with sense in the index, then it is the best for read performancep  ul liIf an index has one field, then choose the column which has the most diverse values.li liIf an index has multiple fields, then choose the columns in the order from the least diverse to the most diverse.li ul  pWhen I imagine an index organising the pointers in a tree, where each node has two descendants, then the above statement seems logical to me, not I would be as well interested in links about how an index structure is built, used or knowledge about what engines use which types since i feel that has an influence on the statement above...or not Thank youp

Negative 7130 pI am trying to generate code coverage for the project I am currently working on. The project is several years old and we just recently started writing unit tests, meaning that I only want to generate coverage for the files we have actual unit tests for.

Negative 7130 pI have been reading articles describing how space complexity of quicksort can be reduced by using the tail recursive version but I am not able to understand how this is so. Following are the two versions p  precodeQUICKSORTA, p, r        q  PARTITIONA, p, r        QUICKSORTA, p, q1        QUICKSORTA, q1, r   TAILRECURSIVEQUICKSORTA, p, r    while p lt r       q  PARTITIONA, p, r       TAILRECURSIVEQUICKSORTA, p, q1       p  q1 codepre  pSource  a hrefhttpmypathtothe4.blogspot.com201302lesson2variationsonquicksorttail.htmlhttpmypathtothe4.blogspot.com201302lesson2variationsonquicksorttail.htmlap  pAs far as I understand , both of these would cause recursive calls on both the left and right half of the array. In both the cases , only one half would processed at a time and therefore at any time only one recursive call would be using the stack space. I am unable to see how the tail recursive quicksort saves space.p  pThe pseudo code above is taken from the article  a hrefhttpmypathtothe4.blogspot.com201302lesson2variationsonquicksorttail.htmlhttpmypathtothe4.blogspot.com201302lesson2variationsonquicksorttail.htmla The explanation provided in the article confuses me even more  p  blockquote   pQuicksort partitions a given subarray and proceeds to recurse twice   one on the leftsubarray and one on the right. Each of these   recursive calls will require its own individual stream of stack space.   This space is used to store the indexing variables for the array at   some level of recursion. If we picture this occurring from beginning   to end of execution, we can see that the stack space doubles at each   layer.p      pSo how does TailRecursiveQuicksort fix all of thisp      pWell, instead of recursing on two subarrays, we now only recurse on   one. This eliminates the need for doubling stack space at every layer   of execution. We get around this problem by using the while loop as an   iterative control that performs the same task. Instead of needing the   stack to save sets of variables for two recursive calls, we simply   alter the same set of variables and use the single recursive call on   new variables.p blockquote  pI dont see how the stack space doubles at every layer of execution in the case of a regular quicksort. p  pNote  There is no mention of compiler optimization in the article.p

Negative 7130 pI have a data file where decimal points arent specified for a decimal number. The number is just described in the layout for the data file as first 2 digits as real and next 2 digits as decimal and it varies for different fields, the real and decimal partp  pSo an actual number 12345.6789 is specified as 123456789. When I want this to be rounded off to 2 decimal points to match the value in application, I use the below logicp  precodePublic Function RoundingNumberValue, DecimalPoints, RoundOff          Rounder Roundoff1     Difference  DecimalPoints  Rounder     NumberValue  MidNumberValue, 1, LenNumberValueDifference      RealNumberMidNumberValue,1,LenNumberValueRounder     DecimalNumberRightNumberValue,Rounder      NumberValue  RealNumberamp.ampDecimalNumber     NumberValue  CdblNumberValue     NumberValue  RoundNumberValue, Roundoff     Rounding  FormatNumberNumberValue,Difference1,,,0  End Function codepre  pHowever the problem with this logic is that I am not able to round off decimals when the number has 0 as the decimal valuep  pFor an Example, lets take 12345.0000 which I want to round off to 2 decimal pointsp  pMy function returns it as 12345 whereas I want this to be returned as 12345.00p  pAny ideas on how this logic could be tweaked to get the desired output or is that not possible at allp

Here is the function I am trying to use.p  precodevalues  [tens, 10, fives, 5, ones, 1, tenths, 0.1]  def getdigitsnum     num  intnum  10     num  floatnum  10      outputdict       for place, value in values         outputdict[place]  intnum  value         num  num  value      return outputdict codepre  pusing codegetdigits277.9code, yields codetens 27, ones 2, tenths 8, fives 1codep  pI need for it to say codetens 27, ones 2, tenths 9, fives 1codep  pFixing it by adding 1 to the tenths after the dictionary is populated does not work, because not every decimal comes out imprecisely.p  pcodegetdigits277.6code returns codefives 1, tenths 6, tens 27, ones 2codep  pIve been scouring the forums for an answer, but nothing quite gets it. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 7130 pRelated to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21217429avrgccvariablemustbeconstinordertobeputintoreadonlysectionbymeathis questiona, but a different approach.p  pI am trying to reproduce this a hrefhttpblog.flipwork.nlxentry3aentry100224003937 relnofollow4keykeyboard a and for that I am trying to compile a hrefhttpblog.flipwork.nlfpcontentattachs4keykeyboard.zip relnofollowits sourcea by compiling it with avrgcc on my Linux box.p  pTo solve compiler issues with current version of avrgcc, I downloaded the a hrefhttpwww.obdev.atdownloadsvusbvusb20121206.tar.gz relnofollowlatest release 20121206a of the VUSB library, replaced the old version codeusbdrvcode with the new version codeusbdrvcode in the 4keykeyboard source tree.p  pTo compile the code I changed line 105 in codemain.ccode from codePROGMEM charcode to codePROGMEM const charcode and compile the source code with the following command p  precodeavrgcc main.c I usrlibavrinclude mmcuattiny85 DFCPU16000000 Os I .usbdrv I . usbdrvusbdrv.c usbdrvusbdrvasm.S o main.o codepre  pTo the best of my knowledge, the next step is to create an .elf file. I use the following command for thatp  precodeavrgcc I usrlibavrinclude mmcuattiny85 DFCPU16000000 Os I .usbdrv I . o main.elf main.o codepre  pBut it throws errorsp  precodemain.o In function badinterrupt ........crt1gcrt1.S195 multiple definition of badinterrupt usrlibgccavr4.7.2......avrlibavr25crttn85.o........crt1gcrt1.S195 first defined here main.o In function vectors ........crt1gcrt1.S52 multiple definition of vectors usrlibgccavr4.7.2......avrlibavr25crttn85.o........crt1gcrt1.S195 first defined here collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status codepre  pBoth codebadinterruptcode and codevectorscode refer to the microcontrollers interrupt vector table. It seems to be an issuemisuse with the standard avr libraries, but I cant figure out how these would be linked in twice. As a matter of fact I cannot even locate a file named codegcrt1.Scode on my system.p  pQuestion is How can I solve these errors and what is the causep  pstrongeditstrong It seems that adding the codenostartfilescode flag with the second avrgcc command solves the issue, but why was have I never had before the need for including that parameter when compiling for AVR When I add the flag to one of my own simple ATtiny programs, the vector table is no longer included at all. thanks to angelatlargep  pSo new question Why does the need for this codenostartfilescode parameter come from, what causes itp

Negative 7130 pI have the following xhtml page where there is a form where the user have to select the location where he wants to travel choosing it from a selectionmenu, the panel Volo is updated by an action listener and it will contain another selectionmenu where all flights to that location are available. Id like to select the Hotels and Escursions available between the starting and ending date of the flight, so i used an action listener to update the panel containing the two activities based on the flight chosen. Id like to know where im mistaking and if its possible to have multiple updates of this kind in a single page.

Negative 7130 pIm working on my c program assignment and I cant wrap my head around how to read data in from a file into a 1d array of structures.  My data file looks like thisp  p01 Jimmy Johnsonbr 190 60p  p02 Gerald Hillbr 180 56p  pThe first number being their id, the next to words being their first and last names, and the next line is their height and weight.  My teacher wants me to read this data into an array Astronaut.  And THEN somehow put the correct info into NAME and BODYSTATS, using a 1D array of structures, so I can correctly print the information later.  Ive only gotten as far as reading data into a single array and printing it.  How in the heck do I assign certain words in the array to certain structs and be able to print them laterp

Negative 7130 pToday Im working on making my program faster. This program scans in a 100,000 fake social security numbers, first names, last names and gpas. My professor has started talking about pointers, referencing and dereferencing and has said that using these can help speed a program up by passing addresses. My explanation probably sucks because I am not really understanding the topics in class, so while you guys help me out I will be reading in my book for chapter 9 on call by value and call by reference.

In that assignment, you were required to process an array of integers. Lets update the program with several itemsp  pBuild a structure containing an social security number, first name, last name, and a GPA. The new sort technique that uses the gap concept as described in class that sorts the information in ascending order based on the last name if last names are the same then the first names need to be checked.  The sort technique is know as shell sort. Improve the efficiency  time and space as described below.p  pEach struct element contained an ID, first name, last name and gpa. Suppose you had to process 100,000 students. The program is inefficient for two reasonsp  pSpace issue if social security number takes up 12 characters, first and last take up 20 characters each, and the gpa as a double takes up 8 bytes then the main array of structure elements consumes 1220208100000 bytes of memory. This may be OK if we load up 100,000 names.   But if the average number of students we process is lt50,000, then there is a considerable amount of wasted memory. Time issue When you exchange two elements that are out of order, 60 bytes are moved around 3 times. Total of 180 bytes are moved in memory. Again, inefficient.p  pAs the number of member variables in the struct increase the problem gets worse.p  pThe focus of this assignment is top  pRead a file containing the social security number, first, last, and a gpa into an array of structure elements.  Process until EOF.  Each line contains information about one student.  Inside the struct, the elements may be define as char [] or strings.  Do you think it will make a difference in performance if we use char [] vs strings  Make a prediction. Dump the array into a file along with timing information. Try out the new sort technique  sort structure elements based on two items  first and last name. Time each function to see where the most time is being spent. Attempt to improve the use of memory by using an array of pointers to the structs. Attempt to improve the efficiency by making the exchange faster by swapping pointers instead of elements.p  pWith the above list in mind, there will be three possible grades for the assignment.  For a maximum grade of a C  1420 points, you must complete the first two bullets.  For a maximum grade of a B  1620 points, you must complete the first 4 bullets.  For an A, you must complete all bullets. p  pI would recommend to start the assignment by implementing what I call a non pointer version.  Define a struct above the main function to hold the items.  The main function should declare the array of struct elements.  Call the load, sort, and print functions as we did in the first assignment making adjustments to accommodate the struct and the new sort technique where there are two items to consider before exchanging two elements.  NOTE I want to see an exchange function this time.  This will give you a total of 4 functions.  Make sure you follow the guidelines stated in the first programming assignment.p  pFor all that are attempting the A program, make sure you have the basic program for a B completed and tested before continuing.  Make a copy of that program and modify the program as followsp  pChange the array of struct elements to an array of pointers to struct elements by placing a  in the definition. Using new or malloc, dynamically create space for one structure element just before you read in the values for the members of the struct. When you exchange two elements, exchange two pointers to struct elements instead of the struct elements themselves. Take a look at your times for the nonpointer version and the pointer version.  Is there a significant differencep  pFollowing is the information about timing one function. p  precodeincludeltctimegt Create a couple variables of clockt type. clockt  start, stop start  clock loadx, n   call a function to perform a task stop  clock cout ltlt load time  ltlt doublestop  startCLOCKSPERSEC ltlt endl codepre  pThe function clock returns the number of cpu clock cycles that have occurred since the program started.  Ideally, start in the above code should be 0.  To be able to make some sense of how much time a function takes, you have to convert the elapsed time into seconds.  This is accomplished by taking the difference between start and stop, typecasting, then dividing by the system defined CLOCKSPERSEC.  On linus public or an alien ware machine in the lab is 1,000,000.  Also see class notes on the topic.  The following is an example of what should appear at the end of the sorted data.p  pload time 0.05 sort time 2.36 print time 0.01 Total Run time 2.42p  pThe Penalty for missing deadline, 1 pt per day for a max of 7 days.

Negative 7130 pSo I have this one question. Lets say we have classes codeMaincode, codeInfocode, codeCatscode, codeFoodcodep  pNow, lets say that in main we create new object codeInfocode. In codeInfocode object we are saving list of codeCatscode that have been created. codeCatscode are being created and stored in codeInfocode class and codeFoodcode is being created and stored in codeCatscode class. Now lets say, that in codeMaincode class, I want to get specific codeFoodcode object, which is stored in codeCatscode class. So, in order to do so we do the followingp  pcodeInfo.getFoodnamecode. Then in codeInfoscode codegetFoodcode method we say codeCats.getFoodnamecode. Finally, in codeCatscode class we have method codegetFoodcode, in which we try to find Food object by its field name. If we are unable to find such an element, we throw codeNoSuchElementcode exception rather than return an object. Here is my questionp  pIf we throw exception in codeCatscode class codegetFoodcode method, should we catch that exception in codeMaincode class where our interface is, in codeInfocode class which is our system class or in both of themp

Negative 7130 pI am working with Spring Controller and JSP project. I have a jsp page in which I have one button which is codeProcesscode and once I click that button, it shows me two radio button just below it and a codeSubmitcode button as well.p  pAnd after clicking Submit button, if everything went fine, then I show   as this data will come from controller  p  precodeSuccess true  Error none codepre  pBut as you can see in my a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4Nmqk24 relnofollowjsfiddlea. When my form gets loaded after I hit the jsp url it comes like this on the browser  p  precodeProcess  Success  Error  codepre  pMeaning, it has codeProcesscode button at the top and just below codeSuccesscode and codeErrorcode label with no values in it as we havent passed any values yet from the controller. But it looks pretty weird for the users.p  pSo what I am trying to do is, once my page gets loaded or I click Process button  I dont want to show codeSuccesscode and codeErrorcode labels at all. It should be shown only after the submit button is clicked with its appropriate value in codeSuccesscode and codeErrorcode depending on what is passed from the controller.p  pIs this possible to do in jquery If I am right, basically I want to hide it until submit button is clicked...p  pOr is there any better design to show the Success and Error label with what I am trying to dop

Negative 7130 pIve been making a simple tower defense game as my first project with pygame and Python 3.3.

Negative 7130 pI try to demonstrate my question with a simple example Ive got a small app on android in which the user can login and keeps logged in. Thus I know the userid and have it stored on the smartphone.p  pNow on my server ive got some entries which are user specific and they change from time to time. Id somehow download them so that those entries are available locally in the app, but obviously only the related entries for the logged in user.p  pHow to do that securely p  pI could set up a PHP script which gives the entries of a user with specified ID as a JSONDataarray. But how to make it safe enough so that nobody can exploit the script and e.g. call it from the browser directly I mean I could do something likep  precodeltphp  check and validate GET[userid] ...   select all entries for this id mysqlgtfetch...   return as JSON echo jsonencoderows gt codepre  pand then send a HTTP request from the APP to the server with the specified userid. But I have to make sure that there is no other way to retrieve data then this way.p  pAnd secondly Ive got to make sure that nobody can exploit the android app in that way that he modifies the stored userid to a custom specified one and then uses the app to retrieve the data of different users. That means, there MUSTNT be any way to somehow change the locally stored userid of the currently logged in user. How to do thisp  hr  pOkay, as wtsang02 answers Storing password probably hashedsalted and the userid both locally in the androidstorage of the APP I see following advantagesp  ol liWhen the user tries to modify the local stored userid in any hackedhacky way  he would not be able to retrieve information from the server for a different user different userid because he obviously doesnt know the other userids password. li liWhen somebody changes his password via the homepage of our app, he needs to login within the app because the stored password doesnt match the one in the online database anymore. li liI could use the PHP script as posted above without the need to hide it from direct browser calls make it, something like . Because every call which would come from the browser directly would not simply yield the database entries for a user with specific userid as youd need to know the password itself and then it would ovbiously be legitimate to retrieve the data in any way as youre authenticated, but the user would also need to know how the saltedPassword is exactly calculated hashing function, which salt, how many iterations etc.li ol  pp  precode check and validate GET[userid] and GET[saltedPass] ... ifcorrectCredentials     select all entries for this id   mysqlgtfetch...     return as JSON   echo jsonencoderows  codepre  p But still, one big question remains When I store the userid locally within the android app storage, is it really possible for the user to modify that in any way I thought the local android storage would be emsafeem and restricted to be used by the specific appp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7130 pI have an array of arrays that Im using for the data source of a table view. In one instance of time, I may have to do some complicated modifications to this data structure. For example, a sequence of operations I may need to do is delete a row here, insert a row there, insert a section here, delete another row, insert another row, delete another row, insert another sectionyou get the idea. This is easy to do if, for each operation in the sequence, I just update the data source and then do the corresponding update for the table view immediately. In other words, the pseudocode will look likep  precode[arrayOfArrays updateForOperation1] [tableView updateForOperation1]  [arrayOfArrays updateForOperation2] [tableView updateForOperation2]  [arrayOfArrays updateForOperation3] [tableView updateForOperation3]  [arrayOfArrays updateForOperation4] [tableView updateForOperation4]   Etc. codepre  pHowever, if I were to surround these operations in a beginUpdatesendUpdates block, this code does not work anymore. To see why, imaging beginning with an empty table view and inserting four rows in turn at the beginning of the first section. Heres the pseudocodep  precode[tableView beginUpdates]  [arrayOfArrays insertRowAtIndex0] [tableView insertRowAtIndexPath[row 0, section 0]]  [arrayOfArrays insertRowAtIndex0] [tableView insertRowAtIndexPath[row 0, section 0]]  [arrayOfArrays insertRowAtIndex0] [tableView insertRowAtIndexPath[row 0, section 0]]  [arrayOfArrays insertRowAtIndex0] [tableView insertRowAtIndexPath[row 0, section 0]]  [tableView endUpdates] codepre  pWhen endUpdates gets called, the table view discovers that you are inserting four rows all colliding at row 0p  pIf we REALLY want to keep the beginUpdatesendUpdates part of the code, we have to do something complicated. 1 We do all the updates to the data source without updating the table view as we go along. 2 We figure out how the parts of the data source before all the updates maps to the parts of the data source after all the updates to figure out what updates we need to perform for the table view. 3 Finally, update the table view. The pseudocode looks something like this to accomplish what we were trying to do in the previous examplep  precodeoldArrayOfArrays  [self recordStateOfArrayOfArrays]   Step 1 [arrayOfArrays insertRowAtIndex0] [arrayOfArrays insertRowAtIndex0] [arrayOfArrays insertRowAtIndex0] [arrayOfArrays insertRowAtIndex0]   Step 2  Comparing the old and new version of arrayOfArrays,  we find we need to insert these index paths  [[row 0, section 0],    [row 1, section 0],    [row 2, section 0],    [row 3, section 0]] indexPathsToInsert  [self compareOldAndNewArrayOfArraysToGetIndexPathsToInsert]   Step 3  [tableView beginUpdates]  for indexPath in indexPathsToInsert      [tableView insertIndexPathindexPath]   [tableView endUpdates] codepre  pWhy do all this for the sake of beginUpdatesendUpdates The documentation says to use strongbeginUpdatesstrong and strongendUpdatesstrong to do two thingsp  ol liAnimate a bunch of insert, delete, and other operations emsimultaneouslyemli liIf you do not make the insertion, deletion, and selection calls inside this block, table attributes such as row count might become invalid. What does this really mean exactly anywayli ol  pHowever, if I dont use beginUpdatesendUpdates, the table view looks like its animating the various changes simultaneously, and I dont think the table views internal consistency is being corrupted. So what is the benefit of doing the complicated approach with the beginUpdatesendUpdatesp

Negative 7130 pI have read that Arm V7 ISA gives 4gig of virtual address space for a program. If i take a program in which all the code come within 4kilobyte, my question is whether entire 4gig of space is mapped in page table I we take short descriptor format for building page tables and use a 4k granularity, it will take a lot of space in the ram to hold the page table. So i think the whole 4GB of space for a single process is not mapped but only a part of it is mapped. Is this correct If it is correct then how is it decided how much of the VA is mapped in the tablesp

The most striking visual difference is that the top navigation bar is completely different, which is why we use crossfade between the two as visual cue to the mode change.p  pAs the animation is playing , theres a lot else happening in the browser  DOM is updated and redrawn, XHRs are done, objects are createdampdestroyed etc. End result is that the animation becomes quite choppy.

Negative 7130 pI am using NGINX version 1.2.5. Under load serving requests, I encountered memory loss. I found three memory leaks which I fixed in code that I inherited. The leaks were in the response handling code where memory was not freed properly especially if NGXAGAIN was encountered due to SSL back pressure.p  pHowever, it prompted this curious situation when the memory leak was happening. I typically reload NGINX on a regular basis to grab new configuration that I posted on an hourly basis. I have one master and four workers. When the memory leak was happening, and memory was depleted on my linux box, the reload would fail at the end of two days since there wasnt enough memory left to start a new worker and remove the old one. That I understand, but what confuses me, is why on every reload, since the old worker was removed, the memory leak wouldnt be masked since a process is removed and its memory should have been returned to Linux. When I perform an NGINX restart, that would return all leaked memory. The difference that I gather is that on a restart the master worker is also brought down. But isnt every worker running with its own memory scopep  pCan someone explain to me how memory is handled differently in a reload versus a restart that can explain this behaviorp  pThank you.p  pHere is some more information I got, maybe it can she some light.p  pI perform a service nginx startp  psh4.1 service nginx status nginx pid 19610 19609 19608 19607 19593 is running... sh4.1 ps ef  grep nginx root 19593 1 7 1624  000004 nginx master process usrlocalbinnginx c etcnginxnginx.conf nobody 19607 19593 0 1624  000000 nginx worker process nobody 19608 19593 0 1624  000000 nginx worker process nobody 19609 19593 0 1624  000000 nginx worker process nobody 19610 19593 0 1624  000000 nginx worker process root 19653 19083 0 1625 pts1 000000 grep nginx sh4.1p  pIn the logs, I print out the PID where the memory allocator is initializedp  psh4.1 grep 19571  error.log20140604 162436.535 0000 [error] ngxhttpurlfilteringinitcloudaddonsngxhttpurlfilteringmodule.c603 Allocating the allocator PID of this process 19571p  pI looked up 19571 ands it does not exist anymore.

Negative 7130 pI have both a web app and an Android app that currently offer a Google OpenID 2.0 login option. I am in the process of migrating them to Google Sign In, since OpenID 2.0 is deprecated.p  pFor the web app, I am following the migration process described a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiauthmigrationoid2 relnofollowherea, where I add the codedataopenidrealmcode attribute to the Sign In button.  As a result, when the login is completed, the codeidtokencode that I get includes an codeopenididcode field, containing the users OpenID 2.0 identifier. I can use this to determine perfectly whether the user already has an account on my site.p  pFor the Android app, I intend to implement Google Sign In using the codeSignInButtoncode widget, as described a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commobileandroidsignin relnofollowherea. However, I dont see any option equivalent to the codedataopenidrealmcode attribute. How can I get the codeopenididcode value so that I can recognize my existing OpenID users when they loginp  pI know that I could try to match the users by email address, but this will not result in perfect matching, and some users would be unable to access their existing accounts.  I know that I could also implement a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsOAuth2Login relnofollowOpenID Connecta directly which would allow passing the codeopenid.realmcode parameter, instead of using the codeSignInButtoncode widget, but this would not be as good of a user experience, and Google discourages it.p  pSo what does Google offer for migrating an Android app from OpenID to Googlep

Negative 7130 pIm looking into my code as I have a slight increase in memory usage reported by Windows over time. I have added the debugfeatures from VS2012 to test for memory leaks, and I found none.p  pSo, Im looking into if any of my containers vector,deque,etc. are increasing unchecked.p  pNow, Im currently writing manual checks for each container, but Id rather do something clever and learn new stuff in the process. However, I dont know quite how to start.p  pWhat Im looking for is an automated way to change my container allocations to include information like file and line position of allocation, and display this when the destructor is called.

The problem is that moving the dockee does not seem to trigger any Windows messages for it which can then be used to move any windows dependent on it. I set up handlers for codeWMMOVEcode, codeWMMOVINGcode, and codeWMWINDOWPOSCHANGINGcode to see if any of them are sent, but nothing is.p  pSince the cascade sometimes works and sometimes not, I thought maybe the message to the next window was getting sent before the handler for the previous one could finish, so I added the codecriticalcode directive to the message handler, however that not help. Also, since the handler for the other window never seems to be called at any time, my theory doesnt seem to be correct.p  pWhats strange is that the probability of it cascading correctly goes from 0 up to 75 if I keep my debugging code which merely calculates a few variables and adds a line to a textcontrol in a debug window. Commenting out parts of it affects the chances so that it drops to 50. Because of this, I thought it might be a timing issue, so I tried adding a codeSleepcode command with varying values to see if it could force the cascade to work 100, but that did not.p  pDoes anyone know what could be wrong and how to fix it It will probably turn out to be something simple like handling the wrong message or returning the wrong value.p

Negative 7130 pI have created a simple call filter using a for loop that goes through a database and searches for a saved number. This filter works great on my device, but when I send it to my client, it automatically allows every call to go through. The filter is showing the Deflecktur allowed a call from ..., so I know that we are getting to the ifelse statement. For some reason it is just always going with the else statement on his device.

This XML has multiple types of namespaces throughout and I am able to retrieve all different objects I need but I am stuck after that.p  pI want to be able to take the coordinate objects from the XML blockxcoord, and blockycoord and plot them on a map.  Am I unsuccessful because I am using a URL as my data source  Why is this so difficult  What is the easiest way to do this  Convert to KML  My attempts with the google maps api V3 havent been successful so I did not include that code here but could use all the recommendations I could get.  If my attempts would help figure more out then I can post that here.  p  pI just want to know if what I have done here can be easily converted to markers on a map.  I want to load markers on a map live as the file updates.  I have not tried this with a local data source yet.

Another, perfectly existent variable myvar whose value is an empty string, will stop being seen through a call to codeGetEnvironmentVariablecode, but it is still seen via iteration of the whole environment.p  pThis behavior probably cannot be recreated purely using .NET APIs because they dont allow setting an environment variable to an empty string but the native APIs allow that.p  pIt feels very strange that a call to codeEnvironment.GetEnvironmentVariablecode would make another variable disappear, or halfdisappear, from the environment.p  pThe behavior with target framework set to .NET 2.0 is subtly different.  The mismatch between getting codemyvarcode directly, and iteration, occurs immediately after the native call to codeSetEnvironmentVariablecode  it is not necessary to query for another variable to see it.p  pstrongEditstrong Adding codeCharsetCharSet.Autocode, as kindly suggested by Hans Passant thanks reduces the craziness level of .NET 4.5.x to that of .NET 2.0, exactly as described in the previous paragraph, apart from fixing Unicode handling.  The codeDllImportcode is also missing a codeSetLastErrorcode parameter, but this is just an artificial example and we know that this native call is successful on the Win32 level.  So, so far no explanation.

Negative 7130 pIm using the EVO PDF, Html PDF generator, and Ive come across a scenario that I cannot seem to solve. Im unsure if a solution exists with the software itself.p  pI have 2 metric data tables that are side by side, using data that always creates the same amount of rows. The reason they are not a single table is, 1 data is showing different scopes, and 2 styling purposes.p  pEVO PDF will repeat all table headers for tables that get cutoff at pagebreak, and display them at the top of the next page. The issue is if 2 tables get cutoff, the software creates two headers at the top of the next page. Each of the headers spans the entire page width, and they stack on top of one another. Visually the table headers are the correct width, but the second header is bumped down.p  pIs anyone aware of a way to have the headers coexist, per se Or has anyone else run into this issuep

Im using the Windows system function GetProcessMemoryInfo in a lot of situations around the code to debug this problem and it seems to return an actual value for used virtual memory.p  pIm using Visual Studio C 2010 Professional.p  pLet me know if more information are needed.p  pThanks for any replies.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pEverything you wrote in your replies is correct and I forgot the following detailsp  ol liI already know that a vector has a size actual number of elements and a capacity allocated slots to store elementsli liI already know that the erase method does not free memory I looked for a lot of documentation about that methodli lifinally, I will add other elements to that vector later, so I dont need to shrink that vector.li ol  pThe actual problem is that in that case, the value of mem1 in the last line of code shows a difference of 1.600.000 bytes unjustified increase of memory, while I expected to be 0 bytes.p  pAlso in the case where the value of used memory after the operation would be less than the first one, I would expect a very big number for what is explained for instance at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7221409isunsignedintegersubtractiondefinedbehaviorIs unsigned integer subtraction defined behaviorap  pInstead of the expected results I get a value greater than 0 but relatively short.p  pTo better understand the incidence of the problem, iterating some thousands of times on that piece of code, unexpectedly allocates about 20 Gb of virtual memory.p

When I changed the subscription to be send out to the User Groups, the email subscription failed.

Negative 7130 pHello and have a nice day everyone. I, being not an actual coder, managed to overcome dropdown list issue in basic html, then in php using javascript in Dreamweaver.

Here is the link i benefited from. a hrefhttpwww.plus2net.comphptutorialphpdropdownlist.php relnofollowhttpwww.plus2net.comphptutorialphpdropdownlist.phpap  pMy problem is with a Wordpress page.

However my goal is to generate a second drop down with the selected value of the first one. Like the first one is car brands, and the second one is models. p  pTo do this how can i use wpdropdownpages function If I must, how can i do this using AJax or just Javascript p  pThank you all in advance.p

Negative 7130 pI would like to have a bar graph in graphitegrafana that has a single bar per day, over the week. Ideally we would have the days of the week Monday,Tuesday...etc on the x axis labels, and then seven bars in the graph, one for each day of the week.  I cant seem to change the X axis at all though.  p  pThoughts I could cook the time data, and send it a fixed time since epoch value, but this results in a very thin bar on the grafana page. I could write a script to send a huge amount of metrics with seconds since epoch values representing the entire day in order to make the semblance of a daily bar, but that still doesnt help me change xaxis labels and seems like a horrible way to use this tool. p  pCan this even be done with graphite, or is it strictly focused on real time graphsp

Negative 7130 pI have code written in F but I believe it the choice of language doesnt matter that calls ListBlobs for each entry in the list of Azure blob directories, about 50 entries in total. The total time for all calls is about 20 seconds. Heres how the original code looksp  precodeenumerateDirectories container gt Seq.map fun x gt listBlobs x gt Seq.concat codepre  pThe function listBlobs is a simple wrapper around Azure blob storage ListBlobs method. Since blob listings are independent from each other, I tried running them asynchronouslyp  precodeenumerateDirectories container gt Seq.map fun x gt             async                   printfn listBlobs s x                   return listBlobs x               gt Async.Parallel gt Async.RunSynchronously gt Seq.concat codepre  pBut the execution time didnt improve at all. Then I changed F async workflow with the parallel sequence call from the pseq modulep  precodeenumerateDirectories container gt PSeq.map fun x gt listBlobs x gt Seq.concat codepre  pThis improved the execution time so it took only half of what it used to be. Still, it takes about 10 seconds comparing to a less than a second for a single ListBlob call. I wonder why. Shouldnt calls to ListBlobs execute concurrently so the total time would be comparable with the single call time plus some overheadp

Negative 7130 pRecently I ran into an issue with a node.js API where my memory was growing larger and larger with every request. Im hosting my server on Heroku using their free version which is only 512MB of RAM. After getting a lot of traffic over the weekend, I started getting exceeded memory errors from Heroku so I began searching for a memory leak in my code to no avail. I wasnt keeping around any objects, everything should have been getting cleaned up and quite frankly, I was lost.p  pHowever, after doing some research, I found node.js runs the garbage collector when the maxoldspacesize variable is reached and is defaulted to 1024MB on 64bit systems. Ive set this to 410 80 of my available memmory but wonder if I should just handle this in the code Obviously it would be ideal to upgrade my instance and just have the normal default cap but thats not an option right now.p  pExample    p  precode lets assume there is some apiGet function  that calls back with a very very large object with  the following structure         status success,       statusCode 200,       messages [],       data  users [ huge array of users ]     we have a manipulateData function thats going  to do some stuff to the returned data and the  call some callback to give the data to the caller function manipulateDatacallback      apiGetfunctionerror, veryLargeObject          var users  veryLargeObject.data.users         var usefulUsers  users.mapfunctionuser               do some data calculations here and then              return just those properties we needed                   callbacknull, usefulUsers       codepre  pSo in this example, once manipulateData is done running, if I understand correctly, the veyLargeObject is now going to be set for garbage collection since there arent any more pointers that have access to it the returned usefulUsers is a new array created by the map. But this doesnt necessarily mean that all the memory that it was taking up is free, correct Would it be wise to set veryLargeObject  null or undefined before calling the callbackp  pI hope what Im asking makes sense. Basically Is it a good idea to set large objects to null or undefined when theres no intent to use them anymore or should they just be left around for the garbage collector to clean up Does the answer to this question change when youre only given 512MB of RAM vs having 8GB of RAMp

Negative 7130 pI do not know what is good for an desktop application.p  pI have a functionprocess file upload which takes longer depending the file size so in order to prevent the app being blocked by the process. I think a good solutions is creating a thread but my doubt is what is better p  p1 to have a thread running forever and every time the process must be done activate it and execute the process, here the thread is created just once but it is alive during all the application life time. But I guess it is not a good practice because the CPU time consumption running in a while True loopp  p2 I was evaluating a scheduler but the problem is that it is important the task upload must be made in FIFO order. So if the internet connection fails, I store this tasks to be done in a database. Therefore if 2 actions are stored in the database and x1 must be done before x2 it depends entirely in the time it takes x1 to be done so calculating a delay is complicated.  The enter function has a delay according to this link a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarysched.html relnofollowhttpsdocs.python.org2librarysched.htmla p  p3 every time the process is called create a thread and execute it but the thread is destroyed once the process is done.  Note with a singleton pattern because of file size  time issue. There are 2 file x1  15MB and x2  1MB. x1 takes 5sec and x2 takes 0.5sec so if 2 threads are created there is no FIFO order. p  pIs there any other possible solution good[practiceperformance]solutionp  pAlso I just want to clarify I am interested in the performancegood practice solution not about the code.p

Negative 7130 pIm pretty new to Angular or JavaScript in general and I have a dumb question here. I understand how promises work, but under what specific circumstances will a promise returned by a codehttpcode request codePUTcode or codeGETcode or whatever be rejected Im pretty sure that if a request times out then the promise will definitely be rejected but what about other errors like 404 or 403 I couldnt find any such information from Angular Docs...

Negative 7130 pI am new to Spring Java config, and was wondering something.p  pTraditionnally Spring webapps have had 2 different contexts, the root application context and the dispatcher servlet context. The root context contains basically everything up to the service layer persistence configuration like JPA and data access layer and the servlet context containing all MVC and other webrelated things.p  pThe web context inherits from the root context, so web components have access to beans in the root context but not the opposite.p  pWith a modern approach using XMLless config and a codeorg.springframework.web.WebApplicationInitializercode, does it still make sense to have 2 different contexts p  pIt would seem simpler to just have a few annotated codeConfigurationcode classes regrouping beans by layer e.g. one for data access layer, one for service layer, one for web layer and load all of them in the same context, like this p  precodepublic class MyWebApplicationInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer       Override     public void onStartupServletContext container            Create the dispatcher servlets Spring application context         AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext dispatcherServletContext  new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext         dispatcherServletContext.registerMyPersistenceConfig.class, MyServicesConfig.class, MyMvcConfig.class           Register and map the dispatcher servlet         ServletRegistration.Dynamic dispatcher  container.addServletdispatcher, new DispatcherServletdispatcherServletContext         dispatcher.setLoadOnStartup1         dispatcher.addMapping        codepre  pHowever I have seen examples where a root context is still created, and its lifecycle managed using a codeorg.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListenercode like this p  precodepublic class MyWebApplicationInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer       Override     public void onStartupServletContext container            Create the root Spring application context         AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext rootContext  new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext         rootContext.registerMyPersistenceConfig.class, MyServicesConfig.class           Manage the lifecycle of the root application context         container.addListenernew ContextLoaderListenerrootContext           Create the dispatcher servlets Spring application context         AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext dispatcherServletContext  new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext         dispatcherServletContext.registerMyMvcConfig.class           Register and map the dispatcher servlet         ServletRegistration.Dynamic dispatcher  container.addServletdispatcher, new DispatcherServletdispatcherServletContext         dispatcher.setLoadOnStartup1         dispatcher.addMapping       codepre  pFor a simple webapp single maven module, does the second approach bring any concrete benefits that balance the extra complexity  What is the best practice p

The tables size is on the order of 25,000 rows by 200 columns.p  pFunction codereadexcelcode works a treat. My only problem is with its assignment of column class datatype to sparsely populated columns.  For example, a given column may be NA for 20,000 rows and then will take a character value on row 20,001. codereadexcelcode appears to default to column type numeric when scanning the first n rows of a column and finding codeNAscode only. The data causing the problem are chars in a column assigned numeric. When the error limit is reached, execution halts. I actually want the data in the sparse columns, so setting the error limit higher isnt a solution.p  pI can identify the troublesome columns by reviewing the warnings thrown. And codereadexcelcode has an option for asserting a columns datatype by setting argument codecoltypescode according to the package docs p  pstrongEither codeNULLcode to guess from the spreadsheet or a character vector containing codeblankcode,codenumericcode, codedatecode or codetextcode.strongp  pBut does this mean I have to construct a vector of length 200 populated in almost every position with codeblankcode and codetextcode in handful of positions corresponding to the offending columnsp  pTheres probably a way of doing this in a couple lines of codeRcode code. Create a vector of the required length and fill it with codeblankcodes.  Maybe another vector containing the numbers of the columns to be forced to codetextcode, and then ... Or maybe its possible to call out for codereadexcelcode just the columns for which its guesses arent as desired.p  pId appreciate any suggestions. p  pThanks in advance.p

The problem Ive been dealing with is solely based on the part of the program that uses the FTPS class. Whenever I try to connect to the server it gives an error steps down to the catch statement below. Ive been working on 2 different source codes actually theyre basically the same but I got the same problem and it made me think that I may have some problems with the settings of Filezilla Server. I put down all the class codes below, any kind of help will be appreciated.
