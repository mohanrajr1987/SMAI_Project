Positive 69458 pI have a codeUserControlcode which needs two codeRotateTransformcodes, one to rotate around its topleft corner i.e. code0,0code and another to rotate around its center.p  pUp until now I only needed it to rotate around the center, and this was easily done by setting the controls codeRenderTransformOrigincode to code0.5,0.5code.p  pHow can I set a different origin for each rotate transform  p  hr  pNote that Im also using other transformations around the center so I need them all to work together, so I could use a codeTransformGroupcode to rotatescaletranslate around the center,but I need a separate codeRotateTransformcode that rotates around the topleft corner only  How would I do that p

Positive 69458 pI started a new metro shared project, and creating usercontrols in shared part to use in both metro sides. I decided to enlarge my fontsize on my controls, for better visibility and because I do not want to do it on all controls I put this setting into app.xaml in the shared part, like thisp  precodeltApplication     xClassGeeksitter.App     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     xmlnslocal...gt    ltApplication.Resourcesgt     ltStyle TargetTypeUserControlgt       ltSetter PropertyFontSize Value18 gt     ltStylegt   ltApplication.Resourcesgt ltApplicationgt codepre  pThis did not work, it did not change the font size on usercontrols.p  pWhen I changed to codeltStyle TargetTypeUserControl xKeyprbagtcode and on consumer side codeStyleStaticResource prbacode, it worked, but this is not much better then modifying all the controls again.p  pstrongSo my question is how to set up a metro application, so it will use styles from app.xamlstrong styles those are strongdefault stylesstrong of course  with targettype only strongstrongp

Positive 69458 pI have met an issue of unproper selection of items in codeTListBoxcode in my application with a codeHorzScrollBoxcode in the form. The form  has two or more codeTListBoxcode on it.

The error appears in the following sequence of user actions.p  ol liAn item is selected from the left codeTListBoxcodeli liThe HorzScrollBox is scrolled to the right and the second codeTListBoxcode becomes visible to user and the left one  invisible.li liThe HorzScrollBox is scrolled back to the left.li liAn new item is selected from the left codeTListBoxcode.li ol  pWe get the following picture The new item is selected but the selection stays painted over the position of the previously selected item even if we scroll the box up and down. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comgJByL.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgJByL.jpg altenter image description hereap  pIt is possible to reproduce the bug in a very simple way. p  ol liCreate a new Grid MetropolisUI Application.li liReplace the left standard codeTListBoxcode with a new one it will be faster.li liSet the width of the form larger then your screen widthli liPlace the second new codeTListBoxcode inside the codeHorzScrollBoxcode in such a way so that left and right codeTListboxescode will not be seen simultaneously and selection of items is possible only after scrolling of the codeHorzScrollBoxcode.li liPopulate them from any sources ex. two codeTPrototypeBindSourcecode and set the codeListItemStylecode properties of created codeLinkFieldControlToFieldcode to codeMetropolisUIcode.li ol  pDone.

Negative 69458 pMy company has developed a long standing product using MFC in Visual C as the defacto standard for UI development. Our codebase contains ALOT of legacyarchaic code which must be kept operational. Some of this code is older than me originally written in the late 70s and some members of our team are still on Visual Studio 6.p  pHowever, a conclusion has thankfully been reached internally that our product is looking somewhat antiquated compared to our competitors, and that something needs to be done.p  pI am currently working on a new area of the UI which is quite separate from the rest of the product. I have therefore been given the chance to try out new technology stacks as a sort of proving ground before the long process of moving over the rest of the UI begins.p  pI have been using C with Windows Forms and the .net framework for a while in my spare time and enjoy it, but am somewhat worried about the headaches caused by interop. While this particular branch of the UI wont require much interop with the legacy C codebase, I can forsee this becoming an issue in the future.p  pThe alternative is just to continue with MFC, but try and take advantage of the new feature pack that shipped with VS2008. This I guess is the easiest option, but I worry about longevity and not taking advantage of the goodness that is .net...p  pSo, which do I pick Were a small team so my recommendation will quite probably be accepted as a future direction for our development  I want to get it right.p  pIs MFC dead Is CWinforms the way forward Is there anything else Im totally missing Help greatly appreciatedp

Negative 69458 pIm developing a python framework that would have addons written as separate packages. I.e.p  precodeimport myframework from myframework.addons import foo, bar codepre  pNow, what Im trying to arrange is so that these addons can be distributed separately from core framework and injected into codemyframework.addonscode namespace.p  pCurrently my best solution to this is the following. An addon would be deployed most likely into codepythonversionsitepackagescode like sop  precodefooext fooextinit.py fooextmyframework fooextmyframeworkinit.py fooextmyframeworkaddons fooextmyframeworkaddonsinit.py fooextmyframeworkaddonsfoo.py codepre  pThe codefooextmyframeworkaddonsinit.pycode would have the pkgutil path extension codep  precodeimport pkgutil path  pkgutil.extendpathpath, name codepre  pThe problem is that for this to work, the PYTHONPATH needs to have codefooextcode in it, however the only thing it would have is the parent install directory most likely, the abovementioned codesitepackagescode. p  pThe solution to this is to have extra code in codemyframeworkaddonsinit.pycode which would tranverse codesys.pathcode and look for any modules with a myframework subpackage, in which case it adds it to codesys.pathcode and everything works.p  pAnother idea I had is to write the addon files directly to codemyframeworkaddonscode install location, but then it would make development and deployed namespace differ.p  pIs there a better way to accomplish this or perhaps a different approach to the above distribution problem altogetherp

Negative 69458 pThis question isnt about the database design of the RBAC system itself, but rather how to use this database in conjunction with the application specific database when that web application allows its users to submit content.p  pAs it stands my RBAC should easily work for a simple backend admin application, where staff can add and update records  an online store for example does not generally have user submitted content.  The two databases can remain separate.  However, I am not sure how I could reuse my RBAC design with a websiteapplication that allows its users to submit content.

Negative 69458 pIm writing firmware for a PIC32MX, using HiTech PICC32. One of the problems I want to avoid is that since most of the pins have multiple names eg. AN0  RB0  CN2  PGED1, I or someone else might accidentally use RB0 without realising that AN0 is already used. This can actually be catastrophic, since incorrectly configuring an analoguedigital pin can lead to excessive current draw and release of essential smoke.p  pAs well as comprehensively documenting every pin used, I was wondering if there was a quick way to head this issue off at the level of coding. I want a macro that people mainly myself can use, say codeCLAIMPIN58code, that will issue a warning or error if it is run twice.p  pI dont want this at all costs, if the only possible solution is too horrendous or unmaintainable then Ill forget about it and just develop a reputation for bursting into tears or setting myself on fire or something. I also saw this question about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions860273macroproducingmacrosincmacro producing macrosa, which rules out that.p  pI should clarify the code IS written in multiple compilation units at least, I think this is what the phrase means. I have a .h.c file for my A2D code, similarly for SPI, and similarly for various peripherals that just use certain IO ports. Space is not emreallyem a problem, my code leaves plenty of room on the PIC32MX also I can use another DEBUG flag to remove the pin checking code for final use.p

Still others, like administrators, have accounts that dont run by semester.p  pWhen someone is no longer a grader or instructor, she still needs to be able to access past grading or classroom records, albeit with fewer privileges view only. p  pIve thought about implementing a roles table with a semester as a part of the key, but that doesnt apply to all users. Ive also thought about keeping the semester data separate from the roles, but making roles like PastGrader and PastInstructor to cover those people who need to have access to past information but should not be allowed to participate in this semester.p  pWhat is the optimal data modelroles model for this applicationp

Negative 69458 pIm trying my hand at google appengine and using the datastore with php and quercus.  Im not familiar with Java or Python, so lots of learning going on here. Ive got pages rendering, and im able to get data in and out of the datastore.p  pThe app I am building has users, groups, topics and comments.  A group has users, and users can belong to multiple groups.  When a user logs in, I display the groups they are members of, and the topics of those groups. p  pIve got this currently built in MySql, and am now figuring out how to get it into appengine.p  pThe way I see it, a group is a parent which has topics and users as children. Topics have comments as children. p  pHowever, I have to get the groups that a user belongs to when the user logs in. Therefore, I was thinking of a separate parent entity which stores the user, contact and login info, and that user would have children containing the group id which each user belongs to, so that I know what groups to fetch. p  pThe users are children of the group so that I can display all the users of a group, but maybe there is a more efficient way to do it. p  pLike thisp  pre GroupsEntityGroup  GroupName, Owner 8627 Topics  TopicName, Content, Owner        8627 Comments  Comment, Owner 8627 Users  userid  UsersEntityGroup  userName, email, password 8627 userGroup  groupid pre  pThen, when a user logs in, the logic looks like thisp  pre SELECT groupid FROM Users where passwordhashofpassworduniqueusername foreachgroupid as group    SELECT users from group    SELECT topics from group    foreachtopicid as topic      SELECT comments        pre  pThe reason Im looking at it like this is because when a user logs in, I cant very well go looking through each group for the user, and I only would want to store the login info in one place. p  pPlease dont recommend me to the code.google.com documentation, as Ive gone through that many times already, but am not completely understanding whats going on with appengine. p  palso, is the way Ive outlined above the proper way to visualize the datastore I think visualizing the data has been a struggle which might be causing some of the challenges. p

Some have not been tested yet I did not mention this part in my last question.p  pWould I be better off making a mySQL table likep  precodeNAME         PRODUCT1     PRODUCT2     PRODUCT3     PRODUCT4 .... product1     yes          no           maybe        yes product2     maybe        yes          no           no product3     maybe        yes          no           no product4     maybe        yes          no           no ... codepre  por making the table likep  precodeFIRST       SECOND      COMPATIBLE Product1    Product1    Yes Product1    Product2    Yes Product1    Product3    No Product1    Product4    Maybe Product2    Product1    Maybe Product2    Product2    Maybe Product2    Product3    No Product2    Product4    Maybe Product3    Product1    Yes Product3    Product2    Yes Product3    Product3    No Product3    Product4    Yes Product4    Product1    Yes Product4    Product2    No Product4    Product3    No Product4    Product4    Maybe codepre  pI was told that the second method would be better, but I failed to mention that there was also the maybe option and not purely yesno, meaning the third column would have to be added to the second table.p  pAs an inexperienced mySQLer, I ask, which table would be more efficient, more maintainable, and which would you recommendp  pThanksp

Negative 69458 pOur company is running a Java application on a single CPU Windows server to read data from a TCPIP socket and check for specific criteria using regular expressions and if a match is found, then store the data in a MySQL database. The data is huge and is read at a rate of 800 recordssecond and about 70 of the records will be matching records, so there is a lot of database writes involved. The program is using a LinkedBlockingQueue to handle the data. The producer class just reads the record and puts it into the queue, and a consumer class removes from the queue and does the processing. p  pSo the question is will it help if I use multiple consumer threads instead of a single thread Is threading really helpful in the above scenario since I am using single CPU I am looking for suggestions on how to speed up without changing hardware. p  pAny suggestions would be really appreciated.

Negative 69458 pIn some legacy code i have see the following extension method to facilitate adding a new keyvalue item or updating the value, if the key already exists.p  pMethod1 legacy code.p  precodepublic static void CreateNewOrUpdateExistingltTKey, TValuegt     this IDictionaryltTKey, TValuegt map, TKey key, TValue value                  if map.ContainsKeykey              map[key]  value          else              map.Addkey, value       codepre  pThough, I have checked that codemap[key]valuecode  does exactly the same job. That is, this method could be replace with Method2 below.p  pMethod2.p  precodepublic static void CreateNewOrUpdateExistingltTKey, TValuegt     this IDictionaryltTKey, TValuegt map, TKey key, TValue value      map[key]  value  codepre  pNow, my question is.. Could there be any problem if i replace Method1 by Method2 Will it break in any possible scenariop  pAlso, I think this used to be the difference between HashTable and Dictionary. HashTable allows updating an item, or adding a new item by using indexer while Dictionary does not Is this difference been eliminated in C  3.0 versionsp  pThe objective of this method is not too throw exception if user sends the same keyvalue again, the method should just update the entry with the new value, and to make a new entry if new keyvalue pair has been send to the method.p

Negative 69458 pI am currently developing a business application that will ultimately be hosted at a .Net hosting company. The hosting company provides 1 MSSQL DB with 2 users and an unlimited number of MySQL DBs. Purchasing a second MSSQL DB is out of the question as my boss doesnt want to pay any more for the hosting. I am trying to determine the best place to house the ASPNETDB for site authentication and roles.p  pMy first thought was to take advantage of one of the MySQL DBs for this purpose but have noticed that it appears to take some hoop jumping to accomplish this option. Another option may be to keep the ASPNETDB in a Express DB file. p  pFinally, I have also thought about housing it in the MSSQL DB with the application tables. This option scares me because if I accidentally screw something up in the application, the ASPNETDB tables could be open to SQL injection. Of course, I will do my best to ensure this wont happen anyway, but would like to know I have that extra layer of security knowing it is housed in its own DB.p  pThe hosting company does allow two MSSQL DB users, so this in theory would allow me to have one user dedicated to authentication and restrict the other user from being able to access the ASPNETDB tables all together.p  pAs a fellow developer, what method would you recommend Thanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 69458 pI am working on a BI application in WPF. I am in the process of designing its architecture and am in search of a way to directly bind controls in the view to a xml which contains the metadata of the view. Do you think this is going to be possible then how or is it advisable to read off from the xml and generate the views accordinglyp  pstrongEditedstrongp  pProperties such as colors of charts, who created the chart, the next chart upon drilling down a chart, the user names and their passwords, user group names etc. are stored in XML files. When a user starts the application the dashboards he has created should be displayed this happens with the retrieval of data from the back end and by assigning the correct chart colors. So if these data are available in the XML, my question is the best way to generate the charts and dashboards upon user request.p  pstrongEditedstrong img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZcid3.jpg altScreenshot of a dashboard we currently load from xml, through a normal read write operationp  pAs I explained earlier as well, the problem is to store the metadata related to this application in the most efficient and structured way to call back upon a user loging in.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 69458 pI am creating a new DB in MySQL for an application and wondered if anyone could provide some advice on the following set up. Ill try and simplify things as best as I can.p  pThis DB is designed to store alerts which are related to specific items created by a user. In turn there is the need to store notes related to the items andor alerts. At first I considered  the following structure...p  pUSERS table  to store basic app user info e.g. userid. name, email  this is the only bit Im fairly certain does not need to be changedp  pITEMS table contains info on particular item 4 fields or so. Contains userid to indicate which user createdowns this itemp  pALERTS table contains info on the alert, itemid to indicate which item the alert is related to, contains userid to indicate which user created alertp  pNOTES table contains note info, userid of note owner, itemid if associated with an item, alertid if associated with alertp  pRelationshipsp  pAn item does not always have an an alert associated with it An item or alert does not always have a note associated with itp  pAn alert is always associated with an item. More than one alert can be associated with the same item.p  pA note is always associated with an item or alert. More than one note can be associated with the same item or alert.p  pOnce first created item info is unlikely to be updated by a user. p  pFor arguments sake lets say that each user will create an average of 10 items, each item will have an average of 2 alerts associated with it. There will be an average of 2 notes per itemalert.p  pVery common queries that will be runp  p1 Return all items created by a particular user with any associated alerts and notes. Given a userid this query would span 3 tablesp  p2 Checking each day for alerts that need to be sent to a users email address.  WHERE alert datetoday, return users email address, item name and any associated notes. This would require a query spanning 4 tables which is why Im wondering if I need to take a different approach...p  pOption 1 one table to cover items, alerts and notes. userid owner for each row. Every time you add a note to an item or alert you are repeating the alert andor item info. Seems a bit wasteful but item and alert info wont be large. p  pOption 2 I dont foresee the need to query notes famous last words so how about serializing note data so multiple notes are stored in one row in either the item or alert table or just a combined alertitem tablep  pOption 3 Anything else you can think of Im asking this question as each option Ive considered doesnt feel quite right.p  pI appreciate this is currently a small project and so performance shouldnt be of great concern and I should just go with the 4 tables. Its more that my common queries will end up being relatively complex that makes me think I need to reevaluate the structure.p

Negative 69458 pWhen you are using YUIs CSS scheme, fontsizes are based off of s instead of pixels because it gives a better overall consistent fontsize across browsers.p  pBut if you have elements with fontsizes set on them, then any elements nested inside it that have fontsize set is thrown off.

The example is there only to demonstrate the principalproblem. Anyways, having to individually style each element seems kinda dump.p  pSo I just wanted to see if I was missing something. The systemmethod completely breaks if your wrap any codefontsizecodestyled elements with any other codefontsizecodestyled elements. Like what happens if you want all your text on the page to have a base size of 12px instead of 13px, which is the YUI default Making that change throws off ALL s for every element on the page. The only solution would be to leave 13px as the base size and individually style MANY MANY elements with the 12px size.p

When looking at the example code, the codeUPDATEcode line, which effects table4, only columns within table4 are used theyre adding 1 to the value.  Also, theyre using codeWHERE  a3  NEW.a1code.  I dont think that ids work that way.  There shouldnt be a universal ID that works across tables.  They should definitely be using an interdependency table in the example, for applicability.p  pI actually asked a similar question earlier today about what a good method for doing this would be, but now Im wondering, simply, if there is a method.  Thanks for reading. p  pHere is an example of a trigger that updates another table, but it doesnt seem to use a delimeterp  precodeCREATE TRIGGER mytrigger BEFORE INSERT ON odp  FOR EACH ROW   UPDATE totalpoints SET points  points  NEW.points codepre  pWhat isnt explained in this example is how codeodpcode and codetotalpointscode overlap.  How can we be sure that the codetotalpointscode tables codepointscode row is the correct codepointscode row  Which row in the codepointscode table would MySQL update  xp  pSo, shouldnt there be some way to specify which of the totalpoints.points rows to update codeBEFORE INSERT ON odpcodep

Negative 69458 pIm currently doing research on the best ways to provide an advanced search for my php project.p  pI have narrowed it down to using FULLTEXT search rather than using LIKE to find matching strings in a table row. However, to do this it appears I need to sacrifice using the InnoDB engine which will make me lose the ACIDity of transactions and table relationships.p  pIs it really worth using the MYISAM mysql engine or are there better ways of providing search functionality.p  pAny pointers would be appreciatedp

Negative 69458 pHopefully this question is not to confusing, but I can help clear it up and there emisem a definitive answer Yes or No and why of course. I develop a lot of eminternal intranetem applications using ASP.NET Webforms targeted for the Windows Environment and IE. This allows things like Windows Authentication and the draganddrop ASP.NET server controls work extreamly well and the focus is typically on the function rather than the pazzaz or the look of the site Im not selling products here to the masses.p  pHowever some users are starting to use Macs, and as we know the default browser is Safari. Unfortunantly Safari does not support Windows Authentication. To add on, a lot of the outofthe box ASP.NET server controls dont render properly as they do in IE. Plus I have to take into account all the differences I need in my .js as well.p  pNow looking at this from an internal busniess perspective, having a single enterprise platform is not uncommon, so assuming the users are on IE is not a problem. However as more Macs get introduced, bridging the gap to make these intranet web apps browser agnostic can be quite a difference in development time.p  pI was wondering if ASP.NET MVC has a leg up on this issue. I know it does not solve the Windows Authentican issue chime in on this as well for solutions, but I was wondering since server controls were not being used like with web forms, if using MVC was the advantageous choice when trying to make web applications cross browser compatible I dont mind doing MVC as opposed to webforms, and if there is documented or gained knowledge on why MVC works better for cross browser use, then speak to it. If experience shows the way that MVC renders its controls as opposed to server controls from webforms is better across different browsers, this is mainly what I am trying to detmine.p  pDoes anyone know about this Thanksp

However when you take a picture of some grass when the sun is shining the app detects more green then you take one in the shadow, but in real, their is the same amount of green grass.p  pAnd with the tool in photoshop autocolor it manipulates the sun really good, after few pictures tests the autocolor does it better then when I do it manually, so that is the reason I want to try to get this tool on the android somehow.p  pI didnt tried to implement autocolor in the android yet because I just dont if their is something like that. I now have 2 pictures taken at same time, 1 in shadow and 1 in the sun and I try to manipulate the one that I took in the sun, so it looks like the one taking in the shadow. So it gives almost the same amount of  green with my green scanner app.p  pPS, Mine Internet connection goes down now for few minutes, so I maybe wont see this post answers rightawayp

Negative 69458 pIm experiencing a bug with my code when used on mobile devices issue does not happen with the faster processing time of PCs. I suspect that the issue that Im having is to do with functions not firing sequentially  ie they will still go ahead, even if all the parameters are not set.p  pThe basic premise is that JQuery Geolocation is called, and the latitudelongitude data is used in conjunction with a parameter passed via an onClick function. This is then passed into AJAX that comes back with results based off this data.p  pDuring testing on mobile devices, however, sometimes when you click on links, the GPS wont fire in time, but it will still go ahead.

Negative 69458 pIt seems obvious that when implementing a generalpurpose text editor by general purpose I mean for example that it does not have to be able to handle huge files over 100200 MB which is still a lot, and is more like an extreme example of general case, it is not feasible to just store the text in one continuous long buffer, because performance is going to suck on insertionsdeletions.p  pWhile there are a number of ways to tackle this, they all revolve around the fact that you have to split the text up into chunks, and so my question is considering todays computer power, what would be the optimal chunk size What is the actual size of a text buffer that is practically starts to get too big for storing in a simple continuous buffer How fast are contemporary computers at moving big chunks of bytes around For the sake of clarity lets just say that gap buffers cant be used, each chunk will be a simple continuous array.p

Negative 69458 pI have a large Python dictionary of vectors 150k vectors, 10k dimensions each of float numbers that cant be loaded into memory, so I have to use one of the two methods for storing this on disk and retrieving specific vectors when appropriate. The vectors will be created and stored once, but might be read many thousands of times  so it is really important to have efficient reading.

For example, are there any other options except of those two that Im not aware ofp  pNow, assuming we agree that the best option is sqlite, another question relates to the exact form of the table.

Negative 69458 pI want to organize a collection of C header files in a way that it is easy for me and others to include them in other projects. It should also be easy to merge changes in those projects to the original files.br For now, I have about 30 header files, about 20 files with unit tests and about 15 files with usage examples which are partly referenced in the Doxygen documentation.

Negative 69458 pemAs I spend most of my time with php and mysql or pgsql, I will use DateTime as a generic word for the date API. In php there is no Date, Time, DateTime and DateTimeOffsetemp  pAs I develop web application more and more elaborate, I use DateTime most of time, but sometimes I wonder if it is really what I want. for example it happens that I just want to display the todays date for example when I want to store a forum or blog post, there is no calculation, no filter to provide, no iteration to happen... So why do I use codeDateTimecode over the codedatecode functionp  pI saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2218732whataregoodreasonstochoosetimestampoverdatetimecolumnsinmysqlthis topica that provides some simple description of the pros of each technologies.p  pBut it does not really answer to the question. Is it really a loss to throw up 2 more bytes in a DateTime object in PHP and other 2 bytes in my database as it allows me to use the codeDATEINTERVALcode API in php it is codeDateIntervalcode and the IntlDateFormatter.p  pMoreover, this post says that unixtimestamp is reserved from 1970.

Negative 69458 pI have a visual studio extension project which uses some external library. More over that library uses another library which must be placed in the same folder with the exe file. in our case it is Visual Studio folder. Folder where Visual Studio was installed. So how I can deploy my vsix file Exists there any ability to copy some external libriries in the Visual Studio folder or notp  pFirst idea is to copy library dll in the first of the extension.

But two more simple doubtsstrongbr 1 For codepcode case object is a string literal which one cant modifiable i.e. it is the property of right hand side object , while for q on RHS I have the same thing but now it is behaving differently. Why such an inconsistent design.br 2 For p if I modify the string literal, the behavior is undefined i.e. Sometimes it is modified and sometimes not. Again why such design. Actually for out of bound array access this is understandable as you access memory that you havent allocated before, and sometimes you dont have permission to access that piece of memory so, segmentation fault. But why sometimes I can modify string literal. Why so. What is the reason behind this.p
Negative 69458 pI am copying a large number of files during an ftp session from a remote host to my local machine.  I need to save the files in a local directory tree.  My problem is that a particular directory may not exist before the session.  The way I have handled this in the past is to do set up my script by first creating the directory tree and not even worrying if the directory exists and then from within the same batch file I create the batch file using Python I start my session and use lcd to change to the correct directoryp  precodemd c123 md c234 md c2342009 loginname password cd remotedirectory lcd c123 get somefile.txt codepre  pSo all of the above is written out to one batch file and I start it to run.  If the directory exists when I try to create it then I see a message in the terminal window that the directory exists and since nothing bad happens I have not worried about it.p  pWhat I would really like to do is check the existence of the local directory when I am ready to move to that directory and if it does not exist it gets created but I have not found out how to do this without closing the session and restarting it so I go back to the shell.  p  pIs there a way to do this during the ftp session while maintaining the connection with the host  p

Negative 69458 pI have an application that needs to wait for a background worker to finish before moving on. The background worker is in charge of writing some values to a USB device that initializes it.

The progress bar does strongnotstrong reflect how far along the background worker is, it merely spins.p  pI have read a few questions that say not to use a background worker, because I really dont want it to run asynchronously which is true, however, without using a background worker, my please wait dialog blocks and doesnt show the animation. I have also read a lot that tells me to only use one UI thread, which then supports the use of a background worker.p  pI have also tried to put the please wait spinner in a separate thread, but that introduces complexities and strange race conditions where the please wait windows tries to close before it has opened.p  pWhat is the right way to go about thisp

Negative 69458 pBelow I have 5 php scripts going in order from when user logs in to when user logs out. Now what I am doing at the moment is that I am using codeSESSIONcode to determine which user is logged in and then using the sessiongcmaxlife to add extra time so that the session does not expire for 12 hours. So that means the user can stay logged in for 12 hours for which after that amount of time it will log the user out automatically. This is just a very basic why of producing a login system.p  pBut what I want to do is be able to keep the user logged in for unlimited amount of time until they have either clicked on the logout link or have closed down the browser.

Negative 69458 pAccording to Apples documentation and touted at WWDC 2012, it is possible to set the layout on codeUICollectionViewcode dynamically and even animate the changesp  blockquote   pYou normally specify a layout object when creating a collection view but you can also change the layout of a collection view dynamically. The layout object is stored in the collectionViewLayout property. Setting this property directly updates the layout immediately, without animating the changes. If you want to animate the changes, you must call the setCollectionViewLayoutanimated method instead.p blockquote  pHowever, in practice, Ive found that codeUICollectionViewcode makes inexplicable and even invalid changes to the codecontentOffsetcode, causing cells to move incorrectly, making the feature virtually unusable. To illustrate the problem, I put together the following sample code that can be attached to a default collection view controller dropped into a storyboardp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  interface MyCollectionViewController  UICollectionViewController end  implementation MyCollectionViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     [self.collectionView registerClass[UICollectionViewCell class] forCellWithReuseIdentifierCELL]     self.collectionView.collectionViewLayout  [[UICollectionViewFlowLayout alloc] init]    NSIntegercollectionViewUICollectionView collectionView numberOfItemsInSectionNSIntegersection      return 1    UICollectionViewCell collectionViewUICollectionView collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UICollectionViewCell cell  [self.collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifierCELL forIndexPathindexPath]     cell.backgroundColor  [UIColor whiteColor]     return cell    voidcollectionViewUICollectionView collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      NSLogcontentOffsetf, f, self.collectionView.contentOffset.x, self.collectionView.contentOffset.y     [self.collectionView setCollectionViewLayout[[UICollectionViewFlowLayout alloc] init] animatedYES]     NSLogcontentOffsetf, f, self.collectionView.contentOffset.x, self.collectionView.contentOffset.y   end codepre  pThe controller sets a default codeUICollectionViewFlowLayoutcode in codeviewDidLoadcode and displays a single cell onscreen. When the cells is selected, the controller creates another default codeUICollectionViewFlowLayoutcode and sets it on the collection view with the codeanimatedYEScode flag. The expected behavior is that the cell does not move. The actual behavior, however, is that the cell scroll offscreen, at which point it is not even possible to scroll the cell back onscreen.p  pLooking at the console log reveals that the contentOffset has inexplicably changed in my project, from 0, 0 to 0, 205. I posted a solution for the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13716825settinganewcollectionviewlayoutforuicollectionviewgivingblankscreen1377536413775364solution for the nonanimated casea codei.e. animatedNOcode, but since I need animation, Im very interested to know if anyone has a solution or workaround for the animated case.p  pAs a sidenote, Ive tested custom layouts and get the same behavior.p

What I have and have seen for geocoding are very similar to Googles main example which I have pasted here. p  precodefunction codeAddress      var address  document.getElementByIdaddress.value     geocoder.geocode  address address, functionresults, status        if status  google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK          map.setCenterresults[0].geometry.location         var marker  new google.maps.Marker             map map,             position results[0].geometry.location                 else          alertGeocode was not successful for the following reason   status                codepre  pAs you can see it is just going off of address, I cant do this for my application as some of my addresses are really vague and will come back with numerous results just wondering if anyone has figured out how to do thisp  pI searched the forums here and found some similar questions but no real answers.  Any commentsadvice are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 69458 pIve been reading a variety of references that discuss the use of bottomhalf work queues for deferred processing in linux drivers.  From what I glean, it seems like any work done by kernel work queues gets scheduled just like ordinary user processesthreads and that the only real difference between a kernel work queuerelated process and a user process is that the work queue can move data between userside buffers and kernel buffers. I would appreciate knowing if my interpretation of these references is correct, or whether there are mechanisms by which I can maintain some degree of control over the priority of work queue processing. More specifically, Id like to know if I can guarantee that a work queue process has higher priority than any user process, at least when the work queue process is not sleeping. Im asking this question in the context of handling readswrites fromto chips hanging off a 400 kHz i.e. slow I2C bus. Were running linux 2.6.10 on an ARM9 processor.  Thanks p

Negative 69458 pTheres an application that needs to send messages to a bunch of clients. The clients are applications on users computers, and those applications sometimes run days at a time. The server either has new instructions, or it doesnt. Sometimes theres 10 minutes between two new instructions, sometimes an hour, sometimes a day. The messages are of fixed length. p  pWhat is the best way to implement this Should I have the clients poll the server every 10 seconds Should I create a new thread on the server everytime a new client connects, and keep the connection on until theres a new instruction, and then send that to the client and have the client create a new connectionp  pOr should I push the messages to the clients I was thinking about how to do that, and I came up with this The server server as both a server and a client. When a client handshakes, it gives its address to the server. The server then starts acting as a clientand as a server to enable other clients to connect, obviously, and keeps a connection with the clients. The clients act like servers, and wait for a message. p  pThe last one does seem rather complicated. What is the best way to do this New messagesinstructions from the server should arrive at the client at least 15 seconds after the server has them. p  pThe serverapplication is going to run on Windows by the way. Of the clients Im not sure, but lets assume multiplatform. Both the server and the client applications are written in Python.p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 69458 pI have been trying to get a twitter search to work using NSJSONSerialization to parse the query results.  I originally used a tutorial on accessing Twitter data using an SLRequest, but Ive found that in doing this I need the results to update a property in order to save them. I want the fetching to be a class method, so Im avoiding using properties. The issue Im running into is a bit weird and Im not sure why it would be happening. Basically I can get the fetch with [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData ...] reliably  except for one keyvalue pair in the dictionary, the results. The value for the key results is returning as  , and is type NSArrayM. I can see that the URL I am sending to fetch the data is correct, and that the rest of the information in the parsed dictionary is correct. Im not sure why this would be occurring though.p  pHere is an example GET request a hrefhttpssearch.twitter.comsearch.jsonqtech20filter3Alinks20lang3Aenampsrctypdamprpp1ampincludeentitiestrue relnofollowhttpssearch.twitter.comsearch.jsonqtech20filter3Alinks20lang3Aenampsrctypdamprpp1ampincludeentitiestrueap  pIf you go to that page, you can see that the results key has a value associated with it, and it should be an array.

Negative 69458 pI have a clientserver program written in C for windows which I nearly done integrating OpenSSL into.p  pI do want to state that I have looked over all the other posts similar to my own, and I have not yet found the correct answer to my problem.  Most of the other exmaples are very close to the answer, but I cannot seem to produce the actual result.p  pFor my test case I am simply passing a string of 7 characters from the client to the server using OpenSSL secure sockets every 5 seconds.  I am not sending any other information.  The original problem was that I was not using SSLread correctly and I was not reading in the apparent extra data that was needed, and the SSLread would stop responding and the client would lose connection.p  pAfter reading all of the other examples I got a couple steps further to accomplishing this, but I could never get the desired result.  I have attempted over 10 types of SSLread implementations and I cannot get the code to be nonblocking while reading data.  I will post my latest implementation not incredibly optimizedp  precodeint received  1 int tE  0      if tE  SSLERRORWANTREAD ampamp tE  SSLERRORWANTWRITE               received  SSLreadsSecureSocket.ssl, buffer, sizeofbuffer          if received  1                       tE  SSLgeterror sSecureSocket.ssl, received              if tE  SSLERRORWANTREAD                               int tReadWaiting  1                 while tReadWaiting                                       tReadWaiting  0                     fdset rfd                     FDZEROamprfd                     FDSETreceiveSocket, amprfd                     timeval tv   0                      selectreceiveSocket1, amprfd, 0, 0, amptv                     if FDISSETreceiveSocket, amprfd                                              tReadWaiting  1                                                       received  SSLreadsSecureSocket.ssl, buffer, sizeofbuffer                             codepre  pThis code does successfully extract the packet every time it is sent, however as you can see I must use the select statement once the SSLERRORWANTREADWRITE is triggered.  This approach was taken from another thread of this forum, say that you are supposed to read UNTIL the SSLERRORWANTREADWRITER are called.  Also, I do use SSLpending but it always returns 0 in every case I have, never is it a nonzero number.p  pThe program is written with nonblocking sockets with WSAASyncSelect calls to windows messages.  All of that works fine.p  pBut what happens is the opposite of what I expect.  The code seems to always wait for data which is non existent.  I realize the the SSL sockets are meant to do handshakes at random times as well.  I am just trying to figure out why once I have received that the data from the server, why it seems that SSLread seems to have data, or select detects data needs to be be read in between the 5 second intervals in which I send my packet so that the select loop blocks for the whole time.  Even once the packet is completely read, the next message is called back into the read function and the program itself can never leave this function to do any other processes.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, Ive never been at my wits end programming before, this is bringing me very close to it.  p  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pThis is the socket listening codep  precodectx  sSecureSocket.InitServerCTX         initialize SSL      sSecureSocket.LoadCertificatesctx, VGlobalCURRWORKDIR  openssl2  mycert.pem, VGlobalCURRWORKDIR  openssl2  mycert.pem  load certs      servSecureSocket  sSecureSocket.OpenListener39245     create server socket  codepre  pThis is called when the socket is accepted on the serverp  precodeAlways connect as a secure socket first struct sockaddrin addr socklent len  sizeofaddr SSL ssl  receiveSocket  acceptservSecureSocket, struct sockaddrampaddr, amplen   accept connection as usual  printfConnection sdn,inetntoaaddr.sinaddr, ntohsaddr.sinport sSecureSocket.ssl  SSLnewctx               get new SSL state with context  SSLsetfdsSecureSocket.ssl, receiveSocket       set connection socket to SSL state  sSecureSocket.ServletsSecureSocket.ssl          service connection  codepre  pThese are the functionsp  precode int SecureSocketOpenListenerint port    int sd struct sockaddrin addr  WSADATA wsadata int error  WSAStartup 0x0202, ampwsadata   if error      return false  sd  socketPFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0 bzeroampaddr, sizeofaddr memsetampaddr, 0, sizeofaddr addr.sinfamily  AFINET addr.sinport  htonsport addr.sinaddr.saddr  INADDRANY if  bindsd, struct sockaddrampaddr, sizeofaddr  0       perrorcant bind port     abort  if  listensd, 10  0       perrorCant configure listening port     abort  return sd    SSLCTX SecureSocketInitServerCTXvoid     SSLMETHOD method SSLCTX ctx  OpenSSLaddallalgorithms   load amp register all cryptos, etc.  SSLloaderrorstrings    load all error messages  ctx  SSLCTXnewSSLv23servermethod if  ctx  NULL       ERRprinterrorsfpstderr  return ctx    void SecureSocketLoadCertificatesSSLCTX ctx, CString CertFile, CString KeyFile   set the local certificate from CertFile  if  SSLCTXusecertificatefilectx, CertFile, SSLFILETYPEPEM lt 0       ERRprinterrorsfpstderr   set the private key from KeyFile may be the same as CertFile  if  SSLCTXusePrivateKeyfilectx, KeyFile, SSLFILETYPEPEM lt 0       ERRprinterrorsfpstderr   verify private key  if  SSLCTXcheckprivatekeyctx       fprintfstderr, Private key does not match the public certificaten     void SecureSocketShowCertsSSL ssl    X509 cert char line  cert  SSLgetpeercertificatessl  Get certificates if available  if  cert  NULL       printfServer certificatesn     line  X509NAMEonelineX509getsubjectnamecert, 0, 0     printfSubject sn, line     freeline     line  X509NAMEonelineX509getissuernamecert, 0, 0     printfIssuer sn, line     freeline     X509freecert  else     printfNo certificates.n    void SecureSocketServletSSL ssl  Serve the connection  threadable   int acceptDone  SSLacceptssl  If this blocking this will be done immediately, if it is not we must loop until it is complete while acceptDone lt 1       acceptDone  SSLacceptssl   ShowCertsssl         get any certificates   codepre

In the demo , the file MO.glsm is made up of two MeshObjects translated from TGLExtrusionSolid Object.p  h2Thanks in advance for any suggestion.h2  pThanks all. The problem was solved. The Answer as follow   The function CalcPlaneNormal in VectorGeometry.pas returns an incorrect Normal, bcoz Vertexs value is very large as above. E.g, the normal would be 13119570882.098259961 calculated by CalcPlaneNormal, and the rounding issue would happen here...   so I translated the big coordinate value to a small coordinate value. And the exception has gone.   p

Negative 69458 pI am having some memory issues with our android app when handling bitmaps duh.p  pWe are having multiple activities loading images from a server, this could be a background image for the activity. This background image could be the same for multiple activities, and right now each activity is loading its own background image.  This means if the flow is ac1ac2ac3ac4 the same image will be loaded 4 times and using 4x memory.p  pHow do I optimize imagehandling for this scenario Do I create an image cache where the image is stored and then each activity ask the cache first for images. If this is the case, how do I know when to garbage collect the image from the cachep  pAny suggestions, link to good tutorials or similar is highly appreciated.p  pRegardsp  pEDIT When downloading images for the device the exact sizes is used, meaning that if the ui element needs an 100x100 pixel image it gets that size and therefore no need for scaling. So i am not sure about downscaling the image when loading it into the memory. Maybe it is needed to unload images in the activity when moving on the the next and then reload when going back.p

Negative 69458 pI have usually been able to find an answer to my query without asking a question and I wanted to say thank you to everyone for that.  But I do have a question that Im hoping someone can help with.p  pIs there a way to rename pictures in a folder where the image names are reflected in Column A for each image in the folder, to a new name that would be reflected in Column B. For instance, if cell A2 contained the original image file name Picasso1.jpg and cell B2 contained the new image file name desired 12T.jpg would it be possible to search through the folder find Picasso1.jpg and rename it 12T.jpg I need to do this for over 3000 images on a weekly basis.  Is there a way to loop through the the spreadsheet finding each image file in the folder and renaming it its new name reflected in Column A.p

Negative 69458 pIm having trouble understanding the complexities of Lucene. Any help would be appreciated.p  pWere using a Windows Azure blob to store our Lucene index, with Lucene.Net and AzureDirectory. A WorkerRole contains the only IndexWriter, and it adds 20,000 or more records a day, and changes a small number fewer than 100 of the existing documents. A WebRole on a different box is set up to take two snapshots of the index into another AzureDirectory, alternating between the two, and telling the WebService which directory to use as it becomes available.p  pThe WebService has two IndexSearchers that alternate, reloading as the next snapshot is readyone IndexSearcher is supposed to handle all client requests at a time until the newer snapshot is ready. The IndexSearcher sometimes takes a long time minutes to instantiate, and other times its very fast a few seconds. Since the directory is physically on disk already not using the blob at this stage, we expected it to be a fast operation, so this is one confusing point.p  pWere currently up around 8 million records. The Lucene search used to be so fast it was great, but now its very slow. To try to improve this, weve started to IndexWriter.Optimize the index once a day after we back it upsome resources online indicated that Optimize is not required for oftenchanging indexes, but other resources indicate that optimization is required, so were not sure.p  pThe big problem is that whenever our web site has more traffic than a single user, were getting timeouts on the Lucene search. Were trying to figure out if theres a bottleneck at the IndexSearcher object. Its supposed to be threadsafe, but it seems like something is blocking the requests so that only a single search is performed at a time. The box is an Azure VM, set to a Medium size so it has lots of resources available.p  pThanks for whatever insight you can provide. Obviously, I can provide more detail if you have any further questions, but I think this is a good start.p

Negative 69458 pI am beginner to Java, so I am learning through experimentation. I wanted to create a class where it would take a type of ride as a String and number of riders as an Integer. I decided to use Map because it would allow me to keep together a ride type with its pertinent  of individuals.p  precodeHow many attendants in total System.out.printlnHow many attendents today  int numberOfAttendents  Integer.parseIntbf.readLine System.out.printlnTotal number of attendents   numberOfAttendents  MapltString, Integergt typeOfRide  new HashMapltString, Integergt boolean run  true final String counterEnd  stop whilerun     System.out.printlnWhat type of ride     String nameOfType  bf.readLine    ifnameOfType.equalsIgnoreCasecounterEnd           run  false        else          System.out.printlnNumber of riders       Integer numberPerType     Integer.parseIntbf.readLine                      typeOfRide.putnameOfType, numberPerType           codepre  pSo the above part compiles with no problem. However when I try to add the number of riders per ride type, I am having some difficulty try to come up with a way. I understand the enhanced for loop I used is for arrays and not for map.p  precode Adding individual entries of same ride    forInteger i typeOfRide           int sum  0       System.out.printlnWhich ride type        String typeNumber  bf.readLine       sum  sum  typeOfRide.gettypeNumber       System.out.printlnTotal number of riders per  typeNumber    sum      codepre  pSo if yall can suggest a method to get the sum, I would appreciate.

Negative 69458 pIm trying to write some java codes getting locations from address. not in android environment.p  pIf possible, I want it to be permanent way as long as Google provides geolocation services in somehow.p  pI think I cannot say Google javascript geolocation apis uses permanent URL to do that, since the apis Object is to come from Google server at runtime.p  pHowever I think it seems to be possible that Android might use a permanent URL to do that since Google is not able to change every devices URLs through which devices get the geolocation services.p  pAm I wrong Is there any addressed Google policy concerning itp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 69458 pIm trying to center my checkboxes in a codeTableLayoutPanelcode, but they always end up looking leftaligned due to the nature of the checkbox control. See picture belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjEeiL.png altTable Layout Picturep  pI want each rows checks to be leftaligned, but for it to appear more centered. Something like the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY6TB7.png altTable Layout Centeredp  pIve checked around online, and I can center the checkboxes by setting codeAnchorStyles.Nonecode which is not what I want, because then the checkboxes are not aligned. I have them set to codeDock.Fillcode so you can click anywhere in the cell to activate the checkbox.p  pIm currently just padding my table to achieve a similar effect, but its by far not an acceptable solution longterm. Also, padding the cells will line break the checkbox text without taking up all the available space on the row since some of the row is being eaten by padding. The same goes for using a spacercell on the left of the table, not an ideal solution. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas Thanksp
Negative 69458 pI have a wxpython grid sizer that is sizing sublists of bitmap buttons. The master list I would like to create just once because creating these buttons takes a considerable amount of time, and thus I do not want to destroy them.  My idea is to somehow remove all of the buttons from the sizer, make a new list of the buttons that I want the sizer to contain, and then use the sizers AddMany method.p  pIf I cant remove the buttons from the sizer without destroying them, then is there a way to use the sizers Show method to hide some of the times, but then have the sizer adjust to fill in the gaps  When I hide them, all I can get them to do right now is just to have them disappear and leave a gap.  I need the next item to be adjusted to the gaps place.p  pAlso is there a way to sort the grid sizers item listp  pThanks for any help you can offer.p

Negative 69458 pI noticed that for an account A, the codelastTransactionDatecode is the date such that all transactions happen before that are available through codegetAccountTransactionscode. Its strongemNOTemstrong the date such that strongemONLYemstrong all transactions happen before that are taken into account when calculating the balance of account A because some transactions happen after codelastTransactionDatecode have to be taken into account to yield the correct balance. Can someone confirm my observationp  pAnother thing is that some transactions that happen on the same date as codebalanceDatecode with the exact time being AFTER the time of codebalanceDatecode are taken into account as well to yield the accounts balance. For example, codebalanceAmountcode  7682.16, codebalanceDatecode  20130806 125321  0700 but the transaction with codepostedDatecode  20130806 164941  0700 is included. Does this mean we should only care about the date portion of codebalanceDatecode and that codebalanceDatecode of 20130806 125321  0700 includes all transactions posted on 20130806p

This will make the images representing the top and bottom of the table responsive. p  pBut for the rest of the content table where height needs to be variable depending on the quantity of the content, how should I create such borders with shadows without CSS3 p  pOne idea is that I could create just a simple line border for old email clients so that the css3 shadows only work in new email clients, at least, but 95 of our audience uses Outlook 2007 or 2010. Those email clients do not support css3, so the entire effort would be lost. p  pAny ideas or pointers Especially for the running left and right shadow border. p  pThanks p

Negative 69458 pHi I have a question related to Androids account manager.. My app injects an account into it, thus it is accessible also by other apps installed on the device. I thought that once any app would ask the system for the data stored in the account, it should ask the user first the classic android auth screen, with two buttons which tells the user that the app wants access to the account. However, I tried it right now, I wrote simple app which purpose is only to populate stored authentication token from the account manager. It worked. It work just great except there wasnt any step asking the user for permission, it just shows the token.  Please how I need to configure the account to not be publicp  pBelow is the code I used for accessing the account. I only used the type of the account and type of the token.

Negative 69458 pIm trying to write a web application that allows logged in users to store passwords for different applications into a MySQL db. But to prevent MySQL admins from reading those passwords directly from the db, Id like to make those passwords unreadable before theyre send to the db. Then when the user wishes to look at his stored passwords the web application decrypts the stored passwords and shows them on screen.p  pIm trying to work out a method of encrypting those passwords for storage in the db and then decrypt them when read from the db.p  pSo, for example  The user wishes to store a new password Abc123  The web application then transforms the given password into gibberish 234fohj234]j8924] or something similar and stores it into the db.  When the user opens the web application to look at his stored passwords, he sees the correct password Abc123  But when an MySQL admin uses a program like PHPMyAdmin to view  maintain the database, he will only see the gibberish password, not the real one.p  pDoes PHP or MySQL offer a buildin function for something like this Or does anyone have any tips on creating a function to accomplish thisp

Negative 69458 pI am writing a django app to manage the static content on my page so that the end user can update content throughout without having to change the code server side. Part of this means keeping track of which sections have customized definitions. Thus, these sections are one of my models for the app. The issue is that I want to limit the choices about which sections can be customized.p  pHere is what a section will be like thenp  precodefrom django.db import models   Create your models here.

But, for now the issue is that even though the codeStaticItemcode model has a unique field determined by those choices, all of the choices appear in the admin panel drop down when creating a new codeStaticItemcode. While they appear as choices, django prevents the user from creating a codeStaticItemcode whose location is already used by another. My question then is how to only display the options from codeCHOICEScode which have not been used by a codeStaticItemcode yet. Basically, there must be a 1 to 1 relationship between the two, but Im running into issues because I dont want to make CHOICES a model.p

Negative 69458 pIm trying to use Google Analytics and Contents Experiments to set up AB testing on my website but Im having trouble getting it to appear seamless.p  pThere are a few things that need to happen in order to use the google API. First I add a script tag to load the cxApi from Google, specifying an experiment id. After it has loaded the google docs suggest putting a listener on window for the load event after which point you should ask google for a variation of the content you wish to display and give it a callback. Once it has selected a variation you can then use javascript to showhide the relevant content.p  pThe issue though is that I get content flash on page load if I am AB testing a H2 for example, I dont want to see the original one first and then see it quickly replaced. Does anyone have any tipsp  pThe best solution Ive come up with so far would be adding a style tag to hide the relevant content by setting the text color to transparent for example, so the content still takes up the same amount of space on the screen and doesnt cause reflow but Im after a better solution and would be interested if anyone might have any insight into how optimizely do thisp  pCheersp

Negative 69458 pI have a Delphi ActiveX project with 4 interfaces. Two of them have AutoComObject factories for their CoClasses. All the methods of the interfaces are declared with safecalls. In the interfaces with the factories, if a exception is thrown in any method,  the caller receives an EOleException with the exception message from the original exception in the activex. But in the other two interfaces any exception gets masked as EOleException with the message masked to Catastrophic Failure.p  pAnyone knows why this is happening, and how to make the original exception message not get maskedp
Negative 69458 pI have an app that posts to my server using Jquery Ajax and receives and displays HTML data on the page. Its a pretty simple JQuery call as suchp  precodefunction LoadStatsisUpdate      .ajax         cache false,         url url,         data              someData, removed for SF         ,         success function data              statsBox.htmldata                codepre  pWhat Im trying to do is get a simple Google Chart to display in this box. The javascript does not seem to display correctly though when I do this. I am using the basic example from Google Charts like the following in a MVC Viewp  precodeltdivgtHTML Here. Helloltdivgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          google.loadvisualization, 1, packages[corechart]         google.setOnLoadCallbackdrawChart         function drawChart              var data  google.visualization.arrayToDataTable[               [Year, Sales],               [2004,  1000     ],               [2005,  1170     ],               [2006,  660       ],               [2007,  1030      ]             ]              var options                   title Company Performance,                 vAxis title Year,  titleTextStyle color red                           var chart  new google.visualization.BarChartdocument.getElementByIdstatsBox             chart.drawdata, options           ltscriptgt codepre  pMy initial attempt included putting the reference to google.comjsapi script in the view itself, and that gave me an error that Google was not defined. So I put the reference to the API in the header of my page, which got rid of the error but now when it loads, it blanks out the screen. No errors, just a white blank page.p  pKeep in mind once I actually get the chart to work I will be populating it with data from the server, hence the reason I dont just put it in the page itself. What am I missing here I have a feeling it has something to do with the setOnLoadCallback, since Im using a jquery post to load up data theres got to be some other setting I need to set in order to display this.p

However, after looking at the CDECL calling convention, that would not make sense, as codeSPcode is assigned to the value of codeBPcode.

And at the same time an android device can be made act as an A2DP sink by modifying the audio.conf file inside the same.p  pI also came to know that from android 4.2 onwards, the BlueZ stack was replaced by Broadcoms Bluedroid stack. I searched a lot about Bluedroid stack. But i was not able to find much details about the same.p  pHope someone can help me with the following doubts.p  p1. Whether Bluedroid have A2DP sink supportp  p2. Whether the audio.conf file will be available for devices having bluedroid stackp  p3. I am going to write an A2DP sink support for an android device by directly calling APIs of BlueZ stack. But my final question is whether the same can be used with Bluedroid stack also Hope Bluedroid is just an expansion of BlueZ.p  pPlease help.p

Negative 69458 pWe are one of the Openstack cloud user and use Swift to store lots of files in cloud. And our users the endusers will access these files. If the files are public, then the endusers can directly visit the object URL in web or mobile applications. However, some of files are private. Each enduser can only access his own private files.p  pThe enduser may have two methods to access his private filesp  blockquote   pA. The enduser always sends requests to our server. And our server will get the files from Swift, and then send them to the user. In this   method, Our server can be regarded as a file proxy. We have the   authentication of Openstack, and the user has the authentication of   our server. We should maintain our own user system. p      pOne problem of this method is the scalability. Because each request   will be sent to our server, then the server will be the bottleneck if   many files are uploading or downloading at the same time. The high   scalability feature of Swift cant be used if we dont have enough   servers. Actually we really dont need lots of servers except file   transferring.p      pB. The enduser directly sends requests to Swift. It may solve the huge file bandwidth problem. But he must have the authentication   method of Openstack. So we need thousands of Openstack accounts for   our users while we are only one of the user of Openstack It seems   strange and is not feasible.p blockquote  pAre there any other methods to meet the requirementp

Negative 69458 pJust read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5515310isthereastandardfunctiontocheckfornullundefinedorblankvariablesinlq1this highlyrelated questiona, and then reflected on what I was using in my own code base for a project at work.p  pI wrote a simple function to demonstrate this question using Google Apps Script, thus the calls to codeLogger.logcodep  precodefunction emptyValueTest     var object       prop1 realdata,     prop2 ,     prop3 undefined,     prop4 null        What I have used in my code personally. All evaluate to TRUE   if object.prop2   Logger.logprop2 was empty   if typeof object.prop3  undefined Logger.logprop3 was undefined   if object.prop4  null Logger.logprop4 was null     The other solution Ive seen. All evaluate to FALSE   if object.prop2 Logger.logprop2 was empty   if object.prop3 Logger.logprop3 was undefined   if object.prop4 Logger.logprop4 was null  codepre  pIve been building a system for the past few months with thousands of lines of code, and I often find myself backtracking when I see a particular value, to remember what its previous state was before a particular conditional expression.p  pSince Im the one writing the code it isnt too difficult for me to figure it out, because I know the structure of the data, the values that are supposed to be there, etc.p  pHowever, this system will be taken over by another developer after I graduate from my university, so I wonder what the best practice is for emrepresentingem that a property emhas no dataem.p  pFor example, my use case is that I have codeeventcode Objects which are initialized with empty data and, during the lifetime of a semester, are eventually filled with real data. Personally I use codeundefinedcode because it makes more sense to me to read codeif typeof data  undefinedcode, having a similar semantic meaning to if this data is undefined i.e. no value emyetem.p  pBut I wonder, in industry, in libraries, and in personal projects, what are commonlyused methods to make code more readable, understandable Though the length of the first three conditionals is longer than the latter three, I find the latter three to be emambiguousem.p  pFor example, codeprop2code could have a strongnonemptystrong string like codedatacode, or the value codetruecode, which would cause the latter conditional codeif object.prop2code to evaluate to codetruecode in strongbothstrong cases, because everything in JavaScript is emtruthyem except the followingp  ul linullli liundefinedli liNaNli liempty string li li0li lifalseli ul  pAnd it is entirely possible that data could have codecode, code0code, and codefalsecode as valid values, whereas codenullcode, codeundefinedcode and especially codeNaNcode are probably not typical values for real data.p  pObviously I we know the structure of the data then we might impose more strict checks to disambiguate emnonemptyem strings from emtrueem. But in a project with thousands of lines of code it seems to me that this gets out of hand fast, especially if the structure of the data changes over time.p  pstrongSo my questionstrong Is there a preferred method of emrepresenting strongemptystrong values in Javascriptem And is there a particular reason for the preference performance, readability, scalability, etc.p

Negative 69458 pIs the notionconcept of strongimmediate eventsstrong something that exists in Javascript implementationsp  h2Backgroundh2  pIn this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma27343111711186this answera to the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq27340251711186Is javascript guaranteed to be singlethreadeda the auther mentions something he refers to as strongimmediate eventsstrong. Such an strongimmediate eventstrong is a callback function i.e. to something like the resize of the browser window codewindow.onresize  callbackfunccode , which is executed while some other  Javascript code has not yet finished, because for instace it is blocked i.e. codealertalertcode. p  pLet me clarify with an examplep  precode 1 Setup a immediate event a callback for resize window.onresize  function console.loglog resize    2 Run some code which contains a blocking alert console.loglog A console.loglog B alertalert console.loglog C codepre  pAs a jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netrj25m5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netrj25m5a  p  pOutputs of the script above for different casesscenariop  pCase 1 No resizing takes placep  pre log A log B log C pre  pCase 2 Windows is resized after codealertalertcodep  pre log A log B log C log resize pre  pCase 3 stronginteresting casestrong Windows is resized during the codealertalertcode popupp  pre log A log B log resize log C pre  pNOTICE Please observe as mentioned also in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma27343111711186answera mentioned, that on some systems it is not easy to resize the window during there is a modal alert. In MS Windows for instance one needs to temparily reduced the screen revolution to provoke the resize of the window. In other system, most linux, event though there is a alert you can still resize the window. p  pNOTICE 2 The Case 3 output I was only able to reproduce in Firefox used the 26.0 version. IE and Chrome did not seem to support those strongimmediate eventsstrong and it seems that there the resize event was noticed but scheduled to run after the completion of the block which was blocked by the codealertalertcode. p  pCase 4 like Case3, but with ChromeIEp  pre log A log B log C log resize pre  pI am confused about the behaviour observed in the Firefox build and the usage of the term immediate events. I have my doubts if something like this actually exists. This is why I ask here, I expect that somebody is familiar and can answer with reference to the specs of ECMAScript and or reference to the specs of implementations. Looking at the MDN reference to the actual idea of a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptGuideEventLoop.22Runtocompletion.22 relnofollowrun to completiona I am inclined to think that the behaviour descriped by strongimmediate eventsstrong is nothing desired, nothing named and actuallye a Firefox bug. There is some reputation that firefox has some troubles with the codealertcode since they introduced the new tab modal alert.p  pI am happy for insight and open to answer commentsp
Negative 69458 pIm trying to implement a friending system in Ember, which is a manytomany relationship.

I dont want this to happen, because for a bidirectional friending system, the codemodel.friendshipcode array should contain the inverse of codefriendshipcode i.e. with user and friend swapped.  Of course it would be nice if Ember had a way to do this automatically, but Im perfectly happy to do it manually as well.p  pFor now, why is the codepushObjectcode method pushing the same codefriendshipcode record into both user records  I guess it might have something to do with the way inverses are defined in the models.  I tried changing to codeinverse nullcode but that did not solve the problem.  What is happening under the hood with emberdata that is causing this behavior  Or is there a bug in my code somewhere that I have not seen  Any way to get rid of this behavior would be much appreciatedp

Negative 69458 pIm exploring the use of topics and events in WSO2 ESB 4.8.1, I created a topic and subscribed to it the endpoint of one dataservice running in WSO2 WSASA, I supposed that if I published a message with the structure defined for the incoming message of one of A operations in the publish tool of the Topic Details console, the message would be sent to the supscriptor A and everything where going to work fine, but it dont. Why I also create a proxy service with an event mediator and configured the event mediator with the name of the created topic. Then I Try the proxy service with an incoming message with the same structure explained before. I was expecting to at least get an incoming message in the WSAS Soap Tracer, but nothing happened. Am I missing somethingp

Negative 69458 pHow to use exactly 8 threads for the expensive parts all the timep  pI have a number crunching problem for which I created a simple framework. My problem is to find an elegant and simple way to use all CPU cores optimally.p  pTo get good performance I use a thread pool with fixed size of 8. The idea is to use as many threads as there are hardware threads for optimal performance. p  pSimplified pseudo code usage of the framework is as followsp  precodeinterface Task    data[] computedata[]   Task task  new Loopnew Chainnew DoX, new DoY, new Split2, new DoZ result  task.computedata codepre  ul liLoop Task would loop until some termination criteria is metli liChain Task would chain tasks e.g. in the above r  t1.computer r  t2.computer r  t3.computer return rli liSplit Task would split the data and execute a task on the parts e.g. create 2 parts and return new data[] t1.computepart1, t1.computepart2li ul  pThe threading is implemented in the Split Task at the moment. So the Split Task would hand the computation of t1.computepart1 and t1.computepart2 to the thread pool.p  h2Approach 1, probably complete deadlockh2  pMy first approach was that the Split Task has an array of futures and calls get on one after another. But that means if the Split Task is inside another Split Task, that the blocking wait in future.get will block the thread that the outer Split Task took from the thread pool. So I have less than 8 threads really working. If this hierarchy is deep, I maybe have nobody working and wait forever.p  pstrong1strong I assume future.get will not return the thread to the thread pool, right So if done like that I will wait in future.get but no more threads to ever start the work [I cannot easy test that because I already changed the approach]p  h2Approach 2, the current one, at least somebody workingh2  pMy current approach not much better is to do the final part partN of a split with the current thread. If finished I check if partN1 was already started, if yes I wait for all tasks in future.get otherwise current thread does partN1 too, and if needed partN2... So now I should always have at least one thread of the pool working.p  pBut since the answer to question 1 probably is that future.get will block my threads, with this approach I will have only few working threads on deep hierarchies.p  h2Approach 3, the only solution I seeh2  pI assume I must use 2 thread pools, one for the hard work and one for all the waiting. So I would have a fixed size thread pool for the hard work and a dynamic one for the waiting.p  p3.a. But that means that the Split Task must only spawn threads from the waiting pool and the Task doing real work will spawn a new thread from the work pool and wait for it to complete. Ugly, but should work. Ugly because at the moment the whole threading support is all in the Split Task, but with this solution other Tasks doing the hard work must know about threading.p  p3.b. Another approach would be that Split spawns worker threads, but inside split each waiting must be done by a waiting thread while the current thread also does worker thread tasks in the meantime. With this, all threading support is in Split Task class, but Im not sure how to implement that.p  pstrong2astrong How can I wait for the tasks without blocking the current threadp  pstrong2bstrong Can I return the current thread to the worker thread pool, let a waiter thread wait and then after waiting continue with the previous current thread or a thread from the worker pool Howp  h2Other solutionsh2  pDont use a fixed sized thread pool.p  pstrong3strong Is my idea to have 8 threads wrong But how many then if the hierarchies can be deep And isnt there the risk that the JVM starts many tasks in parallel and switches a lot between themp  pstrong4strong What do I miss or what would you do to solve that problemp  pThanks a lot and regardsp  hr  h2[EDIT]h2  h2Accepted Solution and why I try something different based on approach 2h2  pI accepted the ForkJoinPool as the correct solution.p  pHowever, some of the details and possible overhead and loss of control make me want to try another approach. But the more I think about it, the more I come back to using ForkJoinPool see Note at the end for the reason. Sorry for the amount of text.p  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilconcurrentForkJoinPool.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilconcurrentForkJoinPool.htmlap  pHowever, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of blocked IO or other unmanaged synchronization.p  pmaximum number of running threads to 32767p  pa hrefhttphomes.cs.washington.edudjgteachingMaterialsgrossmanSPACforkJoinFramework.html relnofollowhttphomes.cs.washington.edudjgteachingMaterialsgrossmanSPACforkJoinFramework.htmlap  pThe documentation for the ForkJoin framework suggests creating parallel subtasks until the number of basic computation steps is somewhere over 100 and less than 10,000.p  pThe hard work Tasks read a lot of data from disk and it is very far from 10,000 basic computations. Actually I could forkjoin it down to maybe acceptable levels, but this is too much work now because that part of the code is rather complex.p  pI think approach 3a is basically an implementation of ForkJoin, except that I would have more control and probably less overhead and the problems just mentioned above should not exist but no automatic adaption to CPU resources provided by OS, but I will force the OS to give me what I want if I have to.p  pI maybe try to use approach 2 with some changes that way I can work with an exact thread number and I dont have any waiting threads, ForkJoinPool seems to work with waiting threads if I understand it correctly.p  pCurrent thread does jobs until all jobs in this Split instance are being run by a worker thread so work stealing in Split node like previously, but then it will not call future.get, but just check if all futures are ready with future.isDone. If not all are done, it will steal a job from the thread pool and execute it, then it checks the futures again. That way I will never wait as long as there is a single job that is not running.p  pThe Ugly if there is no job to steal I would have to sleep for a short time and then check the futures again or steal a new job from the pool is there a way to wait for multiple Futures to all be complete with a timeout that will not cancel the computations if it triggersp  pSo I think I have to use a Completion Service for the ThreadPool in each Split Task, then I can poll using a timeout and do not need to sleep.p  pAssumption the ThreadPool in the Completion Service can still be used like a normal ThreadPool e.g. Job stealing. One ThreadPool can be in many Completion Services.p  pI think this is the optimal solution for the problem detailed in the question. However, there is a small problem with that, see the following.p  h2Noteh2  pAfter looking at the hard tasks again, I see that they can be parallelized for many of their instantiations. So adding threading there too is the next logical step. These are always leaf nodes and the work they do is optimally done with a completion service in some cases subjobs can have different runtimes but any 2 results can build a new job. To do them with the ForkJoinPool I would have to use managedBlock and implement ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker, which make the code more complex. However, at the same time the usage of CompletionService in these leave nodes means my approach 2 based solution will probably need waiting threads too, so I maybe better go with ForkJoinPool.p

Negative 69458 pAWS Alarms support three states OK, INSUFFICIENTDATA and ALARM. I have a metric that if data is ever received should produce an alarm. Thats easy enough. The problem is if no data is received that should be an all clear.

Negative 69458 pIm having some trouble making my SwipeRefreshLayout visible when using transparent navigation, and status bars API Level 19. That is to say, its currently under the status bar at the top of the screen, when I want it to be under the actionbar. p  pThe ListView is working as expected. That is, the content is properly shown behind the navigation bars, and does not get hidden under the status bar, or actionbar. p  pWith this being said, if I add the androidfitsSystemWindowstrue property to my relative layout, the SwipeRefreshLayout works properly. But, doing this makes my listview not visible under the transparent navigation bars. Instead, the navigation bars are simply the color of my background, and do not allow content from my listview to be shown under it.p  pHow can I get the ListView to stay how it is now, and also get my SwipeRefreshLayout to be visible instead of being hidden under the status bar, at the top of the screenp  pBelow is my layoutp  precodeltandroid.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout         xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid         xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools         androidididdrawerlayout         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparentgt          ltRelativeLayout             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightfillparent             androidpaddingTop10dp             androidbackgroundccc             androidclipToPaddingfalsegt              ltandroid.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout                 androidididswipecontainer                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt              ltFrameLayout                 androidididcontainer                 androidpaddingLeftdimenactivityhorizontalmargin                 androidpaddingRightdimenactivityhorizontalmargin                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightfillparent                 androidbackgroundcccgt                  ltListView                     androidlayoutwidthfillparent                     androidlayoutheightfillparent                     androidididlistView                     androidpaddingTop10dp                     androidfitsSystemWindowstrue                     androidclipToPaddingfalse                     androiddividerandroidcolortransparent                     androidlayoutgravitylefttop gt                  ltTextView                     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                     androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceLarge                     androidtextNo Internet Connection                     androidididnoInternet                     androidtextColorandroidcolorsecondarytextlight                     androidlayoutgravitycenter gt                  ltTextView                     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                     androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceMedium                     androidtextPull To Refresh                     androidtranslationY20dp                     androidididnointernetSub                     androidtextColorandroidcolorsecondarytextlight                     androidlayoutgravitycenter gt              ltFrameLayoutgt              ltandroid.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayoutgt          ltRelativeLayoutgt      ltfragment androidididnavigationdrawer         androidlayoutwidthdimennavigationdrawerwidth         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidlayoutgravitystart         androidnamecom.package.app.NavigationDrawerFragment         toolslayoutlayoutfragmentnavigationdrawer gt  ltandroid.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayoutgt codepre

Negative 69458 pIm working on a booking application, and in the backend, the user will be able to specify which days of the week he wants his venue available on. For instance, he might choose only to make his venue available on friday and saturday. p  pMy question is, how would I go about storing this data in the smartest wayp  pThe first thing that comes to mind, is saving it on the venues table, but that would as far as I can tell, mean storing it in a commaseperated list, which is bad.p  pThe other would be a table for available dates, containing the available day as an int or is this wrong and a foreign key for the codevenueidcode.p

Negative 69458 pIve got a RDS database with a table containing a ton of data in several columns some with geo spatial data I want to search across.  SQL queries and good covering indexes on this data is still far too slow to use for something like an AJAX type ahead suggestion field. p  pAs such, Im investigating options for search and came across Amazon CloudSearch now powered by Apache Solr and it seems to fit my needs.  The problem is, I cant seem to find a way via the AWS console to import or provide data from RDS.  Am I missing something Other solutions like ElasticSearch have plugins like coderivercode to connect an transform MySQL data.p  pI know there are command line tools for uploading CSV and XML data into CloudSearch.  So far the easiest thing I can find is to mysqldump table into CSV or XML format and manually load it with the CLI tools.  Is this with some reoccuring cron job the best way to do get datap

Negative 69458 pI know this is not the best way to use Cassandra, but the type of my data requires reading all data from the last week. However when using Collectiontypes in CQL3, I ran into certain limitations which prevent me from doing normal daterange queries.p  pSo I have set up Cassandra currently single node, probably more in the future with the following tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE cache tag text, id int, tags maplttext,textgt,    PRIMARY KEY tag, id  ALTER TABLE cache WITH GCGRACESECONDS  0 codepre  pI am inserting with a TTL of one week to automatically remove the items from the Cache. p  pI tried to follow the suggestions mentioned in a hrefhttpwww.datastax.comdevblogcassandraantipatternsqueuesandqueuelikedatasets relnofollowthis articlea to avoid reading many tombstones by selecting by minimum id, which I persist elsewhere to avoid reading old datap  precodeSELECT  FROM cache WHERE tag   AND id gt  codepre  pThe id is basically some sort of timestamp which is constantly increasing, i.e. I only insert higher values over time and constantly remove older ids from the table.p  pBut I still get warnings about thresholds being reachedp  precodeWARN 085906,286 Read 5001 live and 5702 tombstoned cells in cache see tombstonewarnthreshold codepre  pAnd if I do not run manual compactionscrubbing regularly I get exceptions and queries fail.p  pHowever based on my understanding from the articles and documentation, I should be avoiding most if not all tombstones here as I query on equality for the tag, which allows Cassandra to only look for those areas and I use a minimum id which allows Cassandra to start reading only after most of the tombstones, so why are there still tombstone warningsexceptions reportedp
Negative 69458 pI recently read that the kernel and the dynamic loader mostly deal with the codeprogram header tablescode in an ELF file and that codeassemblers, compilers and linkerscode deal with the section header tables.p  pThe number of program header tables and section header tables are mentioned in the ELF header in fields named  codeephnumcode and codeeshnumcode respectively. codeephnumcode is two bytes in size, so if the number of program headers is  65535, we use a scheme known as codeextended numberingcode where, codeephnumcode is set to code0xffffcode and codeshlinkcode field of the zeroth section header table holds the actual count.p  pMy doubt is  If the count of program headers exceeds 65535, does that mean the kernel andor the dynamic loader end up having to read the section tablep

Negative 69458 pI was trying to reduce the time it takes for an ant build to complete. Most of the build time is taken by GWT compiler. p  pFollowing ant script is written on the lines of scripts found in official GWT examples. Notice how two GWT modules are being passed to the Complier. When you run this script, the GWT compiler compiles the two modules sequentially.p  precodelttarget namegwtc descriptionGWT compile to JavaScriptgt     ltjava failonerrortrue forktrue classnamecom.google.gwt.dev.Compilergt         ........         ........          ltarg valuecom.af.gwtmodules.dashboard.Dashboard gt         ltarg valuecom.af.gwtmodules.administration.Administration gt         ltarg line localWorkers 16 gt     ltjavagt lttargetgt codepre  pI changed the task to run 2 compile tasks in parallel and in each task I pass only one GWT module to the compiler. p  precodelttarget namegwtc descriptionGWT compile to JavaScriptgt ltparallel threadsperprocessor16gt     ltjava failonerrortrue forktrue classnamecom.google.gwt.dev.Compilergt         ........         ........          ltarg valuecom.af.gwtmodules.dashboard.Dashboard gt         ltarg line localWorkers 16 gt     ltjavagt      ltjava failonerrortrue forktrue classnamecom.google.gwt.dev.Compilergt         ........         ........          ltarg valuecom.af.gwtmodules.administration.Administration gt         ltarg line localWorkers 16 gt     ltjavagt  ltparallelgt lttargetgt codepre  pThis indeed runs faster as expected. However, I wonder whether the GWT compiler can do a better job at code optimization if it is given all modules at once instead of each module separately. For example, the two modules use a lot of common code. So if the compiler can see the entire code base at once, it can find more redundant code. In theory, it can create a single JS artefact for the common code and separate JS artifacts for code that is not common. This would have the effect of reducing download time for the user who accesses both modules as common JS artifact would be downloaded only once.p  pAs far as I understand GWT modules are independent and so there would be no cross module optimizations. But the fact that GWT compiler internally does not parallelize this makes me think that there could be some cross module optimizations or other ramifications because of which Google engineers decided against parallelizing it beyond a limit.p  pI would like to know if parallelizing compile the way I have done, has any effect on quality of generated code.p

Negative 69458 pSo Ive inherited this extjs 4.1.3 project and Im trying to understand it. p  pIve noticed that there are both Ext.require and Ext.define requires EVERYWHERE. The code is made of a lot of boilerplate code from sencha docs and I feel there is a lot of redundancy. It makes a whole lot of clutter and I feel like its wrong that when I add a file, I have to add it more than once to Ext.require and Ext.define requires. p  pCouple of questionsp  p1 How can I tell if a require is actually ... required From my understanding, it only tells the web page to load something now or later this might be related to question 3. Am I guaranteed to see warnings from Ext saying you should include abc if those files are neededp  p2 Is there any difference between Ext.require and Ext.define requires Do I need both If I only need one, is one more standard than the otherp  p3 What exactly does Ext.Loader.setConfigenabled true do I am guessing that lets ext dynamically load things if I dont specifically require them. Shouldnt I not need requires at all then Im not saying this is good practice, but is it true Actually, if anything, isnt using this bad practice Youll end up losing track of dependencies if you dont have them written down. Or do you trust Ext.Loader to take care of everything relating to dependencies so that you dont even have to worry about it. p  pThe reason I ask because I thought this was true, but after the below experience, I am thinking it is not. p  pI thought I figured this out, but apparently my interpretation of Ext.Loader Question 3 is wrong because if I comment out all of my requires, I getp  precode[071505.577] Error [Ext.createByAlias] Cannot create an instance of unrecognized alias layout.border codepre  pIf I take out Ext.layout..

Negative 69458 pI have a large CC project that was recently ported from Solaris to Linux. I am in the process of setting up a common linux development environment using a vagrantvirtualbox virtual machine.

However, whenever I build the source in the guest VM, somehow GCC fails with the followingp  precodeIn file included from foobar.cpp72 ..foobar.h270 error uint32t does not name a type ..foobar.h273 error uint32t does not name a type ..foobar.h304 error WordCountType does not name a type codepre  pSo, it seems that we are missing an include to stdint.h right Well, I can actually add an include for this and compilation continues until other problems are hit.p  pThe mysterious part is that if I move the source code from the synced folder on the guest machine to one that is not within the vboxsf mount and run the build again. Everything works and the compilation completes successful.p  pWhats going on herep

Negative 69458 pIm just curious if there is a simpler way to do this. If I want to print a list of items on one line I simply write p  precodefor i in things   print i, codepre  pbut if I substitute print for return Im obviously only going to get the first item of the list. I needed the list to comma and space separated as well so I ended up with a function that looks like thisp  precodedef returnerthings   thing     n  1   for i in things     thing  i     if n lt lenthings       thing  ,      n  1   return thing codepre  pWas there a better way to do thisp
Negative 69458 pI have a sap.m splitApp where i have an overview of courses. By displaying a course you get detail information like the list of participants for that course.

Negative 69458 pIm using a couple of custom fonts in my site, one from google fonts and another that I uploaded along side the index.html. All properly declared in the css file. When I preview the site throught the HTML Editor Sublime Text 3 it shows just fine with all the custom fonts in place, but once I upload it to the server and acess the site through the internet all the fonts change to arial, I believe. This also happens in Internet Explorer. I looked the CSS file and its all good. The fonts are declared in the right elements and there is no overwrite. Now the wierd part is that when I open the site in Inconito Mode from Chrome, the fonts load just fine. Which makes me think that there is no problem with the css. When I inspect the element thought the browser it shows as crossed out. Have no idea what is causing this, anyone have ever seen something like thisp

This is generally easy to do manually by rightclicking and selecting rotate.  However, since I know it is necessary, I want to present them rotated.  The only way I have found so far is to use a css codetransformcode, but this also rotates the menu and scrollbar, which I dont want.p  pIs there any way, using css or javascript, to tell the browser to apply rotation to the embedded pdf  I mainly need this to work on Chrome, so a browserspecific solution is fine.p

Negative 69458 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13613594overridingclassconstantsvspropertiesthis StackOverflow questiona I learned that codeselfcode was not inheritanceaware where codestaticcode was in PHP. When it comes to defining a bunch of constants within a class, if you want to override those constants in a subclass to change default behaviours, it becomes necessary to use codestaticcode so that a method on the parent class that references the constant, honours the override.p  pIn the 2 years since I asked that original question, I have started using codestaticcode extensively, to the point that I rarely use codeselfcode since codeselfcode would appear to limit the extensibility of a class that uses constants, where codestaticcode does not have this limitation.p  pEven if i dont emcurrentlyem intend a constant to be overridden in a child class, I end up using codestaticcode, just in case  so I dont have to do a bunch of searchandreplace later, if it turns out I will want to extend the class and override the constant.p  pHowever, in others code, I strongrarelystrong see any use of codestaticcode. To the point that, up until 2012, I didnt even know it existed. So why is it not a general practice to use codestaticcode in the place of codeselfcode as a matter of coursep  pMy question, then, is are there any obvious emdownsidesem to using codestaticcode for refering to class constants, as opposed to codeselfcode Am I guilty of using a gross antipattern here p

Negative 69458 pThere is a very powerful library called a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebookimmutablejs relnofollowimmutablejsap  pThe philosophy comes from functional programming that a data structure is immutable and that every operation on a data structure creates a new one.

Negative 69458 pI would like to create a sparse matrix where undefined entries arent zero, but rather some value. The matrix Im trying to create counts the outcome of certain kinds of interactions between elements i and j, but since there are far more entries than interactions it will necessarily be very sparsehowever, it would be useful to enforce a uniform prior belief on the outcome of these interactions i.e., Laplace smoothing, which would render the matrix necessarily dense, although still just as compressible.

Negative 69458 pI know this is a long shot, but...p  pI have a simple custom object that stores the information needed to display an embedded YouTube video.  I have a web content subtab that displays the video embedded in the tab using the YouTube ID that is stored in the record.  I need to give business users links to these records with the subtab open so the users can stay in OCS and still watch the videos.  Every link Ive tried takes me to the list of video records, not to a specific video.  How do I get a link directly to a specific record.  Ideally, the subtab needs to be open, but I could probably live without that.p  pANY help would be appreciated.  Thanksp

Negative 69458 pI have tried to insert a Date Picker calendar on an Excel 2013 worksheet not a form, but without success. p  pMy process is 1. On Developer tab, Insert Active X Microsoft Date and Time Picker Control 6.0 SP4. 2. Insert it on the Excel spreadsheet. 3. Go to Properties and link it to the correct cell, in my case I2. 4. Take it out of the design mode to activate it.p  pWhat happened during my first couple of attempts was that Id click the spreadsheet to insert the Date Picker, and after doing the above steps I could click the down arrow for a calendar to appear. It worked except it would enlarge the font beyond acceptability. After trying to correct the font issue, I just dumped it and started all over again. Now I cant even get to the insert step without the message Cannot insert object. I have researched this to see what Im doing wrong, but Im seeing the same steps instructed as described above, so Im at a loss. I would REALLY appreciate any help on this.p  pThanks you so muchp

Negative 69458 pI have a very basic Android app in Googles Play store. Its basically one window with a webview showing local html content. Most users who download the app have no problems with it. However, a few are not able to use it at all. When they try to open it, they get a warning The file must have been renamed, moved, or deleted. In other words their phone or tablet cant locate the html files that are packaged together with the app. I cant replicate this problem and have no idea where its coming from. I wonder if anyone here run into this issue before and resolved it.p  pFor reference, the app design is shown below nothing special. A bunch of htm files is located in assets. One of them is referenced in the code explicitly  Contents.htm. Theres no css or javascript, but it didnt seem to make any difference as far as this particular error is concerned.

Negative 69458 pTwo questions.p  p1. When I use the statsmodels.tsa.ARMA module, I enter my parameters and fit a model as followsp  precode model  sm.tsa.ARMAdata, ARlag, MAlag.fit codepre  pJust wondering.  Say I enter numbers like ARlag  30 and Malag  30, is there any way to STOP the code from calculating all the lags between 1 and 30  I.e.  can I just calculate lag 30  For a single column of data about 360 entries in length the above code is burning the fire out of my brandnew, fully loaded, 15 MacBook Pro...  Another API, pydse, can solve my problem in 1012 seconds whereas the above method literally takes about 30 minutes.  I would use pydse, except it currently doesnt provide a confidence interval as part of its output  its a pretty new API.  Any ideas on how to use statsmodels to calculate a single, specific AR or MA lagp  p2.   Id like to specify a vector of important lags such as Arlag  [30, 60], and forget about the others  Similar to the first question, but sort of the next level.  Is there any way to do that and still avoid the problem described in item 1p  pMore infop  pIm usingp  precode model.predictStartDate, EndDate, dynamicFalse codepre  pto do outofsample prediction.p  pTo help you guys better understand my data Ive attached a plot of the actual data.  While the blue and red lines are actual data, the green line represents outofsample predictions based on an AR lag of 30.  Ideally it would have AR lags of 30 and 60 and an MA lag of 1, but my computer cant handle it because of the way statsmodels runs it or because I dont understand how to use statsmodels well.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxYRnL.png altenter image description herep

The priority logic is respectively depends on codeitemcodecode, codeitemtypecode and codeorigincode. To get the priority order Im using maps like belowp  precodeHashMapltString, Integergt itemCodeOrder  x.getItemCodeOrder       HashMapltString, Integergt itemTypeOrder  y.getItemTypeOrder  HashMapltString, Integergt originOrder  z.getOriginOrder codepre  pA typical priority order is like thisp  ul liitemCodeOrder  12, 10, 11 li liitemTypeOrder  6, 2, 4 li lioriginOrder    US, UK, FR, GEli ul  pIn the first place I want to choose the higher priority item in the list and than compare that item with my item to update or not. For example, in the list above codeitemno 10code has higher priority than code11code, so I will chose one of the items which has the codeitemno 10code. Then, I will look at the codeitemtypecode I have code2code and code4code, now Ill choose one of the the item with code2code. So after looking the codeorigincode, Ill get code[10, 2, US]code in the end Ill compare it with my item and update is likep  precode itemno   itemtype   origin      10           2       US codepre  pI want to write a generic code but I couldnt find a proper way to get prior item in the list with my codeHashMapcode logic.

The operation isnt atomic, other processes are just not getting through the critical section if another process is using it theyre intended to be able to continue after the lock is released if you can believe it, etc. etc. Obviously it needs to be fixed.p  pHow do I properly obtain a lock to synchronize access to the filesystem across multiple processes The processes are multiple instances of the same process, so they can share some protocol rather than specifically locking the directory i.e., they can easily use what is the equivalent to all instances of some class locking on something like codeprivate final static Object lock  new Objectcode to synchronize access to static methodsp

Negative 69458 pI made a git commit using Yosemite on my Macbook7.1 mid2010. Before this I used PC and git and BitBucket worked like a charm, without any errors like this ever happening. p  pI have simplified the issue so I can reproduce it to you more easily. I have typed just a single space in my file and commited this to bitbucket. After this , when I look at the commit diff on BitBucket on the internet repository, I am getting the diff that completely differs to the actual state of the file it should just have a single space in it.

Does anyone know something about this completely weird and ALIEN behaviour of bitbucket And how to mend this I highly doubt it and am planning to give up on this combination of development action script 3.0 on yosemite using bitbucket for git.

Negative 69458 pI have an activity that has within it one fragment that takes up the whole screen.

So you can imagine it asp  pFragment A 100 of the screen  Fragment B 50  Fragment C 50p  pI can think of two ways of doing this and neither one of them is particularly good. The first is to set a layout for the activity that has in it one container that will hold Fragment A, and then have Fragment A open subfragments B and C inside it. Im trying to avoid using subfragments because it leads to unusual lifecycle bugs and it also isnt supported by all version of the api. p  pThe second way is to have two layouts for the activity  one layout having a single container, and the second one having two containers and then switch between them at the appropriate moment with setcontentview.

Theres no logical point in having two seperate activities for this UI movement. p

Negative 69458 pIm building a background module for my app in Python 2.7, but it needs to use Cbased external libraries such as OpenCV. While GAE only directly supports pure Python libraries, I understand that using a managed VM removes that constraint.

However the tutorial suggest a prefiltering method to call for only the data the user would need, in my case, I would like to load all my 200 entries to the table, and then let the user to selectfilter whatever heshe wants. p  pI managed to make the two Ajax calls emone with first 1000 entries, and the other with the rest above 2000  for testing, to make it easy to see, which of them made into the tableem, and in debuggers both GET requests go out and come back with status 200OK, and the data, but only one of them are loaded into the table. p  pstrongThe questionstrong Are there any methods to combine the returning jqXHR responses before passing to the Datatable, or is there any setting, that after the table initialization, the second data doesnt overwrite the first one  I know, that the multiple ajax calls are a no go for most, but in my case, it is not a problem due to the speed of my server, and the usage frequency of the table, but so far I found solutions in the topic of multiple calls to populate multiple tables. p  pMy code so farp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt function LoadData  var call  .ajax             url httpsSP2010siteaddress.comsitevtibinlistdata.svcListnameselectData1,Data2,Data3,Data4,Data5,            type GET,            dataType json,            headers                  Accept applicationjsonodataverbose                               var call2  .ajax             url httpsSP2010siteaddress.comsitevtibinlistdata.svcListnameselectData1,Data2,Data3,Data4,Data5ampskiptoken2000,             type GET,             dataType json,             headers                  Accept applicationjsonodataverbose                                call, call2.donefunction data,textStatus, jqXHR             example .onxhr.dt, function  e, settings, json   for  var i0, ienjson.aaData.length  iltien  i   json.aaData[i].sum  json.aaData[i].one  json.aaData[i].two   Note no return  manipulate the data directly in the JSON object.   .dataTable ajax data.json,                        bServerside  true, bProcessing false, aaData data.d.results, aoColumns [  mData Data1 ,  mData Data2 ,  mData Data3 ,  mData Data4 ,  mData Data5  ], bRetrieve true, initComplete functionsettings, json  alert DataTables has finished its initialisation.     call.failfunction jqXHR,textStatus,errorThrown             alertError retrieving Tasks   jqXHR.responseText     ltscriptgtcodepre div div p  pThanks in advance to any suggestions how to tackle this.p

Negative 69458 pThis is an Edit to my original post to help clarify.p  pIs it common in eclipse to have to manually update JSPs after switching a project from hgp  pSay I am on branch A and have to switch to branch B.

The same may happen when moving from B back to A.p  pThe issue is not one or two it can sometime be many.

Negative 69458 pFirst post here so please be gentle. Am fairly new to coding and am trying to get my head around SWIFT and its optionals. Would really appreciate some advice from the pros p  pI am writing a simple app whereby textfields are entered by the user and then some multiplication occurs in app before spitting out an answer into another textfield on the press of a button calculateTM.p  pI am having some trouble with the calculation itself and perhaps its because I am trying to do too much on one line  take the textfield entry, convert to integer, multiply with another textfield entry converted to an integer, essentially what I wrote in the title p  precodevar someVariable Int  textfield.text.toInt  textfield2.text.toInt codepre  pThe problem is, Xcode is wanting my to force unwrap and add an  to the end of both toInt. This is fine, except of course when the user doesnt enter anything into the boxes and presses calculate, at which point the nil value causes the program to crash, e.g.p  precodevar someVariable Int  textfield.text.toInt x textfield2.text.toInt var someVariable2 Int  textfield3.text.toInt x textfield4.text.toInt  where the user doesnt enter anything into textfield3 or 4 codepre  pFollowing this simple arithmetic, the code updates the labels which are textfields as suchp  precode    label1.text  StringsomeVariable     label2.text  StringsomeVariable2 codepre  pSo this final conversion back to a string might also create some issues as to how the optionals are treated in the first part of the code.p  pApologies for the longwinded explanation, and I hope Ive been clear enough, but I imagine I am missing something really basic with the first part of the code. I have tried using the optional  and also the nilcoalescing operator to set to 0 in case of nil but cant get it to work. Please helpp  pMany thanks in advancep

Even if the entrance position would have been same as starting position there may have been an error. How should I deal with it Should I navigate only on the bases of the coordinates provided by dijkstra or use ultrasonics as well to prevent collisions And if we yes, can you give me an idea of how should I use the both ultrasonics, and coordinatesp  pa hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BwUKS98DxycUeW00RTZHdGk4Qkkviewuspsharing relnofollowHeres the sample Bitmap image of the maze.ap

Negative 69458 pive built a basic countdown timer in PHP which will echo the result back to be displayed on page by javascript every second or every minute, I havent decided if doing a get call every second will cause any issues yetp  pSo the countdown works by taking input from a user and updating a DB serverside. PHP then takes this value, converts it into a time format and uses it to calculate the end time for the countdown.p  pMy question is, I would like the timer to flash or something similar when the time changes based on new DB input... So for example the timer would be counting down to 2 hours. Another user submits the form which updates the database so now the end time is 5 hours away. Id like to somehow capture this change so I can display a message on the page. p  pIm wracking my brains about how to do this but cannot think of a method.p  pstrongbasic PHP im using to calculate the end timestrongp  precode    ltphp      timeUntil  100  placeholder, actual variable will be integer pulled from db     unixTime  86400     zTime  timeUntil  unixTime     endDate  time  zTime     remaining  endDate  time     daysremaining  floorremaining  86400     hoursremaining  floorremaining  86400  3600     minutesremaining  floorremaining  86400  3600  60     secondsremaining  floorremaining  86400  3600  60     zTimeCombined  arraydaysremaining, hoursremaining,          minutesremaining, secondsremaining     echo zTimeCombined     gt codepre
Negative 69458 pI am writing an orchestration restful web service that will broker the calls to multiple dependent services and package up the results into a single comprehensive result object.p  pPart of this is mapping the inputs and outputs of the various services into the inputs to the other services.p  pFor example, codeOrchestrationServicecode takes in an input.  It calls codeDepServiceAcode to retrieve a result.   It then takes the output of codeDepServiceAcode, combines it with the input to codeOrchestrationServicecode to produce the input to codeDepServiceBcode.  codeDepServiceBcode returns a result that is then combined with the result of codeDepServiceAcode and the input to codeOrchestrationServicecode to create the inputs to codeDepServiceCcode and codeDepServiceDcode.  All of this mapping is done via a cohesive mapper class  codeMappercode.p  pNow for the rub.  There are two similar, but distinct endpoints in codeOrchestrationServicecode that take in two similar, but distinct inputs, and call two similar, but distinct calls to codeDepServiceBcode.  emThe rest of the workflow is identicalem.  The only difference is the inputs to codeDepServiceBcode.p  pSo, I abstracted out the common parts of codeMappercode into codeMapperBasecode, an abstract class, and two subclasses codeMapper1code and codeMapper2code.p  pThe basic idea is this.p  precodepublic abstract class MapperBase      protected ServiceCInput MapToServiceCInputServiceBOutput output, [some other fields passed in from subclass state]         map to Service C Input           protected ServiceDInput MapToServiceDInputServiceBOutput output, [some other fields passed in from subclass state]         map to Service D Input           public abstract ServiceCInput MapToServiceCInputServiceBOutput output     public abstract ServiceDInput MapToServiceDInputServiceBOutput output   public class Mapper1  MapperBase      public ServiceCInput MapToServiceCInputServiceBOutput output         return MapToServiceCInputoutput, [state based params]          public ServiceDInput MapToServiceDInputServiceBOutput output         return MapToServiceDInputoutput, [state based params]           public ServiceBInput1 MapToServiceBInputServiceAOutput serviceAOutput         map to Service B Input 1        public class Mapper2  MapperBase      public ServiceCInput MapToServiceCInputServiceBOutput output         return MapToServiceCInputoutput, [state based params]          public ServiceDInput MapToServiceDInputServiceBOutput output         return MapToServiceDInputoutput, [state based params]           public ServiceBInput2 MapToServiceBInputServiceAOutput serviceAOutput         map to Service B Input 2       codepre  pNow, these mappers are used in the actual endpoints, no problem.p  pHowever, because Im a good developer, I want to ensure that these mappers conform to my specifications, and have unit tests to cover that.p  pcodeMapper1code has zero problems.  The unit tests compile and run.p  pcodeMapper2code has a similar set of unit tests.  However, codeMapper2codes set generates the following compile errorp  pcodeMapToServiceBInput is not supported by the languagecode.p  pThis occurs emonlyem in the unit tests project, and emonlyem for codeMapper2code.  It doesnt matter what I name the method.  It always generates this error with whatever name the method currently has.  No other method on either class has an issue.  Just this one.p  pIve tried the followingp  ul liremoving the reference to the endpoint project and readding itli licleaning the solution and manually deleting the binobj directories across the entire solutionli lirenaming the method.li liremoving the inheritance to the base classli lirebooting my machineli liplacing the call in a different file in the unit tests projectli liall combinations of the above.li ul  pI emalwaysem get this compiler error, but only for codeMapper2code and only for the unit tests project.  p  pIm at a loss.p

Negative 69458 pA novice in C, I am trying to create a client library in C that would connect to a web api and retrieve appropriate data.

I want to encapsulate this JSON data and return as an object. How do I go about doing that in C p  pI have the model that is used by the server to create the JSON file, I intend to use the same model to create the object from the JSON file.p
