They run some very basic performance tests which show that a DOMparser will have its throughput halved when the input files size is increased from 115 KB to 115 MB, or about 1000x larger. The throughput of the other models is not significantly affected.p  pUnfortunately they did not perform more detailed studies, such as of throughputmemory usage as a function of number of nodessize.p  pThe article is a hrefhttpdoi.ieeecomputersociety.org10.1109MC.2008.403here.ap  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI was unable to find any formal treatment of this problem. For what its worth, I have done some experiments measuring the number of nodes in an XML document as a function of the documents size in bytes. Im working on a warehouse management system and the XML documents are typical warehouse documents, e.g. advanced shipping notice etc.p  pThe graph below shows the relationship between the size in bytes and the number of nodes which should be proportional to the documents memory footprint under a DOM model. The different colors correspond to different kinds of documents. The scale is loglog. The black line is the best fit to the blue points. Its interesting to note that for all kinds of documents, the relationship between byte size and node size is linear, but that the coefficient of proportionality can be very different.p  p a hrefhttpwww.flickr.comphotos13583850N003190749168img srchttpfarm4.static.flickr.com34703190749168c999712308.jpg width500 height351 altbenchmarksbytesvsnodes a p

Negative 10474 pOk, so Im looking for a bit of architecture guidance, my team is getting a chance to recast certain decisions with a new feature that were building, and I wanted to see what SO  thought  There are of course certain things that were not changing, so the solution would have to fit in this model. Namely, that weve got an ASP.NET application, which uses web services to allow users to perform actions on the system.p  pThe problem comes in because, as with many systems, different users need access to different functions.  Some roles have access to Y button, and others have access to Y and B button, while another still only has access to B.  Most of the time that I see this, developers just put in a mishmosh of if statements to deal with the UI state.  My fear is that left unchecked, this will become an unmaintainable mess, because in addition to putting authorization logic in the GUI, it needs to be put in the web services which are called via ajax to ensure that only authorized users call certain methods.p  pso my question to you is, how can a system be designed to decrease the random adhoc if statements here and there that check for specific roles, which could be reused in both GUIwebform code, and web service code.p  pJust for clarity, this is an ASP.NET web application, using webforms, and a hrefhttpprojects.nikhilk.netScriptSharp relnofollowScripta for the AJAX functionality.

But if codeI want to redirect the request to a streaming server using the rtmp protocolcode. it doesnt do a thing. Any thoughts Is it even possible to redirect to anything other than a http addressp  pI also have codeweborbcode for dot net available which apparently has rtmp tunneling available. Is it possible to set up the request in that wayp

Negative 10474 pIm currently designing a database schema thats used to store recipes. In this database there are different types of entities that I want to be able to tag ingredients, recipe issuers, recipes, etc. So a tag has multiple nm relations.  If I use the three table design, this would result in tables cross table for every entity type recipes, ingredients, issuers that I have. In other words every time I introduce an entity I have to add a cross table for it.p  pI was thinking of creating one table which has a unique id, that all the entities refer to, and a nm relation between the tags table and the unique idtable. This way there is just one cross table between the unique idtable and the tag table.p  pJust in case that some people will think this question already was asked. I already read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions48475databasedesignfortaggingDatabase Design for Tagginga. And there the three table design is mentioned.p

Negative 10474 pMy program has to read files that use various encodings. They may be ANSI, UTF8 or UTF16 big or little endian. p  pWhen the BOM Byte Order Mark is there, I have no problem.

Negative 10474 pI know the basic difference as codeReleaseComObjectcode only decreases some counter by one and codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode decreases it to zero. p  pSo what I usually hear is, call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode because then you are sure that the COM object is really released. p  pBut this makes me wonder, there is a point to this counter right Arent you breaking that mechanism if you always call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode.

Not sure if this question is local to that domain i.e. outside Office Interop, codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode is not often used.p  h2Update 1h2  pThe a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea Dan mentioned talks about using codeReleaseComObjectcode when youre done. As I understand from the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea, this is the normal way. I think that if you do this consistently it should work fine. In a comment to the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea the author suggests someone to call codeReleaseComObjectcode in a loop until it is really released the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comvcblogarchive20060920762884.aspxarticlea is from 2006, so this is analogues to calling codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode. But he also states that this could be dangerous. p  blockquote   pIf you really want to the RCW to call Release at a particular point in the code, you can call ReleaseComObject in a loop until the return value reaches zero.  This should ensure the RCW will call Release.  However, if you do that, be warned, when the other managed references try to use that RCW, it will cause an exception.p blockquote  pThis leads me to believe that it is indeed emnotem a good idea to always call codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode, as you can cause exceptions elsewhere. As I see it now, you should only call this if you are absolutely sure that you can.p  pStill, I have little experience in this matter. I dont know how I can be sure. If the counter is increased when it should not be, is it not better to fix that problem If so, then I would say codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode is more of a hack than a best practice.p

In particular, it might take longer than the LowLevelHooksTimeout defined in the Windows registry. This means that, at least on Windows XP, the system no longer delivers mouse events to my hook function. Id like to avoid this, but at the same time I need the do interesting stuff part to happen embeforeem the target GUI receives the event.p  pI attempted to solve this by doing the interesting stuff work in a separate thread so that the codemouseEventHookFncode above can post a message to the worker thread and then do a codereturn 1code immediately which ends the hook function but avoids that the event is handed to the GUI. The idea was that the worker thread, when finished, performs the codeCallNextHookExcode call itself.p  pHowever, this causes a crash inside of codeCallNextHookExcode in fact, the crash occurs inside an internal function called codePhkNextValidcode. I assume its not safe to call codeCallNextHookExcode from outside a hook function, is this truep  pIf so, does anybody else know how I can run code which needs to interact with the GUI thread of an application before the GUI receives the event emandem avoid that my hook function blocks too longp

Negative 10474 pI am testing the performance of a data streaming system that supports continuous queries.p  pThis is how it works   There is a polling service which sends data to my system.

The ScrollViewdidScroll Method only animates the cell back to its normal place once it is scrolled of the viewport.  As in, under the NavigationBar or object that obscures it  The last key issue is the ability to detect if a menu is already visible or active and a cell is already off of the screen, slide the cell back to its original position, remove the menu view, and then slide the other cell out and add the menu.p  pI would like to be the first beside Loren to implement this as so many others have tried, especially on StackOverflow.p  pI apologize for the poor formatting in the code.p  pThanks in advance, Kolinp

Negative 10474 pI am in the hypothetical phase of thinking of how to do something in code, so I have no concrete code examples yet.  But, lets assume you have an entity type Person with attributes such as first name, last name, DOB, etc..  When one goes to edit a person entity, you may only update one or two fields possibly all, but usually not.  Think of this as implementing an audit trail albeit not a legal one, just informational, i.e. Tommy changed last name from Jones to Smith on 8282010. p  pThe question is, does LINQ provide an interface to compare what was changed on the person entity from the old, existing one to the newly submitted one  p  pOr must one loop through the old entity and the new entities properties and do a comparison on each one manuallyp  pPseudop  precodeFor each p as property in person    If oldEntity.p ltgt newEntity.p then        auditEntry  new auditEntryoldEntity.p, newEntity.p    end If Next codepre  pOr, is there anotherbetter way implement an IComparable interface for each entity in a partial class that can do thisp

Negative 10474 pWe had a CVS tree cvsrootv6 which uses Java 1.4 and Websphere 6.0. Now because we are upgrading our systems we copied the whole CVS tree i.e cvsrootv6 and make a new independent tree cvsrootv7 for Java1.6 and Websphere 7.0. p  pWhile having cvsrootv6 tree in production we started resolving some versioning issues with cvsrootv7. At the same time our developers did some changes in various files of cvsrootv6. Now we want the changes in cvsrootv6 to be reflected in cvsrootv7. p  pNow there will be 4 types of files corresponding to cvsrootv6 and cvsrootv7 1 Files changed in cvsrootv6 but no change in cvsrootv7 2 Files with no change in cvsroot6 but with come change in cvsroot7 3 Files with some change in both cvsroot6 and cvsroot7 4 Files with no change in either of the tree i.e cvsrootv6 and cvsrootv7p  pCan somebody guide us if it can be done automatically. I mean can we write some kind of scripts for the automation process or there is no option to do it automatically. Please let me know if problem is not clear to you or u have any questions. Thanks..p

Negative 10474 pI have a question concerning XML, Javas use of DOM, and empty nodes.  I am currently working on a project wherein I take an XML descriptor file of abstract machines for text parsing and parse a series of input strings with them.

Specifically, I need to be able to turn an empty InputString node into an empty string  and still execute my parsing routines.

Note the codemailcode script is not spam in anyway, but a way for the member site to gather some information and give feedback.p

I thought this way I will end up with an exact binary copy of the PDF, just with different header information.p  pWhats the easiestbest way to do this in C Are there any libraries available that could help me do this Im also interested in hearing different approaches to solve this problem.p  pThanks.p

Negative 10474 pI am implementing a text editor in C just using the vanilla Win32 API and Im trying to find the best way to implement syntax highlighting.  I know that there are existing controls out there like scintilla, but Im doing this for fun so I want to do most of the work myself.  I also want it to be fast and lightweight.p  pFrom what Ive learned so far, it looks like the most low level option for drawing text in GDI is the codeTextOutcode function.  However, if I need to keep changing the font color then that means I will need to make many calls to codeTextOutcode in order to draw one body of text with mixed formatting.  Is this inefficient  When syntax highlighting and rich text controls are implemented, would they be likely to use codeTextOutcode behind the scenes or is there some other way Is every other method of drawing text in GDI just a higher level wrapper around codeTextOutcodep

Negative 10474 pIm writing a server, which may be running hostile code.  To prevent an attacker from throwing a thread into an infinite loop, I want to enforce a onesecond execution time limit.p  pAn codeInterruptedExceptioncode can be caught inside an infinite loop, thus allowing an attacker to retain control of the thread.  Thus codeThread.interruptcode is not an acceptable solution.p  pMy current implementation prevents hostile threads from acquiring any resources including locks, uses codeThread.stopcode to terminate execution, and reverts any changes made by the thread.  My main complaint is that it uses the deprecated codeThread.stopcode method I dont like using deprecated code.p  pIm wondering if there is a more industryaccepted solution, short of launchingkilling an entirely new JVM, which would have too much overhead for my purposes.p

I am under the impression that if I move the declaration of Save to my ICormantControl interface then I will have to move the implementation of Save to each of the controls which implement ICormantControl. This would result in a large amount of duplicated code.p  pShould I be leaving my implementation in my helper class, moving the declaration to ICormantControl, and then, in each class which implements ICormantControl, I redirect the implementation to my helper methodp  pAs far as I can tell I am not able to have all of my controls inherit from an intermediary class. The common parent is too far up the hierarchy of inherited parent controls. It may be possible to extend WebControl and have it implement Save, but that seems orders of magnitude worse than my above suggestion.p  pDo I have other optionsp

Negative 10474 pI have a weird problem with the Windows Phone 7.1 API. Im trying to write an app to send touchdelta from the touchscreen to move a mousepointer on a desktoppc. Im using UDPsockets but I have some performanceissues.p  pThe sending of udpmessages seem to freeze for 0.51.0 sec every 0.5 seconds or so. Im not sending huge amounts of data and Im throttling it as well. My latest attempt to find whats causing it turned out a bit unexpected.p  pWhen having a separate thread with a whileloop that keeps sending randomdata everything works smooth and fine. But when I start touching the screen of the WP7mobile I start getting these weird hiccups. I have removed all listeners on touchevents for debugging purposes and Im not doing anything else in my app then sending this data on a UDPsocket. But why is it freezing up like this when I move my finger over the screen It kind of makes it impossible to write an app like this. p  pIve heard that touchmanipulation should be moved to a dedicated thread, is that included in the Beta2 refresh of WP7.1p  pThe code goes somewhat like thisp  precode    new Thread gt              while true                      event.Reset             socket.SendToAsyncargs             event.WaitOne             Thread.Sleep5              .Start codepre  pThe eventhandle is set when SendToAsync is completed. So it keeps sending udpdata about every 5 ms. It works fine I can receive in a steady and rapid rate as long as I dont touch and drag my finger on the phones screen. Then I start getting 1 sec freezings in regular intervals. Very strange since Im running the udpfiring on a separate thread.

But the important thing is that the struct is NOT anonymous.p  pNow in codeList.hcode which of course is included in codeList.ccodeIve defined another typedefp  precodetypedef struct List ListP codepre  pWhich as far as I understand it defines ListP to be a pointer to a struct called List, just like I really named it.p  pAnd heres where I get the errorsp  precodevoid freeListListP list      ObjectP obj1     ObjectP obj2     if list  NULL              obj1  listgthead         while obj1gtnext  NULL   lt HERE                      obj2  obj1             obj1  obj1gtnext   lt HERE         freeObjectobj2              freelist       codepre  pI dont understand why codeobj1  listgtheadcode is ok, but everywhere else I try to gain access to struct members I have this error.  As I said Ive tried looking for it, but other ppl had mistakes I cant find in my code. Thanksp  pEDIT codeList.ccode also includes codeObject.hcode so this is not the problem. The definition of object as is follow p  pin codeObject.hcode I have codetypedef struct Object ObjectPcode and in codeObject.ccode I havep  precodetypedef struct Object      void key     ObjectP next  Object codepre  pStill dont know what the problem isp

Negative 10474 pHopefully this is a nice quick question to answer.p  pWhich language is considered to be the defacto language for writing hobbyish operating systems from scratch, that also supports the creation of 512 byte boot sectors Im assuming plain C is the answer, although I have this vague concept in my head that C can also be used. Do any of you have any opinions about alternative but potentially superior languages, given the passage of time Would others highly suggest plain old assemblerp  pAnd, following on from your answer, what free and perhaps even open source compiler would you recommend for compiling the source code into binaryp  pPS I am fully aware that writing an OS is a very challenging task and Im sure Ill never finish. I am conducting a personalinterest research task and would like to at least create a MBR and very basic kernel with simple console IO.p
Negative 10474 pIm thinking about security problems, made some questions, read some articles..... its too difficult to get all information from all those articles with very different methods and put them in 1 place to have normal user login and user check system.p  pToday Ive read about haveing mysql table with active users list instead of storing sessions. As I understand sessions are too difficult to secure, and on the other hand mysql table I think is very easy to make.p  pFor example, users loggs in. Instead of making some user session, I can simply insert new data into activeuserstable and add user ip there.p  pAnd on all pages I can ask client for ip, then go to mysql table check if such ipuser is logged in, if yes check what rights does the user have and give him corresponding  access.p  pstrongQuestion 1.strong Isnt it simple  easier to make then securing sessionsp  pstrongQuestion 2.strong If this system is good enough so I could stop my research and construct site using this method question is how can I understand if the user is still active  If he will press log out button ok , I will log out him and delete his record from the table. But if he restarts his PC or something how can I understand when the record will be available for destruction p  pstrongQuestion 3.strong one guy told me to use mysqli instead of mysql commands when Im working with database. Are they the same so I just have to add i to all my commands and its ok, or mysqli is a bit different and needs some study  and also why is it better  WHy I cannot use normal mysql commands to which I got used top
Negative 10474 pI am a newbie dabbling in C and my little project is to write a simple SOCKS4 proxy. Thanks to the help here i got so far to use nonblocking sockets and poll for my routine. However at this point i seem to have 2 problemsp  ol lipThe outgoing Socket dstSocket doesnt get closed if the incoming Socket rcvSocket gets closed and vice versa. I dont check for this in the loop, but i dont know how. I tried POLLHUP as revents, but that doesnt seem to do the trick. A normal check seems to be whether recv returns 0, but is that also valid for nonblocking sockets And if so, how does that work with revents, i cant seem to figure out where i would put this, since if POLLIN  POLLPRI are set it seems to me recv never should return 0 Also i dont understand what the exact difference is between POLLIN and POLLPRI, seems to me just a check data is available for reading in either casepli lipThe proxy seems to work for connections i tested with netcat. However if i use a browser, it says when i target a website whether i want to save binary data. I checked the data in wireshark and what is received from the server is correctly forwarded to the client byte by byte it seems. If anyone maybe has an idea why that could happen with this program it would be nice pli ol  pAttached the relevant code beware programming newbiep  precode fds[1].fd  dstSocket  fds[0].fd  rcvSocket  fds[1].events  POLLIN  POLLPRI  POLLHUP  fds[0].events  POLLIN  POLLPRI  POLLHUP   timer  pollfds, 2, timeoutmsecs  i dont use this yet    fcntlrcvSocket, FSETFL, ONONBLOCK  fcntldstSocket, FSETFL, ONONBLOCK   while 1  1        if fds[0].revents amp POLLIN  POLLPRI               recvMsgSize  recvrcvSocket, rcvBuffer, RCVBUFSIZE, 0         if recvMsgSize gt 0 senddstSocket, rcvBuffer, recvMsgSize, 0            if fds[1].revents amp POLLIN  POLLPRI                sndMsgSize  recvdstSocket, sndBuffer, RCVBUFSIZE, 0         if sndMsgSize gt 0  sendrcvSocket, sndBuffer, sndMsgSize, 0                      if fds[0].revents amp POLLHUP  fds[1].revents amp POLLHUP               closercvSocket         closedstSocket         codepre

Negative 10474 pIm working on an iphone game that I plan to submit to the app store soon but theres one thing that I havent figured out yet. My game has multiples levels for the player to pass obtaining scores along the way to complete the campaign. My question is can I add more levels to the app later through level packs, as in, not updating the game itself with those new levels but allowing the user to downloadbuy the packs separately if they wantp  pI want to do something like the shooter games for consoles do have the original game at a price and the map packs DLC at a smaller price, but still separate. I understand that I could just update the app with the new levels in it but then the users that had the app purchased before that would get the new levels for free by just updating.p  pI dont want to have multiple versions of the game like Angry Birds Original, Seasons, Rio, etc... if can just have one, with several packs on the side.p  pI tried searching the web but couldnt find a definite answer so I hope you guys can help. Thanks.p

All looked great, and we deployedlaunched.p  pNow were getting negative feedback from everyone and their dog stating that the site isnt rendering properly in other browsers, browser versions, or on FireFox installations running on different operating systems. Similarly, the site is apparently a total mess when being viewed through a smart phone or tablet device.p  pNow I emcouldem dive in and write a whole bunch of messy, nasty, painstakinglytedious edits to my CSS rules, that basically say emdo X when browser is Yem, etc. But I am hoping that out there is a tool that can put all my fears to rest.p  pWhat Im looking for is a tool that could take my valid CSS files, and use them to generate CSS rules that will be compatible with a high percentage of all common browsersversions.p  pAlternatively, if I have to rewrite my CSS from scratch, it would be nice to have a tool that allows me to emwritedesign once, deploy manyem, so that I only have to focus on the design of a single CSS file, but the code that gets generated is multibrowser compatible.p  pIt sounds like DreamWeaver strongkind ofstrong does this, but you have to choose from one of 16 preexisting templates.p  pMy wife is a graphic designer, and made the website pretty sweet not cookie cutter. It was a nightmare trying to figure out what CSS rules to use to implement her design.

Heres the code I used for thatp  precodeHttpTransport TRANSPORT  new NetHttpTransport JsonFactory JSONFACTORY  new JacksonFactory String SCOPE  httpswww.googleapis.comauthcalendar String CALLBACKURL  urnietfwgoauth2.0oob String CLIENTID  myClientID String CLIENTSECRET  myClientSecret String authorizeUrl  new GoogleAuthorizationRequestUrlCLIENTID, CALLBACKURL, SCOPE.build String authorizationCode    At this point, I have to manually go to the authorizeUrl and grab the authorization code from there to paste it in here while in debug mode  GoogleAuthorizationCodeGrant authRequest  new GoogleAuthorizationCodeGrantTRANSPORT, JSONFACTORY, CLIENTID, CLIENTSECRET, authorizationCode, CALLBACKURL authRequest.useBasicAuthorization  false AccessTokenResponse authResponse  authRequest.execute String accessToken  authResponse.accessToken  gets the correct token  GoogleAccessProtectedResource access  new GoogleAccessProtectedResourceaccessToken, TRANSPORT, JSONFACTORY, CLIENTID, CLIENTSECRET, authResponse.refreshToken HttpRequestFactory rf  TRANSPORT.createRequestFactoryaccess AccessProtectedResource accessProtectedResource  new GoogleAccessProtectedResourceaccessToken HttpTransport transport  AndroidHttp.newCompatibleTransport  Calendar service  Calendar.buildertransport, new JacksonFactory     .setApplicationNameMy Applications Name     .setHttpRequestInitializeraccessProtectedResource     .build  Events events  service.events.listprimary.execute  this works codepre  p10 Finally, my question I would like to use the account from the AccountManager on the device itself in order to retrieve a working OAuth2 token for use with the Google Calendar API. The second method is not useful for me, because the user will have to manually go to their web browser and get the authorization code, which is not user friendly. Anyone have any ideas Apologies for the long post, and thanksp

Negative 10474 pI recently implemented a security mechanism for Linux which hooks into system calls. Now I have to measure the overhead caused by it. The project requires to compare the execution time of typical Linux apps with and without the mechanism. By typical Linux apps I assume ex. gzipping 1G file, doing find , grepping files. The main goal is to show the overhead in different types of tasks CPU bound, IO bound etc.p  pThe question is how to organise the test so that they will be reliable The first important thing is the fact that my mechanism works only in kernel space, so it is relevant to compare systime. I can use time command for it, but is it the most accurate way of measuring systime Another idea is to run those apps in long loops to minimize error. Then the loops should be inside or outside time command If they are outside I will get many results  should I choose min, max, median, averagep  pThanks for any suggestions.p

Negative 10474 pI have not been able to find a way to send a simulated click to a flash .SWF application on a site Im visiting using the WebBrowser control in WinForms.p  pThough Ive read countless posts on the subject, there seems to not be much information floating around on the internet.

Thank youp  hr  pstrongUPDATE 3232012  2332012strong p  pSince no feedback, I figured Id post an updatep  pI wound up just sniffing the packets sent by the .SWF, and then sent that same data via the webBrowserObject.Navigate method.  Thanks anywayp  hr  pstrongUPDATE 3312012  3132012strongp  pWound up bringing back to life my old debate of whether or not to use SendMessage or PostMessage to send an actual click to the window without hijacking the mouse. It seemed beneficial to have both the physical and imitated clicks as optionsfeatures for the program, so I wound up implementing the physical click as well, via PostMessage.  What I did was Grabbed the handle from the WebBrowser.Handle, looped through the handles, stopped looping at the Internet ExplorerServer handle, and then PostMessaged a double click to it at the coordinates specified.p  pI hope this update is helpful for anyone who is reading up on ways to send clicks to the WebBrowser control without invoking a simulated click on a dom element.p

Negative 10474 pAlright, so for a couple days now I have been trying to integrate Facebook authentication into my Codeigniter based website. I have included the Facebook PHP SDK as a library and that seems to connect just fine, however when I use the getUser method in the SDK a 0 is returned indicating that I am not logged in except that I am logged in to facebook. Below I have included the PHP SDK in library form, the model that calls the methods in the SDK, the controller that captures data from the model, and the view that displays the information to the user. I hope that yall can offer me some insite in to this aggravating issue. Thanks for all your help in advance and just incase yall are wondering I am using some code from a tutorial I found on a hrefhttpwww.dannyherran.com201102facebookphpsdkandcodeigniterforbasicuserauthentication relnofollowhttpwww.dannyherran.com201102facebookphpsdkandcodeigniterforbasicuserauthenticationa p  pFB PHP SDK library stored in applicationlibrariesp  precodeltphp if   definedBASEPATH exitNo direct script access allowed     Copyright 2011 Facebook, Inc.

Negative 10474 pFor a homework assignment, were to be turning the codebasicComparecode method into something that will compare two text documents and see if theyre about similar topics. Basically, the program will strip out all of the words less than five characters in length, and it leaves us with lists.

I cant think of or find a way to compare the two lists and find out what percentage of the words are in both lists. Maybe Im thinking about it wrong, and need to filter out words that arent in both lists and then just count how many words are left. The parameters for defining whether or not the input documents match are left entirely up to us, so those can be set however I want.

Negative 10474 pWe have an Xcode project that includes both Retina graphics for a NIBbased UI and a WebView UI. This project builds an app for the Mac.p  pThe project uses two separate build phases to move these graphics into the final app. The first is the traditional Copy Bundle Resource which gets both the 1x and 2x graphics into the application package. The second is a Copy Files build phase which copies the web graphics into a separate Resources destination with a graphics subpath.p  pThis avoids some naming conflicts and lets the web designer use a familiar graphicswhatever.png path.p  pWhen building this project, we get a Dependency Analysis Error that saysp  blockquote   pMultirepresentation image whatever2x.png cannot be processed by a   Copy Files build phase  try a Copy Resources build phase, or disable   COMBINEHIDPIIMAGES.p blockquote  pIts easy enough to turn off the Deployment Build Setting called Combine High Resolution Artwork, but this affects the graphics used in the NIBbased UI as well as the ones in the WebView UI. With the option turned on, codebutton.pngcode and codebutton2x.pngcode get combined into a codebutton.tiffcode in the application packages Resource folder. Without it, the original names are used.p  pAs far as I can tell, the application behaves normally, but since COMBINEHIDPIIMAGES is set on by default, I suspect there is some benefit to deploying the graphics as a single file faster to load and cache, perhaps.p  pIdeally, Id like to only disable COMBINEHIDPIIMAGES during the Copy Files build phase. I cant figure out a way to do this, hopefully someone else here can...p  pstrongUpdate 8272012strongp  pFor this particular application, the easiest way to fix the problem was to replace all HTML images with the 2x version. Since the  tags specify a width and a height, the images are scaled down by 50 on a nonRetina device. The quality is fine and since theyre being loaded from the local filesystem theres not perceivable performance impact.p  pstrongUpdate 8282012strongp  pAnother approach we took was with naming conventions. Some HTML images are specified using CSS with a media query selecting the Retina or nonRetina version. To avoid problems with these images being combined into a single HiDPI image, we used whatever.png and whateverretina.png.p

Negative 10474 pUpdate to original post A colleague pointed out what I was doing wrong.  Ill give the explanation at the bottom of the post, as it might be helpful  for others.p  hr  pI am trying to get a basic understanding of the limits on network performance of python programs and have run into an anomaly. The code fragmentp  precodewhile 1     sock.sendtoa,target codepre  psends UDP packets to a target machine, as fast as the host will send. I measure a sending rate of just over 4000 packets per second, or 250 us per packet. This seems slow, even for an interpreted language like python the program is running on a 2 GHz AMD opteron, Linux, python version 2.6.6. Ive seen much better performance in python for TCP, so I find this a bit weird.p  pIf I run this in the background and run top, I find that python is using just 25 of the cpu, suggesting that python may be artificially delaying the transmission of UDP packets.p  pHas anyone else experienced anything similar Does anyone know if python does limit the rate of packet transmission, and if there is a way to turn this offp  pBTW, a similar C program can send well over 200,000 packets per second, so its not an intrinsic limit of the platform or OS.p  hr  pSo, it turns out I made a silly newbie mistake. I neglected to call gethostbyname explicitly. Consequently, the target address in the sendto command contained a symbolic name. This was triggering a name resolution every time a packet was sent. After fixing this, I measure a maximum sending rate of about 120,000 ps. Much better.p

Negative 10474 pI have a pretty standard script that uses the merge functionality to insert, update, and delete records. However, I am having a lot of trouble with outputting deleted results to an audit type table. When I run the procedure against a clean target table I somehow end up with all nulls in the audit table, despite the fact nothing has been deleted only inserts to nonaudit table at this point, which does happen as it should. Under the same conditions and against the same clean target table, if I remove thep  precodeOUTPUT deleted.Column1, deleted.Column2 INTO TableAudit Column1, Column2 codepre  pand replace it withp  precodeOUTPUT action, Inserted., Deleted. codepre  pI see that nothing has actually been deleted, which is odd considering the source and target tables were the same on both runs and the merge predicate remained the same. All the records in the action column of the second statement are inserts as we would expect. Literally the only thing different is what I just mentioned above. Any ideas as to what could be going onp
Negative 10474 pbeing new to sphinx please excuse any mistakes or misused terms. p  pSphinx is being used in a web based app with a database of millions of records in order to provide fulltext search functionality.p  pFor English content stored in the database the search results are accurate and relative to the search keywords. The same thing does not happen with nonlatin characters. I had a look at the morphology configuration setting but the Greek language is not available as an option. Thus for Greek keywords the search results are not always AS relevant to the search keywords as the keywords in English.p  pDoes sphinx perform the same text analysis and indexing to the Greek content the way it does for the English content p  pAny information links, comments, answers would be helpful.p  pthanks,p

Negative 10474 pI created a website using HTMLCSS to display a SQL reports index.  This has worked fine up till now because users needed access to a security group and something inside SQL to view the report and the data fields.  We are now getting to the stage where there are too many reports and some have sensitive names so we need to limit access based on Active Directory security groups.  Thing is that I have no clue at all how to manage access via AD Groups.  I have managed to get basic AD authentication working for another project that I deployed for the company, but that didnt require access beyond Domain Users.p  pCould anyone please point me in the right direction to authenticate via AD, check a user for groups and then display info based on their access.  The last bit should be really easy, the hardest part will be checking group info and then filling a variable that I can then use to create a loop that will display all the reports the user has access to.p

Negative 10474 pIm trying to implement a fairly simple method in which I want to filter a list. This is a list of File objects and there should be exactly one file that ends with .asp  I want that one excluded from the list.

Negative 10474 pIm trying to replace our existing serialization with Protobuf. Problem is we currently use ISerializable to check whether data has changed and only serialize the original value if the data has changed. This is done by using two nullable variables and only adding the original value in ISerializable.GetObjectData to the info object if the value has changed.p  pWhen deserializing, in the ISerializable constructor, I read the SerializationInfo to find which members were serialized and which ones were not. If an original value was not serialized, its value is set to the current value. therefore saving resources as it wasnt serialized.p  pIs there a way in Protobufnet for me to find out what fields were deserialized I am using the ShouldSerialize pattern to not send the original value as I explained above, but when I get to the other end I need to know what fields were serialized to be able to set the original value.p  pEdit More Details, here is a sample class.p  precode[Serializable] [ProtoContractImplicitFields  ImplicitFields.AllFields] public class SomeClass  ISerializable      internal int key     internal int originalKey      internal bool ShouldSerializekey              return key.HasValue          [NonSerialized]     public bool keySpecified      internal bool ShouldSerializeoriginalKey              return key  originalKey          [NonSerialized]     public bool originalKeySpecified     [OnDeserialized]     internal void OnDeserializedMethodStreamingContext context               Use this to set the originalKey if it hasnt been specified.         if originalKeySpecified                      originalKey  key                codepre  pAs you can see, originalKey is not serialized if it has the same value as the key. When the object is Deserialized, I want to know if originalKey was Deserialized or not. I thought your answer of originalKeySpecified would work, but in the class above, once I Deserialize, the originalKeySpecified is always false. Does the Protobuf deserialization process set the value Note that I cant use the ShouldSerialize property to decide whether to set the originalKey when deserialized as it may have been changed from null to another value, which I need to know when saving in the data store.p

Negative 10474 pFirst, p  pI want to indicate that I know that any information sent from the client cannot be trusted as it can be spoofed. I am interested in methods of security through obscurity to deter 99.9 of potential cheaters and ability to detect programs that do get around the security in real time.p  pSome ideas I had for this included verifying file and memory checksums of both the game it is securing and also any potential cheat apps by allowing the clientside to scan on request from the server via TCP, both for detecting memory injection cheats and or a cheats memory footprint. Therefore the bypass hack would have to listen for all TCP information being sent to it on SSL, and then unencrypt the message by disassembling the encryptiondecryption function to understand what it wants. Similarly, the client itself may be self changing and allow for it to addremove features as needed at random but keep by the server so that it would be hard for a cheat to learn how to bypass it. This may be pointlessp  pI only find this to be moderately difficult for the more experienced, so I am open to other methods that may be hard to bypass.p  pI am only interested in possible implementations and not how its impossible to have a clientside anticheat, I just want to make it really really hard.p  pAdded minecraft and java tag, and its for Minecraft, and I know the community is large enough that someone is likely to beat my system, but I hope through the use of constant updates and changes that I can beat them through ingenuity and perseverance. p  pEdit I found this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions960499howtopreventcheatinginourmultiplayergamesrq1How to prevent cheating in our multiplayer gamesa and I am adding his suggestions so not to duplicate things, as I am looking for more ideas than the obvious and I am not sure if his arent bypassablep  blockquote   p1 Open all other processes, and hook their WriteProcessMemory functions so that they cant write to the memory in your games   process. Done right this one step will block 90 of all cheats and   cheat engines.p      p2 Do the same thing, hooking the various mouse and keyboard emulation   functions. This will prevent a lot of aimbots and other types of   automation bots.p      p3 Hook into the VirtualProtectExVirtualAllocExetc functions in your   games own process and monitor which modules are changing protection   levels or allocating new memory chunks. You have to be crafty with   this in order to prevent it from being too CPU intensive when your   game does a lot of allocations, but it can be done.p      p4 Hook into the LoadLibrary functions and monitor any DLLs that are   being loaded dynamically, to prevent DLL injection.p      p5 Use some lightweight polymorphic encoding on your game connections.p      p6 Use some antidebugging techniques to prevent debuggers from   attaching to your processes. Google antidebugging and you should be   able to find lots of stuff.p      p7 Use a custom proprietary PE packer to prevent useful disassembly of   your game.p      p8 Hook into your OpenGL or Direct3D functions and methods that deal   with transparency and alpha blending.p      p9 If using shaders, checksum your shaders and the shader constant   values.p      p10 Use additional occlusion culling techniques on player characters   to prevent them from being rendered at all when the line of sight to   them is blocked by other geometry.

Negative 10474 pI have an h264 mp4 video that is 960x540, 1000kbps and 30 minutes long. This will be playing off of a disc. I noticed strongonlystrong in chrome that when I open the web page it is embedded in, my computer slows way down and the video gets all choppy for a solid 5 seconds every time...almost like it is loading the entire resource.p  pI tested playing the file in IE9 and Firefox and these seem to play ok when I first open it. I really wish chrome would ditch their version of flash and just use the plugin version that all the other browsers use.

Negative 10474 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm interested in using MEF to provide a plugin architecture in a WinForm application using C with .NET 4.0, but I am not clear on a couple of things.p  pFirst  I have not worked at all with building DLLs yet in C, and Im a little fuzzy on the concept of DLL Assemblies and how a DLL is normally loaded into memory  meaning, all at once or in pieces as needed p  pstrongIntentstrongp  pThe program will be a machine hardware control framework, and will be made up of a primary WinForm GUI that is a generic environment with basic toolbars, menus, etc  but no bulk GUI content.   Think MDI Parent but not actually .p  pThe plugins provide all of the controls for a specific machine.  Each of many possible plugins will contain potentially 30 to 50 large UserControls, each populated with many dozens of WinForm Controls and tons of support code that makes up the various machine control panels.p  pThis means that the main program is a lightweight general framework and the plugins contain the bulk of the GUI controls and functionality that will be shown in the main program user interface, including lots of icons, images, and other resources.  This will make the plugin DLLs potentially quite large.p  pThe goal is to allow the user to select a plugin from a menu, and then upon selection, load and run the plugin which will then fill the mostly empty main GUI with panels, menus, and toolboxes galore.p  pTo do this, I need to first extract metadata from each plugin to populate the initial menu for the program, which will include the plugin title, description, icon, version numbers, and other bits of info.p  pstrongHere are the questionsstrongp  pWith MEF, if I try to read the metadata from each of many large DLLs that are stored in a plugin folder, will the entire DLL be copied into memory before the metadata values are accessed   p  pIf so, is there any way to open each DLL file and only read the metadata into memory to build the initial menu  then later load the full selected DLL through MEF p  pI am assuming that the typical DirectoryCatalog and AggregateCatalog template for reading plugins through MEF will copy all of the discovered DLLs into memory and store them in the catalog collection.p  pDo DLLs contain one contiguous code block  assembly , or can they contain multiple separate blocks that are indexed and copied to memory individually as needed  multiple assemblies  p  pIm probably not understanding the fundamentals, and maybe confusing terms.  I would appreciate any insight into the load behavior of MEF, DLLs, and Assemblies in general.  Thanks p

Negative 10474 pBrought up on python, since started Java recently Ive consistently used a class selfreference codethiscode whether or not it is mandatory. I believe it helps the code readability as people who read it dont have to figure out on their own what scope the variable belongs to. I would like to work similar with the static scope precede all references to the static context with a codestaticcode keyword and so make the code a bit more selfexplanatory. Java however doesnt like it. I know I could technically use simply the class name, but this looks pretty ugly, especially when a class has got a lengthy name. I could also precede the names of static methods and attributes with a special prefix, but I wouldnt like to be considered a paranoiac. Would you guys consider any of this a good OOP style Or should I just completely forget about anything vide supra and let javac do all the scopebindingp

Negative 10474 pstrongWhat I havestrongp  pI have a codeUserControlcode made of a codeTextBoxcode and a codeListBoxcode. The codeListBoxcode has its codeItemsSourcecode bound to an codeObservableCollectioncode in a codeDataContextcode via a codeListCollectionViewcode with a custom sorting and filter as well see below.

For that purpose I apply a filter on the codeListCollectionViewcode.p  pI have two additional constraints. 1, my original collection is not alphabetically sorted but the items displayed in the codeListBoxcode are using a codeListCollectionViewcode codeCustomSortcode. 2, I must display only the first 5 items alphabetically sorted that match the string in the codeTextBoxcode.

as expected, except the filtering which is done in the codeApplyFiltercode method. Basically, this method just checks each and every item in the collection against whatever is in the codeTextBoxcode and provided there is not already more than the maximum number of items returned, the item will be included in the filter. When I debug this method, I can see that items are browsed in the original order of the collection and not in the sorted order althought the filter seem to be done on the codeListCollectionViewcode and not the codeObservableCollectionltstringgtcode.p  pIt seems the filter is applied first, then the sorting. I want the sorting to apply first then the filtering.p  pstrongMy questionstrongp  pHow can I apply the filter on the sorted codeListCollectionViewcode and not on the original nonsorted collectionp

Negative 10474 pI had developed the below code in which we can sort the codeHash Mapcode basis on the key as well as on the basis of value also. p  pthe main logic is that we can sort codeMapcode, be it codeHashMapcode or codeHashtablecode by copying keys into codeListcode than sorting codeListcode by using codeCollections.sortcode method, here you can use either codeComparatorcode or codeComparablecode based upon whether you want to sort on custom order or natural order. Once codeListcode of keys are sorted, we can create another Map, particularly codeLinkedHashMapcode to insert keys in sorted order. codeLinkedHashMapcode will maintain the order on which keys are inserted, result is a sorted Map based on keysp  pMy query is that if you cal please advise me for other better approach or any improvement you guys can suggest.p  precodepublic class MapSortingExample        public static void mainString args[]           creating Hashtable for sorting         MapltString, Integergt olympic2012  new HashMapltString, Integergt          olympic2012.putEngland, 3         olympic2012.putUSA, 1         olympic2012.putChina, 2         olympic2012.putRussia, 4         olympic2012.putAustralia, 4 adding duplicate value          printing hashtable without sorting         System.out.printlnUnsorted Map in Java    olympic2012          sorting Map e.g. HashMap, Hashtable by keys in Java         MapltString, Integergt sorted  sortByKeysolympic2012         System.out.printlnSorted Map in Java by key   sorted           sorting Map like Hashtable and HashMap by values in Java         sorted  sortByValuesolympic2012         System.out.printlnSorted Map in Java by values   sorted           Sorting Map in Java by keys using TreeMap         MapltString, Integergt sortedMapByKeys  new TreeMapltString,Integergt         sortedMapByKeys.putAllolympic2012         System.out.printlnSorted Map in Java by key using TreeMap    sortedMapByKeys           Sorting Map by keys in Java using Google Collections Guava         Main benefit is you can specify any ordering like natural or toString or arbitrary         MapltString, Integergt sortingUsingGuava  Maps.newTreeMapOrdering.natural         sortingUsingGuava.putAllolympic2012         System.out.printlnExample to sort Map in Java using Guava    sortingUsingGuava                     Paramterized method to sort Map e.g. HashMap or Hashtable in Java       throw NullPointerException if Map contains null key           public static ltK extends Comparable,V extends Comparablegt MapltK,Vgt sortByKeysMapltK,Vgt map         ListltKgt keys  new LinkedListltKgtmap.keySet         Collections.sortkeys          LinkedHashMap will keep the keys in the order they are inserted         which is currently sorted on natural ordering         MapltK,Vgt sortedMap  new LinkedHashMapltK,Vgt         forK key keys             sortedMap.putkey, map.getkey                   return sortedMap                  Java method to sort Map in Java by value e.g. HashMap or Hashtable       throw NullPointerException if Map contains null values       It also sort values even if they are duplicates           public static ltK extends Comparable,V extends Comparablegt MapltK,Vgt sortByValuesMapltK,Vgt map         ListltMap.EntryltK,Vgtgt entries  new LinkedListltMap.EntryltK,Vgtgtmap.entrySet          Collections.sortentries, new ComparatorltMap.EntryltK,Vgtgt               Override             public int compareEntryltK, Vgt o1, EntryltK, Vgt o2                  return o1.getValue.compareToo2.getValue                                LinkedHashMap will keep the keys in the order they are inserted         which is currently sorted on natural ordering         MapltK,Vgt sortedMap  new LinkedHashMapltK,Vgt          forMap.EntryltK,Vgt entry entries             sortedMap.putentry.getKey, entry.getValue                   return sortedMap        codepre  poutput would be..p  precodeUnsorted Map in Java  USA1, England3, Russia4, China2 Sorted Map in Java by key China2, England3, Russia4, USA1 Sorted Map in Java by values USA1, China2, England3, Russia4 Sorted Map in Java by key using TreeMap  China2, England3, Russia4, USA1 Example to sort Map in Java using Guava  China2, England3, Russia4, USA1 codepre

Negative 10474 pIm currently trying to compile an old program made with C builder 2 or 3 with the current Embarcadero RAD Studio XE2.p  pSo, I was wondering whether there is an easy way to use the old code, as Borland once claimed to be fully compatible to lower versions... however I couldnt find a projectfile, only sourcecode .cpp, .h, .res, etc..br I tried to add to project the main .cpp, however there seem to be some wrong includepaths... it also seem to use the OWLpackage and includes its important sourcefiles...p  pIm a bit confused which type of main project I have to open first, since you need to open a new project before adding the source to it. As the running .exe has a GUI, I tried a FormWindow first, but it may be better to use a console or service as the real form is produced within the code as far as I understand.p  pSo, after installing OWL and correcting the includepaths, do you think it should be running fine Or is there something else to take care ofp

Negative 10474 pI have setup a network monitoring system at my office that monitors activity over my network and shoots me an email at certain triggers that i have setup. I have put together an application that quickly does the job for me custom made for the kind of monitoring that i need and rules that i have setup. Now everything is fine and i have setup the emails to be sent using gmail smtp using swift mail plugin. p  pThe problem is gmail is locking my gmail account if a burst of emails is sent or atleast that is what i think. What happens is sometimes theres a lot of activity and the system sends like 50 or 60 emails over a short span of time like in a minute or two. Immediately gmail blocks access to the account and when i open the account in my browser it asks to verify my account. Even after unblocking it the server is still not able to open to gmail account using smtp or imap. p  pThis is getting annoying and i would like to know if there is a way to stop gmail from blocking access to an account if it knows that the access is from a specific IP or if there is a better way to send lots of emails. p

Negative 10474 pOkay so Ive been having a heck of a time getting my IDE environment setup for Ruby and RoR. Every issue so far Ive been able to solve except one so I humbly ask the mighty stackoverflow for guidance. p  pMY RubyMine install is having trouble recognizing some installed gems or more specifically, SQLite3, Mysql, and Mysql2. Using Gem quick install on RubyMine fails on all three, however, installing the gems with the proper config is successful in cmd. While that is successful, RubyMine cannot or will not recognize the installed gems. The require mysql2 with require rubygems placed before it fails right out of the gate with RubyMine stating that it cannot load such a file. When accessing the RoR server on localhost through firefox, I get an error stating that the gem is not loaded and I should add it to my Gemfile  I should state at this point that all the above gems were already in the gemfile and if not I added them and ran bundle install which is confusing. Ive spent days scouring the interwebs and stackoverflow for a solution but nothing seems to work. I even tried going from the 64 version of ruby 2 to the 32 bit version and some previous versions.p  pon a side note, would it be easier to code ruby in a linux distro like Ubuntup  pCurrently I am using RubyMine 5.4 IDE on Windows 8x64 within a custom rig. I have three Ruby SDKs to use 2.0x64PO, 2.0PO, and 1.9.3 and have the most current version of Rails installed.

Negative 10474 pI am using CodeIgniter but this question applies in a general sense too.p  pI have a table of transactions with columnsp  precodeitemname  type  date  price  document codepre  pI want to do the following in two completely strongindependentstrong cases.p  p1 Get a list of transactions within a certain date range. 2 Get the total price of each transaction.type within a certain date range.p  pThe former can be achieved by simply using a select statement with  datetimestampp  pThe latter can be achieved by selecting the SUM, and grouping by the type whilst like implementing any required where conditionals e.g with  datetimestampp  pAlthough a simple case, to achieve this I need to have two methods however the bulk of both of these methods namely the WHERE clauses are duplicated across both methods.p  pIn terms of speed etc it does not matter but it seems like pointless code reproduction.p  hr  pA second example is as follows.p  pI previously had a method codegetdataIDcode which would get a row from a table based on the ID passed in.p  pAs such in a separate method I would get my 100 items for example.. return an array, loop through them and call getdata for each.p  pThis setup meant that many different methods could get different lists from different sources and then still use the same getdata function and a loop to get the required data.p  pThis minimized code duplication but was incredibly ineffiecient as it meant looping through loads of data items and hundreds of db queries.p  pIn my current setup i just join the data table in each of my methods  code duplication but clear improved efficiency.p  hr  pA final example is as followsp  pIn codeigniter I can have a function such as the followingp  precodegetthingID  thisgtloadgtdatabase thisgtdbgtwhereID,ID thisgtdbgtgettable  codepre  pBUT in alternate situations i might want to only get items in a specific folder.. as such making the function more generic works better.. e.g.p  precodegetthingarray  thisgtloadgtdatabase thisgtdbgtwherearray thisgtdbgtgettable  codepre  pbut then I might want to use this function in two different contexts e.g a user page and an admin page whereby admins can see all items, even unverified ones. My code now becomesp  precodegetthingarray,showunverified  false  thisgtloadgtdatabase thisgtdbgtwherearray ifshowunverified  false  thisgtdbgtwhereverified,YES  thisgtdbgtgettable  codepre  pAs you can probably see this can quickly get out of hand and methods can become overly complex, confusing and full of conditionals.p  hr  pMy question is as follows  What are best practices for minimizing code duplication, and how could they be applied to the above situations I spent hours and hours trying to make my code more efficient yet Im getting nowhere because I cant workout what I should really be trying to achieve.p  pCheersp

Negative 10474 pI am working on a intranet project, which uses javascript for client side effectswidgets, like tree, grid, dragging.

Negative 10474 pI have a CDR that I have burned some data onto.  I know that the consumed storage space cannot be recovered, but is there some way to delete the data so it cant be easily recovered from the disk  Not just deleting filesystem entries, but actually burning out the data  My understanding of the way CDROMs works is that the data is physically recorded by etching the bit pattern into a substrate layer in a way that changes the reflective properties of that layer, so one could erase the data by etching the remaining unetched bits.  Could this be done, and if so, is there an existing program for accomplishing thisp

Negative 10474 pI am quite new to Android programming and I wonder what the best approach would be to keep information updated while the screen is off.p  pThe specific situation is as follows  I use a service that extends Service and implements SensorEventListener.   I use the accelerometer to check if the user is sitting or standing onSensorChanged.   If the user have been sitting for a specified time the device vibrates and beeps. p  pThe problem is   The service dont update at a frequency that makes the alarm go of i time. Sometimes is is late by a couple of minutes, sometimes it just updates as I turn the devicescreen on.   The update frequency seems to vary between devices.p  pMy question is   What would be the best approach to solve the problem Maybe a service isnt the best solution. p  pMy intention is to keep the service running a long time in the background.p  pAlso, I do not want to use a Wake lock because of the battery which is an important factor in the situation.p  p Victorp

Negative 10474 pIn our sitecore 6.6.0 rev. 130404 based project, we are required to migrate data from the old systems database to the sitecore database. We need to migrate around 650,000 objects. Each of these objects from the old database will create around 4 sitecore items in the master database. So its a fairly large set of data being migrated.p  pWeve hooked up sitecore APIs with a windows application and we run the data migration logic from that app. At the begining of the data migration, things are fairly fast, around 4 objects per second are transferred to sitecore master database. The first 10,000 objects only took 40 minutes. At this rate, one would predict that in 7 hours, 100,000 objects will be migrated.p  pBut the problem is over time, things get increasingly and noticeably slow. After having around 100,000 objects migrated, now it takes around 7 hours to migrate just 30,000 objects. I even rebuilt sitecore database indexes time to time as mentioned in the performance tuning guide. We also dont perform any sitecore queries to find where to place the newly created sitecore items. No sitecore agents or lucene index update operations are running when our data migration is happening.p  pHeres the code at the beginning of the data migration logicp  precodeusing new Sitecore.SecurityModel.SecurityDisabler using new Sitecore.Data.Proxies.ProxyDisabler using new Sitecore.Data.DatabaseCacheDisabler using new Sitecore.Data.BulkUpdateContext codepre  pCould the reason for this slowness be the growth of sitecore database indexes.

Negative 10474 pI want to achieve more randomness in my key generation implemented in java since the key strength is depending on it.p  pI want to use the codejava.security.KeyPairGeneratorcode to create private and public keys.

Enough for what I mean I think it depends on what you need it for. Right And the question was how can I even increase the randomness ITPro yeah, I could use the square of the time, but I think the user input is more random, right Did you mean by saying after user input to collect an array of bytes and pass it after the user finished all his inputs to the generatorp  pEDIT 2 03.12.13 Erickson I think what you are saying is not true these system level devices are already gathering entropy from key presses Can you please share a link to this You might have some more understanding in this topic than me, but please, if you say something like that I would like to read some more details about itp

Negative 10474 pSome of my forms require validation, for which I use the JQuery validation plugin.p  pSome of my forms require a custom submit handler which conditionally popsup a confirmation dialog before submitting, independent of validation.  I attach the handler to the form like sop  precodefunction confirmHandlerAttachform, handler    form.offsubmit, confirmHandlerDefault   form.onsubmit, handler  codepre  pBoth validation and the submit handler are attached at doc ready based on classes.  Independently, both work fine.  The problem is that it seems that the forms submit handler being called regardless of whether the validation succeeds.  See a simplfied example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsferrari63VGj2R relnofollowherea.p  pThis isnt what I would expect.  I would think that validation would prevent both the submission and the submit handler from running.  Am I doing something wrong, or are my expectations wrongp  pI realize that I could instead use validations submitHandler property, and if necessary Ill go that route.  But since validation and confirmation or any other submit handler are really independent functions, it seems a shame to have to change all form submit handlers to deal with the JQuery validate plugin just in case some form uses validation.p

Negative 10474 pI am struggling to understand the constructor invocation pattern in Javascript.

In the following code the object codeCatcode correctly inherits from the Mammal object. p  precode    Mammal base Object    var Mammal  functionname    this.name  name     Mammal.prototype.getname  function    return this.name        Mammal.prototype.says  function     return this.saying          Cat object    var Cat  function name    this.saying  Meow     this.name  name    Cat.prototype.purr  function number     var i 0, s     for  i0 iltnumber i      if s           s        sr     return s     Cat.prototype  new Mammal   console.logPseudo classical inheritance approach  var mammal  new Mammal I am a mammal  console.logWho are you    mammal.getname  console.logWhat are you saying   mammal.says   var cat  new CatI am a cat  console.logWho are you    cat.getname  console.logWhat are you saying   cat.says codepre  pWhat I dont like in this pattern is how the constructor of the base object is used. The object codeCatcode does not reuse correctly the constructor of the base class codeMammalcode. I would like to have a more flexibility. Each time a codeCatcode object is created, the constructor of the codeMammalcode object is invoked with no arguments. I would like to use a mechanism similar to the super keyword in Java, so that when the constructor of codeCatcode is called with codenamecode as parameter, also the constructor of codeMammalcode is called with codenamecode as parameter. p  pI tried to implement the codeCatcode constructor as follows  p  precode  var Cat  function name        this.saying  Meow          Super name       this.prototype  new Mammalname       codepre  pThis does not work as expected. codethis.prototypecode is undefined. why Why this approach is completely wrong does codethiscode point to the newly codeCatcode object p  pI know, there are different ways to implement inheritance in javaScript, but I am wondering if there is a way to implement the super mechanism like in Java. p  pThanks.

Negative 10474 pUPDATED I answered my own question.  It may be and idiots solution but then again I am not convinced the frame work is idiot proof.  My problem was that I could not get the load event to fire for my store.  I added the following lines after the init function but before this.control functionp  precode    init function       Ext.getStoreUsers.addListenerload,this.onUsersStoreLoad, this      Ext.getStoreUsers.addListenerdatachanged,this. onUsersStoreDataChange, this      this.control                viewport gt userlist                      itemdblclick this.editUser,         ,           useredit button[actionsave]                      click this.updateUser                               ,  onUsersStoreLoad functionme,records,success    Do something ignorant with your code here  codepre  pThis works for a paged gridstore or whatever.  Please feel free to make suggestion on how to improve this if this is a bad way to approach the load event for my store.p  pThanks, UPDATE ENDp  pI can not for the love of godcountry figure how to loop through a store or grid.  I am newbie and while I think it would better to loop through the store opposed to a grid I can seem to find a way to do either.  I have read several posts where folks seemingly have the same issue and have found a solution.  However, when I try to implement the solution i get an undefined error when loging to console.  Clearly my understanding is sub par as I am unable to determine if i am putting my code in the proper places.p  pI have used this link in SO as a model of what I want to do and I cant get it to workp  precodehttpstackoverflow.comquestions3149107howtoloopthroughtheextjsgridobjecttogetitselementsandvalues codepre  pI want to disable dates in my date picker with an array.  It works when I hard code it but what I really want to do is load the dateArray dynamically with the unixtimestamp coloumn of my grid provided by my users store.  I have tried stub in message boxes everywhere I can possibly do it and I can not seem to get it to fire so that tells me i am fundamentally screwed up.

Negative 10474 pI use Spring MVC 3.2.4. I have a controller method that receives data from an HTML form. The method has the following signaturep  precodeRequestMapping... public String updateProductValid Product product, BindingResult bindingResult codepre  pIn the method, I can get information about both strongdata bindingstrong e.g., a noninteger value in an integer field and strongvalidationstrong JSR303 errors in the following wayp  precodeif bindingResult.hasErrors      ListltFieldErrorgt errors  bindingResult.getFieldErrors      for FieldError error  errors          System.out.printlnerror.getObjectName      error.getCode       codepre  pI want to change this method so that it could receive data in JSON format instead of codeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedcode. I added codeRequestBodycode annotation to the method signaturep  precodeRequestMapping... public String updateProductValid RequestBody Product product, BindingResult bindingResult codepre  pIn the updated method I still can get all strongvalidationstrong errors in the same way. However, strongdata bindingstrong errors generate an codeHttpMessageNotReadableExceptioncode. The exception seems to have no properties for accessing things like the error code and fieldobject name. Besides, the exception prevents the JSR303 validation, and the user does not receive any JSR303 validation messages till the next data submission.p  pHow can I get the information about strongdata bindingstrong errors when I implement a controller method that receives JSONp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOne workaround that I can think of is changing all fields in the codeProductcode class to codeStringcode and then validating them with JSR303. This way, no strongdata bindingstrong errors will ever happen. But I will have to create a clone of the codeProductcode class with proper data types.p

Negative 10474 pIm developing a web application that needs to access 100 or more different Google Calendars using OAuth2. All the calendars are on different accounts with their respective users. I came across this paragraph from Googlep  precodeNote that there are limits on the number of refresh tokens that will be issued one limit per clientuser combination, and another per user across all clients. You should save refresh tokens in longterm storage and continue to use them as long as they remain valid. If your application requests too many refresh tokens, it may run into these limits, in which case older refresh tokens will stop working. codepre  pMy app, as advised, is using access tokens and then storing the refresh tokens in a database for later use. I am wondering if I will reach a limit to the number of calendars my refresh tokens will work with Has anyone experienced difficulty before with refresh tokens stop working after a limit is reached. The paragraph mentions two limits but Im not sure if my app will be affected as each calendar is a different user. Im not sure what Google means by and another per user across all clients limitp  pAnyone with experience or knowledge in this please help.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 10474 pIm still trying to get my head around all this and Im obviously missing some fundamental concepts.p  pIn my code I have a scenario whereby I want to call several functions in a row and when theyve all completed, wrap it up with a finishing routine where subtotals are calculated and a pie chart is updated.p  pAlthough the functions I call themselves arent asynchronous, they do contain ajax calls which are, hence why I want to wait for all of them to finish before I calculate totals and update the chart.p  pSo I tried doingp  precode    var fnArray []     fnArray.pushgenericCalcuse, true, false, false     fnArray.pushdoArticleImpactsfalse     fnArray.pushgenericProjectCalctpD2C, false, false     fnArray.pushgenericCalceol, true, false, false     fnArray.pushcalcPackagingfalse      var calcPromise  Q.allfnArray      return calcPromise             .thencalcsDone             .failcalcsFailed      function calcsDone          calcTotals          setChartselectedRow           function calcsFailed          logger.logErrorFailure in calculations, , null, true      codepre  p...but using the above code and using the script debugger with a stop on the return calcPromise line, the fnArray is set to 0undefined, 1undefined, 2Object, 3undefined, 4Promise even before the promise is activated.p  pI understand that this is obviously something to do with my functions, but I dont really understand what I need to do differently.

Negative 10474 pI am currently working on a NUMA machine. I came across an issue that when I perform disk IO, the page cached started to pile up in the current node node 0. And when I further codemalloccode new memories, they went to another node node 1, leading poor performance.p  pI am thinking of two possible solutions, but do not know if they work.p  p1 Use codenumaalloconnodecode on node 0. But I am not sure if this could overwrite the page cache in node 0 or still going to node 1.p  p2 To drop cache node 0 whenever they start to pile up cache in node 1 should not be dropped as they are useful. But I dont know how to do this.p

Negative 10474 pProblem I need to sample from a discrete distribution constructed of certain weights e.g. w1,w2,w3,.., and thus probability distribution p1,p2,p3,..., where piwiw1w2....p  psome of wis change very frequently, but only a very low proportion of all wis. But the distribution itself thus has to be renormalised every time it happens, and therefore I believe Alias method does not work efficiently because one would need to build the whole distribution from scratch every time.p  pThe method I am currently thinking is a binary tree heap method, where all wis are saved in the lowest level, and then the sum of each two in higher level and so on. The sum of all of them will be in the highest level, which is also a normalisation constant. Thus in order to update the tree after change in wi, one needs to do logn changes, as well as the same amount to get the sample from the distribution.p  pQuestionp  pQ1. Do you have a better idea on how to achieve it faster Q2. The most important part I am looking for a library which has already done this.p  pexplanation I have done this myself several years ago, by building heap structure in a vector, but since then I have learned many things including discovering libraries   , and containers such as map... Now I need to rewrite that code with higher functionality, and I want to make it right this timep  pso Q2.1 is there a nice way to make a c map ordered and searched not by index, but by a cumulative sum of its elements this is how we sample, right... that is my current theory how I would like to do it, but it doesnt have to be this way...p  pQ2.2 Maybe there is some even nicer way to do the same I would believe this problem is so frequent that I am very surprised I could not find some sort of library which would do it for me...p  pThank you very much, and I am very sorry if this has been asked in some other form, please direct me towards it, but I have spent a good while looking...p  pzp  pEdit There is a possibility that I might need to remove or add the elements as well, but I emthinkem I could avoid it, if that makes a huge difference, thus leaving only changing the value of the weights.p  pEdit2 weights are reals in general, I would have to think if I could make them integers...p

Notice that the part in the above thats black but supposed to be red stays black, but the part thats red is now codeCOLORACTIVECAPTIONcode.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comMkwYVQQ.png altincorrect 2p  pImages are from wine.p  pWindows XP is even worse the codeGetDCExcode call which is straight out of MSDN fails with no last error code set, and changing it to use the seemingly equivalent codeGetWindowDCcode results in a transparent correct red border, a transparent correct  red border, and the whole window having the titlebar color, respectively. wine output doesnt change.p  pAm I misunderstanding something about codeWMNCCALCSIZEcode I know all inputs and outputs are in the same coordinate space, so I assumed I could just mainpulate those coordinates and call it a day. I did try handling the valid rectangles fields codergrc[1]codecodergrc[2]code, both by setting them to empty rectangles and by making codergrc[1]code set to the new client rect, but neither fixed the issue here.p  pThe codeMoveWindowcode also doesnt seem to be it if I remove that and keep the popover at its initial size, it still draws as above, with the same corrupt red border problem.p  pThanks.p  pHere is the code. Because it is a test to figure out what to do, theres no error checking yet. The final code will have full error checking.p  precode 9 october 2014 define UNICODE define UNICODE define STRICT define STRICTTYPEDITEMIDS  get Windows version right right now Windows XP define WINVER 0x0501 define WIN32WINNT 0x0501 define WIN32WINDOWS 0x0501        according to Microsofts winperf.h  define WIN32IE 0x0600             according to Microsofts sdkddkver.h  define NTDDIVERSION 0x05010000     according to Microsofts sdkddkver.h  include ltwindows.hgt include ltcommctrl.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltuxtheme.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltwchar.hgt include ltwindowsx.hgt include ltvsstyle.hgt include ltvssym32.hgt   qo LIBS user32 kernel32 gdi32   TODO   investigate visual styles   put the client and nonclient areas in the right place   make sure redrawing is correct especially for backgrounds   wine BLACKPEN draws a white line might change later so eh   should the parent window appear deactivated  HWND popover  define ARROWHEIGHT 8 define ARROWWIDTH 8         should be the same for smooth lines   LRESULT CALLBACK popoverprocHWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam      PAINTSTRUCT ps     HDC dc     HRGN region     POINT pt     RECT r     LONG width     LONG height      switch uMsg      case WMNCPAINT         GetWindowRecthwnd, ampr         width  r.right  r.left         height  r.bottom  r.top         dc  GetDCExhwnd, HRGN wParam, DCXWINDOW  DCXINTERSECTRGN         if dc  NULL abort         BeginPathdc         r.left  0 r.top  0       everythings in device coordinates         pt.x  r.left         pt.y  r.top  ARROWHEIGHT         if MoveToExdc, pt.x, pt.y, NULL  0 abort         pt.y  height  ARROWHEIGHT         if LineTodc, pt.x, pt.y  0 abort         pt.x  width         LineTodc, pt.x, pt.y         pt.y  height  ARROWHEIGHT         LineTodc, pt.x, pt.y         pt.x  width  2  ARROWWIDTH         LineTodc, pt.x, pt.y         pt.x  ARROWWIDTH         pt.y  ARROWHEIGHT         LineTodc, pt.x, pt.y         pt.x  ARROWWIDTH         pt.y  ARROWHEIGHT         LineTodc, pt.x, pt.y         pt.x  0         LineTodc, pt.x, pt.y         EndPathdc         SetDCBrushColordc, RGB255, 0, 0         region  PathToRegiondc         FrameRgndc, region, GetStockObjectDCBRUSH, 1, 1         SetWindowRgnhwnd, region, TRUE         ReleaseDChwnd, dc         return 0     case WMNCCALCSIZE                      RECT r  RECT  lParam             NCCALCSIZEPARAMS np  NCCALCSIZEPARAMS  lParam              if wParam  FALSE                 r  ampnpgtrgrc[0]             printfd  d d d dn, wParam, rgtleft, rgttop, rgtright, rgtbottom             rgtleft             rgttop             rgtright             rgtbottom             rgttop  ARROWHEIGHT             return 0              case WMERASEBKGND         return LRESULT GetStockObjectHOLLOWBRUSH     case WMPAINT         dc  BeginPainthwnd, ampps         GetClientRecthwnd, ampr         FillRectdc, ampr, GetSysColorBrushCOLORACTIVECAPTION         EndPainthwnd, ampps         return 0          return DefWindowProcWhwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam   LRESULT CALLBACK wndprocHWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam      switch uMsg      case WMCOMMAND         if HIWORDwParam  BNCLICKED ampamp LOWORDwParam  100              MoveWindowpopover, 50, 50,  200, 200, TRUE             ShowWindowpopover, SWSHOW             UpdateWindowpopover             return 0                  break     case WMCLOSE         PostQuitMessage0         return 0          return DefWindowProcWhwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam   int mainint argc, char argv[]      WNDCLASSW wc     HWND mainwin, button     MSG msg      ZeroMemoryampwc, sizeof WNDCLASSW     wc.lpszClassName  Lpopover     wc.lpfnWndProc  popoverproc     wc.hbrBackground  HBRUSH COLORBTNFACE  1     wc.style  CSDROPSHADOW  CSNOCLOSE     if RegisterClassWampwc  0         abort     popover  CreateWindowExWWSEXTOPMOST,         Lpopover, L,         WSPOPUP,         0, 0, 150, 100,         NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL     if popover  NULL         abort      ZeroMemoryampwc, sizeof WNDCLASSW     wc.lpszClassName  Lmainwin     wc.lpfnWndProc  wndproc     wc.hbrBackground  HBRUSH COLORBTNFACE  1     if RegisterClassWampwc  0         abort     mainwin  CreateWindowExW0,         Lmainwin, LMain Window,         WSOVERLAPPEDWINDOW,         0, 0, 150, 100,         NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL     if mainwin  NULL         abort     button  CreateWindowExW0,         Lbutton, LClick Me,         BSPUSHBUTTON  WSCHILD  WSVISIBLE,         20, 20, 100, 40,         mainwin, HMENU 100, NULL, NULL     if button  NULL         abort     ShowWindowmainwin, SWSHOWDEFAULT     if UpdateWindowmainwin  0         abort     while GetMessageWampmsg, NULL, 0, 0 gt 0          TranslateMessageampmsg         DispatchMessageWampmsg          return 0  codepre

Negative 10474 pstrongIm trying to find if renaming the wild card certificate would bring down the sites that are already using it even if it is momentary or cause any other undesirable effect Any help or pointers on thisstrongp  pSome background on why Im trying to do this I have a web application that is utilizing the wildcard certificate for a specified IP address at port  443 in the Production server has IIS 7. Now, I want to utilize the same wild card certificate, IP address amp port  for another web application on the same server. However, the host header text box is disabled when I try to edit binding.p  pBased on my findings so far and going thru few blogs, I can either use appcmd utility to change the binding or rename the SSL certificates friendly name, which would enable the host header text box. Hence, I would be able to use the same wildcard certificate  IP address  Port  combination with different host header for my new web application. I tried this on my laptop and found that it successfully works. However, it renames the wild card for the site that was already using it. I did not observe any negative impact such as the existing site going down or the IIS reset occurring during this process. But, Im not in favor of trying this out in the production environment, without fully understanding the impact of this change.p

While the JSON data is showing that it is being inputted into all articles with the ID, the function codecheckViewerscode is only functioning correctly for the first article ID codeviewedcode.p  pIdeally, the codecheckViewerscode function should make all codeviewedcode IDs appear as the first article ID codeviewedcode is currently appearing e.g. First name Last name and Remaining Number of People have viewed this post.

Negative 10474 pHi there,p  pThe problem I am having is when viewing my site through any iOS 7 device with Safari. Every time I change page on my website the browser window goes white, and then a moment later the page starts rendering correctly.p  pOther websites dont do this, so after tearing out my hair for many hours, I narrowed it down to some CSS being applied to my page container. Its forcing hardware acceleration viap  ul liwebkittransform translate3d0,0,0li liwebkitoverflowscrolling touchli ul  pIf I remove that css, when changing pages on my site, there is no white flicker inbetween page loads. Unfortunately, I need that css to get hardware acceleration and smooth scrolling.p  pFrom what Ive read I surmise it may have something to do with the html container being promoted to a layer because its hardware accelerated and that is somehow causing the browser to render strangely.p  pIve found a few articles on this, but no answer that has worked for me. Has anyone run into this and maybe have a solutionp  pThanks very much, Basp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo with a bunch more experimenting and reading, I have a few more clues.p  pWhat Ive found is that any composite layer seems to cause this for me on page load.p  pFor example, my sites menu bar is codepositionfixedcode this makes it a composite layer. When I make the menu not codepositionfixedcode, when changing page, the menu bar did not flicker. i.e. the rest of the page went white and then a moment later the new content rendered, but the menu bar continued to be rendered throughout.p  pMy next experiment seems to indicate that its actually the page being unloaded not the new page that is being loaded that is the problem. What I mean by this is I used the codewebkitoverflowscrolling touchcode css on my container as usual. What I did different was I wrote a line of javascript to remove that css property from the container after a few seconds. Now when I changed page the browser did not go white before rendering the new page. So I think this means it is something to do with how the Safari browser unloads a page that has composite layers on it.p  pCould anyone confirm if my suspicions may have some merit or if Im COMPLETELY misreading the situationp  pThanks againp  papologies if my terminology is incorrect, Im still a little new to web techp

Negative 10474 pI must fulfill a web service with codePUTcode as method to send changes. This service is used to change configurations. So, for example, if I send codevarAtruecode to codeurlconfigurationchagecodeit sets the corresponding variable, and if I send codevarBtruecode it changes codevarBcode without affecting codevarAcode.p  pI always though that codePUTcode and searching google it seems as if I am right just overwrites the resource or creates it if not existing.

Negative 10474 pIm investigating using Ruby on rails to develop web apps. So far it does look like an extremely well thought out framework which ultimately takes a lot of laborious tasks out of the development process. However I have a doubtp  pI can only seem to get to see the ROR web app in development when I am developing on PC A and visiting localhost3000 from PC A. However, I want to host my web app on a Raspberry Pi web server which is always on in my home. Therefore I see 2 possible optionsp  p1 Develop the web app on PC A then copy the ROR web app into the varwww directory of the Raspberry Pi web server with a standard Apache2 config  Will this work For a ROR web app to work must you use the rails web serverp  p2 Develop directly on the Raspberry Pi using a remote connection from PC A  This doesnt seem to be so easy. I have installed the necessary software on the Raspberry Pi and configured my router to forward any requests received on port 3000 to the Raspberry Pi server on port 3000. Even so when I access my external IP on port 3000, there is an error saying that the external IP cannot be accessed.p  pCan anybody give me any advise p

Negative 10474 pI have a very weird and probably obvious problem, but I cant seem to find the bug. Ive got a class object that holds a pointer to another class object, and when the firsts deconstructer is called, it tries to delete its pointer, but instead causes a segfault without ever entering the seconds deconstructor.p  pSpecifically, I have an instance of the class Optimizerp  precodeclass Optimizer  public     Optimizer     Optimizer     Lots of public methods and such  private     PredictionRenderer predictionRenderer      Lots of member variables    OptimizerOptimizer      stdcoutltltoptimizer destructorltltpredictionRenderergtgetWidthltltstdendl     delete predictionRenderer THIS LINE CRASHES AND NEVER MAKES IT INTO THE PREDICTION RENDERER DECONSTRUCTOR     other calls  codepre  pThis is a big project, so for brevity I removed all the extra methodsvariables. p  pOptimizer has a pointer to a PredictionRenderer object, predictionRenderer. This pointer is initialized during the call to the constructor. The pointer is private, and I checked and made sure that it cant get out that is, no one outside this Optimizer object can get ahold of this pointer. It is never returned by any of optimizers methods and it is never passed to any method by an optimizer method. p  pWhen attempting to delete the Optimizer object, my program segfaults on the delete predictionRenderer line. Execution never makes it into the PredictionRenderer deconstructor. I added in the print statement before the delete call to verify that the pointer was not NULL or already deleted, and the call to PredictionRenderers getWidth method returns successfully, which suggests that it must be a valid pointer is it possible to call a method of a deleted object. Also, the print statement is only printed out once, so Im pretty sure that the Optimizer object isnt being copied and deleted twice. Finally, the deconstructor for PredictionRenderer is never called, not by delete or anywhere else.p  pI have not idea what could be causing this. Does anyone have any insight into what is going onp  pEdit As I mentioned in the comments, this code base is big. I apologize for not showing much, but I cant really show everything as there just isnt enough space. This is someone elses code that Im using, and from what I can tell, he never actually destructs this object, he just lets it get deallocated when the program quits. I could do this too, but it seems like a hack and not a good way to do business.p

Negative 10474 pIm having a strange problem in a game Im building in Qt where each time I generate I call qrand or rand, I tried both, a separate tiny window pops up and steals focus from my game.

Negative 10474 pHey everyone so basically I have a main timer which keeps track of how long the player has until the game is over. If the timer is done counting down then the game is over. I also have items on the stage as well as purchases to add more time to the clock so they can keep playing. p  pThe bug that I am encountering is that when the player adds more time to the timer it shows on the text field that time was added and it continues to count down but it doesnt actually add more time and still ends after 60 seconds. p  pWhat could be causing this issue here is my current code below thanksp  pIn my constructor p  precodeCount down timer count  60 Count down from Number tCountDownTimer  new Timer1000, count Timer intervall in ms updateCountdownTimer  tCountDownTimer.addEventListenerTimerEvent.TIMER, countdownEventListener for intervalls tCountDownTimer.addEventListenerTimerEvent.TIMERCOMPLETE, countdownComplete codepre  pHere is my codecountdowncode Timer eventp  precodeprivate function countdowneTimerEventvoid            Display Time in a textfield on stage          updateCountdownTimer   public function updateCountdownTimervoid           cntDowntxt.countDownTextField.text  Stringcount  tCountDownTimer.currentCount   codepre  pIn a seperate function when the player touches the clock this is how I add more timep  precodecount  10 updateCountdownTimer codepre  pCould you see what I am doing wrongp

Negative 10474 pI have been searching for this error all over the internet but no matter what I try to fix this problem nothing actually works. And the detailed message that I got after I copied a url from fiddler and put it in the browser and is as follows.p  pModule IIS Web Corep  pNotification BeginRequestp  pHandler Not yet determinedp  pError Code 0x80070003p  pConfig Error Cannot read configuration filep  pConfig File Cinetpubwwwrootmyservicesweb.configp  pActually what has happened in the past that I had this service called myservices working all fine when I used visual studio to create a virtual directory for it in IIS.  But then what I did, I tried to do a web deploy of this service in IIS and removed myservices from Default Web Site tree which I had created by creating a virtual directory from within VS 2013. And  what I observed is,  that after  I web deployed myservices it didnt work the same way as it was working previously when  I created a virtual directory for myservices in IIS through VS2013 but had it removed to see whether the web deployed version of it would behave the same way. Therefore when I analyzed the cause of HTTP error 500.19  through Fiddler for the web deployed service it said Config Error Cannot read configuration file and  Config File Cinetpubwwwrootmyservicesweb.config but when I physically try to look into the folder Cinetpubwwwroot I could never find myservices  folder as such what to talk of web.config file in it. Then I manually created a folder called myservices in Cintepubwwwroot directory and put my web.config file there to see if the web deployed service would still work, but it didnt. Then I removed this folder called myservices and obviously the web.config file inside of it and also removed the web deployed service from Default Web Site Tree.p  pAnd now after all this mess even if I go to visual studio and try to create a virtual directory for my service myservices I can see it in Default Web Site Tree in IIS  but it would throw the same error as http 500.19 as the web deployed version of this service. In other words whatever I tried it messed up my services even when its not a web deployed version  which previously was not the case. I literally request everybody out there to please guidesuggest me with whatever experience they have as to what went wrong in all this trial and error endeavor of mine.p  pThanksp

I dont get any errors, and there are no errors in the FireBug console.p  pI have read other posts where people have actually received an error, possibly because they were using an old version of DataTables with the new init function, or vice versa, but thats not the case for me.p  pI even debugged the source file for YADCF and I can see the code getting called that creates the elements to be added to the table header, but for some reason I never see anything in the table itself. p  pThe serverside config should be irrelevant in this instance as it only provides the data for the table, and has nothing to do with the visual configuration of the table. So I dont think the issue is there.p  pPlease help.p

Negative 10474 pI want users to be able to do regex search that spans over multiple terms, however the regexp query only searches within terms. I have tried to do codeindex    notanalyzedcode but the problem is that Im indexing entire files and they are too long to fit in the ElasticSearch limit for a single term 32766. I cant split it up because that breaks the regex which is the problem. I either need a way to be able to search across multiple terms, or a way to index larger than 32766 files.p

Negative 10474 pstrongTLDRstrong Custom viewtemplate only sometimes calls custom model method. Sometimes wrong result with no print messages from method and sometimes right result with print messages from method.p  pIm new to Mezzanine more used to Pyramid and am having a weird nondeterministic problem with some template rendering. Ive created a Mezzanine project with a internal Django app for adding 3 new types Experiment Page, RichText, Instrument Page, RichText, DailyStatus Displayable, Ownable, RichText. Ive defined a ForeignKey on the DailyStatus to link it to a single Experiment.p  pSince DailyStatus isnt a subclass of Page Ive created my own view and my own template extending base.html. This template takes a lot from the blog detail template since a DailyStatus serves a similar purpose. In the template I call two methods to get the previous and next DailyStatus within an Experiment codegetpreviousbystatusdatecode and codegetnextbystatusdatecode which use the DailyStatus codestatusdatecode DateField.p  pSometimes when I visit a daily status page the prevnext buttons work as expected showing the next status in an experiment or not showing any if firstlast in an experiment. But other times, when the server restartsreloads, it seems to be choosing the prevnext by publishdate or just not working. It never switches these states during a single instance of the server. Ive used pdb and ipdb to try to debug this and have come to the point where calling codedailystatusinst.getpreviousbystatusdatecode produces the wrong result and codedailystatusinst.getnextorpreviousbystatusdateFalsecode produces the right result. The context between the correct state and wrong states doesnt seem to be any different I dumped the dicts to a file. Ive added print to the individual prevnext methods and sometimes they dont even seem to get called no output but they return an incorrect value.p  pDoes anyone have any idea whats going on Or any other helpful debug tips My DailyStatus model is belowp  precodeclass DailyStatusDisplayable, Ownable, RichText     experiment  models.ForeignKeyExperiment, relatednamedailystatuses     statusdate  models.DateFieldStatus Date      class Meta         verbosename  Daily Status         verbosenameplural  Daily Statuses         ordering  statusdate,         orderwithrespectto  experiment      def strself         return self.title      def getabsoluteurlself         from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse         return reversedailystatusdetail,                        kwargs                            experiment self.experiment.slug,                            slug self.slug,                              def getnextorpreviousbystatusdateself, isnext, kwargs         arg  statusdategt if isnext else statusdatelt         order  statusdate if isnext else statusdate         lookup  arg self.statusdate, experiment self.experiment         try             queryset  DailyStatus.objects.published         except AttributeError             queryset  DailyStatus.objects.all         try             dstatus  querysetkwargs.filterlookup.orderbyorder[0]             return dstatus         except IndexError             return False      def getnextbystatusdateself, kwargs         dstatus  self.getnextorpreviousbystatusdateTrue, kwargs         return dstatus      def getpreviousbystatusdateself, kwargs         dstatus  self.getnextorpreviousbystatusdateFalse, kwargs         return dstatus codepre  pSimplest Templatep  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt ltheadgt ltbodygt      dailystatus.getpreviousbystatusdate      ltpgtltpgt      dailystatus.getnextbystatusdate  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pUsingp  precode Mezzanine 3.1.10  Django 1.6.11  Python 3.4.3  SQLite 3.8.10.1  Darwin 14.3.0 codepre  pThanks for any help.p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pIve tracked it down to the prevnext methods being codecurriedcode or not.

Negative 10474 pI have a client that sells cheesecakes via an online ecommerce store. Now there are some limitations when discussing the shipping. My main question is can we apply the following rules in woocommerce so we dont have any shipping issues. p  pOkay so a short breakdown is no order can be in transit for more than 3 days. The cheesecake goes bad after 72 hours. Also we do not ship out on saturday or sunday. This also means there is no way an order can be delivered on monday as well. You can order on Monday but not receive. Also any order after 12 PM CST will not ship out till the next day. p  pSo now the regions. We have 3 ground options for shipping. 1 day shipping, 2 day shipping, and 3 day shipping. Now if you want the order in Cali it takes us 3 days ground to get there, but lets say that I ordered a cake today and it needed to be in cali tomorrow then the only option that should show up is next day air. None of the ground options should be available. Same thing if they wanted a cake in Denver which would take 2 days. Only option that should be available if they want ground is either 2 day ground or 3 day ground, depending on what date they choose to receive it. Now this can get complicated explaining so if you need some more information please let me know. Only thing Im trying to find out is if this can be done in woocommerce, and if so what options do I have.p

Negative 10474 pI am trying to create a trigger in Oracle that adds the usernames full name after inserting into a table. I have already a trigger that adds the username in a ADDEDBY column after inserting into a table and my idea is basically to add the usernames full name into a new column FULLNAME where FULLNAME  ADDEDBY.p  pThis is what I have come with so far.

In this environment many people use the database to create objects for example drawing polygons that represent buildings and houses and it becomes necessary in such an environment to keep track of who did what in the form of metadata. Suppose that there is a land surveyor whose name is George Clooney and he has the username GEOCLO in the database. When that user creates an object in the database, a trigger is fired to insert the value GEOCLO in a column called ADDEDBY this trigger already exists in the database today so that when people click on that object they know that it was created by the land surveyor Georgoe Clooney. p  pThe problem is, after a couple of years George Clooney might change his role in the company and another person comes in and probably the manager of the GIS department changes their job  so it becomes difficult to know who GEOCLO iswas What I want to do is whenever George Clooney creates an object, a trigger is fired that inserts the value George Clooney to a column that is called FULLNAME, just as the other trigger inserts the value GEOCLO to the ADDEDBY column. p  pWhat I was able to do so far, as mentioned in the original question, is to add the full name of strongone userstrong to the FULLNAME column after that user creates a new object and the question is how to add the names of the other users, in the same trigger, when they create new objects Hope that the question is a little bit more clear now. p

Negative 10474 pI wrote a small application to try to display the protocol headers of captured packets. All my packets are captured with libpcaps pcaploop. The way my program works is as follows I wrote my own headers based of the structures defined in ifether.h ip.h and tcp.h. pcaploop sets a char pointer to the beginning of the packet, and I then step through the packet, casting to the appropriate structure each time, and incrementing the pointer by the size of the header. Now its important to remember my question isnt code specific my code works but there are logical flaws I dont undestand Keep in mind my packets are sent over the same machine, different portI wrote  tiny python server that I send data to with telnetp  p1.the ethernet header doesnt display anything that looks correct when packets are sent over localhost When I use my program on internet packets, MAC adresses are dosplayed correctly thoughp  p2.Through trial and error, Ive determined that the structure iphdr starts exactly 16 bytes after the start of the packet buffer, as opposed to the expected 14 bytes, the size of the ethernet headerp  pThose observations lead me to ask the following questions When packets are sent over local host, do we use another protocol on layer 2 Is there anything at all that separates the packet headers  Are the iphdr and tcphdr structures defined in ip.h and tcp.h obsolete p

While transferring data, I noticed that all nodes were stopped amp continue moving after finish transferring data to RSU.p  pMy question is, how to make that node still moving while transferring data Is it possible p  pThis is because, I want to know the percentage the data was sent according to the velocity of a node. Can somebody help mep
Negative 10474 pWhen load testing a web app, I can either p  ol lisend synchronous requests in multiple threads, or li liuse an asynchronous client and handle response in callbacks. li ol  pWith the multithread approach, requests within the same thread are only sent after the last response is received. Concurrency is achieved through threads.p  pWith the asynchronous approach, concurrent requests are sent in quick succession. However, requests has to be sent periodically, giving the event loop enough time to handle the responses.p  pFor example, using python, I can either use coderequestscode to send requests synchronous, or I can use codetwistedcode or codetornadocodes asynchronous HTTP client.p  pWhich is the way to go with load testingp

Negative 10474 pI am writing a calendar GUI in Ruby using a hrefhttpshoesrb.com relnofollowShoesa. Everything was going well with all of its features, until I got to the part where I wanted to style the boxes I had created. I was using basic ShoesShapes at first for placeholder, but after reading through the documentation I decided this was going to be undoable. I then tried to do the border solution, but that too didnt seem to work very well. Here is a very basic example of what I am trying to achieve. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comO7BvH.png altexamplep  pThe boxes must function as both clickable so a button, and an element whos contents can be changed. What, if any, is the best way to achieve this in Shoes Will I have to ditch Shoes and pursue some other GUI framework insteadp

Negative 10474 pIm trying to use multiprocessing in Python to have a function keep getting called within a loop, and subsequently access the latest return value from the function by storing the values in a LIFO Queue.p  pHere is a code snippet from the main programp  precodeq  Queue.LifoQueue while True    p  multiprocessing.ProcesstargetmyFunc, args  q    p.daemon  True    p.start    if not q.empty       do something with q.get codepre  pAnd heres a code snippet from myFuncp  precodedef myFuncq     x  calc     q.putx codepre  pThe problem is, the main loop thinks that q is empty. However, Ive checked to see if myFunc is placing values into q by putting a q.empty check right after the q.putx and the queue shouldnt be empty. p  pWhat can I do so that the main loop can see the values placed in the queue Or am I going about this in an inefficient way I do need myFunc and the main loop to be run separately though, since myFunc is a bit slow and the main loop needs to keep performing its taskp
Negative 10474 pIve just begun my journey into the realms of the CherryPy module in Python.

Negative 10474 pUsing node.js, I decided it was time to work with file uploads. Looking at my options, I felt that uploading with socketio was the best bet for me. This of course brought my list of modules down with not being able to use multer or other ways that require you to load another http request. I finally settled with strongsocket.iostreamstrong and everything was working great until I tried uploading bigger files 200 KB or bigger which is not that great being that the average size of stuff that will be uploaded is anything from 50 KB to 700 KB with the max of 1MB. It seems to me that the upload is ending prematurely without any clue on why. Although I feel like the problem is server side, here is both the client and server.p  pClientp  precodevar file  map.propfiles[0]         var stream  ss.createStream         ssm.emitfile, stream, name file.name codepre  pServerp  precode   sssocket.onfile, functionstream, data              var filename  path.basenamedata.name             var way  imagesmapsuploaded             stream.pipefs.createWriteStreampublicwayfilename             stream.onend, function                  socket.emitfileDone, ltimg src  way  filename   height200px width400pxgt                        codepre  pAs you can probably tell the main function will be to upload images. The client side works so Im not worried about that. On the server side, I will get the file and then save it in the uploaded directory. The stream.on is for a callback to show the uploaded image after it is done. p  pWhen uploading most big files over 200KB it only partially works like the picture below and ones that tend to be bigger than 700KB will show a size 0 after uploading. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comjmmZl.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjmmZl.jpg altExample of bad uploadap

Negative 10474 pIm sorting an array of objects. The objects have lots of fields but I only care about one of them. So, I wrote a comparatorp  precode    Collections.sortdetails, new ComparatorltMyObjgt          Override         public int compareMyObj d1, MyObj d2              if d1.getDate  null ampamp d2.getDate  null                  return 0              else if d1.getDate  null                  return 1              else if d2.getDate  null                  return 1                           if d1.getDate.befored2.getDate return 1             else if d1.getDate.afterd2.getDate return 1             else return 0               codepre  pFrom the perspective of my use case, this codeComparatorcode does all it needs to, even if I might consider this sorting nondeterministic. However, I wonder if this is bad code. Through this codeComparatorcode, two very distinct objects could be considered the same ordering even if they are unequal objects. I decided to use codehashCodecode as a tiebreaker, and it came out something like thisp  precode    Collections.sortdetails, new ComparatorltMyObjgt          Override         public int compareMyObj d1, MyObj d2               if d1.getDate  null ampamp d2.getDate  null                  return d1.hashCode              else if d1.getDate  null                  return 1              else if d2.getDate  null                  return 1                           if d1.getDate.befored2.getDate return 1             else if d1.getDate.afterd2.getDate return 1             else return d1.hashCode  d2.hashCode               codepre  pwhat I return might be backwards, but thats is not important to this questionp  pIs this necessaryp  pstrongEDITstrong To anyone else looking at this question, consider using Googles ordering API.
