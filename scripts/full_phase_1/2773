Negative 2773 pIve found a unmaintained program I have a need for, but its not perfect, so I would like to fork it and to continue fixing it. The current version is licensed under the GPL version 2 and up, but I would prefer to integrate my version with some other code I wrote, licensed under the MIT, and combine them all to a usable library. p  pThe program is written in Perl, which I intend to rewrite in Ruby, so it would not just be a fork of the existing code, but also a translation.p  pIdeally, I would like to license the entire thing under the MIT license, but Im not sure if thats allowed. And since I wrote the code I want to merge with, I could easily just relicense that as GPL, even though I prefer the MIT license. So, is there any easy way to do thisp

Negative 2773 pWhile trying to get a 2008 server to connect to a sql server, I noticed a change in the 2008 IP stack that has me a bit flummoxed.

Thus, the firewall rules were met and access was granted. Under 2008, it appears that its picking the closest matchp  pConnecting to 10.10.10.2 comes from IP 10.10.10.1. Firewall is happy. Connecting to 10.10.10.15 comes from IP 10.10.10.11, firewall denies connections.p  pRemoving all virtual IPS from the NIC of course makes things work because every will then come fro 10.10.10.1p  pNow, I understand slightly that were this machine to have two NICs, this makes sense because of changes to implement RFC3484 and IPv6 a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb968920 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb968920a and strongweak host model comes into play, but for the life of me, I dont understand why this should have changed how IP works with a single NIC card.p  pI have a support case open and Im getting nowhere. I hear muttering of just open up your firewall to allow connections from 10.10.10.11. Thats not practical. This would mean adding a allow rule for every ip address on a multihomed single nic machine just for windows 2008. I cant believe poking more holes in your firewall just for 2008s ip stack is a good answer.p  pIs there a way to disable this feature in 2008 at the machine level Is there a way to disable this in .NET at the machine level Is there a way to disable this per connection SqlConnection, WebClientp

Negative 2773 pI have a GridView that contains a list of files, created dates, and file sizes.  Below the grid I have a textblock that says X Files Selected.  Y MB.

Negative 2773 pI am using LINQ to insert records in the database. I create these records and keep track of them using a List. Based on some logic, I delete some of the records by deleting from the List. I am using the same DataContext object. p  pWhen I want to insert the records in the database, I do the corresponding linq tables InsertOnSubmit followed by SubmitChanges on datacontext object. LINQ inserts the deletedfromList records too along with the ones that are present in the list. p  pexamplep  precodelist to keep track of records to insert List list   add the records to list list.addsome records  deleted last 2 records list.remove  call InsertAllOnSubmit on the linq table passing the list object with records to insert linqTable.InsertAllOnSubmitlist  call SubmitChanges on datacontext object datacontext.SubmitChanges codepre  pI came across this msdn article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb386982.aspx relnofollowObject States and ChangeTracking LINQ to SQLa p  blockquote   pYou can explicitly request Inserts by   using InsertOnSubmit. Alternatively,   LINQ to SQL can infer Inserts by   finding objects connected to one of   the known objects that must be   updated. For example, if you add an   Untracked object to an   EntitySetTEntity or set an   EntityRefTEntity to an Untracked   object, you make the Untracked object   reachable by way of tracked objects in   the graph. While processing   SubmitChanges, LINQ to SQL traverses   the tracked objects and discovers any   reachable persistent objects that are   not tracked. Such objects are   candidates for insertion into the   database.p blockquote  pI guess the question boils down to this  how do I change the deleted objects state to Untracked p  pI tried DeleteOnSubmit after I delete the objects from list but that gives an exception Cannot remove an entity that has not been attached.p  pCan someone please point me to a solution Thanks. p  pI would like to know if I can achieve this using LINQ only. I know that I can use an stored proc and insert only the records in the list.p

Negative 2773 pId like to parse large XML files and read in a complete node at a time from Java. The files are to large to put in a tree. Id like to use a pull parser if possible since it appears to be easier to program for. Given the following XML databr                  Instead of having to check every event while using the StAX parser Id like each call to hasNext or some similar function to return an object containing the complete info on a record node. When using Perl XMLLibXMLReader allows me to do this using its read method so Im looking for an equivalent in Java.p

Negative 2773 pI recently added a feature to a large application written in Delphi version 2009 that allows the user to drag files from Windows explorer and drop them on a TcxGrid control. I achieved this via the common method of attaching my own window proc to the grid and intercepting the WMDROPFILES messagep  precode originalGridWindowProc  cxGrid.WindowProc  remember the old one  cxGrid.WindowProc  GridWindowProc   assign the new one  DragAcceptFilescxGrid.Handle, LongBoolTrue  setup to accept dropped files codepre  pI now am trying to enhance this feature to detect when the user drops a file onto an existing row in the grid, which will begin the process of overwriting an existing file with a new version. p  pMy first thought was to see if the grid controls mouseover event would work. It does, but not during the drag operation. p  pI then used a program called Winspector to see what messages were being sent to the grid control as the mouse is moved over the grid, and I can now detect what row the mouse is over and highlight it. Im using the same technique as above, but in this case I am overriding the window proc for the GridSite and not the grid itself, because that is where the messages appear to be going according to Winspectorp  precode  originalGridSiteWindowProc  cxGrid.ActiveView.Site.WindowProc   cxGrid.ActiveView.Site.WindowProc  GridSiteWindowProc codepre  pHere is the body of GridSiteWindowProcp  precodeprocedure Tfrm.GridSiteWindowProcvar message TMessage var   hitTest TcxCustomGridHitTest   gridRecord TcxCustomGridRecord begin   LogIntToStrmessage.Msg   case message.Msg of     WMNCHITTEST begin       hitTest  cxGrid.ActiveView.GetHitTestcxGrid.ScreenToClientMouse.CursorPos       if hitTest is TcxGridRecordCellHitTest then begin         gridRecord  TcxGridRecordCellHitTestHitTest.GridRecord         if Not gridRecord.Focused then           gridRecord.Focused  True       end       originalGridSiteWindowProcmessage     end     else       originalGridSiteWindowProcmessage   end end codepre  pAs you can see, Im trapping the WMNCHITTEST message to achieve this. According to Winspector, this message also gets sent to the grid site window during the drag operation, but if I uncomment that Log statement which will output the message value to a string list which I manually dump to a memo field afterwards, I have determined that for some reason, I only get one or two of these messages when dragging a file over the grid. p  pNow  heres the interesting part if I have Winspector running and monitoring messages going to that window, I suddenly start getting all the WMNCHITTEST messages during the file drag operation. This is also the case if I output the integer value of all the messages coming to the window proc directly to a separate log window instead of to a string list buffer first. I am hoping that someone will be able to offer some clue as to why this is happening or how to get this to work. p

This poses a real problem for us since we dont want traffic on port 15000 because that channel may not be bound to the same network adapter as the port 50000 channel on the server or that port may not be open in the firewall, which causes the remoting calls to fail naturally.p  pThis is very strange to us since the client has no knowledge in our code that there exists another channel on the server on port 15000 or what IP it listens on, yet it attempt to connect to it.p  pAny help on this is greatly appreciated,p  pThanks, Casperp  pThis is the code that sets up one of the server channels, the one usually on port 50000p  precodeIDictionary props  new Hashtable  props[port]  mtcpPort props[name]  String.Empty   BinaryServerFormatterSinkProvider serverProvider  new BinaryServerFormatterSinkProvider serverProvider.TypeFilterLevel  System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.TypeFilterLevel.Full  BinaryClientFormatterSinkProvider clientProvider  new BinaryClientFormatterSinkProvider  mtcpChannel  new TcpServerChannel props, clientProvider, serverProvider  ChannelServices.RegisterChannel mtcpChannel, false   mwellKnownObjRef  RemotingServices.Marshal this, Server  mtcpPort.ToString  codepre  pThis is the code that sets up the other server channel, usually on port 15000p  precodeIDictionary props  new Hashtable  props[name]  String.Empty props[port]  ip.Port props[bindTo]  ip.Address.ToString                     props[timeout]  REMOTINGTIMEOUT  Timeout to prevent hung remoting calls.  if String.IsNullOrEmpty machineName       props[machineName]  machineName       BinaryServerFormatterSinkProvider serverProvider  new BinaryServerFormatterSinkProvider     serverProvider.TypeFilterLevel  System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.TypeFilterLevel.Full      BinaryClientFormatterSinkProvider clientProvider  new BinaryClientFormatterSinkProvider      mchannel  new TcpChannel props, clientProvider, serverProvider      ChannelServices.RegisterChannel mchannel, false       mobjRef  RemotingServices.Marshal this, QueueName   Queuename is a GUID. codepre  pThis is the code in the client that connects to the first server channel, the one thats usually on port 50000p  precodeIDictionary props  new Hashtable  props[port]  0  RemotingConfiguration.CustomErrorsMode  CustomErrorsModes.Off  BinaryServerFormatterSinkProvider serverProvider  new BinaryServerFormatterSinkProvider serverProvider.TypeFilterLevel  System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.TypeFilterLevel.Full  BinaryClientFormatterSinkProvider clientProvider  new BinaryClientFormatterSinkProvider  mtcpChannel  new TcpClientChannelprops, clientProvider, serverProvider ChannelServices.RegisterChannelmtcpChannel, false   string address  tcp  profile.RemoteIP    profile.RemoteTCP  mserver  KernelActivator.GetObjecttypeofServer, address  Server  port codepre

The problem is that it handles the keys itself and there is no way documented to get them.

Also it seems that MotoDev Studio will lock you out of new features such as shared libraries.p  pbUPDATE 532011bbr  They have been actually really quick and prompt at updating MotoDev Studio but it seems like I believe that Google should still provide a work around for those that want to change the certificates of their applications.

I need to build an interpreter to translate this code to html and posteriorly insert it into C, so that it can be compiled. The C part stays intact. Inside the wdi source it is not necessary to use prints, every return statement will be used for output in printf function. The programs output will be clean html code.p  pSo, for example a heading 1 tag would be transformed like thisp  precodeh1  Hello,   toCapitalname     would become printflth1gtHello, slth1gt, toCapitalname codepre  pMy main goal is to create an interpreter to translate wdi source to html like thisp  pcodetagattributes contentcode  codelttag attributesgtcontentlttaggtcodep  pSecondly, html code returned by the interpreter has to be inserted into C code with printfs.

Negative 2773 pI have a multithreaded application that spawns threads for several hardware instruments. Each thread is basically an infinite loop for the lifetime of the application that polls the hardware for new data, and activates an event which passes the data each time it collects something new. There is a single listener class that consolidates all these instruments, performs some calculations, and fires a new event with this calculation.p  pHowever, Im wondering if, since there is a single listener, it would be better to expose an codeIEnumerableltgtcode method off these instruments, and use a codeyield returncode to return the data, instead of firing events.p  pId like to see if anybody knows of differences in these two methods.

Negative 2773 pOK, so maybe I am really missing something here, but how is it so difficult to do effective server amp client side validation in MVC 2 Here are a few examplesp  ol lipI want to use a variable length list. I follow a great tutorial like Steve Sandersons variable length list overview. I want to create a custom validator like RequiredIf. My variable length list is a collection using Sandersons HTML helper for collections, and the custom validators dont fire even with the correct client validation scripts inplace that work fine for nonvariable length lists... isnt a variable length list that needs to post back as an enumerable collection to the [HttpPost] action pretty common Why is this validation so painful on the client sidewhen you wish to derive from the validation annotation that was associated with your class In this case, serverside validation actually works... but clientside seems to be impossible when using a collection and a variablelength list. Sure this could be something to do with the HTML element ID naming from the indexGuids of the collection, but it starts to get so convoluted...pli lipI have a ViewModel that may be filled with different types of data. I want to validate in some cases, but not in others. Typically I am filling my ViewModel from a domain class that already has data annotations for validation. However, the ViewModel would need its own data annotations to perform validation correctly. For some fields I want validation, but for other uses of the same fieldwhen filled with different dataI dont want validation. I cannot reference a dynamic property in my data validation annotation though... annotations are static. This must be based on when they bind, etc. Sure I can make a custom validator that gets REALLY crazy and actually references the literal values of other fields in its attempt to decide whether to validate drawing in booleans for required, and strings for regex or errormessages... but ouch Seriously, is it this hardpli ol  pWhat is frustrating is that the more I try to follow the patterns provided by MVC, I keep stumbling into things that COULD be so darn simple but get so painful when you cant deviate from the pattern. If data validation annotation is the correct approach, it really seems like it needs to support dynamically set properties and have a better autorendering of client JS specifically for custom validators to avoid these headaches. Im almost done trying to make clientside validation work in these situations.p  pHas anyone used a validation package that makes this process easier I am not familiar enough with the support for the MVC 2 compatible validation packages to know whether theyre worthwhile. Ive skimmed Fluent Validation for example, but need to learn more. Does it allow dynamic validation assignment and client valdiation for custom validatorsp  pOne idea I am considering is simply adding data fields in my domain model that provide a viewusable string which a package like JQuery validation can pickup and use to avoid this entire situation mentioned above. That way my domain model can use annotations to protect its data integrity and will serve as a laststop for any insert issue, and my client side can just have a string to throw into a class attribute for a scripted validator to use without having to go through the craziness of exposing custom validators on the clientside with a bunch of overkillinterpretation of IEnumerable GetClientValidationRules... p  pWhat gives Is there a better wayp

Negative 2773 pIve written the rudiments of a class for creating dynamic structures in C. Dynamic structure members are stored contiguously with as far as my tests indicate the same padding that the compiler would insert in the equivalent static structure. Dynamic structures can thus be implicitly converted to static structures for interoperability with existing APIs.p  pForemost, I dont trust myself to be able to write Boostquality code that can compile and work on more or less any platform. What parts of this code are dangerously in need of modificationp  pI have one other designrelated question Is a templated codegetcode accessor the only way of providing the compiler with the requisite static type information for typesafe code As it is, the user of codedynamicstructcode must specify the type of the member they are accessing, whenever they access it. If that type should change, emallem of the accesses become invalid, and will either cause spectacular crashesmdashor worse, fail silently. And it cant be caught at compile time.

Whereas decorators are not quite independent of the clients they decorate. In fact, they are of same supertype as the object they decorate. Am I missing a point herep

Negative 2773 pI consider using CLR trigger instead of traditional TSQL one because I need to use some logic that is already implemented in C. Im aware that SQL server supports CLR integration and in my case it seems like a solution thats worth a shot.p  pHowever, the operations I want to perform can be somewhat slow. Not slow enough to rule out using them in triggered actions completely, but probably noticeably slow when it comes to inserting hundreds of thousands of records. The slowest part can strongly benefit from caching, I suppose that it will be very few cache misses and thousands of cache hits. At this point it all leads to a question can CLR triggers have any state And, more important, whats the life cycle of this statep  pI suppose I could use static fields of trigger class to hold some state, but I have no idea when it gets initialized When the server is started At transaction start Not specified. I am not sure if its the safe route and therefore ask what the common practices for using some state in CLR triggers are if any.p  pTo avoid confusion I need to cache strongCLR objectsstrong, not the results of some SQL queries, so its not about how good SQL Server itself is at caching, I want to cache some data that doesnt belong to database. Also, I consider CLR not because I cant do string manipulations and bound checking in TSQL. I need to execute some logic that is implemented in CLR class library and has a lot of dependencies. Wether I should use triggers in this case is another question that has almost nothing to do with this one.p  pMany thanks in advance.p  pstrongPSstrong I will appreciate any comments and insights on topic, even the ones that dont answer my question directly, but please dont make it all about triggers are evil and shouldnt ever be used and CLR integration is slow and a major compatibility pain. Also, I know that it may scream premature optimization to someone, but at the moment I just want to know what my optimization options are going in since Im new to CLR integration in SQL server. I wont optimize it unless profiling results suggest so, but I dont want to implement the whole thing  to realize its too slow and there is nothing I can do about it.p  pI use SQL Server 2008 and .NET 3.5.p
Negative 2773 pWhat is the best way to have a WCF host access multiple databases without passing the name after the WCF client has been initiated I am using DI and want to do something likep  precodewcfCourseManagement.CourseManagementClient wcfclient  null  public WCFCourseRepositoryISystemService systemService basesystemService      wcfclient  new wcfCourseManagement.CourseManagementClient         ServiceEndpoint endpoint  systemService.GetServiceEndpointCourseManagement     if endpoint  null         wcfclient.Endpoint.Address  new EndpointAddressnew Uriendpoint.Endpoint     if wcfclient.GetRemoteSystemID  systemService.ClientSystem.PreferredRemoteSystemID         wcfclient.SetCurrentSystemsystemService.ClientSystem.PreferredRemoteSystemID  codepre  pThe SetCurrentSystem would tell the WCF host that it should rebuild the data repositories if need be. The system ID is just an ID into a config store the server uses to load database configuration information. However, due to the design of the WCF host wiring the default SystemID is injected during the parameterless construction of the host. I want to override that but I do not wish to pass that in every call because that would rip apart the current repository interfaces, shared by client and server code. What is the most direct way to accomplish this type of behaviorp

Negative 2773 pI wanted, just to learn a bit about Iteratees, reimplement a simple parser I made, using Data.Iteratee and Data.Attoparsec.Iteratee. Im pretty much stumped though. Below I have a simple example that is able to parse emoneem line from a file. My parser reads one line at a time, so I need a way of feeding lines to the iteratee until its done. Ive read all Ive found googling this, but a lot of the material on iterateeenumerators is pretty advanced. This is the part of the code that mattersp  precode There are more imports above. import Data.Attoparsec.Iteratee import Data.Iteratee joinI, run import Data.Iteratee.IO defaultBufSize, enumFile  line  Parser ByteString  left the implementation out it doesnt check for                               new line  iter  parserToIteratee line  main  do     p lt liftM head getArgs     i lt enumFile defaultBufSize p  iter     i lt run i     print i codepre  pThis example will parse and print one line from a file with multiple lines. The original script mapped the parser over a list of ByteStrings. So I would like to do the same thing here. I found codeenumLinescodein Iteratee, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to use it. Maybe I misunderstand its purposep

Negative 2773 pI am new to .NET UI stuff and I came from a background with tk UI programming so I am trying to find corresponding ways of doing things. Maybe .NET has a way of achieving the same result that I dont know of.p  pSo what I am trying to do is roughly illustrated in image a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comWxzoQ.png relnofollow1a.p  pWe have a header section, a body section and a footer section. They each have a number of controls in them. What I am trying to find is a way for me to let header section and footer section each take a certain height and stretch horizontally let body section stretch to fill the rest. Is there a way to do this without needing to calculate the point position and just say pack header towards the top, pack footer towards the bottom and put body in betweenp

Negative 2773 pIve got a whole bunch of minidumps which were recorded during the runtime of an application through MiniDumpWriteDump. The minidumps were created on a machine with a different OS version than my development machine.p  pNow Im trying to write a program to extract stack traces from the minidumps, using dbghelp.dll. Im walking the MINIDUMPMODULELIST and call SymLoadModule64, but this fails to download the pdbs kernel32 etc. from the public symbol server. If I add CWindowsSystem32 to the symbol path it finds the dlls and downloads the symbols, but of course they dont match the dlls from the minidump, so the results are useless.p  pSo how do I tell dbghelp.dll to download and use the proper pdbsp  pstrong[edit]strongp  pI forgot to state that SymLoadModule64 only takes a filename and no versionchecksum information, so obviously with SymLoadModule64 alone its impossible for dbghelp to figure out which pdb to download.p  pThe information is actually available in the MINIDUMPMODULELIST but I dont know how to pass it back to the dbghelp API.p  pThere is SymLoadModuleEx which takes additional parameters, but I have no idea if thats what I need or what I should pass for the additional parameters.p  pstrong[edit]strongp  pNo luck so far, though Ive noticed theres also dbgeng.dll distributed together with dbghelp.dll in the debugging SDK. MSDN looks quite well documented and says its the same engine as windbg uses. Maybe I can use that to extract the stack traces.p  pIf anyone can point me to some introduction to using dbgeng.dll to process minidumps that would probably help too, as the MSDN documents only the individual components but not how they work together.p

Negative 2773 pPython is supposed to be strongly typed. p  pFor instance codeabc[1]code wont work, because youre expected to provide an integer there, not a string. An error wil be raised and you can go on and correct it.p  pBut thats not the case with hashlib. Indeed, try the followingp  precodeimport hashlib hashlib.md5abc Works OK          hashlib.md51  Traceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt TypeError md5 argument 1 must be string or readonly buffer, not int  hashlib.md5uabc Works, but shouldnt  this is unicode, not str.  haslib.md5u Traceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt UnicodeEncodeError ascii codec cant encode character uxe9 in position 0 ordinal not in range128 codepre  pOf course, it does not fail because of a codeTypeErrorcode, but because of codeUnicodeEncodeErrorcode. codeUnicodeEncodeErrorcode is supposed to be raised when you attempt to encode unicode to a string.p  pI think Im not too far from the truth when my guess is that Hashlib silently attempted to convert unicode to a string.p  pNow. I agree, hashlib indicated that the argument to codehashlib.md5code should be a string or a readonly buffer, which a unicode string is. But this actually goes to show that it actually is not codehashlib.md5code will work properly with strings and thats about it.p  pOf course, the main problem this causes is that you will get an exception with some unicode strings, and not with some others.p  pWhich leads me to my questions. First, do you have an explanation as to why hashlib implements this behavior Second, is it considered an issue Third, is there a way to fix this without changing the module itself p  pHashlib is basically an example, there are several other modules that behave the same when provided unicode strings  which leads you to an uncomfortable situation where your program will work with ASCII input but completely fail with accents.p

Negative 2773 pSorry if this seems like an easy question, Im quite new to C so Im a bit clueless on the easiest way to do this.p  pOur company needed a very simple Time and Attendance tracking software, and all the ones online seemed too expensive or have too many features that we will never need, so I decided to write my own. Pretty much, it will be a simple Windows Form App with a drop down menu with the names of employes, 2 check boxes, one for Clock In and one for Clock Out and a DateTime picker. I just want them to choose their name, check one of the boxes and hit the Clock InOut button. From there, Id want their name variable in the drop down menu, which box they checked In or Out and the DateTime from the picker to export into an excel spreadsheet or a Access Database file. p  pIs there a simple way to gather this data and export it, and is there an easy way to sort this data by weekp
Negative 2773 pI am working on an application that needs to support the multitenant model.  I am using the symfony2 php framework and doctrine2. p  pIm not sure the best way to go about architecting this requirement.  Does Symfonys ACL functionality provide a part of the solution  p  pWhat recommendations or ideas could you provide Are there any sample symfony2 applications or open source applications that are available which have implemented this strategy p  pMy first thought is to use a tenantid column in all the tables and have this relate to the account object in the application. Im not sure though if ACL is supposed to take care of what im wanting to do, or if your still responsible for all of the queries against your objects so they dont return unauthorized data. p  pIf I wasnt using Doctrine, it might be easy to say just append codeWhere tenantid  accountidcode to each query, but im not sure that is the right approach here. p  pThanks p

Negative 2773 pWe are developing several separate applicationsmodules, that we deploy onto Glassfish 3.1.1 application server. There are cases where these applications need to call each others methods, through a remote interface. What is the best practice when it comes to packaging these remote interfaces E.g. if A needs to call Bs remote interface, would you extract Bs remote interface in a separate JAR file and package it together with module A What if this remote interface references an entity class. Would you package this entity class together with the interface in this JAR filep  pIf you have any feedback on this topic, feel free to suggest how you think this should be done.p

For example, if I use [shift] number key to type a symbol such as  or amp, some re recorded while others such as [shift]9 which results in , are not recorded. So, Im wondering if I should use WMKEYDOWNWMKEYUP pair to handle keyboard input. I once wrote a keylogger in assemblyactually it was just a tutorial that i was trying out and had used WMKEYDOWNWMKEYUP pairs and that worked out quite good. So, should I move on to this, or is it something unusual that is happening with my program p  pThanks,p  pDevjeetp

Negative 2773 pIm experiencing a problem with a Classic ASP application Im maintaining the architect is long gone. Each customer site gets a virtual directory that corresponds to their database name  for example, a hrefhttpwww.site.comFoo relnofollowhttpwww.site.comFooa would be a site for customer Foo, and their database would also be named Foo. 11 mapping, very clear.p  pLets say that theres also a hrefhttpwww.site.comBar relnofollowhttpwww.site.comBara. The error Im getting very occasionally, under at least moderate load, is that POST requests to Bar are being saved in the Foo database.p  pIts worth noting here that the save action is subbed out to a .NET component instantiated with a Server.CreateObject call. This .NET class instance uses prea hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.enterpriseservices.contextutil28vVS.8029.aspx relnofollowSystem.EnterpriseServices.ContextUtila.GetNamedPropertyRequestpre to get a handle to the current request. The .NET code constructs everything about the save action based on this request.p  pMy working theory is that somehow, System.EnterpriseServices.ContextUtil and the .asp page that created the .NET component have different opinions about what the current request is. Is this possible I seem to have the idea that requests were handled one at a time, but I dont seem to be able to find an explicit answer to that.p  pI have tried putting all virtual directories into a single app pool, and each customer with their own  the problem occurs either way.p  pMy only other idea is that somehow a database connection pool item is being reused incorrectly, but the database connections are created with the database name as part of the  connection string, so I find that to be extremely unlikely.p  pThe server is running IIS 6, the database server is SQL Server 2000. Upgrade plans are already underway.p

Negative 2773 pHow does one prevent passwords and other sensitive data submitted to and received from ASP.NET web pages in IISASP.NET dump files   p  pstrongSteps to reproducestrongp  ol liUsing Visual Studio 2010, create a ASP.NET MVC 3 intranet application. li liConfigure it to use IIS 7.5. li liFire it up and register an account say bob123 as the user and Paw0Rd as the password. Im assuming that the SQL Express database is created and the site is fully functional.  li liUsing task manager, right click on the w3wp process and create a dump.  li liOpen the dump in an editor capable of displaying its contents as hex, such as SlickEdit. li liSearch for Pa0Rd and Pa2424w0Rd in the hex dump. You should be able to find several copies of it stored as ASCII, Unicode, or encoded. li ol  pNote that it doesnt matter whether you use HTTPS because it only encrypts the communication. ASP.NET stores that data in the clear in memory or disk.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pCommon wisdom has it to encrypt sensitive data and not to store it in the clear. However an employee may receive a dump of an IISASP.NET application and discover passwords and other confidential data of users because this information is neither encrypted, nor is memory used by ASP.NET cleared after usage. p  pThis puts them at risk simply because they have access to it. Dump are sometimes shared with partners such as Microsoft to help them diagnose issues in their code. It is a necessary part of diagnosing some really complex problems in ones application.p  pstrongThings I looked atstrongp  ol liUse SecureString for passwords and other sensitive data.  However, the ASP.NET Membership provider, along with other frameworks like WCF, often accepts passwords as System.String, which means that those copies will still be in the dump.li liLooked to see if there is anything in the framework to clear out a copy of System.String when it is no longer being used. I couldnt find anything.li liInvestigated whether one can zero out the memory used for requests and responses once IIS is done with it, but I was unable to find anything. li liI investigated wether one can encrypt files IIS receives as HttpPostFile so that they are not stored in the clear.  We may receive documents that are extremely confidential and every step is made to encrypt and protect them on the server. However, someone can extract them in the clear from an IIS dump.li ol  pWhat I was hoping for is to tell IISASP.NET that a specific requestresponse contains sensitive data and that IISASP.NET will clear out the memory when it is done using it. p
Negative 2773 pI know its good to be DRYDont Repeat Yourself, and Ive been incorporating lots of partials into my rails project. Well its convenient, but only when I can find them.p  pThe problem is my project has become large enough that its now taking much more time looking for partials than before. For example I come across a bug and try to fix it, but rails error log doesnt display exactly which partial its coming from. So I first go to the view, and try to find that code. However the code is not there. So I search for render just to find some partials to search from. There are too many partials at this stage that I dont even remember which partial I used to write certain code. So I have to go through each one of them every time this happens. Sometimes a partial has another partial inside it, in which case this becomes a depth first searchp  pI realized Ive been doing this much more frequently recently and am not getting anything done because of this inefficiency. I dont think Depth first search is the way to go.p  pI try using grep to search for keywords, but its slow.p  pI know there are lots of people who work on really huge projects and still manage to use DRYd up code. How do you do it Do you have your own knowhow to organize these partials, so that its easy to retrieve them when you need them later Or, what are some good ways to quickly find what Im looking for when debugging I currently use vim on a mac, along with NERDTree and ctrlp plugins.p

Negative 2773 pI recently ported a Qt app to use QTcpSockets instead of the posix directly.  The renderer Im using has code to launch the view app by forking if it isnt already running.

Negative 2773 pIm using intrinsics to optimize a program of mine. But now I would like to sum the four elements that are in a m128 vector in order to compare the result to a floating point value.

Negative 2773 pLets say you have a module which containsp  precodemyfile  opentest.txt, r codepre  pAnd the test.txt file is in the same folder. If youll run the module, the file will be opened successfully. Now lets say you import that module from another one which is in another folder. The file wont be searched in the same folder as the module where that code is. So how to make the module search files with relative paths in the same folder first There are various solutions by using codefilecode or codeos.getcwdcode, but Im hoping theres a cleaner way, like same special character in the string you pass to open or file.p

Negative 2773 pI have a series of x and y coordinates that each have a distance attached to them. I would like to create a heat map that displays the average distance for every point within the x and y ranges as a heat map. Since the points are not spaced evenly from each other in a latticelike shape, the method would require some kind of smoothing function that clusters data and calculates the average for each point the vicinity and then representing that average with a color. p  pSo far, using codeggplot2code, I can only find methods like codestatdensity2dcode and codegeomtilecode, which only work for displaying point density and representing evenly spaced points as far as I can tell.p  pIdeally it would follow the same principle as this image  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtbfm4.png altenter image description herep  pin which colors were assigned based on the given points in the vicinity even though the density and placement of the points was not uniform. p  pI do not want to create a heat map in matrix form like this image img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxLwM0.png altenter image description herep  pin which a table is colorcoded. Instead, I would like to create a continuous heat map using nonuniformly distributed x and y coordinates that, in effect, displays the limit in which the data is broken into infinitely many rectangles. This may not be the actual method used by the function, but it provides a general idea as to what Im looking for.p  pHere is some sample datap  precodedatadata.framexc1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,   yc2,4,5,1,3,8,4,8,1,1,6,9,   distancec66,84,93,76,104,29,70,19,60,50,46,36 codepre  pHow can I make a heat map with distance as the color scale that covers the entire range of numbers, like the plot in the first link providedp  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 2773 pIn a Java project I am coding I have ended up using methods that are overridden in constructors. Something likep  precodeclass SuperClass      SuperClass          intialise           protected void initialise          Do some stuff common to all subclasses         methodA         methodB           protected abstract void methodA      protected abstract void methodB   class SubClass1      SubClass          super          protected void methodA  Do something      protected void methodB  Do something     class SubClass2      SubClass          super          protected void methodA  Do something else      protected void methodB  Do something else   codepre  pI now realise, that although in my case it works fine, it is somewhat dangerous since SubClass methods are called on an object that has currently only been constructed as a SuperClass object something that may be overlooked when new classes that extend SuperClass are added in the future. It also wouldnt work in c due to differences in how objects are created.p  pThe only way I can think to get round this is to move the initialise method call down to the concrete classes constructorp  precode   class SuperClass      SuperClass                        protected void initialise          methodA         methodB           protected abstract void methodA      protected abstract void methodB   class SubClass1      SubClass          super         initialise          protected void methodA  Do something      protected void methodB  Do something   ... codepre  pIs this the common way to over come this issue It seems a shame and easy to forget that all further classes that extend SuperClass need to remember to call initialise.p  pI also found myself doing something similar in a more complicated situational that uses a Factory Method in a constructor, which is overridden in subclasses to decide which concrete class to implement.  The only other way I can think to get round this and keep the design pattern as is, is to perhaps construct in a two phase process i.e. construct with the bare minimum, and then call a second method to finish off the job.p

Negative 2773 pIm interested in approaches that avoids code in the code behind. In my opinion, there are some cases where code must be placed in the code behind. For example I have a grid with an undefined count of columns. Columns cant be binded. So the easiest way would be to generate the columns in the code behind.p  pFor this case, I can create a new class which inherits from the grid. This new class has a new binding property and code for the column binding. The code is separated in a custom class which can be used in the XAML. And then, I can easy bind the columns to my newly created property. And the view has no code behind.p  pIs it a good idea How would you solve such or similar problems  Are there other ways to extract the code from the code behindp  pThanks.p

After that I added code from the game amp made the necessary changes for the deprecated code amp for the ARC issues.p  pSince that the game is working but not as expected, I had no animations amp the game was taking the whole CPU power. From the console I saw that everything gets dealloced right after its creation. My old code is not the reason for that because it even happens before any of my scenes gets pushed.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOcOt8.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDITstrong I also repeated again the whole process amp made an ARCenabled version from the Cocos2D template project, but the same there too..

Negative 2773 pAlthough I do somewhat understand the reasons behind it, I find LWJGLs splitting of OpenGL methods and values across numerous classes rather annoying. Since I prefer dealing with functions anyway, Im currently writing a Clojure module that exposes the OpenGL 3.3 core functions and constants in a single namespace.p  pNow the problem is, some OpenGL functions have overloads in LWJGL like for instance codeglBindAttribLocationcode has one for codeByteBuffercode and one for codeCharSequencecode. Now Im saying problem in the broadest sense because Im not sure yet whether this really is one.p  pCan I for instance just writep  precodedefn glBindAttribLocation [program index name]   GL20glBindAttribLocation program index name codepre  pand trust that Clojure will figure out which overload to call, or do I have to do this manually with some typehintuglynessp  pOn the same note, many of LWJGLs functions take codefloatcodes or codeintcodes  but I hear Clojure itself only uses codelongcode and codedoublecode of the primitives that is. Does that mean that everytime I call one of these functions, whatever I have gets converted to an codeIntegercode codeFloatcode and then from there to an codeintcode codefloatcode whenever I call one of these functionsp

Negative 2773 pI am trying to generate a series of auditory spikes from a sampled signal in MATLAB, and the method I have so far implemented is slow.

This gives the height of each spike. Their positions are found by identifying the sample with the maximum value between each pair of zero crossings.p  pI thought of using accumarray... for this, which led me to the idea of generating a matrix where each column represents a pair of zero crossings a spike and each row a sample. Each column is then filled in with ones between the corresponding pair of zero crossings. p  pThe current implementation fills these columns in from the actual data vector, so that we do not have to use accumarray afterwards. p  pCurrent implementationp  precodefunction out  audspikedata      Find the indices of the zero crossings.

Negative 2773 pIm writing a project in which we need to be able to recognize faces using OpenCV. Im training my base on photos, then give test photos to the program with people, which we attended. Recognition works good 8090. But If I give the program a photo with person, which we didnt use in the teaching of our base, the program finds a man in our base with the terrible low distance. At the same time, Apple iPhoto works good with all photos. Can anyone know what algorithm they used to recognize faces  or had my problem Help please.p  pP.S.

Negative 2773 pI am new to ASP.Net and I am confused about the way a GridView control works inside an UpdatePanel. p  pI have read the documentation a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb38645428vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowherea which states By default, any postback control inside an UpdatePanel control causes an asynchronous postback and refreshes the panels content. yet, when I place a GridView and a Button control inside the  element, unless the button has a defined OnClick event to do grid1.DataBind, the grid will NOT refresh its data. Also, I have tried by specifying an AsyncPostBackTrigger on the UpdatePanel for the Button, but again I got the same behaviour. Now, I noticed that the UpdatePanel DOES refresh when I press a Button without OnClick event, however the GridView inside it does not. Please can you shed some light on this Must I always have that call to code behind to explicitly refresh itp  pMy connection string in Web.Configp  precode    ltconnectionStringsgt         ltadd namemyConnectionString              connectionStringData SourceXXXXXInitial CatalogXXXXPersist Security InfoTrueUser IDXXXXXPasswordXXXXX              providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient gt     ltconnectionStringsgt codepre  pMy Default.aspxp  precode lt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeBehindDefault.aspx.cs InheritsEmptyWebApp.Default gt  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt  lthead runatservergt lttitlegtlttitlegt ltheadgt  ltbodygt      ltform idform1 runatservergt          ltdivgt              ltaspScriptManager IDScriptManager runatserver EnablePartialRenderingtrue gt              ltaspUpdatePanel IDUpdatePanel1 runatserver UpdateModeConditionalgt                  ltContentTemplategt                      ltaspGridView IDgrid1 runatserver DataSourceIDSQLDevelopment AutoGenerateColumnsFalsegt                          ltColumnsgt                              ltaspBoundField DataFieldUserID HeaderTextUserID SortExpressionUserID gt                              ltaspBoundField DataFieldDate HeaderTextDate SortExpressionDate gt                          ltColumnsgt                      ltaspGridViewgt                      ltaspSqlDataSource IDSQLDevelopment runatserver                     ConnectionStringlt ConnectionStringsmyConnectionString gt                      SelectCommandSELECT  FROM [TestTableA]gtltaspSqlDataSourcegt                 ltDateTime.Now.ToStringgt ltbr gt                 ltaspButton IDbtnRefresh runatserver TextRefresh without C eventgt                 ltaspButton IDbtnRefresh1 runatserver TextRefresh with C event OnClickbtnRefresh1Clickgt             ltContentTemplategt         ltaspUpdatePanelgt     ltdivgt  ltformgtltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pMy Code behind for btnRefresh1p  precode    protected void btnRefresh1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e              grid1.DataBind      codepre  pTHANK YOUp

Negative 2773 pOne week ago my professor talked about garbage collection and its responsiveness. Basically he said that if you use garbage collection you will always have a very small delay before the code will be executed.p  pNow you can say that the user will not recognize the delay because it is very small.p  pI am working on a game engine for my final bachelor exam and I am currently deciding which scripting language I will choose for my engine.p  hr  pNow I have the following situation.  Lets say you create a game with a first person camera. And lets also say that the gamelogic is written in a language with a garbage collection.p  pstrongWouldnt this imply that the user will encounter more input lag than playing a game where the gamelogic is written in a language without garbage collectionstrongp  pNow input lag is very difficult to predict because there are so many systems that will produce a delay.p  pfor example codeinput gt gamecode executing gt  graphics rendering gt rendering on the screencode.p  pstrongIs it roughly predictable how much delay I will have If I use a language with gc vs a language without gcstrong  codelt1ms, lt10ms lt100mscodep

Negative 2773 pIs there a way a process can mark one of its memory pages as unwriteable for a specific set of threads on Linuxp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm attempting to debug a tricky pointer problem in an OpenMPenhanced C application.  The behavior I observe is that the program segfaults after a random amount of time.  Given a binary, it always segfaults in the same place, but if I change the binary by commenting out code or changing compilation options, the line of code that causes the segfault changes.  The work done in each OpenMP thread is trivial.p  pIf I use gdb to inspect the stack on the segfaulting thread, I observe a single pointer that has been corrupted to point to a nearNULL address.  The pointer variable resides on the stack and points to a heap address.  Id like to have each OpenMP thread mark its stack as unwriteable for all other threads to ensure there are no stack overflow problems or other cases of one thread walking on anothers stack.p  pSetting codeOMPSTACKSIZEcode to a large value say 10M makes the problem go away, but I suspect this is just luck.  As best I can tell, Im using ltlt 100K of stack space for any thread.p  pvalgrinds memcheck reports no problems.p  pAll memory allocations are performed in singlethreaded code in the main thread.  If any race conditions are handled improperly, they would result in incorrect output, but should not result in pointer problems.p  pstrongEDITstrong Eventually, I found my bug.  I was using a codeconstcode instance of a class that has a codemutablecode codeprivatecode member, for some lazy evaluation.  There was a race condition arising from that codemutablecode member.  The solution was to trigger an eager evaluation before entering the parallel block.  As to the title question, I suspect that Damons comment is correct.p

Negative 2773 pAfter a growing tired of the slowness of the emulator and b nearing the end of the development of my first android app, I decided to connect my old and forgotten Toshiba Folio 100 android 2.2 tablet to my Windows 7 development PC, in order to deploy my android app. The PC and tablet see each other, that is, the PC sees the tablet as a disk drive. In the android settings I switched on the developer mode. I read through the many advice threads of this site concerning deploying the app to a real device. To start with, in windows explorer, computer, right click, manage, does not result in recognition of the tablet, except for Toshiba storage USB device.p  pIn Eclipse I went to Run configurations, target tab,tried all the different radio buttons settings, to no avail. The devices view, same story. Eclipse does not see the tablet. I also tried some old Archos 48 mini tablet, again nothing.p  pWhat can I dop  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2773 pI am just trying to get out of my comfort zone of typical NTier architecture of RepositoryServicePresentation and have started looking at DDD with Aggregates and I have to admit Im a little confused and was hoping someone could clarify the following examplep  pIf I had an Entity called News, NewsImage and Customer which were all EF persistable objects like sop  precodepublic class Customer      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual string Name  get set    public class NewsImage      public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual byte[] Data  get set      public virtual News News  get set    public class News       public virtual int Id  get set      public virtual string Name  get set      public virtual ICollectionltNewsImagegt NewsImages  get set      public virtual Customer Customer  get set   codepre  pAs I understand it these could be the objects we would use to persist the domain objects to the database but if we are using aggregates from the domain model we could have something like thisp  precodepublic class NewsAggregate      public int Id  get set      public string Name  get set       public void AddImageToNewsbyte[] imageData                Hide NewsImage or that object and add the byte[] data here       codepre  pMy questions are following and I would appreciate any clarification as I am certain I am misunderstanding the fundamental principles herep  ol liOnly the aggregate objects should be exposed to the presentation layer or any consuming layer.li liHow do I handle convertingpersisting the aggregate objects to the database, I could use mapping which is fine but then how do I know if I am creating an object or updating by whether it is transient if the Id is set or not.  How do I know if new images have been added and which to update or remove  I think the problem I am having is I call create pass a news aggregate to a Repository and create it, I could then get the aggregate back from the domain populated via the entities with EF and then add an image, when I pass the news aggregate back how do I know what has changed in order to createupdate data ol liWhere should the customer go, should it be on the news aggregate object as an AddCustomer method, should there be a CustomerAggregate which has an AddNews method and with both of these options how to persistli olli ol  pMany thanks for any insight, Ive been reading around and looking at sample projects which demonstrate the concept but dont seem to fully explain best ways to achieve this.p

Negative 2773 pSo Ive set off trying to learn web development, and Ive gotten pretty comfortable with basic HTMLcss and Ive made a really nice sample page. However, as of now its just a pretty, markedup text document sitting on my desktop. Id like to include a commenting system where I could write comments to myself as simulated web users. I have a text box and a form to submit the comments, but nothing attached to it. I realize I need to write some kind of script, javascript or php, but then I need to save the comments in some sort of format, like a database, but Im not sure where to start for that. Where should I start in the task of including a commenting system for this basic webpage I have on my desktop book recommendations are welcome as well. p
Negative 2773 pWe are using ASP.NET MVC3, EF 4.3.1, DynamicQuery library We are currently developping a dynamic search engine that could perform search query agains multiple database.p  pSo we have an interface that allows the user to create a query.

Negative 2773 pUsing Delphi 2005, I have created a test app using a TForm to test a SOAP API.

Negative 2773 pAs far as I understand, a mutex is used to lock the critical section so that no other threads can access it when already a thread is using it. So mutex avoids multiple threads trying to use or change the data at a time. But semaphore allows N number of threads to enter the critical section and starts blocking from N1.. Wont the N threads try to change the data at at time when they are inside the critical sectionp

Negative 2773 pI am converting a VB6 app to C with an SQL Server back end. The app includes a very general query editor that allows the user to write any select query and return the results visually in a grid control. Some of the tables have several hundred columns poor design, I know but I have no control over this. A typical use case for an admin user would be to p  precodeselect  from ATableWithManyColumns codepre  pHowever, while they want to be able to view all the data, they are particularly interested in 2 columns and they want these to be displayed as the first 2 columns in the grid instead of 67th and 99th for example so instead they execute the following statementp  precodeselect FirstInterestingField, SecondInterestingField,   from ATableWithManyColumns codepre  pThen they will go and modify the data in the grid. However, when saving this data, it results in a concurrency violation codeDBConcurrencyExceptioncode. This worked fine with the connected RecordSets of VB6 but not so well in C. I have tried a myriad of solutions to no avail.  p  ol lipDoes anyone know how to handle this exception in a generic way Remember, the user can type ANY select statement or join etc. into the query editor  pli lipDoes anyone know how I might manipulate the columns returned such that I delete the 2 columns that appear further on in the list My difficulty here is that if the column name in the database is codeEMailcode so I do codeselect Email,  from Blahcode the 2 pertinent columns returned are codeEMailcode and ADO.NET or C aliases the second codeEMailcode column from the codecode portion of the query as codeEMail1code so I am not able to detect the second column as a duplicate and remove itpli lipDoes anyone have an alternate solution I have not thought ofpli ol  pThank you very muchp

Negative 2773 pI am developing a WP8 application with a Native DirectXD3D component and a CXAML component.p  pThe Native component draws to a  UI element and the CXAML component has the controls of the app and other things surrounding it. Usually, I send information from the CXAML component down to the Native component. But there are certain times when I would like to trigger events in the CXAML component based on when processing is done in the Native component. In one planned feature, I envision a CXAML progress bar that is kept up to date by events triggered in the Native component.p  pUnfortunately, despite some mediocre attempts to get information passed from the Native component to the CXAML one, I havent made much progress and I feel dead in the water.p  pI would greatly appreciate any guidance on this. Thanks for reading.p

Negative 2773 pSo we use the same controllers to serve both mobile and desktop views of our site. We also use action caching heavily to cache the html for a page in memcache.

That way the mobile and and desktop pages will be saved under a different namespace so there are no conflicts in memcache. p  pWe could do this per cachesaction method by creating a custom cachepath using the controller variable for ismobile, but wed prefer to do it globally somehow. Any suggestions I imagine this would require monkeypatching ActionControllerCaching but I cant figure out where it generates the views prefix.p

These files would be placed under a highperformance cdn, geographically distributed and all that. When the user goes top  pwww.mysite.comprods00123p  pthe server or even the client would load a template file for the layout, and then fill it with the data it reads from something like cdn.mysite.comprods00123.jsonp  pSo I basically dont need to do queries in this case  I jump straight to the file named after the product id. I guess it should be very fast, and yet I would delegate the scalability  caching  geographic distribution to an external strong partner cdn like akamai, amazon etc. instead of building my own expensive and hard to maintain distributed db serverp  pI look forward to your suggestions  feedback...especially if it comes to real world experience p  pThanksp

Negative 2773 pI have a codedivcode that scrolls just fine on a desktop browser, but on a mobile device with a touchscreen, scrolling isnt working.p  pHere is a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjXSUE relnofollowstripped down jsFiddlea with bits of actual code. The scrolling will work fine for you in your mobile browser, but trust me when I say that exact same code is not scrolling when on a touchscreen device.p  pThe actual device Im using is an LG Optimus Elite Android device.p  pYou may see that Im using the slimScroll library, but rest assured that is not the issue, as I have it implemented elsewhere in my code, successfully even on a touchscreen.p  pBesides, Ive tried removing slimScroll and just using native scrolling, with the same negative result.p  pIts like the touchscreen device isnt registering my touch to scroll the div.p  pEDIT Looks like scrolling also works fine on an iPhone same screen size as the LG Optimus Elite. So the problem perhaps lies with Android...p
Negative 2773 pSo when I open my document, this is what I seep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKG28F.png altenter image description herep  pHere are the first and the first part of the second page the rest of it is empty of my document. Except for the content in the green rectangle which is managed by box layout, they are 100 equal.p  pAfter all visible elements magenta stuff, the first JTextArea bigger than the others doesnt matter regarding to the problem, they both have a Box.Filler added to them, to push all the content to the top of the page.p  pSo when I open the document item 38. should be as high as all others, but for some reason it isnt.p  pI didt call the repaint and validate on both JScrollPane and its viewport that conatins both pages right after opening of a document.p  pAlso, when I add or remove another element anywhere in the document, number 38 comes to its senses and resizes to its proper height. I did call the sam repaints and validates when that happens as I have at the opening of the document.p  pchageShape method called on the filler with same sizes it had does the trick, but it seems to be a dirty solution...p  pBut why doesnt it do that right awayp  pEDIT After some more testing, I have discovered that the filler has been a bad bad boy here. But its hard for me to understand why the one on the first page always updates itself properly even with fewer elements on the page, but the one on second page refuses to, even though there are no differences in how the two pages were coded two instances of the same object and that repaint and validate is called from a container superior to both.p

The box works as followsp  ol liThere is one maven repository which is hosted through Apache Server as a URL for developers to useli liAll Jenkins jobs including release jobs run mvn install so that artifacts are kept in this one repository.li ol  pI would like to get rid of the Apache server and run Nexus on this same box to manage and host repositories, however I have the following questionsideasp  pWith Nexus and Jenkins on the same box, will it mean that I will have to manage two repositories, one where maven installs an artifact to a local repository, and one where maven deploys an artifact to nexus Would it be possible to have Nexus manage the mvn install repository also How can I make sure we dont run out of disk space on the server very very quickly all the timep  pThanksp  pAdded as response to comments Thank you both, I am thinking I will just set the Jenkins jobs and release plugin goals to mvn package deploydeploy in order to skip the install phase, that way, artifacts go directly from the target directory to Nexus. However I guess the Jenkins job will require a local repository from which to use depedencies which will get copied from Nexus to the maven local repository during the build, I am not sure if this can be avoided though.p

Negative 2773 pIMO the bootstrap carousel out of the box is limited and not designed for enterprise use.  Does anyone know of a resource out there with customization of the component to work similar to how Hulu, netflix and itunes have implemented carousels on their sitesp  pMore specifically, i need the carousel to not overflow onto multiple rows and instead stay on one line and reveal only the amount of items that the space provides. The new grid system in BS3 works great for this sans carousel, however as soon as you apply the carousel functionality it behaves likes the old bootstrap and doesnt work well at the smaller breakpoints. p  psee netflix.com or hulu.com or take a look at the itunes desktop app for examples of desired implementation. p

I therefore launch a subprocess that sets the serial port to RAW mode using stty, and forward data using cat. This trick works perfectly on the command line. If I then redirect stdout to a Java program, data flows correctly to its input stream.p  pThe problem here is that using this code to get data to a subprocess not the stdin of the Java programm, you guessed it, Im loosing characters. I expect lines of 10 numbers of 3 digits, separated by commas, and I get between 4 and 6 numbers, sometimes followed by a comma.p  pI think theres a buffering issue, my Java application might not be able to empty the very limited serial port buffer.p  pIs there something I could do Java wise, or should I turn to the Linux kernel geeks for some OS tricks herep  pThanks,p  pMathieup

Negative 2773 pI have a data in the text file and I want to create an undirected weighted graph as I read it from the file. Data consists of tweets.

Negative 2773 pOk, so I was recently put in charge of some really bad proceduralstyle code, and I need to write the rest of the site using PHP and being as object oriented as possible.p  pI have also decided that MVC would be the most logical ptatern to use, but I cannot find any true microrelated reading material or tutorials anywhere. The micro mvc will just have to take some input from a query string or whatever, and redirect the user to the views like a regular mvc, however I will not need all of that other functionality that is present in all the other frameworks. I also need to be able to fully customize it myself, which is why I am stuck. I simply just cant get to the writing stages. I dont know where to begin, or what to write.p  pA flow of how the app would work with my mvc code should be as follows Click on link from app  redirected to a serve.php or other, to serve up the file required  Send user to a view with a few inputs and outputs tofrom the database.p  pI have problems writing the problem properly into words, its just that Im too much of an idiot to figure it out for myself, I guess.p  pDoes anyone have any quickanddirty tips so I can get this prototype up and runningp

Negative 2773 pIm sectioning off pieces of a solutions into individual solutions and integrating them into an Atlassian Bamboo builddeploy environment. I have a site, a WCF with Windows Workflow Foundation, and a library containing all the classes that are shared.  All is written in C btw.p  pOne thing inside the library is a class that interfaces with a Magento php based SOAP interface. Basically it just provides me with a handler for all of the SOAP Exceptions that Magento spits back to me. It uses SOAP Exceptions as valid, but bad results... Example Product X does not exist. etc.p  pIt could be ANY SOAP interface though. MEAT AND POTATOSp  pI have a development and production Magento machine, and I have two pretty much identical soap interfaces.. www.mysite.comsoapetc and dev.mysite.comsoapetc exposed by these two machines.  Each is loaded as a web reference in the library, and for a long time I was using a compile time if DEBUG constant to switch between two different Using statements. Whether I picked debug or release, it would choose the correct reference. Here is the codep  precodeif DEBUG     using NKI.Library.MagentoDev else     using NKI.Library.MagentoProd endif codepre  pNow, I need to be able to specify this pick later, after the library has been compiled into a DLL..  btw, dont get on my case about hard coding a url into the dll  p

Negative 2773 pI was recently had an nginx  phpfpm server that was serving images like sop  precodeheaderContentType imagepng echo filegetcontentsexampleimage.png exit codepre  pWhat I am came to realize, whether the image was cached or not, there was a huge peformance hit on the server. CPU utilization was extremely high, 100 with a minimal amount of connections. So I started to offload the images to a CDN and there was an immediate performance improvement but in some cases I still do require the image to be served through a server, which has brought me to the idea of imagemedia server.p  pMy question is, is there a specific type of server that I should be using One that can communicate with a database to find the images location and serve it File system type Or am I better off keeping just firing up another nginx  phpfpm instance and create a cdn like structure implementation wherep  precodemedia.example.com  codepre  ppoints only to that server, thus there is no performance impact on the web serverp

Negative 2773 pSo I am running into a race condition and I have a few solutions on how to fix the issue. I am new to threading so obviously, my opinion and research is limited.  I have a large amount of asynchronization calls that can happen if a user receives certain messages from server.  Thus, my design is poor due to the dependent nature of my objects. p  pLets say I have a function called p  precodeadduserNSString s does some asynchronize activity  MessageuserNSString s   Does some more asychronize activity  codepre  pif a user were to recieve a message telling it to addUser Ryan. he would than create a thread and proceed with looking up Ryan and storing him. However, if the user has the application in suspended mode, and in the buffered of messages waiting to be recieved there is a addUser request and a MessageUser request, a race condition occures because it takes longer to complete Adduser than it does to complete MessageUser.  Thus, If messageUser is called , and in our example Ryan has not been fully added, it throws an error. p  pWhat would be a possible solution to this issue.  I looked into locks and semaphores, and what I am trying to do is, when MessageUser recieves a call, check to make sure there is no thread currently proccessing addUser. If there is none, proceed. Else wait, than proceed after it has finished. p

Negative 2773 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comftlabsfastclick relnofollowfastclicka with my bootstrap 3 responsive web site to speed up the responsive time on mobile devices. Generally this works fine with no issues. However after much testing I have found this breaks the bootstrap radio buttons on an iphone.p  pThe buttons do work initially but if you change the selected option only the first selected options is passed when the form is submitted. Removing fastclick stops this behavior.  Or more to the point on my minimal testing page adding fastclick will make the behavior occur.

I do not want to re engineer the entire site on the hope that adding in jqmobile will help. Nor do we have the time.p  pHow can I solve this. I surprised that I cannot find any other data on using fastclick with bootstrap radio buttons.

When there are more than one datasource is involved, we see transaction errors. By turning on trace level logging for org.jboss.jca, we see warnings such as cannot list another datasource form current one and the jdbc driver failed.p  pThe other problem we saw is that the Transactional requires a presence of EntityManager.

Negative 2773 pI currently have two large numpy arrays of equivalent lengths. The first array is filled with values in sets of 5 that will either be a set of 5 float values or 5 0s as suchp  precode    [ [.03, 5, .1, 0.23, 5], [.1, .6, .8, 4.3], [0,0,0,0,0] ... ]  codepre  pThe 2nd array is filled with values in the same fashion. I need to combine the two arrays so that at any position where arraytwo has a non zero value set, the corresponding position in arrayone needs to be set to that value. If arrayone already has a value then it should stay the same. That is kind of a mouthful so here is an example of what I am trying to explain should happen.p  precode    Array one  [ [.03, 5, .1, 0.23, 5], [0,0,0,0,0], [.1, .6, .8, 4.3, .2], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0] ... ]      Array two [ [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0], [.1, .6, .8, 4.3], [0,0,0,0,0],      [32 ,2 , 4.6 , 3.4 , 0.2] ... ] codepre  pThe resulting array should be p  precode    [ [.03, 5, .1, 0.23, 5], [0,0,0,0,0], [.1, .6, .8, 4.3, .2], [0,0,0,0,0],         [32 ,2 , 4.6 , 3.4 , 0.2] ...     ] codepre  pessentially the new array gets the value from arraytwo at position 5. This cant be accomplished with a sum because that would make position three twice what it should be.p

In the 3D case, I calculated the codedestXcode, codedestYcode and codedestZcode indices according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10903149howdoicomputethelinearindexofa3dcoordinateandviceversaTHISa explanation. The second thing that I changed is the ifcondition for the second batch loading codeifdestZ lt Wcode to use codedestZcode instead of codedestYcode.p  pMy question now is what the reason for the incorrect values inside layer 4 and 5 of the output is. I guess Im missing some understanding on how big the codeTILEWIDTHcode MUST be in order to work properly.

Negative 2773 pI have an operation A that use an async NSURLConnection to retrieve a list of IDs from a web service. When the response is received, the operation loop over these IDs and create an operation B for each ID and add them to the queue. p  pWhen I started testing with a maxConcurrentOperationCount to 1, I could not execute more than the A operation. So it seems that B operations added to the queue are still waiting for A completion.p  pThe executing and finished properties are updated correctly and the KVO notification on isFinished is working as expected, but the queue still contains 2 operations, the A operation is never removed.p  pI tried to changed the code which was scheduling the connection in the NSRunLoop with a port, by a performSelectorOnMainThread selectorstart, and it solved this problem, but It creates another one. When operations B are executed, depending on the server response they can start other nonconcurrent operations C by calling their start method and not by adding them to the queue, and in this case I need that B does not finish until C has finished this is why Im using start and not adding C to the queue, and I do not want to execute C on the main thread which is what is happening when I use performSelectorOnMainThread.p  pIf anybody can help me to fix my problem with the runloop code, I tried to look at AFNetworking and other libraries but I dont see what Im doing wrong.        p  precode voidsend      serverConnection  [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest urlRequest delegate self startImmediately NO]     port  [NSPort port]     runLoop  [NSRunLoop currentRunLoop]     [runLoop addPort port forMode NSDefaultRunLoopMode]     [serverConnection scheduleInRunLoop runLoop forMode NSDefaultRunLoopMode]     [serverConnection start]     [runLoop run]     voidconnectionNSURLConnection theConnection didFailWithErrorNSError theError      [runLoop removePort port forMode NSRunLoopCommonModes]   code handling error     voidconnectionDidFinishLoadingNSURLConnection theConnection      [runLoop removePort port forMode NSRunLoopCommonModes]   code processing response   If this is executed on main thread, nonconcurrent operations created and started from the response processing code,    will be executed on main thread, instead of using the thread that was dedicated to this operation.   codepre

Negative 2773 pI have a dead simple stored procedure which only does an codeINSERTcode to a table.p  pThe stored procedure takes several parameters its called from C code and does a simple insert.p  pEverything works fine with the insert  however, in some cases, there might be a PK violation, in which case I check the error code, and if there was a PK violation  then make an codeUPDATEcode.p  pAfter inserting the codeUPDATEcode, the stored procedure just hangs.

Even when the stored procedure hangs for a long time, after I comment out the codeUPDATEcode and update the stored procedure so that it only has the codeINSERTcode all of the rows get inserted. Its buffering them up somewhere, I guess.p  pI tried moving the codeUPDATEcode command to a different stored procedure and calling it codeEXEC updateSproccode from the original stored procedure. This seemed to have solved the problem at first glance, however, upon close inspection I could see that the update was still not working. I guess the only thing that happened is that the codeupdateSproccode was hanging instead of the original one  letting the C code continue and inserting new values.p  pI tried updating and deleting from other tables from withing the original stored procedure and there was no problem.p  pIts as if this table is not allowing codeUPDATE,DELETEcode.p  pEverything is running as sap  pThe table is not so large, about a million rows.p  pThe fragmentation is OK.

In those documents it a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebGuideEventsCreatingandtriggeringeventsCreatingevents relnofollowsays thata these custom events are not supported by IE.p  pHowever, I have used jquery plugins before which uses custom events and works on IE.p  pMy questions are p  ol liAre custom events supported by IEli liHow can I find compatibility across browsersli liWhat is the correct way to use custom eventsli liAre there any jQuery Plugins which caters for custom events li liAre there any NEGATIVE impacts of using custom eventsli ol  pstrongemQuestion 1, 2 amp 3 are the main concern to ask this question.emstrongp

I have to copy the app to the application folder easy from a cd not dvd but a 700 mb cd keep that in mind and 300 to 500 mb zip file, containing webpages and resources, in the app folder AppName.app and unarchive it there in a codewwwcode folder.p  pI tried doing this with a codepackage installercode and a codeshell scriptcode unfortunately the script runs in a codesandboxcode and I cant access the content form the cd.p  pI cant put the zip files in the install package because there is a windows and a linux installer that uses them too. So its a shared resource.p  pIve tried different approaches to resolve this issue, none seemed to work.The only solution that is in my head right now is to make another app in codeobjective ccode that will run from the cd witch will copy the real app and the zip file to the applications folder. p  pI must have an friendly executable installer for the app and that is my only desperate choice at the moment. Is there any other way to do thisp

However, I have been getting the following error for the past 4 daysbr codeThe application was unable to start correctly 0xc000007b. Click OK to close the application.codep  pThe error only happens when running applications that I wrote myself, and that I compiled using the MinGWgfortran combo. When compiling using Visual Studio and iFort, I have no problem running the applications. The error seems retroactive applications that were compiled using gfortran a long time ago and ran perfectly until now also break, even though I didnt recompile them. This leads me to think that it is a dynamic library problem. Online searches show that it probably is a compatibility problem between a 64bit dll and a 32bit applicationp  pI am using Windows 7.

Indeed, it seems that libquadmath0.dll is a 64bit DLL in the middle of a 32bit program. When opening said .dll with Dependency Walker, I can see that all the modules in this library are x86 except the library itself which is x64 CPU column of DW. I am not exactly sure how this is possible  how to fix it. The library is found in the PythonAnaconda folder I installed Python and Anaconda a few weeks ago, the problem did NOT appear at that time.p  pIf anybody has an idea of how to get my environment to work again without reinstalling Windows, I would greatly appreciate it Thanksp

Negative 2773 pI have very little experience with programming, but have been requested to hide a row of a table on a customer site using only javascript. I know how to do this with both HTML or CSS, but have been told I cannot access those elements in the 3rd party platform we are using and must create a script for it.p  pI have the html entered at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzcho5zs5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netzcho5zs5a and could use any help to get the entire second row to be hidden.

Negative 2773 pToday i have been busy bringing an old project back to live, i converted into a m2e project 1 maven root project with multiple modules.

Negative 2773 pIm creating an app which tracks users location and draws a polyline when onLocationChangeLocation location is called. Polyline color depends on accelerometer. I know how to use polyline but PolyLineOptions object can be only onecolor.

Can someone help me, give some example links Please notice that each polyline or bitmap line should be added dynamically when user moves.

Negative 2773 pIn our Angular JS application, we have login with Facebook and share to Facebook functionality. For login with facebook, we have an app Id. We go through the setup routine and FB.init is called with this App ID.  When it comes to share, we want to share to facebook using a different APP ID. So my question is how to handle this scenario as I already did FB.init once with login APP IDp  p1 I checked Facebook documentation and couldnt find if init accepts two App IDs in the first place. p  p2 Other idea is, can I create one more object for Facebook SDK that will be named some thing else instead of FB, so that I can call init on this new object  Thanks in advancep

Negative 2773 pBefore I updated Rails, the default Time format the API was returning was codeyyyyMMddTHHmmssZcode. Now it returns codeyyyyMMddTHHmmsssssZcode.

How can I change this PROJECT default format that codeTimeDateTimecodes codetoscode method returnsp  pEditp  pI should probably mention I started using the codeactivemodelserializercode gem. Not sure if that makes a difference. My guess is this change happened after the update from Rails 4.0.x to 4.1.x. Also I want to change this format for the project. This format changed between Rails versions. codeactivemodelserializercode uses codetoscode, so it makes more sense to override how to project sets this. I dont know where that is.p

Negative 2773 pIve read a lot about how the standard does not allow temporaries to be passed by nonconst reference, but I could find anything convincing on why is that. p  pThe usual argument I encounter is that it is unsafe because the lifetime of the value is unknown. But in reality it is not, it is bound to the function, whose parameter it is, and will remain alive until that function returns, so it is safe to use it inside that function, pass it to another function inside it and another... Basically as long as it is all synchronous execution, it should be safe, since the object will remain there until the first function receiving it returns.p  pWhat is the fundamental difference between the two approachesp  precodedoSomethingcreateSomething       something s  createSomething     doSomethings  codepre  paside from the second one unnecessarily polluting the scope with an identifier for an object you will only use once.p  pThe way I see it, the fact that it is a temporary only limits the potential to do damage, since it will no longer be used after that function call.p  pCan someone provide a snipped with what kind of bad things may happen in practice by passing a temporary by referencep  pAlso, my question is strictly prec11, so rvalue references are outside its scope.p  pEDIT From the linked question, sbis answerp  precode this doesnt compile  ggetx  g would modify an object without anyone being able to observe codepre  pBut that implies that the only reason one would ever pass something by reference is to be able to observe changes made in that function after it has returned. Now, OBVIOSLY, if you use a temporary it goes without saying this is not part of your intent, nor is the reason just mentioned the only reason one would pass by reference. Which is why the scope of that question is not the same as the one labeled duplicate. You are just as likely to pass by reference to avoid a costly copy and your design can involve use of that object which is entirely encapsulated within that function and functions called within.p  pThat other question focuses on one use of pass by reference and doesnt explain what could go wrong, nor does it take into consideration the very fact that using a temporary negates that one concern the answers address. It basically answers because it would modify an object without anyone being able to observe, which is rightfully presented as pointless, but which is CLEARLY not the intent when you use a temporary in the first place. p  pTo put it in other words, the answer says You cant do it, because you cant observe the changes when you dont want to observe the changes... DOH How can the limitation be the inability to do something you clearly dont want to dop

Negative 2773 pI have not been able to find this around the web or in the docs, though that may be my due to my own incompetence. I plot functions in Octave by putting the xs in an x vector and the ys in an fx vector and then calling codeplotx,fxcode. However, since the function has huge vertical jumps it creates unwanted vertical lines. I can do codeplotx,fx,.code, but that makes the line very thick. How can I plot a discontinuous function with a thin line p

Im having trouble understanding the relationship between courseName, name which is in both GradeBook and GradeBookTest, and setCourseName. Ive tried rereading sections in my book which is not the best, watching youtube videos, etc but Im just not following here. I feel like I am oh so close to understanding it, toop  pSo to start off, Does the String name in GradeBookTest have any relationship with the String name in the constructor of GradeBook Are they the same objectsp  pAlso, why does String name have to be in parentheses in the setCourseName method It is already initialized in the constructor, and so the method setCourseName should be able to pull in String name without it there, rightp  pSo it seems like the order of operations arep  ol liClass GradeBookTest runs and initializes String name.li liIt assigns what the user inputs from the first question into name. name is now a placeholder for whatever the user input was.li liWhat happens with name now that is in GradeBook and in the parentheses of the constructorli liIt then seems that the object setCourseName is being set as whatever is in name from the GradeBookTest class user inputli lipIm just not sure what is happening from the constructor through the next method setCourseName, in terms of the String name being passed around.

Negative 2773 pUsing either codeVARCHAR256code or codeTEXTcode to store a 256character string will require 256 bytes for the string, and 2 bytes of overhead.

Negative 2773 pIm switching over to Sublime Text 2 from my longtime IDE jEdit because it doesnt support TFS.  And Im on Windows, BTW.p  ol lipA feature I miss is Quick Copy.  It is like a temporary clipboard where any text you select gets put in it automatically no need to CtrlC.  Then, Altclicking anywhere else will insert i.e. paste that text into the file somewhere else.pli lipAlso, a related technique is to put the cursor where you want some text, then go find it and drag over it while holding the Alt key and it will be duplicated and put back where you left your cursor, and youll be whisked back to your prior location.  Love this feature use it so often when I go off to find a structure name, file path, or even big old chunk of code that I want to use.pli lipAnd again, a different nuance to this is an areablock duplication... you put your cursor at the start of a block of text and then AltShftClick at the end of the block and everything in between is duplicated.  So much faster than Highlight, CtrlC, CtrlV, CtrlV.pli ol  pThese are just small issues, but it really saves keystrokes on something that we coders do hundreds maybe even thousands of times a day.p  pDoes Sublime Text 2 have anything like any of these featuresp  pThanks for any helpp

So BIGNUMBER 1234567812345678 should have SMALLNUMBER 123456 next to it. If I am querying I could do this with a JOIN and a LIKE SMALLNUMBER but I am not sure how to do that here to make the data end up like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com25Da0.jpg altSimple SQL Merge Correctp  pIt doesnt have to be fancy comparing the smallnumber to the bignumber. When I BULK insert data into TABLE1 and TABLE2 they are in the same order so simply copying the data into TABLE3 without caring if SMALL is the start of BIG is fine with me. p  pThere is no relationship at all in these tables. This is the simplest form I can think of. Basically two flat tables that need to be merged side by side. There is no logic to implement... start at row 1 and go to the end on BIGNUMBER. Start at row 1 again and go to the end on SMALLNUMBER. All that matters is if BIGBUMBER has 50 rows and SMALLNUMBER has 50 rows, in the end, there is still only 50 rows.p  pWhen I was using the query above I was going off of a page I was reading on MERGE. Now that I look over this I dont see MERGE anywhere... so maybe I just need to understand how to use MERGE.p

Because codeHtmlInputTextcode is a subClass of codeUIInputcode. And when we try to bind object of codeParentcode class where codeChildcode class is expected, this error is thrown. This is similar to when we try to cast a Parent Object to Child referencep  pNow if this is the case, then my question is how same code works with Mojjara JSF implementation.

Negative 2773 pNow that Im looking to use Embercli for my frontend, Id need to use OpenID Connect for authentication and authorisation. p  pHas anyone done anything like this before. I couldnt find any examples so far. I came across a hrefhttpembersimpleauth.com relnofollowemberclisimpleautha, a hrefhttpsgithub.comsimplabsemberclisimpleauthoauth2 relnofollowemberclisimpleauthoauth2a, a hrefhttpsgithub.comjpadillaemberclisimpleauthtoken relnofollowemberclisimpleauthtokena.p  pIm guessing I should be using emberclisimpletoken Has anyone tried this if so could you point me to any examplesreading resourcesp  pUpdate 11 Jul 15  Ive been looking into a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.compackagetorii relnofollowtoriia in particular a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.compackageemberclitoriiazureprovider relnofollowemberclitoriiazureprovidera. I could get Authorization code fine, but no IdToken I guess its because it isnt asking Azure AD for IdToken , looks like I do need to look at writing a new torii provider. As per the Torii documentation, p  pemTorii will lookup providers in the Ember application container, so if you name them conventionally put them in the apptoriiproviders directory they will be available automatically when using embercli or ember app kit.emp  pDoes it mean, in my embercli project, I need to create toriiproviders folder and create the new provider lets say toriiazureopenidconnect.jsp
Negative 2773 pI am writing a vb.netWPF program that will have a datagrid. Multiple people will be using this program at the same time so I need to try to keep everyones datagrid refreshed and matching. I am not sure how to go about doing this. I thought I would set a background worker to every so often just refresh the datatable and refill the datagrid. I am not sure if this is the best strategy so am looking to SO for suggestions. One of the problems I have with this method is that when the datagrid is refilled it loses any sorting that the user may have applied.p

Then use a queue to enqueue the root node, see if matches the desired value and if it does not, push the child elements and dequeue the root. p  pI am not really sure where to begin with this in JavaScript AngularJS, as there are no structs or pointers. When performing an http.get in AngularJS, I would like to store the data in a BST and search for items with BFS. p  pCan anyone suggest a starting place Would using pure JavaScript to create a custom data structure be preferablep  pstrongEditstrong changed node to struct edited question header AngularJS to JavaScript, as I now understand underlying data structures would be built in the base language and not the framework. p

Negative 2773 pI am wrapping two java programs as services using yajsw yet another java service wrapper in order to have them run indefinitely on separate servers. I got one of them to work exactly as I expected the service is installed on a server, behaves exactly as it does when run from cmd and restarts anytime it or the server goes down. However, when I do this with the second java project it does not work. It gets installed as a service and will run, but when it tries to run a powershell script something the first project does not do from within java, using ProcessBuilder, it starts  and powershell.exe shows up in task manager, but never closes or produces any of the expected side effects. Both things that work seamlessly when I run the .jar from the command line. Is there something different about the environments that servicesprocesses run in that would explain this p  pUpdate Within the script I have the following line outlook  newobject com outlook.applicationp  pThe problem is that outlook is null after this and the script then fails to parse any emails resulting in no output. What about wrapping the java program as a service would mess up the creation of an outlook application objectp

Negative 2773 pThrough an codeSSIScode package, I need to export data from a codemySqlcode database. So I created a User Data Source with both versions of the codemysql odbc 5.3 drivercode ANSI amp Unicode, and both connect successfully through the codeODBC Data Source Administratorcode.p  pSo in VS2008 SSIS, I select codeOdbc Data Providercode and then select the mysql user DSN that I created and tested. Once selected, when I click Test Connection, I get error emTest connection failed because of an error in initializing provider. ERROR [IM002] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified.em I get the same error with both user DSNs.p  pWhat can the problem be We have codeWindows Server Enterprise SP2code and I dont have administrator access, which is why I cant create a System DSN.p  pI checked in the Registry Editor and both datasources are under codeODBC.INIcode and theyre configured correctly. I also read to change from codelocalhostcode to code127.0.0.1code but I still get the same error.p  pFinally, I created a codeFile DSNcode which also connects successfully, but Im not sure how to configure SSIS to look at that data source.p  pI also installed codeMySql ConnectorODBC 5.1.13code thinking it could be the driver, but I receive the same error.p  pI also noticed that when I create a data source from the ODBC data source administrator, I can see all mysql drivers, plus the older version that I installed today. On the other hand, when I create a machine data source from the VS2008 SSIS interface, I dont see any of the mysql drivers. In other words, I cannot create a mysql data source from within VS2008.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 2773 pI am new to F and looking for recommendations for tools to accomplish a project that consists of three applications.p  pApplication 1 is a data processing service. It is supposed to receive data to be processed from another application over local network. The application keeps track of processing queue, individual jobs in the queue and logs information to sqlite database.p  pApplication 2 is a webUI where users construct data to be sent over to Application 1. The webUI should receive updates to queue and jobs in realtime. Application 2 should also be able to request specific information from Application 1, such as information regarding one of the jobs.p  pApplication 3 is a mobile application, much simplified version of Application 2. Most likely usable only when phonetablet has vpn connection to the network where Application 1 is located.p  pId like to keep things simple and easy to use and develop. From what I have researched, WebSharper might be just what I am looking for. Am I right in my assumption I am not quite sure if WebSharper can be used to build Application 1.p  pAre there other F tools out there that are better fit for any of the applications I have describedp  pThank you in advance for any and all advice. p

Negative 2773 pI am working on an ASP.NET MVC 5 website that has a public marketing website that contains somewhat static pages with information about the company, legal, social, contact us, etc. that a nonlogged in user can access. Then, once logged in, there is a back end of the website that registered users have access to features.p  pOriginally I had all the public marketing pages going to a hrefhttpwww.mywebsite.comMarketingAbout relnofollowhttpwww.mywebsite.comMarketingAbouta, a hrefhttpwww.mywebsite.comMarketingSocial relnofollowhttpwww.mywebsite.comMarketingSociala, etc.p  pHowever, the business wants all the marketing pages, to be accessible a single directory down from the root website, so the links above would be accessible with a hrefhttpwww.mywebsite.comAbout relnofollowhttpwww.mywebsite.comAbouta, a hrefhttpwww.mywebsite.comSocial relnofollowhttpwww.mywebsite.comSociala, etc.p  pI know I can use the below approach to get it to work by registering individual routes for each marketing page like sop  precode        routes.MapRoute             ShortAbout,             About,             new  controller  Marketing, action  About                    routes.MapRoute             ShortSocial,             Social,             new  controller  Marketing, action  Social           codepre  pHowever, since there are about 15 marketing pages, this seems inefficient and it seems like there must be a better way to do this.p  pI also tried a generic routing approach outlined here a hrefhttpwww.wduffy.co.ukblogaspnetmvcrooturlswithgenericrouting relnofollowhttpwww.wduffy.co.ukblogaspnetmvcrooturlswithgenericroutingap  pbut the problem with that approach was I had a marketing page, with the same name as a controller and it ended up forwarding the user to the marketing subdirectory. For example, I had a Controller called MachineController, and in the MarketingController I had an actionpage called Machine, so it was forwarding the user to MarketingMachine using the approach in the above link.p  pAny other ideas Thanks in advance.p

Project  2.1.2.46 and we dont have to change the build definition every release.p  pWhat I basically want to achieve, is that the outcome of my build script below is used as build number format. p  precode Enable Verbose option [CmdletBinding]  Disable parameter  Convenience option so you can debug this script or disable it in   your build definition without having to remove it from  the Postbuild script path build process parameter. param[switch]Disable if PSBoundParameters.ContainsKeyDisable      WriteVerbose Script disabled no actions will be taken on the files.

So, that shows me that my script is working. However, When the build is finished, the build number changed back to its default value, which was provided in the build definition. p  pAny help will be appreciatedp

Negative 2773 pBeen working in Java with images from the web encoded as base64 strings. I have only seen imagepng format in img src tags i.e. codedataimagepngbase64,eNc0d3dStng...code I have not seen imagegif or imagejpg. I have looked on SO and read a little on base 64 encoding.p  pFurthermore, I strip off the codedataimagepngbase64code part in Java Android when doing  codeBase64.decodesrc, Base64.DEFAULTcode so it looks like there is no need for the png in that situation.
