Positive 348 pIve made a method to play sounds in mp3 format max file size 145kb. When an event happens in the game I just send the file to this method. It creates a new mediaplayer instance whenever it is called, then releases that instance on completion.  My problem is that with both the emulator and my phone, when I play 2 sounds near simultaneously, the sounds either skip like a scratched CD, or one sound doesnt play at all, or sometimes it actually works.p  pIs a thread getting overloaded or something I have a Samsung galaxy s3. Should I use soundpool instead Ive heard it has its own problemsp  precodepublic class MediaSimultaneous   private MediaPlayer[] mediaPlayerArray  new MediaPlayer[10] private AudioManager mAudioManager int playerNum  1  Array index of the player instance.  public void playSoundContext context, int audioId      if mAudioManager  null          mAudioManager  AudioManager context.getSystemServiceContext.AUDIOSERVICE              playerNum  1         mediaPlayerArray[playerNum]  MediaPlayer.createcontext, audioId          mediaPlayerArray[playerNum].setOnPreparedListenernew MediaPlayer.OnPreparedListener               Override             public void onPreparedMediaPlayer mp                  mp.start                 mp.setOnCompletionListenernew MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener                       Override                     public void onCompletionMediaPlayer mp                           mp.release                         mediaPlayerArray[playerNum]  null                         playerNum  1                          if playerNum lt 0                              playerNum  0                                                                                         codepre
Positive 348 pIm a novice so this may seem like a rather basic problem. p  pA html page has 4 html embedded audio players which looked as styled and worked fine.  I then added a slide player called Fancy Box. The CSS and JS files are linked to separate folders than the CSS and JS files of the audio player.p  pThe audio players continue to work fine however, the style attributes no longer show up, instead the browsers audio player shows. Fancy Box works fine.p  pIs there a CSS or JS conflict of some sort  p  pAny advice is much appreciated in solving my dilemma.

It stores the pressure point of audio depending on sample Rate in an array.ex. if sampleRate is 44100 , then during encoding AudioFormat method in java will check for 44100 subsequent pressure points for each second .

Positive 348 pOn a Synology drive, Im trying to transcode audio in an .MKV file from DTS to AAC using the native ffmpeg encoder. But without any error message at least I dont recognize any here, the audio stream is just missing in the output files. I tried it on several different files, all with the same result, leading to the conclusion that either Im unable to see the error or somethings wrong with FFMPEG.

Positive 348 pI host a site on a Linux server that I built with php where I am able to upload audio files in one section and video files to another. Each section uses php to upload a single audio file and a single video file. Each upload is assigned a unique filename so they can be viewed separately on an individual page where the uploader can post comments about their audio or video. I want to be able to allow musicians and performers in the local area display their work.  The site works, but large video files do not upload and my audio player only plays a few formats, and I like to convert them all to mp3s.  I installed ffmpeg on my linux server to help me with this and am able to connect to it with my terminal.  My question is how do I get ffmpeg to interface with my uploaded php files. For example, as the user uploads an audio file, can I have ffmpeg convert it while its uploading, or do I need to set up a temporary folder for uploads, store it there, then have ffmpeg compress the file, convert it to a specific format and save it in another folder I would prefer to have it compress and change the format while its uploading so as not to use server space, but if this is not the way ffmpeg works, then I dont have a choice.  Any help would be appreciated. p

Positive 348 pNormally we didnt have any API that lets us to intercept and change or not the AudioQueues pcm data. So we had to somewhat delay the audio by first sending it to audio conversion APIs... That doesnt work meaningfully for streaming audio apps.p  pWith all the latest additions to iOS, I couldnt figure out if it is directly possible to be able to reachchange decoded PCM data right before the device plays it from AudioQueue.p  pAAC audio  pushed to Audio Queue buffers  [Our man in the middle receives decoded data and if it has nothing to do passes it again without touching anything]  AudioQueue plays the buffer through speaker.p  pI know that AudioUnits may be the way to go, but for now, I have to stay with AudioQueue.p  pIs there a way to do this easily with the latest iOS SDK Like audio taps, etcp

Positive 348 pThere was a website where you could download different kind of material mostly for websites, applications etc. You could find material such as sound effects, vector images, icons etc  I might be wrong with some to material content here. There was a different website for each one of these and their name were something like duneofimages, oceanofsoundeffects etc. Most of the material was sold with a small price. Can you provide me the address of this website You will now if it you are a website designer. Its something like github which is no free.p

Positive 348 pAs is demonstrated in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma328794283681880this answera, I have recently learned how to play audio files using both codeAVAudioPlayercode and codeAudioToolboxcode. I have successfully played a single audio test file using both methods. However, I want to ask about which one I should actually use in my app or if it even matters. p  pHere are the relevant characteristics of my appp  ul liThere are about 800 audio clips.li liMost of the clips last less than one second.li liAny could be chosen to be played at random by the user, but only a small subset will be used on any particular run.li liNo special volume control or playback options are needed.li ul  pThese are my questionsp  ul liWhich method for playing a sound would be better Whyli liShould I preload the sounds or just load them when they are needed Im guessing that preloading 800 sounds every time is a bad idea. But if I wait to load them until they are needed, I am worried about performance ie, a noticeable pause before the clip is playedli liDo I need to play sounds on a background threadli ul  pSo my concerns in choosing which audio player to go with are memory and performance. I couldnt tell from any of the documentation that I saw which is better in this case.p

Positive 348 pIm working on an iOS app which uses the IMAAdsManager to display Ads served by the IMA sdk.p  pWhen we increase the roundtrip latency using Charles Proxy, the Audio Ads timeout and return a failureerror. The app is designed to handle this event, however when this happens other audio in the app fails to play successfully from thereon until the app is restarted.p  pThe weird part is, when I plug in the headphones into the jack, audio continues to play fine. So the audio is working, just not being expelled through the usual route.p  pHas anyone had enough experience with the IMA sdk to know whether my hypothesis is valid, or how to handle the audio problem resulting from the failurep  pThanksp

This is my codep  precode            nextMp  MediaPlayer.createthis, R.raw.arabicnight             mp  MediaPlayer.createthis, R.raw.arabicnight              play  Button findViewByIdR.id.button             play.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener                  Override                 public void onClickView v                      mp.start                     mp.setNextMediaPlayernextMp codepre  pDoes anybody have any suggestions or logic I could use to alternate between the two MediaPlayers indefinitely so that I can achieve a seamless and continuous loop Thanks.p

This code is supposed to play a 440 Hz tone continuously until the page is closed.  The code will play the tone, but after a second or two the sound skips repeatedly, suggesting Ive run out of buffer space and the script isnt being called each buffer period.p  pIm sure the solution to this is simple, but whats actually causing the skipping  How can I get this script to run continuouslyp  pEDIT The skipping goes away if I refresh the page.  Is this a browser bugp
Positive 348 pThe remote device is sending live raw PCM audiono header included in UDP packets and I need to implement a program in java to receive these packets and play them on the PC live. As I know that raw PCMs attributes are 16bit, mono, sampling rate 24KHz, so I tried to add a wav header to this raw PCM audio and play but the problem is I dont have File size of the audio.p  pI also implemented a program based on a hrefhttpwww.wikijava.orgwikiPlayawavesoundinJava relnofollowthis linka but it only gives noise in output.p  pI am bound to use UDP and I can get only raw PCM from remote device, so is their any library or API by which I can play this raw audio on PCp

Positive 348 pI have to migrate a legacy project from Windows Media to HTML5 videoaudio. The system should provide videoaudio content to the web user meeting following criteria  p  ol liPlayout Segments TcIn to TcOut of large videoaudio files should be played on the fly to the web user. Cutting the source material into segments does not work because there is a high overlap rate between segments, so 34 times more HDD space and a lot of extra programming would be needed. Markered playout of the large source files is not an option either as there are forbidden parts of the source material which should never be available to the user.li liCutting In general, users are permitted to make copies of the material. Indeed, by using the dowload function, users can download selected segments. I guess, this is not a problem a service starts a cutting software probably ffmpeg that cuts the video, and the user is notified by email to download the product. Thats the way I do it now but there might be a more simple option.li liFormats what is the preferred videoaudio format that most browsers Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Android supportli liServer If possible, I would keep Windows Server because the database behind is MS SQL Server.  li ol  pWindows Media Server and WMEncoder currently works fine for all the above, however WM is not suppored by browsers any more. That is the reason for reengineering.  p  pI would appreciate any of your suggestions on how to rebuild this videoaudio system. What software elements to use and how.  p  pThank you.p

Negative 348 pWe are developing a middleware SDK, both in C and Java to be used as a libraryDLL by, for example, game developers, animation software developers, Avatar developers to enhance their products.p  pHaving created a typical API using specific calls for specific functions I am considering simplifying the API by using a REST type API GET, PUT, POST, DELETE or CRUD type CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE interface.p  pThis would work in a similar way to a clientserver type REST API where there are only 4 possible API calls but these can take flexible parameters.p  pThis seems to have the benefit of making the API stable in that new calls are not being added and old calls are not being removed. So a consumer of this API need not worry about having to recompile and change their code to suit any updates to our middleware.p  pThe overhead is that there is an extra layer of redirection in the middleware controller to route API calls and the developer needs to know what parameters are available for each REST call supplied of course.p  pI have not so far seen this system used outside of web type client server applications so my question is this Is this a feasible ideap  pI am thinking in terms of its efficiency as well as if for example a game developer would find it easy to use.p

Negative 348 pWe have many projects that use a common base of shared components dlls.  Currently the development build for each project links against dlls built from the trunk of the components. ie trunk builds use the dlls from other trunk buildsp  pWhen we do a release build, we have a script that goes through the project files and replaces the trunk references to specific numbered versions of the components that are built from a tagged branch p  pI think this weakens the testing that we do during development because the project that I am actually working on is using diferent dlls to what the release build will be using. I would like to always develop against the numbered versions of the components and only ever update them when there is a specific need.p  pHowever others in the team argue that unless we develop against trunk and update to the newer versions of the components with each release we will have the problem that a our products will hardly ever update to the newer version of the components then b when we do need to update it will be a huge task because the component sourceinterfaces will have changed so much.p  pWhat practices do you follow, and whyp  pEdit Sorry all, I have just realised I have confused things by mentioning that there are several main products sharing components  although they share the components they dont run on the same PCs. My concern relates to the fact the because the components are likely to change with each release of a product even though there was no specific requirement to update the component that testing would miss some subtle change that was done in a component and not related to the specific work being done on the product. p

Negative 348 pIn httpd.conf I havep  precodeltPerlgt    MyPackagefoo   ...  ltPerlgt codepre  pAccording to the docs, this should, since its qualified, persist into my perl scripts, which are run with the modperl handler.  And sometimes they do.  But then all I need to do is touch MyPackage.pm, and all of the sudden MyPackagefoo is now undef.  Restart the web server, and it works again.p  pAnybody have an end to my tearsp  pMy best guess is that the block only gets run once, when the .conf is parsed, and then a new thread picks up the reloaded file.

Negative 348 pI have an object, a Timeline, that encapsulates a thread. Events can be scheduled on the timeline the thread will wait until it is time to execute any event, execute it, and go back to sleep for either a the time it takes to get to the next event or b indefinitely if there are no more events.p  pThe sleeping is handled with a WaitEventHandle, which is triggered when the list of event is altered because the sleep delay may need to be adjusted or when the thread should be stopped so the thread can terminate gracefully.p  pThe destructor calls Stop, and Ive even implemented IDisposable and Dispose also calls Stop.p  pStill, when I use this component in a forms application, my application will never shut down properly when I close the form. For some reason, Stop is never called, so neither my objects destructor triggers, nor is the Dispose method called, embeforeem .NET decides to wait for all threads to finish.p  pI suppose the solution would be to explicitly call Dispose myself on the FormClose event, but since this class is going to be in a library, emandem it is actually a layer deeper that is, the application developer will never actually see the Timeline class, this seems very ugly and an extra unnecessary gotcha for the application developer. The using clause, which I would normally use when resource release becomes an issue, doesnt apply as this is going to be a longlived object.p  pOn the one hand, I can understand that .NET will want to wait for all threads to finish before it does its final round of garbage collection, but in this case that produces a very clumsy situation.p  pHow can I make my thread clean up after itself properly without adding requirements to consumers of my library Put another way, how can I make .NET notify my object when the application is exiting, but before it will wait for all threads to finishp  phr p  pEDIT In response to the people saying that it is ok for the client program to be aware of the thread I respectfully disagree.p  pAs I said in my original post, the thread is hidden away in another object an Animator. I instantiate an Animator for another object, and I tell it to perform animations, such as blink this light for 800ms. p  pAs a consumer of the Animator object, I do not care how the Animator makes sure that the light blinks for exactly 800ms. Does it start a thread I dont care. Does it create a hidden window and use system timers ew I dont care. Does it hire midgets to turn my light on and off I dont care.p  pAnd I emespeciallyem dont want to have to care that if I ever create an Animator, I have to  keep track of it and call a special method when my program exits, in contrast to every other object. It should be a concern of the library implementor, not the library consumer.p  phr p  pEDIT The code is actually short enough to show.

Negative 348 pMy site uses a php function to tweet an update whenever an event occurs.

For my application though theres only one twitter account and it doesnt belong to the user who initiates the action who may not even know or care that he is initiating a tweet.p  pSo how do I do this The best option I can think of is to build a onetimeuse script which will let me request an access token, then hard code that token into the sendTweet function. That seems like a lot of overkill for such a simple application, and it creates a potential problem down the road if Twitter ever expires the access token. The docs say they probably never will, but that applications should be designed to handle it gracefully if they do.p  pDoes anyone have experience with a project like this Is there a simpler and more graceful way to do itp

Negative 348 pIm trying to implement an application that coordinates multiple users who are scheduling exclusive resources. The schedule data must maintain strong consistency over a network with a single master node. The scheduled resources could be anything from a conference room to a worker on a job site.p  pWe assume the conference room cannot be scheduled for two meetings at once and a worker cannot be on two job sites at the same time.  The business logic of the application must not allow a user to overbook a resource.p  pWhat I cant figure out is how to represent the data so that if two or more users operate on the schedule at the same time, and there are conflicts, one of the updates will abort.p  pThe only solution Ive seen so far is to track time slots for each exclusionary resource. So if the conference room is used on 5 min intervals, and it was scheduled for 9930am, then the corresponding 5 minute time slots for 9930am would all return TRUE, while the unscheduled slots would return FALSE or NULL.  The DB transaction would then pull the conference room object out of the store, check all the time slots, and abort if the update conflicted with existing time slots.p  pHowever, this seems like it will get really big, really fast.  Perhaps it could be garbage collected  Also, one of the goals of the design is to support variable granularity, so some objects will get scheduled on a minute to minute basis while others could be on a day to day basis, and this data design does not support that very well.p  pCurrently, I am trying to implement this on Google App Engine using Python, but I would be really interested to see some more general solutions to this problem.  All Ive come up with Googling is scheduling recurring tasks, or algorithms that perform one time operations to automatically build optimized schedules.p

Negative 348 pIs there any way to randomly generate a set of positive numbers such that they have a desired mean and standard deviation  p  pI have an algorithm to generate numbers with a gaussian distribution, but I dont know how to deal with negative numbers in a way the preserves the mean and standard deviation.br It looks like a poisson distribution might be a good approximation, but it takes only a mean.p  pEDIT Theres been some confusion in the responses so Ill try to clarify. p  pI have a set of numbers that give me a mean and a standard deviation.

The one thing that I know is different, however, is that the production server has a lower version of MySQL lower than recommended for Drupal 6  were waiting on the hosting company being able to change this later. Would it make sense that the old version of MySQL is unable to do pagination correctly in Drupal 6 If so, does anyone know a workaround I can do until we are able to update MySQLp

Negative 348 pIn my current project we have a large repository of content that was originally published in book form. Much of this content was published in both English and many foreign languages, using mostly Quark Express and later InDesign. This content was exported into a custom XML structure for storage and future use. The issue is that the English XML was exported and then enhanced in both structure and meta data over time by editors which left the structure of the Foreign language XML different from the English Version. For examplep  pEnglish XMLp  precodeltchapter metameta data addedgt     ltsection metasome meta about the sectiongt         ltparagraphgtsome english paragraphltparagraphgt         ltlistgt             ltligtsome english list itemltligt         ltlistgt     ltsectiongt ltchaptergt codepre  pForeign XMLp  precodeltchaptergt     ltsectiongt         ltparagraphgtsome original foreign language paragraphltparagraphgt     ltsectiongt ltchaptergt codepre  pAs you can see there are at times strongmissing elementsstrong as well as strongmissing attributesstrong. The problem is at this point we want to compare the Foreign Language structure to the english, add in the missing meta data attributes and elements, and then report on nontranslated parts of the XML.p  pThe current process to complete this involves stripping the element data out and placing it into a web application. From there I allow a user to go in and match a foreign language paragraph with its english counterpart using Jquery to allow them to just click on the item and then the match and save this data as an attribute by unique ID. At that point I know which elements match between the two language documents and then I can flow the foreign language content into the English structured XML. This leaves me with the foreign language content marked by uniqueID inside the English structured XML which I can query for elements without a unique ID so that I can know which items need to be translated.p  pThis process works fine, however it is quite manual, requiring someone to go in and hand click the paragraphs. With literally hundreds of thousands of pages of content to go through, I am looking for ways to further automate the process. Are there better ways to compare XML documents for structure so that the above goals can be completed with less manual interventionp  pThe current process uses C, ASP.Net, Linq to XML and Jquery among other things. But the language and tools are irrelevant I just want to find a more automated solution. If it uses a DB, no problem. If we need to switch platforms, I dont mind. Its a matter of implementation rather than language. Thanksp

But that seems okay right  When the user hits the back button dealloc will be called on FooView and [theFoo release] will be called.  Then another back button is hit and dealloc is called on the tableview class and [fooList release] is called.p  pYou might argue that the FooView class should havep  pre property nonatomic, assign Foo theFoo pre  pvs. retain.  But sometimes the FooView class is called with a Foo thats not also in an array.  So I wanted to make sure it was okay to have two objects holding on to the same other object.p

Negative 348 pI have a scenario where I want to dynamically add words of text to a container so that it forms a paragraph of text which is wrapped neatly according to the size of the parent container.  Each text element will have differing formatting, and will have differing user interaction options.  For example, imagine the text  has just spoken out about .  Each word will be added to the container one at a time, at run time. The username in this case would be bold, and if clicked on will trigger an event.  Same with the news article.  The rest of the text is just plain text which, when clicked on, would do nothing.p  pNow, Im using Flex 3 so I dont have access to the fancy new text formatting tools.  Ive implemented a solution where the words are plotted onto a canvas, but this means that the words are wrapped at a particular y position an arbitrary value Ive chosen.  When the container is resized, the words still wrap at that position which leaves lots of space.p  pI thought about adding each text element to an Array Collection and using this as a datasource for a Tile List, but Tile Lists dont support variable column widths in my limited knowledge so each word would use the same amount of space which isnt ideal.p  pDoes anyone know how I can plot words onto a container so that I can retain formatting, events and word wrapping at paragraph level, even if the container is resizedp

But it gets bad if you try to put breakpoint into the event. Why I mean event is not run in the same thread that the windows hook is. That means that It shouldnt block HookCallback. It does however... p  pI would really like to know why is this happening. My theory is that Visual Studio when breaking execution temporarily stops all threads and that means that HookCallback is blocked...

Negative 348 pIm wondering if there is a simple way of creating a duplicate ModelForm in Django  i.e. a form that is prefilled with the content of an existing model instance excepting certain fields, such as those that are unique, but creates a new instance when saved.p  pI was thinking along the lines of supplying an instance to a ModelForm so that the data is prefilled as with an edit form, then setting the instance to None before saving, but this gives a NoneType object has no attribute pk error when calling .save on the form. It seems the act of supplying an instance when constructing the form creates some dependency on it being there at the end.p  pI have had trouble finding a solution to this problem, but I cant imagine a duplicate form being too unique, so maybe I am missing something simplep  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 348 pI am writing a full database extract program in java. Database is Oracle, and it is huge. Some tables have 260 million records. The program should create one file per table in a specific format, so using Oracle datapump etc is not an option. Also, some company security policies do not allow to write a PLSQL procedure to create files on DB server  for this requirement. I have to go with Java and JDBC.p  pThe issue I am facing is that Since files for some of the table is huge 30GB I am running out of memory almost every time even with a 20GB Java Heap. During the creation of file when the file size exceeds the heap size, even with one of the most aggressive GC policy, the process seems to hangup. For example if the file size is  20GB and heap size is 20GB, once heap utilization hits max heap size, its slows down writing 2MB per minute or so and at this speed, it will take months to get full extract.p  pI am looking for some way to overcome this issue.

Negative 348 pIm having a weird issue with form painting in the Compact Framework. I have a login dialog that is basically a small form that is opened on top of another using ShowDialog. When a card is swiped, the login dialog is supposed to close, then some login tasks are performed and then the form behind it should be activated. The problem is that the form behind the login dialog is not being refreshed and so the login dialog will not be removed until after the form behind is refreshed by some user action. This is probably due to the heavy processing that goes on in the login tasks part, but Ive not found a way to solve this.p  pBasically, I want a way to force the application to close the dialog and paint everything again, before performing the heavy login tasks.

Negative 348 pSo, my company finally upgraded to MS Office 2010.  Up until now Ive been working in 2003. I am a SQL programmer, and I constantly create reports in Excel that pull data from our database. Most of the time, I will create macros that accept parameters that the users will type into specific cells, alter the query, and then refresh it according to the parameters. p  pHere is a really simple example  p  ol liIn Excel 2003 I would open a new workbook.li liClick on Data then Import External Data then New Database Query.  li liIt then prompts you to choose a data source, so I would select the database I wanted to query from which had been set up with an ODBC connection already.  li lipI then cancel out of the Query Wizard windows and then when Im in the Microsoft Query Editor, I just enter in my query. p  ul lipFor simplicity, Ill be selecting codecode from a table called codeAgentscode which is just a list of the agents that work for the company and their codeEmployeeIdscode.pli lipcodeselect  from Agentscodepli ulli lipThen I x out of the query editor, and a box pops up called Import Data where it asks where you want to put the data in an existing worksheet a new worksheet etc. I just have it return the data in the existing worksheet starting in Cell codeA2codepli ol  pSo then I write this simple macro in the Visual Basic Editor in a module for the workbookp  precodeSub Refresh  Dim oQuery as QueryTable Dim oAgent as String  set oQuery  Sheet1.QueryTables1  oAgent  Sheet1.RangeA1  oQuery.CommandText  select  from Agents where Agent  oAgent oQuery.Refresh  End Sub codepre  pI create a button that runs this macro and stick it in codeB1code. So the user opens the report, types a name into codeA1code, hits the button and that Agent and their Id comes up in the table below. Really simple right But I cant get this to work in Excel 2010.p  pHere are my steps and the error that followsp  ol liI open Excel 2010, and go to the Data tab.  li liUnder the section Get External Data I click on From Other Sources and select From Mircrosoft Query from the drop down.li liThen the Choose Data Source box pops up and it is basically the exact same as steps 3,4 and 5 above.li ol  pThen I write the same macro, create the button and assign it to the marco, but when I click the button I get the following errorp  precodeRuntime error 9 Subscript out of range codepre  pI hit debug and the debugger highlights this linep  precodeSet oQuery  Sheet1.QueryTables1 codepre  pI tried making this line more specific like sop  precodeSet oQuery  WorkBooksBook 1.SheetsSheet 1.QueryTables1 codepre  pBut I just get the same error.p  pSo basically what I need to know is how to do this type of thing in Excel 2010. But here is an interesting note if I create this report in Excel 2003, save it as a .xls, then open it in 2010, it will work. I can even save a copy as a .xlsm then open that and it will work with this same macro. Its only when I create the report in 2010 that I cant get it to work. It seems for some reason that it just cant find the query to alter its command text and then refresh. Please help, Ive been stuck on this for daysp

Negative 348 pIn my developments I am slowly moving from an objectoriented approach to interfacebasedprogramming approach.  More preciselyp  ul liin the past I was already satisfied if I could group logic in a classli linow I tend to put more logic behind an interface and let a factory create the implementationli ul  pA simple example clarifies this.p  pIn the past I wrote these classesp  ul liLibraryli liBookli ul  pNow I write these classesp  ul liILibraryli liLibraryli liLibraryFactoryli liIBookli liBookli liBookFactoryli ul  pThis approach allows me to easily implement mocking classes for each of my interfaces, and to switch between old, slower implementations and new, faster implementations, and compare them both within the same application.p  pFor most cases this works very good, but it becomes a problem if I want to use iterators to loop over collections.p  pSuppose my Library has a collection of books and I want to iterator over them.  In the past this wasnt a problem Librarybegin and Libraryend returned an iterator Libraryiterator on which I could easily write a loop, like thisp  precodefor Libraryiterator itmyLibrary.beginitmylibrary.endit ... codepre  pProblem is that in the interfacebased approach, there is no guarantee that different implementations of ILibrary use the same kind of iterator.  If e.g. OldLibrary and NewLibrary both inherit from ILibrary, thenp  ul liOldLibrary could use an stdvector to store its books, and return stdvectorconstiterator in its begin and end methodsli liNewLibrary could use an stdlist to store its books, and return stdlistconstiterator in its begin and end methodsli ul  pRequiring both ILibrary implementations to return the same kind of iterator isnt a solution either, since in practice the increment operation it needs to be implemented differently in both implementations.p  pThis means that in practice I have to make the iterator an interface as well, meaning that application cant put the iterator on the stack typical C slicing problem.p  pI could solve this problem by wrapping the iteratorinterface within a noninterface class, but this seems a quite complex solution for what I try to obtian.p  pAre there better ways to handle this problemp  pstrongEDITstrong Some clarifications after remarks made by Martin.p  pSuppose I have a class that returns all books sorted on popularity LibraryBookFinder. It has begin and end methods that return a LibraryBookFinderconstiterator which refers to a book.p  pTo replace my old implementation with a brand new one, I want to put the old LibraryBookFinder behind an interface ILibraryBookFinder, and rename the old implementation to OldSlowLibraryBookFinder.p  pThen my new blistering fast implementation called VeryFastCachingLibraryBookFinder can inherit from ILibraryBookFinder.  This is where the iterator problem comes from.p  pNext step could be to hide the interface behind a factory, where I can ask the factory give me a finder that is very good at returning books according popularity, or according title, or author, ....  You end up with code like thisp  precodeILibraryBookFinder myFinder  LibraryBookFinderFactory FINDERPOPULARITY for ILibraryBookFinderconstiterator itmyFindergtbeginitmyFinder.endit ... codepre  por if I want to use another criteriap  precodeILibraryBookFinder myFinder  LibraryBookFinderFactory FINDERAUTHOR for ILibraryBookFinderconstiterator itmyFindergtbeginitmyFinder.endit ... codepre  pThe argument of LibraryBookFinderFactory may be determined by an external factor a configuration setting, a command line option, a selection in a dialog, ...  And every implementation has its own kind of optimizations e.g. the author of a book doesnt change so this can be a quite static cache the popularity can change daily which may imply a totally different data structure.p

This tends to interact poorly when multiple applications are in play that use connection pools, since many of those open up their full suite of connections and hold them idle.p  pAs soon as there are more than a couple of applications in contact with the DB, we run out of connections, as youd expect.p  pPooling behaviour is a new thing here until now weve managed pooled connections by serializing access to them through a webbased DB gateway  or by not pooling anything at all. As a consequence, Im having to explain literally, 5 trouble tickets from one person over the course of the project over and over again how the pooling works.p  pWhat I want is one of the followingp  ol lipA solid, inarguable rationale for increasing the number of available connections to the database in order to play nice with pools.br If so, whats a safe limit Is there any reason to keep the limit to 20pli lipA reason why Im wrong and we should cut the size of the pools down or eliminate them altogether.pli ol  pFor what its worth, here are the components in play.

Negative 348 h2Backgroundh2  pI written an R package, and now a collaborator recent CS grad who is new to R is editing and refactoring the code. In the process, he is dividing up my functions into smaller, more generic functions.   p  pWhat he is doing makes sense, but when I started with codepackage.skeletoncode, I had one file per function. Now, he has added functions on which the primary function depends, but that may have limited use outside the function itself.p  pHe suggests that all the functions go into a single file, but I am against that because it is easier to do version control when we work on different files.p  pI have since started using roxygen to document each function within the text.p  h2Questionh2  pWhat is the recommended way to handle functions clearly the helper functions should stay with the the main function, but to what extent do I need to document helper functionsp  pThe codeexportcode suggestion in the comments is helpful, but I am curious to know how others organize their code.p

Negative 348 pIm trying to develop a simple a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgweholteditra.djangomanagement relnofollowplugina for the a hrefhttpeditra.org relnofollowEditraa editor for django development. Right now it can create django projects and apps from within the editor. The editor is based on wxPython and I want to start the devserver from within the editor, show a simple form with the option to stop or killrestart the server.p  pThe goal is to minimize the need to do repetetive tasks in the consoleshell. My reason for doing this is that I am working in a Microsoft only company where you seldom do stuff using the command line. Selling django is hard when I am in and out of the shellcommand line to startrestart the server, syncdb, migrate etc. To make the job of selling django to my coworkers and hopefully make development easier  at least for the django developers who likes to work in an IDE  I have started the work on a plugin for Editra.p  pRight now the plugin adds a menu item called Django with two subitems create project and create app. A context menu is in the works which will give different options depending on the content of the file being edited right click in a window holding settings.py will give you the option to start the devserver, call syncdb, migrate if south is installed, create superuser etc. A right click in views.py will give you options to help you generate views or templates, in models.py scaffolding or generation of admin.py etc.p  pThe only thing I cannot get my head around is how to startkillrestart the devserver from inside the app. What I really like is to have a small window floating around with two buttons stop or restart, which will  stop or restart the devserver. Or a play and stop button inside the editor doing the same thing. The problem is controlling the devserver process from within the app.p  pIf anybody has any information about this I would be very grateful. Any help, input, comments or ideas are appreciated.p  pRegards, Thomas Weholtp

Negative 348 pI have recently started working with Perl. Googling reveals a number of editors but I am unable to find an editor that will help me navigate a large body of Perl source code.

Negative 348 pI know there are plenty of tools for .NET languages that work with XML comments to ease documentation such as AtomineerUtils and GhostDoc but they all require that the documentation be kept in  or  comments within the code files themselves.p  pHowever I dont like this because I often work with files that have large XML comments 3 paragraphs per method, maybe a paragraph per field and these make it hard to browse and work with the source file because the comments get in the way.p  pI know you can import external comments with ltinclude gt and thats good, but Id like to be able to document my codes without even using that.p  pThat said, if there are tools that automate ltinclude gt comments then Id go for that.p  pThanksp
Negative 348 pi am working on an android application in which i have a slideshow of ten images at most and every image has associated text with it which is displayed. when i clicktap on some image the images is enlarged and text does not appear until i tap the screen again, that fine up till now. But when i change the orientation of the device or emulator then images is displayed but text portion displays null. which is definitely not required. the same text should be displayed as was before orientation change.p  pOne more thing to make it clearer is that when null displays, and i change the slideshow image then text appears fine , but again when change orientation same thing repeats.p  pHelp me avoiding this null. Thanks.p
Negative 348 pI am trying to show a customer errors page in ASP.NET when the database is down. I use the SQL Server mode to hold the session data. The problem is that the custom errors page is never called. p  pSince the session data and the database are on the same server, this does not redirect to the custom error page Im guessing the web application has not loaded at this point.  The user is presented with the stack trace for the session state connection failure.p  pIt seems that we need something that sits in front of the initial website load to check connectivity to the database. Any ideas on how to implement thisp

Negative 348 pSo I decided to install python packages technically Django apps directly from the downloaded tar file, by extracting it and using the following commandp  precodepython setup.py install codepre  pHowever, inside my sitepackages directory I find that the package was installed inside a .egg directory that also has version numbers. They directories look annoyingly like thisp  precodesitepackagesdjangocms2.1.3py2.7.eggcms sitepackagesdjangocms2.1.3py2.7.eggmptt codepre  pI need the packages to install as a directory with the package name with no .egg or version number, otherwise Django cant find the package. It should be like thisp  precodesitepackagescms sitepackagesmptt codepre  pAttempting to install the same package from pip, and it works fine. This is frustrating, so some help would be appreciated.p  pI tracked down a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6301003stoppingsetuppyfrominstallingaseggthreada that discusses something similar, but it didnt give a solution that worked.p  pedit Let me further explain, the python django project is unable to locate the packages I installed, because the packages arent installed at the root of sitepackages dir. Instead it resides inside the .egg directories. What I had to do is manuall move the package to the root, but how do you correctly install python packagesp  panother edit I didnt suppress the easyinstall.pth file, but it isnt picked up by PyDev.p

Negative 348 pWhat JavaSelenium commands can I use to capturegetoutput for all elements and associated element locators for a single webpage The Selenium IDE allows you to inspect one element at a time. That is a problem if you have thousands of elements to automate. Is there a tool or Javaselenium command that I can use to get all of the objectselements on my web page at once and then maybe customize the output to suite my needs If you have any experience with SilkTest, Id like something analogous to generating Window Declarations in SilkTest. SilkTests Record Window Declaration tool captures tagpropertylocator information for all of the objectselements on a page and allows you to paste the code to your library or include file. So with one or two clicks I can capture and define dozens of objects in SilkTest. Is there a tool or command that does something similar for Selenium Im using Java so Id like any examples in Java.

Negative 348 pI have a large query that joins around 20 tables mostly outer joins. It is using the older join syntax with commas and where conditions with  for outer joins.  We noticed that it is consuming a lot of server memory. We are trying several things among which one idea is to convert this query to use the newer ANSI syntax, since the ANSI syntax allows better control on the order of JOINs and also specifies the JOIN predicates explicitly as they are applied.p  pDoes converting the query from an older syntax to the newer ANSI syntax help in reducing the amount of data processed, for such large queries spanning a good number of tables p

Negative 348 pI am creating an application where each tab has different screens to switch between. Originally I was going to have each tab show a different activity but from what I have read, it seems that is a bad way of doing it.p  pSo I have been using an xml file which has the layout for each screen all in the one file. And I use Java to program which to display each screen required and hide the ones I dont need. The problem I have with this approach is it means all my Java is one file, and all my XML is in one file. Could someone explain to me a better way of doing this as I am pretty sure there must be a better way. My activity has many screens and its getting an eye sore scrolling through all this code at once, as the more screens I add, the larger the code is getting.p  pIdeally I would like to have the code for each screen in its own Java class, and the layouts for each screen in their own xml files and just switch between these. p  pTo give you example of my codep  precodeltTabHost androidididtabhost androidlayoutwidthfillparent androidwindowSoftInputModeadjustResize xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidbackground92c223 androidlayoutheightfillparentgt  ltLinearLayout androidididtab1 androidlayoutaboveandroididtabs    androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt         ltScrollView androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt             ltRelativeLayout androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt XML CODE FOR LAYOUT GOES IN HERE.

Negative 348 pI was wondering if it is possible to make a Java EE application being managed by Maven and automatically deploy it to JBoss all from Eclipse.

Negative 348 pIm working on a WPF project build a couple of years ago. p  pOne control is an expander control which groups a list of checkcontrols. p  pThis list of checkcontrols is arranged from Left to Right, Top to Bottom by a WrapPanelp  pstrongNow my goal is to  arrange the checkcontrols from Top to Bottom, Left to Right where the vertical wrap occurs at the bottom of the parent window Any tipsdirections in how to achieve this would be awsomestrongp  pI have extracted the issue in a code example to highlight the issue. p  pstrongBehavior of the examplestrong  The code example has the WrapPanels orientation set to Horizontal. This is to show you what sort of behavior I would like to achieve  The wrap breaks at the Right side of the parent window and a new row starts. When the checkcontrols overflow the Bottom of the screen a vertical scrollbar appears.p  pstrongBehavior I would like to achievestrong  When the Bottom side of the parent window is reached when the wrappanel is set to Vertical orientation I want the wrap to break and start at the Top again. When the checkcontrols overflow the Right side of the window I want a horizontal scrollbar to appear.p  pstrongExamplestrong  In the code change the Orientation attribute of the Wrappanel to Vertical. Notice that there is only one column overflowing all the way down, there is no wrap at the bottom of the window  Because Im not sure how to attach a zip file with the demo project I have added the code files below.  Creating a WPF application .net framework 3.5 and copying the code in the proper locations should do.  If you do have issues running the example I can always mail you a VS2010 solution p  pProject called VerticalWrapPanelp  pstrongUserControl CheckControl.xamlstrongp  precodeltUserControl

Negative 348 pI am currenty writing my masters thesis about monitoring of distributed systems. For this purpose I have designed a framework that can record monitoring data and analyze this data in a series of filters pipes and filter style. It is based on the a hrefhttpsse.informatik.unikiel.dekieker relnofollowKieker monitoring frameworka.p  pYou can connect the different filters to each other by subscribing to an output port, like sop  precodeDurationFilter durationFilter  new DurationFilter Timeline timeline  new Timeline... durationFilter.getOutputPort.subscribetimeline codepre  pThis mechanism is provided by the Kieker framework which I am using.p  pTo run an analysis the user currently has to connect the filters manually by writing out the code. What I want to do now is write a tool with a GUI that makes it easier to create a configuration set of filters, input files and the connections. Ideally the user could do it like in a UML editor, creating boxes filters and connecting them with lines connections and set the parameters for input input files etc.p  pThese configurations then need to be executed, meaning I need a mapping from the graph to the code to the java code. That was my idea so far. First off do you think this approach is the right one for this taskp  pIn my research I found the framework a hrefhttpwww.randelshofer.choopjhotdraw relnofollowJHotDrawa which has a lot of the features I just mentioned. With JHotDraw I can create the visual elements Figures on a drawing area DrawingEditor including a set of tools to create, edit and connect the elements. This I have done and its pretty straightforward. A bonus is the undoredo functionality of JHotDraw.p  pNow my problem I am not sure how I am supposed to get from the graphical representation in the editor to the java code. What I have is the Vpart of the MVC pattern which the framework supposedly uses. The Figures are the view. But where does the model go and how does it integrate into the framework I am thinking that for every element that is displayed in the DrawingEditor I will have to have a corresponding model that stores the data for the element. A FilterModel would have attributes like input data types which data can it process, output ports and their data types what kind of data does it create and the type of the filter corresponds to the Java class.

Negative 348 pRecently a new concept of a hrefhttpjunit.sourceforge.netdocReleaseNotes4.4.htmlTheories relnofollowTheoriesa was added to JUnit since v4.4.p  pIn a nutshell, you can mark your test method with codeTheorycode annotation instead of codeTestcode, make your test method parametrized and declare an array of parameters, marked with codeDataPointscode annotation somewhere in the same class. p  pJUnit will sequentially run your parametrized test method passing parameters retrieved from codeDataPointscode one after another. But only until the first such invocation fails due to any reason.p  pThe concept seems to be very similar to codeDataProviderscode from TestNG, but when we use data providers, all the scenarios are run inspite of their execution results. And its useful because you can see how many scenarious workdont work and you can fix your program more effectively.p  pSo, I wonder whats the reason not to execute codeTheorycodemarked method for every codeDataPointcode It appears not so difficult to inherit from Theories runner and make a custom runner which will ignore failures but why dont we have such behaviour out of the boxp  pstrongUPDstrong I have created a faulttolerant version of Theories runner and made it available for a public access a hrefhttpsgithub.comrgorodischerfaulttoleranttheories relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrgorodischerfaulttoleranttheoriesap  pIn order to compare it with the standard Theories runner run StandardTheoriesBehaviorDemo then FaultTolerantTheoriesBehaviorDemo which are placed under codesrctest...code folder.  p

Negative 348 pPlease bear with me through this question.  I have written an app that allows the user to create a deal that they will need to submit, but before the deal can be submitted it will need to be validated.  I do some of the validation in the business layer, but alot of the validation is done when I call a package that was written by one of our Oracle developers.  When I run the code locally and set a few breakpoints it takes his package about 10 minutes to run but seems to come back fine. p  pNow the problem is once the app is deployed out to a box it seems like his oracle package never returns so the app just seems to hang forever.  When we look into the DB, we can see that after about 10 minutes its no longer running his validation.  Does anyone have any solid ideas about what is causing this and if so, ways that I can 1 see what is happeneing and 2 fix it.  p

However, I am not aware of any method to take full control of the enabled state of repurposed builtin controls.

I thought a JWindow is the best pick, and also the Swing documentation points out to use a JWindow for such purposes floating window, which has an owner frame, has no decoration and no windows taskbar entry.p  pMy floating tool windows content consists of several other components like JButtons and also JTextFields.p  h2The problemh2  pWhen I click into the floating tool window, the owner window the JFrame, my main application window flickers occasionally.

If it is false, there is no flicker, the problem is gone. The JavaDoc for that method points outp  blockquote   pSetting a Windows focusability state to false is the standard mechanism for an application to identify to the AWT a Window which will be used as a floating palette or toolbar, and thus should be a nonfocusable Window.p blockquote  pBut then I cant use a JTextField in the floating tool window of course, because I cant focus it maybe a text field in a floating tool window is unusual, but in my case a must.p  pI guess the flicker effect has something to do with the focus management in some way... for the fraction of a second the floating tool window gets the focus, taking it away from the owner window and then back. But Im not sure as a side note if the text field in the floating tool window has the focus, the owner window stays enabled which is a correct behavior.p  pI hope there is an easy solution, one so that I can stay with the JWindow as my floating tool window and with text fields as its content  because, apart from the described flicker problem, everything works great.p  pI really appreciate any help, thanks a lotp

If I did the save point, then I will ROLLBACK TRANSACTION MySavePointName.  This scenario seems to work great.p  pHere is where I get a little confused  if I want to keep the work Ive done, if I started a transaction I will execute COMMIT TRANSACTION. But if I created a save point  I tried COMMIT TRANSACTION MySavePointName, but then the caller tries to commit its transaction and gets an error The COMMIT TRANSACTION request has no corresponding BEGIN TRANSACTION.  So Im wondering then  a save point can be rolled back that works ROLLBACK TRANSACTION MySavePointName will NOT roll back the callers transaction.  But perhaps one never needs to commit it  It just stays there, in case you need to roll back to it, but goes away once the original transaction is committed or rolled backp  pIf there is a better way to nest a transaction, please shed some light as well.  I havent figured out how to nest with BEGIN TRANSACTION but only rollback or commit my internal transaction.  Seems ROLLBACK will always roll back to the top transaction, while COMMIT simply decrements trancount.p
Negative 348 pIm trying to get the value of an inherited CSS property using Javascript. I havent been able to find a comprehensive answer.p  pExample CSSp  precodediv      width 80  codepre  pExample Markupp  precodeltdiv idmydivgt Some text ltdivgt codepre  pUsing javascript jQuery, or native, I need to get the width of the element not in pixels, but the string 80.p  precodemydiv.csswidth  returns in px mydiv[0].style.width  empty string getComputedStylemydiv[0].width  returns in px codepre  pThe reason I need the value as a string is because I need to copy the style to another element.

If its declared in px, the other value needs to be in px.p  pThe real trick is that this property could be inherited, not declared explicitly on the element as in my example.p  pDoes anyone have any ideasp

Negative 348 pWhen use make to compile my code and use MD5 or SHA1 to verify if the files are the same, the hash is different each time. Iam using OSX 10.7p  pMy first guess was its because the files are created at different times so the time stamp which is save in the file is different therefore the file and hashes are different. But is this timestamp really hashed or left out like the filenamep  pIf so, what is the best way to compare to compiled files to verify if they were compiled the same wayp  pEDIT Iam using the gcc 4.2.1p

Negative 348 pDisclaimer Im very new to RSpec and TDD in general, so I may be going about this the wrong way entirely.p  pI want to write a commandline interface to my program which takes a command and generates a class to handle it.  The way the program is intended to work is similar to tools like git and svn i.e. you could pass srs init to initialise the program, srs add to add something to it, and so forth.p  pSo I have a class which takes ARGV and passes it off to a specific handler, which looks like thisp  precodeclass CLI     def runarguments         command  arguments.shift         case command         when init             CLIInit.new.runarguments         end     end end codepre  pMy Init handler would then look like thisp  precodeclass CLI     class Init         def initialize         end         def runarguments         end     end end codepre  pI am trying to write a test suite for the CLI classs routing functionality.  RSpec fails if I use the followingp  precodedescribe CLI do     it should launch the Init handler if we pass init do         CLIInit.anyinstance.shouldreceiverun         CLIrun[init]     end end codepre  pHowever it passes if I replace the call to codeCLIruncode with a direct call to the Init handlers run i.e.p  precodedescribe CLI do     it should launch the Init handler if we pass init do         CLIInit.anyinstance.shouldreceiverun         CLIInit.new.run[]     end end codepre  pIt looks as if anyinstance only works on instances definedconstructed within the codedescribecode block, but Im not really sure.  If anyone can offer me any guidance either on how I can check that a class method has been called on an instance constructed inside my coderuncode function, or on a better way to test this functionality in the first place, Id be most appreciative.p

Negative 348 pI have a doubt here where after so much explainations I still dont really get the point. Why do we need to declare a Private Static Methods Since the method is private it can be only accessed by the class itself and the internal function can be called easily without creating an instance, isnt it Or am I wrong for this concept I mean I can understand why we have a private method because we want to keep the logic to only the class itself and I also understand why do we need a static method as we do not need an instance to access the method. So, my question is why do we need to make it static when its private As if we do not want any other class to access it and it cannot be called directly from codes because its private but we still remain it as staticp  pSorry for the confusion but yes I am confused. Can anyone help me on this conceptp  pBest Regards, Yi Yingp

Negative 348 pI work for a very large organization that is looking for new ideas.  Currently there is this large project in place that is supposed to provide a common architecture for a wide variety of applications.  We are organized as many shared components that get used to create a deployable unit or DU, a DU is the final application.p  pWithout going into too much boring and sensitive detail, the way we are doing it now is not working. We have 30 applications and you can wait more than 2 years before getting permission to do anything more than the most desperate emergency fix.  I am looking for suggestions that cover organization and testing.p  pIf you are interested, my idea so far is as followsp  ol liCreate teams based on specialized skills.  For example a GUI team, a JSP team, a Database team, a HTMLCSS team, etc.  When these guys get requests for solutions they are ideally placed to see reuse opportunities which should speed development.  The fact that the team is composed of subject matter experts also means that the quality of the code produced should be better as well.  These teams will produce custom solutions tailored for the request and will contain only what is needed to provide the solution  nothing else.li liCreate a team that works with the business client who will gather requirements and then go to the appropriate specialized team for solutions.  This team will then be responsible for integrating the various solutions into the final application and performing unit testing.li liAs much as possible make use of automated testing tools e.g. JUnit.  Also, in order to maximize the number of applications that can go through user acceptance testing in production like environments you establish short fixed testing durations.  If you are not ready at the end of that time frame you go back to development and unit testing  strongno exceptionsstrong  In other words be damn sure you are ready for user acceptanceproduction before you request it.li ol  pWhat you end up with is two groups of teams.  One groups is application centric, concerned with providing big picture solutions to business clients.  The other group is tech centric, doesnt really know or care about the big picture just their specialty.p  pIs there anything even remotely like what I have just described already out therep

Negative 348 pI have created a program that subscribes to WPFs touch events. Everything has been working as expected over the last few months, but yesterday none of the touch events would fire. I tried creating a new, simple program to test touch events, but it works the same, all of the touch input gets sent as mouse events, even though the cursor changes from the mouse arrow to the touch crosshairs.p  pI restarted the computer several times and reinstalled the drivers but it did not seem to change anything. I have tried using a different brand of touch screen with different drives which also used to work and am seeing the exact same issue. Using the touch screens built in test tool, I can see that touch and multitouch are working as I expect and viewing the  Pen and Touch section of the System Properties confirms that the computer is recognizing the touch screen. p  pEDIT I continued to test the monitor and it appears that multitouch is working in other windows programs like paint. The touch appears to not work only in my applications.p  pHas anyone else experienced this or have any idea how to reenable the touch eventsp

Negative 348 pI have a UITableViewController with a grouped static UITableView. I am defining the cells for my static table view on the storyboard. One of the cells has a textfield in it. When this textfield is called, the keyboard pops up, however, the tableview is not automatically resizing like it normally would on a table view controller. So now the keyboard is partially covering the textfield and I cant scroll up. p  pMy understanding is that when you are using a UITableViewController and a tableview, the viewable area should automatically shrink when the keyboard is called. It does work as intended in other parts of my app, just not with this static table view. Does it not work with static tables Is there something else I am missing Is there an easy way to solve thisp  pThanksp

Negative 348 pBefore I have started to do webprogramming I had thought it was easy.

Specifically, I asked them if you can really have concurrency issues that you need to solve or otherwise you are at danger of your data becoming inconsistent and they were like hmm, never thought of that. That made me a bit afraid of my sanity and not even some exhausting web search have persuasively answered the question.p  pHence, here I am to make sure that rails of my mind do not lead to a very white polstered roomp  p1 supposing LAMP framework, is it possible for two php scripts run by apache to overlap in execution in any possible mannerp  p2 is it possible for the same script to be run more than once at the same time with its instances overlapping in any possible mannerp  p3 was the LAMP choice important or does the same thing holds for like any webdevelopment environment used todayp  p4 If the concurrency really can be a problem and i am not just making things up, is there any theory that would help me to wrap my head around it and solve these problems like this hey look, there is a possible concurrency issue and after a while hey, this is a classic example of X, which can be solved this way.p  p5 why programmers tend to look at web development as not being kosher while thinking they could do it easily no need to answer this but that fact pisses me off now while I know it used to be the same with mep  pI know, this is probably multisuckygeneral question from the stackoverflows point of view but I have nobody really experienced around me that could help.p

I was adding a view to my mvc project when i noticed that when mentioning the model for the view lots of classes appear to wich i have no reference in a direct way.

Negative 348 pI am working on a restaurant website.  The design calls for the typical dotted line infill between a menu item and the price.  I have been scouring the net and messing with it for an hour or so now and cant seem to find any good ways to do this with only CSS.

Negative 348 pI need to iterate through a potentially VERY large directory arbitrarily large. From what I understand, the regular codeglob.globcode function stores a list of emallem the matching filenames in memory, but the codeglob.iglobcode function uses an iterator.

Negative 348 pIm trying to set up a barcode scanner object that will capture anything input from the scanner itself. The barcode scanner is recognized as a standard input stdin and therefore whenever I scan a barcode, I get standard input text. There will also be a keyboard attached to the system, which is another standard input. In order to differentiate between a barcode scan input and keyboard input, I will be using a prefix for any barcode information. In other words, if my barcodes will be 16 characters in length total, the first 4 would a predetermined character stringkey to indicate that the following 12 characters are barcode inputs. This is pretty standard from what Ive read. p  pNow most examples Ive seen will recognize the barcode input by capturing the character input event in a GUI application. This event callback method then builds a buffer to check for the 4 character prefix and redirects barcode input as necessary. The event callback method also will skip any character input events that are not barcode related and allow them to interact with the GUI as a standard input normally would type into a text box or what have you. p  pI want to do this same thing except without using a GUI application. I want my barcode scanner object to be independent of the GUI application. Ideally I would have a callback method, within the barcode scanner object, that stdin would call every time a character is input. From there I would grab any barcode input by checking for the 4 character prefix and would pass along any characters not apart of the barcode input. So in other words, Id like stdin to pipe through my barcode scanner callback method, and then have my barcode scanner call back method be able to pipe non barcode characters back out as a standard input as though nothing had happened still standard input that would go to a text box or something. p  pIs this possible without a while loop constantly monitoring stdin Even if I had a while loop monitoring stdin, how would I pump characters back out as stdin if they werent barcode input I looked into using pyusb to take over the barcode scanners USB interface, but this requires root privileges to interact with the hardware not an option for my project. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have not been able to find an example of this yet. p  pEdit This project will be run in CentOS or some flavor of Linux.p

Negative 348 pFirst of all this question will be kind of long but in order to explain my problem in full i feel that i have to give you alot of information on my project so please bear with mep  pI am working for a company that uses charts alot so to avoid the trouble of always have to create charts from scats i have decided to create a new java project and create a package that me and my coworkers can use to create these charts. You could call them Generic.p  pSo this project uses a builder pattern and alot of interfaces and abstract classes. The idea is that that the client developer uses these interfaces, patterns and classes and override the methods to fit the flow. The only thing that would remain for the client developer would be to fill these methods and create to UI him self adn the publish the program.p  pThe program is shaping up nicely and i have created alot of features that i am very proud of since im a student i thought that i have planned the whole process well and nice but i ran into a few problemsp  pFirst of all let me show you the classes and explain the dataflow il do this as short as possiblep  pFirst off is the GUI This is a class that the user will always have to create him self but he can use the build in package to create his chart by using the following codep  precodeChartBuilder cb  new LineChartBuilder                   Director d  new Director d.buildTypeOnecb, Hello, PeriodSelection.HOUR, codepre  pWith this the director is now ready to build a chart.p  pThe codePeroidSelection.Hourcode is an enum that sets a standard time in this case it sets the charts category axis to our opening ours and therefore data that is collected know that it has to get data on an hourly basis from 8.00  19.00 in this case The reason why this is an Enum is that these type of periods are kinda final only thing that can change is our opening days and hours which we will then be able to change quite easily here is a preview of the codePeriodSelection enumcodep  precode    public enum PeriodSelection     HOURnew String[]800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900,     MONTHnew String[]Jan, Feb, Marts, April, Maj, Juni, Juli, Agu, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec,     DAYSnew String[]Mandag, Tirsdag, Onsdag,Torsdag,Fredag,Lrdag,Sndag      private String[] timeIntervals     private PeriodSelectionString[] timeIntervals         this.timeIntervals  timeIntervals          public String[] getTimeIntervals         return timeIntervals       codepre  pGoing into the Director the director is now ready to build the chart but first it has to collect data from the databasep  precode    public void buildTypeOneChartBuilder builder, String title, PeriodSelection selection, String queueName     try          builder.setObjectListstat.getDataqueueName, start, end      catch DopeDBException e           TODO Autogenerated catch block         e.printStackTrace           builder.selection  selection     builder.initiatetitle     builder.createSeries     builder.createSymbol      builder.createTable  codepre  pas you can see the builder is build in a certain way this is because the chart consists of both a table and a chart and those two has to be linked together, i wont go into much detail on the chart because it has no relevence to my question.p  pNow the stat class as showed in the first line of the codebuildTypeOnecode method extends and abstract class called codestatisticPatterncode that looks like thisp  precodepublic abstract class StatisticPattern    protected ArrayListltObjectInterfacegt cq  new ArrayListltgt protected ObjectInterface contact protected ProviderInterface p          link Constructor   public StatisticPattern     try          p  new Provider      catch DopeDBException e           TODO Autogenerated catch block         e.printStackTrace             param name   param start   param end   return   throws SQLException   throws DopeDBException   protected ArrayListltObjectInterfacegt getDataString name, DateTime start, DateTime end throws SQLException, DopeDBException     return cq        param contact2   protected void processSingleQueueDataObjectInterface contact2         param queueName   throws SQLException   protected void obtainNewDataString queueName throws SQLException           param name   param start   param end   return   protected boolean doIhaveItString name, DateTime start, DateTime end      return false        param start   param end   return   protected boolean checkDatasDateTime start, DateTime end      return start.toDateMidnight.isEqualend.toDateMidnight        param start   param end   return   protected Integer daysBetweenDateTime start, DateTime end      return  end.dayOfYear.getstart.dayOfYear.get   codepre  pAs stated eailer the purpose of this class is that our developers will extend the class and override the methods so that the director can find these methods and use them how they choose to implement and fill the methods is different from program to program.p  pIn this program the statistic class looks like thisp  precodepublic class Statistics extends StatisticPattern  private DateTime start private DateTime end       This class checks whether the program has already collected the data   Override   public ArrayListltObjectInterfacegt getDataString name, DateTime start, DateTime end throws DopeDBException     if this.start.equalsstart ampamp this.end.equalsend          if name.equalsIgnoreCaseAll              return cq         else if doIhaveItname, start, end              return cq              else          try              obtainNewDataname          catch SQLException e              e.printStackTrace                   return cq  Override protected void obtainNewDataString queueName throws SQLException      setDatesstart, end     this.cq  p.obtainDatastart, end, queueName   codepre  pAs you can see i have created my own implementation of the codegetDatacode method this method calls the codeobtainNewDatacode method that then obtains data from p which our provider class  also known as the connection to the database.p  pThe provider class as you might have guessed also implements and interface where there is only one method in the codeobtainDatacode methodp  precodepublic interface ProviderInterface   public ArrayListltObjectInterfacegt obtainDataDateTime start, DateTime end, String name throws SQLException codepre  pp  pAgain the developer has to implement this method but can fill it as he likes. The most important thing here is that the return type is an ArrayList of the type ObjectInterfacep  precodepublic interface ObjectInterface   HashMapltString, Integergt data  new HashMapltString, Integergt String type    public String getType public void addDataString key, Integer value public Integer getDataObject key codepre  pp  pBasicly it has to implement a hashmap that contains all the data that the chart should be filled with. This data will be added when the object is created and then added to the list in the provider, this list  will then be returned and the Director will set that to the chartbuilders list of data that will then fill the charts.p  pin this case the final object that has to fill the charts looks like thisp  precodepublic class ContactQueue implements ObjectInterface       private HashMapltString, Integergt data  new HashMapltString, Integergt     private String type     public ContactQueueString type         this.type  type          public String getType         return type          public void addDataString key, Integer value         if data.containsKeykey              Integer i  data.getkey             data.putkey, valuei         else              data.putkey, value                    public Integer getDataObject key         return data.getkey          public String toString         return type       codepre  pNow to the questionp  pAll of this works perfectly when there is only 1 type of data to be collected. But the program that i am currently working on has to get data from 5 different tables all of which has to be added on to each of their chart my problem is how would i design it so that it picks database table and returns a list for that specefic tablep  pI have already tried with the following codep  precode        if name.equalsIgnoreCaseBesvarelse          return besvarelse25start, end     else if name.equalsIgnoreCaseintern          return internstart, end     else if name.equalsIgnoreCasebesvarelseProcent          return besvarelseProcentstart,end     else if name.equalsIgnoreCaseEmaildata          return emaildatastart, end     else if name.equalsIgnoreCaseEmailHnd          return emailhaandstart, end     else if name.equalsIgnoreCaseEmailAntal          return emailantalstart, end          else if name.equalsIgnoreCaseHenvendelser          return henvendelserstart, end      codepre  pHowever that seems kinda redudant and well ugly to say the least.p  pi have thought about creating an Enum again that the client developer had to change each time he wanted to create a new program but i am unsure that this is the right way to do itp  pAlso i would love to hear what you think about the overall project have i nailed it or failed itp  pThank you for reading and i will be looking forward to read your responsesp

I found a couple of tutorials and a few examples as well. Somehow I just get confused about the whole architecture I have to use. Usually youd define all your routes within your server.js with express. So you get a full control of your routes on the server side. Now linking up backbone you have to define routes again This seems to be a model aspect but for me it seems like doublework which I somehow dislike.  So did I just got confused and things work completely differently Maybe someone has a link to a good tutorial or example where its made more clear.p

Negative 348 pWe are trying to query App Engine datastore for some general stats using NDB.

Meaning this structure has to be visually represented, and Id rather not make a whole complex of ArrayList unless absolutely neccessary since each JPanels have a ZOrder of component, and a getParent method.p  pThis structure is onedimenisonal, meaning that the parent has an onedimensional array and when I say array, its purely descriptive, I dont mean ArrayList or anything similar of its children. Each individual element has an index which represents its location inon its parent. Number of elements in a page, and pages in a chapter is inconsistent.p  pIts easy to get the childs index within its parent, but what about its grandparentsp  pSince the elements can be and usually are numbered, having a one numbered list per chapter, Id have to know the index of element in the Chapter, so I can adjust the numbers when a new element is added to the list it doesnt have to be added in the end.p  pThis can be solved in two ways that I know of, that isp  ol lipHave an ArrayList in each chapter that keeps all the elements. This would require me that, everytime I add a new element to any page, to add it to the chapter array too. To accomplish that Id have to go trough all the previous pages, add up all the elements on them and add index of the new element on the present page to that number, the result being the index of the new element in the chapter, and therfore, in the array. And do that each time I add a new element.pli lipRecreate the arrayList each time I need to get the order of elements in the chapter. Which again means going trought each page and adding each element one after another until I reach the end of chapter. And Id need it each time a new element is added.pli ol  pSo the question is, which of this two methods is better more efficient memory or processor time wise Which is more in the spirit of Java and programming altogether Is there a third option that I am unaware ofp  pChapter examplep  precodePage one  1. something 2. more something 3. nothing . . . 16. still nothing   Page two  17. maybe something 18. nope, still nothing . . . 21. giberish  etc. codepre  pThe question is Which way of doing it is better If you have a better idea, you can tell me, but I want to know which way of the above two is better non the less.p

So I basically want to use something likep  precodemyFavoriteAccounts  [100,200,300,400,500] codepre  pand then go through the entirety of the spreadsheet, printing any instance where one of my favorite accounts appears, as well as the case ID and the category. p  pIve been able to find the accounts that appear in both listsp  precodematch  setmyFavoriteAccounts amp setspreadsheetAccountsColumn codepre  pBut I dont know how to iterate through the spreadsheet and catch each time one of those accounts appeared emas well asem the category and case ID.p  pId like to be able to determine, for instance, that account 100 called in on two separate occasions about Shoes for case 50 and then again for Socks and case 70. p

Negative 348 pThis is a question on homework from CS2400 MSU Denverp  pHello,p  pI have a program that reads keys from the user until they have either entered a non HEX character or entered a max of 8 HEX characters. As keys are entered I maintain a sum of hex values being entered by the user by multiplying the sum register by 16 and adding the new hex value. p  pThis part is all fine and dandy, no help needed. I am having trouble taking this final result, in HEX, and converting it to DEC.

Negative 348 pIve got a Django backend that is using Tastypie to generate its RESTful API. The endpoint of this API does not sit at the toplevel of the domain rather, it exists in a subfolder location through the use of WSGIScriptAlias. Most, of the time, this works fine. But Ive discovered that when one of my resources has a ToManyField relationship, Tastypie throws an error. Here is some of my relevant code. The WSGIScriptAlias linep  precodeWSGIScriptAlias englishrubric varwebappsdjangorubricapachedjango.wsgi codepre  pSnippet from the resource that has problemsp  precodeclass TraitResourceModelResource     criteria  fields.ToManyFieldrubric.rubric.api.CriterionResource, criteria, relatednametrait, full  True      class Meta          queryset  Trait.objects.all          authenticationSessionAuthentication          listallowedmethods[get]     alwaysreturndataTrue  class CriterionResourceModelResource      class Meta         queryset  Criterion.objects.all         authenticationSessionAuthentication         listallowedmethods[get]     alwaysreturndataTrue codepre  pMy urls.pyp  precodev1api  Apiapinamev1 v1api.registerTraitResource v1api.registerCriterionResource  urlpatterns  patterns,       rlogin, djangocas.views.login,     rlogout, djangocas.views.logout,     rapi, includev1api.urls  codepre  pSnippet from the error messagep  precode errormessage path uenglishrubricapiv1rubric, tried [[ltRegexURLPattern None logingt], [ltRegexURLPattern None logoutgt], [ltRegexURLResolver [ltRegexURLPattern apiv1toplevel Pltapinamegtv1gt, ltRegexURLResolver [ltRegexURLPattern apidispatchlist ... codepre  pit goes on from there to list all of the URLs it has tried and failed to find a match for.p  pSo if I understand correctly, what is happening is that, because of my WSGIScriptAlias, the related objects are reporting their full path as the resource URI, but then when tastypie goes to get the related objects to return with the one Ive called, they arent matching anything in urls.py because it only needs the url patterns relative to the WSGI app mount point. Ive verified this is the case by temporarily modifying the WSGIScriptAlias so the API sits at the root  and then it all works fine. So what do I need to do in order to keep it with the subfolder URL pattern Ive played around a bit with both overriding prependurls and getresourceuri, but am not really getting how those functions are used in a resource class and so Im not sure if thats the right strategy for me. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 348 pI am writing a program and I need to initialize a message buffer which will hold text. I am able to make it work, however I am writing below various ways used to initialize the strings in C and I want to understand the difference. Also, which is the most appropriate method for initializing a wchartchar stringp  pstrongMethod Istrongp  precodewchart message[100] codepre  pbased on my understanding, this will allocate a memory space of 200 bytes I think size of wchart is 2 bytes on Windows OS. This memory allocation is static and it will be allocated inside the .data section of the executable at the time of compiling.p  pmessage is also a memory address itself that points to the first character of the string.p  pThis method of initializing a string works good for me.p  pstrongMethod IIstrongp  precodewchart message messagewchart  mallocsizeofwchart  100 codepre  pThis method will first initialize the variable message as a pointer to wchart. It is an array of wide characters.p  pnext, it will dynamically allocate memory for this string. I think I have written the syntax for it correctly.p  pWhen I use this method in my program, it does not read the text after the space in a string.p  precodeExample text This is a message codepre  pIt will read only This into the variable message and no text after that.p  pstrongMethod IIIstrongp  precodewchart message[100] codepre  pThis will define message as an array of 100 wide characters and a pointer to wchart. This method of initializing message works good. However, I am not sure if it is the right way. Because message in itself is pointing to the first character in the string. So, initializing it with the size, is it correctp  pI wanted to understand it in more depth, the correct way of initializing a string. This same concept can be extended to a string of characters as well.p  pThanks.p

Negative 348 pIm trying to implement a secure broadcast receiver which only receives broadcasts from a specific app. This is because I want to make a plugin to my app which triggers actions via broadcasts. As this actions are partly sensible it would be nice to check if the sender is really my application. As far as I have seen its impossible to check the sender package Would it be secure to define a custom permission for that If yes, how can I do this What other possibilities are there to achieve thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 348 pI know that JPanel is, by default, automatically doublebuffered. However, I have a particularly timeintensive painting operation in my panel, but the panel only needs to be repainted when the underlying data changes, which is rare. Therefore, Id like to reuse the JPanel buffer instead of having it clear after every call to coderepaintcode.p  pIve manually implemented a dirty flag on my JPanel subclass, but I have no idea how to cancel a paint operation once its been started. I cant avoid the call to repaint in the first place, since my panel is inside a JScrollPane, which is being repainted every time its resized which emdoesem happen frequently, which causes my custom panel to be repainted.p  pIs there any way to do this without manually buffering the panel If not, whats the recommended method for implementing a manual buffer in conjunction with a JPanelp

Negative 348 pI have an MVC that serves a form to a view. Im pondering the best approach to serving form content, that is form elements such as labels and form inputs such as selects. It is possible that the form elements will change often and will have many different versions spanning several pages.p  pI have thought about three approaches, each unsatisfactory to me.p  ul liEach version of the form will be fully written in html and saved as a discreet view.li ul  pstrongProsstrong If I need a particular set of elements, I can call a view with one line of code from my controller.p  pstrongConsstrong I will end up with dozens upon dozens of views.p  ul liShift the load to my controller, and pass an array of element names to my view codearrayselect gt arraylabel gt element 1, class gt big, select, input, inputcode, which will take the array and parse it into the markup as form elements. li ul  pstrongProsstrong Allows me to have just one view, and I can specify the set of form elements I want loaded into the view at the controller level.p  pstrongConsstrong My controller will go from several lines of code to several hundred lines of array definitions pretty quick.p  ul liSerialize sets of elements and tuck them away into a database to be called whenever.li ul  pstrongProsstrong Several lines of code at my controller and one view file.p  pstrongConsstrong Making changes to any one set of form elements becomes a real pain. Anytime I have to include a new set or make changes, I have to access the database and unserialize and serialize.p  pSo for templating different versions of the same form, and also allowing interchangeability of form elements, what is the approach do you guys suggestp

Negative 348 pDoes anyone know how to properly test live android in app purchases in titanium debug modep  pPreviously, I was successfully able to test live inapp purchases and create real transactions when debugging from Titanium Studio. That was because previously, I had incorrectly created my Google Play store listing using the development .apk as per a hrefhttpdeveloper.appcelerator.comquestion123704whatkeystoredoestitaniumstudiousetobuildandroidappduringdevelopment relnofollowhttpdeveloper.appcelerator.comquestion123704whatkeystoredoestitaniumstudiousetobuildandroidappduringdevelopmentap  pand therefore, Google play had associated my devkeystore with my inapp purchase codes.p  pHowever, when I then tried to build and upload my production release using a generated keypaircertificate as per wiki.appcelerator.orgdisplayguidesDistributingAndroidappsp  pthe Google Play store then correctly rejected my production candidate complaining that my APK had been signed with a different certificate to the one that was used in the original uploadp  precodeYou uploaded an APK that is signed with a different certificate to your previous APKs.  You must use the same certificate. Your existing APKs are signed with the certificates  with fingerprints [ SHA1 ...9D479F ] and the certificates used to sign the APK  you uploaded have fingerprints [ SHA1 ...5DE24E ] codepre  pAs such, I had to delete my google play store listing and recreate it from scratch using the signed APK as described by the appcelerator guide referenced above.p  pThis has now resulted in my inapp purchases becoming associated with the signed APK which means that now when I am testing a development build of the app and attempt to make an inapp purchase, I am greeted withp  precodeThis version of the application is not configured for billing through Google Play codepre  pIt is not a timing issue I have waited 24 hours as suggested by stackoverflow.comquestions11068686thisversionoftheapplicationisnotconfiguredforbillingthroughgoogleplap  pIt is occurring because the devkeystore in my development build doesnt match the certificate associated with the inapp purchase codes.p  pI imagine I might be able to get around this if Titanium studio allowed me to specify my apps certificate certificate when debugging as per a hrefhttpjira.appcelerator.orgbrowseTISTUD1214 relnofollowhttpjira.appcelerator.orgbrowseTISTUD1214ap  pIn the interim, a testing workaround to debug purchases is that I have created an additional and separate test duplicate google play application with identical in app purchases and associated it with my development .apk instead of my signed apk. During testing, I then just need to changep  precoderequireti.inappbilling.setPublicKey... codepre  pto point to the test project instead of the real one. Then, when im comfortable with the payments, I will build using the real key.p  pThis is a really substandard workaround and im hoping someone has a better way of doing things.p

Negative 348 pive a big project in my mind to create a great number of content nodes i.e. videotutorials, put them in the cloud and then have a website and a mobile app from which registered users can watch what they already purchased for example they can stream purchased videotutorials or buy new content. It seems like classic cms plugins are only predisposed to sell physical objects or downloads, i havent found something ready to do what i need. I know i could easily do this with premium subscriptions and user roles, but id really like the possibility for the user to buy individual products for example only the videotutorials he needs. Can you suggest me anything that could help me realizing this Thank you Im familiar with drupaljoomlaphpjsp

Negative 348 pI tried searching around, but couldnt come up with much on the topic of this.p  pIs there an API or code within various Security APIs that would allow some sort of passcode locking mechanism to enable whenever a device is connected by Bluetooth, etc and disable whenever said device is paired with the phone  An interesting concept I had thought up earlier today but cant seem to determine a method available for this.p  pThe concept is pretty much this if the phone is close enough to be connected over Bluetooth to the device would be something like a smartwatch or other wearable computing then the phone is on you and passcode entry can be disabled.  However, when the device is not found by the iPhone, there is a physical distance between the two devices and the phone should lock up and not allow entry.  This could even be some form of superficial lock mechanism on some apps which exists already that could activate based on this proximity awareness.  This method is meant to failsafe by being a lock first, then check mentality that is paired to a specific address of the wearable computing.  This could, in theory, be hacked, yes, but for general usage allows a user to have a nomaintenance method that can save some passcode entries from time to time should one find it annoying, but still want its security potential.  p  pAgain, this idea is based on the assumption that said device connecting to your iPhone that the phone itself is searching for is physically latched to you somehow.p  pThanks and I appreciate any sort of input or direction.p

Negative 348 pI have a class that acts as a wrapper around AVPlayer, and one of the functions it serves is to post notifications every 1 and 10 seconds during playback ie make codeaddPeriodicTimeObserverForIntervalcode more convenient in the general case.p  pPreviously, the object I was sending with this notification was the player wrapper itself ie ABPlayer.sharedPlayer. Today I had the need to allow for some objects to only receive notifications about a specific media items playback. This can be accomplished by sending code[[someAVURLAsset URL] absoluteString]code as the notification object when the asset in the codeAVPlayercode is an codeAVURLAssetcode, of course.p  pThe prompted the question is it appropriate for a single notification to, in different situations, post with different emtypesem of objects I understand the value in sending specific objects or sending codenilcode catchall, but I dont recall seeing a situation where an alternative type of object could be sent. In my case, though, it seems to make sense.p  pI could simply send two distinct notifications, but since these are always only ever being sent to notify observers of a single event, and they are always being sent from the same place in code, they simply feel like a single notification.p  pI realize what I have is possible and working, but Im curious if theres a compelling reason to avoid this pattern.p

And for code based solutions i am wondering is this the best method you can use.p  pI saw some commets which says if you have dynamic URL then IIS method might give you error for some URL with data.p  pSecond is pros and cons of these two methods So other can use one of those method according their needsp  phere are some of the answer i got from webp  pa hrefhttpraoulpop.com20070807automaticredirectfromhttptohttps relnofollowhttpraoulpop.com20070807automaticredirectfromhttptohttpsap  pThis is IIS method a hrefhttpwww.sslshopper.comiis7redirecthttptohttps.html relnofollowhttpwww.sslshopper.comiis7redirecthttptohttps.htmlap  pand i can go on with these solutions.

Negative 348 pIm working with an ancient preXML markup that uses codes of the form x, where x may be an alphabetic character or a symbol on the keyboard, such as codecode semicolon, codecode question mark, or codeltcode strikerightstrike left angle bracket, aka strikegreaterthanstrike lessthan. [Note after editing the confusion manifested in the question as originally phrased goes to the heart of the problem. See my comment to the accepted answer. RS]p  pSo Ive modified a copy of XML.tmLanguage syntax definition file in my User folder to identify the eleven different categories that these codes represent, so I can easily see them in the large text files which also contain XML markup Im working with.p  pFor all the symbols except codeltcode Im able to escape the symbol by preceding it with a backslash. But in the Boost regex engine that ST2 uses, codeltcode is how you indicate that you want to match only at the start of a word. Consequently Ive been unable to get this code to be properly recognized and highlighted.p  pIve looked everywhere for how to escape the codeltcode symbol in this circumstance. Ive tried preceding it with 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 backslashes and I also tried using the hexadecimal escape code codex3009code. [Note this is the code for greaterthan instead of lessthan.]p  pAll in vain. A few alternatives didnt generate an error message but also didnt highlight the code.p  pBecause the codes Im working with need to be colored differently, I cant use a generic symbol in lieu of codeltcode, and I cant specify it either.

Well, of course it can but than you have to approach the fraction of each color and I dont like that solution. I tried decomposing the color into its r, g, b channels but that did not work. The reason is quite obvious by hindsight. Suppose you need a gradient between FF0000 and 0000FF. Youll have a red color transforming from FF00 and a blue from 00FF. However, there is no green 00FF00 which is clearly present in a rainbow gradient.p  pWhat I need is a gradient function that I can give two colors and a fraction and it generates a color. Can anyone point me to an article, algorithm or even codep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pNGLNs answer is the right answer for this question. Both he and Warren wondered what to do when a a color is not a embrightem color a color containing a 0, a FF and a value. I tried several angles updownscaling and HSL interpolation. I finally settled down for the last one as being the most simple. p  pBasically you have two colors codefromcode and codetocode. Use RGBtoHSL to extract the HSL parameters from each color codeRGBtoHSL colfrom, hf, sf, lfcode. Next compute the hue, saturation and luminance between both colors and reconstruct a new color. This is what NGLN mentions in his update about hue, but if you generalise this principle you have a rainbow between any color.p  precodefunction TColorDialog.interpolatehsl colfrom, colto TAlphaColor fraction double TAlphaColor   var af, at, ad uInt8       hf, ht, hd single       sf, st, sd single       lf, lt, ld single   begin    Get each rgb color channel      af  GetAValue colfrom      at  GetAValue colto      RGBtoHSL colfrom, hf, sf, lf      RGBtoHSL colto,   ht, st, lt     Compute differences      ad  af  Round fraction  at  af      hd  hf  fraction  ht  hf      sd  sf  fraction  st  sf      ld  lf  fraction  lt  lf       Result  MakeColor HSLtoRGB hd, sd, ld, ad   end  interpolatehsl  codepre  pThis gives a rainbow for all colors possible. I apply the same interpolation for the opacity, hence the use of codeMakeColorcode to fumble the interpolated alpha channel into the color.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commCltv.png altenter image description herep

Negative 348 pI have a WPF program, using the MVVM architecture, that accesses a SQL Server through WCF. I have got it to the point where it needs to be integration tested, i.e. the program is working correctly, and unit tests have all passed. p  pI have found very little information on exactly how to do integration testing, and have never done it in the past. The problem I am facing is that all my View Models which need access to the WCF service have a parameter  on their constructors for codeIDataServicecode which is injected into the constructor by my View Model Locator. p  pHere is a sample of the service where codeCdaServicecode refers to my development databasep  precodepublic class DataService  CdaServiceManager.IDataService      public void SelectActionltCdaServiceManager.CdaService.DatabaseTablegt callback, CdaServiceManager.CdaService.DatabaseTable thisTable              using CdaService.Service1Client webService  new CdaService.Service1Client                      var item  webService.SelectthisTable             callbackitem                codepre  pI have created an exact replica of my development environment on a seperate server, database and WCF service are exactly the same. During integration tests the database is cleared and reset to start with fresh data.p  pIn my test, I have a different Service Reference called codeCdaServicecode that points to the test server WCF. When I call my view mdoel constructor, I obviously cannot send my development version of codeIDataServicecode since it is pointing to the real server. p  pI see one option of creating my own implementation of codeIDataServicecode for the test environment, but then any time the production environment service changes I will have to make sure to change the test environment service. Seems sloppy.p  pIs there a better way to do this. Ideally I would be able to send the DataService the WCF reference I would like it to use, but I cant seem to wrap my head around it. Any other suggestions or ideas would be appreciated. p

Negative 348 pI have a simple problem where I think I am missing something obvious but could not find anything to understand the behavior. I have a table and then a p tag and a div tag. All the samelevel tags are default positioned. Only the innerdiv in the last div has an absolute position. I thought that an absolute position in an innerdiv would be absolutely positioned relative to ITS outer div idouter.  p  pTherefore, I would expect the display to consist of, in vertical order, the table, Text1 and finally Text2. That is not what is happening. Table is displayed as expected, Text 1 is also displayed after table as expected. However, Text 2 is displayed on top of the table because it takes absolute position from the body tag or whatever is the outermost tag. Why How to get Text2 to position after Text1.

Negative 348 pI asked a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19828632isitpossibletousefirebasewithawindows8appquestion earliera about if it was possible to use Firebase in a Windows 8WinJS app. MichaelLehenbauer told me that I just needed to add the following line to my code in order to fix a bug in firebase.jsp  precodeFirebase.INTERNAL.forceWebSockets codepre  pThis worked great and allowed me to read and write to my Firebase. However, now I am trying to get auth working in Windows 8 and running into many issues. I am trying to use the Facebook login but when I call codeauth.loginfacebookcode, my app loses focus and a new tab in the modern Internet Explorer app not the desktop app is opened with the typical Facebook login prompt. If I put in my credentials and hit login, nothing happens. I need to go back to my app but then it fires up a new IE tab and the process starts again. Instead of opening a new IE tab, Firebase should internally be opening an inapp dialog like seen in the top image a hrefhttpwww.csharpcorner.comUploadFile99bb20createloginscreeninmetrostyleapplication relnofollowherea.p  pSo, since I couldnt get the Firebase Facebook login working in WinJS, I tried doing the Facebook login myself and then create Firebase users using the emailpassword auth.

Negative 348 pI am learning Windows Store App development. I am an iOS developer with a lot of Cocoa Touch experience, but no Microsoft technology experience, so everything from the language to the tools is new to me.p  pI cant figure out what the emrightem way to save complex user data is in Windows Store Apps. The way I have always handled saving user data in iOS is by having a class or series of classes that represent my Apps data model that I serialize and deserialize with NSCoder  encodeWithCoder  decodeWithCoder for the purpose of saving. I assumed thats what Id do on Windows Store apps, but after hours of research and trial and error mostly error Im thinking thats not how things are done in this world.p  pHeres my use case Im writing a simple image processing  collage app that allows users to import photos, arrange and process them, and then save or share the output. My data model is a class that manages an array of Images. The properties of the Images reflect their positions, transformations, etc. p  pTo allow my users to save and load their creations I figured I would simply serialize and deserialize my data model class. However, it seems that Windows Store apps only have XMLSerializer, and it is extremely limited. You cant serialize images, never mind arrays of images. On top of that it seems to require lots of plumbing code that I cant find examples of to even work for custom classes. You could serialize a string with it, but anything more complex seems out of the picture.p  pSo, Windows developers, what is the right way to do this Should I copy all of the files for a given collage, put them in a directory, save a manifest of what files are displayed where, compress that, and call that my file That seems like a emlotem of work. Have I been remiss in my research Is there a simple way to binaryserialize my data model like I could on iOSp  pThanks emvery muchem for help p

Negative 348 pIn my Qt Application Im facing the following scenario When a specific event is raised I show a modeless codeQDialogcode which asks the user for a confirmation. The Dialog is showed using codeshowcode function from a codeQMainWindowcode. Anytime the event is raised and no other modal codeQDialogcode are shown, the user is able to click the confirmation button. Unfortunately if a modal codeQDialogcode is visible when the event is raised, the modeless codeQDialogcode is unaccessible. This means that the user cannot click the confirmation button. The following code is a simplified version that causes the same problem In this example the codeQMainWindowcode contains a button, when the button is clicked a modal codeQDialogcode is shown using the codeexeccode function in the meanwhile a codeQTimercode has been started. Anytime I close the modal codeQDialogcode before the codeQTimercode is elapsed the modeless dialog is accesible. If I wait until the modeless dialog is shown without closing the modal one, the modeless dialog is inaccessible I need to close the modal one first.p  pMainWindows codep  precodeinclude mainwindow.h include uimainwindow.h  MainWindowMainWindowQWidget parent      QMainWindowparent,     uinew UiMainWindow      uigtsetupUithis     mpModeless  new DialogModalthis     connectampmqTimer,SIGNALtimeout,this,SLOTTimerElapsed    MainWindowMainWindow      delete mpModeless     delete ui    void MainWindowTimerElapsed      mqTimer.stop     mpModelessgtshow     mpModelessgtactivateWindow     mpModelessgtraise     mpModelessgtsetFocus   void MainWindowonpbStartTestclicked      mqTimer.start10000     DialogModal dthis     d.exec  codepre  pMainWindow Headerp  precodeifndef MAINWINDOWH define MAINWINDOWH  include ltQMainWindowgt include ltQTimergt include dialogmodal.h  namespace Ui  class MainWindow   class MainWindow  public QMainWindow      QOBJECT  public     explicit MainWindowQWidget parent  0     MainWindow     QTimer mqTimer     DialogModal mpModeless private     UiMainWindow ui private slots     void TimerElapsed     void onpbStartTestclicked   endif  MAINWINDOWH codepre  pDialogModal Headerp  precodeifndef DIALOGMODALH define DIALOGMODALH  include ltQDialoggt  namespace Ui  class DialogModal   class DialogModal  public QDialog      QOBJECT  public     explicit DialogModalQWidget parent  0     DialogModal  private slots     void onpbExitclicked  private     UiDialogModal ui   endif  DIALOGMODALH codepre  pDialogModal sourcep  precodeinclude dialogmodal.h include uidialogmodal.h  DialogModalDialogModalQWidget parent      QDialogparent,     uinew UiDialogModal      uigtsetupUithis   DialogModalDialogModal      delete ui   void DialogModalonpbExitclicked      close  codepre  pIs there anyway to give focus to the modeless dialog even when one or more modal dialog are presentp

Negative 348 pfor a class project I decided to make a password generator using all of the printable characters in the asci table except the minus sign and then the program will try to crack it. The password characters are stored in an array and the attempts to crack it are stored in another array. The attempts are just randomized characters and then are compared against the entire password array. If all the characters in both arrays match the program is terminated...if not the loop continues. The problem with my program is that it takes way too long to match the arrays since the attempts are just randomized numbers. Could you help me optimize the code by developing a strategic way to check the password Even psuedocode helps.

Does anyone know why I post below the method which does the same Query.p  precodePersistenceManager pm  PMF.get.getPersistenceManager Query q  pm.newQuerySELECT FROM   CoursePO.class.getName   ORDER BY createdDate DESC LIMIT 4 ListltCoursePOgt results  ListltCoursePOgtq.execute LOGGER.warningSize   results.size This size is greather than 4  pm.close return results codepre  pThank you so much in advancep  p[EDIT] I would like to know, how downVote this question . Do you think is a stupid question Do you think im wrong Try it before judgep  p[ADDED INFO] The result content is the same as the simple Query q  pm.newQueryCoursePO.class So, all the elements inside the Entity. The only different thing is that the clause ORDER BY DESC works perfectly, but not for LIMIT 4.p  p[EDIT]p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcEUaL.png altGQL Syntax from Google App Enginep

Negative 348 pBoost Test Library is a very useful unit test framework. However, one thing I feel uncomfortable is that during the unit test if errors happen it will inform the user but not the program itself. Let me make my point clear by using BOOSTCHECK as an examplep  precodei3 j4 BOOSTCHECKij codepre  pThe above test case will fail. So, checking the details to find why this test fails will be very interesting. In this case, printing some variables or performing more complicated operations such as writing a file to the disk in the program will be necessary if it knows that the unit test fails. However, BOOSTCHECK will not return a value to denote the test is successful or not. A perfect function should work like thisp  precode    i3     j4     ifEnhancedBOOSTCHECKij  failed                print some internal varaibles.          or write some data to a file in the disk       codepre  pSo my question is does BOOST Test Library support this functionality Thanks. p

I wanted it to be in a web page format so that it was platformindependent compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Negative 348 pOkay, we all know that it is not possible to use the XmlSerializer for classes without a parameterless constuctor as the deserializer will create the object and set all properties. However, by using Activator.CreateInstance one can instanciate classes without a parameterless constructor. For example we could instanciate the following classp  precodepublic class Foo      public Foostring bar  codepre  pThat class can easily be instanciated with the Activatorp  precodeActivator.CreateInstancetypeofFoo,some string codepre  pUnfortunantely Foo cannot be serialized using the XmlSerializer as it has no parameterless constructor. Why is there no way to use the XmlSerializer like thatp  precodenew XmlSerializertypeofFoo.Deserializestream,some string codepre  pOf course I could implement my own Serializer that simply will store the type and all properites amp fields of an object and then will use the Activator to instanciate the object and set the previously stores properties. The question is would that make sense I guess there must be a strong reason against because otherwise that would be implemented already, rightp

Negative 348 pC is not a managed language, and its been a while since I have used an unmanaged language.  I need to create a block of code which searches through a character array, and replaces all instances of 2 with Ba.  This is quite simple, except for the fact that now the resulting string will be larger than the original, so I need to account for this somehow, and I dont remember how to do this.  p  pHere is try number 4, using pointersp  precodeMove next 150 characters after replacing all 2 with Ba     numberread  readXYZFile, datatoreadWWW, sizeofdatatoreadWWW     int y  strlendatatoreadWWW should be 150.     int additionallength  y     i  0     whilei lt y        ifdatatoreadWWW[i]  2          additionallength Since we need to replace any 2 with Ba, we should add one character for the a.              i          And now use additionallength to create the new char array to be placed in WWW, called newstring     char newstring[additionallength]     int j  0     const char in  datatoreadWWW     char out  newstring     whilein        if in  2      out  B     out  a              else      out  in              in          out  0 codepre  pAnd Im still confusedstuck on this, Im getting garbage values written into the WWW file such as Q and such.  Not sure what that means, but it doesnt seem correct.p  pstrongEditstrong The program above seems to be working now.  The problem was, if anyone ever reads this post as a resource, that I was adding 1 to additionallength, but this was happening in every iteration, so every so many characters there was an extra empty, null space being put in to the file, which was incorrect.  Regardless, I think weve learned that is important to review pointers whenever working in C, as this is the easiest way to accomplish this.p

Negative 348 pThere is a dictionary with three keys Animals, Birds and Fish.p  pThe main dialog has two List views. The left view codeviewAcode displays the list of the keys mentioned above.  When one of its items is clicked the right view codeviewBcode displays the list of the species.p  pThe question is how to manage codeviewBcodes display... Lets say the user clicks Animals codelistBcode goes ahead and builds a brand new list of QListWidgetItem for every animal in a list. Then the user clicks Birds. What should I do with already built codeviewBcodes animal items Should I hide them hiding Animals items instead of deleting would allow me unhide them later when Animals is clicked again makes total sense if ListItems are heavy on graphics thumbs, icons and etc. If a list of animals is 1000 there will be a noticeable difference between rebuilding the ListItems from scratch and unhiding the ones that were build on a last click.br Another approach I see is to user codeviewB.clearcode every time codeviewAcodes item is clicked. So the codelistBcode items are rebuilt every time codelistAcode item is clicked. But as I have mentioned with a long list of items it could be really slow.

Negative 348 pI have been working on a SpriteKit game for a while now and I have an annoying problem that I cant get rid of. I dont want to tell too much about the game, but it is very simple. I generate some objects SKSpriteNodes each second that are falling down from the top of the screen using SpriteKits physics and the player is interacting with them.p  pMost of the time the game runs perfectly constant 60 FPS. The problem is that sometimes maybe once per minute or something like that, the game starts to lag a little bit for about 35 seconds still at 60 FPS and then it runs perfectly again note im running the game on an iPhone 5s. It seems to be because of the physics, because if I add a normal moveaction on an object, it runs very smoothly while the nodes affected by the physics are lagging.p  pI tried to remove some particles and effects that I have and I reuse my objects, but I cant remove the lag. I decided to create a very simple test project to see if the lag would be gone but it is still there.

Negative 348 pIve manipulated and tried a different way about going about something.

The combobox itself had a Value List in it and referenced that when clicking the drop down arrow. However Ive since changed that and bound it to a table that I created for something past this. Now when I go to the drop down I get those specific values that I did before only loaded from a table rather than a Value List. The problem is that when selecting the value it does not select.

Negative 348 pI have a set of C DLLs that have already been builttheyve gone through the process of setting the version numbers in AssemblyInfo.cs, theyve been formally built by our configuration management team, and theyve been archived off where they belong so we dont lose the built DLLs.p  pNow I have to take a collection of these DLLs and package them up into a couple umbrellas, and these umbrellas can have different versions.

Again, the DLLs are already built, so I cant add anything to AssemblyInfo.cs now.p  pIdeally, this would be another property that shows up on the DLLs Details tab, and it would be something that I can inject into a DLL using some tool, but Im not familiar with any Windows API calls that can addmodify these properties.p  pKeep in mind this is for internal releases of these DLLs so we can keep track of what we have installed ourselves during development the ones that will be packaged and released for real would be the pristine ones formally built and wont have any properties added into them.p  pEDIT Thirdparty tools will be difficult to use if it doesnt come with Windows or Visual Studio, then it would be strongly preferred if its something that can be written very quickly.p  pThanks.p

Negative 348 pThe setup was working a few days ago, but stopped when the host computer was used outside of the office on a different network. Initially we thought that the issue was related to the host or guests network being set as public, however we ensured that the network was set to private on both machines. Additionally, while vagrant was Waiting for machine to boot... we were able to open up a second shell and successfully start a remote WinRM session using EnterPSSession vagrant2012r2 Credential vagrant, so I am unsure why vagrant is unable to communicate with the guest when booting. What is even stranger is that from the debug logs it looks like vagrant uses WinRM to shutdown the guest machine, and does so successfully so Im confused as to why it is failing during vagrant up.We are using vagrant version 1.6.5 and VMWare Workstation 10.0.4 build2249910.

Negative 348 pI am studying for the Spring Core certification and I am finding some doubts related to the strongproxyingstrong notion.p  pSo on the study material I find the following quizp  pThere is a Java strongconfiguration classstrong that contains the following methodsp  precodeBean public AccountRepository accountRepository      return new JdbcAccountRepository    Bean public TransferService transferService1      TransferServiceImpl service  new TransferServiceImpl     service.setAccountRepositoryaccountRepository     return service   Bean public TransferService transferService2      return new TransferServiceImpl new JdbcAccountRepository   codepre  pAs you can see there are 2 different implementation of a strongtransferServicestrong respectively named as strongtransferService1strong and strongtransferService2strong that create and return a strongTransferServiceImplstrong object.p  pThe first one creatre a new strongTransferServiceImplstrong object and then call the strongsetAccountRepositorystrong method on it.p  pThe second one simply create a strongTransferServiceImplstrong passing a new strongJdbcAccountRepositorystrong object to its constructor.p  pIt ask to me Which is the best implementation brween the previous 2 methodsp  pAnd the answer provided is strongPrefer call to dedicated methodstrong. So I think that it say that the best way is the first implementation.p  pIt explain that strongAccountRepositorystrong bean is a strongsingletonstrong because it is the standard scope for the beans in Spring but that the strongJdbcAccountRepositorystrong could be called twice or more times for example in the previous code snippet it is called when are called the methods strongtransferService1strong and strongtransferService2strong and if so this would be a problem because strongAccountRepositorystrong have to be a strongsingletonstrong.p  pIs it true Or am I missing somethingp  pSo I gather that at startup time foreach configuration class annotated with strongConfigurationstrong is created a strongchild classstrong that extends my configuration class.p  pFor example if I have the following configuration classp  precodeConfiguration public class AppConfig      Bean public AccountRepository accountRepository  ...      Bean public TransferService transferService  ...   codepre  pit is automatically created the following class that extends my strongAppConfigstrongp  precodepublic class AppConfigEnhancerByCGLIB extends AppConfig      public AccountRepository accountRepository   ...      public TransferService transferService   ...      ...     ...     ...  codepre  pSo the strongchild classstrong is the entry point the method called are those definied in the child class and the pseudocode will be something like thisp  precodepublic class AppConfigEnhancerByCGLIB extends AppConfig       public AccountRepository accountRepository           if bean is in the applicationContext return bean          else call super.accountRepository and store bean in context           public TransferService transferService           if bean is in the applicationContext, return bean          else call super.transferService and store bean in context       codepre  pSo it appear pretty clear how Spring can handle the singleton problem strongit call the methods on a proxy class that extends the configuration class and if the requested bean exist into the applicationContext return this beans, else call the same method on the super class that create the new bean and put it into the application contextstrongp  pIs it the right meaning of the inheritance based on the proxy pattern or am I missing somethingp

Negative 348 pfirst I would like to let you know that I am not very experienced with C, and not experienced at all with SDL. Although I have studied documentation and examples for SDL I cant understand what I do wrong . Here is my casep  pstrongemDescription of Situationemstrong I have a written an application in VS Express 2013  using C that reads a custom bitmap file and does various things with it. Actually this custom bitmap contains many frames , so it is more like a custom animation file. In my main program, after loading the file I have a List of pixels, for each frame.  Since I need to preview the frames loaded I have a Picture Box on the application window. Until now I used the Drawing methods of C to update the preview Picture Box. I simply created a Rectangle for each pixel , filled it with the color it should show, and all worked. Since these animations started getting bigger, with many pixels and frames, this procedure is very heavy and slow. I decided to use SDLDotNet to make things better. I hope I made the right decision, since I am not an expert with graphics. For now I have two possible solutions  One is to ..somehow, not sure how... make SDl draw on the original preview picturebox of my application. Second is to let SDL create its own window and use that for preview. p  pstrongemDescription of Problememstrong I created a class in my project for all the SDL functionality. I use the following code to draw the preview windowp  pcodepublic void InitSdl                      Video.SetVideoMode800, 640, false, false, false, true             Surface sfc  Video.CreateRgbSurface200, 300             vidSfc Video.SetVideoMode200, 300, 32, false, true, false, true, false             background  new Surface200, 300, 32.ConvertvidSfc,true,false             Events.Quit  new EventHandlerltQuitEventArgsgtApplicationQuitEventHandler             Events.Tick  new EventHandlerltTickEventArgsgtApplicationTickEventHandler             Events.Runbr         codep  pwhere vidSfc is a surface in the same class and so is background. The aim is to fill backround with a backcolor, say black, then use primitive methodsor another way that I am still investigating to draw the pixels in the background surface and the ask SDL to draw the background inside the vidSfc. It seems to me from all the tutorials and examples, that it is always good to have a master surface for the final screen output, and other surfaces to do the processing and preparation of frames.p  pOnce the code above runs, I get a separate window which is drawn gray. I cant draw anything in this window, at least with all the ways I have tried. Here is some code that I used trying to redraw bacgkroundp  precodepublic void FillSfcSystem.Drawing.Color c              background.Fillc         background.Update         vidSfc.Blitbackground         vidSfc.Update      codepre  pNothing happens when I run this ... Regarding the Events.Tick and Events.Run , that are commented out, here is my excuse First, I dont need events at the moment other than Quit, which seems to work fine, with some calls I do on application Close. Second, when code hits codeEvents.Runcode it never comes out, so it never returns control to my main application that called the codeInitSdlcode. I assume this is because all of the examples and tutorials I studied refer to applications where SDL is the main program and controls everything, so I havent found some documentation or example to see how could SDL be used as a slave to draw under the control of my application, like System.Drawing in C does.p  pAny input on this will be appreciated, and remember I am new to all this, maybe some questions seem silly, but I am stuck.p  pThank youp  pAlexp

Listening for the codeUIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotificationcode notification doesnt work because its fired for all windows that are added including things like ad networksp  pBottom line, Ive been working on this all night and I cant seem to figure out how to determine if a video was opened in full screen with a WKWebView.

Negative 348 pIm using Android Studio 1.0.2 on Mac OS X 10.10.2. I can use Eclipse with adb with no problems on my system. However, Android Studio has problems connecting to adb. The first run it works. It seems that after a certain amount of time 20  30 secs adb quits unexpectedly. Then I get the message ADB not respoding in Android Studio. Manually killing and starting adb from a terminal sometimes fixes the problem but usually makes my device Samsung Galaxy S5 invisible to adb. There is only one adb on my system version 1.0.32 installed.p  pDoing an lsof i 5037 shows a list of 9 connections from Android Studio, all from localhost, all CLOSEWAIT but one which is ESTABLISHED.

Restarting it sometimes allows me to continue working, sometimes it changes nothing.p  pUnplugging and plugging back in my device fixes the device visibility.p  pPlease advice what to try next because this setup is pretty unusable at the moment.p
Negative 348 pI am fairly new to MVC, but have quite a bit of experience in development in general, and am having an issue with MVC request life cycle it seems.p  pWill try to keep this simple, even tho the project is a bit complex in some areas.p  pI have a view bound to a view model that has a few complex list properties. These properties are displayed via checkboxes whos IDs are not directly related to any property in the model, but instead related to the IDs of the objects in the Listlt. Because of this, the checked values do not automatically get applied to the model on POST. p  pTo get around that, I added code in the Action method in the controller that parses the proper controls in the Request.Form collection and assigns the checkedselected value to the proper list items in the model.p  pThis works perfectly up to a point.p  pNow, I also use Fluent Validation, and the problem is when performing custom validation rules when posting a new model to the server. The Validation routine is firing BEFORE the controllers action method, and thus before my processing of the list objects. p  pSo, my question is, is there a way I can override the initial call to the model validation so I can just call the validation manually after my processing I know I can do that which will fix the problem without overriding the initial call, but some of the validation takes a bit of time to process since it requires linq queries to a live database, so I do not want the validation to fire 2 times  that will quite literally double the time it takes to return no matter if the model is valid or not. p  pEDIT Adding a examplep  precodenamespace Models    [ValidatortypeofMemberValidator]   public class ViewMember        public int MemberID  get set              public short RegionID  get set             public ListltPropTypeInfogt PropTypes  get set       codepre  pPropTypeInfo classp  precodepublic class PropTypeInfo      public byte ID  get set      public string Name  get set      public string Description  get set      public bool Selected  get set       public PropTypeInfobyte i, string n, string d, bool sel              ID  i         Name  n         Description  d         Selected  sel          public static ListltPropTypeInfogt GetAllbool selected  false              ListltPropTypeInfogt output  new ListltPropTypeInfogt          OpenAccess.Context context  new OpenAccess.Context          var list  from f in context.PropTypes orderby f.PropType select f.ToList          foreach OpenAccess.WebrentzServerPayments.Models.PropType p in list             output.Addnew PropTypeInfop.PropType, p.PropName, p.DisplayText, selected          return output       codepre  pnow here is the code in the view that renders the checkboxes for each item in the listp  precodeltdiv classColumn EmpPropTypesgt   foreach WebrentzServerPayments.Models.PropTypeInfo ptype in Model.PropTypes        ltdiv stylefloatrightwidth20fontweightboldgt       Html.CheckBoxptype  ptype.ID, ptype.Selected, new Valueptype.ID Html.Rawampnbsp ptype.Name     ltdivgt    ltdivgt  codepre  pAnd here is the code I use in the Controller Action method to pull that data back in to the Listp  precodeforeach PropTypeInfo info in member.PropTypes             info.Selected  form[string.Formatptype0, info.ID].Containsinfo.ID.ToString codepre  pAs a little background, a PropType is a type of property house, condo, apartment  there are about 2 dozen of them, and more can be addedremoved at any time.

Negative 348 pI have two sites which communicate with each other.  Ill call them mainsite.com and backend.com for this example.p  pmainsite.com is the site that people go to, and this loads an iframe which loads in backend.com, which is a Rails site that handles all of the login amp signup stuff.  At the end of the login process, backend.com generates a url which has an encrypted set of params which are used to log the user into mainsite.com.  p  pThe way that this is currently working is that backend.com controller generates a url like this a hrefhttpmainsite.comauth2347qweiuyqi relnofollowhttpmainsite.comauth2347qweiuyqia and saves it in a variable called redirecturl, then in the iframe renders out some html which contains some javascript to redirect the parent pagep  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt   function        window.top.location.href  lt redirecturl gt     ltscriptgt codepre  pThis is working fine.  However, we have a new situation where people can now access mainsite.com via a load of different urls all subdomains on other sites, like mainsite.foo.com and mainsite.bar.comp  pNow, when i redirect them to the auth url on mainsite, i want them to stay on whichever domain theyre on.  So, if theyre on codemainsite.foo.comcode, and loading codebackend.comcode in the iframe, then at the end of the login process i want to redirect the parent window to codemainsite.foo.comauth2347qweiuyqicode.  Similarly, if theyre on codemainsite.bar.comcode they should be redirected to codemainsite.bar.comauth2347qweiuyqicodep  pMy initial attempt at this was to change the javascript to get the domain name from the parent window, and build the redirect url by adding the params onto the end, then redirecting to this url.  However, the iframe cant access the parent domain name because of crossdomain protection ie the domains, mainsite.foo.com, and backend.com, dont match.p  pMy next attempt was to have a javascript function on mainsite.com which takes the auth param and redirects to a url consisting of the current domain with that param added onto the end.  But, i cant call a parent window function because of the same crossdomain restrictions.p  pHow can I get past this  I have complete control over the content of both sites.p  pOne solution which i know would work, but is a bit of hassle to set up, is to pass through the mainsite domain name through as a parameter in the src attribute of the iframe to backend.com, and then make sure that backend.com hangs on to that through the whole loginsignup process, so that at the end of the process it can use it to build the whole url to redirect to.  But, it feels like there should be a simpler way.p  pthanks, Maxp  pEDIT  ive solved this by, when the first request comes through from codemainsite.comcode to codebackend.comcode, saving the hostname of request.referer into the session, and then, later on when i come to do the redirect, looking it up from the session and adding the auth params on.  This works but it feels a bit unsatisfactory so im interested in nicer solutions.p

Negative 348 pI am fairly new to embedded c outside of Arduino, but so far I have been able to fix all the problems I have run into, except this one. I am using Atmel Studio on an Atmega 1284P, coding in C.  I am using the following variables to compare to TTL Serial input the serial input is between 0 and 255 transferred in a single unsigned char bytep  precodeconst unsigned char STEERDEADZONEMIN  120 const unsigned char STEERDEADZONEMAX  120 const unsigned char THROTTLEDEADZONEMIN  136 const unsigned char THROTTLEDEADZONEMAX  136 codepre  pWhen I try to use STEERDEADZONEMIN or any of the listed unsigned chars they come out as 12.  I have confirmed that my program sees it as 12 using both the Atmel Studio simulator watch tool and by printing it out to the LCD on the embedded device.  I have actually come up with a fix for the unsigned char which is to remove const, but I have const there for a reason, since I dont want the value changed.  Declaring it asp  precodeunsigned char TEST  120 unsigned char TEST1  136 codepre  pthis causes the value to correctly be 120 or 136, but then the value can be accidentally changed.  It also seems that if I do the assignment inside my main loop asp  precodeconst unsigned char TEST  120 codepre  pThis also fixes the value, but introduces other problems since then none of my functions can access it.  p  pI am also having a seemingly related issue When it comes to a const unsigned int.  When I declare it outside the main loopp  precodeconst unsigned int SERVOESCSPEED  200 const unsigned int SERVOSTEERSPEED  200 const unsigned int SERVODISTANCESENSORSPEED  200 codepre  pThe value comes out as 37900, but, I have tried declaring it inside my main loop asp  precodeconst unsigned int TEST  200 codepre  pThat corrects the value, but as above, does not help since my functions no longer have access to it.  In this case, removing const outside the main loop doesnt fix the value.  I am really at a loss at this point.  I only other thing that I can think of to try at this point is to create a settings class with all these const variables and see if that corrects the values.  I will be trying that next and updating with results.  p

Negative 348 pI have a DataGrid in my view and DataGrid has cells with buttons, which have commands assigned. Now I wish to pass current row object which sits in DataGrid.CurrentItem to command execution logic.p  pMy initial idea was to use CommandParameter with value converter, where converter would take DataGrid as parameter and extract required information from DataGrid into my own class  in such way I would avoid reference to DataGrid from my view model. p  pProblem is, that CommandParameter bindingvalue conversion is executed when grid is shown, meaning that there is no selected item yet.p  pCan I somehow avoid bringing DataGrid reference into my command execution logic, like deffer CommandParameter resolution until Command is performed or something like thatp  pUpdate I need CurrentItem and CurrentColumn, Ive realized, that CurrentItem might be accessible through binding of SelectedItem, so to avoid receiving answers with proposing use SelectedItem property.p

Negative 348 pMy team is building a new internal ASP.NET MVC 5 app with Windows Authentication. When we need to retrieve the users SID we do so like thisp  precodepublic BaseController  Controller      protected SecurityIdentifier GetSid              var wi  WindowsIdentitythis.User.Identity          SecurityIdentifier sid  wi.Owner         return sid       codepre  pOn our local dev machines this works perfectly. We are able to retrieve the users SID, store it, and later use the SID to query Active Directory for user information. To be clear, running the site on one developers machine and accessing it from another devs machine still works as expected. These are Windows 7 laptops running the site under IIS not Express.p  pThe site is also deployed to a test server. The test server is running Windows Server 2008 R2 and again the site is running under IIS. When accessing the test site the user is recognized through Windows Auth and is not required to log in. However, retrieving the user SID via the method above returns the emexact same SIDem for each and every user.p  pPotentially useful infop  ul licodethis.Identity.User.Namecode emisem the correct username for each user.li liThe master SID looks like S1254632. I doubt that a SID is a sensitive number, but I changed the last 6 digits to be safe.li liThe real user SIDs have over 30 digitsli ul  pThis one SID is much shorter than the user SIDs retrieved on the dev machines. Further, when we attempt to query Active Directory for the user associated with this SID no user is found. Barring any other explanation I have assumed that this has something to do with the IIS or perhaps AD settings on the test server. I have limited experience with IIS configuration and virtually zero with AD. Regardless, Ive tried tweaking a few settings for the site in IIS but the results are still the same. What could cause the test server to behave differently in this regardp

Negative 348 pIve been researching this problem for a while now and I cant find a solution. InDesign has several things that are not as practical as one would like. One of them is, of course, the fact that is seems impossible to be able to copy GREP Styles from one Paragraph Style and paste them into another. As one designs a document, the need for certain GREP styles arises and one has to add them on.p  pIn this particular project, I was adding GREP styles to my most basic paragraph style and these GREP styles appeared successfully in all children paragraph styles. But at some point this stopped working. I now add a GREP to my basic style and it no longer appears in its children.p  pSo I searched all over the Internet and found a script somewhere that people said worked in order to propagate GREP styles between paragraph styles. However, the script pasted online had formatting issues which prevented it from working. I since cleaned it up and it runs but still has an issue, because I always get the following errorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7lIe2.jpg altInDesign Script Errorp  pThis is the script as it is now, cleanedp  precodeThis utility will copy GREP styles into styles that are nested in up to two levels of groups i.e. Main Style GroupgtHeadings GroupgtHeading 1 Copy the text below to a text editor like NotePad or TextEdit, then save as a file with a .js ending.

My question is, since Ive heard that pausing a thread is very dangerous and can lead to several problems, how can I replace the Thread.Sleep with lets say a DispatcherTimer What if I would add 1000000 elements to this list and report the progress Is it better to use Thread.Sleep1 or something else in this casep  pMy code is the followingp  precode    private BackgroundWorker worker  new BackgroundWorker      public MainWindow              InitializeComponent           private void btnAggiungiClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              worker.WorkerReportsProgress  true         worker.DoWork  workerDoWork         worker.ProgressChanged  workerProgressChanged         worker.RunWorkerCompleted  workerRunWorkerCompleted         worker.RunWorkerAsync           private void workerDoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e              String text  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.         int min         int max  10          for min  1 min lt max min                      int progressPercentage  Convert.ToInt32doublemin  max  100             worker.ReportProgressprogressPercentage, text             Thread.Sleep100                    private void workerProgressChangedobject sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e              pb.Value  e.ProgressPercentage         lstLoremIpsum.Items.Adde.UserState.ToString           private void workerRunWorkerCompletedobject sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e              lblCompleted.Content  Done      codepre  pScreenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comw693n.jpg altp

Negative 348 pIt seems codeUnmappedResourceHandlercode is loading composite components xhtml files within the resources folder. The result seems a gradually increasing memory leak.p  pThe leak can be found within codeFaceletViewHandlingStrategy.metadataCachecode. It relies on a hashmap and when above handler is used codeUnmappedResourcescode are used as the key for codeCompositeComponentBeanInfocode instances.p  pIf the codeUnmappedResourceHandlercode isnt used, the key contains codeResourceImplcode. The difference is that codeUnmappedResourcecode does not implement codeequalscode as codeResourceImplcode doesp  precodeOverride public boolean equalsObject o      if this  o          return true          if o  null  getClass  o.getClass          return false           ResourceImpl resource  ResourceImpl o     return resourceInfo.equalsresource.resourceInfo  codepre  pSo problem seems that in the first case codeCompositeComponentBeanInfocode is added again and again to the codemetadataCachecode.

Negative 348 pI have been working on a browser based file uploader that sends files to our S3 buckets for the past couple of months. Ive made great progress in the last couple of weeks. However, my biggest road block came in the form of iDevices. Pretty much anything that runs on iOS 8 has been giving me major headaches relating to my uploader. I am able to run my program on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on desktopslaptops on both PC and MAC. However, when it comes to mobile devices, only Android devices work the intended way. On iOS, Chrome only uploads small files and anything large will return a file that has a size of 0. Safari out right fails. I know that there have been issues with iOS 8 relating to this issue, but from my research, this issue should have been taken care of already. Anyways, I was wondering if there was a work around this problem so that I can upload my files like I am doing for the other devices and browsers.p  pstrongError uploading a small image filestrongp

Negative 348 pHello all  Im pretty new to Optimization and barely understand it was about ready to slit my wrist after figuring out how to write Objective Functions without any formal learning on the matter, and need a little help on a work project.p  pHow would I go about setting a logical constraint when using the Optimization Toolbox, fmincon specifically using Trust Region Reflective algorithm p  pI am optimizing 5 values lets call it matrix OptMat, and I want to optimize with the constraint such that p  precodemaxOptMatminOptMat gt 10 codepre  pI assume this will optimize the 5 values of OptMat as low as possible, while keeping the above constraint in mind so that if a set of values for OptMat is found with a lower OF in which it breaks the constraint it will NOT report those values and instead report the next lowest OF where OptMat values meet the above constraint p  pFor the record, my lower bounds are [0,0,0,0,0]. Im not sure how to enter it into upper bounds as it only accepts doubles and that would be logical. I tried the Active Set Algorithm and that enabled the Nonlinear Constraint Function box and I think Im on the right track with that. If so, Im not sure what the syntax for entering my desired constraint. Another methodthat may or may not work I could think of is using this as an Upper Boundary.p  precode[minOptMat10, minOptMat10, minOptMat10, minOptMat10, minOptMat10]    codepre  pAgain, Im using the GUI Optimization Toolbox. I havent looked too much into command line optimization though I will need to write it command line eventually and I think I read somewhere that you can set the Upper Boundary and it does not have to be doublep  pThank you so very much for the help, if someone is able. I apologize if this is a really nooby question.p

Negative 348 pFirstly, apologies if the question title didnt make much sense, was finding it tricky to word it correctly Im pretty confident in ObjectiveC but for a new project Ive had to take on Swift something ive been pretty apprehensive about. p  pAnyway, Ive noticed something on a simple tableViewController tutorial that is driving me crazy. p  pFirst a new class is set up for each row with both a text and checked variable. An array is then made up of objects of this class to populate the table rows. p  pBut in the tutorial makers code, he changes the checked property of a particular row using p  precode let item  items[indexPath.row]   item.checked  item.checked codepre  pWhere codeitems[indexPath.row]code just picks out the required object in the array codeitemscode. This is where I am confused, surely the first line creates a NEW clone object that is in no other way linked to the object in the arrayp  pHowever, when changing any of codeitemcodes variables e.g. how it swaps the state of codeitem.checkedcode that change is applied to the ORIGINAL array object codeitems[indexPath.row]code which just makes no logical sensep  pSurely I would have to implement some kind of logic to make this happen, for example p  precodeitems[indexPath.row]  item codepre  pTo apply all the changes to codeitemcode back to the original object Can someone please explain this backwards connection that is apparently there p  pThank you in advance, hopefully Im just missing something simplep
Negative 348 pIm building a clustering algorithm in C, but I dont deal well with OOP and the state of variables member data that change.  For an algorithm of some complexity, I find this an obstacle to my development.p  pSo, I was thinking in changing the programming language, to one of the functional languages Ocaml or F.  Apart from having to change my mindset on how to approach programming, theres something that I need to be clarified.  In C, I use a double end queue to slide a window of time through the data.  After some period of time, the oldest data is removed and newer data is appended. Data that is not yet too old remains in the double end queue.p  pAnother, and more demanding task, is to compare properties of one of each objects. Each object is the data from a certain period of time. And if I have one thousand data objects at a certain time window, I need to compare each one to between none or twenty or thirty, depending.  And some properties of that object being compared may change as a result of this comparison. In C, I do it all using references, which means that I access objects in memory, that they are never copied,  thus the algorithm runs at full speed for my knowledge of C.p  pIve been reading about functional programming, and the idea I get is that each function performs some operation and that original data the input is not changed.  This means that the language copies the data structure and performs the required transformation.  If so, using functional programming will delay the execution of the algorithm a great deal.  Is this correct  If not, i.e., if there is a speedy way to perform transformation in data, is it possible to show me how to do it  A very small example would be great.p  pIm hoping to have some kind of facility. Ive read that both Ocaml and F are used in research and scientific projects.p

Negative 348 pI am trying to add a feature to a JavaTomcat webapplication to follow the users during their visits on a website A through Javascript calls from the pages of A to a server B Bs applications run on Tomcat 7. The server has a different address from the website.p  pEach time a user opens a page on A a piece of Javascript is loaded from a url on B. The javascript is served on B by a controller method, which calls HttpServletRequest.getCookies and looks for a cookie with the right name. If no such cookie is found, a new one is created and added to the response through HttpServletResponse.addCookie. The cookie mentions the path and IP of B, so they are available there.p  pThe Javascript on A will then regularly send Ajax POST calls to B, where cookies are checked. p  pWhile this scenario works fine for many users, I still get a large number of Ajax calls from A to B without any cookie. Not only the cookies I set manually are missing, but also the session cookies set by Tomcat on B. I understand some users may have just set their browser to prevent or block cookies, but there seem to be too many empty requests. Despite a thorough inspection of the logs, I could not find any common feature that would explain the lack of cookies.p  pAny idea of what I might be doing wrong p

Negative 348 pI am building a movement logic for some elements on a map. I have the tiles defined by their X and Y position and now I need to assign an element to a tile.

Here is the table structure I have so far, I would like your opinion if you think there is a better way.p  precodeCREATE TABLE organization      id INT11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,     name VARCHAR255 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     PRIMARY KEY id   CREATE TABLE user      id INT11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,     firstname VARCHAR50 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     lastname VARCHAR50 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     email VARCHAR50 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     password VARCHAR255 NOT NULL COLLATE utf8unicodeci,     PRIMARY KEY id,     UNIQUE INDEX email email   CREATE TABLE timelog      id INT11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,     userorganizationid INT11 NOT NULL,     date DATE NOT NULL,     time TINYINT4 NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY id,     INDEX userorganizationid userorganizationid,     CONSTRAINT fktimeloguserorganization FOREIGN KEY userorganizationid REFERENCES userorganization id   CREATE TABLE userorganization      id INT11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,     userid INT11 NOT NULL,     organizationid INT11 NOT NULL,     admin TINYINT1 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,     PRIMARY KEY id, userid, organizationid, admin USING BTREE,     INDEX userid userid,     INDEX organizationid organizationid,     CONSTRAINT fkuserorganizationorganization FOREIGN KEY organizationid REFERENCES organization id,     CONSTRAINT fkuserorganizationuser FOREIGN KEY userid REFERENCES user id  codepre  pI chose to go with an codeidcode field on the codeuserorganizationcode table because it made creating a foreign key to the codetimelogcode table easier. However, I could also just put the codeuseridcode, and codeorganizationidcode in the codetimelog tablecode as well.p
Negative 348 pAlthough recursive programming style isnt recommended in Java Card, I want to make a little test on the Fibonacci algorithm. I wrote a function that compute the Fibonaccis suite for big integers represented by byte arrays.p  pMy code is the followingp  precodepublic static byte[] fibonaccibyte[] n      if isLEThan1n          return n          else          return addfibonaccisubtractn, new byte[]0x01,fibonaccisubtractn,new byte[]0x02       codepre  pwhere codeboolean isLEThanbyte[]code returns codetruecode if the integer represented by the byte array is less or equal than 1, codefalsecode if not.p  pcodebyte[] addbyte[], byte[]code and codebyte[] subtractbyte[], byte[]code implement addition and subtraction for big integers represented by byte arrays. They return a new byte array containing the result of the operation.p  pI thought that by giving a large array to the function described above, I will get an exception such as codeSystemException.NORESOURCEcode because of the number of array instantiated by subtract due to recursive calls.p  pBut I have to think that I dont catch the right exception because I get code6F00code as status word.p  pHeres the list of exceptions that I considerp  precodetry          fibonacciarray      catch ArithmeticException e          ISOException.throwItshort 0x0100      catch ArrayStoreException e          ISOException.throwItshort 0x0200      catch APDUException e          ISOException.throwItUtil.makeShortbyte 0x03,             byte e.getReason      catch CryptoException e          ISOException.throwItUtil.makeShortbyte 0x04,             byte e.getReason      catch ISOException e          ISOException.throwItUtil.makeShortbyte 0x05,             byte e.getReason      catch PINException e          ISOException.throwItUtil.makeShortbyte 0x06,             byte e.getReason      catch ServiceException e          ISOException.throwItUtil.makeShortbyte 0x07,             byte e.getReason      catch SystemException e          ISOException.throwItUtil.makeShortbyte 0x08,             byte e.getReason      catch TransactionException e          ISOException.throwItUtil.makeShortbyte 0x09,             byte e.getReason      catch ClassCastException e          ISOException.throwItshort 0x0A00      catch IndexOutOfBoundsException e          ISOException.throwItshort 0x0B00      catch NegativeArraySizeException e          ISOException.throwItshort 0x0C00      catch NullPointerException e          ISOException.throwItshort 0x0D00      catch SecurityException e          ISOException.throwItshort 0x0E00           codepre  pSo, does somebody have an idea about the exception concerned in that casep
Negative 348 pSuppose we have base class codeAcode with at least one virtual method. Suppose then we have another class codeBcode that derives from codeAcode and may or may not override this virtual method.p  pFinally, suppose you create an object of class codeBcode with local scope, and call this virtual method.p  pFrom the C docs we know that if this virtual method is inlined, the inline version will be used, because class type is known and this is not pointer or reference, but the class itself.p  pWill virtual dispatch be used in this case or it will be bypassed Will this work for normal non inline methodsp  pI am interested in gcc  clang.p

Negative 348 pI have a Laravel job that I dispatch to read customer data from a file. The job has a logger model dependency, and this logger tracks certain stats then writes to a log db table when the job completes. When I dispatch this job immediately it works fine, but if I queue the exact same job with the exact same parameters and then run it from the queue it fails with the errorp  precode[IlluminateDatabaseEloquentModelNotFoundException]                  No query results for model [appModelsMyModel]. codepre  pI think this is due to the serializeunserialize nature inherent in the Laravel queue system which breaks Eloquent, which tries the findOrFail method when I am never actually trying to find something in the db. I am merely creating a new log from a blank model. Whatever the case, it is clear that the same Laravel job, when not queued, runs fine  but it fails when queued. I am at a loss and wondering if there is a way to work around this issue. p  pThanks.p
