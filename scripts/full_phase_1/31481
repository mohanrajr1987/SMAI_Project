Positive 31481 pCrystal Report is used to generate PDFs in the system. We would like to know if there are any possibility to add Tab Order in the report. So that the fields in a report can be numbered to denote the order the cursor has to move on Tab press. Since the reading order of the PDF generated depends on the order of the fields placed in the rpt file, setting Tab Order will help in reordering the fields so that the PDF is properly read from top to bottom.p

Positive 31481 pI have a bunch of reports with margin formulas. The page margins depend on the current page number and the current page orientation. The formulas are the same in every report.

Positive 31481 pI am running a report on multiple salespersons and their multiple clients. I have a group header, which includes the name of the salesperson for that group, and a secondary group header, which includes the name of each of the salespersons clients and all their info as well as headings for the columns with information. Ive set up both group headings to appear at the top of every page. It works for the most part with the group header at the top of every page along with the corresponding secondary group header for the particular client being reported on. However, Ive run into a small problem. Sometimes when the next group for a for the next client is started its toward the end of the page so that the end of page has the secondary group header with none of the details only to repeat at the top of the next page with the corresponding details. I dont want to start a new page for each client as some clients dont have a lot of information and multiple clients can be included on a page. How do I set it up so that if there is not enough space on a page for any details, the secondary header does not appear until the next pagep  pThank you. p

Positive 31481 pmy application calls crystal reports viewer to display a report. I run the report viewer in a separate thread. It works just fine. it displays the report properly. my problem is i want to kill the report while it is processing if it is taking too long to run. While the report is processing the busy indicator is spinning and it seems to block any UI on the report viewer form. My report viewer form has a crystal reports viewer on it along with a close button at the bottom of the form itself. i would like to be able to click the close button and have it stop the processing. Here is my code to run the viewer in a single apartment threadp  precode public void RunReportStep1UAReport report              UAReportService service  new UAReportServicereport         service.RunReport         var reportDocument  service.ReportDocument            Thread staThread  new Threadr gt  RunReportStep2ReportDocument r          staThread.SetApartmentStateApartmentState.STA         staThread.StartreportDocument         staThread.Join           public void RunReportStep2ReportDocument reportDocument              ReportViewerForm form  new ReportViewerFormreportDocument         form.BringToFront         form.ShowDialog         if form.DialogResult  DialogResult.OK                    codepre  pwhat is the best way to kill the thread from within the report viewer form while the processing is going on. Once the processing completes and the report is destroyed closing the report is no problem. Its only a problem while the processing is going on before the report is displayed. While the report is processing the close button is not responsive. sometimes if i click it repeatedly i can get a response and the report cancels. but it is not consistent and i have to click it repeatedly. that is not acceptable for my clients to have to do.p

Positive 31481 pIm trying to get the data risers to show their value AND a custom label inside the riser itself. For instance, in a simple bar chart showing Miles Driven in a month, I have a chart that shows 53,211 right on the center of the riser. In addition to this, Id like to be able to say Miles. So, in the center of the riser it would read 53,211 Miles. I can select the chart option to show label amp value, but it just uses the table column name as the label which is something ugly like METER1USAGE which wouldnt look good inside the riser. Is it possible to add a custom label name to a riserp

Negative 31481 pIm hitting a road block and Im wondering if the brilliant collective minds here can help. In ObjC CocoaTouch Im trying to mock an object that takes struct parameters and returns a struct. OCMock is coughing up a hairball so I tried wrapping with a Hamcrest matcher. No die.

So in my object that Im testing I make the necessary required edits to get a green bar... err.. green button in the build info window. When Im certain that my test should pass I get assertion failed errors. The errors inform me that the method was invoked unexpectedly and lists the values for these structs as question marks. I tried wrapping the structs with Hamcrest matchers but Im getting nowhere. Im getting ready to break out my debugger which will no doubt show me whats wrong. Has anybody here had similar trouble with OCMockHamcrest and structs If so, whats the best way to handle these typesp

Negative 31481 pI found a couple posts regarding this error on StackOverflow and posts on various forums. There doesnt seem to be any one cause or solution for this error.p  pSo that it might help somebody else, below is the text of an email I sent to DevExpress regarding my experience with this error.p  p A month or two ago I installed an update to the CodeRush Express and the free Refactor products and it reset my Visual Studio settings.p  pThis week I installed the Silverlight developer tools. When I tried to install the RIA Services, it failed with an error that something was missing, I dont remember what it was. Given the prior problem when I updated the DevEx products, I decided to do a complete reinstall of Visual Studio. I uninstalled Visual Studio and all related products and reinstalled. Afterwards, whenever I opened a website in VS, VS would close and the following error message was entered in the event log .NET Runtime version 2.0.50727.3082  Fatal Execution Engine Error 7A035FC0 80131506.p  pNot finding a clear fix anywhere, I did another complete uninstall of Visual Studio and all related products, and started reinstalling and testing after each item. I installed everything else before the DevEx products Visual Studio and SP1, the Silverlight 3 Tools, Expression Blend, Deep Zoom Composer, Silverlight 3 Toolkit and the RIA Services. After I installed CodeRush Express and Refactor Free ASP.NET, everything was still working. After I installed Refactor Free VB.NET, VS again started closing whenever a website was loaded and making the same event log entry.p  pAfter I uninstalled Refactor VB.NET, the problem went away.p  pThe DevEx installs and the Microsoft Silverlight developer tools installs dont appear to be getting along together.p

Negative 31481 pI have a simple application that counts down to midnight and then plays a beeping sound over and over again and blinks the label showing the time. So the label blinking uses an NSTimer, while the beeping goes on its own Thread, so that the pure C function for the system sound id completion callback can use [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval...] to wait a bit in between playing the alarm beep sound. So I get two error messages during execution saying theres no autorelease pool and it will just leak. Its because in the method that I call into a new thread, Theres two Strings that are used to create the System Sound ID the file name and extension. Is there a way I can not use an autorelease pool since those are the only two things that ever try to use it. Thanks.p  pOr should I use two NSTimers instead of another thread..p  pBen Gottliebs answer was right, however I decided to use another NSTimer instead because I forgot about how its not really synced to the time when you sleep the thread as the actual execution of the code before it takes a bit of time. And it makes things symmetrical .p

Id like to hear any thoughts about overcoming the difficulty inherent in reasoning about the performance of a lazilyexecuted, functional programming language.p  hr  pstrongSummarystrong  Im accepting 3lectrologoss answer, because the point that you dont reason so much about the languages performance, as about your compilers optimization, seems to be extremely important in Haskell  more so than in any other language Im familiar with.

Negative 31481 pAfter writing a few python appengine apps I find myself torn between two approaches to organizing my source code tree wide or deep.  p  pFor concreteness, consider an internal application for a small consulting shop to manage business operations like contact management, project tracking amp reporting, and employee management.

If anything else is found other than endofscript or failure that should be counted as an error and should be looped till found. If it still isnt found after the third try, could an error message be displayed Such as Error  Please try again.p  pThank you for all your assistance and I will appreciate each and every single reply.

Negative 31481 pI have a Delphi 6 application where I have an array of TBitmaps each containing an image subimage that was created by making a call to FillRect with clWhite to flood the TBitmaps Canvas with white, followed by a call toTextOut to print some text to the Bitmaps Canvas.  p  pI have a timer that updates the main Canvas, which belongs to a TImage component, with the contents of the array every Interval to reflect changes made to each subimages X, Y coordinates since they are in motion.  First I use FillRect with clWhite to flood the main Canvas with white.  To print the subimages I simply iterate the array and call Alphablend to print each subimage on to the main Canvas.  Each subimage has a Z coordinate that is used to control the level of opacity.  Subimages with higher Z coordinates have a lower Alphablend value to make them appear more transparent than those that are up close.p  pThe alphablending works great with each individual subimage and those that have higher coordinates do indeed appear to be more transparent than those with lower Z coordinates.  However, Im having a problem with subimages that overlap in Z space.  Alphablending between overlapping subimages does not appear to work.  Instead, the subimage behind the overlapping subimage is occluded by the white background belonging to the image that overlays it.  What I want is for the two subimages to overlap properly so it looks like two text strings are written on top of each other.  Instead I see the front text string and everywhere the white background that comprises its TBitmaps Canvas exists, wiping out the text string behind it.p  pCan anyone tell me why alphablending is working between each individual subimage and the main Canvas, but not between subimages  I say between subimages only in a temporal context and not as objects because they should all become part of the main Canvas as they print and I would expect alphablend to blend them properly, which is not happening.p  pIts almost as if the white between subimages is not being treated the same as the white between a subimage and the white belonging to the main Canvas.p  pFOLLOWUP In response to Andreas comment I set the PixelFormat of all subimage TBitmaps to pf32bit.  Now alphablending is taking place between subimages. Unfortunately, the the subimages white areas are not being treated as a Transparent color.  Instead the white background of the subimage that is on top is being alphablended with the text belonging to the underlying subimage creating a light gray frame around the subimage on top as if it was smeared.  To get the effect I want I need the white background of a subimage to be completely ignored.p
Negative 31481 pIm running a bit of code in Vim and having a problem I think with not being in the correct mode.  Im trying to get the text between either lt  or [ ] into a register.

If Im clicking between the [] brackets then it doesnt work at all, and the literal text [xy gets inserted at cursor position.p  pIve tried a couple different workarounds, e.g., trying to put  into the keystrings or a separate normal command or using visual command after each visual part.  Cant get things going with  and the Visual command avoids the character inserts on second part but but also seems to screw up getting the visual match into the x register.p  pIm a little confused and not sure what mode Im in exactly at all parts of script normal, visual, or insert.  I run through things manually and it seems to work fine but if I do it programmatically it behaves unexpectedly.p  pIs there some simple thing Im missing  I could do what I want another way, but this method at first look seemed like easiest and most straightforward.  Is itp  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 31481 pWe have a .NET ecommerce application with a SQL Server 2005 backend. A new order requires certain postprocessing. These tasks include sending emails, creating files, uploading files to an FTP server, and performing CRUD operations against a WCF data service. The code to perform all these tasks is already in place as several .NET class libraries. p  pThe debate that my team is having is where to place this code. Ive written a simple Windows service that polls the db at regular intervals and upon detecting new transactions based on flags in the db, it does the necessary thing and logs any errors. An alternative that has been proposed is a SQLCLR INSERT trigger that will set off the processing. p  pI know its technically possible to do much all of the above tasks in SQLCLR  Ive even found a number of articles explaining how to consume web services from within SQLCLR, so apparently people are doing this. But I am still hesitant. Was SQLCLR ever intended for this kind of thing And if not, what could be the practical downside As for the potential benefits of a SQLCLR trigger over a windows service, I can only see one less db traffic. We expect very light transaction volume initially, so the windows service will generate some wasteful traffic. But the service is on the same box as the database, so it doesnt even affect the network, only internal server resources. p  pFinally, a third possibility would be to use a SQLCLR trigger to save a simple token on the file system, and use FileSystemWatcher in the Windows service instead of Timer to perform the tasks as needed.p  pPlease share your thoughts on the tradeoffs of these different approaches or suggest a better alternative.p

Negative 31481 pFor the last few days, I have been trying to use Python for some audio development.p  pThe thing is, Mac OSX does not handle uninstalling stuff well. Actually, there is no way to uninstall anything. Once it is on your system, you better pray that it didnt do any funny stuff. Hence, I dont really want to rely on installer packages for Python.p  pSo I turn to Homebrew and install Python using Homebrew. Works fabulously. Using pip, Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib were no big problem, either. Now I want to play audio. There is a host of different packages out there, but pip does not seem willing to install any. emButem, there is a binary distribution for PyGame, which I guess should work with the builtin Python.p  pHence my question What would you do Would you just install the binary distributions and hope that they interoperate well and never need uninstalling Would you hack your way through whichever package control management system you prefer and deal with its problems Something elsep

Negative 31481 pAfter programming a little in C I decided to jump right into C. At first I was pleased with the presence of the string class and being able to treat strings as whole units instead of arrays of characters. But I soon found that the Cstyle strings had the advantage of letting the program move through it character by character, using pointer arithmetic, and carry out a desired logical operation. p  pI have now found myself in a situation that requires this but the compiler tells me it is unable to convert from type string to the Cstyle strings. So I was wondering, is there a way to use pointer arithmetic to reference single characters or to pass arguments to a function as the address of the first character  while still using the string class without having to create arrays of characters or do I just want to have my cake and eat it toop

Ive found a schematic of how to connect the switches to the pins, but I have not been able to find any example code on how you can read the state of the switches.p  pThe schematic is located here a hrefhttpirtel.unimannheim.depxlabdocmanualDevices.html relnofollowhttpirtel.unimannheim.depxlabdocmanualDevices.htmlap  pAnyone have any ideas how you could use vb.net or C to read the state of the switch on one of these control linesp

On most recent iOS devices, loading all of those icons into memory before displaying the table works totally fine, but on older hardware, Id like to implement a lazy load system that only loads icons it needs.p  pIve implemented the Apple a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarysamplecodeLazyTableImagesindex.html relnofollowLazyTableImagesa example, which uses a UIScrollView delegate to determine when the table stops moving to load the visible icons, but Ive run into another snag.p  pMy UITableView also has a section index display ie the list of labels on the right hand side you can swipe up and down to scroll quickly, and the LazyTableImages example hasnt taken this into account. If I scroll using the index, the images wont lazyload. p  pAs far as I can see, the scroll index doesnt actually have any delegate events it triggers.

Negative 31481 pIm building a fairly large plugindriven app in my spare time, and have come across a show stopping design flaw.  My app uses policytraits based design, but because I use Qt it is done just through MI rather than templates and MI.  Some of these classes are pure virtual and some perform rather critical functions under the hood that the enduser should never touch.p  pMy problem is that some of these classes require signalsslots and therefore derive from QObject, no problem I can just virtually inherit from it.  However, the problem I have is when I want derive from a Qt class and then extend it with one or more of my traits, egp  precodeclass SyabstractGLViewport  public QGLWidget, public Sysaveable, public SyabstractObject      ...  codepre  pHere QGLWidget is derived from QObject, but not virtually, causing ambiguity problems.p  pIve considered a Bridge pattern where I make for example my codeSysaveablecode pure virtual and then derive a codeSysaveableimpcode from it that contains the actual implementation.  Then use that for my codeSyabstractGLViewportcode via aggregation.p  pThis to me seems rather unprofessional, because the app is plugin based, its a bit of a PITA for my future plugin writers to hook up all the interface methods to the aggregated instance.

Negative 31481 pI have a MOUSEDOWN handler that creates a CLICK event listener on a child object. Naturally, as soon as you release the mouse button, if you happen to be over the child object, the CLICK event fires.p  pI was disappointed to discover that event.stopImmediatePropagation doesnt interrupt the CLICK event from registering the MOUSEDOWN as part of its detection cycle. It makes sense that it doesnt but still... disappointing.p  pA MouseEvent.CLICK consists of detecting a MOUSEDOWN on the object and then if its followed by a MOUSEUP without leaving the object, he event fires.

Negative 31481 pHi Guysbr I am kind of new to Jquery and web development, so please just bear with me.  I want to implement real time input validation with Jquery on my website. Maybe I have some syntax errors in this post, but I am sure I dont have any in my real code. p  pThis is what I have, whenever the user inputs something thats not blank the error will be called and make a post request to the server PHPMySQL to check if the input value already exists. The error is also used again when the submit button is pressed. p  pThis works perfectly fine before I press the submit button. If I enter something that already exists, the form will not be submitted.

Negative 31481 pSuppose I wanted to create a WCF WebHTTP service ServiceREST that had a reference to a duplex service ServiceDuplex.  ServiceDuplex requires implementations of certain callback members to deliver data that is requested from it.  For example, a call to GetCustomers on ServiceDuplex triggers a method on that service that serves the customers back to the client via a callback ReceiveCustomers.p  pThat being said, suppose I wanted a method GetSingleCustomer on ServiceREST.  Assuming all data is being retrieved on demand rather than caching after startup, Id have to first call GetCustomers from ServiceDuplex and wait for my collection to be filled inside of the callback I implement before I can search for the single customer I need.p  pSince webHttp doesnt support callbacks to the client, Im forced to use something like an AutoResetEvent inside of my GET GetSingleCustomer call until the duplexs callback fills the collection.p  pIs there a best practice for what Im trying to do, or is what Im trying to do so wrong that such a practice hasnt been createdp  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 31481 pDo you always call codefinishcode on some activity before going to another activityp  pFor example, in order to prevent user going to the previous activity via mobile back button, some people suggest that you should finish all activities, except the main one.

Negative 31481 pIm trying to localize my office addin, Ive read through many docs and tutorials on how to do this, but they all teach on how to localize it based on what the current Windows language, not necessarily what office language interface pack is in use. p  pSo I end up in a situation where my Windows language is French, I dont have any office language interface packs, therefore all my menus in the Office are in English, except my addin which is in French. It looks kind of odd, so I was wondering if theres a way to localize based on current office language interface pack in use.p

Negative 31481 pIm currently making a pacman game in java. I have a question about the ghosts though.p  pI understand that the ghosts do not all have the same style of attack. I first want to work on the basics of getting the ghost to go after the pacman and not worry about there differences yet.p  pMy question to you smart people out there is what would be the best way to make the ghosts chase the pacman but sometimes randomly divert paths. Im currently using a 21 by 21 2D array for telling where walls are and such so I was thinking make it more try and head for the current grid location of pacman. for example go to 10,14 Of course while avoiding going through walls like pacman. Im wondering how I could make it do this and also have the ghosts sometimes stop and go another direction or something so that its not always a constant chase and pacman has a chance to get away. Maybe some of you have programmed a pacman game or just know a good way for this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pPlease note Im currently in a Grade 11 Computer Science course and halfway through the first semester ever of learned java.p
Negative 31481 pHopefully this will be an easy one to answer. p  pI am working on a table that requires MTD data. One of our SQL guys told me to use p  precodeMONTH monthtodate 11 codepre  pWhere codemonthtodatecode is set to codeGetDatecode in the parameter list in SQL Server Management Studio. So in theory, he says, it should select the month 11 and then get today and return all the requested data in between those two dates. But Im thinking this isnt correct. p  pIn looking at my data Im starting to think that Its just returning data for the whole month of November instead of just MTD. I guess, technically, anything that has 0 wont be calculated. However that just means its poorly written code correctp  pIn your opinions, would this be the better way to return MTD datap  precodeproductiondate lt today and ProductionDate gt DATEADDmm, DATEDIFFmm, 0, today, 0 codepre  pThanks in advance everyonep
Negative 31481 pI have a class with a method in which a string will be passed. That method will do some things to that string and it then passes the string to a certain object which can do other things with the string.p  pSo it basically looks like thisp  precodeclass Main       public Main                strClass str  new strClassthis             public function handler                  console.logNo string is passed yet, but this method is called from receiveData         class strClass      object handler     public strClass  handler                save the object         this.handler  handler           public receiveData  string str                This method does some stuff with the string          And it then passes it on to the supplied object handler which will do          the rest of the processing           Im calling the handler method in the object which got passed in the           constructor         Type thisType  this.handler.GetType         MethodInfo theMethod  thisType.GetMethodhandler         theMethod.Invokethis.handler, null      codepre  pNow this code works good, with the reflection stuff.

Negative 31481 pIm inspecting running times, heap memory usage and nonheap memory usage of different algorithms to a specific sorting problem.p  pIve successfully been able to measure running time and heap memory usage, but I have problems measuring nonheap memory usage.p  pWhat I do when I try to measure it is I start a new thread which constantly checks if the nonheap memory has changed while Im running my sorting algorithm. This thread object records the highest value of the memory usage during the running of that algorithm.p  pThis works for ordinary heap memory or at least, I think it works as it provides logical results, but when I try to do the same for the nonheap memory, I seam to get a lot of 0 memory usage results.p  pI use ManagementFactory.memoryMXBean.getNonHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed to read the non heap memory and I figured that this memory is not freed when running the garbage collector I run System.gc 16 times to hopefully make the garbage collector collect the garbage before I record the initial memory I know this is only a suggestion, however this shouldnt matter as it doesnt do anything for the nonheap memory anyways i think. Im also guessing that this memory is not freed when things are popped from the stack because my results are largest in the first algorithms tried and therefore I suspect I get only the difference of the nonheap memory usage between each run and 0 if the latter run uses less memory than the former.p  pThis is my memory inspector classp  precodeclass MemoryInspectorThread extends Thread  private int samplingInterval  private long initialMemoryHeap private long initialMemoryNonHeap private long maxMemoryHeap private long maxMemoryNonHeap  private boolean killfalse  void kill      killtrue   long getMaxNewMemoryHeap      return maxMemoryHeapinitialMemoryHeap1024   long getMaxNewMemoryNonHeap      return maxMemoryNonHeapinitialMemoryNonHeap1024   MemoryInspectorThreadint samplingInterval      this.samplingIntervalsamplingInterval      try              sleep1000      catch InterruptedException e              e.printStackTrace           MemoryMXBean memoryMXBeanManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean      System.gc System.gc System.gc System.gc     System.gc System.gc System.gc System.gc     System.gc System.gc System.gc System.gc     System.gc System.gc System.gc System.gc      initialMemoryHeapmemoryMXBean.getHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed     initialMemoryNonHeapmemoryMXBean.getNonHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed  Override public void run      MemoryMXBean memoryMXBeanManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean      while kill                 long freeMemoryHeapmemoryMXBean.getHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed         long freeMemoryNonHeapmemoryMXBean.getNonHeapMemoryUsage.getUsed          if freeMemoryHeap gt maxMemoryHeap                      maxMemoryHeapfreeMemoryHeap                   if freeMemoryNonHeap gt maxMemoryNonHeap                      maxMemoryNonHeapfreeMemoryNonHeap                   try                      sleepsamplingInterval          catch InterruptedException e                      e.printStackTrace                 codepre  pHow can I get the actual nonheap memory Are my assumptions about how the thing works correctp

Routing determines what path a packet takes, to get to a host. p  pIm currently developing a game, with multiplayer networking, using UDP. Since the game is realtime, I need to effectively rollback the physics world, every time a packet is received, to determine what the client did, when they saw it happening. To do this, I must rollback the physics world, emnsecondsem, where n is the time is took the packet to travel from client to server. Latency is dynamic I think, correct me if Im wrong. p  pTo optimize this process, Im wondering if it would be possible, for a packet always to take a static route, so I can determine a static latency for the client. p

Negative 31481 pIm developing an app which makes usage of AVPlayer, MPMediaItem and MPMediaQuery. It works as long as Itunes match.

Even when AVPlayer status is playing, no sound comes. Is obvious that it is not triggering the song download from iCloud. p  pAll the information I have about itunes match by the moment is this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8145509mpmediaitemanditunesmatchMPMediaItem and iTunes Matchap  pwhich states you can trigger the download by using a MPMusicPlayerController play call. For the reasons given above, we cannot make use of this class to control our own player. p  pI have two ideas on how to solve this problem A. Find a way to check if a song is already downloaded and available in the library to play using AVPlayer. If the song is not available let the user know that we dont support songs not available. B. Find a way to trigger the download of the song just before it becomes the next item to play.p  pI still cannot find how to implement any of these solutions and I havent found any related documentation, so I submitted my app with a warning message to prevent users to use this app if they are using itunes match.p

If vlc gets to the last frame and pause the video by itself, how can I know about it  For now, I use codegettimecode in hope of simply considering the video paused if the countdown is equal to 0. However, it occurs that vlc pauses the video itself at 001, forcing me to also consier 001 as a finishing value. This results in a glitch when the user starts another video while there really is one second remaining before the last frame, since the 001 check is considering it as paused while its not.

Negative 31481 pI have a few function objects that have no member variables. The function objects are very simple in nature. They all inherit from codeunaryfunctionltgtcode or codebinaryfunctionltgtcode. For example, a couple of the function objects may be something like thisp  precodestruct keytohashmethod1  public binaryfunctionltint, int, intgt    int operator int a, int b const   do something     template lttypename keytohashmethodgt struct hashshrinkmethod1  public binaryfunctionltint, int, intgt, public keytohashmethod    int operator int a, int b const   do something while utilizing keytohashmethod      and more variations of these function objects  codepre  pA template class uses these function objects by taking them as template parameters as policies. The template class then inherits from themp  precodetemplate lttypename hashmethodgt class foo  public hashmethod   public  do something while using hashmethod as well as using the information provided by binaryfunctionltgt to selective compile different functions  codepre  pOf course, in the interest of keeping the example simple, the above may not make much sense as far as usefulness goes. p  pWhy am I inheriting instead of using composition Simply to avoid the empty classes from taking up space. Whether the space saved is minuscule or not is not the point of the question. p  pAs you can see from the above code, codebinaryfunctionltint, int, intgtcode will be inherited twice, which gives rise to the warning in VC 2008p  precodeWarning 1   warning C4584 hashshrinkmethod1ltkeytohashmethodgt  baseclass stdbinaryfunctionltArg1,Arg2,Resultgt is already a baseclass of keytohashmethod1    cvisual studio 2008projectsdefaulttemplateargumentsmain.cpp    12 codepre  pNow generally, in multiple inheritance, this is solved by virtual inheritance which I want to avoid in this case. What can I do in this situation to remove the warning p  pMy immediate solution is to not inherit from codebinaryfunctionltgtcode since I am assuming that codekeytohashmethodcode will be a codebinaryfunctioncode.

Negative 31481 pIve been tasked with designing a page to generate an inventorysales report for a sql server inventory database consisting of the following beginning stock, end of day stock, delivered items, sold items for a given day or range of days.p  pWhat I ended up doing is using a for loop to go through the range of days that stats are needed for and keeping a running tally of the stats for each day that is returned from my query.p  pThe parts table has a field named quantity that keeps track of the current stock for each item in the inventory. The deliveries table contains records of when items are delivered and the sales table contains records of when sales are made.p  pBecause of certain restrictions, Ive been only able to figure out the ending stock for a certain day for a given item by taking the current stock quantity and subtracting from it the quantity delivered and adding to that number the quantity sold for that day.

Negative 31481 pI have an assignment where I have a tree where all the parent nodes contain yes or no questions and the leaf nodes contain an answer.  There are two children per parent node, a yes node and a no node.  This tree needs to be serialized and stored in a file via RandomAccessFile so that the whole tree isnt written out to the file every time.  If the leaf node doesnt contain the answer the user is looking for, the user submits a new answer and a question to differentiate between the leafs answer and the answer he was thinking of.  Then this leaf becomes a parent with its own question and two children a yes node and a no node these two nodes are new leafs.  This process is whats giving me trouble because if a leaf is already written out to the file how can I overwrite the leaf without spilling into another nodes data since the byte size of a leaf node changes when it becomes a parent.  Note that the program can be killed at any time and its tree structure should still remain intact.  Thanksp

Instead Ill have to make a list of all the controls which should be posted and then do something like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions219827multipartformsfromcsharpclientthisa.p  pBut to do that I need to know how browsers determine which controls to include in the Postback body.

Negative 31481 pReally hope you can assist. I have built a stock management application with the Java Swing framework. This application has 1 abstract class named GUIRules which extends JPanel implements actionListener, and 8 different classes which extend GUIRules to represent each screen.p  precodepublic abstract class GUIRules extends JPanel implements ActionListener  public class login extends GUIRules  codepre  pThe fact is all of these 8 classes have a lot in common hence the reason I decided to provide each one of them with default functionality. p  pWhen I navigate to each screen, all loads up fine however, I eventually encounter Java Heap memory error. This is the method which enables the changing of screenp  precode       When switching between GUI screens, declare new GUI within parameters   param panel    public void changePanelJPanel panel     this.removeAll        this.addpanel      validate     setVisibletrue  codepre  pthis.removeAll is supposed to remove all components, thereby freeing memory. All action listeners are added within the constructors of all the 8 screens so this should also get disposed of when this function is called. p  pThis application also utilises images as well. p  pThe abstract class GUIrules calls paintComponent to load the background imagep  precode       Paint background, menu and logo images onto this class.   public void paintComponentGraphics g       super.paintComponentg     g.drawImageimage.mainImg, 0, 0,getWidth,getHeight,null     g.drawImageimage.menuImg, 0, 30, getWidth, 80, null      g.drawImageimage.logoImg, 0, 33, null g.setColorColor.CYAN     g.drawStringSystemSession.user, 10, 20     g.drawStringSystemSession.status, 10, getHeight10     repaint  codepre  pI have used Runtime.gc to garbage collect unused objects but not much difference.

All offline work is stored in local database and sync next time to central database when Application connects to the internet.This application has many users and all will work at same time on same information. p  pFor Example If a user enters an inventory item it is possible that another user also enter the same item at that time. Application should be able to validate correct information and prohibits user to duplication.p  pUser local database must be updated all times either other users are working or not. If other users are working all updated information should be available in local database to ensure when user goes offline all information is updated.p  pThe question is How to develop this kind of application Is there any standard way to achieve this target Is there any standard or non standard pattern to build this kind of softwarep  pPlease note I am using C Dot Net and Intend to use .NET Remoting or WCF or ASP.NET MVC for this application.p  pAny kind of help will be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 31481 pI have learned to create a popup dialog box using NotifyDescriptor. I have designed a JPanel with two big buttons which reads codePURCHASEcode and codeCASHOUTcode and the code i have used is showing another two button on the bottom which reads codeYescode and codeNocode.

I just want my buttons to be there and the popup would close and store the value when one of my custom buttons is clicked.Just like how it closes the window when codeyescode or codenocode is clicked.

So whats wrong with what I have donep  pThanks for helping me out, Im pretty new to PHP.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe post now represents all valid changes. p  pI got somewhere with codevardumpcode. I dumped codecontentcode just before the codereturncode statement. All of the articles in the database 2 of them were displayed inside of codestring2445 code. This confirms there are no problems with the query. I am now thinking it has something to do with the return statement.p
Negative 31481 pI am publishing Web Feeds containing charts embedded in the feed items in form of pictures and returned to the client polling the web feed using a MVC action, codeRSSImgfilenamecode.brp  pSome of the charts get updated together with the feed item and Id like to have the client reload the image once it has been modified at server side I can control when the chart is updated as this is performed by another controllers action.brp  pAt the same time, I do not want to avoid caching on the client side as this would hit me back with an impressive increase of bandwidth.brp  pWhat are my best options I have considered the followingp  ul liobviously change the image name  but it is not acceptable as it would break the feed items which might be forwarded as mail items  or greatly increase storage size in case I keep the old versionli limapping what are the syndication items which potentially might be updated, and in the action retrieving the image, setting codeResponse.Cache.SetCacheabilityHttpCacheability.Servercode just for those items em[actually I think I should put cacheability to none as I guess there is little advantage in caching the result of the codeRSSImgcode action it basically just load and return the file itself.]em.br This would require that I retrieve the id of the images subject to refreshing or frozen from a SQL server Im handling a great quantitiy of chart images, which will add a considerable burden on the WebApp.brMoreover, I cannot be always sure what are the items potentially being updated, so this approach is not covering 100 the requirement.li ul  pThe solution I was looking for was finding a simple way to invalidate the cache as I alter the image file  I can easily use something like codeHttpResponse.RemoveOutputCacheItemRSSImg  fileName.Valuecode but this seems to affect only the server cache.brp  pI do not have other options coming to my mind, any other practical approachp

Negative 31481 pI know this is bad practice. Dont write code like this if at all possible. p  pOf course, well always find ourselves in situations where a clever snippet of inline Javascript can address an issue quickly. p  pI am pursuing this query in the interest of fully understanding what happens and the potential pitfalls when something like this is written p  precodelta href onclickalertHigtClick Meltagt codepre  pAs far as I can tell this is functionally the same as p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt    function  I use jQuery in this example        document.getElementByIdclickme.onclick              function   alertHi      ltscriptgt lta href idclickmegtClick Meltagt codepre  pExtrapolating from this it seems that the string assigned to attribute codeonclickcode is inserted within an anonymous function which is assigned to the elements click handler.

It is so much easier and sometimes even makes sense for the code specifically related to this HTML element to be defined emright withinem the element When I decide 2 minutes later that this was a terrible, terrible idea I can nuke the entire div or whatever and I dont have a bunch of mysterious JS and CSS cruft hanging around in the rest of the page, slowing down rendering ever so slightly. This is similar to the concept of locality of reference but instead of cache misses were looking at bugs and code bloat. p

Since I need a view on top of the listview I dont want to extend list activity but rather call setcontentview and just refer to the list by its id. p  pNow my error isp  pjava.lang.IllegalStateException The content of the adapter has changed but ListView did not receive a notification. Make sure the content of your adapter is not modified from a background thread, but only from the UI thread. p  pI tried calling adapter.notifyDataSetChanged after my setAdapter but that didnt seem to work. Am I supposed to call it somewhere else p

Negative 31481 pIm trying to finish the search function in one of the sites Im developing. Since my search results only display excerpts of the contents of matched items, what I want to do is to highlight search terms within the search results and display only portions of texts that actually contain those search terms.p  pWhat I figured Id do is to fetch the whole content from the database and use codepregreplacecode to insert codeltspangtcode elements around the search terms and at the same time extract only the first 10 words before and after the term. So this is the regex part of itp  precode.wW0,10.implode, terms.WwW0,10 codepre  pBasically, I try to discard all text except the first 10 words before the search term by using a noncapturing subpattern, then get the 10 words before the term, then the term itself, then the next 10 words.p  pThis is the replacement text in codepregreplacecodep  precode1ltspan classsearchterm searchtermcontentgt2ltspangt3... codepre  pThe search term is being searched via the codeMySQLcodes codeMATCH...AGAINSTcode for codeMyISAM FULLTEXTcode indeces on multiple columns. However, the above regex is only being applied in one column lets call this column, the one that uses the above regex, codecontentcode.p  pSo my problem is whenever I get a match on other columns but not on the codecontentcode column, the regex above strips all text from the codecontentcode column. Thats because of the code.code subpattern at the very beginning which continues to match without ever finding the next subpatterns.p  pI was wondering if there was any other way to implement the original purpose of the regex without this side effect. I am currently thinking of simply using codepregmatchallcode to just match the search term and 10 words before and after it. Ill just iterate over all of the matches and build the preview text manually. Yes, this is a sound solution but given my inexperience with regex, I thought I might as well try to find a solution to this.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI just noticed that I only get blank codecontentscode when I put 2 or more search terms.

Negative 31481 pIn short in Clojure, is there a way to redefine a function from the standard sequence API which is not defined on any interface like ISeq, IndexedSeq, etc on a custom sequence type I wrotep  hr  h21.

Custom sequenceh2  pI want to have a sequence on these entries. Since I cannot usually hold all the data in memory at once, and I want emfastem sequential access on it, I wrote a class similar to the followingp  precodedeftype DataSeq [id                   long cnt                   long i                   cachedseq]   clojure.lang.IndexedSeq    index []     i   count []      cnt i   seq   [this]  this   first []     first cachedseq   more  [this]  iflet [s next this] s     next [] if not inc i cnt               if next cachedseq                 DataSeq. id cnt inc i next cachedseq                 DataSeq. id cnt inc i                           withopen [f opendatafile id]                               open a memory mapped byte array on the file                               seek to the exact position to begin reading                               decide on an optimal amount of data to read                               eagerly read and return that amount of data                            codepre  pThe main idea is to read ahead a bunch of entries in a list and then consume from that list. Whenever the cache is completely consumed, if there are remaining entries, they are read from the file in a new cache list. Simple as that.p  pTo create an instance of such a sequence, I use a very simple function likep  precodedefn DataSeq loaddata [id]   next DataSeq. id countentries id 1 []  countentries is a trivial open file and read a long memoized codepre  pAs you can see, the format of the data allowed me to implement codecountcode in very simply and efficiently.p  h23. codedropcode could be O1h2  pIn the same spirit, strongId like to reimplement codedropcodestrong. The format of these data files allows me to reimplement codedropcode in O1 instead of the standard On, as followsp  ul lipif dropping less then the remaining cached items, just drop the same amount from the cache and donepli lipif dropping more than codecntcode, then just return the empty list.pli lipotherwise, just figure out the position in the data file, jump right into that position, and read data from there.pli ul  pMy difficulty is that codedropcode is not implemented in the same way as codecountcode, codefirstcode, codeseqcode, etc. The latter functions call a similarly named static method in codeRTcode which, in turn, calls my implementation above, while the former, codedropcode, does not check if the instance of the sequence it is being called on provides a custom implementation.p  pObviously, I could provide a function named anything but codedropcode that does exactly what I want, but that would force other people including my future self to remember to use it instead of codedropcode every single time, which sucks.p  h3So, the question is strongis it possible to override the default behaviour of codedropcodestrongh3  h24. A workaround I dislikeh2  pWhile writing this question, Ive just figured out a possible workaround make the reading even lazier. The custom sequence would just keep an index and postpone the reading operation, that would happen only when codefirstcode was called. The problem is that Id need some mutable state the first call to codefirstcode would cause some data to be read into a cache, all the subsequent calls would return data from this cache. There would be a similar logic on codenextcode if theres a cache, just codenextcode it otherwise, dont bother populating it  it will be done when codefirstcode is called again.p  pThis would avoid unnecessary disk reads. However, this is still less than optimal  it is still On, and it could easily be O1.p  pAnyways, I dont like this workaround, and my question is still open. Any thoughtsp  pThanks.p

I discovered this by running this getorders function with the parseordersresult commented out, and it completes each iteration of the do while loop in 3 seconds. However, when I run the parsing stuff, it takes the 30 seconds I mentioned below.

Negative 31481 pIve encountered this in a couple spots in my appp  pLets assume I have 3 items in a carousel. Im viewing item 2. I need to reload that carousel, so I do the following operationsp  precodeExt.getCmpcarouselname.removeAll var newobjects  bunch of code that recreates the carousels objects again, with the same IDs this is the same code that was used to create the objects the first time, so it is likely not the issue Ext.getCmpcarouselname.addnewobjects codepre  pIn the carousel object items list codeExt.getCmpcarouselname.getItemscode, all three items exist. However, only 1 and 3 the ones which werent the active item prior to the carousel reload actually appear. 2 presents a blank white screen, and in the HTML nothing exists except for the item shell markup no code that Ive written shows up. If I do codeExt.getCmpcarouselitem2.showcode, the item does appear, but is fullscreen, and I get the errorp  precode[DEPRECATE][Ext.Panelshow] Call show on a component that doesnt currently belong to any container. Please add it to the the Viewport first, i.e Ext.Viewport.addcomponent codepre  pWhen I try to manually add that item to either the Viewport or the carousel, nothing is fixed.p  pIve tried inserting a dummy item inbetween removal and reinsertion of new items, that doesnt work.

Nor does doing codeExt.getCmpexercisescarousel.eachfunctionitem item.destroy code rather than coderemoveAlltruecodep  pI dont believe the issue is the code snippet that recreates the new items, since its the same code thats used to create the items the first time, and there are no issues on the first creation.p  pPretty stumped here.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ive found that if, when I get to the end of the carousel, if I add a empty item after the last item in the carousel, I dont get the blank item at N2.

Negative 31481 pIm having trouble using a Scroller to scroll a ScrollView programmatically, so no touch gestures are involved in this so far. I want to scroll the ScrollView down at a certain speed, as long as data from a sensor is in a certain range. So basically I want to start scrolling the first time the data enters the valid range and then not disturb the scrolling process until the data is out of the range again.

Negative 31481 pEDIT Indeed, I had a weird error in my timing code leading to these results. When I fixed my error, the smart version ended up faster as expected. My timing code looked like thisp  precodebool x  false before  now for int i0 iltN i    x  smartxorA[i],B[i]  after  now codepre  pI had done the codecode to discourage my compiler from optimizing the forloop away. But I think that the codecode somehow interacts strangely with the two xor functions. I changed my timing code to simply fill out an array of the xor results, and then do computation with that array outside of the timed code. And that fixed things.p  pShould I delete this questionp  pEND EDITp  pI defined two C functions as followsp  precodebool smartxorbool a, bool b    return ab   bool dumbxorbool a, bool b    return abb  codepre  pMy timing tests indicate that codedumbxorcode is slightly faster 1.31ns vs 1.90ns when inlined, 1.92ns vs 2.21ns when not inlined.

Negative 31481 pIm having some problems with apparently getting wrong results from codepthreadgetspecificcode in a library thats designed to link into various iOS apps.p  pI see that a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationcocoaConceptualMultithreadingCreatingThreadsCreatingThreads.htmlApple writesap  blockquote   pCocoa and POSIX store the thread dictionary in different ways, so you cannot mix and match calls to the two technologies. As long as you stick with one technology inside your thread code, however, the end results should be similar. In Cocoa, you use the threadDictionary method of an NSThread object to retrieve an NSMutableDictionary object, to which you can add any keys required by your thread. In POSIX, you use the pthreadsetspecific and pthreadgetspecific functions to set and get the keys and values of your thread. p blockquote  pDoes that mean that emneitherem the Cocoa nor POSIX TLS functions can be expected to work in library code when we dont know whether the code that calls us is already using one or the otherp  pHow does one get to store and retrieve a threadlocal pointer robustly in these circumstancesp  pIs there a native Darwin TLS support API we should be using instead of either Cocoa or POSIXp

Id like to implement a solution that will fairly share the load, or even just roundrobin between the queued users.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions or insights into how I might implement a solution to this p  pI thought routingkeys might help but if User As jobs are queued before User B adds their jobs then they still wont be processed until User As jobs have been consumed p  pI have also thought of creating a queue for each user amp jobtype but I am unsure how to do this dynamically   Perhaps I need to implement some sort of control queue that sets up queues and dynamically adjusts the worker processes to consume the newly added user only queue, but would the worker collect the jobs from the queues in a roundrobin type way  And how would I decide when to remove the queues p  pthanks in advance for any help p

This is strange, because codeplayerapi video.csszoom, resetcode does. So something is specifically strange with the elements style width and height. We can see this by looking furtherp  pFrom the emcontent scriptem I must set codeplayerapi video.get0.style.width  1920pxcode or use codevideo  playerapi video.get0code and set the codevideo.style.widthcode. This is because codeplayerapi videocode has no style property.

Negative 31481 pUsing Grunt I was wondering if there were some existing build process to precompile serverside templates. Actually with usual template engines, you often use features like include, extend layout.html, ...br This means you could be able to just precompile your template doing all stuff that can be  statically solve. For example with a hrefhttpectjs.com relnofollowecta and the include featurep  ul lia.ectli ul  pcodeltdivgtHello Im lt name gtltdivgtlt include b.ect gtcodep  ul lib.ectli ul  pcodeltdivgtIm included in a.ectltdivgtcodep  pSince there is no conditional dynamic statement to decide if the emb.ectem block has to be included, ema.ectem could be statically compiled including emb.ectem into em.dista.ectembrp  pcodeltdivgtHello Im lt name gtltdivgtltdivgtIm included in a.ectltdivgtcodep  pAs you can see, em.dista.ectem is still a template, and the name variable stills need to be  provided, so in this case, this part remains unchanged. However, the inclusion is static so it can be done right now avoiding the useless inclusion strongat runtimestrong even with a cachep  pUsing this approach, we could even think about minifying templates during this build process, and more. For the minifying task, I am aware of tools like htmlmin but this is oriented for valid html.p  pIve also found some grunt tasks a hrefhttpsnpmjs.orgpackagegruntect relnofollowgruntecta, a hrefhttpsnpmjs.orgpackagegruntcontribjade relnofollowgruntcontribjadea, etc which compiles your templates into html by providing the context. However it seems that it expects to get all the dynamic parts of your templates i.e. the value of all variables.p  pAny idea if this kind of emprecompilationem tool already exists for a template engine even without gruntp  pPS This could be a bad approach, so any advice is welcome.p

Negative 31481 pOn my website, there is a registration form. After having filled this in, the user gets redirected to Azure ACS in order to log in. After having logged in, the user gets redirected back to my website and is to be registered and logged in.p  pThe registration forms information is saved in a cookie before the user is transferred to ACS, in order to be read when the user returns. Azure might suddenly change server instance for my webrole, and it seems the cookie cannot be read in those cases. Since the user gets transferred to ACS, it seems I cannot store the registration information in a session. I think I need to use cookies. Is there any way to make the same cookie readable between different Azure instances Or is there a better solution Thanks for any help.p

Negative 31481 pI have a Q.Widget with thousands of checkboxes that get data from a database and send data back to it once a save button is pressed. p  pWhen the save button is clicked, due to the huge amount of data that is being sent to the database, the application goes not responding until the transaction is terminated which is a normal behavior since PySide QT locks everything until the callback function ends.  However I find this behavior unprofessional. p  pWhat I want to do is to lock everything so no modifications can be done to the state of the checkboxes during the query but without the application going in no responding mode. p  pI have thought of running the query in a separate thread and displaying a Q.MessageBox which automatically locks the Q.Widget that is closed only when the query ends but Im wondering if there is any way to lock the Q.Widget without displaying a message box and displaying a status message at the status bar of the window instead or as a last resort just locking the Q.Widget no need for a message to be displayed in the status bar without having it to go in not responding mode.p  pAlso, setting all the checkboxes to disabled is not an acceptable option.p  pSystem configuration p  ul liWindows 7 64bitsli liPython 3.3 installed through windows installerli liPySide module 1.2.1 installed through windows installer Database li liPostgresSQL 9.3.1 installed through windows installerEntrepriseDBli lipsycopg2 module for communication with the database installed through windows installerli liPython editor  PyCharm Community Edition 3.0.2 installed through windows installerli ul

Negative 31481 pI am currently in the process of reengineering a system which is written in struts 1.3  PostgreSQL and Hibernate.p  pThe system is architectured as an MVC system with presentation logic in JSPs  Actions having View Logic and EJBs having Business logic. p  pThey have used Hibernate as a mapping layer,but some areas still use JDBC functions which have large number of business logic written inside themp  pThe system has about 800k lines of code. p  pThough the initial idea had been to have only view based logics in action classes and JSPs, there is huge amount of business logic also in the Actions and JSPs. p  pThe database columns are having ambiguous  and duplicated columns as with each requirement, the columns have just been added. This has a nasty effect on the application when picking data, the same data item in two different reports may show different values.p  pThere are no JUnit test cases and documentation is moderate.p  pIn some areas I have managed to remove the business logic out of JSPs  Action tier and bring them to EJB tier.p  pHowever my question is where would be the ideal place to start the refactoring,p  pis it first refactoring the code in JSPs  Actions then move to EJBs for reengineering logics and finally move to DBp  pOr is to start from the DB, refactor the DB then come up the stackp  pIs start at the enterprise business logic layer and refactor the business logicp  pWhere should I start and what should my approach be. I am now going through Martin Fowlers books and lot of articles on refactoring and reengineering. But I would really appreciate some guidance.p

Negative 31481 pFor a university project I need to implement a computer graphics paper that has been relased a couple of years ago. At one point, I need to triangulate the results I get from my simulation. I guess its easier to explain what I need looking at a picture contained within the paperp  pimg srchttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu2500073triangulation.PNG altp  pLets say I already have got all the information it takes to reconstruct the contour lines that you can see in the second thumbnail. Using those I need to do some triangulation using those siluettes as constrains. I have searched the internet for triangulation libraries like CGAL, VTK, Triangle, Triangle, ... but I always ended up throwing my hands up in horror. I am not a good programmer and it seems impossible to me to get into one of those APIs before the deadline of this project passes.p  pI would appreciate any kind of help like code snipplets, tips, etc...p  pI know that the algorithms need segments pairs of points as input, so lets say I have got one stdvector containing all pairs of points defining the siluette as well as the left and right side of the rectangle.p  pCan you somehow give me a code snipplet for i.e. CGAL that I could use for my purpose First of all I just want to achieve the state of the third thumbnail. Lateron I will have to do some displacement within the cracks and finally write the information into a VBO for OpenGL rendering.p  hr  pI have started working it out with CGAL. One simple problem still drives me crazyp  pIt is possible to attach informations like ints to points before adding them up to the triangulator object. I do this since I need on the one hand an intflag that I use lateron to define my texture coordinates and on the other hand an index which I use so that I can create a indexed VBO. a hrefhttpdoc.cgal.orglatestTriangulation2Triangulation22infoinsertwithpairiterator28cppexample.html relnofollowhttpdoc.cgal.orglatestTriangulation2Triangulation22infoinsertwithpairiterator28cppexample.htmlap  pBut instead of points I only want to insert constraintedges.

Negative 31481 pI want to have a table schema where two columns share the same pool of values. For example a table with two columns codefoocode and codebarcode which contain integers shouldnt have the same number twice in both columns. It does work with only one column codeCREATE TABLE test foo INT UNIQUEcode but not with multiple columns.p  pFor example I have the following SQL statements, all except the first should fail, because they use integers which are already present in one of the two columnsp  precodesqlitegt CREATE TABLE test foo INTEGER NOT NULL , bar INTEGER DEFAULT NULL sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES42, 47 sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES47, 42 sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES47, 74 sqlitegt INSERT INTO testfoo VALUES42 codepre  pMarking two columns unique doesnt work for me, as this only checks if the combination of both values is already present so only the third insertions fails.p  precodesqlitegt CREATE TABLE test foo INTEGER NOT NULL , bar INTEGER DEFAULT NULL, UNIQUEfoo, bar sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES42, 47 sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES47, 42 sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES42, 47 Error columns foo, bar are not unique sqlitegt INSERT INTO testfoo VALUES42 codepre  pMarking each column unique doesnt help either, as both columns should share the same pool of values.p  precodesqlitegt CREATE TABLE test foo INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE, bar INTEGER DEFAULT NULL UNIQUE sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES 42, 47 sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES 42, 47 Error column bar is not unique sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES 42, 74 Error column foo is not unique sqlitegt INSERT INTO test VALUES 47, 42 codepre  pThis is closer to my target than the combined version because it fails with the third insertion, but it is not exactly what I need.p  pIm asking for this, because I want to save the numbers of hardware ports.

Negative 31481 pI read an example from an older StackOverflow post about when to use stackalloc. Now this example has me a bit puzzledp  precodepublic unsafe void DoSomeStuff      byte unmanaged  stackalloc byte[100]     byte[] managed  new byte[100]      Do stuff with the arrays      When this method exits, the unmanaged array gets immediately destroyed.     The managed array no longer has any handles to it, so it will get      cleaned up the next time the garbage collector runs.     In the meantime, it is still consuming memory and adding to the list of crap     the garbage collector needs to keep track of. If youre doing XNA dev on the     Xbox 360, this can be especially bad.  codepre  pNow feel free to correct me if Im wrong, as Im still quite a novice in C and programming in general. But arent bytes value types And arent value types stored where they are declared Doesnt this mean that in this example, codemanagedcode is also stored on the stack, and by extension when this stack frame finishes and it goes to the calling adress the memory is cleaned up automatically and therefore codemanagedcode should be removed in the same manner as codeunmanagedcode in this examplep

Negative 31481 pI have poured over numerous questions and answers but cant seem to find a solution that works for me. Here is what I am trying to dop  pSay I have table called Store that holds Store IDs, store names, and the annual sales of that store. The business wants each store to increase its sales by 50 over the next year, and wants to calculate monthly target sales amounts that each store needs to reach to make the 50 increase value. For example, if store number 5 had 1000 in sales last year, the target for the end of the next year would be 1500. And to reach that, the amount for each month would need to be something like 1042, 1084, 1126... 1500.p  pWhat I am trying to do is insert 12 records for each store into a monthly plan fact table. I am trying to select a store from the Store table, grab the annual sales amount, then do a loop inside that where I calculate what each month value would be so I can insert it into the monthly plan fact table, then select the next store from the store table... and so on. As a C developer, it seems a very simple task that could be accomplished with a for each style loop with another for loop inside it.p  pBut I cannot for the life of me figure out how to do this in SQL. I know about temp tables, but I cant seem to figure out how to get multiple rows inserted into my monthly plan fact table using the records from the Store table, and the values calculated in the loop to determine the monthly plan values. Ive read some on cursors, but it seems that most people advise against them in the SQL community, so I am at a loss on this one.p

They all happen to require the same set of source files an encryption library written in C and Ive added a static library target for them and it seems to be able to compile them just fine.p  pMy issue is that Im working on one of the executables and in trying to link with that library, I keep getting the ld symbols not found for architecture x8664 error. Ive already compiled the library and added it to Target Dependencies, Link Binary with Libraries, and Copy Headers or the relevant header anyway in the build phases settings for the target in question. Xcode lets me include the library just encryption.h but again the build fails. Any suggestions Im rather new to C development with Xcode so I could be missing something glaringly obvious.p

Negative 31481 pI was wondering if there are any BDDstyle describeit unittesting frameworks for Python that are maintained and production ready. I have found a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypidescribe0.1.2 relnofollowdescribea, but it doesnt seem to be maintained and has no documentation. Ive also found a hrefhttpfalcao.itsure relnofollowsurea which reached 1.0, but it seems to just add syntactic sugar instead of writing assertions. What Im really looking for is something similar to RSpec and Jasmine that enables me to setup test suites. The describeit syntax that allows for testing multiple cases of a function. Versus a classical assertion structure that tests each function once and has multiple assertions for testing multiple cases. This breaks the isolation of a unit test. If theres a way to achieve something similar with the assertionstyle testing Id appreciate any advice on how to do it.

Since you can dynamically add rows after the page loads, occasionally this record wont be found in the database. p  pWhen the user clicks on the Delete link, an codeajaxcode function is called to remove the record from the database. As long as the function serverside function does not crash, the operation will send back as a success. p  pOnce the codeajaxcode functions codesuccesscode function is called, I would like to remove the codetrcode from the table. p  pI can do this with each row that exists in the table once the page loads. The codeajaxcode function sends the proper info back to the server, and the codetrcode is removed from the table. However for each codetrcode I add after the codedeletecode codeajaxcode function will not fire, and the codetrcode is left on the page. p  pstrongViewstrongp  precode        ltfieldsetgt             ltlegendgtAgent Idsltlegendgt             lttable idagentTablegt                 lttheadgt                     lttrgt                         ltthgtState Codeltthgt                         ltthgtCompany Codeltthgt                         ltthgtAgent IDltthgt                         ltthgtNonRes Biz NYltthgt                         ltthgtltthgt                         ltthgtltthgt                     lttrgt                lttheadgt                 lttbodygt                     foreach var item in Model.BankListAgentIds                                              Html.PartialAgentIdPartial, item                                      lttbodygt                 lta hrefjavascriptvoid0 class addCodegtAdd Anotherltagt             lttablegt         ltfieldsetgt codepre  pstrongParial Viewstrongp  precodemodel CollectionItemTest.Models.BankListAgentId      Layout  null  using Html.BeginCollectionItemBankListAgentIds      Html.HiddenFormodel gt model.TableId     Html.HiddenFormodel gt model.BankID     lttrgt         lttdgt             Html.EditorFormodel gt model.StateCode         lttdgt         lttdgt             Html.EditorFormodel gt model.CompanyCode         lttdgt         lttdgt             Html.EditorFormodel gt model.NonResBizNY         lttdgt         lttdgt             Html.EditorFormodel gt model.AgentId         lttdgt          lttdgt             Html.ActionLinkDelete, , ,  new  href  javascriptvoid0, id  Model.TableId           lttdgt                                   lttrgt      codepre  pstrongjQuerystrongp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function          agentTable.onclick, tr a, functione              .ajax                 url Url.ActionDeleteRow, BankList,                 data  id this.attrid ,                 dataType html,                 cache false,                 context this,                 success function                       this.parentstr.remove                                                 document.readyfunction           .addCode.clickfunction              .ajax                 url Url.ActionBlankRow, BankList,                 dataType html,                 cache false,                 success functionhtml                      agentTable gt tbody.appendhtml                                             ltscriptgt codepre  pstrongController Functionsstrongp  precode    public JsonResult DeleteRowint id              if id  0 return null          var agent  from a in db.BankListAgentIds                      where a.TableId  id                      select a.FirstOrDefault          if agent  null return JsonAgent Id not found, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet          db.BankListAgentIds.Removeagent          return null           public ViewResult BlankRow              return ViewAgentIdPartial, new BankListAgentId      codepre

Negative 31481 pEclipse Luna finally has this great split editor and I am having trouble figuring out how to make our editor work as expected with the new feature. We have our own custom editor and it doesnt behave like the Java editor in Luna when it is split.

Whereas with the Java editor the update happens in real time with every character. I would like our editor to update with each character without saving like the Java editor does.p  pI thought I could create a new Eclipse editor plugin to see if that behaved like the Java editor, but unfortunately it acts like our custom editor. p  pI have done some Google searching, but have not been able to find anything on this specific topic. In fact, I could not find anything that explains exactly how the split editor works.

The Intel PLatform is being detected on just a normal OPENCL code  without mexplatforms 1,Devices 1. But on using the OPenCL with Mex, OpenCl fails to recognize the Intel Platform  platforms found 0 , error 1001.p  pJust by including the MEX part of the code the number of platforms shown is zero. I am using matlab Compile runtime MCR to compile the mex files.p  pmake p  precodempicxx fPIC Loptintelopencl1.24.4.0.117lib64 LusrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev83binglnxa64 test.cpp o test lOpenCL IusrincludeCL  lmat lmx lmex IusrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev83externinclude Wl,rpath,optintelopencl1.24.4.0.117lib64,rpath,usrlocalMATLABMATLABCompilerRuntimev83binglnxa64 codepre  pIs there some problem with the way I am linking the files p

Negative 31481 pIn Jasper Reports, can you accumulate a variable a double calculation  Sum of Field codeFadrcode, a double based on the value of a different field codeFhcecode, a stringp  pI have triedp  precodeFhce  Y  Fadr  0 codepre  pI thought I had used this capability in JR b4, but I cant make it work now.

Negative 31481 pIt probably has been asked before but I come across this situation time and time again, that I want store a very small amont of properties that I am absolutely certain will never ever exceed say 20 keys.  It seems a complete waste of CPU and memory to use a HashMap with all the overhead to begin with, but also the bad performance calculating an advanced hash value for each key lookup. If there are only lt20 keys probably more like 5 most of the time. I am absolutely certain that calculating a hash value takes hundred times more time than just iterating and comparing ...nop  pThere is this talk about premature optimization, but I dont totally agree here. I am on Android mostly, and any extra CPUmemory will opt for more juice for other stuff. Not necessarily talking about the consumer market here. The usecase here is very welldefined and doesnt change much, furthermore it would be trivial to replace a very cheap map with a HashMap in case something that will never happen there will be a very large amount of new keys suddenly.p  pSo, my question is which is the very cheapest, most basic Map I can use in Javap
Negative 31481 pIve already read several threads about this problem but I got another strange misbehaviorp  pIve created a ViewPager that has an initial Page count of 5. If the page count2 is reached, p  precodepagerAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged codepre  pgets called. The fragments all get their own id, counting up from 1. So the first fragment got the number one, second one the number two and so on. Each fragment loads an image out of a webserver, depending on their idp  precodewebView.loadUrlhttpmyserver  id  .jpg codepre  pNow it appears, that sometimes the images are larger than the devices screen width. Thats why I added these linesp  precodewebView.getSettings.setLoadWithOverviewModetrue webView.getSettings.setUseWideViewPorttrue codepre  pThe first 5 elements seem fitted perfectly, but when trying to swipe to the next fragment, youve got to first swipe the webview about 3px to the left, after that swipe again, to get to the next fragment.  I dont know why this is happening , but after the initial 5 images, it works correctly. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that in the beginning I tell the pageradapter that there are 5 fragments to show, and after scrolling more fragments are added. These following fragments are not affected by this problem.  This was the first problem.p  pThe second problem is, when swiping through the completely correctly shown images, sometimes an image wil not be fitted to the screen. Ive got to turn the screen to landscape and back to portrait, only then the image is fitted correctly. How can this happen, why does it work when the screen gets redrawn, but not on the first try And it only appears to happen sometimes.p  pThese are my two problems, the first one with the minimal wron fitting of the first 5 fragments and the second one the sometimes nonfitting images when swiping, but fit when screen gets redrawnp  pHeres my main activityp  precodepublic class MyActivity extends ActionBarActivity   public static int NUMPAGES  5  private ViewPager viewPager private CustomPagerAdapter pagerAdapter  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymy      viewPager  ViewPagerfindViewByIdR.id.activitymyviewpager      pagerAdapter  new CustomPagerAdaptergetSupportFragmentManager     viewPager.setAdapterpagerAdapter     viewPager.setOnPageChangeListenernew ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener          Override         public void onPageScrolledint i, float v, int i2                     Override         public void onPageSelectedint i              ifNUMPAGES  i lt 2                  NUMPAGES3                          pagerAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged                   Override         public void onPageScrollStateChangedint i                   private class CustomPagerAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter      public CustomPagerAdapterFragmentManager fm          superfm           Override     public Fragment getItemint position          return ScreenFragment.createposition           Override     public int getCount          return NUMPAGES        codepre  pAnd heres the fragment classp  precodepublic class ScreenFragment extends Fragment   public static final String ARGPAGE  ARGPAGE  private int pageNumber  public static ScreenFragment createint pageNumber      ScreenFragment fragment  new ScreenFragment     Bundle args  new Bundle     args.putIntARGPAGE, pageNumber     fragment.setArgumentsargs     return fragment   Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     pageNumber  getArguments.getIntARGPAGE1   Override public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, Nullable ViewGroup container, Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState      ViewGroup viewGroup  ViewGroupinflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentscreen, container, false     WebView webView  WebViewviewGroup.findViewByIdR.id.fragmentscreenwebview     webView.setWebViewClientnew WebViewClient     webView.getSettings.setLoadWithOverviewModetrue     webView.getSettings.setUseWideViewPorttrue     webView.loadUrlhttpsomeserver  Integer.toStringnumber  .jpg     return viewGroup   codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 31481 pAs I dont know javascript at all, Im wondering if its possible to insert some SSI into javascript in a PHP file. Ive got a bit of script going to preload some images, and Id like to set it up so that some images always get preloaded across my entire site via the SSI of which I may add to over time, while allowing me to add individual images as needed page by page. It works fine in my HTML files, but not it my PHP files.p  pHeres what Ive got in my HTML files which works just fine p  precodeltscriptgt     function preloadarrayOfImages          arrayOfImages.eachfunction               ltimggt[0].src  this                   preload[         ltinclude virtualgrabbagpreloadimages.html gt         imagesimage1.png,         imagesimage2.png     ] ltscriptgt codepre  pBut this doesnt work in my PHP files, the SSI getting replaced with nothing but empty textp  precodeltscriptgt     function preloadarrayOfImages          arrayOfImages.eachfunction               ltimggt[0].src  this                   preload[         ltphp includegrabbagpreloadimages.php gt         imagesimage1.png,         imagesimage2.png     ] ltscriptgt codepre  pIs this possible Thanks in advance.p

Negative 31481 pBack in previous versions of Django, we all used South to do migrations, and because it wasnt as smart as we might have liked, we sometimes needed to tell it to explicitly ignore some fields because such fields were too complicated for it to handle.  We did this with codeaddignoredfieldscode and everything pretty much worked.p  pIn our case, we have a field on our model thats a subclass of codeCharFieldcode that actually attaches two additional fields to the model via the codecontributetoclasscode method.  Its kind of a weird process, but it makes sense for our use case and worked just fine until we upgraded to Django 1.7.p  pHowever, with the new migrations system, our use of codeaddignoredfieldscode no longer works and our unit tests are exploding as it tries to create a test database table with these fields.  Specifically it saysp  precodedjango.db.utils.OperationalError duplicate column name ourcolumnname codepre  pIn this case codeourcolumnnamecode is one of the fields this special CharField subclass creates.p  pIn a perfect world, we could have the migration code handle these fields properly, but Id settle for the 1.7 version of codeaddignoredfieldscode if it exists.p  pI should also point out that weve found a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevtopicsmigrationscustomdeconstructmethod relnofollowthe explanation for codedeconstructcodea in the Django documentation, but Im afraid that it doesnt make any sense to me.

Negative 31481 pSo i am trying to build one factor models with stocks and indices in R. I have 30 stocks and 16 indices in total. They are all time series from 201311 to 20141231. Well at least all my stocks are. All of my indices are missing some entries here and there. For example, all of my stocks data have the length of 522 but one indice has a length of 250, one 300, another 400 etc. But they all start from 201311 and end at 20141231. Because my indice data has holes in it, i cant check correlations and build linear models with them. I cant do anything basically. So i need to fill these holes. I am thinking about filling those holes with their mean. But i dont know how to do it.I am open to other ideas of course. Can you help me It is an important term project for me, so there is a lot on the line...p

Negative 31481 pI need help with parsing the Apple receipt verification response sandbox.

Negative 31481 pIm using Spring mvc with LDAP authentication against active directory. What I have now works but my contextSource  properties url, managerDN, and managerPassword are hard coded. Id like to move these properties into my server.xml as a resource and use a datasource to specify these connection settings.

Negative 31481 pIn Java, a set only checks for equality of an object with objects already in the set only at insertion time.

Negative 31481 pIn my game, I have one menu at the bottom of the game scene and it contains 5 buttons. Clicking on each button causes a side panel to eject out from the side of the game that is from left to right. I had used iTween to give the effect when the side panel pops to the screen, when the bottom menu button is clicked. This is done on earlier version of unity 4.5. Yesterday, I upgraded my unity to the latest version of 4.6. I found that now the ui elements such as buttons etc are now moved and positioned using Rect Transform instead of normal Transform. What I found difficult is that, in my code, I had used iTween like thisp  precodepublic var SidePanelOptionsToScreen function Start        SidePanelOptionsToScreen iTween.Hashx, 10, easeType, easeOutBounce, loopType, none, delay, .02  function MoveTweenSidePanelGameObject      iTween.MoveToSidePanel,SidePanelOptionsToScreen  codepre  pThe problem is that earlier, I used to move the game object from x0. This was the transform position of X in the game scene. But when I run the same code on the unity 4.6, the value of the sam panel is now at PosX 800. When I tween the same side panel using the abouve iTween code, the side panel moves from 800 to 520.8572. That mean the side panel moved about 279 instead of 10. Hodoes that happen Because of this, the entire UI whihc I had now created in 4.5 Unity now looks unordered when run in devices after coding it in new unity 4.6. Can some one help in the iTween. MoveTo function for using to move in the rect transform of buttons in the new unity 4.6.p  pA little help from some one is easily appreciated. Thanks in advance..p

Negative 31481 pIve got a ViewPager that has 2 Gridviews in it. I use a FragmentStatePagerAdapter for the ViewPager and the gridviews each have a GridViewAdapter.

Negative 31481 pI am designing application with Onion architecture and I would like to use grid from Kendo UI with server side filtering sorting and paging. I would like to avoid manually parsing DataSourceRequest into dynamic LinQ, but use ToDataSourceResult instead. p  pI came to the working solution, where my controller contains followingp  precode    private ISalesService salesService      public HomeControllerISalesService salesService              this.salesService  salesService           public JsonResult Post[DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request              var sales  salesService.GetQueryableSales          return Jsonsales , JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet        codepre  pISalesService is maped to implementation where I use repository, with following codep  precode    public IQueryableltSalesOrderHeadergt GetQueryableSales              if context  null              context  new AdventureWorks2012Context          return context.SalesOrderHeaders      codepre  pThis is just a skeleton of application, so there is no logic in service nor repository. This way I can avoid manually parsing DataSourceRequest, but at a cost of exposing IQueryable to MVC layer. I would like to keep IQueryable inside repository and expose IEnumerable if possible, or maybe DataSourceResult from Kendo UI library.p  pI tried to change my repository call as followingp  precode    public DataSourceResult GetSalesDataSourceRequest request              using var c  new AdventureWorks2012Context                      var headersQuery  c.SalesOrderHeaders              var result  headersQuery.ToDataSourceResultrequest              return result               codepre  pThis way I could keep IQueryabl inside repository and still use automatic DataSourceRequest transformation into dynamic LinQ provided by Kendo UI. But this would required to reference Kendo.Mvc and System.Web.Mvc from my data layer, which does not seem as a good choice either.p  pSo my question is, whether is it possible to automatically convert DataSourceRequest to LinQ, without compromising application layering Am I missing something in Kendo UI architecture Or I have to choose either to parse DataSourceRequest manually or compromise my architecture to some pointp

Negative 31481 pWe are trying to apply jersey 1.19 to our application were stuck with older java and weblogic so we cant migrate to jersey 2.X and have come across a weird problem. Whenever we make a request, the default response header is codeapplicationjsoncharsetISO88591code, even though Ive declared codeProducesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSONcode which by default should have codecharsetutf8code. This of course makes the data unreadable in the client. When I tried to force the character encoding into UTF8 using codeProducesMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON charsetutf8code the response header is correct however jersey seems to be adding extra characters at the end that make it impossible to decode the response text into an object in javascript. When I make a direct call to my web service I get thisp  blockquote   psuccesstrue,data[id1,description,id2,description   ],messageType0,total0p blockquote  pBecause we are using ExtJS, there is no way to code.normalizecode the response text before parsing it because extjs stores do this automatically and there is no event to catch the response before it tries to convert it to an object. I really cant understand why this is happening. I even tried jersey 1.18 thinking it might be some bug they had with 1.19 but I get the exact same behavior.p

Negative 31481 pI used sqlite3 on my Mac to create a small database file surnamed .db containing one table, plus the androidmetadata table containing enUS.  I pasted the file into the assets folder of my Android Studio project.  At runtime, the onCreate method of my SQLiteOpenHelper copies the file into datadataprojectnamedatabasesfilename.db on my Genymotion emulator a Samsung Galaxy S5.  But when I try to read the table in filename.db with the Cursor provided by the getReadableDatabase method of the SQLiteOpenHelper, I get the LogCat error ESQLiteLog 1 no such table tablename.  The same thing happens on my elcheapo Azpen A727 Android tablet.p  pThe filename.db file copied into the datadataprojectnamedatabases folder on the emulator contains the same number of bytes 5120 as the original filename.db I created on my Mac with sqlite3.  When I compare the two .db files with the Unix octal dump command od c, I found that they are identical for the first 16 bytes, and differ for the first time at the 17th byte.  The original file has octal 004 as its seventeenth byte, and the copy has 020.  Should the two files have had identical contents  When I try to examine datadataprojectnamedatabasesfilename.db with sqlite3 .dump, I get ERROR 11 database disk image is malformed.p  pThe getReadableDatabase method of my SQLiteOpenHelper triggers a call to the onCreate method of the helper.  In onCreate, I copy filename.db from the assets folder to the datadataprojectnamedatabases directory.  At the end of onCreate, I verified that the 17th byte in both copies of filename.db is 004.p  pI added an onOpen method to my SQLiteOpenHelper.  It is called automatically by getReadableDatabase after onCreate, and does nothing except calling super.onOpen.  After calling super.onOpen, my onOpen prints the 17th byte of both copies of filename.db.  The byte in assets remains 004, but the byte in datadataprojectnamedatabases has become 020.  The damage also occurs if onOpen does not call super.onOpen.p  pWhat sinister force might be damaging datadataprojectnamedatabasesfilename.db between the end of the call to onCreate and the start of the call to onOpen  Or is the problem something else entirely  Thank you very much.p  precodepackage edu.nyu.scps.offer  import android.content.Context import android.content.res.AssetManager import android.database.Cursor import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper import android.util.Log  import java.io.FileInputStream import java.io.FileOutputStream import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStream import java.io.OutputStream  public class Helper extends SQLiteOpenHelper      private static final String DBNAME  offers.db     private Context context      public HelperContext context          supercontext, context.getDatabasePathDBNAME.getPath, null, 1         this.context  context           Override     public void onCreateSQLiteDatabase db          try              AssetManager assetManager  context.getAssets             InputStream inputStream  assetManager.openDBNAME in assets folder             OutputStream outputStream  new FileOutputStreamgetDatabaseName              byte[] buffer  new byte[1024]             int length              while length  inputStream.readbuffer gt 0                  outputStream.writebuffer, 0, length                           outputStream.flush             outputStream.close             inputStream.close          catch IOException exception              Log.emyTag, exception   exception                    Override     public void onUpgradeSQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion        codepre  pHere is a .dump of the file I created by hand using sqlite3p  precodesqlite3 offers.db .dump PRAGMA foreignkeysOFF BEGIN TRANSACTION CREATE TABLE androidmetadata          locale text default enUS  INSERT INTO androidmetadata VALUESenUS CREATE TABLE offers      id integer primary key autoincrement,     title text,     description text  INSERT INTO offers VALUES1,Prewar Castle,It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania.

DELETE FROM sqlitesequence INSERT INTO sqlitesequence VALUESoffers,10 COMMIT codepre  pApril 15, 2015 I discovered why my .db file was corrupted.  When the getReadableDatabase method of class SQLiteOpenHelper called onCreate, the .db file had already been created and was even in the middle of a database transaction.  The code in my onCreate overwrote this file completely.  At some later time the SQLiteOpenHelper attempted to complete the transaction, but the .db file with which it started the transaction has been destroyed.  Solution the .db file must be copied from the projects assets embeforeem getReadableDatabase is called.  The most straightforward approach would be to copy it in the constructor for my subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper.  But Androids documentation says that SQLiteOpenHelpers constructor must return very quickly and defer the creation of the .db file to getReadableDatabase.  So I ended up overriding getReadableDatabase with a new method that copies the .db file and then calls the getReadableDatabase of the superclass SQLiteOpenHelper.  super.getReadableDatabase will not attempt to create a new .db file if it finds the file already in existence.  Details omitted. I debugged my original code only because I was curious to know why it corrupted the .db file.  In real life Im going to use SQLiteAssetHelper, and I am grateful for the suggestion.p

Negative 31481 pIm new to the concept of object oriented programming in java and I often encounter the following design problemp  pI often create classes with instance variables which are not known at the moment of initialization. These variables are filled over time. This is not a real problem since these variables are null until they are filled, my question therefore is more about the best practice in such situations.p  pLet me explain it with an example. I have a class codeCarcode. Every codeCarcode has a codecolorcode, codevMaxcode, codeweightcode, codehorsepowercode etc. p  pWhen initializing the codeCarcode only its codecolorcode, codeweightcode and codehorsepowercode are known.  codeCarcolor, weight, horsepowercodep  pThe codevMaxcode can now be calculated lets say codeweighthorsepowercode. What confuses me is, that the codeCarcode, after initialization is incomplete, meaning that the codevMaxcode will only be filled over time.p  pI found this quite ugly, and of course the carexample is simplified. I often have classes with 10 properties where some are calculated over time, which themselves later in the code are used to calculate even more properties of that object. It then becomes difficult to know which variables are already filled at a certain point and which are not.p  pI just wondered whether this is normal and the way OOP works, or whether such situations should be avoided. If yes, Id be glad for some designhints.p  pMichaelp

The heap allocation happens in codeNodeManager.initcode.p  pHeres the code.p  precodeclass Node  public     int index   class NodeManager  public     NodeManager      void initNodeNode b              b  new Node           Node node   int main      NodeManager manager     manager.initNodemanager.node      cout ltlt manager.node ltlt endl prints a bad pointer      systempause     return 0  codepre  pOf course, when I change codeinitNodecode top  precodevoid initNode      thisgtnode  new Node  codepre  pthe codemanagercode object actually remembers its codenodecodes address. The problem is that in the first code, the address isnt remembered and the application prints out a bad address. Why is thatp  pEdit To make things clearer, Im working with a class that has a data member that is a pointer to an object. My class has a recursive member function that takes its data member pointer as a starting point parameter and keeps calling itself to allocate and create the objects children too. But then, I get this problem. the private data member isnt remembered and turns out to be NULL or a bad pointer after all.p

Negative 31481 pI am working with MVC, jQuery, and jQuery Validate plugin.p  pI am having problem with using jQuery Validate on set of fields that when validated can be visible or not.p  pIf customer selects coderadiobuttoncode that he has additional address, postcode field is being shown. This field has required validator on it that works just fine. However when user enters postcode he has to click codeFind Addresscode button and then ajax call is being made and addresses for that postcode are shown. Then user has to click on address and it gets selected. p  pProblems that I am having p  ol lipWhen user enters postcode and submits the form without clicking codeFind Addresscode validation passes because required validation is passed.pli lipWhen user enters postcode and clicks codeFind Addresscode but does not choose address from the list and submits the form validation is passed.pli ol  pThere are non visible fields to which address is being populated so I could unignore those specific fields to be validated by removing then from ignore list p  precodeignore hidden, hiddennotHiddenAddressFields codepre  pbut this is conditional so in validation method that I would register withp  precode.validator.addMethodmainAddressValidator, function     ...  codepre  pI would have to do logic that would be checking should these fields be validated, plus this might cause side effects and list of hidden fields is long. Another reason I dont like this is since we are using bundling this would leak to all other pages.p  pstrongIs there a way to plug in standalone function that would return codeboolcode and would be called in JQuery form validation pipeline that would not depend on elements being visible or anything for that matterstrongp  pstrongHTMLstrong not that I think this helps but someone will ask for it

Negative 31481 pIve been working on a HTML5based scientific image browser, for local or remoteserver use.  Among other things I want to be able to distribute imageshtml5 to my college classes.  However, I have encountered the crosssite security restrictions on canvas content, which I was astounded to find applies to purely local files as well.  Yes, I have a server, but I want students to generate their own content, and use my tools to view it.p  pThe answers I have seen to date encourage starting a local PC server so users can use http instead of file, or browserspecific workarounds modifying browser security settings, launching the browser differently, or using browserspecific directives, all of which are lousy to me from the standpoint of distributing images and later data with jshtml5 code to interrogate the data.p  pI hope someone more knowledgeable can tell me if there is another way, because this seems nearly a show stopper, assuming users could be on varied platforms using any of a number of html5savvy browsers.p

Negative 31481 pI am building a Java application on the Equinox OSGi framework and I have been using DS declarative services to declare referenced and provided services. So far all the service consumers I have implemented happened to be service providers as well, so it was natural for me to make them stateless so that they can be reused by multiple consumers, rather than being attached to one consumer and let them be instantiated by the framework default constructor, invoked nowhere in my code.p  pNow I have a different situation I have a class codeMyClasscode that references a service codeMyServicecode but is not itself a service provider. I need to be able to instantiate codeMyClasscode myself, rather than letting the OSGi framework instantiate it. I would then want the framework to pass the existing codeMyServicecode instance to the codeMyClasscode instances. Something like thisp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class MyClass       private String myString     private int myInt      private MyService myService      public MyClassString myString, int myInt          this.myString  myString         this.myInt myInt            bind     private void setMyServiceMyService myService          this.myService  myService            unbind     private void unsetMyServiceMyService myService          this.myService  null           public void doStuff          if myService  null              myService.doTheStuff          else               Some fallback mechanism                 codepre  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic class AnotherClass       public void doSomethingString myString, int myInt          MyClass myClass  new MyClassmyString, myInt           At this point I would want the OSGi framework to invoke          the setMyService method of myClass with an instance of          MyService, if available.          myClass.doStuff        codepre  pMy first attempt was to use DS to create a component definition for codeMyClasscode and reference codeMyServicecode from therep  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltscrcomponent xmlnsscrhttpwww.osgi.orgxmlnsscrv1.1.0 nameMy Classgt     ltimplementation classmy.package.MyClassgt     ltreference bindsetMyService cardinality0..1 interfacemy.other.package.MyService nameMyService policystatic unbindunsetMyServicegt ltscrcomponentgt codepre  pHowever, codeMyClasscode is not really a component, since I dont want its lifecycle to be managed  I want to take care of instantiation myself. As a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers318921neilbartlettNeil Bartletta points out a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8887216285091hereap  blockquote   pFor example you could say that your component depends on a   particular service, in which case the component will only be created   and activated when that service is available  and also it will be   destroyed when the service becomes unavailable.p blockquote  pThis is not what I want. I want the binding without the lifecycle management.

Negative 31481 pHello I am building a game in swift Xcode 6 and very new to programming. I have a home screen view controller that when the screen is tapped it segues to the first level of the game this is fine and when The game is lost the game over view controller is segued to but then when I tap the screen and return to the first level game view controller the fps is down to 30 and when the game is lost and segued to the game over view controller the fps is at 25 and this continues to when the game becomes to slow to play. The code i use is the performSegueWIthIdentifier function,  it works fine but I think the game gets slower because multiple views are being created  Also if I score 8 points the game automatically calls the performSegueWIthIdentifier to go to the second level view controller but when I actually do score 8 points it seems the segue is called twice and the second level view controller appears twice one right after another. Could any one help me figure out a solution  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 31481 pI have a large SQL query for a report with many optional parameters and 2030 branches in the WHERE clause. The problem is its running very slow. The execution time varies from 6 secs to 5 mins. If I remove one or two conditions it works in 6 secs but with all conditions it takes over 5 mins. The problem is not with any specific indexes or a condition because if I remove ANY ONE condition from the query it improves. There are about 20 tables in the join and about 100 fields in the output. Problem area of the query looks something like this p  precode        AND AbcID IN SELECT  FROM fnSplitAbcIDs, ,         AND XyxID IN SELECT  FROM fnSplitXyzIds, ,         AND AaaID IN SELECT  FROM fnSplitAaaIds, ,         AND ZzzID IN SELECT  FROM fnSplitZzzIds, , codepre  pwhere fnSplit is a udf. Also note if I remove fnsplit with hardcoded value 1,2,3,4,5 it also improves. But my guess is the issue is to do with the server memory or some configuration rather than in an specific clause in the WHERE. As I said earlier there are 2030 branches in the WHERE clause and removing any one condition improves the performance a lot. p  pAny thoughtsp

Example when showing a logged in userss friends, we need the first 20 results, then on the following click, the next 20 results, etc.. We dont really care about the order, provided we dont get repeated data for the following queries. We prefer to use sets vs sorted sets, as sets lets us use cheap SINTER for other queries.

It would just appear out of nothing at the moment the scroll function triggers without any effects. So if I remove the CSS the fade infade out works. How to combine both portions of code so that when the element fades in, it fades only to codeopacity 0.6code and then stops. When hovered it should have codeopacity 1code and still being able to fade out when out of the range of the scroll function. I think there must be a CSS only way, with jQuery just adding the classes when the function activates... But I havent figured it out yet...p

Negative 31481 pI need some help to improve the architecture of a site Ive built. What I want to achieve within a single Django project is the followingp  ul liI want a site that comes in several emversionsem one per year, such that each version has a set of apps that are related to that version.li lipI want to keep all the old versions of the site and the state of the apps in that version, but still being able to addchangeremove the apps for any other version. That is, the apps may be different across versions models, methods, admin, templates, anything basically.pli lipI want each app that belongs to a version to have the data for that version only. App1 on version 2012 should have one database table, and App1 on version 2013 should have another, even if they are the same.pli ul  pIt could look something like thisp  precodesite.com2012     App1v1     App2v1  site.com2013     App1v1     App2v2 maybe added some fields or methods, changed templates  site.com2014     App1v2     App2v2     App3v1 codepre  pMy current solution is rather horrible. When a new version of the site is launched, I simply copypaste an earlier app and have the old app be as it is, and then addingmodifying the new version of the app. But, as I add more apps and more versions come, I get a stupid amount of apps and it feels like bad design.p  pHow can I achieve this in Django in a better way Or at least, how can I structure it in a better way I think about having some base model for each app, from which each version then inherits from, but that still makes a lot of apps.p  pAs an example of an app I have, it may look like thisp  pstrongApp name Appv12012strongp  pModelp  precodeclass Bagmodels.Model     name  models.CharField  class Itemmodels.Model     name  models.CharField     inbag  models.ForeignKeyBag codepre  pViewp  precodeclass IndexViewgeneric.ListView     model  Bag     templatename  sometemplate2012.html codepre  pstrongApp name Appv12013strongp  pModelp  precodeclass Bagmodels.Model     name  models.CharField  class Itemmodels.Model     name  models.CharField     inbag  models.ForeignKeyBag codepre  pViewp  precodeclass IndexViewgeneric.ListView     model  Bag     templatename  sometemplate2013.html codepre  pstrongApp name Appv22014strongp  pModelp  precodeclass Bagmodels.Model     bagname  models.CharField     owner  models.ForeignKeyUser  class Itemmodels.Model     name  models.CharField     inbag  models.ForeignKeyBag codepre  pViewp  precodeclass IndexViewgeneric.ListView     model  Bag     templatename  sometemplate2014.html codepre  pAs you can see, my biggest problem is the violation of the DRY principle.

Negative 31481 pThe following is a simplification of an iterator Im using on an codestdtuplecode. In it, I define a templated type in one namespace, and use it in a second one, such as followsp  precodenamespace meta     templateltsizetgt struct metasizet         namespace ns      templateltsizetgt struct nssizet            template ltsizet Ngt      void barmetametasizetltNgt           barmetametasizetltN1gt           void barmetametasizetlt1gt       templateltsizet Ngt      void foo           barmetametasizetltNgt         int mainvoid     nsfoolt5gt        return 0  codepre  pThe code compiles fine in MSVC2015, but fails in g 4.8 and clang 3.5 stdc11 by reaching the maximum recursion depth for templates. Note that if codemetametasizetcode is replaced with codenssizetcode  and the definition of codenssizetcode is uncommented, then everything works fine.p  pI surmise that the compiler is delaying the resolution of codemetametasizetcode until its done resolving codebarcode since its in another namespace or something along these lines, and is thus failing, but Im unsure about how to tackle this issue.p  pUnder what conditions does this problem generally arise Is there any way of forcing the compiler to resolve codenamespace metascode contents before codensscode Id like to avoid duplicating the type definition as exemplified with codenssizetcode.p  pstrongFurther Contextstrong In the original code, codebarcode has a codestdtuplecode parameter, and makes a call to an overloaded function using codestdgetltNgttuplecode p  pstrongEditstrong Noobish mistake. After looking at the example provided by WhozCraig, I verified that the code could be fixed by swapping the order of the two codebarcode methods I presume that g and clang search for definitions sequentially, and thus never get to registering the second overload of bar, whereas MSVC must add all the definitions to its symbol table before continuing. Does the standard specify one approach or the other, or is this implementation specific That said, I dont get why this isnt a problem if the definitions arent inside a namespace. p

Negative 31481 pIm designing a game and have a problem with countdowntimer not stopping. The timer starts normally as it should, and should stop in the end method.
