My codecomponent1.module.jscode will list dependencies that module requires and so on. Now, I realize that it sort of doesnt matter where I define module dependencies and that I can put all my dependant module, regardless of component in the codeapp.module.jscode file, but thats simply not clean nor does it offer good modularity.p  pThat being said, Im not sure what to do with modules that are used in every, or almost every other module, like modules for localization for example. The real problem here isnt that the whole app uses that module, its that that universal module needs to be configured, so I was thinking about putting that dependency, and the required configuration, in the codecore.module.jscode and codecore.config.jscode file, respectively.p  pIve read a lot about angular best practices, but I wasnt able to find something concerning module dependency organization which, I suppose, is because angular puts all the modules in a big box anyway.p  pAnother approach would be to create a shared component that focuses on incorporating that particular dependency, or group of dependencies into angular, and then have my other components depend on that component, but Im not sure if this is too much.p

If I encapsulate lowerlevel logic within method calls then it leaves the code reflecting higherlevel logic. This makes the code easier to understand because it requires less of the developers mental resources to get a general concept of what each part of the code does.p  pMy goal here is to eliminate the reader from actually having to analyze the implementations details of the code here unless its absolutely necessary. So instead of having to read through an entire method to comprehend it, the reader can instead get a more abstract representation of the logic of my code. p

Positive 3054 pI have a collection of about a dozen structured things of a type Ive defined say codeComponentcode, each of which can be identified by a name, and am struggling to sort out an idiomatic Haskell way of instantiating and retrieving them. These things are used frequently in my application, so conceptually they are a set of global constants or a table of constants, that ideally would be initialized and saved for fast retrieval. p  pMy current approach, which Im uncomfortable with, just uses a function to compute each codeComponentcode from its name. p  precodedata Component  Component                      someData  String,                     otherData  [Int]                   deriving Show  component  Name gt Component component n  case n of      about a dozen in the application     1       gt Component lasdkfjalksdjfalkf [1]     Q       gt Component nvjufhhqwe [5,10,11]     other   gt Component ugugugu []     A       gt Component alkkjsfkjaleifuhqiweufjc []     B       gt Component randomletters []     C       gt Component nothingimportant [9,10]     b       gt Component uk []     c       gt Component x [4,2,7,9,0]             gt Component ABC []      if not listed above, the Component is computed     otherwise gt Component someFunctionOf n someOtherFunctionOf n codepre  pThis doesnt feel right to me. For one thing, the codeComponentcodes name is really a part of the codeComponentcode, but isnt included in the type. More importantly, even constant values get computed, when in fact they should just be initialized in some table.p  pWith this in mind Ive also triedp  precodetype Name  String  import Data.Maybe import Data.Map  data Component  Component                      name  Name,                     someDate  String,                     otherData  [Int]                   deriving Show  components  fromList  c gt name c, c ltgt [     Component 1 lasdkfjalksdjfalkf [1],     Component Q nvjufhhqwe [5,10,11],     Component other ugugugu [],     Component A alkkjsfkjaleifuhqiweufjc [],     Component B randomletters [],     Component C nothingimportant [9,10],     Component b uk [],     Component c x [4,2,7,9,0],     Component  ABC []     ]  component  Name gt Component component n  isNothing c  Component n someFunctionOf n someOtherFunctionOf n               otherwise    fromJust c           where c  Data.Map.lookup n components codepre  pThis has the advantage of clearly treating the constant values as constants, but feels awkward, since it introduces an intermediate value the codeMapcode codecomponentscode and duplicates the name there in the codeComponentcode and as the corresponding key.p  pAnyway, I feel like Im going about this all wrong, and that there must be a better way to set up an indexed set of structured values, that include a bunch of constants as well as computed ones.p

Negative 3054 pIm programming a java application that reads strictly text files .txt.  These files can contain upwards of 120,000 words. p  pThe application needs to store all 120,000 words. It needs to name them word1, word2, etc. And it also needs to access these words to perform various methods on them.p  pThe methods all have to do with Strings.

The tools that are there are not quite right.p      pFor example, when you add things to a table and it numbers them, that means you cant have a second machine also adding to them because the numbers will collide. So what do you do You have to come up with some completely different way to do it.p      pDo you have a central server that hands out number sets, or do you come up with something thats not numbers Do you use random numbers and hope they never collide Whatever it is, autoassigned IDs just dont fly.p blockquote  pHas anyone here faced this problem What are ways to move beyond autoincremented IDs, or is there a way to have them scale with multiple serversp

Negative 3054 pIm merging a couple of .xml files together, and need to take certain child elements from each .xml document and put them into a 3rd.  And thats OK, but the problem is that then my child nodes are in a somewhat random order well, what I picked from the first file, followed by what I picked from the 2nd, and the schema file the .xsd defines these children as a sequence or codexssequencecode if you prefer.  So the output file then doesnt pass validation anymore because while each file had its elements in order, the resulting file does not.p  pWhat Im wondering, is that since I have the .xsd, and I have a mostly valid .xml file, is there any way in C to move all the nodes into the correct order according to the order defined in the .xsd without a lot of pain  Obviously I could implement a kind of sort but Im hoping theres something builtin.  Or better yet, a builtin merge that does this automatically could also work.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 3054 pIm evaluating a number of different algorithms whose job is to predict the probability of an event occurring.p  pI am testing the algorithms on largeish datasets.  I measure their effectiveness using Root Mean Squared Error, which is the square root of the sum of the errors squared.  The error is the difference between the predicted probability a floating point value between 0 and 1 and the actual outcome either 0.0 or 1.0.p  pSo I know the RMSE, and also the number of samples that the algorithm was tested on.p  pThe problem is that sometimes the RMSE values are quite close to eachother, and I need a way to determine whether the difference between them is just chance, or if it represents an actual difference in performance.p  pIdeally, for a given pair of RMSE values, Id like to know what the probability is that one is really better than the other, so that I can use this probability as a threshold of significance.p

Negative 3054 pI have a table with two child tables. For each record in the parent table, I want one and only one record in one of the child tables  not one in each, not none. How to I define thatp  pHeres the backstory. Feel free to criticize this implementation, but please answer the question above, because this isnt the only time Ive encountered itp  pI have a database that holds data pertaining to user surveys. It was originally designed with one authentication method for starting a survey. Since then, requirements have changed, and now there are two different ways someone could sign on to start a survey.p  pOriginally I captured the authentication token in a column in the survey table. Since requirements changed, there are three other bits of data that I want to capture in authentication. So for each record in the survey table, Im either going to have one token, or a set of three. All four of these are of different types, so my thought was, instead of having four columns where either one is going to be null, or three are going to be null  or even worse, a bad mashup of either of those scenarios , I would have two child tables, one for holding the single authentication token, the other for holding the three. Problem is, I dont know offhand how to define that in DDL. p  pIm using MySQL, so maybe theres a feature that MySQL doesnt implement that lets me do this. p

I am new to the iPhone Application development scene. p  pAim of the project is to have a custom interactive User Interface UI on top of Movie Player objects .mov files on device. The underlying FullScreen MoviePlayers can be more than one and need to switch to different ones based on user Interaction.p  pI am using cocos2D to achieve the custom interactive UI and effects for e.g. particle effects on swipe gesture. And I am using Multiple codeMPMoviePlayerViewControllercode to play the resident movie files .mov on fullscreen mode refered to MoviePlayer sample.p  pRequirement is to switch between movies by switching between default and alternate moviePlayer upon touch detection. Also, the switching should be as smooth as possible.p  pTo achieve smooth switching I am using two codemoviePlayerViewControllerscode, each a subview of codeUIViewcode object in AppController. p  pProblem a I am not sure if this is the right way to achieve movie switching.p  pProblem b In my current solution. The Default codeMoviePlayercode is rotated in portrait mode, and sometimes the moviePlayer object is not visible. The behaviour is not consistent.p  pProblem c The Alternate movie player object of codeMPMoviePlayerViewControllercode and added first as subview of UIWindow rotates on device rotation and behaves properly the Default Movie Player object of codeMPMoviePlayerViewControllercode added after doesnt. Cant think of logical explanation of it.

Negative 3054 pI have an interesting problem. I have to assign an ID to a group of orders, based on whether they are packed in the same group of containers or not. One order may be in one or many containers, which means that not all containers in the group contain all the orders.

Notice that ORDER1 and ORDER3 do not share any containers.p  pI can think of a reasonably straightforward procedural algorithm for doing this grouping  getting the details right might be a bit painful though.p  pHowever, I like to have an SQL based solution if possible, but its beyond my grasp.

Negative 3054 pAgainst the advice of one of my buddies, I installed the Visual Studio 2010 SP1 beta on my dev box at work. Or rather, I tried to. I used the web installer, but halfway through the install it failed. p  pWhen I try to uninstall or repair it, I keep getting dialogs saying that different files arent available and I need to insert various CDs. Trying to do a fresh install from the ISO version yields the same result.p  pAny suggestionsp  pJoshp  pEdit Im running Windows 7 64 bit. The files seem to be different every time I try to repair or uninstall the SP, but last time the dialog was asking me to insert the visual studio 2010 prerequisites disk. Another time it was complaining about the F runtime. Ill try again and post a few specific file names, but I dont think the files are the issue so much as the botched install.p

Negative 3054 pI am using Rails 2.3.4p  pI am looking less for a specific answer to this question, but more for general guidance in this matter.p  pIn our MySQL database, we encrypt personally identifiable information PII, such as name, address, phone number, etc. But I get requests for dynamic queries all the time. p  pFor example, Can you query the db to get me the entry values for a given date, but only for users in a list of area codes.p  pSo, the selection criteria include some of the PII encrypted data, such as area code of their phone number.p  pFor this discussion, the User and Entry tables have the following fields of interestp  pUser.id,User.phonep  pEntry.userid,Entry.value,Entry.createdatp  pBecause of encryption, I cant connect a SQL client and do my query the easy way to get all the entries on 11212010 from users in a list of area codes 555,222,333, something like thisp  pSELECT E.value,SUBSTRU.phone,2,3    FROM users U INNER JOIN entries E ON E.userid  U.id    WHERE DATEE.sentat  20101121       AND SUBSTRU.phone,2,3 in 555,222,333p  pId like to do in the console a query that might give me similar data.p  pIt appears that the encrypted fields cannot be used as selection criteria, so Im guessing that they are not decrypted until it is time to display them rather than query them.p  pMy brute force painful way was the following multistep processp  ol liselect ALL the ids and area codes of ALL active users.    User.allselect  id, phone,conditions  [stateactive]li liDo a screen grab of the terminal, li licopy to a text editor, massage, li lipaste into excel, li liuse excel filter to grab user ids of only the desired area codes,li lipaste them into a flat file, massage into a commaseparated list, and then li lipaste into my SQL client to query by userid SELECT  FROM entries WHERE userid IN  and datecreatedat  .li ol  pTheres got to be a better way Any suggestions Thanks in advance,p

Negative 3054 pOn a linux system, I have built my own tunneling protocol, where I relay packets over a nonstandarized but verfied medium. What I do is capture the packets using iptables and NFQUEUE, relay them over my medium, and at the other end I reinject them using raw sockets. The packet going into the tunnel is exactly the same as the one coming out, verified. The problem is that this doesnt work for ICMP Ping Echo Request if the destination of the ping is the same as the tunnel endpoint.  If the destination is not the same as the tunnel endpoint, the ping packet is rerouted and arrives as it should at the receiver, and the ping reply comes back to the sender.

Negative 3054 pWhat would be best mechanism, for achieving ability, for users, that are logged in, receive messages, generated by server. As there is no way for a server, to send information to user, when it has new message to deliver, a user browser should poll with some specific interval, to receive in response new messages, additionally, there should be a way for server, to not send messages, that are already delivered to user. You could draw a connections with something like public chat mechanism, but the thing I need is message delay as close to realtime and ability to handle about 100 users simultaniously, making least traffic possible. Additional note data is needed only when user is online, no need to store that data in server, for other users to read history.p  pIn my mind, there are one way of achieving this  global message box where server puts all messages, user browser is constantly polling the server, to check, if last received message ID is equal to last message ID in message box.p  pThe question is, if this is right way to do that, or there are another ways for such tasks, as need for realtime data can be found everywhere sensor data, multiplayer games, chat, stock market and more...p

Negative 3054 pI am maintaining a legacy app full of RPC style web services. For example, we have the following services for creating and deleting users from the systemp  ul lia hrefhttpsexample.comcreateUser relnofollowhttpsexample.comcreateUserali lia hrefhttpsexample.comdeleteUser relnofollowhttpsexample.comdeleteUserali ul  pClients call these services by submitting XML data over an HTTP POST. The XML request contains all the information necessary for the server to process the request i.e. authentication information, user information. The server then responds with an XML document containing any information the client should be aware of e.g. successfailure flags and descriptions.p  pI am interested in what the benefits are in switching these RPC style services to a more RESTful architecture. From what Ive read, that would mean the followingp  ol liTo create users, clients would still be required to submit XML data over HTTP POST or PUT depending on whether they know the final URL and if they know all the necessary information for a user resource. However, authentication information would be passed in the HTTP headers using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBasicaccessauthentication relnofollowbasic authenticationa.li liTo delete users, clients would issue an HTTP DELETE call to a hrefhttpsexample.comusers relnofollowhttpsexample.comusersauser id. Again, authentication information would be passed in the HTTP headers rather than in the request body. In fact, no request body should be necessary as far as I can tell.li liRather than indicating success  failure information in an XML document, the server should try to indicate as much as possible via the HTTP status code  status description.li ol  pNow as far as I can tell, the main benefits of changing these services to a more RESTful architecture arep  ol liWed be leveraging more of what HTTP has to offer, specifically in regards to authentication.li liThe URLs are a bit more logical, especially if we need to start exposing resources beneath the user level e.g. a hrefhttpsexample.comusers relnofollowhttpsexample.comusersauser idstuff.li liIts more inline with the native architecture of the Web.li ol  pAm I missing anything I feel like there should be more benefits to going with a RESTful architecture.p  pNote that when I say RPC style I am not referring to a standardized format like XMLRPC or SOAP.p

Negative 3054 h2Bahh2  pI have recently installed the MiniProfiler from a hrefhttpcode.google.compmvcminiprofiler relnofollowhttpcode.google.compmvcminiprofilera attempting to find all the slow calls on my site. There are quite a few. But Ive fixed a lot of it as a result of the profilerp  pThere were two common calls that I noticed were being reported by the profiler to take over a second to return in some cases. This didnt make any sense. The profiler showed the call in mvc itself to take around 24ms but the overall call took over 1 second. I spent quite a bit of time trying to narrow down the problem.p  pI noticed that the subsequent ajax calls are always instant but those were on delayed loads and the initial call times seemed to always grow from the initial page load so I decided to check in firebug and IEs firebug equivalent and the reported times are the same. I decided then to delay the calls made by the page by about 10ms using a codesetTimeoutcode. Suddenly the calls are exactly what they should be in terms of how long they take to complete. Note the actual calls are instant but the reported times arentp  pI can not figure out why this is happening. Ive tried to reproduce it using a new project and attempting to duplicate the behavior but alas, all is well in the new project. My initial thoughts were that the initial ajax calls were using the same connection due to the keep alive header, however, all the responses returned with Closed on the keep alive so Im not sure that is the case.p  h2Here are the results from the different servicesh2  h3Mini Profilerh3  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comimERZ.png altMini profiler resultsp  h3Firebugh3  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSC2e0.png altfirebug resultsp  h3IEs firebugh3  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtTDii.png altie resultsp  pemNote that Im fairly certain the difference between the page results and the first call are a result of the images being loaded for the page.emp  h2Javascript Helper functionh2  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function LoadJsonurl, callback, error          .ajax             url url,             type POST,             dataType json,             success function ret                  callbackret             ,             error function ret                  alerturl                            ltscriptgt codepre  h2Actual callh2  precodefunction       LoadJsonajaxactiveform, function ret          Do something       codepre  pAny help in understanding this would be appreciated.

It seems like Coldfusion does not offer this ability. p  pHowever, I think it would be cool if there was a way to specify an attribute in your input tags that had the data type of the field. Then, it would be uber nice if Coldfusion stuck it into a struct for you with your field names. p  pIs there anyway to accomplish this or can someone elaborate on the most efficient way to do serverside validationp

Negative 3054 pOK... Im developing an iPad app with using a split view. My detail view contains a map with markers on it and the root view is a table view.p  pMy data is split up into 4 arrays, and I need to be able to toggle between displaying these 4 arrays with a button. The markers displayed on the map and the data in the table view need to both change to display only the array chosen. This is easy on the map side of things since the NIB for the detail view file allows me to easily add buttons and execute functions from them. But... That doesnt help me for the table data in my root view controller, especially since the root view is, well, the root view, and is above the detail view. Its easy to pass functions from the root view to the detail view, but not vice versa, plus that seems to be the wrong way to do things.p  pI imagine that I might need a custom object to contain a variable to let the program know which array to display. That doesnt seem too difficult, but... If thats the case, it seems like I need to create some kind of delegate to cue a function in the root and detail view every time the variable inside my custom object is changed. Does anyone have any ideas how I might be able to do thisp  pstrongBasically, I need a kind of global variable that can be changed with the press of a button and will cue functions in both views every time the variable changes. The trick is that this button is in a subview.strongp  pThis is my first question on StackOverflow so I apologize if its poorly written or if Ive left out too many details... Please let me know if there are any questions. I could really, really use the help because Im quite stuck.

Negative 3054 h2Backgroundh2  pOne problem with games using online highscore lists is that they often can be abused. The game sends the current score to the server and a cunning user can analyze the protocolscheme and send bogus scores. That is why some highscore lists are topped with 999999 scores.p  pA common solution to this problem is to encrypt the score in some way, and on top of that put a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25999secureonlinehighscorelistsfornonwebgames145450145450other mechanisms to recognize false scoresa. But even if you do this, its the client that sends the score and the client is living in the users computer and can be reverseengineered.p  h2My ideah2  pI am designingthinking about a game that I will complete, yeah right   where you configure your playerrobot with instructions on how to perform a task and emwhenem these instructions are to be carried out. When a Go button is pressed the game runs the instructions. Finally a result and, if successful, a score, is obtained.p  pSo, how about this Instead of submitting the score, emthe actual instructions are sent to the serverem, where they are run, using the same implementation. Then emthe server calculates the scoreem and places the user on the highscore list.p  h2The questionh2  pstrongAre there ways this idea can be abused to get a false scorestrongp  pI understand that this probably is not a new idea. But if it works, it wouldnt be impossible to extend it to other games too, where it is possible to record all user actions. p

Then I click the remote control, code[FWAudioPlayer remoteControlReceivedWithEvent]code is never called. Then I tried to receive the remote control event in the AppDelegate. If it can receive the event in the AppDelegate and I can dispatch the event handling and call the singleton class. However, it seems itll never be called in the AppDelegate.p  pSo Id like to know what is the problem here.My guess is that the singleton class codeFWAudioPlayercode is not a really codeUIViewControllercode as it is not under the view hierarchy of the app. Moreover, when app leaves to other pages like main page, the codeMainViewControllercode is the first responder and codeFWAudioPlayercode can never get the remote event.p  pIf Im right, how can I implement a music player with the same function like iPod music,especially having background playing and remote control p  pIf my guess is wrong, how to make itthe singleton class  to receive the remote eventp  pThanksp
Negative 3054 pIt is very common to use codeincludecode files. I think it is overused to keep the codes tidy without considering performance. For several codeincludecodes, disk should read the files, and as we extremely use disk, it can be a slow process. However, this is not the main slow process or the ratelimiting process, as loading the file with codefilegetcontentscode is few times faster.p  pI think this is the reason that major websites put javascripts within the html file rather than loading them by file. Alternatively, it can be a good idea to split a large JS file into several small JS files, as parallel http requests can load the entire JS codes faster. But this is different from php files, as php script reads codeincludecode files one by one during the process.p  ol lipPlease comment how much serious this problem can be Imagine a webpage is loaded in 0.60s, can codeincludecode of 10 php files turn it to 0.70spli lipAlthough this effect should be negligible, I want to know if there are approaches to speed up this process.

But, when I register a new phpBB user account, phpBB doesnt create the user account in LDAP at the same time. So I need to manually create the same usernames account at LDAP side, then the user account can login phpBB system. Im using openldap on an ubuntu serverp  pMy question is, does phpBB 3.0.9 fully support LDAP createreadupdatedelete user account at LDAP or phpBB 3.0.9 only supports reading LDAP information onlyp  por should I install another extra thirdparty plugin for accessing LDAP in phpBB systemp  pThanksp

Negative 3054 pLets say I have two tables, codepeoplecode and codefamiliescode.p  pcodefamiliescode has two fields  codeidcode and codenamecode. The codenamecode field contains the family surname.p  pcodepeoplecode has three fields  codeidcode, codefamilyidcode and codenamecode  The codefamilyidcode is the id of the family that that person belongs to. The  codenamecode field is that persons first name.p  pIts basically a one to many relationship with one family having many people.p  pI want to get a lists of name sets, ordered by the highest occurrence of the largest set of names across families.p  pThat probably doesnt make much sense...p  pTo explain what I want further, we can score each set of names. The score is the array size  number of occurrences across families.p  pFor example, lets say two names, John and Jane both existed in three families  That sets score would be 23  6.p  pHow could I get an array of sets of names, and the sets score, ordered by each sets scorep  pSample Result Set Ive put it in a table layout, but this could be a multidimensional array in PHP  Note this is just randomly thought up and doesnt reflect any statistical name data.p  precodenames               occurrences  score Ben, Lucy           4            8 Jane, John          3            6 James, Rosie, Jack  2            6 Charlie, Jane       2            4 codepre  pJust to clarify, Im not interested in sets wherep  ul liThe number of occurrences is 1 obviously, just one family.li liThe set size is 1 just a common name.li ul  pI hope I have explained my somewhat complex problem  if anyone needs clarification please say.p

Negative 3054 pIve been looking into the OData standard and would like to update my services to provide this standard and to consume it. I know that for the XML, it uses the ATOM XML standard so the names of the elements, such as id, title, author, etc. must be that exactly  conform to the Atom standard. The JSON format for OData has different names for their elements. Are those required to be that way or can I have my JSON structure use the same names for its elements as the Atom XML structure p  pAn example is the link  in Atom its called link, with an href and rel attribute. The JSON name for this element is metadata with the key being uri. It seems like those names are standard and cant change. Im wondering if the root elements, metadata, resource, etc. are standard, but maybe the internal elements maybe more flexible. Like the title element for the Atom corresponds to the name element in the JSON structure, could I keep the JSON structure to use title instead of namep

Appreciate your help in advance.p  pThe setup  p  pI have three view controllers a table view controller, a first view controller and a second view controller.  The table view controller has a new button and table cells. The new button is connected to an addStuff segue, and the table cell to an editStuff segue to the first view controller. The first view controller is similarly set up with two buttons connected to the second view controller via segues addMoreStuff and editMoreStuff. There are two entities stuff and moreStuff set up in the model with custom subclasses of NSManaged Object. There is a onetoone relationship, with inverse. The moreStuff relationship from Stuff, and the stuff relationship from MoreStuff.p  pThere are delegate methods to return from second view controller to the first view controller.p  precodevoidsecondViewControllerSecondViewController controller didAddMoreStuffMoreStuff moreStuff voidsecondViewControllerSecondViewController controller didEditMoreStuffMoreStuff moreStuff codepre  pEssentially there are textFields in the first and second view controllers.

Negative 3054 pI have a fairly simple servlet application running under Glassfish 3.1.1 with a Derby 10.5.3.0 database.  I have created a security realm using JPA annotations and am able to login successfully.   My problem comes when I then try and access the Users entity.  JPAHibernate seems to be repeatedly reading  the user table until it throws a StackOverflowError exception.  I have tried commenting out the login code, but I still get the exceptions when trying to access the user table, so Im pretty sure that the fault must be with my JPA annotiactions.

Negative 3054 pI have a Visual Studio package that does some of its work by starting an external process using codeSystem.Diagnostics.Processcode and communicating with it over standard inputoutput. Currently, I have the path to the code.execode hardcoded which is obviously not workable for actually deploying the extension. What is the right way to package and distribute the code.execode with the extension And, related, once I have done so, how do I programmatically discover the path to the installed code.execode file. Preferably I would like to put it into the code.vsixcode file so installation is easy.p  pstrongEDITstrong I have placed the relevant part of my code on BitBucket it may be useful to someone else using Roslyn a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgperelmanroslynprocess relnofollowroslynprocessa in order to give a better idea of what I am trying to do. This code sets up communication between a Visual Studio extension using an implementation of codeAbstractProcessHandlercode and a separate process using codeRoslynProcesscode. The latter is kept informed of modifications to the code files in Visual Studio and which code file is being viewed, so it is able to do analysis with uptodate information despite not running as a Visual Studio extension which would impose the limitations of Roslyn on all code being edited.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong Using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma92477891124792this answera, I can get the directory of the extension. I can include another package in codesource.extension.vsixmanifestcode by adding it to the content list as type Custom Extension Type. Then the code.execode appears in the extensions directory. This seems like its probably the right solution although the way of getting the directory is labeled in MSDN as something I shouldnt be using.p  pIt seems like this might be the best way to do this even though it seems hackish, in which case Ill post this as an answer once I get everything working.p
Negative 3054 pFollowind describes an issue I am running into using EF 4.2 and LINQ.  Ive tried this on multiple systems, and multiple flavors of SQL SQL Express and SQL 2008 R2 Sp1, VS 2010 Pro and Premium, both in 64 bit and 32 binaries, both with the debugger, and attempting to run the binary directly.  Im wondering what Ive stumbled against, if its an issue with EF, or more likely an issue with my code and Im missing some nuance either related to LINQ or EF.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, been at it for 6 hours, my Google JuJu is not strong enough Im afraid.p  pI have a simple model named session consisting of an ID Guid, Name String, and Timestamp DateTime.  I am able to add a session to the dbcontext, and have verified in debugging that the session record is indeed stored in the database.  The timestamp used to create the session object is stored in a local variable, and immediately after storing, I attempt to retrieve the session into a new instance of a session object.  The code that retrieves the session LINQ throws System.InvalidOperationException Sequence contains no elements with the following stacktracep  precodeat System.Linq.Enumerable.First[TSource]IEnumerable1 source at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.ltGetElementFunctiongtb0[TResult]IEnumerable1 sequence at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.ExecuteSingle[TResult]IEnumerable1 query, Expression queryRoot at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.System.Linq.IQueryProvider.Execute[S]Expression expression at System.Data.Entity.Internal.Linq.DbQueryProvider.Execute[TResult]Expression expression at System.Linq.Queryable.First[TSource]IQueryable1 source at efwtf.Program.MainString[] args in dvs2010efwtfefwtfProgram.csline 19 at System.AppDomain.nExecuteAssemblyRuntimeAssembly assembly, String[] args at System.AppDomain.ExecuteAssemblyString assemblyFile, Evidence assemblySecurity, String[] args at Microsoft.VisualStudio.HostingProcess.HostProc.RunUsersAssembly at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStartContextObject state at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean ignoreSyncCtx at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart codepre  pI am able to drill into ctx.Sessions in the debugger and see in the resultset that the session that I am trying to retrieve actually does exist, and if I iterate over the result set and manually compare the two timestamps I can extract the session as expected.  If I run the code and pass a timestamp value for a record that was added to the database in a previous run, it works.  I can find work arounds, worst case, changing the datatype to a string perhaps, but it bugs me that this doesnt work, Im assuming, which may be part of the problem, that the functionality should be supported.

So far I managed to open an L2CAP socket, but this socket has endless retransmissions and Im trying to change it. I want to have no retransmissions at all because I need the data to be transfer fast with minimal delay and the reliability of the data is not important.p  pI found an example online that deals with changing the flush timout for the socket and by that causing that if a packet is not acked after a certain period of time it is dropped and the next data in the buffer is sent. The problem is that this example doesnt work p  pHere is my code, this method is called after the bind commandp  pcode         int setflushtimeoutbdaddrt ba, int timeout                  int err  0, dd, devid         struct hciconninforeq cr  0         struct hcirequest rq   0 p  precode    struct          uint16t handle         uint16t flushtimeout      cmdparam      struct          uint8t  status         uint16t handle      cmdresponse       find the connection handle to the specified bluetooth device     cr  struct hciconninforeq malloc                 sizeofstruct hciconninforeq                  sizeofstruct hciconninfo     bacpy ampcrgtbdaddr, ba      crgttype  ACLLINK     devid  hcigetroute NULL     dd  hciopendev devid      if dd lt 0           err  dd         goto cleanup           err  ioctldd, HCIGETCONNINFO, unsigned long cr      if err  goto cleanup       build a command packet to send to the bluetooth microcontroller     cmdparam.handle  crgtconninfogthandle     cmdparam.flushtimeout  htobstimeout     rq.ogf  OGFHOSTCTL     rq.ocf  0x28     rq.cparam  ampcmdparam     rq.clen  sizeofcmdparam     rq.rparam  ampcmdresponse     rq.rlen  sizeofcmdresponse     rq.event  EVTCMDCOMPLETE       send the command and wait for the response     err  hcisendreq dd, amprq, 1      if err  goto cleanup      if cmdresponse.status           err  1         errno  bterrorcmdresponse.status       cleanup     freecr     if dd gt 0 closedd     return err  codepre  pcodep  pWhat is my mistake Does anyone know another option that will solve my problem.

Negative 3054 pThe weirdest thing is happening. I have an action sheet which gives the user the choice to either take a photo with the camera or choose one from the camera roll. Upon the UIImagePicker returning from selection I use the ALAssetsLibrary to determine the GPS information embedded in the photo.

Negative 3054 pI did a recent migration from CVS to SVN using cvs2svn tool. In the newly migrated project for one of my projects the latest version is part of a branch say branch AParent Directory. Within this project, I have a subproject, whose latest version is another branch say Branch B.So basically trunk doesnt have the latest version of my Main project.p  pSo in CVS once I checkout my parent folderBranch A, I would browse upto my subproject  RightClick  CVS  Update Special  choose Branch B As Branch B has the latest for subproject. This would checkout the latest version for the subproject and I would have the latest version of my Main Project.p  pIn SVN however, I do not see this option. SVN as far as I know, can only update with a revision and not a branch. I am new to SVN, so there is more probability that Im wrong. Is there a way to do what I was trying to do in the CVS scenariop  pI figured out a round about way to checkout the main projectBranch A and then checkout the subproject separatelyBranch B. Then I would delete this subproject from the first checkoutParent projectBranch A and replace it with the second checkout version of subproject.p
Negative 3054 pIf I understand a hrefhttpmvccontrib.codeplex.comwikipagetitleTestHelper relnofollowthe examplea correctly, MvcContrib TestHelper has a stronglytyped test of a route mapping to a particular controller.

Negative 3054 pI am building an order process, in which an codeOrdercode object is built through many steps. After each step I put the partly finished codeOrdercode object into the codesessioncode, and in the final step I save it into the database. p  pDuring the steps I load other, already existing associated objects into my codeOrdercode objecteg. codeDiscountCouponcode. The problem is that when I save my codeOrdercode to the codesessioncode and then load it in the next step, all associated entities will be detached. So when I want to save it to the database, the codeEntityManagercode throws an exception, which asks for setting a codecascadepersistcode on the relationship. p  pOf course, I dont need to persist those objectsthey are already in the database.

Negative 3054 pI came across this problem as I was working on the a hrefhttpwww.pythonchallenge.com relnofollowPython Challengea. Number 10 to be exact.

Negative 3054 pI understand a running asio service is like a queue I can use to post tasks a thread will execute sequentially. However, as any queue, I guess there are limits. Is it possible to set this limit for asio services Is it possible to set what policy to follow when the queue is full i.e. blocking, non blocking, etc.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSuppose I have a thread running an asioservice and a timer posting each 10ms a task to this thread. The task reception is bound to a method invokation which will make the thread sleeping for 100ms. I have therefore a timer posting 100 tasks a second to a thread which is capable of performing 10 tasks each second. It is evident that this situation will diverge. However, when dealing with queues, there are usually means to dimension the queue deepness 100 1000 posts enqueued, etc. or to specify the policy a sender should follow when the queue is full i.e. shall it wait or shall it drop the request and continue. My question is Ho to set these features in asioservicep

Negative 3054 pIve been trying to wrap my head around how move semantics in C11 are supposed to work, and Im having a good deal of trouble understanding what conditions a movedfrom object needs to satisfy. Looking at the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7027523whatcanidowithamovedfromobjectanswer herea doesnt really resolve my question, because cant see how to apply it to pimpl objects in a sensible way, despite arguments that a hrefhttpherbsutter.comgotw100 relnofollowmove semantics are perfect for pimplsa.p  pThe easiest illustration of my problem involves the pimpl idiom, like sop  precodeclass Foo      stduniqueptrltFooImplgt impl public      Inlining FooImpls constructors for brevitys sake otherwise it       defeats the point.     Foo  implnew FooImpl       Fooconst Foo amp rhs  implnew FooImplrhs.impl       FooFoo ampamp rhs  implstdmoverhs.impl       Foo amp operatorFoo rhs               stdswapimpl, rhs.impl          return this           void dostuff                implgtdostuff       codepre  pNow, what can I do once Ive moved from a codeFoocode I can destroy the movedfrom object safely, and I can assign to it, both of which are absolutely crucial. However, if I try to codedostuffcode with my codeFoocode, it will explode. Before I added move semantics for my definition of codeFoocode, every codeFoocode satisfied the invariant that it could codedostuffcode, and thats no longer the case. There dont seem to be many great alternatives, either, since for example putting the movedfrom codeFoocode would involve a new dynamic allocation, which partially defeats the purpose of move semantics.

However, I cant seem to find any similar service running on Android.  p  pThis must work without modifying the Android device, installing some service, or opening some port.

As he mentions, you can use a DNS lookup using your local DNS server to discover Android devices.

Negative 3054 pIm asking this question without database specifics because it feels like the answer may lie in a common design pattern, and I dont necessarily need a system specific solution  my specific system setup is referenced at the end of the question .p  pIve got a database of companies containing an id, a url, and a processing field, to indicate whether or not that company is currently being processed by one of my crawlers.  I run many crawlers in parallel. Each one needs to select a company to process and set that company as processing before it starts so that each company is only being processed by a single crawler at any given time.p  pstrongHow should I structure my system to keep track of what companies are being processedstrongp  pThe challenge here is that I cannot search my database for a company that is not being processed and then update that company to set it as processed, because another crawler may have chosen it in the meantime. This seems like something that must be a common problem when processing data in parallel so Im looking for a theoretical best practice.p  pI used to use MySQL for this and used the following code to maintain consistency between my processors.

Negative 3054 pIm putting together a simulation environment catered towards multiagentswarm robotic simulation.  The parts Ill be doing from scratch are the math library, physics engine, and AI engine.  These will be implemented in FCUDA.  Im looking for advice on how to best implement everything else  i.e. all of the other parts of a game engine.  After a bit of research in the beginning, it seemed like OGRE would be my best bet but Im still unsure.  Basically, I want to concentrate on the physicsai stuff and have some game engine do everything else for me  rendering, scene graphs, etc.p  pSomething Im confused about is how my FCUDA backend will interact with the rendering enginegame engine.  It seems like the popular engines are set up so you could replace parts of the architecture with your own implementations fairly easily...  Which one would be best for me to usep  pSince Im using CUDA and will be rendering results from the gpu, how will this affect implementation of a rendering engine like OGRE I know I cant be stuck just having to use straight OpenGL...p  pCurrently, Im looking at Ogre, Panda3D, jMonkey, and Gazebo.  On the surface, Gazebo seems like it could be exactly what Im looking for.p  pI am also considering Python and Lua, though Im leaning towards the latter.p  pId like for this simulation environment to be able to easily converted to or just used as a real game engine.  I know all of the elements would pretty much be there already, Im just stating that in case it helps with giving me advice.p  pAlso, I would emreallyem like for this thing to be able to run on the CUDAcapable Tegra 4s that are supposed to come out this quarter last I checked.  This may or may not be something that can accurately be determined at this point, but you guys will know better than me... i.e. if I want the possibility of future tegraandroid use, I should do everything in jMonkey  Would it matterp  p...Overall Im most interested in advice on what architecture configuration would work well with a FCUDA physics amp ai engine p
Negative 3054 pI am not asking a general guid vs ints which is better question. I know that, or atleast think I know that they both have specific scenarios where one is better than the other. But I do have a specific scenario where I am writing a chat application. I started the application with all my primary keys being ints. But after doing a bit of research I realized that I might be having a security flaw in the application as I am passing the primary key to a users browser for different entity requests such as chatrooms, talkers and such. One would agree that a subsequent primary key could be guessed and hence it is possible for users to alter other users sessions and states. In trying to prevent this, I was considering using guids as my primary key but then another thought hit me. A thought about performance. Since this is a chat application, is using a guid really going to cost me performancewise if the application comes under heavy load, say 10s or 100s of thousands of users simultaneously for e.g. I am not really informed enough to make a choice here. My question in short is, do I need to change my primary keys to guids to help make guessing primary keys harder or is there some other way that I could secure my application without resorting to guids. If the question is not clear enough, let me know and I will clarify, thanks.p

Negative 3054 pIm fairly new to WPF amp MVVM.  Ive created a couple standard simple WPFMVVM applications that show a startup screen and do processing, including displaying other user controls, based on commands within that main window.  p  pBut now I want to make a WPFMVVM monitoringinputgathering application that starts up without displaying a window, loops through checking the system state until conditions necessitate the windows display, and only THEN displays a window, then processes the user input and goes back to looping.  The user wouldnt be waiting for this window, because its only shown when theres something that needs the users attention.  It would run in the background forever, only showing itself when needed.p  pI see that I can make my own Main method, but I still cant figure out the best way to keep it in MVVM, yet only display the window as needed within a larger loop.p  pThanksp  pEDIT  we finally did the sane thing and made two different processes, one to do the monitoring and one to do the WPFing.

It all works wonderful, there is just one problem.  Sometimes when you click it and the dialogJQuery UI window opens, there in the text area there is nothing.  If you are to click it again it will pop back up.

Negative 3054 pIm cleaning up an API library, and trying to figure out the best way to handle unhandled exceptions.p  pRight now, the library catches just about everything that could go wrong with the API  credential errors, server errors, urllib2 errors, httplib errors, etc.  There will be edge cases.p  pMy current thinking is that 99 of library users dont care about the exception itself, they just care that the API call failed.  Only developers would care about the exception.p  pThat leads me to this solution p  precodeclass ApiErrorException     pass  class ApiUnhandledErrorApiError     pass codepre  pKnown issues with the API raise an ApiError or specific subclass.p  pEverything else raises an ApiUnhandledError , with the original error stashed in, which a user can either catch or ignore.p  precodetry     stuff except urllib2.UrlError , e      raise ApiErrorraisede except Exception as e      raise ApiUnhandledErrorraisede codepre  pDoes this sound like a good approach to ensuring the users just know a PassFail , while developers can maintain a method of support p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pBased on the consensus of best practices, I wont be trapping this.p  pThe original goal was to allow people to do thisp  precodetry    stuffa    otherstuff    evenmorestuff     api.proxyurl     againstuff    againothers  except api.ApiUnhandledError , e      handle error  except api.ApiError , e      handle error  except Stuff , e       other error  except      raise codepre  pin that example, the user only has to catch ApiError  and optionally ApiUnhandledError or any of the other subclasses p  pi thought this would be largely preferable to every api interaction having its own block p  precodetry    stuffa    otherstuff    evenmorestuff     try        api.proxyurl      except api.ApiError , e          handle error      except CatchSomething1 , e          handle error      except CatchSomething2 , e          handle error      except CatchSomething3 , e          handle error      except CatchSomething4 , e          handle error      except         raise     againstuff    againothers  except Stuff , e       other error  except      raise codepre  pwhen dealing with urllib2 , ive seem to discover a new exception every day.  these exceptions tend to get very long and difficult to maintain.p

Negative 3054 pI am developing a web application with ratchet.js and their push.js and have a very basic problem. My CSS code positions elements in one page in three columns. The user then can click on a navigation bar button to goto the next page. Once in the next page, the user can search for something. For the search, I handle it via a form and use jquery to detect when a form is submitted. However, when the form is submitted, the page is reloaded and push.js malfunctions. When this happens and the user clicks to go back to the first page, my css does not function properly as it is still surrounded by the second pages content div. My question is there a way to submit a form without reloading a page jquerys event.preventDefault does not work If not, can push.js be used and then have the page reload itself once the transition is completedp  pBasic Code Examples  Page 1 p  precode    ltbodygt         ltdiv classcontentgt             ltdiv classsliderBackground idsliderContainer stylebackground black height 40px width 100gt                 ltdiv idleftgtrandom leftltdivgt                 ltdiv idcentergtrandom centerltdivgt                 ltdiv idrightgtrandom Rightltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt codepre  pPage 2p  precode    ltbodygt         ltdiv classcontentgt             ltform idsearchgt                 ltinput typesearch idsearcher placeholderSearch stylewidth 95gt             ltformgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt      necessary imports jquery etc      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          search.submitfunctionevent                event.preventDefault  does not do anything push.js... reloads page                ltscriptgt codepre  pto reiterate my problem, the user clicks on a link not shown in basic code to use push.js to goto page 2. in page 2, they sure, where the page reloads when it should not I am using ajax to utilize the search query etc. When the user goes back, the left, center, right css no longe works.p

Negative 3054 pWhen I launch my application in debug mode to try to find why Im not getting any data returned, I set a breakpoint that is never reached. I call this code when a ReportViewer is loaded. For testing I give it the ID of 9 to return a generic list of data...p  precodeperformanceReportDataList  PerformanceReportData.GetPerformanceReportDataByMilestoneID9 rptViewer.LocalReport.DataSources.AddNew Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms.ReportDataSourcedsPerformanceReportData, performanceReportDataList codepre  pThe second line of code is never hit. The application skips the rest of the code in the method and just loads up the ReportViewer completely blank. Now there is some behind the scenes code through a few layers that takes place as the first line is called to fill the generic list. I pass the ID, create a command object and give it the ID as a parameter and call a stored procedure. Running the same thing on the database returns the data just fine, but heres where my code stops....p  precode Public Shared Function GetDataTableUsingReaderByVal sql As String, Optional ByVal parameterList As ListOf DataParameter  Nothing, Optional ByVal type As CmdType  CmdType.StoredProcedure As DataTable         Dim cmd As OleDbCommand  CreateCommandsql, parameterList, type         Dim dt As New DataTable         Using cmd.Connection             cmd.Connection.Open             dt.Loadcmd.ExecuteReaderCommandBehavior.CloseConnection  Last Line Hit         End Using         Return dt End Function codepre  pAbove is a method in my DAL. It goes to dt.Load and then doesnt hit any other line of code, it skips right back to the application and loads the ReportViewer form with no data. Theres no exception, no nothing. Ive seen stuff like this happen before with a classmate back when I was in college, really dont remember what his issue was though. Anyone else have any ideasp

Negative 3054 pWell I know they do, according to my experience and the Oracle Java API documentation, but I wonder why. Through the constructor Im only allowed to pass codeintcode type arguments to the codeRectanglecode class, the internal data representation of x, y, etc. are of the type codeintcode and also codesetSizecode only excepts arguments of the type codeintcode. But why do all methods like codegetXcode, codegetYcode, codegetWidthcode, etc. return a double when there can not be any precision Why not simple codeintcodes as expectedp  pEDIT I do understand that it is derived from the codeRectangle2Dcode class, but that is still no reason to just simply not provide any codeintcodebased codegetXcode and codegetYcode functions, as in difference with the codePointcode and codePoint2Dcode class those methods are not abstract. Also codesetLocationcode is not abstract either.p

Negative 3054 pI am trying to pull some data from SQL Server to Microsoft Excel 2007.  I have the connection setup and everything seems to be working fine except for the Timestamps.  I can only get the dates to come through, not the corresponding hours, minutes or seconds.

Negative 3054 pWith a fresh download of Cordova 2.9 and the Cordova CLI, I created Hello World application via the CLI. I also added the iOS platform via the CLI.

Negative 3054 pI have a relatively simple database design that I will simplify here for the sake of brevity. p  pI have 4 tables  codeProducts, ProductSizes, Stores, Catalogscode. p  pThere are 6 stores and each store has its own unique customized catalog, an assortment of different products and sizes that is chosen from the codeProductscode and codeProductSizescode tables. p  pI am wondering how to best design the codeCatalogscode table.

This would result in a single id per product for each codeCatalogscode entry.p  pI would love to hear some critique and better suggestions as I feel this just isnt right and cant put my finger on how to better design this. Also, if we were to ever implement more than 1 catalog per store, I know this current design would cause me grief. Any feedback would greatly appreciatedp

In result of serialization I got json in which I have a contactInfo as a map which is basically what we have as a returned type in getter. But when I deserialize it then Jackson is trying to instantiate contactInfo as a set which is also true cause contactInfo is a set. But of course Jackson cant map the json value to set and strange exception occurs.

Negative 3054 pFirst of all Id like to apologise for my bad English  Yesterday I finished writing my first multiplayer game Pong in C using Winsock and Allegro5. The game consists of one server for all players and clients.p  pEvery frame FPS  60 clients send their mousey coordinates to the server which passes them to their opponents clients respectively. When I play the game on my 2 computers connecting to the server, which runs on one of them, by local network it works perfectly, opponents paddle is moving smoothly. But when I do the same connecting through my external IP address the opponents paddle is lagging, which ruins the game, because its client which checks if the ball hit opponents paddle or not. Thus synchronisation is ruined, whenever I move one paddle to bounce the ball on the other computer it lags and doesnt make it in time resulting in scoring a point for opponent... But its not the game which is lagging. My paddle and the ball are moving smoothly. The problem is only with opponents paddle.p  pIm new to network programming as Ive only read a hrefhttpbeej.usguidebgnet relnofollowBeejs Guide to Network Programminga. I use TCP sockets to send and recv coordinates of paddles and select function to poll sockets for data.p  pI dont have a single idea what could be the cause.p  pTLDR Opponents paddle lags when I connect through external IP, but it doesnt when I connect through local IP.p

Negative 3054 pI have a class within a namespace in a header file. The class requires a template type, and I only want certain types to be used.

Negative 3054 pIm currently making block based wrappers around some methods of the Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box.com SDKs. Ive successfully wrapped upload functionality into all three, and they all work nicely. The wrappers have a common interface that conform to a universal spec among the three services, which is why Im doing this.p  pDropbox is the only one that runs on delegate callbacks. I have no issues with the upload classes. However, Im trying to implement some download classes in the same manner. Im running into an issue so far that my returned instances are getting immediately deallocated before any of the delegate methods in the wrapper are called.  First, check out the method structure of the emworkingem Upload classp  precodeiduploaderWithPathsNSMutableDictionary paths                progressJAUploadProgressBlockprogBlock               completedJAUploadCompletedBlockcompBlock                 failedJAUploadFailedBlockfailBlock  voidupload  in .m return [[[self class] alloc]initWithPathspaths                                   progressprogBlock                                  completedcompBlock                                     failedfailBlock] voidupload      setup Dropbox Rest Client     configure delegate, etc     [dbRestClient doUpload...]  delegate stuff ..onProgress  self.progressBlockprogress  ..onComplete  self.completedBlockinfo  ..onFailed  self.failedBlockerror codepre  pThus, instantiating and performing an upload goes like thisp  precodeJAUploadProgressBlock progress  CGFloat percentage      NSLog.2f,percentage  JAUploadCompletedBlock completed  NSMutableDictionary info      NSLogSuccess ,info  JAUploadFailedBlock failed  NSError error      NSLogFailed ,[error localizedDescription] JAUploadWrapperDropbox uploader        [JAUploadWrapperDropbox uploaderWithPathspaths                                         progressprogress                                        completedcompleted                                           failedfailed] [uploader upload] codepre  pIn the upload wrapper class, the instance does not get deallocated immediately, the delegate messages inside the wrapper get called, my block callbacks fire, and everything goes as planned. p  pstrongHowever, my Download wrapper class, which is modeled exactly like the upload wrapper, gets deallocated before any of the delegate methods in the wrapper are called.strongp  pThis class is not conducive to being a property, because its not suited for reuse. Its really meant to be used once or as one offs.

Negative 3054 pI can embed graphics in an HTML report with an img having a src attribute  codedataimagepngbase64,base64encodedcharactersgoherecode.p  pIt works fine in all the browsers Ive tested.p  pThe last hurdle, so far, is to embed the encoded favicon.ico file inside the HTML report so that the browser doesnt have to perform a GET.p  pSo far, the best solution I have is one which requires the favicon to appear publicly on our web site. But that doesnt completely handle the selfcontained goal we stated. This solution requires me to specify a shortcut icon link and if that truly is the only way to do, then so be it. But Id like to know for sure. I just dont want to have a directory full of versioncontrolled favicond.ico files.p  pBackground...p  pI have an XML  XSLT  HTML desktop application that produces HTML reports that can be selfcontained and shared, say, via email attachments. The selfcontained nature is useful for resolving a lot of version control problems that I dont want to solve. I have, in fact, solved most of them.p  pThe goal, of course, in making selfcontained reports is that the recipients browser need perform no GETs. So, stylesheets and most graphics are embeddedencoded in the HTML page without significantly increasing the HTML reports size.p  pI say all this to head off a lot of obvious questions about why I even want to do this. But keep in mind, this is not a web site, it is simply a report generator.p

I have a Notes view, responsible for owning the collections HTML content seen above, and a Note view, responsible for rendering each Note model.br The problem is that each Note models required output is made of two sections of HTML, in different parts title and content of the DOM owned by Notes View.p  pMy question is, how do you work it such that the render method on the Note View is able to return the necessary HTML to poke into both the titles and contentp  pIt doesnt feel like it can return both items in one return value, and maybe Ill need to return an array with two elements title html and content html.  Is this the canonical best way of approaching this issue in Backbonep  pSuggestions for further reading gratefully received.p
Negative 3054 pIve managed to modify CCTray using a transport extension to connect to a local Jenkins server running on my locahost. I cannot however connect to the openshift remote jenkins server which has been setup on my account.p  pI can access it correctly from the Openshift Jenkins Web URL however I cant connect to it using the CCTray transport extension, it just times out. I think its because it tries to connect to the actual port the Jenkins server is running on and this is being blocked.p  pWould installing and running the client toolsssh comms fix this problemp  pOr is this impossible to do. It is a very nice notifications tray program so would be great to get it working.p  pAny ideas would be very much appreciatedp

Negative 3054 pI have an app with a UIViewController containing a UITableView using a custom table view cell. I have used the same custom table view cell with UITableViewControllers successfully but this time its a UITableView in a UIViewController. My first thoughts were that it really should be no different. However, for some reason, in my cellForRowAtIndexPath, upon initial loading, cell is not nil, as it should be, so the code to instantiate the custom cell is never called.  p  pIve created the custom cell both by using interface builder and by hand coding it with identical results. The only noticible difference is that the code works correctly when using it with a UITableViewController but fails when using it with a UIView containing a UITableView. p  pI have verified that my cell identifier is properly configured and my datasource and delegates are properly set in my UIViewController. The custom cell has its subclass properly set.p  precodeFaveCelltableViewUITableViewtableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  FaveCell cell  FaveCell[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiercellID] ifcell  nil      this line of code is never reached     cell  [[FaveCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifiercellID]    code to load controls  ...    return cell  codepre  pSo, when the code enters cellForRowAtIndexPath for the first time, cell should be nil, but its not. Again, the only noticable difference being UIViewUITableView vs UITableViewController. Does this make sense to anyone Can anyone offer a solution Thanksp

Therefore, the only solution that Ive found to work at all isp  ol liExit Eclipseli liWait for the process to endli liExecute codeant clean releasecodeli ol  pThis is excruciating because as we know, restarting Eclipse is a royal pain. Furthermore, all affected projects need to be cleaned which makes the entire process take up to half an hour. Ive opened a hrefhttpcode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid60496issue 60496 on b.android.coma, but havent heard any official response.p  pIs there any solution to this aside from biting the bullet and switching to Android Studiop

Negative 3054 pI have a serial queue created as followsp  precodeself.myQueue  dispatchqueuecreatecom.myDomain.myQueue, DISPATCHQUEUESERIAL codepre  pI have an sqlite3 database to store up my data. Instead of committing this data every time, each time I get a piece of data, I store it up in a buffer  in this case, a lower level CPPbased vector.p  pI add blocks onto my private queue to write to the buffer. I use dispatchasync to do this. After a predefined time interval I commit data to the DB from the buffer.p  pWhen the DBs are below 5MB, things work as expected  each data comes in, each is written to the buffer, after the time interval expires, the data is committed to the DB from the buffer.p  pWhen the DB size increases to above 5 MB approx., the blocks on the queue seem not to execute until the time interval for committing data to the DB. When this time is done, one record is written to the buffer. The next time, the time interval expires, data is committed to the DB and again only one record is written to the buffer  this time a different record which is in the sequence i expect the records to come in. It seems like each block is executed only after I have written to the DB which happens only each time I am at the defined time interval.p  pNote I have checked that these blocks that do execute, execute cleanly  without errors.p  pI cant understand the link here between the size of the DB and the nonexecution if there is such a word of the blocks on the private queue.p  pDoes thread width of he private queue have anything to do with it Or memory concerns I would say the size of the DB, but it seems like the everytimeintervalblocks execute correctly. Also, I would say DB size directly, but Im not able to write to the buffer itself.p  pAny thoughts to give me direction OR is this an OS issue out of my controlp

Negative 3054 pConsider that i have two threads  THREAD 1 and THREAD 2.  I just wanted to communicate between them.  THREAD 1 contains a value which is stored in pointer and THREAD 2 needs that pointer value to be accessed around that thread. p  pAs per my understanding, I think we can directly dereference a pointer from one thread to another. But my friends suggestion is that I only access the value through IPC mechanism, not my suggestion.p  pPlease comment on this. What is the best way to do and why... p
Negative 3054 pI need to understand the process of how we can count the number of a specific visualforce page opened by a user. The reason for this question is to see if i can find out what are the pages mostly used by users and enhance it so that i can make users life easier .p  pWhat i know is we need to use some kind of function when page is loading. If there is any otherway i would love to understand it. If you have questions please feel free to ask, i know sometimes we cant put something in writing what we have inour mind. p
Negative 3054 pIm using Libgdx and Im still kind of a noob with it not programming, just Libgdx. I have one of those large png tile sheets, and I also have the individual tiles.

Negative 3054 pI have written a small program to convert webm vorbis audio to aac format, using FFmpeg libraries  C on Windows using 32 bit Zeranoe FFmpeg builds. After writing this program, I find it is sometimes converting files as per expectation, and at other times, results in larger duration files, and audio playback is brokenawkward as well. p  pThis code appears to be working fine for mp3, which also uses FLTP format same as vorbis, so technically both look similar.p  pPlease see below sample code I am usingp  precode include stdafx.h  include

We put this into a special       section so we can force the header to be in the start of the final program.       You dont need to understand all these details as it is just magic values that       is documented in the multiboot standard. The bootloader will search for this       magic sequence and recognize us as a multiboot kernel.      section .multiboot      align 4         dd MAGIC         dd FLAGS         dd CHECKSUM           Currently the stack pointer register esp points at anything and using it may          cause massive harm. Instead, well provide our own stack. We will allocate          room for a small temporary stack by creating a symbol at the bottom of it,          then allocating 16384 bytes for it, and finally creating a symbol at the top.         section .bootstrapstack         align 4         stackbottom         times 16384 db 0         stacktop           The linker script specifies start as the entry point to the kernel and the          bootloader will jump to this position once the kernel has been loaded. It          doesnt make sense to return from this function as the bootloader is gone.         section .text         global start         start      Welcome to kernel mode We now have sufficient code for the bootloader to      load and run our operating system. It doesnt do anything interesting yet.      Perhaps we would like to call printfHello, Worldn. You should now      realize one of the profound truths about kernel mode There is nothing      there unless you provide it yourself. There is no printf function. There      is no ltstdio.hgt header. If you want a function, you will have to code it      yourself. And that is one of the best things about kernel development      you get to make the entire system yourself. You have absolute and complete      power over the machine, there are no security restrictions, no safe      guards, no debugging mechanisms, there is nothing but what you build.       By now, you are perhaps tired of assembly language. You realize some      things simply cannot be done in C, such as making the multiboot header in      the right section and setting up the stack. However, you would like to      write the operating system in a higher level language, such as C or C.      To that end, the next task is preparing the processor for execution of      such code. C doesnt expect much at this point and we only need to set up      a stack. Note that the processor is not fully initialized yet and stuff      such as floating point instructions are not available yet.       To set up a stack, we simply set the esp register to point to the top of      our stack as it grows downwards.     mov esp, stacktop       We are now ready to actually execute C code. We cannot embed that in an      assembly file, so well create a kernel.c file in a moment. In that file,      well create a C entry point called kernelmain and call it here.     extern kernelmain     call kernelmain       In case the function returns, well want to put the computer into an      infinite loop. To do that, we use the clear interrupt cli instruction      to disable interrupts, the halt instruction hlt to stop the CPU until      the next interrupt arrives, and jumping to the halt instruction if it ever      continues execution, just to be safe.     cli         .hang     hlt     jmp .hang codepre  pMy linker script linker.ldp  precode The bootloader will look at this image and start execution at the symbol codepre  pdesignated as the entry point.

Negative 3054 pWell here is an interesting experience i had since last couple of weeks structuring my maven multi module project.p  pWhen i decided to use maven for my build life cycle management i had couple of reason that i wished to choose maven.p  pa. Mostly development teams are divided so that each team can work on separate Module within the project like TeamA to work on User Management System, TeamB to work on Authorization System, TeamC to work on Document Management System...and so on. Each team has java developers, testers, UI experts etc. p  pSo the maven Project structure should be such that each team can independently work on their respective modules. They must be able to code, compile, build, test, deploy their module without having to compile, test modules belonging to other teams. p  pAnd thus i came to conclusion that each development module of the maven multimodule project must represent a Functional Modulep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhjRQQ.png altPROJECT STRUCTURE 1p  pAfter some discussions on forums i found people suggesting me to follow layered approach were child modules must be layers like controllerlayer,servicelayer,daolayer etc. I did not pay heed to this advice because this not solving my purpose of teams working on individual module. This way for large project the build and deployment time for each team during development increases which does impact the project timelines. sometimes the build and deploy time is upto 30 minutes say if there are 10 to 11 modules in the project.p  pBut i did pay heed to a suggestion that keeping DAO layer separate for each module is not a good idea as DAO is highly granular and reused by other modules. and so the dependency of one module on other would would any how become greater.p  pI found a solution to this problem by creating a common module and moving DAOs and DOMAIN to the common module which will be inherited as a dependency by each module. And this seems to be a more viable option. Now the Project Structure looks like this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3Sdof.png altPROJECT STRUCTURE 2p  pNow when i build the project and run the webapp on server, It complains 404, Resource Not Found. I found that this is because the WEBINFclasses folder is missing, srcmainjava is missing in webapp module. I searched and found couple of links that suggested it is Deployment Assembly issue in Eclipse. So i need to manually create these folders and add in the deployment assembly because maven does not do it.p  pBut the bigger questions arep  ol lido i need to move the Controller classes like com.mycompany.usermgmtsys.controller.UserMgmtController etc.. to srcmainjava Or maven should find the controllers from the module jars included as dependency in WEBINFlib.li ol  pI dont want to do this i.e. putting java file in webapp. i want all the controllers should be available to the webapp as dependency for example WEBINFlibusermgmtsystem.jar.

Here it is so far...p  precode   Use this file to deploy an app to the staging server on nodejitsu   var bash  requirechildprocess.spawnbash var colors  requirecolors var fs  requirefs   stdout setup bash.stdout.ondata, function data    console.logstdout   data  bash.stdout.onerror, function err    console.logstdout error .red, err    on bash exit bash.onexit, function code    console.logExiting... , code    grab package.json var package   fs.readFilepackage.json, encoding utf8, function err, data   grab the package.json file contents   if err throw err   package  JSON.parsedata   fs.renamepackage.json, renamemebeforedeploying.json  rename the package.json file   package.name  stajing  alter json   package.subdomain  stajing  alter json   package.domains  []  alter json   fs.writeFilepackage.json, JSON.stringifypackage, null, 2, functionerr   write the new package to package.json     if err throw err     bash.stdin.writejitsu deployn  Deploy to staging app on nodejitsu.     setTimeoutfunction    this needs to be replaced       bash.stdin.writeyesn     , 5000     console.logAll done        bash.stdin.end  close out     codepre  pI have a few issues here. Im pretty sure all I need to know to complete it, is the event that fires when nodejitsu prompts me to increment the version number codeprompt Is this ok  yescode so that I can confirm, if that happens, and the event that fires when the whole process finishes so that I can revert the changes to my package.json file, leaving my app deployed to a staging environment and my files essentially untouched. p

Negative 3054 pI have a need to generate several code.rdlccode reports as PDF files in a Winforms app.  There is no need to display the reports.  The app is using the codeLocalReportcode object to render the reports to PDFs.p  pThis takes a while to do, and I was wondering whether it would be possible to generate each of my reports in a separate thread.  The app has a codeGenerateReportcode method that takes a report name as a parameter and creates a new, local codeLocalReportcode object, so it lends itself to wrapping in a codeSystem.Threading.Taskcode.p  pHowever, this seems not to be threadsafe  it looks as if something deep in the rendering code uses a temp file and all instances of codeLocalReportcode use that same temp file name.  I get IO errors because one instance has deleted the temp file and another is still trying to use it.p  pIs there a threadsafe way to render multiple PDFs from separate .rdlc files, simultaneously  p  pEDITED TO ADD  Error message and Stack tracep  pThe process cannot access the file CUsersXXXXXXXXAppDataLocalTemp2ngs2k1g.out because it is being used by another process.p

Negative 3054 pIm currently working on calling C code from R  simple stuff like calculating some value from a passed integer works fine, but for my next piece of code I need to go a bit deeper. In my C code, I use a custom C struct which holds pointers to various stuff the function works with, but what type does a C struct correspond to in R, since I figure I need to initialize it somehow Or would I rather add another abstraction layer that takes no arguments, is called by R, then initializes the struct normally and calls the function needing the struct internallyp

Negative 3054 pSo I have been writing a program that uses a tessellation shader and a height map to draw an environment. It starts out as a 32x32 plane, and when it gets more tessellated the heights of each square vertex are determined by the height map.p  pI want it so that the closer the patch is to the camera, the more tessellated it gets. However, I have discovered that this causes gaps between patches. If a patch is more tessellated than one next to it, the different resolutions cause gaps.p  pHere, a picture is worth a thousand words img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjvOdc.png altTessellated Environment img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com07Kpn.jpg altTessellated Environmentp  pIf two patches have the same resolution then there are no gaps. How can I get around this problem Im completely stuck.p

Negative 3054 pIve got a div with a draggable element which works great in all browsers, except in IE10, there is an issue where if you attempt to drag the element by the scrollbar, it will scroll, until you mouseup, in which case the element will snap to the current position of your mouse.p  pIve setup this fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netHhja41 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netHhja41ap  pIf you are using IE10, just click and hold on the scroll bar and then let go.

Negative 3054 pIm trying to work out the best way to unit test success and error callbacks in controllers. I am able to mock out service methods, as long as the controller only uses the default q functions such as then see the example below.

So, in actual fact, by trying to handle success  error I am letting http concerns leak into my controller, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid by wrapping the http calls in a service.

Negative 3054 pI am having an issue with Datatables and deletion in my MVC application. I have a button for each row that when clicked opens up a modal window that asks the user if they want to delete that row. If they click OK, the data is removed from my database, the row deleted is deleted, and the window closes. This all works as expected when I delete one row. However, problems arise when I attempt to delete any other row after my first delete without refreshing the page.p  pWhen I click on the delete for a second time, my function first attempts to delete the initial row strongagainstrong and fails because it does not exist anymore. Then it immediately and successfully deletes the new row I asked to delete. I have have console outputs that tell me what ID the delete function has and they revealed that the old ID is being repassed to the function first.p  pHere is my ouput if I delete one row with ID  87 and then delete another with ID  84 without refreshing the console or pagep  precodeclicked delete on 87 Deleting 87 DELETE httplocalhost49773apiIncidentAPI87 200 OK Deleted  clicked delete on 87 Deleting 87 DELETE httplocalhost49773apiIncidentAPI87 500 Internal Server Error  clicked delete on 84 Deleting 84 DELETE httplocalhost49773apiIncidentAPI84 200 OK NetworkError 500 Internal Server Error  httplocalhost49773apiIncidentAPI87 Deleted codepre  pHere is the code for my delete button in each rowp  precode.Delete.unbind.onclick, function                   var tr  this.closesttr                 var ID  dataLog.rowtr.data[16]                 tr.addClassdeleteHighlight                  deleteWindow.dialogopen                  .deleteOK.onclick, function                       console.logclicked delete on   ID                      deleteIncidentID  deletes the row with that ID                     .Details.bind                                   .deleteClose.onclick, function event, ui                      console.logClose delete                     tr.removeClassdeleteHighlight, 500                     deleteWindow.dialogclose                                codepre  pHere is my delete methodp  precodefunction deleteIncidentID          var rowID    ID         console.logDeleting   rowID          .ajax             url apiIncidentAPI  ID,             type DELETE,             contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,             success function results                  console.logDeleted                  dataLog.rowrowID.remove.draw                 deleteWindow.dialogclose                            codepre
Negative 3054 pI am creating a website using Spring MVC and for persistence I am using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate 4 as my JPA provider. Validation is being handled at present with Hibernate Validator. I have a problem whereby my validators are being called twice and I cant figure out why. The main reason this is a problem is because the second time round, dependencies are not being autowired into the validator and I am getting a null pointer exception. The following is the sequence of calls leading up to the failurep  ol liThe registration form is submitted and first the NotDefaultSectValidator is called  and completes successfully for the whereDidYouHearAboutUs field on the user object.li liThe UniqueUsernameValidator is called next and completes successfully for the username field validation.li liThe addUserFromForm method on the controller starts and finds no errors in the bindingResults object.li liThe addUser method is then called on the UserService class. This method reaches the line userRepository.saveuser but never then runs the print.ln line immediate afterwards. Stepping over this line takes be back to the NotDefaultSectValidator breakpoint. This completes for the second time and I reenter the second validator UniqueUsernameValidator . Here I get a null pointer exception because for some reason Spring fails to Autowire in the DAO this second time.li ol  pCan anyone shed light on why the validators are being called twice and in particular, why stepping over line userRepository.saveuser goes back into these validatorsp  pMany thanksp  pHere is my user.java classp  precodepackage com.dating.domain  import java.util.HashSet

Negative 3054 pId like to know if its possible to set permissions on a page table entry for the ARM7 Cortex A8 specifically MMU such that code execution from the page is allowed, but reads are not allowed.p  pIf the permissions are orthogonal you might think that if XN execute never is not set, that execution would be allowed regardless of if reading is allowed.p  pOf course, some ARM code reads from itself as its executing to get literals that are stored just beyond the end of the function for example, that code would be unlikely to work.p  pIf the code you were trying to execute emdidntem do any reads from itself more specifically, from the page with reading disabled, would the code execute as expected or would you get a data abort or other exceptionp

Negative 3054 pIn my WPF strongMVVMstrong application I have a codeListBoxcode with codeCanvascode as its codeItemsPanelcode. The ListBoxs items are dynamically created by the user when he clicks a button  the codeListBox.ItemsSourcecode is a list of codeElementscode custom type stored in my codeMainViewModelcode, which is the codeDataContextcode of my codeMainWindowcode.p  pCurrently my codeElementcode class describes simple objects with X and Y coordinates so that it could be drawn on the Canvas of my ListBox and some data called codeShapeGeometrycode to be drawn as a path.

Instead, Id like my ListBoxItem to be a codeComplexElementcode containing a list of codeElementcode items, which means the drawn item would now consist of a various number of Paths. Now, my idea on how to achieve this would be to define codeListBoxItemcode as codeListBoxcode with codeViewBoxcode  codeCanvascode as its codeItemsPanelcode, just as it is on the upper level, but it seems overly complicated and could perhaps prove to be a little inefficient I intend to have tens if not a few hundreds of items. Is there a simpler way around it Can I somehow avoid having ListBoxes in every codeListBoxItemcodep
Negative 3054 pI am trying to compare namespaces to see if my method only throws the correct exceptions. With the correct exceptions I mean the followingp  ol liExceptions from the same namespace.li liExceptions from a higher namespace.li liExceptions from equivalent and higher Systemnamespace.li ol  pExamplesp  ol liMethod is in namespace codeMyNamespace.Collections.Genericcode so it can throw exceptions from codeMyNamespace.Collections.Genericcode.li liMethod is in namespace codeMyNamespace.Collections.Genericcode so it can throw exceptions from codeMyNamespace.Collectionscode and codeMyNamespacecode.li liMethod is in namespace codeMyNamespace.Collections.Genericcode so it can throw exceptions from codeSystem.Collections.Genericcode and codeSystem.Collectionscode and codeSystemcode.li ol  pThe first part is quite easy checking for the same namespace. Also one part of number 3 worked because codeSystemcode namespace is always correct. p  pFor the other parts I tried the following p  precodestring[] exceptNamespaceSegments  exceptionNamespaceSegments                                    .ExceptclassNamespaceSegments                                    .ToArray  if exceptNamespaceSegments.Length  1 ampamp exceptNamespaceSegments.FirstOrDefault  System     return codepre  pWhich checks if the namespacesegments Collections, Generic are also used in the classnamespace. If this is the case, the correct exception is thrown. p  pBut this wouldnt work for a case where the exception is in namespace codeSystem.Collections.Generic.Somethingcode, because codeSomethingcode isnt in the classnamespace. p  pCome to think of it, this doesnt take into account the sequence. So codeSystem.Generic.Collectionscode would also be correct using what I currently have.p  pIs there any way I can get this done without having to write a butload of ifstatements comparing each individual segmentp

Negative 3054 pI have several large stdvectors of chars bytes loaded from binary files. p  pWhen my program runs out of memory, I need to be able to cull some of the memory used by these vectors. These vectors are almost the entirety of my memory usage, and theyre just caches for local and network files, so its safe to just grab the largest one and chop it in half or so.p  pOnly thing is, Im currently using vectorresize and vectorshrinktofit, but this seems to require more memory I imagine for a reallocation of the new size and then a bunch of time for destruction of the now destroyed pointers, which I thought would be free and then copying the remaining to the new vector.

Negative 3054 pI developed an ajax file uploader and it works great if the one instance is on the page. Im trying to convert it to allow multiple instances, and it almost works, EXCEPT, when Im uploading multiple files in one form, it uploads the first file fine, but then for all subsequent files, for some reason it points forward to the next file reader from the second form instance. If I upload using the last second instance of the upload form, multiple files upload fine. But if I try uploading with the first instance, it will upload the first file, but all subsequent files get sent to the empty file input from the second instance. I cant understand why. Im using unique id names throughout the upload form and referencing that unique id throughout the javascript functions. Ill try to include all the necessary bits of code below.p  pThe forms are generated by PHP. The php var codeuidcode is a randomly generated unique id that I use throughout.

With multiple instances on the page, it reads the settings correctly for each different instance.

Negative 3054 pMy motivation for asking this question is that I have found an interesting problem using machine learning on a graph data set.  There are papers out there on this subject.  For example, emLearning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data on a Directed Graph Zhou, Huang, Scholkopfem.  However I do not have a background in artificial intelligence or machine learning so I would like to write a smaller program for a more general audience before working on anything scientific.p  pSeveral years ago I wrote a game called Solumns.  It is an evil variant of the classic Sega game Columns.  Inspired by a hrefhttpwww.di.unipi.itfpoloniprogbastet.html relnofollowbasteta, it bruteforces for colour combinations disadvantageous to the player.  It is hard.p  pI would like to improve upon its AI.  I figure the game space grid of coloured blocks, column positions, column colours fits a graph structure better than a list of attributes.  If that is the case, then this problem is similar to my research problem.p  pI am considering using the following highlevel plan to solve this problemp  ol liIm thinking what would be useful is if the AI opponent could assign a fitness rating to a possible move based on more data than the number of existing squares on the board after the move.  Im thinking using a categoriser.  Train on the move and all past moves, using the course of the rest of the game as a measure of success.li liI am also thinking of developing a player bot that can beat the standard AI opponent.  This could be useful when generating data for 1.li liUse a sample of the player bots games to build an AI that beats the strategic player.  Maybe use this data for 1, too.li liWrite a fun AI that delegates to a possible combination of 1, 3, and the original AI, when appropriate, which I will determine using experimentation to find heuristic fudge factors.li ol  pTo build the player bot, I figured I could use brute force to compute the sample space.  Then use machine learning techniques such as those used in building Random Forests to create some kind of decision maker.p  pBuilding the AI opponent is where I am most perplexed.p  pSpecific questions thenp  ul liRating moves sounds like the kind of thing people do with chess, and although Ill admit my approach may be ignorant, there is a lot about this in literature and I can learn from that.  Question is, should the player bot and AI opponent create the data sample  It sounds like Im getting confused between different sample sets, which sounds like a recipe for bad training.  Should I just play the game a bunchli liWhat kind of algorithm should I consider for training the player bot against the current AIli liWhat kind of algorithm should I consider for training an AI opponent against the player botli ul  pExtra infop  ul liI am deliberately not asking if this strategy is a good fit for programming a game AI.  Sure, you might be able to write a great AI more simply after all it is emalreadyem difficult to play.  I want to learn about machine learning by doing something fun.li liThe original game was written in a mixture of racket and C.  I am porting it to jruby for various reasons, likely with extensions or RPC calls to another faster language.  I am not so interested in existing languagespecific solutions here.

Negative 3054 pI have a small language which is basically an extension of OCaml actually it is an extension of a subset of OCaml, but that hardly matters. To simplify things I have one escape expression that transport OCaml literals into my language hence you are able to embed arbitrary OCaml code into this language. To compile such an expression to OCaml would simply mean to unwrap the string, but how does one evaluate itp  pOf course I understand that OCaml is a statically typed language and how that type system works in general. Hence I also need to be able to provide an environment and inspect the inferred type of the expression or at least cope with type errors. I am also aware of the need to manage the interpreter state etc. Lets assume for the moment that the embedded expressions are sideeffect free.p  pObviously this is possible, since both utop and the toplevel are implemented in OCaml themselves. So my first idea was to just pick one of them and adapt them to my needs. Now to my problemsp  ul liptoplevel is obviously part of the main distribution. Although there is a toplevel.mli with the necessary functions and even a .mllib, I cannot find toplevel as  empackaged libraryem  are there further configuration tweaks needed to get the interpreterasalibrary packagepli liputop seems to do even more strange things. From what I can tell from the sources, it copies some compilerlibs into its source directory at build time. This seems to be quite weird If it knows at build time how to find these compiler libraries, why not simply linkpli ul  pSo is there any reasonably established way to embed an OCaml interpreter into an OCaml programp

I can use the DirectX 9 samples though. The problem is likely not directly related to SharpDX since im also seing similar problems with SlimDX and the other DirectX samples.p  pThe only DirectX driver types that work when using Direct3D 10  11 are D3DDRIVERTYPEREFERENCE and D3DDRIVERTYPEWARP. D3DDRIVERTYPEHARDWARE does not seem to be working. This does not only affect SharpDX, C samples also let me only choose between RFERENCE and WARP drivers.p  pMy understanding is that those drivertypes are merely software rasterizers. Which implies that my directx installation is not working properly. But i dont see any errors, the latest drivers are installed and the system is reporting the DirectX 11 drivers and the Graphics adapter supports DirectX 11.p  ul lidxdiag is not reporting any errorsli lidxdiag confirms that DirectX 11 drivers are installedli liIm using a GT 460, which should support DirectX 11li liSystem is Windows 7 64bit  VS2013li ul  pSharpDX is able to create the devices but as soon as a VertexShader is created or a SwapChain is set up i get DXGINOTSUPPORTED or ENOINTERFACE errors. p  pI already swapped Graphics cards from a Radeon HD 5450 to a Nvidia Geforce GT 460 to no avail. The sharpdx samples run fine on another computer with Windows 7 and Intel on board graphics. Can anyone give my an idea what is going on here Why can i only use Warp and Reference drivers despite having a DirectX11 capable Graphics adapterp  pAny help is greatly appreciated. The only references i found online to such an issue was someone running the IDE inside a VM that did not have proper 3d drivers. p

I will not do things such as below...p  precodeif [dictionary.firstObject isKindOfClass [POPObject class]]      POPObject popo  [[POPObject alloc] initWithObj dictionary.firstObject]     return popo  codepre  pIm not doing this because some POPOObject will contain NSArray property that will contain other POPObjects So, maybe is better if I elaborate something of recursive... I will explain it well. Think at a JSON like thisp  precode   firstFatherObj      firstObject true,     secondObject        firstProperty  true,       secondProperty Prop        ,   httpstatus 200  codepre  pIt is a sample example, but there will be some secondthirdfourthetc... level of subclasses and it will be more expensive and really heavy. Any ideas Thanksp  h2ADDINGh2  pIm thinking about some Abstract ResponseObject that they will group more POPObject in iOS. So, when I do a call to the server, I know something about the response I will wait for. So Im going to create this Abstract and Im going to delegate it the parsing stuff to its related POPObject.  An example Im going to ask to the server some information about the logged user. I havent to check for all the POPObject that surely they are not all about emUSERem, but I instantiate the strongResponseUserstrong object that will parse the JSON and it will understand which is the suitable class ex userPosts, userPreferences and others...  What do you think about itp

Negative 3054 pA problem similar to mine is already described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4525334debugineclipseclassnotfoundexceptionDebug in Eclipse  ClassNotFoundExceptiona quite old question.p  pHowever, I the mentioned filter does not work because of ClassSubClass classes. Also, the following workarounds do not workp  ul lichecking the [x] uncaught locations checkmarkli lisetting the hit count to a high valueli ul  pI assume this has to do with another Breakpoint in the list, which I set to codejava.lang.Exceptioncode and subtypes caught and uncaught.p  pThere is also no way in eclipse to set the priority of breakpoint definitions, so that e.g. the codeClassNotFoundExceptioncode rule would be applied before the codeExceptioncode rule.p  pNext, I set a scope on the codeExceptioncode rule to apply to my packages only. But in this case, the debugger does not stop at all.p  pSo, why do I not simply stop on the one exception Im after Sometimes I dont know what Im looking for and I just want to be aware of all exceptions. Even if I know why a unit test is failing it gives me the exception type, I still dont know if thats the root cause of the problem. Also, it is more effort to create a new entry in the breakpoints window for each single exception and delete if after I fixed the problem. All in all, it would be more convenient to have a general codeExceptioncode setting and then ignore some specific ones.p  pstrongWas there any improvement in debugging in Eclipse since 2010 which I could use to make debugging more convenient and ignore all ClassNotFoundExceptionsstrong or other exceptions of a specific typep  pComing from Visual Studio, this was never an issue.p  pUsing Eclipse Luna 4.4.1p

I have removed most of the left factoring issues in the grammar, using the general rule of introducing new nonterminal characters for the same.p  pFor example,p  precodeltassignmentstatsgt lttypegtltidgtltEgt idltEgtid[ltEgt]ltEgt      codepre  pis transformed top  precodeltassignmentstatsgt lttypegtltidgtltEgt idltLF3gt ltLF3gt ltEgt[ltEgt]ltEgt codepre  pAfter applying such rules for all the required statements, I expected an unambiguous grammar.p  pBut the following statement is somehow still ambiguous.p  precodeltbodygt ltforrelatedstuffgt ltfloorsgtltstatsgt  codepre  pHere are the related statements of the grammaronly those required has been shownp  precodeltfuncbodygt ltstatsgt     ltstatsgt ltstatgt ltstatsgt         ltfloorsgt ltfloorgtltfloorsgt       ltfloorgt floo ltidgtltarrgtstatsidltarrgtltstatsgt      ltstatgt ltsuperstatsgtltreturnstatsgt ltsuperstatsgt lttypegtidltZipgtidltLF3gt   ltbuildinggt  build ltidgt ltbodygt    ltreturnstatsgt return ltEgt   codepre  pI looked more into it , and found that the ambiguity is between floors and stats. The FIRSTstats and FIRSTfloors, i.e. the set of first terminal characters contain id and  for both.p  pI can see why this would be a problem and how left factoring could solve this.But how can I remove such kind of ambiguity through left factoringp  pNote Here,  id denotes an identifier.p  p denotes epsilon.p

Negative 3054 pI have a bunch of html pages. The idea is to allow users enter keywords to search through these html pages. only html pages that match the criteria will be store for later references. I knew that Elastic search can index html,pdf, and more but in my case I already have postgresql as my database and my system is small enough so I dont want to have Elasticsearch as extra dependency for this project.p  pA few issues I have here herep  ul lipbecause html wont be stored unless the query match the users keywords, is there a better approach to handle this without having had to index html first to the search engine to be able to search and remove it afterward if it doesnt match the criteria pli lipyes is it possible to index whole html content like in Elasticsearch pli ul  pThanks a lot for your help p

I cannot find the reason. Do i need BIOflush I would really appreciate you even just give me some inspirations to work this out.p  hr  pwell, my program is too complicated to show. I was asked to add ssl to rpcz to improve its security I dont know if rpcz is popular enough for most people to know. In my word ,it combines zeromq,protobuf and rpc to realize remote procedure call.

So I use sslgeterror to check the error number, it returns SSLERRORSYSCALL, and for the next data received,it returns SSLERRORWANTREAD.p  phope that someone can help to explain why sslread returns these code I think if the ssl connection does not handshake successfully, sslwrite wont return a positive number.

It was helpful to have them in place when I was using the Visual Studio datasource designer and dropping them on the Winform. Another reason is that there can be multiple BoxInfo data records to that OrderID. For example, when the product comes back for a service or a repair, a new BoxInfo is required along with the rest of the data records ie Widget and CheckList for historical purposes. Im hoping that the foreign keys will keep the data tight when navigating through the database.p  pBut the problem is, OrderDetailsBindingSource creates TWO records at a time and the OrderID is set at 2, and that means the data is not being populated at all. Same for the other bindingsources they are not updating at all. I checked with Management Studio and only the two OrderDetails records are created and incremented correctly, but no data is being saved. The same goes for the other tables. No data is being committed at all.p  pIf I remove the BoxInfoBindingSource.DataMember to NONE, then it will work properly, but the BoxInfoBindingSource will show ALL records, but I want it to show what is currently being shown by the OrderDetailsBindingSource. And also, when being updated to the database, the current BoxInfo.OrderID is set at null. My idea or a workaround would be set the BoxInfo.OrderID  OrderDetails.OrderID. But my problem will be is when a new order is created and the OrderID is set at 2.p  pSo what am I doing wrong Why isnt the other datarows being created, or are they being created and did I lose a stepp  pstrongNOTE I know it is in Visual Basic, but I dont mind if you answer in Cstrongp

Negative 3054 pI am trying to figure out the optimum way to use maven on a CI server that has hundreds of jobs most more or less related to each other that use a lot of the same common libraries, plugins, etc.  They are all run by the same user, so by default they all share the same repo at code.m2repositorycode.  However, on a build server this is badespecially when many multimodule builds need to perform a codemvn installcode so that post build steps will work correctly, empost builds steps that may ultimately fail the build and decide not to do codemvn deploycode.em  p  pWhat I think I want is something like how eclipse works, or how mutlimodule projects work with a single reactor runyou can resolve all the dependencies without them actually being installed.  Short of that, I would like to have two sets of local repositories, one from which to resolve all deployed packages and one into which I can install the current builds artifacts such that post build steps can resolve dependencies from both giving priority to the latter.p  pAll of this said, what I am really interested in is a working solution whether it works along these lines or not, for the requirements of needing to do local installs but not wanting every job to have its own full repo due to the tremendous file system bloat that would entaila single repo could be in excess of 2GB even with all old snapshots cleaned out.p  pIt seems this would be a common problem and that a lot of busy CI servers would encounter and that there would at least one typical solution, but I cant seem to find anything.

I am able to understand that I have to solve TSP for this with dynamic programming approach but I am unable to exactly understand that whether my approach for handling multiple parcel between same pair of cities is correct or not. My pseudocode will be somewhat as followingp  precode1 Use floyd warshall to find all pair shortest path in On3. Some pair of cities are connected by more than one roads, I can just keep the shortest one for my undirected graph. 2 Add the shortest cost for each request start to end. 3 Create a new directed graph for each of 12 requests and homecity. The node of this new graph will be a merge of each requests source and destination. The edge weight between agtb can be calculated by shortest path between a requests destination to b requests source.I am thinking of duplicating the pairs if I have multiple request between them. 4 Use a TSP DP to solve this new undirected 13 city TSP problem. On2 2n would come around 1384448. Not sure whether this will time out for multiple test cases. codepre  pCan you please give your inputs as am I complicating the problem with my approach of creating this new directed graph I am not using the information that there are only 5 such different requests.

This usually works fine for me, but I now have a situation where I need to project from two different database objects e.g. something like thisp  precodepublic class MyCompositeDTO      public string User1Forename  get set      public string User1Surname  get set      public string User2Forename  get set      public string User2Surname  get set    simplified example to demonstrate my question IQueryableltMyCompositeDTOgt matchingUsers  from u1 in context.MyUserDBObjects                                            join u2 in context.MyUserDBObjects on u1.Surname equals u2.Surname                                            select new MyCompositeDTO                                                                                            User1Forename  u1.Forename,                                                User1Surname  u1.Surname,                                                User2Forename  u2.Forename,                                                User2Surname  u2.Surname                                             codepre  pIn the above example I can easily create the projection within the original linq query as I have both u1 and u2 available at that point. But is there some way I can separate the projection into a different function as I have done in the first example and keep it as an IQueryable There isnt a foreign key linking the two source records.p

Negative 3054 pIm coming from the angularjs world and am having trouble writing a component that can communicate upwards amongst other ancestor components. Here is an examplep  precodemenus   menuscontent     closemenu Button to close menu   menuscontent   othermenusrelatedstuff menus codepre  pI want the codeclosemenucode component to be used potentially anywhere in the page markup, and when clicked to trigger some logic within the codemenuscode component. There is likely a better approach than communicating only amongst components, however it seems wrong to me to bother controllers and routes with any of this logic. In angular, for example, I would request the parent directive and then use its interface to trigger the menu close. p

Negative 3054 pI have a 1master, 7slave elasticsearch setup on amazon ec2. Recently the ec2 instance on which the master nodeversion 1.5.2 was hosted failed and all applications were shutdown. It has since been restarted and its stable, but this failure has somehow affected the master node. Each time elasticsearch is started on the master node, it receives an anonymous shutdown request and proceeds to shutdown. There is no error message of any sort, just the log statement indicating that a shutdown request was received.

Negative 3054 pI was looking for a solution to this problem on stackoverflow but since I couldnt find the accurate solution I ended up solving it myself and post it here, hope it help.p  pGoogle Maps provides you the Polyline feature, which based on a list of coordinates can draw a series of lines joining all of them.p  pYou can draw a polyline with a single arrow with the following codep  precode     var allCoordinates  [         new google.maps.LatLng26.291, 148.027,         new google.maps.LatLng26.291, 150.027,         new google.maps.LatLng22.291, 153.027,         new google.maps.LatLng18.291, 153.027     ]       var polyline  new google.maps.Polyline             path allCoordinates,             strokeColor color,             strokeOpacity 1.0,             strokeWeight 2,             geodesic true,             icons [                 icon path google.maps.SymbolPath.FORWARDCLOSEDARROW,                 offset 100             ]          codepre  pThe problem here is that the arrow will be only drawn in the last segment as shown in the next picture, but sometimes the route could be not so straightforward and we need to add an arrow on every segment.p  pThe attribute repeat inside the icon definition could be another option but allows only to define a measure in pixels and that definelty wont match with every change of direction on the polyline.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc5a3x.png altPICTURE1p  pSo, one way I found to achive this was to make several polylines, one per segment allowing in that case the arrow to be drawn on each one. This is the codep  precode     var allCoordinates  [         new google.maps.LatLng26.291, 148.027,         new google.maps.LatLng26.291, 150.027,         new google.maps.LatLng22.291, 153.027,         new google.maps.LatLng18.291, 153.027     ]      for var i  0, n  allCoordinates.length i lt n i           var coordinates  new Array         for var j  i j lt i2 ampamp j lt n j              coordinates[ji]  allCoordinates[j]                   var polyline  new google.maps.Polyline             path coordinates,             strokeColor color,             strokeOpacity 1.0,             strokeWeight 2,             geodesic true,             icons [                 icon path google.maps.SymbolPath.FORWARDCLOSEDARROW,                 offset 100             ]                  polyline.setMapmap         polylines.pushpolyline       codepre  pAnd this is the Picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzfzWF.png altPICTURE2p  pI hope this works for anyone who is looking for something like thisp
