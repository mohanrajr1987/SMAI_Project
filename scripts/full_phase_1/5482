Positive 5482 pI am trying to use pthread to set priorities and scheduling policies. I modified a simple socket downloadable online, with a server and several clients. These clients are simply sending a string to the server. The server is creating a new thread for each client connecting and is setting a higher priority to every new connection, which means the last client connected is the one with the highest priority. The result I am expecting is that the thread with highest priority is the one printing out till that client is connected, while the others should wait.p  pAnyway this is not the result I am getting, the threads are still executed anyway, even the ones with lower priorities. I even tried several configurations, for instance using pthreadjoin, but in this case the scheduler will wait till that thread has finished its execution, which is wrong if another thread with higher priority is called in my example another client connecting, since it should release the CPU to this newly created thread.p  pHere is the codep  precodeinclude ltsystypes.hgt include ltsyssocket.hgt include ltnetinetin.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltpthread.hgt include ltsched.hgt include ltsystime.hgt  define PORTNUMBER 8888  int prioInit  30 global variable to initialize priority  struct serverParm          int connectionDesc   function used to increase priority to new threads void addPrioint prio    prio  prio  10   void serverThreadvoid parmPtr     define PARMPTR struct serverParm  parmPtr   int recievedMsgLen   char messageBuf[1025]    struct schedparam PriorityParam struct to set priority   int policySCHEDFIFO kind of policy desired, either SCHEDFIFO or SCHEDRR, otherwise Linux uses SCHEDOTHER     Server thread code to deal with message processing   printfDEBUG connection made, connectionDescdn,         PARMPTRgtconnectionDesc    pthreadt selfid pthreadself  I ask for the tid..

Positive 5482 pMy goal is to create an event handling infrastructure that will allow for registration of callback functions and calls to such functions based on time. Further, I plan to make the callback handler multithreaded as there are no restrictions on the type of callbacks, so a sequential architecture could cause unwanted blocking.p  pFrom my research I found that if a thread experiences undefined behavior and is terminated .i.e. with SIGSEGV then the entire process exits  which is obviously undesirable. p  pThe question, then, is what options are there for ensuring thread independence I do not think codeforkcodeing is a viable  option in this case since the callbacks are not fully fledged programs, but rather simple routines to do various timebased tasks.p

Positive 5482 pI am getting a data race when calling pthreadcreate recursively. I dont know if the recursion causes the problem, but the race seems to never occur on the first iteration, mostly on the second and rarely on the third.p  pWhen using libgc, there are memory corruption symptoms, such as segmentation fault, that coincide with the the data race.p  pThe following program is a minimal example that illustrates the problem. Im not using libgc in the example as only the data race is the topic of this question.p  pThe data race is visible when running Valgrind with the Helgrind tool.

Positive 5482 pI am trying to learn programming with pthreads and here is a problem that I am trying to solve.

Once the first one is done, it would post to the second one, and when second one is done it will signal the third and so on until all the elements in the array are traversed. p  pHowever, when I try to run the following program, it segfaults.

Positive 5482 pShort version of the question I have 2 functions that share the same array, when one is editing it, the other is reading it. However, the vector is long 5000 samples and concurrent access rarely happens. but the Mutex contention on codeMUTEX1code is slowing down the program. p  pHow can I lock certain locations of the memory instead of the complete block in order to reduce contentionp  pEDIT Note I have to use updated G values whenever possible. p  pEDIT2  For example I have array G of length 5000. codefoo1code locks codemutex1code to edit index 124.  Although codefoo2code wants to edit index 2349, it cannot until codefoo1code releases codemutex1code. p  pis there a way I can move the contention of locking a mutex down to the element level meaning I want codefoo2code and codefoo1code to only contest on a the same mutex, only when they want to edit the same index. E.g codefoo1code wants to edit index 3156, and codefoo2code wants to edit index 3156.p  pLong version with code explanation  I am writing a code for a complex mathematical function,  and I am using pthreads to parallel the code and enhance the performance. The code is very complex and I can post it but I can post a model to the code.  p  pBasically I have 2 arrays that I want to edit using 2 threads that run in parallel. One thread runs codefoo1code and the other runs codefoo2code.  However, they should run in a particular sequence and I use codemutexcodeescodeBcode,codeA1code, and codeA2code to grantee the sequence. it goes as follows p  precodefoo1 first half foo2 first half and foo1 second half in parallel foo1 first half and foo2 second half in parallel ... foo2second half codepre  pthen I would retrieve my results. In the first half of codefoo1code I will be using results in codeG1code that is might be edited at the same time by codefoo2code.  Therefore I use codeMutex1code to protect it. same happens in codefoo2code for codeGcode.  However, locking the complete vector for 1 value is very in efficient, they nearly never edit the same memory location at the same time. when I compare the results, it is almost always the same. I would like a way to lock one element at a time, so that they only contest the same element.p  pI will describe the code for people interested to know how it works p  precodeinclude ltpthread.hgt include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  define numThreads 2 define Length 10000  pthreadt threads[numThreads]  pthreadmutext mutex1    PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER pthreadmutext MutexB   PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER pthreadmutext MutexA1  PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER pthreadmutext MutexA2  PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER  struct datapointers      double  A     double  B     double  G     double  L     int idxThread   void foo1   datapointers ampdata void foo2   datapointers ampdata  void threadfuncvoid arg     datapointers data  datapointers  arg     if data.idxThread0         foo1 data     else         foo2 data  codepre  pUp to here it is definitions and thread calling function, bare in mind that I define codeLength 10000code and codenumThreads 2codep  precodevoid foo1  datapointers ampdata      double A            data.A     double L            data.L      double G            data.G      double U      for int ijk 0ijklt5ijk          here goes some definitions          pthreadmutexlockampMutexA1          for int k 0kltLengthk             pthreadmutexlockampmutex1              U  G[k]             pthreadmutexunlockampmutex1             U undergoes a lot of mathematical operations here                                  pthreadmutexlockampMutexB         pthreadmutexunlockampMutexA2         for int k 0kltLengthk             U another mathematical operations here                            pthreadmutexlockampmutex1             L[k]  U             pthreadmutexunlockampmutex1             pthreadmutexunlockampMutexB                codepre  pin foo1 I lock codemutexA1code and complete my work,  then I lock codeMutexBcode and unlock codeMutexA2code so codefoo2code can start working.

No point in abasing myself if its not technically possible.  p  pstrongEDITstrong We do have the network infrastructure set up to allow directed broadcast, though figuring out the exact broadcast address since netmasks are not always 24 is another conundrum that I need to solve.p

Negative 5482 pIm currently working on a Level of detail system for an XNA game, the system subdivides triangles with high emscreen space errorem and merges triangles with low emscreen space errorem.p  pemWorldem Space Error is a heuristic which estimates the error that this triangle has, so for example if there is a triangle which is on an almost flat surface, itll have a very low screen space error because its a very good approximation of that surface, however if there is a triangle on the surface of a sphere itll have a higher screen space error because obviously splitting that triangle up into more triangles would get a better approximation of a spherical surface.br  emScreenem Space Error is a slight modification of World Space Error, basically the error is modified so triangles closer to the camera, and closer to the centre of the field of view have a higher error score.p  pWhat is a good and efficient way to calculate screen space errorp  pCurrent Solution Screen Space Error  World Space Error  dot[vector to triangle in question], [camera direction vector]p  pa hrefhttpmartindevans.appspot.comblogpermaagxtYXJ0aW5kZXZhbnNyEAsSCEJsb2dQb3N0GLmUAQw relnofollowBlog post about screen space errorap

Negative 5482 pIm trying to improve the graph drawing control that comes with Graph. Its good, but things get out of hand when you start dragging nodes around. This is my first encounter with WPF, so this is probably a newbie question. p  pI have the GraphCanvas control which has nodes and edges on it. They can be dragged around which changes their coordinates, possibly making them negative. I would like to add scrollbars to the control which would allow to see how big the canvas really is.p  pTo this end Im thinking of putting the GraphCanvas inside a ScrollViewer. Which would be pretty easy and straightforward if not for one problem. I may not resize the GraphCanvas itself when a node is dragged outside the borders or this will mess up dragging bad. That is also the problem with the original control check it out, it comes with a sample application.p  pIt would be good if I could bind the scrollbar sizelocation to properties of the GraphCanvas, so that the ScrollViewer would not scroll anything physically, but just set the properties of GraphCanvas. That in turn would perform all actual calculations and scrolling.p  pHow can this be donep

Each row will have a window seat, aisle seat, aisle seat and window seat WA AW Just like seat arrangement in airplane. At each iteration different set of passengers, there would be some number of passengers between 1 and 12 and I need to seat them closest together possible Seat together. And I do this for next group each iteration until program stops It will stop when I am done with every group.p  pFor example, I have 3 passengers A,B,and C and A wants to seat in Window, B wants to seat in Aisle and C wants to seat in Window. Assuming that all the seats all 12 are available, I could place them like A BC or CB A and mark the seats dirty so I dont pick same seats again for next passengers. And I do this for next group iteration.  I am not sure if this right forum, but if somebody can advise me how I should accomplish, I would really appreciate it.br Thanks.p

Negative 5482 pI need to write an application that will take a list of files some large, some small and fit them onto DVDs or CDs, or whatever as efficiently as possible.  The whole point of this application is to use up as much of the 1st disc before moving onto the 2nd disc, filling the 2nd disc up as much as possible before moving onto the 3rd disc, etc.p  pNote  The application doesnt have to do the actual burning to the DVD, it just has to figure out the best possible fit.p  pI initially thought I had a good gameplan by generating a permutation of the files and then checking each combination to see what fits the best. My request for help on this can be found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3825163cneedtogenerateeveryuniquecombinationofanarrayoffilesrecursivelyHEREap  pBut the more files there are, the longer it takes... exponentially.

Negative 5482 pI store all of Gallios binaries needed for a project in a SVN repository. Ive been using Gallio for several years now and its an excellent library. p  pThe only real and unique problem with Gallio is that it is strongverystrong bloated, with dozens of assemblies and other files that come in the package. In the very latest release 3.2.603 I counted strong1041 filesstrong, and thats just the codebincode directory. The package includes plugins for AutoCAD, for example, which I think 99.5 of people have no need for and I think should be part of some other, addon package and not the main one.p  pAlthough in the past I managed to manually extract the stuff I needed for my work and add it to the version control, it becomes a real PITA to later upgrade it to a newer version  the subdirectory structure changes, files change and you never really know what files are the bare necessities and what files can safely be removed.p  pSo basically, Im looking for a way to make this simpler. Lets say I need the following functionality from Galliop  ol liBasic test framework.li liGallio.Echo as the command line runner. GUI runner is not really necessary to be included in the SVN.li liVisualStudio integration if anyli liTestDriven.NET integration if any.li ol  pIs there a sure way to extract only the files needed to cover the above p

Negative 5482 pI read a little of CLang implementation of standard library and it confuses me a little bit on const and constexpr.p  precodetemplateltclass Tp, Tp vgt struct integralconstant      static constexpr Tp value  v   templateltclass Tp, Tp vgt const Tp integralconstantltTp, vgtvalue codepre  pWhat makes me confusing is that, it is using constexpr inside class definition and const outside. My question is, is that allowed And under what situation const and constexpr can me be used interchangingly Of course constexpr functions cannot apply to const, so I am talking about const data and constexpr data.p  pI did read some standard draft and the proposal in  a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2007n2235.pdfhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2007n2235.pdfa, but it makes me feel more confusing. So I have some more questions,p  pIn N2235, it clearly states that, const data are not guaranteed to be a compile time constants, see the following example,p  precodestruct S  static const int size  const int limit  2  Ssize  dynamic initialization const int Ssize  256 codepre  pand constexpr is supposed to solve this, so at least under this situation, constexpr is not allowed as below,p  precodestruct S  static const int size  constexpr int limit  2  Ssize  shall be error in my understanding const int Ssize  256 codepre  pHowever, after reading C standard draft N3225, I see nowhere explicitly stated that the above example shall cause an error. Particularly, from 7.1.59,p  blockquote   pA constexpr specifier used in an   object declaration declares the object   as const. Such an object shall have   literal type and shall be initialized.   If it is initialized by a constructor   call, the constructor shall be a   constexpr constructor and every   argument to the constructor shall be a   constant expression. that call shall   be a constant expression 5.19.   Otherwise, every fullexpression that   appears in its initializer shall be a   constant expression.p blockquote  pTherefore, if constexpr int limit  2  Ssize is invalid, then Ssize must not be an constant expression, then from 5.19 constant expression, I see nowhere the standard disallow 2  Ssize in the above example to not be a constant expression.p  pCan anybody point out anything I have overlooked Thank you very much.p

Negative 5482 pHey everybody,br Im writing a small social networking app, and one of the features I included is the ability to upload a picture to a server to be used as your profile picture.

My question is, how can I say something likep  precodeintent.setTypeimagejpeg codepre  pbecause I only want users to upload jpegsp  pThanks so much in advancep
Negative 5482 pI have a number of classes that I cannot modify.  Each has a copy constructor, at least one other constructor, and a function codefoocode that returns some value.

Negative 5482 pI am running a server program, written in C running on PASE on an iSeries machine.  PASE Portable AIX Solutions Environment is a simulation of AIX on IBM iSeries machines.p  pServer program is a connection oriented iterative tcp server. p  pServer logic contains call to accept which returns a socket descriptor. This is followed by call to ioctl to set the socket non blocking using FIONBIO.p  pThis call to ioctl fails intermittently, returns 1 with errno  9 EBADF  bad file descriptor ,  for approximately 0.8 percent of the times it is called. Once it fails for a particular socket descriptor,  the next failures are always for the same socket descriptor and with same errno.p  pWhen this happens, client side fails with errno  73, i.e. connection reset by peer.p  pThe server is a daemon process so stdin is closed on initialization, and is available on accept.  Initially I observed that ioctl failed for socket descriptor 0, but not always. Hence, I tried to prevent reuse of socket descriptor 0 by setting stdin to devnull, in case that was the issue. But I am not sure if this was the main issue. Yet to get the test results after this change.p  pIssue has been observed only on some machines, and usually when machine is loaded. So this seems to be some sort of a race condition. Server logic is well tested and seems to be stable. p  pHave any socket related issues been observed on PASE or AIX platform Could this be OS relatedp  pAny helppointers with this issue would be appreciated.p  pthanks in advance,p  pavgp

Negative 5482 pI have a Java application that parses pdf files in a directory and its subdirectories and creates a database using the information found in the files.p  pEverything was fine when I was using the program on around 900 files or so which create a SQLite database with multiple tables, some of wihch contain 150k rows.p  pNow Im trying to run my program on a larger set of data around 2000 files and at some point I get OutOfMemoryError Java Heap space. I changed the following line in my jdev.conf filep  precodeAddVMOption  XXMaxPermSize256M codepre  pto 512M and I got the same error though later, I think. Im going to change it to something bigger again, but the thing is the computers this program will be used on are much older and thus dont have as much memory. Normally, the users are not going to add more than 30 files at a time, but I want to know at how many files Im supposed to limit them to. Ideally, Id like my program not to throw an error regardless of how many files are to be parsed.p  pAt first, I thought it was my SQLite queries that were causing the error, but after reading up on Google, its probably some recursive function. I isolated it I think its the correct one at least, to this functionp  precode public static void visitAllDirsAndFilesFile dir        ifdir.isDirectory                 String[] children  dir.list         for int i0 iltchildren.length i                     visitAllDirsAndFilesnew Filedir, children[i]                       else                try                              BowlingFilesReader.readFiledir                  catchException exc                    exc.printStackTrace           System.out.printlnOther Exception in file   dir                    codepre  pI think the problem might be that it recursively calls this function for each subsequent directory, but Im really not sure that could be the problem. What do you think If it might be, how can I make it so I dont get this error again If you think it is impossible that this section alone causes the problem, Ill try to find which other part of the program can cause it.p  pThe only other thing I can see causing that is that I connect to the database before calling the above method and I disconnect after it returns. The reason for that is that if I connect and disconnect after each file, my programs takes a lot longer to parse the data, so Id really like not to have to change that.p

Negative 5482 pI am consistently finding that my alreadyexisting transaction is getting committed inside any method of an EJB marked codeejb.transactioncode codetypeRequiredcode. Can this be correct  p  pMy expectation is, an EJB requiring a transaction means if theres one already there, it will politely leave it uncommitted when done so that whoever invoked begin can continue to use it for further operations before invoking codecommitcode or coderollbackcode. [Of course, if there was no transaction in the first place, then the EJB method would invoke both codebegincode and codecommitcodecoderollbackcode.]p  pIs my expectation wrong, or should I be looking for a configuration bugp  pIt might be relevant to add that Im using Hibernate 3 inside the EJB. Im obtaining a UserTransaction before calling the EJB method. The EJB generated wrapper invokes codeServerTransaction.commitcode on exit, which Hibernate hooks into and uses the opportunity to close its Session. The error Im getting is a Hibernate lazy loading exception, because the session is closed when I try to access getters on a Hibernatepersisted object. So technically, Im not 100 sure whether the codeServerTransaction.commitcode I observed necessarily committed the codeUserTransactioncode I started maybe codeServerTransaction.commitcode doesnt always actually follow through with a real commit, but if it did not  then on what basis is Hibernate closing the Sessionp  pstrongUpdatestrong emI believe my assumptions above were correct, but my observations were a bit off.

Otherwise, if I commit and push .hgsub from Machine A say, and then pull from Machine B, I automatically get the dev subrepo as well as the www subrepo that I dont want.p  pSo I modify .hgsub again on Machine B to only have www and commit it for it to take effect. I do some work in the www subrepo on Machine B and want to push back out to the central repo, but it will also push out the change to .hgsub. Now when I pull on Machine A, my dev subrepo is gone and I have to add it back to .hgsub again, and I go back and forth like this until I pull my hair out in frustration.p  pIs there any way to get around this .hgsub must be locally committed on each machine in order for the subrepos to work, but I dont want them to be pushed or pulled. Is there a .hgignore for pushpullp  pcheers.p

Negative 5482 pI have two interfacesp  precodeinterface IDynamicControl      string Id  get set      string Label  get set      string Value  get set    interface IDynamicList  IDynamicControl      IList ListItems  get set   codepre  pI have a codeControlResolvercode class that returns codeIDynamicControlcode  for my purposes I have wrapper classes for ASP.NET TextBoxes, CheckBoxes and DropDownLists which implement IDynamicControl DropDown implements IDynamicList.  The gist is I can give the resolver the name of a control, for example Textbox, and it will give me back an IDynamicControl that is a modified ASP.NET Textbox.p  pThis works perfect BUT the issue is the DropDownList.  Maybe Im having a brain fart but the problem Im running into is that when the control is a dropdown, Im having to do an explicit cast to IDynamicList since the resolver returns IDynamicControl so I can add the items to it for display.  This normally wouldnt be an issue but the purpose of the dynamic control is that I can store the field type externally and read it in, so I would have to do something ugly likep  precodestring controlType  SomeService.GetControlType if controlType  dropdown      var control  IDynamicListControlResolver.ResolveControlcontrolType      set up list items  else      var control  ControlResolver.ResolveControlcontrolType      stuff with normal controls  codepre  pbut this seems fairly ugly.  I could include the ListItems property in the base and just throw NotImplemented in the classes that dont use it, but that violates ISP and is even smellier than the if statement.  In short Id like to have my resolver return one type of control so I dont need to have different Resolve methods, but in the consuming code there is extra work I have to do if, and only if, the control is a dropdown.p  pUnless Im mistaken or Ive forgotten something basic, is there a better solution for doing this or should I just use the if statement  I cant use a base class since all of my Dynamic classes inherit from the base ASP.NET UI classes.p

Negative 5482 pIm trying to write a signal handler to catch any number of consecutive SIGINT signals and prevent the program from exiting.  The program is a simple file server.

So I would like to know what my alternatives are.p  pMy use case is as follows My application listens for an event, and when this event occurs, it displays an alert dialog, even if the user is in the midst of using another application. From other a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2147144androidhowtodisplayadialogoveranativescreenquestionsa I found that the common way of doing this is to launch an activity with singleInstance launch mode. But now once this alert dialog pops up, I need to use RecognizerIntent and do some speech to text processing. However speech input dialog just does not wait for any input and onActivityResult is called immediately. Things work fine if my alert dialog pops up from an activity which has a launch mode other than singleInstance.p  pAre there other ways to approach this problem p

Negative 5482 pI have a couple of other questions on here surrounding this area but they are a bit redundant now. Any answers to them would also be appreciated but this question is my main concern at the minute.p  pI have followed lots of examples of how MTOMXOP works in WSE 3.0 and have set up my project exactly as it seems is required. I have a Byte array field that is designated as DataTypebase64Binary. In this I put the Byte array of the attachment I want to add. When I run the application and check the request, the data is encoded inline as base64, i.e. without the XOP Include element and associated MIME part.p  pMy understanding of MTOM within WSE 3.0 was that, when encoding it will take any field designated as base64Binary and encode it as binary and move it to a MIME part, replacing it with an XOP Include element. That is to say, it just worked. But I have set the service, in the Reference file, to inherit codeMicrosoft.Web.Services3.WebServicesClientProtocolcode and have set the codeRequireMtomcode flag to true, and it is still not encoding correctly.p  pHave I missed something here Is there any other steps that should be implemented for this to workp  pEDIT After looking through my code for the 100th time, I am wondering if it might be due to the fact that I have to serialise the payload before running the ProcessMessage method. Does this sound like it could be a problem The reason we have serialised is because the method we have to use accepts a Payload parameter which has a content property, this content property is an XMLElement property and the only way we can get this is to serialise the required class. But does this stop the MTOM recognising the data type of the base64 field and therefore not converted to binary with the MIME parts and XOP Just really clutching at straws now.p  pEDIT 2 While I have a solution below, the third party company are now saying that our namespace prefixes are wrong We have something like codeltq1Attachment xmlnsq1httpwhatever gtcode and they are demanding it be codeltsAttachment xmlnsshttpwhatever gtcode. Am I going mad or does that not matter Is there a way I can tell it how to assign the namespace prefixesp

Negative 5482 pI have a handful of view controllers that inherit from a subclass of UIViewController, we will call it strongSpecialViewControllerstrong.

I found out that some Security.level settings etc. might affect these, but tips are not very precise...p  pIn user authentication, I would like to disable automatic log out or at least make a long timeout for active logged in user. Any advices or howtoguides how to change auto log out behaviour without changing the cake core not intended anyway...p

Negative 5482 pFollowind describes an issue I am running into using EF 4.2 and LINQ.  Ive tried this on multiple systems, and multiple flavors of SQL SQL Express and SQL 2008 R2 Sp1, VS 2010 Pro and Premium, both in 64 bit and 32 binaries, both with the debugger, and attempting to run the binary directly.  Im wondering what Ive stumbled against, if its an issue with EF, or more likely an issue with my code and Im missing some nuance either related to LINQ or EF.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, been at it for 6 hours, my Google JuJu is not strong enough Im afraid.p  pI have a simple model named session consisting of an ID Guid, Name String, and Timestamp DateTime.  I am able to add a session to the dbcontext, and have verified in debugging that the session record is indeed stored in the database.  The timestamp used to create the session object is stored in a local variable, and immediately after storing, I attempt to retrieve the session into a new instance of a session object.  The code that retrieves the session LINQ throws System.InvalidOperationException Sequence contains no elements with the following stacktracep  precodeat System.Linq.Enumerable.First[TSource]IEnumerable1 source at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.ltGetElementFunctiongtb0[TResult]IEnumerable1 sequence at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.ExecuteSingle[TResult]IEnumerable1 query, Expression queryRoot at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.System.Linq.IQueryProvider.Execute[S]Expression expression at System.Data.Entity.Internal.Linq.DbQueryProvider.Execute[TResult]Expression expression at System.Linq.Queryable.First[TSource]IQueryable1 source at efwtf.Program.MainString[] args in dvs2010efwtfefwtfProgram.csline 19 at System.AppDomain.nExecuteAssemblyRuntimeAssembly assembly, String[] args at System.AppDomain.ExecuteAssemblyString assemblyFile, Evidence assemblySecurity, String[] args at Microsoft.VisualStudio.HostingProcess.HostProc.RunUsersAssembly at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStartContextObject state at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean ignoreSyncCtx at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart codepre  pI am able to drill into ctx.Sessions in the debugger and see in the resultset that the session that I am trying to retrieve actually does exist, and if I iterate over the result set and manually compare the two timestamps I can extract the session as expected.  If I run the code and pass a timestamp value for a record that was added to the database in a previous run, it works.  I can find work arounds, worst case, changing the datatype to a string perhaps, but it bugs me that this doesnt work, Im assuming, which may be part of the problem, that the functionality should be supported.

Negative 5482 pSuppose I am doing an async connection to a web service, which by definition since it is async runs in a separate thread from the main thread. p  pNow lets say I put this job or block of code in a serial dispatch queue. Since serial dispatch queues dont process more than 1 job at a time, but I am sending a job that is already async, would it then consider the job to be done after the call to the async job is made or would it actually wait for the async job to get done before processing the next job.p  pWhat about a concurrent queue, would the concurrent generated thread, generate yet another thread to process the async operationp  pEDIT I realize my question is not really clear, so my question isp  pIf I am using the same serial dispatch queue, and i dispatch using dispatchasync a block of code that already performs an async operation for example a NSURLConnection  initWithRequestdelegate that runs async, will the block be considered completed by the serial queue after the async call, and will that async call generate yet another thread.

Negative 5482 pIve been looking for a way to send a message across desktops. I first tried using PostMessage but later found that it cannot send messages across desktops.

Can someone suggest an alternative approach to send messages across desktopsp  pThanksp

Negative 5482 pBasically what Im trying to achieve is making a one pager for my website. Basically there is an index page, and, for example, if someone clicks on Services it will send them to the services page. This services page will display 5 or 6 services, all in one page. So basically when the user clicks on a navigation item, it scrolls using jQuery to the div where the information is displayed.p  pNow what I dont want is the user to see the section below the one hes  shes actually reading. So for example I have a service called Edition and another Conception. If Im reading the Edition section, I dont want to see the Conception just right now, unless I scroll to it. My first thought was using margins, but I mean if Im on a 1024x768 display the margin would not be the same as a 1920x1080.p  pSo basically, Im looking for a way to display my content for my services on one page, but each different service is displayed so, unless the visitor scrolls, the next section under it is not seen.p  pHope it makes sense, and thanks for any support and helpp

Negative 5482 pCould someone please help me with the following problemp  pYesterday I was trying to add a process to my ANT script Windows XP, ANT version 1.8.2, mostly XSLT 2.0, Saxon 9 simply added to my antlib whereby it converts a directory of SVGs to PDFs using Batiks rasterizertask. Initially I had a lot of trouble getting ANT to recognize the rasterizertask but after reinstalling Batik from source and with the help of the following link I was able to get it to work.p  pa hrefhttpsmailarchives.apache.orgmodmboxxmlgraphicsbatikusers200605.mbox3C445B43B9.4010403harcotechnology.com3E relnofollowhttpsmailarchives.apache.orgmodmboxxmlgraphicsbatikusers200605.mbox3C445B43B9.4010403harcotechnology.com3Eap  pThough these instructions did not state to do so, I found I needed to recompilerebuild the rasterizertask.jar.p  pAs a side note, I had also already added the path to the batikrasterizer.jar and rasterizertask classes to my CLASSPATH as recommended on the official Batik site. p  pAnd voila, I had the rasterizer task working.

Negative 5482 pI am running a very basic test to check my understanding and evaluate neo4j REST server neo4jcommunity1.8.M07. I am using Neo4j Python a hrefhttpneo4jrestclient.readthedocs.org relnofollowREST Clienta.p  pEach test iteration starts with a random strings for the source node name and the destination node name. The names contain only letters codea..zcode and numbers code0..9code oddly enough, I never got it to fail if I use codeA..Zcode and code0..9code. The name may be from one char to 36 chars long and there are no repeating chars. I create 36 nodes, where the 1st node name is only one char long and the 36th node name has 36 chars. Then I create relations between all nodes. The name of each relation is the concatenation of the source node name and the destination node name. The final graph has 37 nodes 1 reference node and 36 nodes with names from one char to 36 nonrepeating chars and 1260 relations. Before each test iteration I clear the graph, so that it has only one the reference node. p  pThe problem is that after several successful iterations neo4j REST server crashesp  precodeError [500] Internal Server Error.

Negative 5482 pI develop crossplatform audio editor in C that reads media files at 0...5 times per second in playing mode or when redraw sound on screen. The implementation opens a file and keeps the descriptor opened between all the reading operations with that file.p  pI think it would be more friendly to user to not forbid any file operations even if that file is opened. I would allow user to delete that file EVEN while it is playing if heshe wants. The program would just stop playing after next failed try to read next block from that file.p  pstrongIs openclose operations are expensive on modern Windows  Linux  Mac OS systemsstrongp  pBut it would be hard to openclose huge MP3 files, because MP3s seek may be expensive reading headers of all the blocks before needed block.p
Negative 5482 pIm writing a program thats working with external data, which I cant control. This data changes over time, but I want my program to be compatible to various versions of it. In other languages Id use define to specify the version, and than use if, to do the necessary things for the specified version. Likep  precodeif VERSION gt 5     ... endif codepre  pI know this isnt possible in C, since it only allows to define symbols, but not assign something to them. So Im wondering, whats the best way to accomplish this I could define things like VERSION5, but Id rather be able to check specific versions, and especially emrangesem, which would be annoying like this. The next best thing I can think of is const, but that would have to be checked on runtime, which might slow down things a tiny little bit. Im not sure if it would even be noticeable in my project, but Im worried about it.p  pIs there a standard way to do this in C Whats the best wayp

Negative 5482 pIm attempting to put in a temporary workaround for a race condition in a java server using hibernate. The code initially looks like thisp  precodes  sessionFactory.openSession Object o1  dao.getMostRecentVersionOfObjectkey, s if o1.performSomeTimeConsumingTask  Looks.Ok      Transaction t  s.beginTransaction     dao.updateo1, s     t.commit  codepre  pThe original problem is that if 2 different threads get to the same block of code at roughly the same time, they will both try and get the same version of the object, so the second one will always fail. Since there are multiple, load balanced servers, the real solution to this problem is to use a distributed locking system to make sure that versions are kept in sync and that transactions dont tread on each others toes.  However, since users are already finding this to be a problem and a long term solution to this problem will take time to develop, I made the executive decision to add a temporary hack by checking to see if the object has been updated just before the transaction starts. I created a second session to perform this version check. If theres been an update I use the second session to populate the objects fields then save it. So the new code looks a little like thisp  precodeSession s  sessionFactory.openSession Session transactionSession  s Object o1  dao.getMostRecentVersionOfObjectkey, s int version  o1.getVersion if o1.performSomeTimeConsumingTask  Looks.Ok      Session newerSession  sessionFactory.openSession     Object newerObject  dao.getMostRecentVersionOfObjectkey, newerSession     if newerObject.getVersion gt version           update fields...         transactionSession  newSession       Transaction t  transactionSession.beginTransaction dao.updateo1, transactionSession t.commit codepre  pThis code works in several environments, but fails in the most important one due to a reported deadlock. This happens when there isnt even a second concurrent request to the method  the second session gets created, checks the version and then gets ignored while the first session performs the commit transaction. I suspect that this issue is either environmental but I dont see why this would be the case, or that hibernate doesnt like the use of the second session but this is just an educated guess. Im particularly confused as to why hibernate would report this as a deadlock since theres only a single transaction.p  pAny ideas on this are much appreciatedp

Negative 5482 pI know this question is to some degree a matter of taste. I admit this is not something I dont understand, its just something I want to hear others opinion about.p  pI need to write a method that takes two arguments, a boolean and a string.

Negative 5482 pI tried googling this with no luck, so Im trying here. p  pI have a couple of classes, each of which defines a member codestruct foocode.

Negative 5482 pemEDITemp  pSome people have suggested calling submit directly on the form.  This is not what I am trying to achieve.  I want, specifically, to be able to call the click event on an input typesubmit and have it submit the form like it normally would.  jQuery UI Dialog appears to be interfering with this normal behavior.  Please check out the jsFiddle link I have created, as the problem is recreatable on there.p  hr  p First off I have already seen this question on StackOverflow, but the answer does not work in my situation  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions757232jqueryuidialogwithaspnetbuttonpostbackjQuery UI Dialog with ASP.NET button postbacka p  pstrongDesired Behaviorstrongp  pOn my page I have both a hidden field and a submit button which is hidden via CSS.  p  pWhat I want to do is use JavaScript to programmatically click this button, thereby causing the form to be submitted.  Most importantly.... I want to trigger all of this from inside of a jQuery UI Dialog.  Basically, the user will be making a selection inside the jQuery UI dialog that will cause the whole page to be submitted and reload.  p  pstrongProblem Statementstrongp  pTriggering a button click like this normally works fine to submit the form.  However, it fails when the action is triggered from within a jQuery UI Dialog.p  pemAs you can see in my jsFiddle codeem,  I call jQuerys click function on the submit button.... but the form does not actually submit  The button is indeed getting clicked by the JavaScript, but the form submit behavior does not occur itself.  The page is not posted.p  pI believe the jQuery UI Dialog is somehow interfering with the form submit behavior of the button I am trying to programmatically click.p  pstrongThe reason I want to programmatically trigger the button clickstrongp  pI cannot have the buttons located eminsideem the dialog be submit buttons themselves.  In my case, I have created a reusable JavaScript control that wraps a jQuery UI Dialog.  This JS control allows the users to pick an employee.  However, when an employee is picked, the desired behavior is emnot always going to beem  form submit.  Sometimes I might want to display the picked employee on the page and not perform a submit yet.p  pstrongAdditional detailsstrongp  pThis problem is not specific to ASP.NET, but here are some additional details to help explain why I am attempting all this.  I am writing an ASP.NET Web Forms app using .NET 4.5.  I have begun to use JavaScript more and more for my pages, but on this particular page I want to trigger an actual postback to the server so I can handle a button click event from the ASP.NET page life cycle and populate a GridView.  That is why I want to be able to use JavaScript to click an aspbutton that, in turn, causes a form submit.p  pstrongAnd most importantly... Try it Yourself  See jsFiddle link below.....strongp  pAgain, this issue it not specific to ASP.NET.  I have been able to recreate the same issue here on JsFiddle using regular HTML and jQuery UI.  Here is the JsFiddle link  p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netfENyZ18httpjsfiddle.netfENyZ18ap  pAs you can see in the code, I already attempted to use the fix of moving the jQuery UI Dialog inside the form via jQuery DOM manipulation.  This does not appear to fix the issue.p  pThanks  I appreciate any helpp  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgtltheadgt ltbodygt      ltform actionhttpwww.google.comindex.html methodpostgt          ltinput typebutton valueOpen jQuery dialog idbtnOpenDialog gt         ltbr gtltbr gtltbr gt          The button below submits the form correctly if you click it.ltbr gt         However, when I try to trigger click event on this button ltugtfrom within the jQuery UI Dialog aboveltugt then the form ltbgtfails to be submitted.         ltbgtltbr gt          ltinput typesubmit valueSubmit Form idbtnSubmitForm gt           ltinput typehidden idhdnEmployeeChosen value gt                 ltformgt           ltdiv iddivPopup classdialogClass styledisplay nonegt         Picking an employee below ltbgtought toltbgt cause the form to submit, but sadly it does not...         ltbr gtltbr gt          ltdiv classdivOptionsgt             ltinput typebutton valuePick classpickButton employeeNameWeird Al gt             Weird Al Yankovic         ltdivgt         ltdiv classdivOptionsgt                         ltinput typebutton valuePick classpickButton employeeNameDracula gt             Count Dracula         ltdivgt         ltdiv classdivOptionsgt                       ltinput typebutton valuePick classpickButton employeeNameDavid gt             David Copperfield         ltdivgt             ltdivgt  ltbodygt codepre  pstrongJavaScriptstrongp  precodedocument.readyfunction       var jqueryDialog  divPopup                 .dialog                     autoOpen false,                     modal true,                     title My Dialog,                     width 300,                     height 300,                     draggable false,                     resizable false                        This fix does not appear to help matters..........     jqueryDialog.parent.appendToformfirst      btnOpenDialog.clickfunction           jqueryDialog.dialogopen                   .pickButton.clickfunction             Put picked value into hidden field         var pickedEmployee  this.attremployeeName         hdnEmployeeChosen.valpickedEmployee           Try to cause a submit ASP.NET postback in my case                  THIS PART DOES NOT WORK.................         btnSubmitForm.click          alerthdnEmployeeChosen.val            codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodeform  margin 5px     border 1px solid black     backgroundcolor EEE     padding 15px 5px   .dialogClass   border 1px solid black padding 5px margin 5px     backgroundcolor LightBlue     fontsize 14px   .pickButton    marginright 5px      .divOptions     marginbottom 3px     codepre

Negative 5482 pFirst, I apologize if this is a dumb question, but Im new to MVC and am trying to get up to speed as quickly as possible. I have spent hours searching for answers and even went and bought a book on MVC 4, but it still didnt answer my question. p  pI have a form Id like a user to fill out to add a new product to the catalog. They choose the category, enter the name, a description, etc.. On the same page Id like them to be able to add sizes or product options such as Small, Medium, Large, etc.. The problem is Im not sure how to go about this. p  pI need to temporarily store the size options for example in some sort of collection until the user actually saves the product, then I need to be able to read the collection. What Im trying to avoid is to have the user add the basic product info, then save it, then select it, then choose to add options to it. Im trying to just do it all on one form.  Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 5482 pSo accurate timing is important to me, and I was investigating the 3 types of clocks specified in C 11, namely codesystemclockcode, codesteadyclockcode, and codehighresolutionclockcode.

They all have the same period 1 micro sec, and the timecall is practically the same. strongWhats the point of specifying 3 types of clocks if they are all the samestrong Is this just because the G implementation of codechronocode isnt mature yet Or maybe the 3.1.10 kernel only has one useraccessible clockp  pThe second surprise, and this is huge, is that strongsteadyclockissteady  falsestrong.

Negative 5482 pIve been trying to research why certain compatibility features differ based on operating system so I can program a patch. Im using the compatibility settings in the registry for Windows 95 to run a game that of which the game was produced on in each system. In Windows XP, the game runs perfectly. None of the scenes lag, and the sound works just as well as the scenes. Im unsure of how it runs in Windows Vista, but in Windows 7 amp 8 the compatibility feature breaks the game. I used a VM to run XP, but that doesnt effect the games playability real XP users have tested it. Whenever I play the game using the Win95 setting for compatibility in 7 amp 8, everything lags. The music doesnt slow down during gameplay, but the graphics do. During cutscenes, they literally break. Everything pixelates, white noise and static increases volume, and the video lags every two seconds. p  pI therein tested it in Ubuntu Linux via WINE, and it runs better than it does in XP. I just had to use the alsa sound driver. What changed If so, is it programmatically fixable Im using an amalgamation of C, Batch and Java.  If it is necessary, the video game is entitled The Neverhood.  Thanks.p

Negative 5482 pIn my game the player uses a codeRectanglecode for his bounding box, he can do this because I only need to rotate the player image and not the acctual rectangle but for a eletric beam that one of the bosses have I need to use a codeShapecode because I need to rotate the acctual bounding box and not only the image. The problem is that because I have one codeRectanglecode and one codeShapecode I cant use coderectangle.intersectshapecode nor coderectangle.intersectRectangleshapecode so how would I be able to check the collision between the rectangle and the shape or is there a way that I can rotate a rectangle on instead of a shape I use the codecreateTransformedShapecode instance of an codeAffineTransformcode to rotate the shape p

But that will be double post and make the transfer data double which I think might not be a good practise. p  pSo I want to post it to my server first and let server do the rest.

Negative 5482 pIm working on an iOS game where players villages are displayed on a large kingdom map. Each village has a x,y location on that map, and each village is stored as an object in a database on a server Parse.com.p  pWhat I want to be able to do is pull down all the villages around the current players village. Usually this would be straightforward as you would just use the shortest distance algorithm, but to use that I would need to download all of the villages in the database, and then run the algorithm on each one, then sort them according to distance from player, which is not exactly a quickefficient way of doing it. So does anyone know of a more refinedefficient way of doing the above what would be great would be to be able to pull down the villages around the current player actually in the query to the database, kill 2 birds with one stone so to speak, but I cant see any way to do that. I suspect the answer lies in perhaps storing more information about the location of the village in the database, so a query could pull the closest ones down without having to run an algorithm to make it happen.p  pAny ideasp  pIll leave this question up as Im still interested in how to do it with basic math, the Manhatten distance approach should be ok, but for anyone using Parse.com it might be possible to use geoPoints maybe Its a nutty idea, but Im going to try it.p

Negative 5482 pSo going back to the beginning of this issue. I have using System.Windows.Forms to create a text editor. The textbox control by default accepts an event when its contained text is doubleclicked and highlights the entire row of text.  I wanted to override this behavior with something different. It turns out this requires that I intercept the windows message that kicks off this event and prevent it from ever getting triggered.  Here is a link I found on Stackoverflow that explains almost verbatim what I am doing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2854687isitpossibletodisabletextboxfromselectingpartoftextthroughdoublecliIs it possible to disable textbox from selecting part of text through doubleclickap  pBut this explanation is incomplete Notice that DoubleClickEvent inherits from EventArgs.  It should be inheriting from MouseEventArgs. This is because PreviewDoubleClick is going to need information from the windows message about where the screen was clicked. So thats the task I set off to accomplish override the doubleclick event but still send it all of the click information from the windows message.p  pIf I set up breakpoints in the code, I begin to see where my information is stored.  Message m contains a couple properties, one of which is called LParam.  As I understand, this is a pointer to the click information I want to retrieve.  But this isnt C... I cannot just dereference the pointer. .NET conveniently provides the Message.GetLParam method to help me out. I am having trouble getting this method to work.p  pHere is my codep  precode    public class DoubleClickEventArgs  MouseEventArgs      public DoubleClickEventArgsMouseButtons Button, int clicks, int x, int y, int delta  base Button, clicks, x, y, delta         public bool Handled              get         set        public class NewTextBox  System.Windows.Forms.TextBox      public event EventHandlerltDoubleClickEventArgsgt NewDoubleClick     private const int WMDBLCLICK  0xA3     private const int WMLBUTTONDBLCLK  0x203      protected override void WndProcref Message m              if m.Msg  WMDBLCLICK  m.Msg  WMLBUTTONDBLCLK                      DoubleClickEventArgs e  DoubleClickEventArgs m.GetLParamtypeofMouseEventArgs              if NewDoubleClick  null                              NewDoubleClickthis, e                           if e.Handled                              return                                base.WndProcref m       codepre  pAs you can see it, looks a lot like the sample.  The crazy casting I did to get it to compile on this line DoubleClickEventArgs e  DoubleClickEventArgs m.GetLParamtypeofMouseEventArgs is obviously causing the crash. We get the error No parameterless constructor defined for this object.p  pThat makes sense. DoubleCLickEventArgs do require parameters to be created. But the parameters are defined by the lParam pointer... Can anyone give me a little guidance here  Im struggling.p

So i have managed images as per dpdensity independent pixels. I have put images in drawable xhdpi,hdpi,mdpi and ldpi. it works well for most of devices but for different devices ppi pixels may varies from device to device so dpdensity independent pixels is not fixed so my all calculations according to dpdensity independent pixels goes wrong and cannot be set properly. gt             ltRelativeLayoutgt              ltView

Negative 5482 pI have two forms that I am using. One for signup, using devise for authentication, and the second is for adding user comments.

It, however, is showing up as nil. Im very new to rails and Im not sure if this is a problem similar to the first form or if it something completely different. p  pAll the other solutions Ive found online seem to point to attraccessible, but I think Im good there. So it must be something else. Where else should I look to troubleshoot this Has anybody else experienced thisp  pEDITp  pThe second form is for user comments. It looks like thisp  precodelt simpleformforstatus, html classformhorizontal do f gt     lt f.input userid gt     lt f.input content gt      ltdiv classformactionsgt       lt f.button submit gt     ltdivgt lt end gt codepre  pThe content is being saved, but the userid is nil.

I added gem protectedattributes to my Gemfile so that I could use this, since I didnt know what the convention was for Rails 4. Would I be better off getting rid of this If so, is there something I should be doing instead of this to protect certain inputsp
Negative 5482 pI have searched around for the answer to this and have come across IGNORE and WHERE NOT EXISTS however they both seem to do slightly differently than what I am trying to accomplish.

My issue seems to be that I need to compare the name, realm and region of the character before deciding if it is a duplicate as the same name can appear on different regionrealm combinations.p  pI have tried comparing all of the values of the 3 nonauto incrementing columns as followsp  pREPLACE INTO characters codecharacternamecode, codecharacterregioncode, codecharacterrealmcode VALUES Peter,AMERICA,Realm1 WHERE NOT EXISTSSELECT  FROM characters WHERE codecharacternamecodePeter AND codecharacterregioncodeAMERICA AND codecharacterrealmcodeRealm1p  pThis however returns a MYSQL error as the syntax is incorrect. I have also tried INSERT IGNORE INTO... however that only seems to be checking the id value. I dont believe I need to check the id at all as I have it set to auto increment.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, I am using PHP for the other parts of this if it helps. Thanks again.p
Negative 5482 pI would like to write a small mathematical library for matrices. The key variable of the class is obviously the field of entries.

Negative 5482 pIm working on an application that should be available to intranet users running under their own account Windows authentication. This is easily configured and works.p  pNow if users are not logged in to the domain because they are off site or on a device that is not logged in they should still be able to use the application, minus some personalized functionality.p  pSo to sum that up, this is what I would like to happenp  ol liUser opens the application. If windows credentials are available the browser sents them to IIS.li liIf the users credentials are recieved, the application runs under these credentials Ive got that covered.li liIf the users credentials are not recieved, the application runs under the IIS anonymous account and personalized functionality is turned off Ive got that covered as well.li ol  pWhat I cant get to work is to optionally send the credentials. If I turn on windows authentication, Ill be logged in, which is fine. However if I try to access the site without sending credentials Ill get a 401, which makes sense. So I turn on anonymous authentication and now credentials are never sent.p  pThis actually makes sense, because IIS never requests for authentication from the browser. The question is, how do I make this scenario workp
Negative 5482 pfirst question on my part. Hope to be precise. I have the following scenariop  pI render a page displaying data to be printed. The user has two options represented by buttons Print 1 and Print 2 they are named differently, but that does not matter. I will only explain 1 kind of print because the other one works basically the same, just shows some extra columns via classes and a separate print stylesheet.p  pSo when the user clicks on a print button, the following shall happenp  ol lipA JavaScript function will be called checking via JQuery AJAX if the conditions for printing are met. This works fine, the success function is called, data are loaded etc.pli lipDepending on the conditions being met, one of two callback functions to the function shall be executed. If conditions are not met, only an alert is displayed, but if they are, the callback function shall initiate two print jobs One in landscape, one portrait. I have already read that there is no browsercompliant way to force the layout there , so there is no other choice than asking the user to make the appropriate settings. pli ol  pNow, here comes my problem Only the emlastem of the two print jobs is executed. The first one is not processed. I suspect Chrome somehow overrides them or something. But whatever I do, as soon as the second print job comes to action via window.print, only that one happens. The weird thing is, that I got it working when it did not implement it via callbacks. This is some pseudo code that is happeningp  precodefunction checkConditionsyesCallback, noCallback      .ajaxurl, data, success functiondata, textStatus          if conditionsMet              yesCallback          else              noCallback                      codepre  pHere the code when the button is clickedp  precodebutton.clickfunction      event.preventDefault      checkConditions         function              alertPrint this in landscape mode             window.print             .ajaxsuccess functiondata, textStatus                  append new data, arrange them etc.                           and print again             alertNow print in portrait mode, please             window.print         ,          function              alertCannot print. Conditions not met.           codepre  pThe callbacks work fine, they are called and processed, both print statements are passed.  But basically what happens is firstAlert  secondAlert  print. Very frustrating. Even more frustrating is that it works in IE even though it opens 2 dialogs which can be confusing.p  pDoes anyone know how to work around that in Chrome Or how to fix it properly Printing is a field that I have very little experience with and I am annoyed that there is no possibility to compliantly change layout, as it is a report application where the print layout should be forced.p

Negative 5482 pIm trying to build a string from f, being split at whitespace and read it into a struct. f is the char array Im iterating over.p  pI then copy the contents from tmp into ra1.callsign, and essentially empty the tmp char array.p  pWhat I want to do is have the the tmp variable start building from index 0 again, so that when I try to strcpy the second time round all the characters in tmp start from index 0.

Negative 5482 pIn our app we are currently saving binary data to the database terrible, I know but this is legacy stuff and it wasnt my decision. Were trying to migrate this data out to an external device and Im trying to come up with a scheme to save these files.p  pWe have multiple tenants, Id like to have a directory per tenant. My scheme for that is to build path using the firstthree letters of the tenant. So if you had a tenant called codeapplecode, its files would be at codeappapplecode. Within these directories, I will save the files. For the files, I want to generate a random 6character alphanumeric name only lowercase characters for the time being because internal reasons. So if we generate a file name called code6a8jxocode, it will stored as codelttenantgt6a66a8jxocode. With this strategy, each tenant can have a maximum of approximately 916 billion unique files not that were attempting to save that many, with a maximum of 46,656 files per directory. If I go for a 5character name, we will have a maximum of 60.5 billion unique files with 1,296 files per directory.p  pAre there any drawbacks to this approach I realize that certain directories may only contain one or two files, but in my mind that is not a huge problem.p  pMy colleague doesnt want to do it this way he wants to use an autoincremented field in the database and then base the directory structure on the hexvalue I assume 32bit of that instead of using the tenant. With his strategy the hex value would be used as follows the file will be stored in the directory located at codelttenantgtaabbbcode where codeaacode is the first two characters most significant nibbles of the hex value, and codebbbcode is the next three. His reasoning is that he only wants to create new directories when one fills up instead of having numerous, partiallyfilled directories. p  pThis approach introduces numerous difficulties on the code side of things and I dont see having completelyfilled directories as an argument that justifies the extra effort required to do this.p  pAre there any other strategies or approaches I havent consideredp
Negative 5482 pWe have an app with a reporting module. p  pWhen user requests a report, we are using SignalR to report the progress of the report back to the user. We do this by reporting messages to the Caller. The messages are progress snippets to indicate activity, such as Loading data... Compiling... Decrypting... etc. Then a formatted excel spreadsheet is sent down the wire and the user downloads.p  pThe problem I am having is that we deploy this to production, and for an indeterminate period it is working great, then for some unknown reason to me it stops working. SignalRHubs disappears and turns into a 404 error.p  pThe app is a hybrid asp.net and classic asp app, and is hosted on IIS6.p  pWe are using SignalR version v1.1.3 recently upgraded from 0.5 to see if this fixed the issue, but it is still present. We cant upgrade to 2.x because the webserver Windows 2003 is not supported for dotnet 4.5 and thats what the new Owin needs I think.p  pThe only way I can get it working again is to recycle the app pool, but this is highly problematic as the app uses the session, so this logs everyone out, meaning if the reports go down, we either have to kick everyone off or wait until a maintenance window to restart the app pool.p  pI have tried nearly everything I can find online to remedy. Our Request Queue Limit was raised to 20000, we are using the right script tags and references etc. I cant turn on debugging because the hub cannot be found at all after a while. Extremely frustrating bug because we cannot replicate or pinpoint any problems.p  pSo the question is has anyone experienced this, or how can I track down the cause of this issue Also is there a better support channel for SignalRp  pAny help at all will be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 5482 pAs per the subject line, is there a standard Python 2.7 library call that I can use like thisp  precodereturncode, stdout, stderr  invokesubprocessargs, stdin codepre  pThe catch is that I want all three forms of output  the returncode and the entire and separate content from both stdout and stderr.  I expected to find something like this in the subprocess module, but the closest I can see is codesubprocess.checkoutputcode, which gives you two out of three the returncode and stdout.p  pThere are other questions on stack overflow that suggest piping stderr to stdout, but I need to keep them separate because Im using Python to drive testing of some nonPython applications where Im trying to distinguish which output shows up on which streams.  For example, I want to verify that humanreadable error messages shows up in stderr, but that only machineparseable output data shows up on stdout.p  pI think what I want is a simple fourliner...p  precodedef methodargs, input     from subprocess import Popen, PIPE     p  Popenargs, stdinPIPE, stdoutPIPE, stderrPIPE     out, err  p.communicateinput     return p.poll, out, err codepre  p...so Im a bit surprised that theres not already be a method like this, given the number of other methods that are emmostlyem similar to this in the codesubprocesscode module.  Does it exist and Im missing it, or is it present somewhere in some other standard Python 2.7 module  Or is there a subtle reason why a method like this is a bad ideap

Negative 5482 pi m working on a web app, which potentially has unknown number of image uploads. The structure is something like businesproductsimages. One business can have lots of products, and each product can have 3 to 50 images. The system is open to everyone to register and create business, so when there are 10k businesses with 10 products per business, and 10 images per product, there will be 1 million images uploaded to the server.p  pMy question is how should these images to be stored on the server. I know theres a limit in Linux, what i normally did is to split the filename or a specific string in certain pattern to spread the files into a hierarchical structure hence each folder contains small amount of files. The good side about this is it solves the file limit issue and fast to retrieve a file on the other hand this method could use too many iNodes while the file amount increases.p  pCan anyone help me with this, how does a web server stores large number of uploaded files I m not sure if the application will be deployed on a Linux server or a Windows one, please let me know how you dop  pAny help is sincerely appreciatedp

Negative 5482 pWe have an apache web server version httpd2.2.22win32x86openssl0.9.8t with weblogic version 10.3.2 cluster having 3 nodes. In our load testing, we get session timeout errors in some cases less than 1. This was happening, even if we have 1 for session timeout in the web.xmls of weblogic nodes. After days of debugging, we realized that in some cases, the JSESSIOID sent by request is not honored by the response. Fiddler traces show that the RESPONSE has a header named SetCookieJSESSIONID and the value for this is different from the JSESSIONID sent in the request. We get the session expiry page immediately. As already mentioned, this happens only in some rare cases.p

Negative 5482 pI am new to Windows MDM server and still learning it, so my question can be a little naive so please bear with it p  pI trying to develop windows MDM server. I have gone through Windows MDM protocol document, SyncML document and MOF files. But I am yet not sure about the syntax for Commands like ADD, Replace. How the data will be sent to device in  ...  in SyncML for various MOF classes. p  pIt was very clear in one of the example provided in doc for sending certificate. But have not given clear examples for sending data such as wifi profile as a data. Will it be key val pair of just comma seperated list in  p  pIf anyone has already working mdm server and would like to share sample SyncML formated command will be very helpful in my case.p
Negative 5482 pOn the stack the compiler is free to do a lot of optimizations, because the context is static and known at compile time, but when dealing with access to dynamically allocated objects and generally accessing by reference the context is not known, so logically in such cases, member access boils down to dereferencing a memory address derived by adding the object base address and the offset for that member. strongOr does itstrong I am pretty new to this, so at this point I am only guessing and probably missing a lot of details.p  pFor example I noticed that if I implement the codecode operator as codevoid addint  a, int  b, int  rcode when working with stack members and using the codeampcode operator the assembly code is identical to that the regular codecode operator creates, so it does seem that pointers which are known to point to compile time known values are are being optimized to exclude extra dereferencing and copying and the indirections inside the codeaddcode function are inlined as direct access to stack objects. strongDoes this mean the compiler is good enough to be able to optimize say accessors implemented with indirection from constant value offsets from the object base address on the stack as if using struct member access to get that valuestrongp

The final application will perform lots of row level look ups and readings, with a very small percentile of db write backs.p  pWith the above scenario in mind, its being suggested that I should look at a NoSQL option in order to scale to the large load of data and transactions, and after a bit of research the roads leads to Neo4j while considering MongoDB as a second alternativep  pI would appreciate your guidance with the following set of initial questionsp  pDoes Neo4j support the concept of store procs and does it supports conditional statements if then, else, loops, etcp  pWould I be able to install and run the 50TB db on a single node single Windows Serverp  pDoes Neo4j supportleverage multiple CPUs in single server ex 4 CPUsp  pWould open source version be able to support the 50TB db or would I need to purchase the ENT versionp  pRegards,  rp

Negative 5482 pThe script below demonstrates the unexpected behavior in powershell which baffles me.  The issue is most likely something Im doing wrong, but Im unable to figure it out.  The script looks at specific times of specific days and depending on a set of parameters it takes various actions.  I have a Boolean which alternates on iterations of the included loop.  Or at least it should, therein lies the problem.  Heres an example script which demonstrates how Im using the variables and produces the odd behaviorp  precodeDisabledRequests  false Time  GetDate UFormat R Day  GetDate UFormat u  function checktime    ifTime ge 0700 and Time le 1900 and Day le 5      ifDisabledRequests eq false         WriteHost Time is time, Day is day.  Inside disabledrequests eq false statement.         DisabledRequests  true Sets variable to true         DisabledRequests eq true Prints true on the console because the statement is true     else         else      WriteHost Outside limited time parameters.     ifDisabledRequests eq true             WriteHost Changing disabled requests var to false.             DisabledRequests  false           fori0 i le 10 i checktime  codepre  pThe expected behavior is that the script should loop though the conditional at the present moment the conditional relative to time should result in codetruecode and then another conditional checking the status of the codeDisabledRequestscode variable.  Because the variable is initially codefalsecode the conditional runs correctly on the first iteration.  Part of that conditionals actions is to set the variable codeDisabledRequestscode to codetruecode, which it does.  At least, the part about codeDisabledRequests eq truecode prints True on the console.p  pThe problem is, if the codeDisabledRequestscode variable is now true, why is the conditional codeDisabledRequests eq falsecode still being evaluated as truep  pEDITp  pId like to also add that Ive attempted to clear the variable with codeClearVariablecode and then recreate it with codeSetVariablecode as true, and that doesnt work as expected either.p

Negative 5482 pI am trying to understand why posted values in my Laravel 4 code example persist in a session, even after a browser refresh. I would have thought that if a request is reset by a refresh F5, that the form would be reset back to its original state.p  pWhen I navigate to a hrefhttpdomain.comregister relnofollowhttpdomain.comregistera, the form is shown in its initial state. When I try to submit with errors, the validation errors appear correctly. If I try to refresh F5 the form errors persist. If I navigate away from a hrefhttpdomain.comregister relnofollowhttpdomain.comregistera and the return, the errors still appear as though I just submitted an erroneous form. When I submit a valid form, the user is registered correctly in the database and I get the registrationsuccess session variable that shows that the request was completed. If I try to refresh the browser, the registrationsuccess session variable persists and I cannot make it disappear with browser refresh or navigation away from and back to the page. So if another user tries to register, the session persists and the registration form cannot be rendered until the session expires at the preset 30 minutes. I would have thought that the getroute would have been used on a browser refresh, thereby resetting the form. Can someone please explain to me what is happening here, if this is what Laravel is designed to do and how I can get the form to reset with a refreshp  pHere are my routesp  precodeRoutegetregister, array   uses gt UserControllerregister,   as gt users.register   Routepostregister, array   uses gt UserControllercreate,   as gt users.create  codepre  pHere are my relevant UserController functionsp  precodepublic function register      return Viewmakeusers.register      public function create  input  Inputall rules  array     emailgt emailuniqueusersrequired,     firstnamegtrequired,     lastnamegtrequired,     passwordgtmin6confirmedrequired,     passwordconfirmationgtsamepasswordrequired,  validator  Validatormakeinput,rules     ifvalidatorgtfails         messages  validatorgtmessages         return RedirecttoregistergtwithInputgtwithErrorsvalidator     else         user  Sentryregisterarray             email    gt Inputgetemail,             password gt Inputgetpassword,             firstname gt Inputgetfirstname,             lastname gt Inputgetlastname                  return Redirectbackgtwithregistrationsuccess, Registration Complete       codepre  pHere is the relevant formp  precodeif Sessionhasregistrationsuccess     ltdivgt         lth3gt Sessiongetregistrationsuccess lth3gt     ltdivgt else  if errorsgtany     ltulgt          implode, errorsgtallltli classerrorgtmessageltligt      ltulgt endif  ltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classcolmd6 colmdoffset3gt    Formopenarrayaction gt UserControllercreate   ltdiv classformgroup ltphp iferrorsgthasfirstnameecho haserrorgtgt  Formlabelfirstname, First Name   Formtextfirstname, , arrayplaceholdergtFirst Name, classgterrorsgthasfirstname  formcontrol haserror  formcontrol  ltdivgt  ltdiv classformgroup ltphp iferrorsgthaslastnameecho haserrorgtgt  Formlabellastname, Last Name   Formtextlastname,  , arrayplaceholdergtLast Name, classgterrorsgthaslastname  formcontrol haserror  formcontrol  ltdivgt  ltdiv classformgroup ltphp iferrorsgthasemailecho haserrorgtgt  Formlabelemail, Email   Formtextemail, , arrayplaceholdergtEmail, classgterrorsgthasemail  formcontrol haserror  formcontrol  ltdivgt  ltdiv classformgroup ltphp iferrorsgthaspasswordecho haserrorgtgt  Formlabelpassword, Password   Formpasswordpassword, arrayplaceholdergtPassword, classgterrorsgthaspassword  formcontrol haserror  formcontrol  ltdivgt  ltdiv classformgroup ltphp iferrorsgthaspasswordconfirmationecho haserrorgtgt  Formlabelpassword, Confirm Password   Formpasswordpasswordconfirmation, arrayplaceholdergtPassword again, classgterrorsgthaspasswordconfirmation  formcontrol haserror  formcontrol  ltdivgt  ltdiv classformgroupgt  FormsubmitRegister,arrayclassgtbtn btnsuccess  ltdivgt   Formclose       ltdivgt ltdivgt endif codepre

Also, adding libraries in the code[asinstall]modulescode directory to code[asinstall]domainsMyDomainlibextcode seems to make the Persistence library locateable but leads to further errors trying to locate classes present in libraries in the code[asinstall]modulescode directory.

Negative 5482 pLike in the subject and here is problem synopsis I have some 480 different steel types. Some steels can be converted into another through heat andor chemical processing. Moreover, over years specifications and technologies change and some mutations become impossible and others become available. My production environment needs to be freely and easily able to add or remove individual steel types as they search for them in db.p  pSolution I wanted to use bit masks to deliver the solution. Each steel type would be assigned individual significant bit position. Steel types that can go together would have their bit masks combined creating default group search masks. As use modifies the group at runtime, bit mask of individual steel type would be added or subtracted from default group search mask. When executed, query would perform binary ANDing against individual bit masks of all items in specified table and return all like codesearchMask amp individualMask ltgt 0code I successfully use this principle for other applications but bitwise operators in SQL can not be applied to a pair of binary fields. The largest data type I can use is 64 bit bigint.p  pThus the question, how can I perform binary ANDing on two binary fields in TSQL or what other solution could I use for above problem without creating arbitrary groupsp

Negative 5482 pI was reading all the answers about communication between controllers and directive, but is seems to me occurred using shared service and inject it to each one of them. When Im developing a very large scale application, I dont know what my page is going to have in it. I may have 2 controllers need to communicate between them, and I also may have 5 directive and 2 controllers in the same page. I dont know from scratch what is going to be inside my viewpage, so I need a better way how to communicate between them. Im looking for that better way to do it, the right AngularJS way.p  pa hrefhttpi60.tinypic.com2z87q05.png relnofollowhttpi60.tinypic.com2z87q05.pngap  pstrongAbove is my view example Im working onstrong on the left side I have a directive tree, on the right side I have chart controller and directive grid. I may have more than this, but this is a good example of what I may have. Keep in mind, the view can have X componenets, you dont know from the beginning what will be in it.p  pNow, lets say each time I select node in tree on the left, I want to be able to tell the other controllers that nodeSelectedChange event happend. I dont want to inject each one of them a service that holds that info, so I thought about something like having a Page Manager Controller, which is the father of the all view. All my controllersdirectives inside my page should talk with each other only by the PageManagerController, he is the only thing in page that knows what he has inside of it. p  pstrongImportant here to keep in mindstrong The tree dont know the page has chart or grid, they dont need to know each other in order to communicate. The page manager knows everything, now I want it to make the magic  Should it has a service Should each other component has service and service can talk with PageManager servicep  pHelp me to think. Hope I can connect all the dots to create a BETTER way for communication. I think the sharedService way is good for small app, when you know from start what is going on in your app, but most of the time  You just dont know who and when is going to use your directive, it should be able to talk with everyone.p  pstrongWhat I dont like about eventsstrongp  ol liThe events being fired inside the controller, while it should be inside a service.li liThe listener controller should know the name of the event he is going to listen too.

Negative 5482 pI need to format a single cell with a gradient color based on the values of a range of cells. Similar to the conditional formatting with a ColorScale, except only applying the formatting to a single cell based on the values of a range of cells.p  pMost likely this will need to be done in VBA. I cant seem to find a simple way to do this without rewriting a similar script to the builtin ColorScale methods.p  pExamplep  pB10 formatted with a color in a scale based upon the values of B10B40. ColorScale would be type 3 with Low, Mid 50, and High. But I dont want to format any cells other than B10, just use the values of the range B10B40p  pI will then do the same for B11B41, but only formatting B11, then B12B42, B13B43, etc..p  pAll I need is to figure out how to create a ColorScale based on a range of values but only apply the formatting to one of the cells.p  pEditp  pIf someone knows a way to create a color scale script similar to the conditional formatting one built into Excel, that would also be a good fix. If I can just calculate the scale from the values in the range of cells and apply to the one cell with the color grade, that would be a solution.p

Some content however is forbidden by Apple foul language resulting in updates being rejected.

So my question is what will happen when content in an update is found inappropriate by Apple Will my app be removed from the App Store Will they ban my developer account Will they even find out The app is in Dutch and therefore its quite hard te determine what is permissible by App Store policy and what is not. I had some explicit content accepted in updates, while other seemingly less explicit content got rejected.p

Negative 5482 pIm new to Python  Django coming from a PHP background and had a question. I have the debug toolbar enabled and it appears as if when I reference variables in the template that I built in the view and pass to the template it is result in an SQL query. In other words, the template is making another query to the database instead of using the variable that was built in the view. p  pHere is one example of what I am talking about.

Negative 5482 pAs the title suggests, Im running into the cryptic error,strongERRMAXEARTHPROCESSESstrong, while trying to add points to a google earth instance.

Negative 5482 pI am little bit confused about the codesmX option within the gencode statement.p  pAn example What does the NVCC compiler optionp  precodegencode archcompute13,codesm13 codepre  pembed in the library p  pOnly the machine code cubin code for GPUs with CC 1.3, or strongalsostrong the PTX code for GPUs with CC 1.3 p  pIn the Maxwell compatibility guide, it is stated Only the backend target versionss specified by the code clause will be retained in the resulting binary. p  pFrom that, I would infer that the given compiler option only embeds machine code for GPUs with CC 1.3 and emnoem PTX code. This would mean that it would strongnotstrong be possible to run this library e.g. on aa Maxwell generation card, as there is no PTX code embeded within the library from which the machine code could be justintime JIT compiled.p  pOn the other side, on the GTC 2013 presentation Introduction to the CUDA Toolkit as an Application Build Tool by NVIDIA it is stated that the gencode archcompute13,codesm13 is enough for all GPUs with CC  1.3, and that with this compiler option for GPUs with CC  1.3 the machine code is JITed from the PTX code. So, the information given in the Maxwell compatibility guide and this GTC presentation is conflicting in my opinion.p

Negative 5482 pThis problem has been driving me absolutely crazy. I have a ListPicker that is populated dynamically with several items. I have placed declared my SelectionChanged event handler in the Loaded event of my page. When the user clicks a certain item on the page, the ListPicker visibility will toggle from Collpased to Visible, and I set the values of the ListPicker. The issue is, the index of the ListPicker will be based upon the users settings, so out of three items the current index may be 1, not 0 as is the default. I need to show 1 as the current item in the ListPicker without the SelectionChanged event firing which performs operations based on the current index. Then and only then when the user changes the selected item himself or herself do I need the SelectionChanged event to fire.p  pThe main reason for this is not only does the user need to see his or her current setting in the ListPicker when it is displayed, but on the SelectionChanged event operations occur which overwrite what currently exists which is extremely confusing and not supposed to occur unless the user specifies.p  pWhat I currently have is as followsp  pXAMLp  precodelttoolkitListPicker xNamelp VisibilityCollapsed Margin12 Width300gt codepre  pXAML.CSp  precodeprivate void PageLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              lp.SelectionChanged  lpSelectionChanged       void EditableEllipseTapobject sender, System.Windows.Input.GestureEventArgs e      if sender  null              DependencyObject tappedElement  e.OriginalSource as UIElement          find parent UI element of type PhotoThumbnail         PhotoThumbnail i  this.FindParentOfTypeltPhotoThumbnailgttappedElement         i  this.FindParentOfTypeltPhotoThumbnailgttappedElement         if i  null                      BuildControli                 private void BuildControlPhotoThumbnail pp              switchpp.NName                      case flip                 ListltListPickerItemgt l  new ListltListPickerItemgt                                     l.Addnew ListPickerItem  Name  FlipVertical, Content  AppResources.AppFlipVertical                  l.Addnew ListPickerItem  Name  FlipHorizontal, Content  AppResources.AppFlipHorizontal                  l.Addnew ListPickerItem  Name  FlipBoth, Content  AppResources.AppFlipBoth                  lp.ItemsSource  l  Code execution jumps from here to ValueChanged event immediately                                   lp.Visibility  Visibility.Visible                 lp.SelectedIndex  Settings.Flip.Value  1                 break         ..                private async void lpSelectionChangedobject sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e                  if lp.SelectedIndex  1 always defaults to  0                              var item  sender as ListPicker.SelectedItem                 string name  ListPickerItemitem.Name                  if name  null                                          switch name                                                      case FlipVertical                                 Settings.Flip.Value  1                                 ..perform process based on current Setting.Flip.Value..                                    break                             case FlipHorizontal                                 Settings.Flip.Value  2                                 ..perform process based on current Setting.Flip.Value..                                 break                             case FlipBoth                                 Settings.Flip.Value  3                                 ..perform process based on current Setting.Flip.Value..                                 break                               ...                                                          codepre

Negative 5482 pIm trying to make exceptions working inside our native library in Android connected by JNI to the main Java program.br The problem is if I enable exceptions which is easy since ndkr5, I lose ability to deduce crash reason from backtrace. I.e. when using exceptions, crash backtrace contains only 2 lines which is not enough to understand the context.p  pIve searched a lot but it looks like either nobody encountered this problem, or just didnt consider broken backtrace a problem.br Hoped theyll fix it in new versions, but its the same since ndkr5c up to r10b, and Android from 2.3 up to 4.4. Tried gcc and clang.  p  pThough maybe its something related to our flags or sources or something else.br But it easily reproduces on simplest casebr 1. Take original NDK sample, bitmapplasmabr 2. in JNI, rename plasma.c to plasma.cpp so, Its now Cbr 3. Add APPCPPFLAGS  fexceptionsbr 4. Add APPSTL  gnustlstatic this step isnt really necessarybr 5. In sources, place some code that deliberately crashesbr 6. Compile recently tried gcc 4.6, ndkr9 and ndkr10b and run  p  pAt this point, still have nicelooking backtrace in logs 10something items. But ifbr 7. Place try block in some place not even around the crash pointp  pAfter this, backtrace only has 2 lines. Please note, I didnt even tried to throwp  pMy question is anybody was able to get both things exceptions and decent crash backtrace working in the same buildp  pDetails I add 2 functionsp  precodeextern void crash     int a     static volatile int crash  0     crash  5   extern void nocrash  codepre  pAnd then, inside of fillplasma functionp  precodecrash      try         nocrash     catchconst stdexceptionamp e codepre  pSo, with this code, backtrace is OK. Uncomment try  2 lines of backtrace.p  pIve tried to analyse the disassembly for possible idea whats different, but the compiler only adds the code at the end of the function, which is never called in this case no throw.p  pWhy I need the exceptions theres tons of errorchecking code we want to get rid of. This code is in macros which behaves differently on platforms with good exceptions support so that C users of library could write strongtheirstrong code without errorchecking after almost every line.p  pWhy I need standard backtrace in tombstones our code is part of much bigger solution. Its tested on other site on the whole. If they got the crash, they collect all standard logs and some description of what they did before crash.br In worst case, no reproduction. No way to use gdb.br I though about using some thirdparty library for getting backtrace like google breakhpad, but Ill have to set signal handler not sure it will go well with other parts of system, and they e.g. breakpad dumps binary info to additional location not sure we could force these remote testers to collect this file.  p  pAny idea to e.g. try some different compiler flags, or maybe Im terribly wrong with somethingp

Negative 5482 pSuppose there is a window with has a codeNSTextViewcode which contains enough text to trigger the scrollbars. When I resize the window, the textview is automatically scrolled so that the line which contains the cursor appears in the middle of the textview.p  pFor example, this can also be seen in TextEdit in MacOS paste bunch of text in it, scroll almost to the top [1], place cursor into the first visible line and resize the window. Now the view should scroll its content so that the cursor lands in the middle of the view.p  pMy question is, how do I turn off this behavior That is, I would like the textview to never automatically scroll the cursor to the middle when the window gets resized..p  p[1] The actual scroll position at which the said behavior happens may require some trialanderror, as I was unable to find out a pattern at which this happens. In my testing it happened when the scrollbar is at 10  30 position of the total height from the top.p

Now the IDP realize this user is already authenticated hence it would issue  a SAML Assertion without prompting any authentication challenge. p  pstrongHow will the IDP realize that user is already authenticated strong p  pAs per my understanding it must be done based on session. Does it mean when authentication request goes from service provider 1 to  Identity server SP1 redirects the request to IS thru browser , IS will first authenticate the credentials and if successful keep the user object under session. p  pNow when second authentication request goes to IS thru SP2, same session ID is sent provided request is sent from another of same browser, IS fins already a user object associated with this session, so trust him. Is this understanding correctp  p2In step 2 it is said that  Now the SP1 can validate the SAML Assertion issued by IDP and let the user login.  what is the specific fieldvalue under SAML response sent by IP , SP1 will verifyp  p3 Where user credentials are stored.

Negative 5482 pSo I am a relatively new to programming and I am trying to make 2D game using LWJGL.  I have made a background map using tiles in an array list, I then update the necessary things such as the player etc, then I draw them onto the screen, and update the screen. I have seen other people do this just fine but whenever I do it uses up almost 100 mb of RAM every second, causing my computer to freeze if the game runs for 30 seconds or less.  I am not sure if its the drawing that is causing this memory usage or something else, I have checked to make sure no code is being ran without my knowledge of it, please if someone should tell me what is wrong that would be great.  I have provided the main classes used in my game, there about 10 total but I have only shown 3 as I think it is enough to get my point. I know some of the code could look much better but, like I said, I am new to all of this.

Negative 5482 pI was reading the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2extendingembedding.html relnofollowembedding guidea, which tells you how to embed static python methods and compilerun them in a c program. I got some static code to run but what Im wondering, is that since its possibly to embed a dynamic language in C, can you just force whatever is running in the process to pause and embed the whole python interpreterp  pThe goal here would be to run any methods that have already been defined in the C program from the python interpreter. Its not clear to me if its possible to embed the interpreter so to make this happen. Is there a specific version to make this workp  pThe closest thing the guide talks about is a runtime argument being passed, where Im looking for a way to suspend operations in the middle of execution until I enter a python statement.p

Can any one explain it p  pJust wanted to add here that ARMv7 doesnt have thread and handler concept so i am not clear requirement in ARMv8.p  pThanksp

Negative 5482 pnew to Unity, and I was trying to import image to scene. I cut out the interesting part and put it on top of transparent background. I was wondering why do we have to expand its edge Didnt it make the sprite extremely ugly Also I assume after creating the alpha channel on the original sprite not the expanded one, you will need to delete the expanded layer to keep the edge sharp p  pI know you guys might not know what I am talking about. Could anybody post some documentation regarding this expanding edge, creating alpha channel etc I read the manual and the Learn Unity for 2D Game Development but still do not have a clue. Thanks.p

Negative 5482 pWe have a codecompmastercode table that is being dropped and rebuilt at the top of every hour. We have a series of reports that pull data from this table, and as our bills of materials get longer, it takes longer and longer to rebuild this table, meaning we cant run our reports for a few minutes at the top of every hour.p  pUp until now this hasnt really been an issue, except I am now developing a report for Sales that will pull information from this table and I cant have the Sales staff being put on hold for a few minutes at the top of every hour.p  pCould I create two tables, one codecompmasterAcode and the other codecompmasterBcode, then have my rebuild SP first rebuild A, then B, then in my query SP I perform a check codeIF compmasterA DOES NOT EXIST USE compmasterBcode The idea is that if A is first dropped and rebuild and then B, one would always contain Data.p  pOr could I create a second table called codecompmasterReportcode, and at the end of my rebuild SP, I call another SP that compares codecompmastercode to codecompmasterReportcode and merges any changes to the codecompmasterReportcode table, and I then use the codecompmasterReportcode table in my reports.p  pIm hoping for a simple solution if at all possible, any ideas or advice is very welcome.p
Negative 5482 pI wrote a script thats running from ebay listing iframe.

Specifically, if a user searches ebay for a product, and clicks on my product from the results, the function extracts the keywords he entered.p  pNow, the problem is, that function is not running on page load at all.

Negative 5482 pI am writing some Python unit tests using the unittest framework and run them in PyCharm. Some of the tests compare a long generated string to a reference value read from a file.

Negative 5482 pI have a static table for settings where I want to pull some stuff from an entity in Core Data. The use case does not lend itself to a table of records as you usually see.  Rather each row of the static table is really a field related to the useras in a user profile. I have a feeling that in testing I may have created more than one record in the entity.  I know there are programs that let you see the SQL lite database underneath, but my question assumes you do not have this tool and are relying just on Xcode. p  pMy question is when you have more than one record in a Core Data entitytable, and you try to load data from the managed object context into a VC, one field into one element, what record is shown by default p  pRelated to this, if you dont know how many managed object or rows are in the database, is there anyway to specify which record you want since there are no auto ids as you would use in a traditional databasep

Negative 5482 pI have a node.jsbased location service that produces events as users move about, and I want to use RxJS to process these events and look for arbitrarily complex patterns like a user enters a region and visits 2 points of interest within 1 hour.p  pTo begin with I need to split the stream of events base on unique user ids from event body, but I am not finding any stock RxJS functions that will do this. p  pfilter would require that all uuids be known beforehand which is not desirable. groupBy looks like it would need to process the entire sequence prior to returning the grouped observables, which is not possible.p  pIm thinking that maybe I need to build a custom observable that maintains a map of uuids to observables, and instantiate new observables as required. Each of these observables would then need to undergo identical processing in search of the pattern match, and ultimately trigger some action when a users movements match the pattern. One of the obvious challenges here is I have a dynamically growing map of observables being produced as user enter the system and move about.p  pAny ideas how something like this could be achieved with RxJSp

Negative 5482 pI wrote some code to determine the nth Fibonacci number using the nice blog post given in the accepted answer to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14661633findingoutnthfibonaccinumberforverylargenFinding out nth fibonacci number for very large 39n39a. I am doing this as a way of practising a more difficult recursion problem given on projecteuler but that is not really relevant. The method relies on changing the problem to a small linear algebra problem of the form p  pFn  Tn F1 p  pwhere F1  1 1t and Fn contains the nth and n1th Fibonacci number. The term Tn can then be determined in Olog n time. I implemented this succesfully and it seems to work fine. When I perform the matrix exponentiation I use 10000 so I get the last 4 digits only, which seems to work I checked against some large Fibonacci numbers. However, I wanted to try to get more last digits by increasing the number 10000. This doesnt seem to work however. I no longer get the correct answer. Here is my codep  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt includeltmath.hgt includeltstdlib.hgt  const unsigned long M  10000  unsigned long int  matProdunsigned long int  A, unsigned long int  B   unsigned long int  C   C  malloc4sizeofunsigned long int   C[0]  A[0]B[0]M  A[1]B[2]M  M   C[1]  A[0]B[1]M  A[1]B[3]M  M   C[2]  A[2]B[0]M  A[3]B[2]M  M   C[3]  A[2]B[1]M  A[3]B[3]M  M   return C   unsigned long int  matExpunsigned long int A, unsigned long int n   if n1     return A      if n20     return matExpmatProdA,A,n2      return matProdA,matExpA,n1   unsigned long int findFibunsigned long int n   unsigned long int A[4]  0, 1, 1, 1   unsigned long int  C   C  malloc4sizeofunsigned long int   C  matExpA,n2   return C[2]C[3]   main   unsigned long int n  300   printfldn,findFibn  codepre  pThere are probably several issues there with regards to proper coding conventions and things that can be improved. I thought changing to long int might solve the problem but this does not seem to do the trick. So basically the problem is that increasing M to for instance 1000000 does not give me more digits but instead gives me nonsense. What mistake am I makingp  pP.S. sorry for the poor math formatting, I am used to math.stackexchange.p

I understand a solution to this problem may be to add it. According to chrome the certificate path terminates at a root certificate names Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority  G2. p  pI guess if I add this to my cacerts using keytool it will work. However I expect users of my application to type in various URLs. I dont want to only allow a particular subset of the internet. I also dont want to disable certificate checking. Chrome, IE and firefox all recognise the IFTTT site without a problem.  Why doesnt the standard cacerts file in Java recognise this Can I get Java to use a system cacerts file which includes all these sites This would have to work on Java on Windows, Max and various Linux flavours.p

Negative 5482 pI have a Wordpress 4.3 site that uses Yoast for SEO. I have a custom post type and a shortcode that can be used to generate a list of posts of that type. The shortcode function uses what I believe to be the a hrefhttpscodex.wordpress.orgTheLoop relnofollowrecommended approacha in Wordpress for generating a list of posts of a certain typep  precodequery  new WPQuery...  while querygthaveposts      querygtthepost      Now I can call methods like theID, thepermalink, etc      I can also access details of the post directly, because at      this point it is stored in the global post variable.   wpresetpostdata  To restore original copy of global post variable codepre  pWhen viewing the actual page that contains the shortcode, everything works fine because the global codewpquerycode variable stashes a copy of the global codepostcode variable before the shortcode function gets called, which enables codewpresetpostdatacode to successfully restore the state of the global codepostcode variable.p  pHowever, I recently discovered a problem when emeditingem the page and although I have fixed the issue, I would like to know if my solution is correct practice in the Wordpress world.p  pThe problem was that whenever I edited the page, several fields would get changed without me having actually touched any of the settings. Further investigation revealed that the reason for this was that the HTML for the edit page, specifically the contents of some form fields, stronghad already been alteredstrong by the time they reached my browser. Compounding this problem was the fact that the permalink field, which is highly visible, was not being altered, but a hidden field called codeslugcode strongwasstrong being altered, and so when the page was submitted, Wordpress was updating the permalink with the value of this now corrupted, hidden slug field. My permalink wasnt so perma after allp  pThe only clue I had about what was causing the problem was that the permalink that was being set belonged to another post in fact, one of the posts that comes up when the shortcode function gets executed.p  pAfter a day and a half of debugging, I figured out the precise reason why the form fields were being trashedp  ol lipWhen preparing the edit page for a post, Wordpress calls all the related plugins in case they need to add any additional information or controls to the sidebar.pli lipOne such plugin is Yoast, which reports an SEO Status. In order to calculate this status, Yoast silently renders the post so that it can then analyse the contents of the page, taking into account the focus keywords, etc.pli lipIn order for Yoast to silently render a page, all of the shortcode functions that contribute output to that page must also be executed.pli lipWhen my shortcode function gets executed as part of Yoasts silent page rendering, it does what I beleive to be the right thing by calling codewpresetpostdatacode at the end to restore the contents of the global codepostcode variable.pli ol  pHowever, the problem was that codewpresetpostdatacode was not, in fact, restoring the global codepostcode variable, because the global codewpquerycode variable did not have a copy. I would have expected codewpresetpostdatacode or codeWPQuerygtresetpostdatacode to throw an error at that point, but they dont.p  pSo every form field in the edit page that was generated after Yoast did its work ended up with values from the wrong post, because the global codepostcode variable had been left with the wrong contents.p  pI have resolved the problem by adding the following defensiveunobtrusive code to the top of my shortcode functionp  precodeglobal wpquery  if  wpquerygtpost  null       return   codepre  pThis means my shortcode function will only execute the loop when there is a guarantee that it will be able to restore the global codepostcode variable using codewpresetpostdatacode.p  pShould I stick to this solution or take it one step further and simply save a copy of the global codepostcode variable myself and just ignore codewpresetpostdatacode altogetherp

Negative 5482 pIm implementing PayPal payments in iOS application. I need to transfer money from customer to merchant account so Im using old MPL SDK with adaptive payments. All works. Now I need to verify payment on server side. For this Im using codePaymentDetailscode API method a hrefhttpsdeveloper.paypal.comdocsclassicapiadaptivepaymentsPaymentDetailsAPIOperation relnofollowAPI referencea. But it always returns an errorp  precodeAuthentication failed. API credentials are incorrect. codepre  pIve created an application on a hrefhttpwww.paypalapps.com relnofollowhttpwww.paypalapps.coma and requested API credentials in my PayPal profile. Ive tried it with premier and business accounts. But still no results.p
Negative 5482 pOur application is caching Entity Framework objects, so that our loadbalanced sites can share cached items, instead of server A and B potentially displaying different content using inmemory cache.p  pHowever, after we have done a deployment, we cannot retrieve the object from cache. The following error is thrownp  pThe deserializer cannot load the type to deserialize because type System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.BannerFDE1BA817D206A7F0FED7955D1DAA7B97FEEF3213D26B91515A9AC18E73619EC could not be found in assembly EntityFrameworkDynamicProxiesMyAssembly, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull. Check that the type being serialized has the same contract as the type being deserialized and the same assembly is used.p  pFrom what I gather, we have cached the EFproxied version emof the old DLLem to AppFabric, and now retrieving this object is tripping EF over because it does not understand its type in the context of our new DLLs. Weve done a few migrations between these 2 deployments, so effectively the DB model has changed.p  pHow can I work around this I think Ill have to remove the cached objects from AppFabric and readd them in  but then we may hit the same problem the next release that we push out.p
