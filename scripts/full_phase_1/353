Positive 353 pI had an idea for an asynchronous parallel program for a data science application. Considering a sharedmemory system with one master and 20 slaves. It would have a matrix at the master node the slaves would read the value of the matrix, do some operations using random numbers and the return value would modify some elements of the matrix asynchronously, allowing for overwrites i.e. the slave who came 2nd could overwrite some of the work done by the slave who came 1st. p  pI know this can be done in codepthreadscode but I didnt want to spend energy coding it up before having some prototype. p  pI wrote a parallel program simulator in MATLAB whichp  ul liOneatatime and sequentially, does the operation which the slave would do and records the time.

Positive 353 pI am working on a big data solution. Usually I start with one chunk of big data, process it, send the results to the next tool to process it even more, and so on. Following is a small example how such a toolchain could look like. Mostly it is not deep 2 or 3 levels and the fanout at the root is also usually smaller than 3. But fanout in the leaves can be easily 100.p  pThese tools come from a variety of sources and can be closed source. So I have no way of bringing the in and output of all tools to a common format. Also, the tools will be written in different languages. C, Java, Python, Bash, ...p  pThe final product will be run on a server with quite a lot of RAM. So I would like to go to an inmemory, sharedmemory solution.p  pThe root tool is a mediator Note This would be my idea to solve my problems, I can be wrong of course and there would be a better approach. The mediator gets as input the toolchain the selection and order of subprocesses will be chosen by the user, calls the different subprocesses, distributes data, recieves signals from the subprocesses when they are finished and the next one can be run. Subprocesses on the same level should be run in parallel.p  pSo now to my questions First of all  is this a good design And second Which APIfunctionsprogramming technique is best suited for calling all these processes so they share the RAM So maybe sharing RAM is not always possible.

Positive 353 pIve developed a model using the program NetLogo. Using the RNetLogo package to run NetLogo using R, I ask the model to run each parameter set simultaneously on 8 processors nodes, then compile the 8 outputs from those runs into a single csv. Then this process is repeated sequentially 3 more times to get a total of 32 84 simulations for each parameter combination. It also gives me 4 separate csvs that I later combine in R into one dataset to analyze. At least this is what I did in the past and it worked great. p  pNow, Ive modified the code somewhat, and I am getting an occasional error that shuts down one of those processes i.e., error on one node shuts down all 8 nodes. So I get 8,16, or 24 simulations instead of 32. p  pI ask each of the 8 replicates to show me how far along they are during the simulation to find out if they are reaching an error somewhere in the middle of the simulation.

We average 2030 inbound connections per minute and each of those connections fire this code. The buyers collection for each of those inbound connections can have from 115 buyers in it. Occasionally our inbound connection count sees a spike to 100 connections per minute and our server grinds to a halt.p  pCPU usage is only around 50 on each server two load balanced 8 core servers but the thread count continues to rise spiking up to 350 threads on the process and our response time for each inbound connection goes from 34 seconds to 1.52 minutes.p  pI suspect the above code is responsible for our scalability problems.

Negative 353 pIt happens quite a lot that Ive a two member enum p  precode        enum  E             A,             B          codepre  pLets say I want to assign a different value to i according to my enum value.p  pshould I write this p  precode        int i e E.A01 codepre  por this p  precode        int i         if eE.A             i0         else if eE.B             i1         else throw new NotImplementedExceptionUnknown enum member for E    e codepre  por maybe this p  precode        int i         switch e                      case E.A                 i  0                 break             case E.B                 i1                 break             default                 throw new NotImplementedExceptionUnknown enum member for E    e          codepre  pI usually go for the first option because its way faster to write, but I always feel a bit wrong about it. What do you usually dop  pI posted the code in c, but this question is not languagerelated.p  pI dont really know how it should be tagged, dont hesitate to retag it if needed.p  pEdit  maybe my question is not clear enough  what Im really wondering is  should I assume that my enum will never change and go for the fast way, or should I consider that it may change although Ive not changed it yet, and add some error handling code so that I dont spend weeks tracking where the bug is if it ever changesp

Negative 353 pHas any one used BITs in VB.NET  If so, do you have code samples and advice  p  pI was looking at SharpBits but I have a VB project that I wanted to use BITS for.  Is it possible to use it with my VB.NET program  .NET 2.0  I was tempted to try to convert each class to VB.NET in the SharpBits.Base folder but figured Id ask in case someone has headed down this route before.p  pEdit  Ok folks in case you run across this question.  What you can do is in the Sharpbits.Base folder that you download from codeplex there is a DLL you can reference in the Bin directory.  You can add that into your references to access it.  Marking Konrad as answer since he was kind enough to post.p  pFurther editbr  I managed to get sharpbits working with some quick code which I pasted below for anyone who might stumble upon this question.  Like I mentioned above add the DLL to your project.p  pre code Dim b As New SharpBits.Base.BitsManager Dim mynewjob As SharpBits.Base.BitsJob    b.CreateJobjobname, SharpBits.Base.JobType.Download mynewjob.AddFileserversharebigfile.zip, cbigfile.zip mynewjob.Resume code pre  pYoull need to write some logic to check for the status of the job.  Once it hits Transferred status you can then mark it as complete.  This will write the file from a .bin to the file name you listed.  Something that helped me was installing the Windows Support Tools you can get it from a Windows 2003 CdDVD in the sup tools folderand using Bitsadmin.exe to view the status of the job while debugging.  Hope this helps the next rookie.  p

Negative 353 pI have a really big log file 9GB  I know I need to fix that on my box. I need to split into chunks so I can upload it to amazon S3 for backup. S3 has a max file size of 5GB. So I would like to split this into several chunks and then upload each one. p  pHere is the catch, I only have 5GB on my server free so I cant just do a simple unix split. Here is what I want to dop  ol ligrab the first 4GB of the log file and spit out into a seperate file call it segment 1li liUpload that segment1 to s3.li lirm segment1 to free up space.li ligrab the middle 4GB from the log file and upload to s3.

Negative 353 pThis is a somewhat subjective question, and not very important in the big scheme of things, but something that yet annoys me regularly. There seems to be no selfevident way to put a strongtimestamp in a file namestrong. p  pObjective issue is that timestamps in file names should be strongsortablestrong.

Negative 353 pIm starting out my expedition into Project Euler. And as many others Ive figured I need to make a prime number generator. Problem is PHP doesnt like big numbers. If I use the standard a hrefhttprosettacode.orgwikiSieve5Fof5FEratosthenesPHP relnofollowSieve of Eratosthenes functiona, and set the limit to 2 million, it will crash. It doesnt like creating arrays of that size. Understandable.p  pSo now Im trying to optimize it.

Negative 353 pI have joined a rails project as a contractor. The project has been going for more than a year. The code is written by about 10 different developers and most of them are contractors as well. They have different code style. Some of them came from Java. The code has horrible scores with metricfu. Many functions are very long 100  300 lines. Some functions have insane amount of logical branches, loops, and recursions. Each request generates a ton of sql queries. Performance is very bad. Many obsolete code that are never used but never got the chance to be cleaned up. The core architecture is plain wrong or over engineered. Code coverage is only about 25. Views and partials are chaotic and terrible to read and understand.p  pThe manager is in a position trying to satisfy the CEO by continuously adding new features, however newer features are increasingly hard to get implemented correctly without breaking something else.

Negative 353 pI am attempting to compress a string via use of a hrefhttpwww.zlib.net relnofollowzliba Ive tried this code with current 1.2.3 version of zlib and with zlib 1.1.3.  bMy code works correctly, unless run on a Japanese machineb.  After compressing a file, I am encrypting it.  The decryption is successful, but the call to uncompress returns 3 codeZDATAERRORcode, meaning the input data was corrupted.  As there are no errors being logged, I know that no exceptions are being thrown, and that the compression function is returning 0 codeZOKcode, meaning it worked.  p  pThus, I suspect the problem is that the codesCompressedcode string is losing integrity on either the line codesCompressed  LeftsCompressed, lcompressedlencode or the line codeencryptedData.Content  sCompressedcode.  Alternatively, VB6 might be doing something strikestupidstrike helpful to the contents of codesCompressedcode during the call to codecompresscode.  I know that the return value of this function is not being corrupted later, because that would have broken decryption, which works fine.p  precodePublic Function EncryptStringByVal Definition As String As String On Error GoTo ErrorHandler     Dim encryptedData As New CAPICOM.encryptedData     encryptedData.SetSecret KEYCONST     Dim lStringLen As Long     Dim lcompressedlen As Long     Dim sCompressed As String     Dim lReturn As Long     Dim tstpost As String     lStringLen  LenDefinition     lcompressedlen  lStringLen  1.01  13     sCompressed  Spacelcompressedlen     lReturn  compresssCompressed, lcompressedlen, Definition, lStringLen     If lReturn ltgt 0 Then         sCompressed  Error  amp CStrlReturn     ltLOG ERRORgt     Else         sCompressed  LeftsCompressed, lcompressedlen     End If     encryptedData.Content  sCompressed     encryptedData.Algorithm.Name  CAPICOMENCRYPTIONALGORITHM3DES     EncryptXmlString  encryptedData.Encrypt Exit Function ErrorHandler     ltLOG ERRORgt     Resume Next End Function codepre  pConclusionbr I ended up making the program give an error message and quit if run on a machine with a suspicious character set.  It is quite likely that this bug still exists on a few settings and also likely that it does not exist on some of the settings that trigger the error.  However, since the target audience is English speakers, passing the Turkey Test is not important enough to justify actually spending more time on this.p

Negative 353 pI have two tables.  Widgets, which has information about each widget Color, size, etc each widget has a unique ID, WidgetID.br  The other table is Tests, and it contains information about multiple tests that were run on each widget. This table, therefore, has multiple rows for each WidgetID. It contains information that we can call WidgetID, Date, Param1, Param2, etc test information.br  I have written a query that finds, for each WidgetID, the most recent two tests by date.  The SQL looks like this  p  pSELECT Widgets.WidgetID, Widgets.Color, Widgets.Size, T.Date, T.Param1, T.Param2,br  FROM Tests AS T INNER JOIN Widgets ON T.WidgetIDWidgets.WidgetIDbr  WHERE Select COUNT FROM Testsbr  WHERE WidgetID  T.WidgetID AND Date  T.Date lt 2 p  pThis works very well. However, it gives me too many widgets.  I have created a query that filters the widgets called WidgetFilter.  It basically just chooses the ones i want based on whatever i choose.  The idea was that I would run the same query replacing Widgets in the code above with WidgetFilter.  However, when I do this it takes forever.  In fact, it just freezes.  I left it for an hour and a half and it just sat there and i had to alt ctl delete.  My only thought is that it is querying the WidgetFilter query for every row of Tests and thats a lot of rows.  I also tried applying the filter criteria within the original query.  I get the same result.  p  pIs there a better way to do this  Either a single query that does it all and possibly doesnt even look like this or what i was thinking is that there should be a way to run the WidgetFilter query once and make that data look to access like a table isnt there such a thing as a temp table.  That way it doesnt run WidgetFilter for every item in Tests.p  pEDITbr  WidgetFilter is actually pretty complex.  I have created these GUI pick tables where the user sees two columns.  The choices on the left and the list heshe is creating on the right and in the middle there is an add button and a delete button.  They then call the report which executes WidgetFilter, yadda yadda yadda.  Anyway, when the user adds an item, it adds that item to a table.  So for the Widget category, Color, there will be a table called ColorList.  The user constructs this list through the gui.  There are three of these guis Color, Size, Type.  For each of them there is a table and there is then a Global boolean eg, ColorFlag that tells which filter to use Color, Size, or Type.br  So, in the WidgetFilter query, the criteria box under Color will have thisbr  InSelect Color From ColorListbr  and there is an expression column Expr1 getColorFlag  which is a module that returns the value of the Global variable ColorFlag.  and it is true at the same time the color table is applied.  So, when all is said and done there are three rows of criteria.  The code looks like this  p  pSelect Widgets.WidgetID, Widgets.Color, Widgets.Size, Widgets.Typebr  From Widgetsbr  WHERE  getColorFlag  True AND Widgets.Color InSelect Color FROM ColorListbr     OR  getSizeFlag   True AND Widgets.Size  InSelect Size  FROM SizeListbr     OR  getTypeFlag   True AND Widgets.Type  InSelect Type  FROM TypeList  p

I love building an app on a solid foundation which definitely separates business logic, presentation logic, and flow of control.p  pHowever, I do a lot of work as well on serversideonly apps, which merely process data and log the process and any relevant results such as import scripts, data migration scripts, web services, TCP socket servers, etc. There is no need for a big fancy MVC framework in these cases.p  pI realize that MVC can still be applied here, but it seems like overkill. Besides a raw procedural approach or a random mashup of class objects, are there any specific Architectural Design Patterns out there especially suited to dataprocessing, runonce, and server daemon type applicationsp

Negative 353 pIm currently coding a product which will have only one database but will host many clients by using a global identifier of a customerid.p  pThis is all very good.p  pHowever, lets say we have a table called Ticket. Idea has a primary key. When a user adds a ticket, the ticket will correspond to the customer via a foreign key etc. p  pHowever, for each customer I want their ticket ids to start from 1 when they sign up. p  pi.e. customer 1 adds 4 tickets, the ticketid count will be 4. Customer 2 signs up, they add a ticket and then the ticketid will be 5 and so on and so forth. Which is not ideal.p  pMy question to you is, how do I get around this if I dont want to use multiple databases The idea of having to update tend, if hundreds of databases with new columns, indexes etc. whenever I make a change would irritate me hugely.p  pHope this makes sense and I look forward to your input.p  pEDIT Tagged as symfony as I will be using Doctrine ORM in symfony to manage the database.... probably irrelevant, but added just in case.p  pEDIT I might also be being stupid and missing something obvious here, so my apologies.p

So I think we cant really use something like the Google Maps API.p  pThe problem is, what is available Are there any databases ready to download which I can use to retrieve this data, or web services that actually allow data mining I am using PHP, though the programming language doesnt really matter.

Negative 353 pIm writing a 2d tilebased engine. Currently, my drawing routine uses the C Drawing library to redraw every visible tile every time the screen refreshes. I got scrolling and zooming to work, and everything looks the way I want it to. But the routine is slow. Now Im trying to improve it. Ive a couple of questionsp  pFirst, I think redrawing the tiles at every refresh is unnecessary since they never change. Right now Im trying to change the algorithm so that it writes the whole map to a single bitmap at initialization, and then cuts the correct portion of the bitmap when its time to draw. Do you think this is the right way to go I also considered leaving the image in the background and just scrolling over it. But then I decided that I dont want to draw stuff thats outside of the fieldofview. However, perhaps that is cheaper than cuttingpasting A memory vs time issuep  pSecond, as far as I understand the C Drawing routines do not use the full power of the GPU. I think I should try to do the drawing in OpenGL or DirectX, but I prefer the former, since it is multiplatform. Will that help Do you know any tiling or general pixeldrawing tutorial for OpenGL A book reference could also help.p  pI also dont do multithreading at the moment in fact I only have a vague idea of what that is. Should I try to multithread the drawer Or would OpenGL make multithreading for graphics redundantp  pThanks.p

Negative 353 pThe restriction of 1024x1024 as the largest image for an iPhone is a problem with iPhone 4. However if an 2x image is used with maximum dimensions of 2048x2048 everything looks equally good on the 4 as it does on a 3  tried and tested in simulator and device. Question is, does the image dimension restriction relate to the UIImage or the resource that it contains I cant imagine resources of more than 1024 pixels are discouraged with the 960 pixel height of the screen.p  pThe right answer is really to use tiles so that things look even better, but the deadline for for this deliverable is too close  its a future thing.p

Negative 353 pI am migrating from Symbian to Android. For symbian based nokia mobile phones, the support for accelerometer sensing using java is by the Mobile Sensor API JSR 256 which is provided in the technical specifications of every nokia mobile phone that supports it.p  pHowever, for Android based HTC Desire mobile phone, I am not sure whether the HTC mobile has to provide for sensor APIs or whether the mobiles support of Android 2.2 is enough to get java code to access the mobiles accelerometer data. Please advise.p  pTo be more specific, I was thinking of writing a java application that uses the accelerometer to act like a wireless mouse for a PC. And then add some extra functionality to it to serve as a general purpose pc controller that takes the z axis into consideration apart from the standard xy axes the mouse uses. For this, should HTC provide for any APIs to access accelerometer data If so, what APIs or is HTCs Android 2.2 enough to achieve this feat Please advise. Thank you in advance.p

Now it is our job to test them.p  pHowever, the amount of websitesfunctionality that we have to test is exorbitant, and multiply that times 3 To check every single link and every single function is a daunting task. We are in the process of manually doing that right now.p  pMy question to you guysgirls is this... Is there a way to automate the testing so we dont have to waste our time clicking, waiting, and checking the response, times 3  p  pLet me know if you need any other info. Thanksp
Negative 353 pI have no choice but to retrieve some external data by means of several codeRuntime.execcode calls to a VBScript.  I truly hate this implementation, as I lose my crossplatform flexibility, but I may eventually develop similar nix scripts to at least mitigate the problem.  Before anyone asks, I emcannotem work around the need to call an external script to gather my data.  I will live with the problems that causes.p  pThe codeexeccode processes are run in a custom class that extends codeRunnablecode.  It uses a codeBufferedReadercode to read in the data from codegetInputStreamcode.p  pemstrongEditstrong more code added as requested, but I dont see how the extra code is relevant  I hope it helps, because it took a while to format Oh, and go easy on my code style if its ugly, but constructive criticism is encouraged...emp  precodepublic class X extends JFrame implements Runnable      ...    static final int THREADSMAX  4    ExecutorService  exec    ...    public static void mainString[] args        ...

However, if I execute the commands in the coderuncode block of the class meaning the calls are concurrent, as I am hoping for, it appears as if only one input stream is generated, which all codeBufferedReaderscode consume concurrently.p  pTo debug the issue, I output each consumed line on the console prefixed by which instance of my class was reading the input stream.  I expect something like the following, understanding that they may be out of order from instancetoinstance, but the line order of a single instance would be intactp  precodeexec 0 Line1 exec 1 Line1 exec 2 Line1 exec 0 Line2 exec 1 Line2 exec 2 Line2 exec 0 Line3 exec 1 Line3 exec 2 Line3 ... codepre  pWhats strange is I get the expected number of instances of the very first line of the output codeMicrosoft R Windows Script Host Version 5.7code, but after this line, only one process continues to produce data in the input stream, and all readers randomlyconsume this one stream, such as this examplep  precodeexec 2 Microsoft R Windows Script Host Version 5.7 exec 0 Microsoft R Windows Script Host Version 5.7 exec 1 Microsoft R Windows Script Host Version 5.7 exec 0 line2 exec 1 line3 exec 2 line4 ... codepre  pTo make matters worse, the readers stall and codereadLinecode never returns null.  I read that this type of behavior might have something to do with the buffer size, but when I run only two concurrent threads, even with a short output, it still exhibits the same behavior.  Nothing is captured in codestdErrcode to indicate there is a problem.p  pTo see if this was a limitation of the script host, I created a batch file that codeSTARTcodes multiple instances of the script concurrently.  strongI should state this was run emoutsideem of Java, in a cmd shell, and launches several of its own shells.strong  However, each concurrent instance fully returned the expected results and behaved well.p  pstrongEditstrong As another troubleshooting idea, I decided to reenable concurrency, but stagger my initialization method by inserting the following into my codeY.runcode blockp  precodetry     Thread.sleepintMath.random  1200  catch InterruptedException e     System.out.printlnCant sleep   End try initializemonitor codepre  pinto my code.  I begin to see multiple outputs for the first few lines, but it quickly reverts to multiple consumers consuming the same producer, and as soon as the first completed stream closes, the rest of the consumers fire exceptions.  The next consumer fires an codeIOException Read errorcode, and the rest fire codeIOException Stream closedcodep  pAccording to maaartinus, it IS possible to run multiple, concurrent codeInputStreamscode, so now the question becomes what is causing the undesired behavior  How can I independently grab their input streams  I dont want to have to write to a temporary file just to process the data back in, if I can avoid it.p

Negative 353 pI fear Ive stumbled into unknown Magento territory. I have exhausted whats left of my Googling abilities and have come up short, so I thought Id try my luck here.p  pOur platform is Magento Enterprise 1.9.1.1.p  pWe use an archaic print solution that reads orders via ODBC. As such, we cant have it read from Magentos MySQL database directly thanks to the high likelihood of change. What Ive done is extend MageSalesModelOrder to intercept the beforeSave function with direct SQL queries to another database, before returning parentbeforeSave. There are likely better ways to have done this, but its done now, and functional, and regardless it is not where my problem lies.p  pIf any SQL errors are thrown, updates are rolled back and the errors amp order data are passed to a function that sends an email to a mailing list with the error information. The email template file in localeenUStemplateemail calls on a .phtml file to process the arrays of data like sop  precodeblock typecoretemplate areafrontend templateemailerrorsorderbeforesave.phtml orderdataorderdata errorserrors  codepre  pThis is functionality I borrowed from localeenUStemplateemailsalesshipmentnew.phtml. And this is also where I hit my roadblock. The email fires fine from the front end, if errors are encountered when the user is processing an order. If you make order changes from adminhtml, the email is sent, but without the above mentioned block.p  pI have tried with and without areafrontend in the block call, and the script exhibits the same behaviour regardless.p  pI think that the problem may be in my XML, though it finds the template itself just fine from both admin and frontend and this block is not required to be defined in my XML anywhere. I can also not find any examples of this within Magentos own files, or anywhere on the internet.p  pAny help would be more than greatly appreciated. This is doing my head inp  ul liMikeli ul

Negative 353 pI am evaluating various  versionsource control options for our legacy  Powerbuilder application in PB11 now, will be migrating to legacy 12  soon. To this point, all the version control with very limited source  control has been done inhouse where the code can be changed by  numerous traveling consultants, but the changes tend to be pushed into  the base by certain module code owners. This workflow was okay for a  while when the company was small, but as we grew, it became more and  more challenging. It is a very large application. Ill give you the  numbers just to get an idea of the scale we are talking about.  Up to 40 PBLS with hundreds of objects in each. About 500MB of code.  About 100 consultants constantly on the road, any of them may be  making base changes, which are then turned over to code owners. p  pSo after reading about and evaluating various options, I was really  excited about Distributed Version Control Systems. I was even more  excited when I found that there is actually a proxy GITSCC, made by  PushOk to get Powerbuilder to work with GIT. When I tried it out with  a small application, I was pleasantly surprised that it worked and  worked relatively well, except for some quirks. However what was  interestingdisturbing is that I cant find a single post on the net  of anybody talking about using GITSCC with Powerbuilder. Even the  PushOKs GITSCC forum had only one post nonPowerbuilder specific  until I created two more.  However, once I put our main application under GIT using GITSCC, I  noticed major performance issues updating PBL statuses. p  pSo now a couple of questions, which I hope someone can help me with p  ol lipIs there anybody who successfully uses GIT with Powerbuilder. If  so, whats your workflow pli lipWhen I refresh PBL statuses I noticed that there are two  operations, which are very time consuming p  ul lipThe log will say Retrieving extended status information for the  files . This is performed one object at a  time with each object taking about 1 second. As you can imagine we are  talking about hours if we are refreshing thousands of objects. pli lipOccasionally, I will get the similar behavior, but with the message  performing diff. Same thing  about a second per objects. Takes  forever. On the source control tab of the workspace properties, I do  have perform diff on status update turned off.  I do not get this behavior every time, I click on a PBL, but once it  starts doing it, you better be ready for a long lunch.  Any way to avoidimprove this behavior. This will be a show stopper as  much as I loved GIT. I saw some people having similar problems with  other source control systems, so I am thinking its either something  to do with Powerbuilder or the proxy. Anything I can tweak in codepb.inicode  or other places to improve the performance pli ulli lipIs there anybody who uses other distributed version control systems  Is there a way to get Mercurial to work with PB I couldnt find any  proxies for it. pli lipFinally, is there another system which you think would work well  with our workflow pli ol  pI tried getting some answers from PushOK, but so far their support has been unresponsive. I also tried the Powerbuilder source control forum, but with so few members in that group, I am hoping to have better luck on SO.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated p

Negative 353 pIm having a little bit of difficulty understanding some architectural principles when developing a service. If you make a call to a WCF service and it returns a collection of itemsOrders which are custom made classes made up From  LINQtoSQL  entity data to a client and each item has a collection of itemsOrderItems onetomany that are also made up from the same LINQtoSQL context. If I make another call to the service and request a particular OrderItem and modify its details on the client side, how then does the first collection of Items realise that one of its Orders OrderItem has changed from the client side. I am taking the approach of when changing the OrderItem I send the OrderItem object to the WCF service for storage via LINQtoSQL commands but to update the collection that the client first called I use IList interface to search and replace each instance of the OrderItem. Also subscribing each item to the PropertyChanged event give some control. This does work with certain obvious limitations but how would one more correctly approach this by perhaps managing all of the data changing from the service itself.. ORM static classes If this is too difficult question to answer, perhaps some link or even chat group that I can discuss this as I understand that this site is geared for quick QA type topics rather than guided tutorial discussions.p  pThanks all the same.p  pChris Leachp

Negative 353 pImagine you have a page that is of a specific page type for example normal page, account page etc. The page is represented by a Page object. p  pMy question is, how would you assign a page type to a pagep  pI see these optionsp  ol liby using a PageType enum that is set in the Page object. li liby using a PageType class, and assigning instances of it in the Page object. li liby using page tags, which are simple strings associated with the Page object.li ol  pOption 1 is codeonly approach, so adding new page types means changing core code. Option 2 is more flexible, but there is additional overhead in having to maintain these page types.  Option 3 is very flexible, because theres no maintenance and its extendable to other mechanisms than page type. But you can easily break things because there are no constraints.p  pWhat would be other objective reasons to choose one over the otherp

Negative 353 pI have just started creating my first website, which is backed by a database this is also my first db. Due to my total inexperience, I have no idea if I should rely on jQuery or PHP for a specific task, and am hoping that someone might be able to provide some insight. This is a best practices question. p  pIn the table Files, there are 6 fields and approximately 50 rows. Users are shown all of the information in the table, and are able to apply filters via checkboxes to manipulate how that data is displayed. For example, if the boxes emcategory  DNAem and emkeyword  assayem are checked, a php script selects those rows in the db where the fields emcategoryem and emkeywordem have the values emDNAem and emassay,em respectively. This information is then returned to a jQuery script as a JSON object for formatting and insertion into the DOM I used .getJSON.p  pSo far, this works just fine. However, upon reading that too many queries to a db incurs a performance penalty, I wrote a new jQuery script which gets ALL of the information from the table Files immediately after the document loads. This information is distributed into 6 different arrays i.e. emcategory[ ]em and emkeyword[ ]em, with the index of a given row the same in all 6 arrays. Then, if the same filters as above are applied, I search the emcategory[ ]em and emkeyword[ ]em arrays. The information associated with the index emiem is displayed if the strings emDNAem and emassayem are found in emcategory[ i ]em and emkeyword[ i ]em. p  pObviously, the second method reduces the number of queries to the db. However, it feels wrong to me in that I am using jQuery for something that isnt exactly behavior, and I doubt that jQuery is as fast at searching arrays as MySQL is at finding rows in a table. Testing both versions of the site, they seem to perform equally well, but I am only able to test the site locally. I imagine that the jQuery version will become less viable if the table grows to be very large, but it is unlikely that it will ever exceed 100 rows. p  pIf you have any advice, I would greatly appreciate any help in deciding which option I should implement. Thank you in advance for your input, and I hope youll accept my apologies for being such a noobp

Negative 353 pIm pretty new to load testing with VS, but I think Ive set everything up normally, and Im having a problem where execution of my Load Test quickly spikes to 100 CPU utilization.  It seems likely that this will affect my test results and I assume its not the anticipated behavior.p  pMy hardware platform is a beefy developer machine a few months old with a quadcore, 12GB RAM, 2 IDE drives and a fast NIC.  I can elaborate if necessary, but usually Id say it screams.p  pIm testing an MVC23 application that runs locally on Win7 x64, against MSSQL 2008, using VS2010 SP1, C.NET 4.  p  pThe underlying test is a Unit Test that exercises a single MVC controller method, which uses Unity and other EntLib libraries to pull a collection of clients back from the database, according to the users rights.  Typical execution time for the Unit Test is 0.4 to 0.6 seconds.p  pThe Load Test is set to expose the performance problem and runs for 10 minutesp  ul liInitial User Count 1li liStep Duration 30li liStep User Count 1li ul  pObservationsp  ol lipFor the first 30 seconds as a single user, execution is a bit erratic.  The first test takes 3 sec, which is normal warmup.  The next 15 or so take about .4 sec, which is perfect.  Just after 10 seconds, though, tests start running for 5 sec.  This is strongbeforestrong the 2nd virtual user comes on.  As additional virtual users come on, test times increase gradually, which is to be expected, though the runtimes still seem long.pli lipMore concerning is that CPU utilization spikes around user 6 it was averaging around 20 prior across all 8 cores.  At user 6 and 7, CPU goes to 70 and is pegged at 100 on 8 cores by user 8, and it stays there until the test ends after 10 minutes.  Needless to say, for a normal stepped test, Id like to start with 10 concurrent users and go up to 100 or more, but my CPU starts at 100, and the results are surely inaccurate.pli ol  pThe cuprit is clearly QTAGENT.EXE, as I can see from the executing tasks.  It uses every spare CPU cycle from what I can see.  Ive run this Load Test in 32bit mode as well, and QTAGENT32.EXE runs similarly.p  pIm at a loss for why Im experiencing this problem, let alone what to do about it.  Any proposals or solutions are appreciated.  TIAp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI found that a workaround to my problem is to start the load test by clicking Debug Test instead of Run Test.  This doesnt really make any sense to me, in fact its like the exact opposite of what Id expect however, I cant deny its consistently running my tests with 100s of users and only semithrashing my CPU 50 average with spikes.p

Negative 353 pProblem statement An image A is projected through a projector, goes through a microscope and the projected image is captured via a camera through the same microscope as image B. Due to the optical elements, the B is rotated, sheared and distorted with respect to A. Now, I need to transform A into A before projection such that B is as close to A as possible.p  pInitial approach I took a checkerboard pattern and rotated it at various angles 36, 72, 108, ... 324 degrees and projected to get a series of A images and B images. I used OpenCVs CalibrateCamera2, InitUndistortMap and Remap functions to convert B into B. But B is nowhere near A and rather similar to B especially there is a significant amount of rotation and shearing that is not getting corrected.p  pThe code in Python is below. I am not sure if I am doing something stupid.

Negative 353 phey guys have a real problem with jQuery Mobile, Ive tried to fix but Ive failed  I have a Navigation to browse trough my app and if I click on a link which is related to a site, which has a .js file for doing some functions, the .js file is lost. If I look at firebug, I dont see my specified getmarkerid.js in the section of my code. If I refresh the page, the .js file appears and all is fine, all functions were found and work perfectly.p  pAs a workaround I figuered out that to give the Tag of the Navigation an coderelexternalcode attribute solves this problem because the site is loaded completely and not from an ajax call. p  pNow I want to know if I can solve the problem with an better workaround  Because if I use the coderelexternalcode the mobile Safari opens a new Tab, if I had saved the Page to my homescreen and this is what my customers not want .

Negative 353 pIn C03, template parameter deduction does not occur in some contexts. For examplep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt struct B   template lttypename Tgt struct A      typedef BltTgt type   template lttypename Tgt void ftypename AltTgttype  int main      Bltintgt b     fb   ERROR no match  codepre  pHere, codeintcode is not deduced for codeTcode, because a nested type such as codeAltTgttypecode is a nondeduced context.p  pHad I written the function like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt struct B   template lttypename Tgt void fBltTgt  int main      Bltintgt b     fb  codepre  peverything is fine because codeBltTgtcode strongisstrong a deduced context.p  pIn C11, however, template aliases can be used to disguise a nested type in syntax similar to the second example. For examplep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt struct B   template lttypename Tgt struct A      typedef BltTgt type   template lttypename Tgt using C  typename AltTgttype  template lttypename Tgt void fCltTgt  int main      Bltintgt b     fb  codepre  pWould template argument deduction work in this case In other words, are template aliases a deduced context or a nondeduced context Or do they inherit the deducednondeduced status of whatever they aliasp

Negative 353 pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidemarketbillingbillingbestpractices.htmlSecurity and Designa guidelines go to great length outlining various methods to make it more difficult for an attacker to compromise inapp billing implementation.p  pEspecially noted is how easy it is to reverseengineer a code.apkcode file, even if obfuscated via Proguard. So they even recommend modifying all sample application code, especially known entry points and exit points.p  pWhat I find missing is any reference to the wrapping certain verification methods in a single method, like the static codeSecurity.verifycode which returns codebooleancode A good design practice reducing code duplication, reusable, easier to debug, selfdocumenting, etc. but all an attacker needs to do now is identify that method and make it always return codetruecode... So regardless how many times I used it, delayed or not delayed, randomly or not, it simply doesnt matter.p  pOn the other hand, Java doesnt have macros like in CC, which allows reducing source code duplication, but doesnt have a single exit point for a codeverifycode function.p  pSo my questions p  pIs there an inherent contention between the well known software engineeringcoding practices and design for so called security in the context of JavaAndroidsecure transactions at leastp  pWhat can be done to mitigate the sideeffects of design for security which seems like shooting oneself in the foot in terms of overcomplicating software that could have been simpler, more maintainable and easier to debugp  pCan you recommend good sources for further studying this subjectp

Negative 353 pIm developing an iPad application and I need to create an codeUIViewcode that is always on top in respect to other views.p  pA is the area consider it as a sort of sidebar where I need to create a codeUIViewControllercode which view remains always on top.

As requirements I need that A always overlaps B. In other words, a portion of B the left part is always under the area of A. B always extends the entire device screen.p  pCould you give me some advicep  pI made two configurations but I have problem with them.p  pstrongFirst Configurationstrongp  pIn the first one, I created an codeUIViewControllercode for A called codeSideBarControllercode. I added codeSideBarControllercode view to codeUIWindowcode within the application delegate. Then I created an codeUIViewControllercode for B called codeHomeViewControllercode and I added it as a coderootViewControllercode for my application.p  pThis solution could be a valid one because I can change the content area dinamically setting a new coderootViewControllercode through my application delegate but the codeSideBarControllercode remains always under the current visble view.p  pstrongSecond Configurationstrongp  pIn the second one, I created an codeUIViewControllercode called codeMainViewControllercode and I added it as a coderootViewControllercode for my application. Then within codeMainViewControllercode I created an codeUIViewControllercode for A called codeSideBarControllercode and I added codeSideBarControllercode view to codeMainViewControllercode. Then the content area has been filled creating an codeUIViewControllercode for B called codeHomeViewControllercode and adding it to codeMainViewControllercode.p  pThe sidebar remains always on top but I have difficulties to change dynamically the content area within codeMainViewControllercode.

Negative 353 pI am not very familiar with the OAuth flow andor encoding, but Ive managed to get my site somewhat working as an OAuth provider.p  pI am saying strongsomehowstrong, because for a long time I was getting the Invalid signature error when using the access token to fetch the protected information I successfully got a request token, authorized it and got the access token.p  pSo I looked a little over the signature generation method I am using Drupal 7 and some undocumented modules.

We have received no complaints that users are not being redirected to codeRedirectDestinationcode so, to our mind, everything should be working as expected  both the codepageTracker.trackEventcode should fire and the iframe HTTP request be sent, then the user should be redirected. p  pNow its entirely possible that the thirdparty is misunderstanding what theyre supposed to be sending us and are mailing over a subset of the data we want which is their equivalent of the 813 GA events.

The Web Service service itself is a Spring MVC based web service that runs on the Tomcat application server. p  pNow i need to write a Thick client which will be a standalone Java app that will use the services of the web service. I think i am correct in that the client only needs to know about the service details i.e. operations and nothing else. p  pWhat i am not sure of is the architecture and environment i should use for the client. The client application will be based on Swing but is it possible to use Spring with Swing togetherp  pOn the web service i have the following setup p  pview  Service  Modelp  pThe client application is basically a configuration tool. It uses the web service to configure user accounts. This means that the client application does not actually write anything to any database.

Is there any benefit in using Spring with the Swing based client  Are there any alternative or better solutionsdesignarchitecture that would achieve the samep  pAn example showing Spring used in conjunction with a Swing application would be very usefull. p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 353 pIm working on a clientserver application .NET 4, WCF that must support backwards compatibility. In other words, old clients should be compatible with new servers and vice versa.

Luckily, were allowed to break backwards compatibility with every minor release. When we get to a point where compatibility can be broken, Id like to clean up the code thats in the form of the example above.p  pMy questionsp  p1 Is there a way to easily identify code blocks such as these when they are no longer valid My initial thoughts were to somehow conditionally apply an Obsolete attribute based on the assemblys version. When we get to a new minor version, the Obsolete attribute would kickin, and all of a sudden we would have several compiler warnings pointing to these code blocks... Has anyone done anything like this Or is there a better way to manage thisp  p2 I cringe every time I see hardcoded versions such as codenew Version2, 1, 3code. What makes things worse is that during development, we dont know the final Version thats being released, so the version checks are based on the current build number  1 when the developer adds the check. Although this works, its not very clean. Any ideas on how this could be improvedp  pThanksp

Negative 353 pI have multiple tabs that have different data inside. The first tab has ListView which basically fills the whole TabPage.

It just gives more place for data if theres not enough of it to fill the whole space. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compXzJK.png altenter image description herep  pHowever Im having problems with other Tabs which basically holds some GroupBoxes with some TextBoxes like on screen below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEAmiQ.png altenter image description here p  pThe amount of data is always static, and this is where I have problems. It looks OK on small screens as the TextBoxes and GroupBoxes fill in nicely. But on larger monitors I dont know what to do with it. Either I can make TextBoxes larger but seems extremely unpractical for some fields and having Street Name going from one side of Monitor to the other doesnt seems like a logic choice at all. I can make Groupboxes to fill the space but still its an empty space and looks ... well empty. Is this normal to left it like that, or what to do with such empty space I cant really move more stuff into it as on smaller screens it will be problematic. Is there anything one can do about design of thisp

Negative 353 pIm encountering an error sprintf statement.

However, the double is interpreted correctly the first time it is called in the printf statement. By increasing the size name from 120 to 320, the segfault does go away.

Negative 353 pI have read some of the basic googleappsscript GAS documentationtutorials. I have not found any explanation of the scope of code execution. p  pHere is what I understand so far p  precode All code consists of one or more statements  All statements must  be contained in a function      a slight different from nongoogle javascript  is this a false assumption   All functions reside in a container called a file  Each file is part of a project container or library  Each project container is stored in a spreadsheet container. codepre  pThese are the physical edit access boundaries.p  pMy question is what is the logical boundaries of statementsbr during executionp  pI started by assuming all variablesobjects were global in scope, similar to the way that Javascript operates in a webpage.  I did not think that edit access containers limited the scope of variableobject definitions. I was wrong.p  pI thought that a library structure is similar to a PHP include operation. By that I thought it would save me from having to copy the same set of  code into every application spreadsheet container, in which I needed to use the already tested code. I assumed the resources available to the  included project were the same as those available to the including project common resources. In short, I was wrong. The properties were stored in the defining spreadsheet, and are considered to be owned by the containing project.  p  pFrom playing with it, I now understand that the project key just adds a new namespace to the spreadsheet container.  What happens in each  namespace remains in that namespace. The only simplest communication between the namespaces is via function parameters and return value. p  pIn particular, User and Project properties are scoped to and remain in their containing spreadsheet document. Each project within the spreadsheet document has separate set of User and Project properties. p  pThe same projectlibrary name can appear in multiple spreadsheet files and are totally independent. p  pIs this documented somewhere And are there other things I need to know about scoping communication across threads from different applications sharing the same projectlibrary p  pAlso, if a function passes back a reference to an object defined in the library scope, will it persist in the callings project  Can I passreturn a variable that points to a projects UserProperties sevice object and have access to that data in another projectp
Negative 353 pI have an issue with a flash application that is loaded in HTTP, then gets data from diffrent domains over HTTPS. The crossdomain.xml on each site is configured to support this and it works in Chrome, Firefox and IE9. However in IE8 and lower i get a  Error 2044 Unhandled ioError. textError 2032 Stream Error error.  When using Charles to debug it i can see that the request is made and that its served by the server, which means that the error have to be caused when it tries to read the data it gets back. I have close to zero experience in programming in flashas3 and have been looking at tons of similar questions on this site without finding a solution. Seems this often relates to crossdomain or an incorrect url, but since it works in other browsers and all gets served according to charles this cannot be caused by that.p  pThanks in advance.p

Integers are distribute in the structure unevenly, meaning that some structures will contain just a few elements, while others may have millions of them, taking positions from zero to code0xFFFFFFFFcode.p

Negative 353 pI have a radio button group and some other drop down selections to filter a view.  These use an onclick SSJS event to change the view when the user selects a value.  I also have a onclick event in a link on the view items.  All works great unless I let the web page sit for more than 30 minutes.  Then the onclick SSJS events all stop working. I assume a session is timing out. Is this what is happeningp  pOf course, I could increase this, but, is there a way to detect in client side JS that the session has timed out so I could then refresh the web page I dont care if I lose the values the user selected. But, having all these onclick events go dead on the user makes the page unusable until they refresh the page.p  pI tried the keepalive control from the Ext. Lib but that had no effectp  pHowardp

Negative 353 pIt was tricky to write a title for this. What I currently do, is to reuse one Fragment class to create a multitude of ListFragments in a ViewPager. The layout of the ListFragments are all the same so having just one layout and one Fragment as a base seems like a sound choice. However, Id like to be able to access each Fragments views, in order to set some perFragment values, such as a title, a name and whatnot. I have an issue with this and its the fact that whenever I try to access a TextView by overriding a Fragments onViewCreatedmethod, it seems to me that the only Fragment getting updated is the first one in the chain.p  pNow, what I do to instantiate and connect the Fragments is thisp  precodeprivate void initPager      mFragments  new VectorltFragmentgt     int[] listIds  3     forint i  0 i lt listIds.length i          Fragment fragment  new ListsFragmentlistIds[i]         mFragments.addfragment           FragmentManager fragmentManager  getSupportFragmentManager     FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction  fragmentManager.beginTransaction     forint i  0 i lt mFragments.size i          fragmentTransaction.addR.id.viewpager, mFragments.geti          fragmentTransaction.commit      mPagerAdapter  new ListsPagerAdapterfragmentManager, mFragments     mPager  ViewPager super.findViewByIdR.id.viewpager     mPager.setAdaptermPagerAdapter  codepre  pThe Fragment onViewCreated code is thisp  precode    Override public void onViewCreatedView view, Bundle savedInstanceState      super.onViewCreatedview, savedInstanceState     TextView textListTitle  TextView getActivity.findViewByIdR.id.textlisttitle             String title  test     textListTitle.setTextlistTitle  codepre  pWhen looking at logs I see that each Fragment is instantiated separatly, going through the lifecycle of each in succession. However, the only Fragment getting the teststring is the first one.p  pWhat am I missingp

Negative 353 pI am a beginner starting to learn android application development. Most of the Tutorials I have come through show screenshots of getting an option saying Android Project however the option I get says Android application project. I just wanted to know if there is a difference between these two. I am running Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and Eclipse Juno and Java 7 and Android 4.1 SDK. The tutorials I see usually have older versions of all the software. So, it has been a bit confusing for me to follow them. I guess these are a beginners teething problems. Can somebody help me get around them by suggesting me reference material that would help a beginner like me Just so I dont hit anymore bumps like these. The palette view and everything else does not seem to be the same either. Which is the reason maybe why I got confused. Thank you for your time. All your help is much appreciated.p

Negative 353 pSo I just started trying out some multithreaded programming for the first time, and Ive run into this heap corruption problem. Basically the program will run for some random length of time as short as 2 seconds, as long as 200 before crashing and spitting out a heap corruption error. Everything Ive read on the subject says its very hard thing to diagnose, since the what triggers the error often has little to do with what actually causes it. As such, I remain stumped.p  pI havent been formally taught multithreading however, so I was mostly programming off of what I understood of the concept, and my code may be completely wrong. So heres a basic rundown of what Im trying to do and how the program currently tries to handle itp  pIm writing code for a simple game that involves drawing several parallaxing layers of background. These levels are very large eg 20000x5000 pixels, so obviously trying to load 3 layers of those sized images is not feasible if not impossible. So currently the images are split up into 500x500 images and I have the code only have the images it immediately needs to display held in memory. Any images it has loaded that it no longer needs are removed from memory. However, in a single thread, this causes the program to hang significantly while waiting for the image to load before continuing.p  pThis is where multithreading seemed logical to me. I wanted the program to do the loading it needed to do, without affecting the smoothness of the game, as long as the image was loaded by the time it was actually needed. So here is how I have it organizedp  p1. All the data for where the images should go and any data associated with them is all stored in one multidimensional array, but initially no image data is loaded. Each frame, the code checks each position on the array, and tests if the spot where the image should go is within some radius of the player.p  p2. If it is, it flags this spot as needing to be loaded. A pointer to where the image should be loaded into is pushbackd onto a vector.p  p3. The second thread is started once the level begins. This thread is initially passed a pointer to the aforementioned vector.p  p4. This thread is put into an infinite While loop which by itself sounds wrong that only terminates when the thread is terminated. This loop continuously checks if there are any elements in the vector. If there are, it grabs the 0th element, loads the image data into that pointer, then .erases the element from the vector. p  pThats pretty much a rundown of how it works. My uneducated assumption is that the 2 threads collide at some point trying to write and delete in the same space at once or something. Given that Im new to this Im certain this method is terrible to some embarrassing degree, so Im eager to hear what I should improve upon.p  pEDIT  Adding source code upon requestp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeclass ImageLoadQueue  private ImageHandle image stdstring path int frameWidth, frameHeight, numOfFrames public ImageLoadQueue ImageLoadQueueImageHandle a, stdstring b, int c, int d, int e1  setDataa,b,c,d,e   void setDataImageHandle a, stdstring b, int c, int d, int e1      image  a     path  b     frameWidth  c     frameHeight  d     numOfFrames  e  void loadThisImage  imagegtloadImagepath, frameWidth, frameHeight, numOfFrames, numOfFrames    class ImageLoadThread  public sfThread  private stdvectorltImageLoadQueuegt images  public ImageLoadThread   ImageLoadThreadstdvectorltImageLoadQueuegt a  linkVectora   void linkVectorstdvectorltImageLoadQueuegt a  images  a  virtual void Run      while 11               if imagesgtempty                      images[0]gtloadThisImage             imagesgteraseimagesgtbegin                         class LevelArt  private int levelWidth, levelHeight, startX, startY, numOfLayers float widthScale, heightScale, widthOfSegs, heightOfSegs float parallaxFactor ImageHandle levelImages int frame int numOfFrames bool tileLayer bool isLoaded Animation animData stdstring imagePath  stdvectorltImageLoadQueuegt imageQueue ImageLoadThread imageThread   public LevelArtvoid LevelArtstdstring LevelArtvoid  void loadDatastdstring void drawLevelsfRenderWindow, float, float void scaleLevelfloat, float void forceDrawsfRenderWindow void wipeLevel void initialLoad  int getLevelWidth  return levelWidth  int getLevelHeight  return levelHeight  int getTotalWidth  return widthOfSegslevelWidth  int getTotalHeight  return heightOfSegslevelHeight  int getStartX  return startX  int getStartY  return startY   codepre  pThats most of the relevant threading code, in this header.

Negative 353 pIm playing around a bit with the concept of Comet on node.js, but Im still a bit confused and Im wondering if anyone here can point me in the right direction.p  pThink on a game app where client code should ask for its turn to make a move for example on a chess app. What Im thinking here is in use something like thisp  pWhen match starts a method on the node server is called to create an element on a matches array with the id of the match and the initial player.p  pWhen a player makes a move a method is called to update the current player on the array element referencing this match. This method should fire an event when the change occurs.p  pBefore being able to make any move, client code should call a method on the server that checks if its the turn of the user and that waits for the changing player event if wasnt its turn.p  pIm not sure if this is a good approach within the event loop, and if it is I dont see how can I make the method to wait until event to return.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 353 pWhy do people use this kind of CSS and HTML to style their pagesp  precodeltdiv classpagegt   ltdiv classpageleftcolumngt     ltdiv classpageleftcolumncontainerboxgt       ltdiv classpageleftcolumncontainerboxelementheaderwrappergt          lth2gtThis is the headerlth2gt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe above markup would be accompanied by CSS rules like thisp  precode.pageleftcolumncontainerboxelementheaderwrapper    color red  codepre  pWhy not write it like thisp  precodeltdiv classpagegt   ltdiv classleft columngt     ltdiv classcontainerboxgt       ltdiv classelement headerwrappergt          lth2gtThis is the headerlth2gt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd then make the CSS rule perhaps not all of this would be requiredp  precode.page .left.column .containerbox .element.headerwrapper    color red  codepre  pAs far as I can see, the latter is much superior to the first one. It is easier to specify CSS rules without having to copypaste everything all over the place because you can specify rules like code.containerbox .elementcode and code.column .headerwrappercode. In my opinion, this also makes the rules, code and everything more maintainable. The only downside to this is that if you write CSS rules like this code.page .left.column .containerbox .element.headerwrappercode then the selector will have a dependency to a deep HTML hierarchy. However, the codepageleftcolumncontainerboxelementheaderwrappercode may not have such a hard dependency to the hierarchy but obviously changing the hierarchy would make one want to update the false class name, would it notp  pThe only reason I can imagine for using class names like codepageleftcolumncontainerboxelementheaderwrappercode is that perhaps using slightly more complex selectors is computationally expensive and makes the browser slow. Can this be true Are there other programmingrelatedtechnical advantages that Im just not seeing Or is it just that rules that use multiple elements, classes and ids are complicatedp

Negative 353 pA bit of a philosophical question, I suppose. Hope it belongs here.p  pC language has the standard set of bitwise operations, including codeORcode, codeANDcode, codeXORcode, codeSHIFT LEFTRIGHTcode, codeNOTcode. Anyone has an idea why rotate leftrotate right isnt included in the language These operators are of the same complexity as other bitwise operators and normally require a single assembly instruction, like the others. Besides, I can think of a lot of uses for rotate operator, probably not less than, say, codexorcode operator  so it sounds a bit strange to me that they arent included in C along with the rest.p  pstrongEditstrong Please stop suggesting implementations of rotation operators. I know how to do that and its not what the question about.p

Negative 353 pA program I am writing for work needs to keep track of the memory used by itself. But it cant monitor its memory usage as a whole, I need it to monitor each object in the program and how much memory that object is using, that way it can then tell that object to cut back on memory usage if it using above a certain capacity. The part that monitors memory usage holds a pointer to all created objects and keeps track of their memory usage by calling a method on that object that returns the size of the object.p  pThe problem Im having is that I cannot accurately calculate the size of the memory used. It doesnt matter if my calculation are off by a little bit but Im getting big difference. The size that my program calculates varies depending on which actions the program performs between 12 to 23 of the actual memory usage of the program. For example a program that used 3.35gb of ram was calculated to only be using 2.16gb.p  pThe current way I calculate the size of an object is by adding sizeofthis to the length of any vectors or arrays in the object multiplied by the sizeof the elements in the vectorarray.p  pIs there something wrong with the way Im calculating the memory used Or is there just something else Im not taking into account If anyone knows of a program that you can analyse memory usage by different aspects of a program that would also be very helpful, that way I can track down where all this extra memory is coming from preferably one that can run on Linux without GUI as Im using Ubuntu server, but also have a windows machine I can use.p

Negative 353 pI just cant get my head straight about this one. Im currently building a rather largescale application on Android. Ive run in to a couple of problems regarding security and authentication though...p  h2The Scenarioh2  pI have an application thats making calls through HTTP will implement SSL later to a server running PHP and MySQL. Of course i want to use the existing userdatabase, so migration to another DB is not a solution.. Ive managed to create the register users via Android to the serverfunctionality. Ive also made a working login, BUT this is where the problems start.p  pAs users in the Android application Iam working on adds, edits, deletes and sync stuff on the server viato the application, things get rather complicated. A little too complicated for me it seems p  h2Problemsh2  ol lipAs I get the result from my serverside login and pass it from the server to Android via JSON, the connection dies and serverside I aint loggedon sessions dies whereas on the phone Iam. How can I make the logon persistent both on the server and in Android without the need to logon again So that subsequent calls from Android to the server is made with the same user, still authenticated.  I.e. I want sort of a onetime login till I logout like in the Spotifyapp and many others.pli lipIf Ive understood things right, implementing SSL correct makes it     possible to send passwords in clear text to the server without the need to hash them first. Is this correctpli ol  pI just cant stop thinking about the fact that a MIMattack would compromise any unique id I send from Android to the server. My first thought was to have the UID on the Android device as a key to the server after a successful logon. But if that key gets in the wrong hands, the user associated with that UID will be compromised. Ive looked at the AccountManager on Android but it seems rather overkill in my case.p  pIf someone could supply examples or at least guidelines, Id be much gratefulp  pThanks in advacep  h2ADDED SOLUTION DIAGRAM AFTER EDITh2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVPiur.png altImage describing the mechanism of the authenticationp  pNotice that this diagram shows the first start of the application.

Negative 353 pI have a layered window using SetLayeredWindowAttributes.

Negative 353 pOn January 2013, Facebook had changed the way the publicly reported DAU and MAU figures are interpreted. Instead of reporting exact MAU amp DAU figures per app, Facebook started categorizing each app into a MAU amp DAU tiers, thus reported MAU amp DAU numbers are rounded into tiers or levels.

Negative 353 pIn my project Visual C 2010 Express, wxWidgets 2.9.4 Im using a few TextCtrl objects which are supposed to be associated with three variables a0,a1,a2  representing coefficients of a parabola via a wxFloatingPointValidator. These are then used to plot the function using wxMathPlot. The coefficients are members of the wxFrame class where everything else is defined. The program revolves around the Calculate button  triggers the OnCalculate method which computes the x and y coordinates of the function and adds a layer to the mplot wxMathPlot object. For some reason, the validators do not pass the input values at all to the member fields I traced this down in debug mode. I have been referring to a few sample code snippets, e.g. a hrefhttpdocs.wxwidgets.orgtrunkclasswxfloatingpointvalidator.html relnofollowhttpdocs.wxwidgets.orgtrunkclasswxfloatingpointvalidator.htmla It seems to me that my implementation is pretty much the same but does not give the desired effect. Any help will be much appreciated...p  pNote I tried different things, such as placing the validators and text boxes inside vectors to make the code tidier but went with this version to make it a bit more apparent as to what Im doing. Also, there used to be no default values for a0, a1 and a2 with the same effect it plots a straight line at y0.p  pEDIT I also tried putting the variables a0, a1 and a2 in a separate class and defining them globally like in the official wxValidator sample  same effect...p  precodeinclude wxwx.h include ltwxvalnum.hgt       wxFloatingPointValidator include ltwxbookctrl.hgt     make tabs in the window include mathplot.h        plotting include ltvectorgt  class MyApp public wxApp      virtual bool OnInit   class MyFrame public wxFrame  public     MyFrameconst wxStringamp title, const wxPointamp pos, const wxSizeamp size     wxBookCtrl  book     wxTextCtrl  textBox0,  textBox1,  textBox2     double a0,a1,a2     stdvectorltdoublegt xcoords, ycoords     mpWindow  mplot      void OnQuitwxCommandEventamp event     void OnCalculatewxCommandEventamp event      DECLAREEVENTTABLE   enum      IDQuit  1,     IDtextBox,     BUTTONcalculate   BEGINEVENTTABLEMyFrame, wxFrame     EVTMENUIDQuit, MyFrameOnQuit     EVTBUTTONBUTTONcalculate, MyFrameOnCalculate ENDEVENTTABLE  IMPLEMENTAPPMyApp  bool MyAppOnInit      MyFrame frame  new MyFrame wxPlotter, wxPoint50, 50, wxSize450,340      framegtShowtrue     SetTopWindowframe     return true   MyFrameMyFrameconst wxStringamp title, const wxPointamp pos, const wxSizeamp size  wxFrame NULL, 1, title, pos, size       a00 a10 a20    default values      wxMenu menuFile  new wxMenu     menuFilegtAppend IDQuit, ampExit      wxMenuBar menuBar  new wxMenuBar     menuBargtAppend menuFile, ampFile      SetMenuBar menuBar       book  new wxBookCtrlthis, 1      wxPanel panel1  new wxPanelbook      wxFloatingPointValidatorltdoublegt val04,ampa0,wxNUMVALDEFAULT     textBox0  new wxTextCtrlpanel1, IDtextBox, 0.0000, wxPoint40, 30, wxSize60,20, wxTEPROCESSENTER, val0, wxTextCtrlNameStr      wxFloatingPointValidatorltdoublegt val14,ampa1,wxNUMVALDEFAULT     textBox1  new wxTextCtrlpanel1, IDtextBox, 0.0000, wxPoint40, 60, wxSize60,20, wxTEPROCESSENTER, val1, wxTextCtrlNameStr      wxFloatingPointValidatorltdoublegt val24,ampa2,wxNUMVALDEFAULT     textBox2  new wxTextCtrlpanel1, IDtextBox, 0.0000, wxPoint40, 90, wxSize60,20, wxTEPROCESSENTER, val2, wxTextCtrlNameStr      new wxButton panel1, BUTTONcalculate, TCalculate, wxPoint150,30, wxSize100,30      bookgtAddPagepanel1, TInput, true    move the page to the tab      wxBoxSizer topsizer  new wxBoxSizer wxVERTICAL      wxPanel panel2  new wxPanelbook     panel2gtSetSizertopsizer      mplot  new mpWindow panel2, 1, wxPoint0,0, wxSize100,100, wxSUNKENBORDER      mplotgtSetMargins0,0,50,70     mpScaleX xaxis  new mpScaleXwxTx, mpALIGNBOTTOM, true     mpScaleY yaxis  new mpScaleYwxTy, mpALIGNLEFT, true     xaxisgtSetDrawOutsideMarginsfalse     yaxisgtSetDrawOutsideMarginsfalse     mplotgtAddLayerxaxis     mplotgtAddLayeryaxis     mplotgtFit5.,5.,5,5.,0,0     topsizergtAdd mplot, 1, wxEXPAND      bookgtAddPagepanel2, TPlot, false    false to make this a secondary tab gt not displayed upon initialisation   void MyFrameOnQuitwxCommandEventamp WXUNUSEDevent    defines what happens when quit is pressed      CloseTRUE     closes the window   void MyFrameOnCalculatewxCommandEventamp WXUNUSEDevent      for int i0 ilt1000 i              xcoords.pushbacki.1         ycoords.pushbacka0a1xcoords[i]a2powxcoords[i],2.           mpFXYVector vectorLayer  new mpFXYVectorParabola      vectorLayergtSetDataxcoords, ycoords     vectorLayergtSetContinuitytrue     wxPen vectorpenwxBLUE, 2, wxSOLID     vectorLayergtSetPenvectorpen     vectorLayergtSetDrawOutsideMarginsfalse      mplotgtAddLayervectorLayer     mplotgtFit5.,5.,5,5.,0,0  codepre

Negative 353 pI want to use d3.js to interact with marked text in CodeMirror. However, to mark text in CodeMirror, you call codemarkTextfrom,to, class myclasscode and it creates a span around the text with class codemyclasscode.p  pI wish to mark many pieces of text based on data and then add some event handling and such to them. Thus, I would like to do something likep  precodevar box  d3.selectAllbox.datamyData box.enter.eachfunctiond cm.markTextfromd, tod, class box box.onmouseover, functiond ... box.exit.remove codepre  pHowever, d3s enter selections only support codeappendcode, codeinsertcode, and codeselectcode. I tried faking the effect with codeselectcode already e.g. codebox.enter.selectarbitraryElt.each...code but that didnt work.p  pOf course, I could just loop through my data, mark the text, and then use d3 to apply the other attributes I want, but that sort of defeats the point of using d3.p  pIs it possible to do this with d3 in an elegant wayp  pEDITp  pI realized I completely misunderstood how markText works, and thus the context of my question is invalid. However, Im still curious if its possible to create elements using an arbitrary function instead of append.p

Negative 353 pI have a problem I need to write some objects that are in json format in a file, but in such a way that it would eventually result a valid json. Now it would be simple to make an array with them and then encode them, strongbutstrong the problem is that I get each element in a different .php page when some event is dispatched, and I need to pass them all to a single strongvalidstrong json.br Does anyone have any idea how would this be donep  hr  pEditbr What I have is a Facebook app and I get user data and write it to a json file, however for most of the users data, I need to request permissions. Also, each of the .php pages is for one type of data one for groups, one for posting photos etc and the user can choose what data heshe wants to be written in the json. Its not a good idea to ask for strongallstrong permissions when entering the app, because users are likely to cancel entering apps that request many permissions. Instead, each time the user chooses to add some more data to the json, I will ask for the perms for that type of data.br At the end, when the user clicks a button I will write all the data to the json. I write everything with codejsonencodecodep  hr  pEdit2 An approach Ive been thinking of is to write all the data to the json, open it for reading, change all code][code to code,code and write back to the json. However, that might be an inefficient approach, since my file will be on a cloud, and opening and closing the file might cost some timep

Negative 353 pI am writing an HTML5 page using the canvas element that will allow users to scroll a large image with their finger using the touch API.  I want to prevent the user from being able to scroll beyond the right and bottom edge of the image.  In other words, I want the scrolling to stop when the user reaches the right or bottom edge of the image.  I have worked out the calculations for doing this and have it working the way I want using a regular web browser.  The problem I am having is that on iOS, large images are being scaled down automatically by the operating system using pixel sampling, and this automatic scaling is interfering with my ability to know the boundaries of the scaled down image.  What I need is a reliable way to know what the true dimensions of the image is, regardless of whether iOS has scaled it down or not.  So far I have been unable to find this out.  Can anyone help me with how to determine this  I dont really care that iOS has scaled it down, but I need to know the dimensions of the scaled down image so I can know when to stop the user from scrolling past the edge of the image.p

Negative 353 pI have an NSTabView which has 5 tabs. Each tab contains an NSTableView which, as default, is nested in NSScrollView. This is all loaded from a xib file with autolayout turned on. Id like each table to fully occupy its respective tab. Using autolayout I select each tab and carefully setup the NSScrollView so that it snaps its top, bottom, lead, and trailing edges to superview. After I do this for the 5 tabs, Ill resize the xib to give it a test. When I cycle back through the tabs, some stay snapped to the superview and some do not. There appears to be some sort of order to this but it is beyond what I can explain. p  pWhats really frustrating is that sometime this will run okay, and sometimes it will crash because of unsatifyable constraints. For now I am using springsstruts but I like autolayout and would like to get it working. p  pI am afraid that it is the nesting of the tables inside scroll views which is causing the issues. p  pIf you lay this out your own nib, you should be able to reproduce it. p  pI am hopeful that this can be solved by adding NSLayoutConstraints at runtime, if OSX is anything like iOSs autolayout. Using IB you cannot assing constraints to anythign other than super and sibling no cousins. This can be done at runtime. p  pI am hoping someone out there has encountered this issue and has a solution.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuwuCm.png altenter image description herep

The chapter is  slightly unclear about what is actually getting rendered out to the texture render target. Am I supposed to render a normal map or a height map In the text it suggests that normals are getting rendered to the target as an rgb color but then again, images b and d under section 1.3 Authoring seem to indicate that a grayscale height map should be rendered to the texture target. The chapter also talks about using a lookup texture for the u coordinate of the texture, but it is unclear to me how this fits in with rendering to the texture. Are there 2 different textures to render to If anyone can help clarify how these components fit together I would very much appreciate itp

Negative 353 pSo lets take the usual Order example. Assuming a rich domain model we have an Order.place call. It seems the way to do additional tasks related to this action these days point to domain events. So lets say this call fires an OrderPlaced event.  The usual thing that happens after the event is placed is that we send a confirmation email so we create an event listener for this event, and send an email.p  pSo simply Order.place  OrderPlaced event raised  EmailForOrderPlaced listener fires  Email gets sentp  pWe also have registration that works in a similar way  User.register  UserRegistered event raised  Registration listener fires  Email gets sentp  pHoweverp  pThe problem a made up task  doesnt have to make sense  however lot of real business requirements dont anywayp  pNow we want to offer registration  order functionality in one, and opposed to the regular one email per registration  one email for the order, we only want ot send one email that contains both. This is an aggergated concern so normally we would create a domain service that does this, however if we call User.register Order.place now it will fire the 2 events as it would normally, spamming the customer with emails ok, not really, but this is an examplep  pSo how do we get around this Obviously sending the combined email is not a problem because we can raise an event for that in the service, but that still leaves us with the original 2 emails. If I detach the 2 listeners in the service before I execute the 2 calls, that would actually mean that I have to know about their functionality and every time a new one gets added I have to go back to the service detach that one as well, etc, is there a better way that would seamlessly do thisp

Negative 353 pSince I got my previous question about arrayoutofbounds error resolves but downvoted no hard feelings D but it was my first question so you should expect some mistakes. Anyway i gonna try one more time with a new question. It is a projectexercise that I had on my exams for Programming II lab lesson. Firstly it requires a class called Point which describes a point in 2d space with x and y coordinates piece of cake. p  pMorever, it requires a class called Line a line in general consists of 2 points in 2d space does this mean necessarily that class Line inherits class Point and describes a line in 2d space with 2 points piece of cake also. In addition, it requires a method called void MoveLinePoint, Point which will move the line and here starts the stuck D. p  pFinally it requires creating a main class with 3 objects A, B, C as Points using the 2 constructors in class Point and then print the info of  Point B on screen. After that it requires creating 2 objects D, E as Lines and initializing Line D with 0 values and Line E with Points A and B. To continue with, it requires to print Line Es info on screen so far so good but then it wants us to move the Line E in a way that it crosses Point 1,1 which will be point c. And here is my problem lying. At the end it wants us to print the new info of Line E on screen. Could you point me in the right direction Thanksp  pBelow is the full code I created so far, in order to avoid confusions like the ones in my previous question.p  precodepublic class Point      protected double x     protected double y      public Point          First constructorno arguments           public Pointdouble x1, double y1          Second constructor2 arguments         x  x1         y  y1           public void setXint x1          x  x1           public double getX          return x           public void setYint y1          y  y1           public double getY          return y           public String toString          return x,y       codepre  pClass Linep  precodepublic class Line extends Point     private Point pStart     private Point pEnd      public Line          First constructorno arguments           public LinePoint p1, Point p2          Second constructor2 arguments         pStart  p1         pEnd  p2           public void setStartPointPoint p1          pStart  p1           public Point getStartPoint          return pStart           public void setEndPointPoint p2          pEnd  p2           public Point getEndPoint          return pEnd           public String toString          return Lines start point pStart.toStringtLines end point    pEnd.toString           public void MoveLinePoint p, Point mp          My problem D          p.x  mp.x         p.y  mp.y       codepre  pThe main classp  precodepublic class TestProgram      public static void mainString[] args          Point A  new Point         Point B  new Point4,5         Point C  new Point1,1         Point zeroStartPoint  new Point0,0         Point zeroEndPoint  new Point0,0          A.setX8         A.setY13          System.out.printlnPoint B B.toString          Line D  new Line         Line E  new LineA,B          D.setStartPointzeroStartPoint         D.setEndPointzeroEndPoint          System.out.printlnLine E nE.toString           MoveLineE.pStart,   WTF my problem no.2          System.out.printlnLine E nE.toString           As you can see my problem is more about logic             and less about programming.

Negative 353 pI know codeMPISendcode is a blocking call ,which waits until it is safe to modify the application buffer for reuse. For making the send call synchronousthere should be a handshake with the receiver , we need to use codeMPISsendcode . I want to know the difference between the two. Suppose i need to send fix amount of Bytes among the processes , which one is supposed to take longer time br With me the code works well the MPISend call but waiting indefinitely for MPISsend. What could be the possible reasons p  pAnd the most important thing is , i am pretty sure the data is being received at the receiving process when using codeMPISendcode ,so this inference leads nothing in favor to wait for the handshake when using codeMPISsendcode .p  pOr i can make a conclusion  with codeMPISendcode you can send data to the self process but cant using codeMPISsendcode p

Negative 353 pI have a Netbeans java web app running on EBS with a connection to a RDS database. As adding the MySQL jarfile to the libraries folder wasnt enough, I have created a lib folder in WEBINF, hoping that Class.forNamecom.mysql.jdbc.Driver would work with jar available in that folder. This didnt work. I use the oldfashioned DriverManager class to create the connection just to see if it works before trying to use a DataSource.p  pHow can I make the MySQL ConnectorJ driver work when deployed to EBS instancep

Negative 353 pRecently I participated in a web project which has a huge large of images to handle and display on web page, we know that the width and height of images end users uploaded cannot be control easily and then they are hard to display.

Negative 353 pWhen using a web app with a codelthtml manifestfoo.manifestgtcode tag, then Chrome automatically loads the manifest into the cache.p  pFirefox however blocks the application cache events until the user has clicked on the top bar which asks do you want to allow xyz.com to store data for offline use.p  pNow, my singlepageapplication waits upon the application cache events to initiate page load  so a Chrome user experiences normal application behaviour, but a Firefox user has to confirm the install before the white screen gets content and I dont have a way to tell this to the user.p  pNow Id remove the manifest attribute from index.php and provide a install option in the application settings whichd redirect the user to index.phpenableManifest and the server would output the manifest attribute again.p  pThis, however, is suboptimal as the user has to select the enableManifest URL in the navigation bar and change potential bookmarks.

Negative 353 pIam working on a programm which is used to upload and download files onto a FTP server. When I use it on my computer it works just fine. Connection to FTP, down and uploading works great But a friend of mine wanted to test it on his computer and noticed that the programm always caused a socket write error.

He still gets the socket write error.p  pIn other tutorials it usually worked when people shut down their windows firewall. Do I have to configure kaspersky as well How would I do thatp  pI think it is just all about port restrictions or something like that... When he uses fileZilla to access the ftp it works just fine.p  pThanks in advance p
Negative 353 pI am trying to clone a database record in the entity framework, but I am wondering how to account for ID fields in the object graph that are GUIDS which are not generated by SQL server. p  pI have tried a method I found here on stack overflow but the IDs were integers and didnt fit my use case I got an exception when I tried it. I know that setting store generated pattern to Identity in the entity designer should in theory generate the GUID, but that option ends up giving me GUIDs that are all zeros. When I try to insert a second record, I get an exception regarding duplicate IDs.p  pWhat would be the best way to go about this p

Negative 353 pDuring the early days of windows mobile phones, pre exchange server capabilities on mobile devices, and before gmail became what it is today there was an app which for the life of me I can not remember the name. It provided PUSH notifications for email users by sending an sms to the device, which their application intercepted before it went to the messaging app, this sms was composed of a certain line of code that told the email software on the phone to poll the email server for new email. Of course this software also stopped the sms from actually reaching the text messaging application so as not to confuse the user. p  pNow let me put this into context. I am trying to create a note taking app for android devices that will allow one person to create a note that will then be automatically synced with other selected devices, such as family members, certain coworkers etc. I want this to sync automatically, and quietly, and the prerequisite is that I do not want to have to set up a central server to handle the passthrough. p  pI had thought back to the app from the early 2000s that I spoke of a moment ago, in thoughts that the user could just add certain contacts and their numbers into a group, write a note, then the application would send an SMS to each of the contacts that would be intercepted by the note app on their phones due to the specific header in the SMS. The message would be blocked from reaching the messaging app. But would then initiate a file transfer in the background from the initiator to all of the client phones. p  pThis is a circumstance that Ive found very hard to search for. p  pIs there any known api that could facilitate this  Or do any of you know a better method Will Google cloud messaging allow this to happenp  pThe file itself could be theoretically sent in the message, or the message could initiate a P2P connection. Either way doesnt matter to me. p  pI appreciate it in advance. p

Negative 353 pI am building a mobile website with jQuery Mobile and am setting up a link to a separate page with a pretty heavy AJAX call. As near as I can tell, because jQuerys Mobiles default link behavior discussed here a hrefhttpdemos.jquerymobile.com1.2.1docspagespagelinks.html relnofollowjQuery Mobile Docs  Linking Pagesa makes every link into an AJAX request, it is interfering with the AJAX call being made on codedocument.readycode on the page being linked to. By adding the attribute codedataajaxfalsecode to my anchor tag linking to that page, this AJAX error disappears and the new page loads and operates normally.p  pBut those transitions jQuery Mobile offers, esp. fade, are running on every other page transition and, apart from sitewide consistency, look pretty slick. Id like to be able to have this transition when I go to this page that now has codedataajaxfalsecode in its links attribute, but that appears to cancel out the transition effect  if I add an additional attribute like codedatatransitionfadecode in the anchor tag, that, perhaps understandably, wont work since I also have that codedataajaxfalsecodeattribute. Ive also tried to add something likep  precodedocument.bindmobileinit, function           .mobile.defaultDialogTransition  fade      codepre  pto the linking page, without success.p  pAm I hosed Is there any other way I otherwise cant discover that forces the clicked link to run a jQM transition Thanks for your attention.p

Negative 353 pIm thinking about new software design patterns in my plans for new projects. I would like to create a grails api project wich abstracts the access to the database layer with the buildin rest api capabilities. p  pThe target is to have a middleware wich acts only as an api and some other applications frontend, mobile frontend, apps... that use this REST API. p  p1 I ask myself wether i could get problems or a more complicated development environment with this pattern p  p2 Whats about validation Does this work without problems with the REST API features from grails i need to show the users the errors p  p3 Is there a possibility to create REST clients in my app projects wich act like domain class objects So everyone could work with grails also plugins as it would be a normal grails project. p  p4 Are there any problems known with this patternp  pI would be fine if you share your experience with this  Best regards from germany, Patrickp

Negative 353 pIts probably way too early for me to ask this, since Im totally new to programming altogether, but here goes.p  pUsing the Fixed Tabs  Swipe navigation for 2 tabs on the main activity of a new project in Eclipse Kepler, how could one make it that when launched, the app will be on a 3rd tab that is basically the 2 tabs being simultaneously activate, incorporating the items of both tabs in one listp  pThe idea is to have each tab be a category of a grid of items, that can be combined in this merged tab, then one can swipe from right to left to select one tab with one category, swipe again to switch to the next category, then swipe a 3rd time in the same direction to return to the screen with both merged and basically have a loop like that when swiping in that one direction.p  pThe swiping between tabs is only meant to occur in one direction, while a swipe in the other, will bring up a set of options instead.p  pThe items themselves will also be further subdivided on each page in expandable lists, which will be identical in both tabs, allowing them to merge.p  pThe merged tab would also have title text that overlays the 2 category tabs and indicates their combined state.p  pHere is my code in MainActivity.java so far, where I kind of want section 1 to be a combination of section 2 and 3p  precodeimport java.util.Locale  import android.app.ActionBar import android.app.FragmentTransaction import android.os.Bundle import android.support.v4.app.Fragment import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity import android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager import android.support.v4.app.FragmentPagerAdapter import android.support.v4.app.NavUtils import android.support.v4.view.ViewPager import android.view.Gravity import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.TextView  public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity implements         ActionBar.TabListener              The link android.support.v4.view.PagerAdapter that will provide       fragments for each of the sections.

Negative 353 pI have looked a couple of question on stack overflow. Many questions seems to be close to what I am asking, but I cant find my answer throughout them. So here I am asking a brand new question.p  pPlease feel free to ask me for more info if I omitted something important.p  h2Contexth2  pI am building a Symfony2 Web application that manages some users avalability to some events on a calendar. So I have 3 entities to represent that. Utilisateur that means user which is an extension of FOSUserBundle, Evenement which means event and an intermediary object that stores status of the relation between those last two. The intermediate entity name is Disponibilite which means availability.p  h2What I want to doh2  pWhen a user clicks on an event on the calendar, it brings him to a page where he can specify if he is available or not from a dropdown list and then write a brief comment to motivate his decision. He then submits his availability and the server saves his availability for the event.p  h2Problemh2  pIn my form for submiting my availability, I cant seem to find a way to inject information about the related objects Evenement and Utilisateur. I dont want to make an entity choice field since the User and Event are already chosen. I want to make a sort of hidden entity field.

This is because it requires an Authorize Bearer header, which the access token isnt available from outside the web application.li liThere is a token endpoint that we can use to request a token from outside the app, but using the builtin token endpoint requires the users username and password as plain text to be sent.li ul  pI guess all the work needs to be done from an external trusted client application which must have access to the same database that stores user info.

Will the code[Authorize]code attribute still block access because the user would technically not be logged in Or does code[Authorize]code actually log the user in if it doesnt result in a 401p

Negative 353 pI have a Windows Forms application which is consuming an OAUTH service. In order to authenticate, I use a Web Browser control to navigate to the services login page.  The user enters username and password, and this works well.p  pNext, the service displays a Grant access page. When the user clicks Grant access, the page redirects to a URL of my choice, passing the authentication token in the query string.p  pThis worked well on the Windows 7 machine  that I developed on. I capture the query string in the Navigating event, hide the web browser control, and can then use the service by using the token I received. But on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the Navigating event never happens. Instead, the Web Browser control displays a 404 error.p  pIs there some way that I can capture the results of that  redirectp  pP.S. I tried using an HttpListener, and it worked, but it requires that the application be installed by an Administrator to set up the http bindings.p

Negative 353 pI am porting my iOS game to Android using Apportable and just ran into an issue with Crittercism that I havent been able to solve.p  pFirst of all I noticed that the Apportable SDK comes with an old version of Crittercism embedded 3.0.2, that version is really old and I would rather not use it. Also it was impossible for me to link against it previously because whenever I tried to write a wrapper for it the java compiler would complain that the Crittercism package didnt exist that has been fixed in the latest Apportable SDK version 1.1.06.p  pWhat I ended up doing is writing a dummy jar which I used to replace the embedded Crittercism jar in the SDK folder, then linked against the newest Crittercism jar from their website and wrote a simple wrapper to pass the application context to it. This results in Crittercism initializing properly and reporting app loads properly but it fails to report crashes.p  pUsing the new Apportable SDK I have tried the old embedded version of Crittercism to no avail, the same problem persists, app loads are reported properly but app crashes are not reported at all. I also found a hrefhttpsupport.crittercism.comcustomerportalarticles662549icanseeapploadsbutnocrasheswhatisgoingwrong relnofollowthis articlea in the Crittercism website that explains that the library wont report crashes if theres anything else catching exceptions before it does.p  pSo here are my questionsp  pWhy is there an embedded Crittecism jar in the apportable SDKbr Is there a better way to use Crittercism with my Apportable appbr Can I use the newest Crittercism library with Apportablebr Is there anything else catching exceptions in the Apportable runtimebr If Crittercism wont work with my app, are there any other working optionsp  pThank you in advance.p
Negative 353 pI need to send a continuous flow of messages simple TextMessages with a timestamp and xy coordinates over a wireless network from a moving computer. There will be a lot of these short messages like 200 per sec and unfortunately the network connection is most likely unreliable since the sending device will leave the WLAN area from time to time... When the connection is not available, all upcoming messages should be buffered until the connection is back up again. The order of the transmitted messages does not matter, since they contain a timestamp, but ALL messages must be transferred.p  pWhat would be a simple but reliable method for sending these telegrams Would it be possible to just use a plain TCP or UDP socket connection Would messages be buffered when the connection is temporarily down and send afterwards automatically Or is the connection loss directly detected and reported, thus I could buffer the messages and try to reconnect periodically on my own Do libraries like Netty help herep  pI also thought about using a broker to broker communication e.g. ActiveMQ network of brokers as an alternative. Would the overhead too big here Would you suggest another messaging middleware in this casep

I want to create something like the diffpatch Unix functionality, but with Java, for files that are directly in a FS, that is, outside a repository. p  pAt the moment, I could easily get a Diff with JGit by using the following codep  precodepublic static EditList computeDifferencesGitfinal File pfileOld,                                              final File pfileNew throws IOException      RawText lcontentFileOld  new RawTextpfileOld     RawText lcontentFileNew  new RawTextpfileNew      EditList llistDiffs  new EditList     llistDiffs.addAllnew HistogramDiff.diffRawTextComparator.DEFAULT, lcontentFileOld, lcontentFileNew      String lstrUnidiff  getUnidifflcontentFileOld, lcontentFileNew, llistDiffs     System.out.printlnUNIDIFFn  lstrUnidiff      return llistDiffs  codepre  pHowever, I would like to apply the results of that diff to a third file as a patch.p  pI investigated and found there is an codeApplyCommandcode class in JGit package.

Negative 353 pIve got a screen which involves a movieclip where the object has a outline to symbolize that it can be clicked. Upon clicking the object, Im requesting it to do numerous functions, disable itself and then go to another frame which removes the outline symbolizing it cannot be clicked anymore.

Negative 353 pUsing SQL, I want to create a kind of histogram. The data itself is already organized in a way, that makes creating the histogram easy and straight forward. The simplified query basically looks likep  precodeSELECT rank, COUNT AS count FROM ranks GROUP BY rank ORDER BY rank codepre  pWhich gives me a table like the followingp  precode  rank  count    0     20      1     15      2     9       6     3       9     2       codepre  pThe problem For further processing of the data, I require the zerobins to be given explicitly. In this case knowing that my ranks go from 0 to 9, I need a table with ten rows e.g. rank 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 would have a count 0 explicitly stated in the table.p  pI thought about creating a temporary table with the ranks as values and joining my query to that table, but that does not seem particularly elegant. Is there a nicer way avoiding complicated procedures.p

Negative 353 pI have tried using Static variable for the ArrayList but in the ListFragment class, while debugging its value is null.p  pI think the ListFragment gets created before initialising the ArrayList, thats why its null, but not sure.p  pSuggest if i can use any other way to send the inflated ArrayList from Fragment class to other Fragment class which extends ListFragment.p  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongObjective This is the clue, what needs to be donestrongp  pIn the Mondayfragments onStart method use the findByView method to find the label for the save entry button in the pages view. Using the reference to the button attach a setOnClickListener method to the save button. You will need to save the time and the diary entry strings contained in the EditText fields on the page in this method.p  pUse findViewById to also get a reference to the first EditText field and use this to get the text of the field as a string and save it to a string. Repeat this for the next EditText  the diary entry. You will need a publicly accessible variable to store a reference for the day Monday..Friday, the date time string, and the diary entry string. Create a new class diaryLogs with these fields to hold the values and a single constructor that takes an int 0 Mon, 1 Tue, 2 Wed etc and two strings for the date time and diary entry to initialise an instance of the object. As a number of entries will be made for the same day, use an ArrayList lt diaryLogs  to store the values. As this value will be shared between fragments declare the variable as static in the MainActivity class. Use the .add method of ArrayList to add the new diaryLog to the ArrayList in your setOnClickListener method. Repeat this operation for the other diary page fragments.p  pThe mondaylist fragment consists of a ListView and a button used to return to the Mondayfragment page. Create these objects in the mondaylist xml file. Create a Mondaylistfragment that extends the ListFragment class. In the onCreateView method inflate the mondaylist resource.p  pIn the onCreate method you need to provide a single array of strings as the source for the list in the setListAdapter method used to fill the ListView on the page. The strings are in your static ListArray variable in MainActivity. However, they are not in the form required and you must unpack the diaryLog elements to get to the required strings. To do this you must create a String array big enough to hold the strings to display. As this consistes of a datetime string followed by a diary entry string there will be two such strings for each diaryLog element. Use a Iterator to iterate through your ListArray. Copy the date string and diary string strings into your local string. Then use this local string as the relevant parameter of setListAdapter so that the ListView displays the required strings.p  pAdd the click handler in the MainActivity java file so that a click on the Save Diary Entries button in the Monday fragment page causes the Mondaylistfragment to be made visible using the FragmentManager. Also add a click handler in MainActivity so that a click on the Return to Monday Diary button returns to the Mondayfragment page.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong strongClass MainActivitystrongp  precodepublic

I use sockets but if i send more packets in the same time then my server cant read all.p  pSo i wrote a code to read every single byte inputstream.read and if a specific byte was read, the byte array should proceed. I have the problem, that i have no such byte to send that my read function knows that the packet is finished to proceed.p  pI would use byte number 254 2 but i dont know if that is ok and makes no problems. Has anybody an idea which byte i can securely usep

To make sure the WordMaster property was indeed null, I ran this for loop, which successfully shows the value IsNull when I inspect in the debugger.p  precodeforeachvar word in db.Words      var str  word.WordMaster  null  IsNull  NotNull  codepre  pIs there anything dumb Im missing herep  pEditp  pI think Ive found the key difference between the WordMaster and the Category property.  Im using Entity Framework, so both tie are automatically generated by the respective foreign keys MasterId and CatId.  In the database and the generated model, MasterId is a NOT NULL int, whereas CatId is a nullable.  MasterId still has some entries with a default id that doesnt point to a real Word  these show up nullable in the inspector looking at db.Words, but apparently not in the LINQ query.  Whereas CatId is actually null, and its Category property correctly shows up as null.  p

Negative 353 pthanks for reading. p  pI have a strange problem. I am running Angular and Jade together  on a node server  and have implemented popcorn.js  an html5 media framework, popcornjs.com . p  pThere is an event property on Popcorn called currentTime, so when you call Popcorn.currentTime, it gives you the current time of the video that it is playing. This functionality is working in a console.logPopcorn.currentTime but for some reason when I try to get that same value out of the function, I get a value of 9.p  pIll list my Angular Controller, and my Jade Code. My question lies in the Show current time section   p  pHere is my Angular Controller  p  precode  angular.moduleapp.controllermvEditCtrl, function scope,     mvNotifier,mvIdentity,location    scope.identity  mvIdentity     scope.videoID  location.search.id     This custom directive holds the loading of the Popcorn video to avoid race condition.    .directivepopcornVideo, [timeout, function timer      return          scope false,         link function scope            timerfunction               var video  Popcorn.smart              video,              scope.videoID              gtgtShow current time.              scope.theTime  setIntervalfunction                 video.currentTime               console.logvideo.currentTime               var time  video.currentTime               return time             ,1000            , 0               ] codepre  pAnd here is my Jade Code  see where I call theTime . Its worth noting I have tried to use ngbind here as well with the same reusult in the Dom  9  . p  precode.panel.panelprimary .panelheading.textcenter Video Preview .panelbody         .popcornVideopopcornvideo             videocontrols             footnotediv .panel.panelprimary     .panelheading.text.center Video Controls     .panelbody.textcenter Video Timer   theTime    codepre  pSO in recap, theTime is rendering on the page as 9, and console.log is showing the current video time  234 etc... p  pThanks very muchp
Negative 353 pI have been working on a Raspberry Pi powered photobooth that is controlled via a web interface on a users smartphone as my first RPi project.p  pThe booth itself has a built in display that has a pygame view to give an animated guide and countdown when taking pictures. It uses flasksocketio a hrefhttpflasksocketio.readthedocs.orgenlatest relnofollowhttpflasksocketio.readthedocs.orgenlatesta to handle client connections and input events from the user via the smartphone.p  pPygame needs to be on the apps main thread, and so does socketio, so my problem is that I cant get socketio to work if displaying the pygame view.p  pMy original logic was to have socketio events create an event like sop  precodesocketio.onconnect, namespacephoto def clientconnect     evnt  pygame.event.Eventgui.INFOEVENT, msgclientconnect     pygame.event.postevnt codepre  pand then catch this event in the pygame threadp  precoderunning  True while running     for event in pygame.event.get         if event.type is gui.INFOEVENT and event.msg  clientconnect             welcome client on photobooth screen and start guide codepre  pNote I havent checked the syntax on this and it might be wrong.p  pDoes anyone know how I might achieve this And if so, is my logic halfway therep  pI am struggling to get my head around threads and queues and whilst I have learned a tonne, this fun project is slowly wearing me down Very grateful for any help.p  pAndrewp
Negative 353 pMy Rails 4.0 app is able to charge a payment successfully when running on localhost, but the same app deployed to Heroku fails.  My Stripe logs say that the card field is empty.

Negative 353 pI have about 3000 entries in a column in SQL 2012 which are unstructured at the moment iep  p1.1.01.10, 1.1.1.11 p  pI want to get the data into a format which includes a leading 0 for all single numbers i.e.p  p01.01.01.10 and so on. p  pis there any way of doing this with an update query I can do this by exporting to excel and manipulating there but I want to avoid this if possible.p
Negative 353 pIm developing a crazy idea I had. Basically trying to keep the code as compact as possible I came up with thisp  precodefunction swordAtk       gets two attack dice  rolls     var rolls  2, i0     var d6  Math.floorMath.random6  1     var d6res  0      while i lt rolls          d6res  d6         d6res  d6res         i          attack.htmlYou attack for   d6res  .  codepre  pThis works perfectly to show the result of two rolls added up, however I want to check the results of each roll against each other to see if they are the same. If they are the same, a bonus die is rolled. p  pI could separate each roll out into different variables, but if theres a way to do it inside this compact loop Id rather do that.p

Negative 353 pWe recently upgraded from MSSQL 2005 to MSSQL 2008 and after doing so, we are having an issue, 4 out of 10 procedures that we have set up to output XML files arent working.

Negative 353 pI apologize if this question has been asked, Im having trouble putting it into words.p  pIve been asked to filter out rows in a query where text from one field is contained in another field. An example would probably explain it betterp  precode    Column1         Column2     Low Static       Static     Static           Static     Static           Clear                      Static     Very Low Freq    Freq codepre  pThe result of the query should return only rows 3 and 4, since rows 1, 2, and 5 contain strings that are similar. Right now, I have the following conditionp  precode    WHERE     Column2 NOT LIKE   Column1       OR Column1 NOT LIKE   Column2   OR Column1 IS NULL codepre  pHowever, its returning rows 1, 3, 4, and 5 when I want to only return rows 3 and 4. This is just example data, my actual dataset contains many different text strings in columns 1 and 2, so I cant just write specific case statements to exlcude certain instances where the columns are similar.p  pMaybe this just isnt possible, since Im unable to define a string as something contained within 2 spaces, while at the same time taking into consideration cases where there are no spacesp  pThanksp
Negative 353 pWe have an Angular.js app with UI Router. On any modern browser, our app is pretty fast. However, on one of our target devices, the view change is just way too slow mostly because its executing JS horribly at the moment  thats a sideissue that were fixing. p  pThe main problem were seeing is that we have a mouse event that kicks off the view change via a location.path change, and its running at 250ms  400ms.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoLOD6.jpg altscreen cap of offending mouse eventp  pWeve tried tons of things, like abandoning the Hammer events were using to call the code, stripping down the app so that only a blank view is loaded, removing all of the XHR calls we had, removing DOM manipulation, and host of other little experiments.p  pThe jQuery event being called is jQuery.event.add specifically line 4305 of jQuery 1.11.1.p  pWhat were hoping is that someone has experienced a similar problem and can help diagnose what would trigger the plethora of Remove Timer events, GC Events, Parse HTML, Request Animation Frames, Install Timers, and Recalculate Styles. Each of them appears to be in the microseconds or at most lt 2 milliseconds, and the cumulative total is nowhere near the hundreds of milliseconds were seeing.p
Negative 353 pWhile attempting to make an image wall of sorts, with differing sizes of images, its proven difficult to leave no gaps.p  pIdeally, larger images should push images to both sides, not allowing any gaps to form on the left, which seems to happen at the moment.p  pExamples, that I have created, exist here a hrefhttpcodepen.ioSmashmanpenLbydF relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioSmashmanpenLbydFap  precode.flex   display flex   flexwrap wrap   alignitems flexstart  .float   amp .item     float left  .column   columncount3   columngap0 codepre  pFlex, Float and Column are the attempts shown here and so far, float is the closest.p  pFlex doesnt allow the same area to be occupied if already pushed down and column completely reorders the content and resizes elements at will.p  pIn this example, 4 would, ideally, be directly below 1 and then 5 is below 3. This would allow the wall to exist without gaps.p  pIf someone could help me, I greatly would appreciate it.p  pThank you.p

I dont have enough experience yet to know what kinds of things will cause a SQL server to have slow downs like this.p  hr  pI have a problem that seems weird to me. Two things that seem unrelated have correlated twice now. p  pFirst, I have a stored procedure in strongemSQL Server 2008 Express R2emstrong that is wrapped in a transaction code below. Inside the transaction, p  ul lirecords older than a certain date are being copied from a log table into a log archive table. li lithen the records are deleted from the log table. li ul  pThe database is on a dedicated hosting server.p  pSecond, I have a website page that loads three strongemHTMLemstrong tables via strongemAJAXemstrong. The code behind is reading from the same database that the Log tables are on, but none of the DB tables overlap. The queries are executed via strongemLINQtoEntitiesemstrong using strongemEntity Frameworkemstrong 6. They are somewhat complex queries, but under normal circumstances, each of the HTML tables take less than 5 seconds to load once the strongemAJAXemstrong call is kicked off. The website is on a shared hosting server. p  pstrongNO OTHER QUERIES ON THE SITE ARE SLOW.

I had to open the timeout window to 180 seconds for them to even have a chance to load before timeout.p  pThe only way I am able to get the queries back to normal speed is to STOP the strongemSQL Server serviceemstrong, and START it again.

Negative 353 pI am using a Flot graph and I am setting up various interactive elements. One of these elements is one in which the user inputs any x value It really could be either an x or y value depending on the situation, but for simplicity, lets assume it is always an xaxis value and I need to output the corresponding y coordinate on the line I have graphed.  I feel like this should be kind of simple, so I apologize if the answer is an obvious one.  Note that the input value is probably not going to be a point in the array which flot is using to create the line although it could.p  pYou could also imagine a vertical line at x  [user input, not necessarily a whole number] intersecting another line series at some point.  I would need to find the point of intersection.  I tried uploading a photo, but I dont have enough reputation points.p

Negative 353 pI am building a site for a client in Drupal 7.  Unfortunately I have to be careful here about what I say due to nondisclosure agreement so apologies for the vagueness...p  pWe make use of externally provided paidfor content in iframes throughout the site.p  pSome of this content are links, which when clicked open a new page in our site, dynamically filling this page with information, within another iframe.  Lets call this page the Company Data page, and each time its loaded it shows data from a specific company.p  pMy client now wants forums on the site, and threads which are specific to each of those companies. He wants these threads linked to from the Company Data page.p  pSo I have the following questionsp  ol lipis it possible to dynamically create a new forum thread for each company  This could be done and probably should ONLY be done when someone first clicks a link for that particular company.  I guess this means that when someone first clicks on Company As link, a forum thread is created for Company A, as well as the user being taken to the Company Data page for Company A.pli lipis it then possible to have a link to that forum or a block with the forum thread appear on the dynamically created Company Data pagepli ol  pIm totally stuck on this onep

Negative 353 pTo briefly explain my problem, an SMS gateway connects to my PHP script using a GET request and the message contents are extracted and saved to a MySQL database. The message content includes a timestamp value and this value is saved within the same table. There is only one table used and the columns are ID int, sender int, message varchar, timestamp timestamp.p  pThe SMS gateway receives messages from approximately 100 different numbers and the maximum number of messages that will be received from each number is 400 each day, although they do not send messages every day. Over the course of the month, the script will probably be saving up to 300,000 messages.p  pI had to create a browserbased report that generates a table containing a row for each number and then the daily totals for the number of messages received from that number, so the first column in the table shows the number, the second column shows the total number of messages received on the 1st August, the third column shows the total number of messages received on the 2nd August, etc.p  pThe script itself works fine but timesout because of the number of totals that need to be retrieved. Ive implemented the queries in the following two ways but neither completes within the maximum script execution time of 60 secondsp  ol lipRetrieve a distinct list of the numbers in the database, then loop through the list of numbers and run up to 31 queries for each number to retrieve the daily totals using a COUNT statement.pli lipRetrieve a distinct list of the numbers in the database, then loop through the list of numbers and run a single query to retrieve the timestamp values for every message received within the month. Once the list of timestamp values has been retrieved, the results are looped through and the date part of the timestamp extracted and an array updated  the array key is the day of the month and the value is the total of messages received in that month. When the timestamp value matches the day the array value is incremented by one.pli ol  pNeither of these solutions seems ideal because the first solution has to run too many separate queries and the second solution retrieves a significant amount of data which also has to be processed.p  pApproaches that Im considering at this stage are to either look at adding some kind of GROUP BY clause or extracting just the date part of the timestamp, saving it to a separate column and then indexing that in addition to the number column which is already indexed.p  pThank you for any advice or assistance you can offer. My options as far as optimising the database are limited because I cant change the database type and I cant edit the MySQL configuration file, so I have to make sure my queries are designed correctly and the database schema is optimal.p

Negative 353 pWe have an C.Net 4.0 application which imports RSA Private Keys from a PEM file to RSACryptoServiceProvider.p  pThis application works perfectly for RSAKeys from 512 to 4096 bit, but doesnt with a special kind of rsa private keys.p  pHere you can find two example keys a hrefhttpsgist.github.comdarinkes853227100e1d1df1916d relnofollowtest keysap  pOpenSSLCommand openssl genrsa out PRIVATE.KEY 2048p  pThe main difference is the selection of the two primes p and q.

Negative 353 pSo I got excited when I found out there was a a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenbook.rrd.php relnofollowPHP RRD Librarya but unfortunately it doesnt abstract away the rrdtool options syntax like I was hoping it would.p  pWhat I want to do is treat .rrd files as a datasource in an application at best, but at the very least, be able to programatically construct options in a more humanfriendly way.  It seems like all of the bindings for various languages ultimately just take an array of options that look just like the coderrdtoolcode and friends CLI options syntax.  p  pIs there anything out there thats like a structured query language for .rrd files so I could treat .rrd as a Datasource  Or at least a library that has more finetuned methods for defining the coderrdtoolcode optionsp  pI was thinking about building one that wraps around PHPs RRD Library linked above, but didnt want to reinvent the wheel if Im missing something out there.p  pFeel free to move this or retag it since its not a specific code issue.p

Negative 353 pThis is a fairly general question, but long story short, Im trying to figure out a way to break out of a function without using return. Ive got a function built from a template, so my compiler doesnt like me using return to terminate early as Ive seen suggested before. Here is a condensed version of what Im trying to dop  precodeV amp find K key      TreeNodeltK,Vgt traverseFind     TreeNodeltK,Vgt  treeNode  new TreeNodeltK,Vgt key,NULL     traverseFind  root     unsigned int compareTraverseToHeight  0     A bunch of stuff happens     ifkeyFinder  0  this is what I have tried to do         return     return traverseFindgtvalue This is what Im working with, the value can be NULL  codepre  pSome background this is a find function within a binary tree, which contains two parameters key and value. A key is searched for, and then its corresponding value is returned. As part of the project, Ive been tasked with throwing an exception which is caught by a tester function if a key is entered which isnt in the tree. This works fine, however, the way the tester program is configured throws me right back into the function after being resolved, in which case I have traverseFindvalue  NULL, which crashes my program when I try and return it. I have no control over the tester, so Id like to break out of the find function before I have to return a value.p  pMost of this is background for the curious. My real question is instead of the ifkeyFinder 0 function that I have tried to use which doesnt compile, is there another option I can use to end the function early A break statement for functions, so to speakp  pMORE CODEp  precodeifndef CSC116BSTH define CSC116BSTH    An implementation of a binary search tree.

Negative 353 pIve got a problem which is kinda obvious, though Im not sure how to solve it.

One of the obvious solutions is to make a variable inside executeUpdate which will save the value of MyTime, BUT this is not good for the real project Im working on.p  pI was told that I might want to do something with ContextResolver and Context. Any thoughs on how do I solve this Thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrong I found one solution, though I dont think it is the bestp  precodepublic class AutoId              private static Long[] MyTime  new Long[1000]      AroundInvoke     public Object addLogInvocationContext context throws Exception          MyTime[intThread.currentThread.getId] System.currentTimeMillis             return context.proceed               public static Long MyTime     return MyTime[intThread.currentThread.getId]       codepre  pnaming array the same way as procedure allows to minimize code changes in main class only by adding  after AutoId.MyTime  AutoId.MyTimep  pThats still not the best Idea, though it doesnt cause rewriting of variable anymore.p  pstrongEDIT2strong please dont really mind all the code in executeUpdate procedure. It is just written in a way it takes some tome to finish working, so that I can execute 1 more copy of it and print out AutoId.MyTime. The value of this variable is the only thing that matters.p  pAlso its qute obvious that if I wasnt using Interceptor and just created an AutoId variable within class to call it before any other procedure thats what interceptors for that error wouldnt appear since every copy of program will have its own id easily  thats not option though. Interceptors are required for autorisation here before executing any procedure. Hope that explains everything I havent told before p

Negative 353 pI have a scenario where I am using a list box to display a large list of ViewModels, each with a visibility property that changes depending on application logic.p  pThe problem I am experiencing is that when the visibility of a virtualized item changes, the scrollbar isnt updated to reflect the scrollable range until the items are brought into view by manually scrolling.p  pThis is clearly caused by the fact that the virtualized items are not having the visibility binding evaluated and so do not add to the the scrollable range, but how can I get around the issue without disabling visualizationp  pNote  Im aware that I could use a filtering CollectionView, but having the Visibility property works better with my application logic.p  pBelow is some code that demonstrates the problem.p  precode    public class ViewModel  INotifyPropertyChanged      public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged     public string Name  get private set      public Visibility Visibility              get  return mvisibility          set                      mvisibility  value             RaisePropertyChangedVisibility                    public ViewModelstring name              Name  name           protected void RaisePropertyChangedstring property              if PropertyChanged  null                      PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgsproperty                    Visibility mvisibility  Visibility.Visible   public partial class MainWindow  Window      public ListltViewModelgt ViewModels  get private set       public MainWindow              ViewModels  new ListltViewModelgt          forint i  0 i lt 100 i                      ViewModels.Addnew ViewModelitem  i                   DataContext  this         InitializeComponent           void OnHideItemsClickobject sender, EventArgs e              for int i  30 i lt ViewModels.Count i                      ViewModels[i].Visibility  Visibility.Collapsed                    void OnShowItemsClickobject sender, EventArgs e              for int i  30 i lt ViewModels.Count i                      ViewModels[i].Visibility  Visibility.Visible                  ltDockPanelgt     ltUniformGrid Columns2 DockPanel.DockTopgt         ltButton ContentHide offscreen items ClickOnHideItemsClick gt         ltButton ContentShow offscreen items ClickOnShowItemsClick gt     ltUniformGridgt     ltListBox ItemsSourceBinding ViewModels HorizontalContentAlignmentStretchgt         ltListBox.ItemContainerStylegt             ltStyle TargetTypexType ListBoxItemgt                 ltSetter PropertyVisibility ValueBinding Visibility gt             ltStylegt         ltListBox.ItemContainerStylegt         ltListBox.ItemTemplategt             ltDataTemplategt                 ltBorder Margin1 BorderThickness1 BorderBrushGreengt                     ltTextBlock TextBinding Name Margin5 gt                 ltBordergt             ltDataTemplategt         ltListBox.ItemTemplategt     ltListBoxgt ltDockPanelgt codepre

Negative 353 pI want to render a route that consists of both DRIVING and TRANSIT TravelMode parts Legs. p  pI get the results separately, but I am unable to render them all together onto the map. As I render them one after another, the next render wipes the previously rendered route off the map.  Seems that a request can only be made with one set of parameters, and that the method to make just one route with waypoints doesnt accept legs with different TravelModes. p  pDoes anyone have ideas on how to either manipulate the response set by adding into DirectionsRoute object the route[] or leg[] arrays from other results, or to prevent the renderer to start all over at the next callp  pOr even another approachp
Negative 353 pI am using a stdlist in a multithreaded program. Elements are only added to the end of the list and only removed from the beginning of the list. There exists a writer lock to guarantee mutual exclusion for writes. Readers access the list without obtaining the lock. The readers maintain iterators which cannot be invalidated by erase as I guarantee that elements are only erased if the readers have passed them. The only possible data race I can imagine is if an element is appended, and one of the readers accesses that element before the inserter has written the element itself.p  pWith a single writer, appending insert at the end should be atomic as a single write is needed to insert the new element.p  pstdlist apparently gives no guarantees whatsoever, can somebody confirm that above usage should work without data races. If not, is there an alternative e.g. boost which gives such a guaranteep

Negative 353 pSo I have this codeQFramecode which is the parent widget represented by codethiscode in the code. In this widget, I want to place a codeQWidgetcode at 10 px from top and 10 px from bottom, as a result of which it will have a height of 140px, whereas parent is 160px. The codeQWidgetcode will have a number of custom buttons inside it in a vertical layout, in a scroll area, so that when the height of the buttons combined exceeds the codeQWidgetscode height 140px, scroll sets in automatically. Because the scroll is not for the entire parent widget, but only for a child widget, the scroll should apply only to the child widget here.

Negative 353 pIve only the .cer file now i want to convert it to .pfx file. But when i tried to convert via openssl it is asking for private key file Is it necessary to have a private key file to generate a .pfx file if not then could you please suggest the open ssl command to accomplish this. Thanks  Sushma.p
Negative 353 pI have done this before but I think they moved things around in codeconsole.developers.google.comcode so I forgot where to do it.p  pBasically, besides creating an API key and allowing the reference url, there is one more step we need to do that is not documented in codedevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascripttutorialcode in order to allow the API to work. I remember it is a place you check things like codestatic mapcode, codecanvascode etc.p

Negative 353 pWhen running an codeangularjscode application, the user access may be withdrawn from the server side.

Since angular does expect whatever it was requesting in case the access would still be given, it breaks as it may expect a json string but gets the html login page.p  pIs there anything I can do do catch this event listen to redirects, figure out whether html is returned, etc and do a hard refresh of the redirect urlp

Negative 353 pI am making a very simple website which will implement two stylesheets one for desktop users and one for mobile users.p  pWhile working on the mobile stylesheet, I have found wild inconsistencies that I cannot explain. The image below demonstrates the situation. On the left is the website viewed in Firefoxs responsive design mode. On the right is the same website viewed in Firefoxs Android mobile browser. The viewport is exactly the same in both views, I have checked and checked and triple checked. The browsers own windows resolution is the same in both the images.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coma7y3R.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, the mobile browser constantly uses some sort of scaling, that I cannot find reason for, for everything individually. The icons on the right panel of the footer are all a fixed size of 32px, and yet somehow they are scaled differently between the views. The stylesheet is the same for both views, and all the fonts are based on units of em, and yet even they are not in proportion to each other...p  pWhat is happening herep

Negative 353 pGiven the following pseudo code for calculating the distance between two closest points in the place by brute forcep  precodefor i lt 1 to n1 do     for j lt i1 to n do         d lt mind, sqrtxixj2  yiyj2 return d codepre  pThe basic operation is computing the square root. But apparently computing square roots in the loop can be avoided by ignoring the square root function and comparing the values xixj2  yiyj2 themselves.

In doing so I wanted to add a menu bar, as most programs have. However, this menu bar is rendering itself twice, once where it works and is clickable, and the second being only a ghost image that cannot be interacted with.  p  pHeres a picture of the program without me having clicked anything img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comi9wxd.png althttpi.stack.imgur.comi9wxd.pngp  pThis is after anything gets updated onscreen  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNVZWB.png althttpi.stack.imgur.comNVZWB.pngp  pThe circled File button does not work at all. The other one, however, does. Im at a loss as to why this is happening, so here is the code I used to make this small program pardon the comments, those were for my own benefitp  precodepackage painter  import java.awt.BorderLayout  import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JMenuBar import javax.swing.JPanel  SuppressWarningsserial This class will do the job of bringing together all the various sub    classes and rendering everything. public class MainPainterGUI extends JFrame      private JPanel menuPanel      private JMenuBar menuBar      These values are going to be used to set an initial window size.     private final short WINDOWHEIGHT  1000        private final short WINDOWWIDTH  1000      This constructor will do the actual creation of the window.     public MainPainterGUI              This does the same thing that setTitle does.         superPainter         setTitlePainter          This method will set what the window is supposed to do when the red x is clicked.         Technically, the value passed is an integer.         setDefaultCloseOperationEXITONCLOSE          Obviously this method sets the initial size of the window.  It can be changed by the user however.         setSizeWINDOWWIDTH,WINDOWHEIGHT          This method sets the center of the window relative to whatever is passed.

Negative 353 pThis problem appeared in a a hrefhttpcimpress.comtechchallengechallengea, but since it is now closed it should be OK to ask about it.p  pThe problem not this question itself, this is just background information can be visually described like this, borrowing their own imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com82bqi.png altcover squaresp  pI chose to solve it optimally. Thats probably for the decision variant an NPcomplete problem its certainly in NP, and it smells like an exact cover, though I havent proven that a general exact cover problem can be reduced to it, but thats fine, it only has to be fast in practice, not necessarily in the worst case. In the context of this question, Im not interested in any approximation algorithms, unless they provide cuts.p  pThere is an obvious ILP model generate all possible squares a square is possible if it covers only cells of the grid that are present, introduce a binary variable codexicode for every square indicating whether we use it or not, thenp  precodeminimize sum xi  subject to 1 xi is an integer 2 0  xi  1 3 for every cell c        sum[j  c  squarej] xj  1 codepre  pConstraint 3 says that every cell is covered exactly once. Constraints 1 and 2 make xi binary. The minimum solution gives an optimum solution to the original problem.p  pThe linear relaxation of this ie ignoring constraint 1 is halfdecent, but it does things like this this is a 6x6 grid with the top left corner missingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG7fiO.png altfractional solutionp  pHere 13 squares were chosen half giving an objective value of 6.5, of the sizes so you can find them back easierp  ul li1 of 4x4li li3 of 3x3li li6 of 2x2li li3 of 1x1li ul  pAn optimal solution for this instance has an objective value of 8, such as this onep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqCri8.png altinteger solutionp  pThe linear relaxation is halfdecent, but Im not completely happy with it. The gap is sometimes over 10, and that sometimes leads to a very slow integer phase.p  pThats where the actual question comes in, are there extra constraints that I can add lazily as cuts, to improve a fractional solutionp  pIve tried alternative formulations of the problem to find cuts, for example instead of choosing squares, what if we choose left upper corners and right lower corners, which are then to be matched up to form nonoverlapping squares that cover all cells Then on every backslashlike diagonal, there must be a matching number of leftupper and rightlower corners. But that doesnt help, because if we choose squares then that condition is always true anyway, also in fractional solutions.p  pIve also tried some reasoning about overlaps, for example if two squares overlap clearly their sum must not be bigger than 1, and that can be improved by also adding all squares wholly contained in the overlapping region. But that constraint is less powerful than the constraint that all cells be covered exactly once.p  pIve tried reasoning about the total area as in, the total covered area must be equal to the number of cells, but thats already guaranteed by the constraint that every cell must be covered once, stating it in terms of the total area only allows more freedom.p  pIve also tried to do something with square numbers the area of every square is, well, a square and differences of square numbers, but that didnt end in anything useful either.p

Negative 353 pSay you want to create a form with labels for your input, and want to make it somehow responsive by displaying as many inputs along with their labels on each line.

Source is not using any salt and using key as IV itself.p  pI have tried all options in OpenSSL however every time I am getting bad decrypt error.   Source is able to encrypt and decrypt at their end  To test my commands, I encrypted and decrypted a file on unix and able to do so  However whenver we exchange files and key, neither of us are able to decrypt the filep  pThingsCommands I have tried so farp  precodeopenssl enc d aes128ecb nosalt in ltgt out ltgt nosalt pass fileHOMEkeyfile codepre  pChanged the key into Hex and then tried belowp  precodeopenssl enc d aes128ecb nosalt K hex value iv hex value in ltgt out ltgt codepre  pI am clueless at this stage as what could be going wrong. I am assuming with the use of AES the encryptiondecryption should be independent of platform, but any pointes would be helpful if I am missing somethingp

Negative 353 pI have Virutalbox 4.3 on a Ubuntu 14.04 machine and VMWare Workstation 11 on a Windows 10 machine. I use the same Lubuntu iso to install a guest OS in both VMs, but after installation, I find they have different memory usage. When idle, the Lubuntu in VMWare takes around 250 MB of memory but the one in Virtualbox only takes around 180 MB. When I do codeps aux sort rsscode in them, I found they are not running the same processes. Also, codeps aux sort rsscode in VMWare outputs far more items than in Virtualbox. Both have roughly 70 items with nonzero VSZ and RSS, but in VMWare there are 350 items with 0 VSZ and RSS, while in Virtualbox there are only around 50 such items.  I dont understand why there is such a difference. They were installed using the same iso, shouldnt they be exactly the same The following is the output of codeps aux sort rsscode in both, with the 0 VSZ and RSS ones removed otherwise it exceeds the maximum number of chars in question.p  pThe memory usage of Lubuntu in Virtualboxp  precodeUSER       PID CPU MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND foo       1475  0.3  3.7 723448 38432

Negative 353 pI just came into a Node.js project that has a ton of unit tests, most of which, unfortunately, are outdated and dont run.
