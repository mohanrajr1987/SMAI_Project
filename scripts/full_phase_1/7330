Positive 7330 pI didnt know how to properly ask the question and for that I apologize.p  pBasically I want to know how can I set up eclipse to recognize the version of the project I am working on and how many revisions etc.p  pI had this working on CVS but for some reason on GIT I cant get it to work.p  pOn CVS I had this block of comment codep  precode   filename     Version   Id   Revisions   Log   codepre  pAnd of course it would display the file name, version and revision. With GIT it does nothing...p  pI googled as much as I could and found no answer, hopefully one of you guys can help me out. Thanksp

Positive 7330 pIm fetching myriad records from a web service and am want to store them in local DB. perhaps there maybe some duplicate records so Im checking record by record to find duplicate ones and not store them.

Positive 7330 pI have a working SVN repository CollabNet Subversion Edge 4.0.11  on Windows 2012 R2 with 62200 or so revs.  I am moving it to a Linux RedHat 6.6 CollabNet version 1.8.13 with Apache2.2.29. I understand the best way to migrate is to dump the repository. So I ran the following dump command p  precodesvnadmin dump r 162268 Fcsvndatarepositoriesrepos gt GMyDump.dump codepre  pWhen I try to dump the windows repository I get an error at revision 4255 p  blockquote   psvnadmin E200002 Serialized hash malformed.p blockquote  pNext I run just after that point another dump cause I think I can sort that out by merging the adjacent revisions into the corrupted one so I run the following commandp  precodesvnadmin dump r 425762268 Fcsvndatarepositoriesrepos gt GMy2dump.dump codepre  pThis comes up with a new error at revision 16153 that has me puzzled p  blockquote   psvnadmin E140001 zlib uncompress corrupt data Decompression of   svndiff data failedp blockquote  pThen when I run a third dump, as I am a glutton or punishment. I use the following commandp  precodesvnadmin dump r 1615462268 Fcsvndatarepositoriesrepos gt GMy3dump.dump codepre  pBut it simply hangs and seems to be doing nothing. This repository goes back 10 years and only the past 6 years is relevant. Can I somehow modify the dump to extract the past X number of years or revisions from the present that are not corrupt and load that into the new Repository So I would dump starting from the present and go backwards so to speak just a thought I dont have any good backups as those servers and tapes are gone with the last company move.

Positive 7330 pI know there have been several topics about this, but Im having difficulties with inserting and updating many to many relationships with Entity Framework 6, wrapped with a repository layer around it.p  pRemoving and adding records from a navigation property being a collection doesnt result in any changes to the database as monitored in the database log interceptorp  precodeResource newResource  resourceForAppointment.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.ResourceId  schedulerEvent.ResourceId existingAppointment.Resources.AddnewResource  Resource oldResource  resourceForAppointment.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.ResourceId  schedulerEvent.PreviousResourceId existingAppointment.Resources.RemoveoldResource  await this.Repository.UpdateAsyncexistingAppointment codepre  pReading the data works perfectly, so I doubt it has something to do with the configuration, p  precode[TableAppointment] public partial class Appointment      public Appointment                      Resources  new HashSetltResourcegt          ...      public virtual ICollectionltResourcegt Resources  get set   codepre  pHeres what I have got in the repositorys async methodp  precode public virtual async TaskltTEntitygt UpdateAsyncTEntity entity         this.Context.SetltTEntitygt.Attachentity       this.Context.Entryentity.State  EntityState.Modified       await this.SaveChangesAsync        return entity           codepre  pUpdating simple properties and 1 to 1 navigation properties is not a problem, its just the 1 to many or many to many relationships that fail.p  pFor the moment as a workaround, Im using the following code and I absolutely need to get rid of this piece of bad codingp  precode   await this.ResourcesRepository.ExecuteSqlAsyncDELETE FROM AppointmentResource WHERE AppointmentId  existingAppointment.AppointmentID AND ResourceID  schedulerEvent.PreviousResourceId    await this.ResourcesRepository.ExecuteSqlAsyncINSERT INTO AppointmentResource VALUESexistingAppointment.AppointmentID,schedulerEvent.ResourceId  codepre  pOther noteworthy remarks here include that I use Unity MVC as the bootstrapper for my repository, hereby using the PerRequestLifeTimeManager.

When creating a new Appointment, Im able to add a new record to the Resources collection, as you can see from this code excerptp  precode Map scheduler event to appointment  Appointment newAppointment  Mapper.MapltAppointmentgtschedulerEvent   Lookup resource by ID and add to new appointment       Resource resourceForAppointment  await this.ResourcesRepository.FindOneAsyncx gt x.ResourceId  schedulerEvent.ResourceId newAppointment.Resources.AddresourceForAppointment    Save to database  Appointment freshAppointment  await this.Repository.CreateAsyncnewAppointment   public virtual async TaskltTEntitygt CreateAsyncTEntity entity     this.Context.Entryentity.State  EntityState.Added    TEntity createdItem  Context.SetltTEntitygt.Addentity    await this.SaveChangesAsync     return createdItem  codepre  pI can conclude from this that the repository pattern doesnt necessarily block the onetomany or manytomany relationships, but that Im missing something else.

Positive 7330 pI would like to ask the way to implement big file extension in TortoiseHg Mercurial version 2.9, to manage the big binary files in the repository.p  pSince my project is growing, the binary files are also changing and growing in term of the file size. So, as I checkin the binary files of course including others file as well,just because the binary files cannot be merged, this post a threat to the limited size of the Mercurial repository and one day the repository will be full and probably crashed.p  pI had searched and study about the largefiles extension of Mercurial, but this is not the way that I am looking for, because the largefile extension still keep the largefile actually same as big files in the remote repository center repository, although the local repository can have a lesser space being occupied, since as long as there are the largefiles copies at the center repository, we can download it anytime we want. But, this still occupy the repository space.p  pTherefore, I am thinking of keeping all the big binary files outside of repository and each revision will have their own link to their big binary files. So, the repository just keep the link to the big binary files only, and seems that the big file extension can serve this purpose.p  pHowever, I just cant find the big file extension in the Mercurial setting. And I also look through a hrefhttpsmercurial.selenic.comwikiBigfilesExtension relnofollowhttpsmercurial.selenic.comwikiBigfilesExtensiona and follow the implementation method of big extension, by editing the .hghgrc file. But, this cannot work.p  pAny suggestion will be much appreciatedp

Positive 7330 pI have a project with a number of git submodules, one of which Ive recently updated to a newer revision. It seems that my Xcode bot still wants to point to the older revision, as seen in the Repositories section of the Edit Bot screen and by the build error I get when I try to integrate. Is there a way to update the bot to use the correct revisionp  pI see that I am able to select different branches with no problem, but there is no apparent UI to change to an arbitrary revision or even a tag.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.coml3ZZq.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coml3ZZq.png altEdit Repositoriesap  pApparently Xcode Server has a a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationXcodeConceptualXcodeServerAPIReferenceBots.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40016472CH2SW1 relnofollowRESTful APIa which has the ability to edit bots, but so far, all PATCH requests that I have made to the bots URI result in the following errorp  precode   status 400,   message the body is empty  codepre  pIve gone so far as to try poking around in Xcode Servers CouchDB, and found what I believe to be the correct document to update under the codeallbotscode view, but making changes there doesnt seem to have an effect.

Positive 7330 pI have a question on using spring cassandra repository for searching query. I have a table with one partition key and one clustering key together as composite primary key. So in the mapping layer, I create a class for PrimanyKey using PrimaryKeyClass and PrimaryKeyColumn, then use PrimaryKey for the mapping classp  pthe table is created with the following cqlp  precodeCREATE TABLE usermobile phonenum text,memberid uuid,gender text,nickname text,photo timeuuid,PRIMARY KEY phonenum, memberid codepre  pI create a class called PKUserMobile to act as primary key classp  precodePrimaryKeyClass   public class PKUserMobile implements Serializable    PrimaryKeyColumnordinal  0, type  PrimaryKeyType.PARTITIONED   private String phoneNum   PrimaryKeyColumnordinal  1, type  PrimaryKeyType.CLUSTERED   private UUID memberId ......  codepre  pand my mapping class is something like thisp  precodeTableusermobile public class UserMobile extends BaseDto    PrimaryKey  private PKUserMobile pk  ........  codepre  pand it is fine to run cql like select  from usermobile where phonenum  xxxxxxxxx . So I guess it is fine for search this table with partition key only. When I try to search using spring cassandra repository, seems it require me to provide both phonenums and memberids value for searching usage. the following exception is thrown if I only set up the value for phonenum.p  precodecom.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.InvalidQueryException Invalid null value in condition for column memberid.  codepre  pSo I wanna know if any special null object should I pass in the clustering key as a searching condition or should I do it in any other way Thank you.p

Positive 7330 pOk, so this is an edge case, I am looking to use a repository for shared edited files. The problem I am having is that, while text files, we cannot merge them due to a dumb fingerprint protection which would not allow the file to be opened if we were to merge things.p  pso we plan on treating it as a binary file.p  pOur plan is that whenever someone wanted to work on the files they would have to checkout the files to make sure no one else is going to edit the files and waste their time since they might have to redo the changes that someone else had.p  pIs there a way we can use a repository like GIT to force all files as readonly until they are checked out, or warn the user that the file is checked out and that any changes would need to be redonep  pWhat work flow would you use for something like this, I would like a more automated process instead of just asking people to checkout a file to lock it, even then the local files of people who havent checked if it were locked could be wasting their time.p

Negative 7330 pDoes anyone know of any good toolsutilities for managing codeWeb.Configcode files between different builddeployment environmentsp  pFor example, I have a WCF project that in development I dont want to enable SSL, but I do want it enabled in production.  I want different logging settings, different DB connection strings, different error handling, different file paths... Even some different Unity framework bindings wire up mocks for unit testing instead of the real objects for deployment.p  pMaintaining individual copies of the codeWeb.Configcode is a pain, because adding a new web service means editing multiple files and keeping them in sync.p  pIve also noticed that if you muck with the codeWeb.Configcode too much by hand, Visual Studio will choke if you try to use the add item wizard to, say, add a new Web Service for WCF, since it has to modify the Web.Config to add the endpoint,a nd cant parse it any more. So I have to be careful not to invalidate the existing Web.Config.p  pI also thought about just using some regex to do replacements and just building a new codeWeb.Configcode in a prebuild command.

Negative 7330 pI have a Windows executable that is launched from within a service by calling CreateProcessWithLogonW with a set of specfied user details.p  pThis works fine and the process starts as expected. However, when this process tries to launch other processes itself, currently just using CreateProcess these start then die straight away  they are executables that require desktop access.p  pAfter reading up on Microsofts article on CreateProcess  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms68242528VS.8529.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms682425VS.85.aspxap  pI think can see why this is happening and it makes sense to an extent. CreateProcess knows the calling process is impersonating a user so it uses its parent process, which in this case is the Local System account. But of course anything run in the local system account doesnt have the access we need, so the launched process dies.p  pOddly when I was previously using LogonUser and CreateProcessAsUser to launch the initial executable within the service, it worked fine. But I had to change this to CreateProcessWithLogonW due to problems with not having the correct privileges.p  pDoes anybody know of a solution to this Ive seen talk about this elsewhere on the web but not with any definite solution. It seems like I possibly need the token of the user im logging on with in CreateProcessWithLogonW with so I can use it to launch the other processes later But I have no way of getting hold of this token, can this be retreived for the current user in any wayp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks p

Negative 7330 pI tried to do several searches before posting this question. If this is a duplicate, please let me know and I will delete it.p  pMy question revolves around the proper way to handle errors produced through our web application. We currently log everything through log4j. If an error happens, it just says An error has occurred. The IT Department has been notified and will work to correct this as soon as possible right on the screen.  This tells the user nothing... but it also does not tell the developer anything either when we try to reproduce the error. We have to go to the error log folder and try finding this error. Let me also mention that the folder is full of logs from the past week. Each time there is an error, one log file is created for that user and email is sent to the IT staff assigned to work on errors. This email does not mention the log file name but it is a copy of the same error text written that is in the log file.p  pSo if Alicia has a problem at 715 with something, but there are 10 other errors that happen that same minute, I have to go through each log file trying to find hers. p  pWhat I was proposing to my fellow coworkers is adding an Error Log table into the database. This would write a record to the table for each error, record who it is for, the error, what page it happened on, etc. The bonus of this would be that we can return the primary key value from the table errorlogid and show that on the page with a message like Error Reference Id 1337 has been logged and the proper IT staff has been notified. Please keep this reference id handy for future use. When we get the email, it would tell us the id of the error for quick reference. Or if the user is persistent, they can contact us with the id and we can find the error rather quickly.p  pHow do you setup your error logging By the way, our system uses Java Servlets that connect to a SQL Server database.p

Negative 7330 pWeve got a python library that were developing. During development, Id like to use some parts of that library in testing the newer versions of it. That is, use the stable code in order to test the development code. Is there any way of doing this in pythonp  pstrongEditstrong To be more specific, weve got a library LibA that has many useful things. Also, weve got a testing library that uses LibA in order to provide some testing facilities LibT. We want to test LibA using LibT, but because LibT depends on LibA, wed rather it to use a stable version of LibA, while testing LibT because we will change LibT to work with newer LibA only once tests pass etc.. So, when running unittests, LibAdev tests will use LibT code that depends on LibAstable. p  pOne idea weve come up with is calling the stable code using RPyC on a different process, but its tricky to implement in an airtight way making sure it dies properly etc, and allowing multiple instances to execute at the same time on the same computer etc..p  pThanksp

Negative 7330 pThis may be somewhat obscure but Ive been happily using Eclipse  PerfoceP4WSAD for over a year now and have thus far been unable to figure this out myself.  I often start a build and let it run in the background while I continue to edit source files.  The problem occurs when I try to edit a file that is not checked out from perforce.  In this case, eclipse pops up a modal dialog box that forces me to choose between either canceling the build or canceling the checkout operation.  So usually I just cancel the build, check out the file, and start the build up again, but this is very time consuming.  Is it possible to get eclipse to allow checkouts during buildsp

Negative 7330 pSo Im a bit new to web services and a situation recently came up where we added an element to a datatype that gets returned to the client.  The clients complained that this broke their implementation because it choked on the new element that it did not expect.  we are providing the services via Axis2.p  pTo me this seems like a harmless change that the client should be able to handle gracefully Ive worked with some nonwebservice frameworks where adding optional information was completely acceptable.  I could understand if we deleted or renamed some fields that that would cause issues for the client.  p  pBasically I would expect the wsdl to act like an interface.  If we make a change that essentially subtypes that interface, I would expect the client to happily ignore extraneous elements.  Is this just a short coming of web services, or is there a sane way of making passive changes to the services so that new clients can get the extra data while old clients can update at their leisurep

It does not allow me to find out what objects are holding a sharedptr to my objects, which could be an improvement to the above. I guess one could create something like a TRACKTHISPTRT macro that would store the file and line for where the sharedptr instance is created.p  pAnother example would be the oldp  precodeassertcondition ampamp My descriptive text codepre  pthat allows you to put meaningful comments directly into your assert.p  pDoes anyone have any neat c tricks to collect stats, automatic stack traces, tracking of objectspointersresources, deadlockstarvation or other threading issues detection, making sure that exceptions get handled somewhere, documentation help or similar Anything goes really, whether it is something that helps prevent errors or something that helps after the fact.p  pstrongEditstrong In addition to the replies to this question, Ive received tips about a hrefhttpcode.google.compgoogleglog relnofollowgooglegloga as a logging utility.p

Negative 7330 pI have a complete in app purchase solution but am wondering if I am handling errors correctly. I handle errors using code similar to the Apple example herep  precode void failedTransaction SKPaymentTransaction transaction  if transaction.error.code  SKErrorPaymentCancelled               Optionally, display an error here.          [[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] finishTransaction transaction]  codepre  pBut my question is  WILL the storekit display relevant errors to the user unable to connect, payment declined etc OR do I need to always handle this It seems from testing that when the storekit is working OK, it does indeed handle errors itself, so I can silently dump them well, in fact we log them on another server. p  pHowever when the storekit sandbox is playing up, we get random errors that indicate a problem, and NO alerts from the storekit itself.p  pWhat do you guys do with errors Do you always alert the user or will that end up duplicating alerts that the storekit has already given.p  pThanks Rogerp

Negative 7330 pI cant seem to find a simple, concrete explanation of how to bind controls in a WinForms app to nested objects using data binding.  For examplep  precodeclass MyObject  INotifyPropertyChanged      private string Name     public string Name                get  return Name           set                        Name  value              OnPropertyChangedName                         private MyInner Inner     public MyInner Inner               get  return Inner          set                      Inner  value             OnPropertyChangedInner                     public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged     private void OnPropertyChangedstring propertyName              if PropertyChanged  null                      PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName                 class MyInner  INotifyPropertyChanged      private string SomeValue     public string SomeValue               get  return SomeValue           set                        SomeValue  value              OnPropertyChangedSomeValue                      public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged     private void OnPropertyChangedstring propertyName              if PropertyChanged  null                      PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName                codepre  pNow imagine a form with just two textboxes, the first for Name and the second for Inner.SomeValue.  Im easily able to get binding to work against Name, but Inner.SomeValue is flaky.  If I populate the object and then set up the binding, it shows Inner.SomeValue in the textbox but I cant edit it.  If I start from a fresh object without initializing Inner, I cant seem to get data to stick in Inner.SomeValue.p  pIve checked all over MSDN, all over StackOverflow, and dozens of searches with different keywords.  Everyone wants to talk about binding to databases or DataGrids, and most examples are written in XAML.p  pUpdate Ive tried Marcs full test harness and have partial success.  If I hit the all change button, I seem to be able to write back to the inner object.  However, starting with MyObject.Inner null, it doesnt know how to create an inner object.  I think for now, I can work around it by just making sure my inner references are always set to a valid object.  Still, I cant help feeling like Im missing something p
Negative 7330 pOne advantage of the datamodel is that you get the row index in a table. But I find this unnecessary, since you can access the current row element using the codevarcode attribute of hdatatable.

Negative 7330 pHere is my scenario...I have a WPF app that talks to a WCF service.  p  pThe connection string settings are in the WCF service.  The WCF service can be deployed to two different web sites, one for QA and one for PROD each with its own URI.  p  pI want my WPF app to be able to be run using QA data or PROD data.  Basically, I would pass a parameter on startup to the WPF app which would be QA or PROD.  p  pWhat I would like to do is deploy the exact same WCF service code to the QA and PROD websites with the only difference being the values of the connection strings in the respective web.config files.  p  pI would then need a way to have a factory pattern in the WPF app that would return the WCF interface proxy based on the QAPROD parameter passed in.  p  pI need to make sure in the WPF app that the WCF interface proxy is viewed as the same type in both the QA and PROD reference.  p  pAfter all this, the result would be...if a user started the WPF app and passed QA, each call to the WCF service would return QA data and if they passed PROD, each call to the WCF service would return PROD data.  p  pI could simply pass QA or PROD as a parameter to each WCF service method, but that seems crude.  Since WCF is stateless and has no constructor, I need to find a more flexible solution.p

However, when I look into addition operator, multiplication operator etc, it only mentions that, the result is a prvalue, but it doesnt say anything on what the operands are expected to be.p  pWhether does the binary operator really expects the operands to be prvalue makes a difference in the following case,p  precodeint b  2 int a  b  1 codepre  pIf b is expected to be a prvalue, there will be a lvaluetorvalue conversion here, and then it will perform prvalue  prvalue and return a prvalue, and the result prvalue is assigned to an lvalue a.p  pHowever, if b is not required to be a prvalue, it would be lvalue  prvalue and the result is a prvalue.p  pI really want to know where does the standard explicitly or implicitly mentions that the  rules for different operators I check all the operators section and only a few operators that the standards explicitly mentions whether the operands and results shall be lvalue or rvalue.

Negative 7330 pim working with an existing clientside legacy database that were converting to MySQL for online use.p  pits effectively one giant table, and no relationships exist.p  pfor each record, there are several contact points  first name, last name, title, street, city, state, zip, etc., repeated for several entities.  my initial thought was to separate each of these entities into its own table with the above mentioned columns, and use FKs to link them up with traditional joins, etc.p  pbut, after going through the entire dataset and talking with the original author, it turns out that none of these contact points will ever repeat each will be unique to each record, nor is any other information related to these contact points.p  pso  AFAICT  theres no real use for relationship tables, except possibly semantics or transparency.  the dataset isnt huge but its not small either between 50,000 and 100,000 records, so i wonder if if fact it might be more efficient to just keep the singletable structure intact and skip joins altogether.p  pis there any reason to use separate tables in a situation like thisp  ptyiap

Negative 7330 pI have a custom search engine built on Zend Search Lucene.  This program is supposed to take feeds of data from sources all across the globe in many languages currently 11.  I have followed every method I have found to ensure everything is being encoded in UTF8.  In my Lucene index, there are four fields which might include special characters, but primarily we are dealing with the title and description fields, which are failing badly at the moment.p  pOn my local machine I am running XAMPP for dev and testing.  The code is working perfectly here.  I am able to index content in English, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and others without any problems.  I can use Luke to examine the resulting index and it looks great.p  pOn the live server, which has the same code Ive tried deleting and reuploading to be sure, the resulting index fails on special characters.  i.e. Chinese and Russian dont index any of the characters.  In Spanish content, it gets cut off right where the first accented character would be.  It looks like maybe the first multibyte character just kills the storage.  But the document is still saved to the index.  Other fields without special characters save properly.p  pHere is what the code looks like simplified for examplep  precodeindex  ZendSearchLucenecreateCFINDEXLOCATION ZendSearchLuceneAnalysisAnalyzersetDefaultnew ZendSearchLuceneAnalysisAnalyzerCommonUtf8NumCaseInsensitive doc  new ZendSearchLuceneDocument docgtaddFieldZendSearchLuceneFieldTexttitle, title indexgtaddDocumentdoc indexgtcommit indexgtoptimize codepre  pAgain, this code, plus the Zend library, is the same in both environments.

Negative 7330 pstrongEDITstrong  emSee my answeremp  pI saw some interesting frameworks to build applications for mobile platforms like Android and iPhone with HTML and Javascript so you can use your current webdevelopment skills without learning a new platform language. Thats very interesting because you can write just ONE application for many platforms. Very easy to maintain.p  pBut, you cannot sell it in the App stores, so Im wondering if it is possible to use an embedded webbrowser in the application that loads an externalincluded html file.p  pI have seen that it is possible to create Android and iPhone apps with flash, thats is easy, so i want to create a simple host application that only loads content and I can use it over and over again to distribute a new app.p  pSo the question is, is it possible to create a simple app with flash that embeds a webbrowser to load a html filep  pWhen it is possible, next question is, it possible to communicate with the embedded webbrowser Also a question is, will Apple allow such application in it app storep  pI hope my question is understandable.p

Negative 7330 pWe had some x64  x86 trouble when we first deployed the Oracle.DataAccess.dll with our app on different servers with 6432 bit Windows. Now that we figured out how we can get the app to reference the correct version, I still have trouble with a .dll file that is getting in the way during deployment.p  pSituation is as follows I have one project in my solution that references Oracle.DataAccess. I set the copy local property to False, because on the server, I would like the app to use the .dll from the GAC or another folder which would be the 64bit version instead of 32bit on development machine. The dll is not added to the project bin output folder, but it is copied to the webapp bin folder. When I deploy to our testserver, it uses the dll from the bin folder instead of the dll from the Oracle installation folder on the server i.e. coracleodp.netbin4p  pWhat can I do to NOT have the dll in the bin folderp

Here is a little more detail that may explain why it wont work and maybe help someone in answering this for mep  pThe codeUILocalNotificationcode that I am setting here is an event like a calendar event that is scheduled to fire at a user selected time so when scheduling the notification I will have no idea what the user is going to be doing when the notification fires. I am using the userInfo of the notification to store data about the event that is scheduled but setting a value like inBackground as suggested wont work.  p  pI do know it will be one of two situations if the user decides they want to view the event. this all will assume the app is either in the background or foreground and NOT quit.p  p1  If it fires while the app is not being used ampamp the app is in the background and not quit, iOS will notify the user that an event has occurred and provide an option for going to the responsible app which is mine in this case. At that point assuming the user says yes take me to this cool app it will open the app from the background and call the applicationDidReceiveLocalNotification where I can get all the notification userInfo.p  p2  The user, by chance, happens to be in my application when the scheduled event takes place.  At that point the applicationDidReceiveLocalNotification method is called again where I can then get all the notification userInfo.p  pBut it is at this point that I want to know which of the two scenarios just took place 1 or 2.p  pHope this additional detail about my use of the codeUILocalNotificationcode will help in answering this question.

Negative 7330 pI have a package with several subpackages, one of them for tests named codetestscode. Since the subpackage name makes it clear that contained modules are test modules, I prefer not to pollute module names with the testname pattern nose expects to include them for testing. Thats the setup Im thinking ofp  precode foo    init.py   ...    bar      init.py     ...    baz      init.py     ...    tests      init.py      something.py codepre  pNow, by default nose does not run tests found in codefoo.tests.somethingcode. I know nose accepts the codeicode option to define regular expressions for additional stuff to search tests in. So codenose i somethingcode  does the job here. However, I have a bunch of modules in the codetestscode package and do not want to name them explicitely. codenose i tests..code does not work, it looks like nose only matches against module basenames. As a last resort I could run codenose allmodulescode, but this also inspects codefoo.barcode and codefoo.bazcode  Id like to avoid this.p  pSo, how could I instruct nose to look for tests in all modules within a given package codetestscode in my case I could write a nose plugin for this task, but Im looking for a standard solution.p

Negative 7330 pIm currently developing an OpenCLapplication for a very heterogeneous set of computers using JavaCL to be specific. In order to maximize performance I want to use a GPU if its available otherwise I want to fall back to the CPU and use SIMDinstructions. My plan is to implement the OpenCLcode using vectortypes because my understanding is that this allows CPUs to vectorize the instructions and use SIMDinstructions. p  pMy question however is regarding which OpenCLimplementation to use. E.g. if the computer has a Nvidia GPU I assume its best to use Nvidias library but if no GPU is available I want to use Intels library to use the SIMDinstructions.p  pHow do I achieve this Is this handled automatically or do I have to include all libraries and implement some logic to pick the right one It feels like this is a problem that more people than I are facing. p  pstrongUpdatestrong After testing the different OpenCLdrivers this is my experience so farp  ul lipstrongIntelstrong crashed the JVM when JavaCL tried to call it.

The second execution caused a blueescreen of death.pli lipstrongAMDATIstrong Refused to install 32bit SDK I tried that since I will be using a 32bit JVM but 64bit SDK worked well. This is the only driver which Ive managed to execute the code on after a restart because at first it gave a cryptic errormessage when compiling. However it doesnt seem to be able to do any implicit vectorization and since I dont have any ATI GPU I didnt get any performance increase compared to the Javaimplementation. If I use vectortypes I might see some improvements though.pli ul  pstrongTLDRstrong None of the drivers seem ready for commercial use.

However, when using cat to read a text file, the program hangs. I determined that this is because reading a new line from the pty hangs.

The tiles pan gesture somewhat hides the scroll views own pan gesture. My idea was to disable the tiles pan gesture from the beginning. The gesture is enabled once the user does a long press on the tiles. The problem is that the user has to lift the finger and then touch the tile again to drag it. When the drag is finished, I enable the long press and disable the pan gesture again. So codelongPresscode looks as followsp  precode voidlongPressUILongPressGestureRecognizer  gestureRecognizer      for UIGestureRecognizer r in gestureRecognizer.view.gestureRecognizers          if [r isKindOfClass[UIPanGestureRecognizer class]]              [r setEnabledTRUE]                   pan gesture should take over here...  codepre  pIs there any possibility to glue the long press and the pan gestures together so that the user doesnt have to lift the finger Or maybe another solutionp

Negative 7330 pIm pretty new to manually manipulating images, so please bear with me.p  pI have an image that Im allowing the user to shrinkgrow and move around.p  pThe basic behavior works perfectly. However, I need to be able to grab whatever is in the viewport visible clipping region rectangle and save it out as a separate bitmap.p  pBefore I can do this, I need to get a fix on WHERE the image actually is and what is being displayed. This is proving more tricky than I would have imagined.p  pMy problem is that the Matrix documentation is absurdly vague, and Im lost as to how I can measure the coordinates and dimensions of my transformed image.  As I see it, the X,Y of the image remain constant even as the user shrinksgrows it.  So, even though it reports at being at 0,0 its displayed at say 100,100.  And the only way I can get those coordinates is to do a fairly ugly computation again... Im probably not doing it the most elegant way, since geometry is not my forte. p  pIm kind of hoping that Im missing something and that theres some way to pull the objects auto translated coordinates and dimensions. p  pin an ideal world I would be able to call pseudo codemyImg.getDisplayedWidthcode and codemyImg.getDisplayedXcode.p  pOh, and I should add that this may all be a problem that Im causing myself by using the center of the image as the point from which to growshrink.  If I left the default 0,0 coordinate as the non changing point, I think the location would be correct no matter what its size was.  So... maybe the answer to all this is to simply figure out my center offset and apply that to my translationsp  pAll help greatly appreciated and people not arbitrarily messing with my questions title even more so.p

Negative 7330 pHow can I add Connection KeepAlive and KeepAlive timeoutx, maxy headers to a response using Apache HttpComponents ONLY if the connection is going to be persistentp  pIf HttpComponents decides this connection wont be persistent, it adds a Connection close header after I give the response to it. I dont want a KeepAlive header in this case.p  pWhy Im doing thisp  pStandard behavior is for HttpComponents to change nothing in the response for a persistent connection, and add Connection close for nonpersistent connections. This works well in most cases.p  pI want to have a KeepAlive header because clients based on the standard java.net.HttpURLConnection will time out and throw away connections after 5 seconds of inactivity unless there is a KeepAlive header in the previous response from the server. I want to use KeepAlive to define a longer timeout than 5 seconds.p
Negative 7330 pI have a C program that creates an output file A with ofstream.  This file is then read by some legacy C code that opens the file with iobuf.  The legacy code then creates its own output file B using iobuf, and this file is then read by the C program using ifstream.  This sequence is iterated many times, with the same file names for A and B in each iteration.p  pOccasionally, the C program cannot open the output file A for writing, and I must try several times before it succeeds.  This occurs nondeterministically, and maybe once in a thousand iterations.  Note that the C program never has to wait to open its input or output file, nor does the C program ever have to wait to open its input file.  This informal observation is based on hundreds of thousands of iterations.p  pIm wondering if this has something to do with mixing ofstream and iobuf in the same program  Both the C code and the C code are linked into the same program.  And the legacy C code is technically C code, but was written in a very Clike style.  Is there anything I can do to eliminate this waiting to open the ofstream file  I do not want to change the legacy code if I can possibly avoid it.p  pPseudo code not compiledp  precodevoid someObjectsomeMethod      for int count  0 count lt someLimit count              newerObjectfirstMethod         olderObjectsecondMethod         newerObjectthirdMethod        void newerObjectfirstMethod       do some processing first       then write the results of the processing to a file     ofstream A     A.openA, ofstreamout  this sometimes must be tried multiple times      write data to file A     A.close   void olderObjectsecondMethod      FILE f     f  fopenA, rt  this always works the first time      read data from file A     fclosef       do some processing      f  fopenB, w      write data to file B     fclosef   void newerObjectthirdMethod      ifstream B     B.openB  this always works the first time      read data from file B     B.close       do some processing  codepre  pCurrently, as a work around, I put the ofstreamopen in a dowhile loop.

Negative 7330 pI implemented the publish subscribe pattern in a JavaScript module to be used by entirely clientside oriented JavaScript objects. This module has nothing to do with clientserver communications in any way, shape or form.p  pMy question is whether its better for the publish method in such a module to be synchronous or asynchronous, and why.p  pAs a very simplified example lets say Im building a custom UI for an HTML5 video player widgetp  pOne of my modules is the video module that contains the VIDEO element and handles the various features and events associated with that element. This would probably have a namespace something like widgets.player.video.p  pAnother is the controls module that has the various buttons  play, pause, volume, scrub, fullscreen, etc. This might have a namespace along the lines of widgets.player.controls.p  pThese two modules are children of a parent player module widgets.player , and as such would have no inherent knowledge of each other when instantiated as children of the player object.p  pThe controls elements would obviously need to be able to effect some changes on the video click Play and the video should play, and vice versa videos timeUpdate event fires and the visual display of the current time in the controls should update.p  pI could tightly couple these modules and pass references to each other, but Id rather take a more loosely coupled approach by setting up a pubsub type module that both can subscribe to and publish from.p  pSO thanks for bearing with me in this kind of a scenario is there an advantage one way or another for synchronous publication versus asynchronous publication Ive seen some solutions posted online that allow for eitheror with a boolean flag whereas others automatically do it asynchronously. I havent personally seen an implementation that just automatically goes with synchronous publication... is this because theres no advantage to itp  pI know that I can accomplish this with features provided by jQuery, but it seems that there may be too much overhead involved here. The publish subscribe pattern can be implemented with relatively lightweight code designed specifically for this particular purpose so Id rather go with that then a more general purpose eventing system like jQuerys which Ill use for more general eventing needs .p

Negative 7330 pIm currently having a data validation problem in Excel and may be the victim of overthinking the problem.p  pMy requirement is simple  I receive a large amount of xls files which all need to comply to an exact format.p  pFor example, I need all of the files I receive to have have the following strings in cells A1 to A3 FirstName, LastName, Email. Case matters.p  pIn reality, there are a lot more headers than this and trawling through every file and ensuring that all of the headings exist and are spelt correctlyin the correct case is very tedious and time consuming. I believe that it would be possible to create a module or tool in Visual Basic which could check the format and then return either correctfalse based on whether the file complies with the required format.p  pI have looked into regular expressions but believe that this may be overkill as I only require EXACT matches and have no experience in using VB. I have looked online for help  some of which has been useful, some of which has be way too advanced for the tool I need.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p
Negative 7330 pI only have a few months experience with XAML and often have a difficult time determining how to bind to or reference elements defined in various places in my XAML. I recently ran across XReference, which I understand is new with XAML 2009 and .NET 4.p  pFor example, assume I am trying to bind to the IsChecked property of an element named DisplayIndicator, which is defined elsewhere in my XAML. XReference allows me to do it as followsp  pcodeBinding SourcexReference DisplayIndicator, PathIsCheckedcodep  pThis seems like an easy way and preferred way to reference almost any element declared in my XAML. Am I wrong about this Is there a downside to using thisp  pThanks very much.p

Negative 7330 pIve launched a small Grails site a few month back and now I have to deploy incremental changes to the app, most of them not involving any db changes. New tags, bug fixes in controllers, services, ect. Right now Im simply picking through the haggis of classes and artifacts generated by running grails war SOMEWAR.war and manually dropping them into production environment. Youre probably right in your sentiments at the moment and believe me this process is quite the punishment in itself.  p  pAny suggestions on improving upon this p  ul liSeems like dropping an entire .war file into production every time something changes would be an overkill and theres the issue of client generated static content.li liFor instance uploaded images. At the moment theyre in a dir under images dir created when the project got initialized, theyre not stored in db either. I thought about storing them in db for archival and backup purposes so they could be written back into a dir should something unfortunate happen, but have not gone that far yet.li ul

This mean that my ListBox ItemsSource is set to Node1,Node2,Node3. p  pI then click on the Node1 which changes the SelectedItem. My Control then set its CurrentItem to this new SelectedItem, and also set the ListBox ItemsSource to SubNode1a, SubNode1b.p  pAfter that, if I use my Go Up command, the CurrentItem is reset to Root, and the ListBox ItemsSource to Node1,Node2,Node3, but there is a difference  The Node1 is selected.p  pThis makes me think of a CollectionViewSource which is reused, therefore keeping the selected item.

Negative 7330 pI have a C dll specifically a directshow filter which is being used in a 3rd party program. I am controlling it with a C program via shared memory so MemoryMappedFile on the C side, and CreateFileMapping on C.p  pstrongSo to be clear There is not 1 program. It is 2 different programs running at once, and I want the unmanaged code C program to invoke a method in the managed code program Cstrongp  pThe memory sharing works fine. I can use the C program to change and check values as the 3rd party program uses the dll.p  pThe problem is that I want to effectively databind some aspect of my C program to a value in the C dll. That is, when ever the value is changed in the dll being used by the 3rd party program, I want it to automagically update in the C program.p  pNow I can certainly just poll the value every second in another thread of my C program. But what I would like is to have my dll call a PropertyChangedEventHandler in C. Or at least call a method that invokes it.p  pMy first approach was to pass a delegate of a C method through an IntPtr via the shared memory.p  pSo the C looks at the shared memory and it sees a struct like sop  precodestruct MyStruct      ...some ints, etc     int ptr2Funcint not sure if I need to change this to a void pointer, but then how do I cast it to a function pointer in my C     ...etc  codepre  pmy C code looks at the shared memory and seesp  precodestruct MyStruct      ...the same ints as in the C     public IntPtr ptr2Func     etc..  codepre  pAs I said, all the other values in the shared memory struct work fine and I can manually check to see or modify values.p  pWhen the C dlls main process is initialized, it sets the ptr2Func to NULL. It then makes sure its not NULL before it tries to execute it.p  pThe C then sets it to a local methodp  precodeunsafe public delegate int mydelegateint input public myDelegate tempDele public int funcToBeCalledint input          return 2    this code is inside a button click method right after it connects the C program to the shared memory tempDele  this.funcToBeCalled sharedInstanceOfMyStructgtpt2Func  Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelegatetempDele codepre  pThe 3rd party program is fine until the function pointer in the struct is changed from being NULL and the code in the DLL tries to call it.p

Negative 7330 pI am designing a web site, spread across many servers, and there are pages where I need up to chain up to 4 redirections in a row.  I tried a few browsers firefox, chrome, IE and it seems to work fine.p  pApparently, Firefoxs default limit is 20 redirections in a row, Chromes default seems to be 20, and IE8s limit seems to be 10 redirections.p  pWhat is the maximum number of HTTP redirections allowed by all major browsers  Is it 10p  pstrongEditstrongp  pWhy do I need 4 redirections Basically, the user is in a hotspot, she tries to go to say google.com, there is a local captive portal that captures the request and redirects 1 the user to a local server.  The local server checks some things about the user, but if it does not have the data locally, it redirects 2 the user to the central web site.  If the user is already logged in to this central Web site, she gets redirected 3 to another server there are different portals depending on the user.  Finally, the server checks the users rights, and if she has the appropriate rights, there is a final 4 redirection to the local access controller, in order to get access to the appropriate service.  Believe me, I tried my best to remove redirections, but I cannot see where this can be optimized.p

Negative 7330 pI am trying to extract source code line, author label pair from git repositories. The easiest way to do that is using git blame. The problem is that git blame takes the last committer as the author no matter whether the committer just indents the code or really changes the code.  Do you know any method to it betterp  pOr maybe before trying to solve the problem, I should first check how many source lines are associated with multiple authors. If the percentage is small, there is no need to worry about it. But I find even counting the number is difficult.  For a commit with a single parent, how can we know that the commit changed a line rather deleted a line and added a lined For a commit with two parents like a merge, how should I combine the diff results from the two branchp  pThanks p

Negative 7330 pIm am writing a code to find the shortest distance between two points. My code is working perfect till now. I mean it finds the distance and the path that they should pass. I need to print this information, but I should make a print function. The way it works is something like that For example initial point is 4 and final is 13.p  pI should come up with an algorithm that check their intermediate points. Lets say between 4 amp 13 there is point  7p  p4713   Now I need to check every point between them likep  p467913 To be more specific it will check if there is a point between 46 and 67 and 79 and 913. So next in the next iteration it may be formed another list likep  p4267591713  Now lets say that there will not be any intermediate value between them. And that is what I should print. I really would appreciate any help, suggestion that you may give to mep

Negative 7330 p I have an app that run from multiple computers and must synchronize something between its internal database and one database from SQL server.p  pI use some temporary tables to insert internal databases data and then call an SP to synchronize data, it will process data rowbyrow and then either update them in SQL database, insert new rows or delete dropped rows. Since I should support customers that have SQL server 2000, I should have a solution other than codeMERGEcode.p  pThe problem is my SP work very well in SSMS but it suddenly fail when called from my application, I use C native code and use ODBC and SQL Native Client for connection with SQL server.p  pHere is of my database and SP definitionp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeIF NOT

Negative 7330 pIm banging my head here. Let Xx1,x2,...,xn is an integer set. Let A1,A2,...Am be the m subsets of X. For any i and j, Ai and Aj are not necessarily disjoint. Now the goal is to find the maximal value on each Ai i1,...,m efficiently, with the number of operations as fewer as possible.p  pFor example, given X2,4,6,3,1, and its subsets A12,3,1, A22,6,3,1, A34,2,3,1. We need to find MaxA1, MaxA2, MaxA3, respectively.p  pThe bruteforce way for finding MaxA1, MaxA2, MaxA3 is to scan all the elements in each Ai, and md operations are required, with m the number of subsets of X, and d the average length of the subsets Ai of X. p  pNow, I have some observationsp  p1 For any set YX, maxYmaxX,p  pFor instance, since MaxX6 and 6 is in A2, then MaxA26 can be found directly.p  p2 For any two sets A and B, if AB is nonempty, MaxA and MaxB can be identified as followsp  pFirst, we find the common parts between A and B, deonted as cmaxAB.p  pThen, we find MaxAMaxMaxAAB, c and MaxBMaxMaxBAB, c.p  pI am not sure whether there are some other interesting obervations for find these max values. Any ideas are warmly welcomep  pMy question is what if for the general case when Xx1,x2,...,xn and there are m subsets of X, denoted as A1,A2,...Am, is there some more efficient techniques to find such max values MaxAi i1,...,m  p  pYour help will be highly appreciatedp

I have three combo boxes, which populate the successors using queries triggered by the selections from the dropdown list.  My problem is that if the second combobox selection remains the same, the query is not triggered.  I have tried using onblur and several other events instead of onchange, and tried to reset the value of the selection in JS, but neither has worked.  The value is reset but the combobox still acts as if the same value is there, so onchange does not work.  I tried many of the methods in the link above, but none worked for me.  As far as I can tell, my comboboxes do not generate any selectedIndex. Any suggestions Thanks, Jp

Negative 7330 pOn a local development machine, I use Windows and PuTTY, with a linux server VM that I use to replicate the development environment for things like running tests and so forth. The VM VirtualBox uses a vboxfs share that contains my local projects.p  pI have set up msysgit on my machine to use PuTTY, my preferred SSH client, and that all works fine. Unfortunately, when I set a git remote URL, it has to use PuTTYs format to specify a session codesshltsession namegtltrepogtcode in order for msysgit to work, which means none of the git urls work in the VM environment. This isnt a huge deal, but I was curious Is there a way to reconcile the two configurations so I can use git commands in either environment without manually setting a remote url each timep

Negative 7330 pI find it difficult to understand emwhyem not how it is necessary to have a class attribute assigned to a div in order to change its position. For example, the following code wont move the div to 200,200p  precodethis.mtextLayer  document.createElement div   this.mtextLayer.setAttribute id, textLayer   this.mtextLayer.setAttribute position, absolute   this.mtextLayer.setAttribute left, 0px   this.mtextLayer.setAttribute top, 0px   this.mtextLayer.setAttribute width, 300px   this.mtextLayer.setAttribute height, 100px   this.mbaseLayer.appendChild this.mtextLayer   textLayer .append  p  .text test   some time later  textLayer .css  left200px, top200px    codepre  pbut having the class attribute point to a class definition in the css with the same attributes does work as expectedp  precodethis.mtextLayer  document.createElement div   this.mtextLayer.setAttribute id, textLayer   this.mtextLayer.setAttribute class, Layer   this.mbaseLayer.appendChild this.mtextLayer   textLayer .append  p  .text test   some time later  textLayer .css  left200px, top200px    codepre  pNow, I can speculate on the cause, as it probably has to do with there not being a css style defined when the class attr is not set or something, but could someone explain it to me in detail, or point me to some resource that explains precisely what actually happens here  Im definitely not new to programming, but I am new to cssjsjquery and find it hard to find information on the actual mechanics of js interpretation.p

Negative 7330 pI am involved in a project maintenance plan that involves either major refactoring or complete redesign. We have a very complicated existing technology stack that has evolved organically over a period of five years. I myself joined on three years ago, and was caught up in the madness. This stack was put together based on a clients evolving needs, and is fast becoming an unmanageable behemoth consisting of many technologies and uncontrollable collection of data.p  pOur primary goal is to make the stack more workable and manageable, and come up with a better system to manage data in the future. We would like to convert a tightly integrated Business Model and REST Controller system written primarily in PHP into a coherent REST API. p  pOur PHP Business Model relies on the eXist XML database, which contains most of the data, and MySQL which supports 2 of our subapplications data. We have a library of SQL and XQuery source codes to manage the data in the data stores dynamically. There are also parts of the business model that relies on Java code by using the PHPJava Bridge and SAXON and FOP to create PDF facsimiles of documents stored in the XML database. Since this is a web application, we use a combination of PHPTAL, XSLT, CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript to facilitate the client UI. Lastly, we have a bunch of housekeeping scripts that manage PHP, Apache, functions written in Perl, that are managed using Ant tasks.p  pThe basic functions of the stack are to facilitate electronic forms for a variety of user models. The simple philosophy behind the application was undermined over the years by a combination of client fiddling, excessive enduser hand holding, lack of systems analyses oversight, bad testing methodologies and lack of future goals and welldefined project scope.p  pWe are currently planning to arrest any further development, better describe the system which may or may not include better unit test plans, and create the foundation for an API using the same technology components. My gut reaction is to come up with a solid scope and redesign the system using a wellsupported programming language and framework that is well suited for writing web APIs, possibly loose some functionality, but retain the functionality that matters the most. I would also recommend migrating the existing data to a separate readonly platform.p  pMy question to those who have been in similar situations arep  ul lihow did you get out of this kind of situationli liwhat sort of planning steps would be useful to employ in these kinds of situationli liare there source code management techniques for these kinds of stacks what do I look for  search keywords li ul  pI realize that there are no perfect solutions, and that to answer these questions, I would need to specify our project issues further. I can not really do that for a variety of reasons. I am having problems finding useful resources to help me approach this issue, and I would appreciate advice on how to proceed. p

If it is, the projector moves on to the next pattern in its queue if not it waits some more.p  pThis approach is a hot mess, and it doesnt even workthere is no guarantee that the projector wont move on to the next pattern between emitting codepatternProjectedcode and receiving the connection from the camera.p  pAnyone have a cleaner approach, ideally one more in line with the codeQObjectcode philosophyp

Negative 7330 pI have been searching the web for a while now and no solutions found have been working out for me. So, I turn to you. p  pI get a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError when I try to integrate the API of BIRT an eclipse plugin for reports and documents. I copy paste their code, include ALL of the jar file in the lib folder birtruntime422ReportEnginelib and still I get the NoClassDefFoundError.

Negative 7330 pLets say Im working on a refresh of the UI for my app so I have a branch called v2 to cover all of the code for that project.p  pNow lets say that I have a branch called v2123 representing a particular feature in user story 123, and that my work is more or less complete but is awaiting QA testing approval.p  pLets then say that I have another user story 456 which is blocked by user story 456 in that I need the changes in story 123 to be able to work on the changes for 456.p  pWould it be viable to create branch v2456 off of v2123 knowing that its likely QA testing on 123 will complete before I finish working on 456 Would there be problems with then squashing v2123 back into v2, immediately rebasing v2456 with v2 and then later down the line merging v2456 back onto v2p  pOr would it be better to just wait until v2123 has been squashed back onto v2 and branch v2456 off of v2 The key thing is that I wouldnt want the merging of v2123 back onto v2 to be held up by having to complete v2456 first I want to be able to merge v2123 onto v2 as soon as QA testing comes back successful.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7330 pIm looking for a good sane approach for my applications data model. Most threads focus on ecommerce products and my scenario is somewhat different.p  pThe goal is storing received items from customers and reporting back on them.  Although initial reports will be simple lists these are your items and their keyvalue pairs I want to prepare for future queries on the collections as a whole, so Im uncertain EAV is a good approach.p  pEach item is of a recurring type, and each item will have a flexible amount of keyvalue pairs.  We have about 15 item types and theyre not very likely to grow fast.p  pThe amount of keyvalue pairs will be low, between 4 and 20 and is per requirement strongnot based on the item type, but on the customer the items belong tostrong. p  pTo clarify, a customer might want me to store the condition of the item where another might want me to store the color or a replacementid. It really depends.  So it is very likely I will have NULL values in my set anyway as each item type will get all the keyvalues of that customer anyway. That makes me think emSingle Table Inheritanceem with NULL values is acceptable, but it would have to be field1 field2 etc  with some sort of mapping because the customer will decide on name of their desired keys. Which doesnt seem right to mep  pA collection of customer items and their keyvalues will usually be 20 and lt500, so the data sets per customer are certainly not enormous.p  pPerhaps it would be good approach to go semiEAV in MySQL for the application itself creating the customer and their desired fields but move the actual collected item records as a document into a NoSQL database Redis et all for further processing p  pOr is that over complicating things that canshould be solved in a RDBMSp  pI also came across this a hrefhttpbackchannel.orgblogfriendfeedschemalessmysqlhttpbackchannel.orgblogfriendfeedschemalessmysqla which seems like a solution but not sure since my numbers are so low. p

There are some empty strings in the output. I later found better ways like list comprehensions code[x for x in lst if x]code or creating a new list and copying the non empty strings to it, which happens to be more efficient than the above code because it doesnt involve shifting the position every time you remove an element from the list.p  pI however have some questions regarding the output of the code above.p  pFirst question is, why doesnt the loop run ten timesthe iteration number is on     the far left because the original length of the list is ten.     Second, if you look at the rightmost column, you realize that it doesnt print print the codecode string. It totally skips it My theory is that the codeincode operator is sugarmost likely for an index so that even if the length of the list changes the index keeps increasing by one. This would explain why on the third iteration the value of codeicode is the empty string and not the codecode since codelst[2]code is codecode.p  pIs there something I need to know when using the in operatorp

The flaw is that change sets are time stamped at the time of commit  not when theyre pushed.  So if someone does a commit but no push at 9pm on 73013 and then a push the next day on 73113.  Doingp  pcodegit checkout git revlist n 1 before20130731 001 mastercodep  pgets different results depending on whether or not the checkout was done before or after the push.p  pAm I misunderstanding something or is there a better way to do this in git  p
Negative 7330 pSo heres the scenario. p  pI need to pull data from XML files located on the web individually this is easy enough, but my problem is that a new file with an incremented filename is added from from time to time. p  pSo for example, one day a filename may be www.website.com00001.xml and the next day, a new file is added as www.website.com00002.xmlp  pI need to create a script, ideally in PHP, that will automatically refresh every couple of hours and pull the data from the new XML file, if the xml file is not present yet then it will retry that same number again. Hopefully all this can then just be put into rows in an excel file.p  pThe question is basically, what is the best way to go about this if anyone could point me to something similar thats already out there, then that would be great.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7330 pIve found several different questions about this error, but none of them seem to outline my scenario.  p  pI am creating a website that pulls in tweets from our companys Twitter account, and displaying them on a social wall.  I am using C asp.NET webforms.  The C code uses a Linqtotwitter library to handle the authentication and the tweet pulling.  It grabs the tweets and dumps them onto an aspx file as a big long string of json.  We then have a jquery script that reads through the json and displays the tweets on the page nice and pretty like.p  pThe code currently works perfect on my dev box.  But when I push the code up to production I get this .NET error p  blockquote   pThe remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedurep blockquote  pIll provide my code in a bit here, but first let me give you a little background.  I have no idea if this information would be relevant or not, but who knows.  This website is actually part of a larger project to fit several tiny one page microsites that we get from marketing onto one server to reduce the overhead they cause.  These microsites can all have a different host name, but they point to the same IP address.  An httpmodule lives on that server, and intercepts all requests coming in, and redirects them to an appropriate sub folder depending on the host name.  p  pFrom the research that Ive done, it seems that SSL is tied into this error quite a bit.  Im still pretty new to the IT world, and Im learning more about SSL as this troubleshooting goes on.  The server these microsites live on does have a few SSL certificates on it, and one of the microsites uses SSL, but not the website Im currently working on.  But since they both share the same IP address in that sense they kind of ARE the same website.  p  pThis is the C LinqtoTwitter codep  precode    private SingleUserAuthorizer auth     private TwitterContext twitterCtx      protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              Response.ContentType  applicationjson          auth  new SingleUserAuthorizer                      Credentials  new SingleUserInMemoryCredentials                              ConsumerKey                      ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[twitterConsumerKey],                 ConsumerSecret                      ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[twitterConsumerSecret],                 TwitterAccessToken                      ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[twitterAccessToken],                 TwitterAccessTokenSecret                      ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[twitterAccessTokenSecret]                                if auth.IsAuthorized                      twitterCtx  new TwitterContextauth             var tweetResponse             from tweet in twitterCtx.Status             where tweet.Type  StatusType.User ampamp                   tweet.ScreenName  OurProfile ampamp                   tweet.IncludeRetweets  true             select tweet            .ToList              Results.Text  twitterCtx.RawResult                     protected override void OnPreRenderEventArgs e              base.OnPreRendere          if twitterCtx  null                      twitterCtx.Dispose             twitterCtx  null               codepre  pDoes anyone have any ideas of what could be the problem here  Like I said, Im still pretty new, and Im at a loss here even how to troubleshoot this issue beyond Google.

Negative 7330 pLast week I had an interesting issue arise when I was building a new SSIS package with a script task. At one point in the process of building and debugging the debugger suddenly stop hitting my break points. At the time I thought maybe the debugger got hung up or something weird like that. So I did a restart on the server and reopened SSIS. p  pWhen I opened up my package that I had been working on for the last few days, and then opened the script task. the script task was empty had the default code you get when you create a new script task lost all my work. I started building it again as I had a really good idea on what I had already built. I rebuilt a few functions and tried to debug, it would not hit any break points still. Saved my current progress and rebooted again.p  pAfter the reboot I opened up my script task, again lost all my work. At this point I am unable to get SSIS to save any script task and I am unable to debug any script task code, including already built packages. I have scoured the net looking for an answer and have found no clue as to what is going on. HELPp  pPrior to this happening, I had no issues debugging or saving packages. I have already reinstalled SSIS once and still does the same thing...p

Negative 7330 pIs it possible to use clientside and serverside oauth2 authentication without requiring separate user logins for eachp  pThe cross client identity page seems to be exactly what I want, but it doesnt describe how to achieve this for web client and server projects. a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsCrossClientAuth relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comaccountsdocsCrossClientAuthap  pSpecifically, here is what Im trying to achieve I have a web app which uses the drive api to create files and the drive realtime api for collaborative editing of documents, so I need to do clientside authentication. I also want to allow users to publicly share readonly copies of the documents with other users. I want to do this by storing a snapshot of the document data in google app engine that can be read by anyone, but can only be written by the user that created the google doc. This suggests that I need serverside authentication. But is there any way to do this without requiring the user to log in once for the clientside access, then again for the server side accessp  pThis question seems to be similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15415442authenticatinggusersontheserversideafterclientsideloginAuthenticating G users on the server side, after clientside logina but the accepted answer seems to suggest simply storing the user id on app engine and checking that the user id on the client side matches. That seems like one would only need to know the user id of the file creator to overwrite the document on the app engine server, which is not secure.p

Negative 7330 pI am looking for a mapping solution for my department.  We have servers set up at multiple locations within the continental U.S.  At each of these sites, is multiple servers, that handle multiple data types.  The overall goal of this map is to be able to select andor filter, to help my team and I keep track of our assets.p  pSo we have sites at locations like Orlando and San Francisco.  At each of these sites, is a few data types.  I would like the map to be clickable for one...be able to select a site.  When I select a site, it should show me all of the servers in the correct setup, and the data flowing through them.  I should also have a legend that shows the data types and corresponding color for it.  The color would be for the line that is drawn across the map that shows the data flowing from site to site, and then from server to server.  So on the legend, I should be able to select a data type, and have it show or highlight just that data flow, so I can track it easier.  Of course labels and other interactivity would be terrific as well.p  pDoes anyone have a legitimate solution for this, preferably something free or cheap  Hopefully something manageable for a novice.  I was looking at possibly a jQuery solution using jVector maps.  I was not sure if this had all of the potential I was looking for.  Thank you in advance.p

Negative 7330 pI want to integrate Struts 2, Hibernate and Spring. I made a previous example project with Hibernate, Spring, Spring MVC. And it worked fine. Now I want to replace Spring MVC with Struts 2. And I have following problem. I have LoginAction class with field codeAutowired private UserService userServicecode. UserService class contains as a field UserDAO field that also annotated as Autowired. UserDAO contains SessionFactory that annotated too. Im sure that struts confiration is right.

Negative 7330 pIs there a way to implement functionality so that a user can Right click a subsection of an Html page say a DIV or other container element so that that part can be saved as an imagepdf using javascriptp  pAlternatively ideally  can this be done on the server side in ASP.NETp  pThe use case for this is the followingp  pI have some complex web pages generated in asp.NET and using the javscript Flot library for the graphs.  I would like to reuse part of the html page to generate PDF reports or at least image snapshots which can easily be inserted into reports.  I have looked around and it seems there is a tool wkhmltopdf which converts the entire page to PDF, however there are 2 issuesp  ol liThis tool needs to be run separately, which is not friendly for end usersli liThe tool extracts everything on the page, e.g. menus headers , footers etc.li ol  pFor the second problem I could generate web pages without the headersfooters and menus, and then use the tool, but this does not solve problem 1.  Ideally I would like to generate the report weekly and automatically so the user only needs to download it.p  pFor this purpose what is really needed is some way to  store as pdf or image a DIV or other element referenced by id.  This way I would not need to write separate code to generate the reports.  I realize there will be a loss of quality converting html to PDF, but for our purposes, this is not that important.p

Negative 7330 pI was asked such question, what is the minimal time needed to compute the minimal value of an unsorted array of 32 integers, given that you have 8 cores and each comparison takes 1 minute. My solution is 6 minutes, assuming that each core operates independently. Divide the array into 8 portions, each has 4 integers, 8 cores concurrently compute the local min of each portion, takes 3 minutes, 3 comparisons in each portion. Then 4 cores to compute the local min of those 8 local mins, 1 minute. Then 2 cores to compute the 4 local mins, 1 minute, then 1 core to compute the global min among the remaining 2 mins, 1 minute. Therefore, the total amount is 6 minutes. However, it didnt seem to be the answer that the interviewer was looking for. So what do you guys think about it Thank you p

Negative 7330 pIm working on a Windows Setup Project in Visual Studio. In the File System editor, below the Users Programs Menu node, I have a folder for my application that contains several shortcuts. One shortcut serves to launch the application a different one restores the applications factory settings so it also calls the application, but with an argument.p  pAfter running the installer, the folder  and shortcuts it contains  are created correctly in the Start Menu. Additionally, without any action on my behalf, the installer creates an additional shortcut at the top level of the Start Menu i.e. its visible when one opens the Start Menu by clicking the Start button.p  pThis additional shortcut used to be the one for launching the application. That was fine. But since I added the Factory reset shortcut, this is the one that appears at the top level of the Start Menu. This is pointless, and will just confuse users. Is there any way to change thisp  pEDIT clarification Since I added the Factory reset shortcut, only this shortcut appears at the top level of the Start Menu which I dont want, and the shortcut to launch the application no longer appears but I want it to. Note that all shortcuts emin the Start Menus subfolderem are correct. What Im referring to here is the single shortcut that appears automatically at the top level of the Start Menu immediately visible when the Start button is clicked.p

Negative 7330 pI understand that you can find the MPT by taking the log of every edge in the graph and calculating the MST.  The constraint here of course is that the values of the edges must be positive, because you cannot take codelogxcode where codex lt 0code.  I am trying to find an algorithm that can be used to calculate the MPT when edge values can be positive, zero, or negative, but I couldnt find any resources online that would explain how to handle this case.  Can someone either provide a resource or algorithm that allows for MPT to be calculated when the positive constraint is lifted  Alternatively, if someone can provide a hint in the right direction so that I could figure out the algorithm independently, that would work too.p

Negative 7330 pOkay, so.  I am making a text based game and I require a name input field.  I looked at a lot of ways to do it, but couldnt understand most of them, or they were such workarounds that I couldnt justify making such messy code.  This is what I have for my current script.p  precodefunction handlereventKeyboardEvent      ifevent.charCode  13              Input.toString         myText  Input.text         tracemyText       codepre  pSorry I dont know how to make those fancy blocks I see all over this site. Sp  pAll I need it to do is take the input text from a field and assign a string to that text when the enter key is pressed.p  pOkay.  The code works.  However, since Enter is the key I press to submit the inout, it adds a second blank line.  And everytime I type something new, it adds it to the string.p  pI.E.  Say I go and type my name as Will  And then press enter.  It outputs rWill rp  pIf I type something new, like Bill it outputs Will Bill r rp  pAnd the blank just gets bigger because it keeps creating new lines.p

Negative 7330 pI have several dynamically created elements on a page that I would like to POST the contents using jQuery to another page. The problem is, the elements created cannot be accessed via jQuery only elements that existed on the page can be accessed using the myElementID.

Is this simply not possible to do with jQueryp  precode    btnParseTable.clickfunction           var tblCustomPattern  tblCustomPattern.innerHTML       This test alert yields  because tblCustomPattern is undefined  yet FireBug clearly shows the table exists         alerttblCustomPattern     var postData   method ParseTable, tbl tblCustomPattern          .posttiler.aspx, postData, function data              test.htmldata for testing            codepre  pIf not supported by jQuery, can this be done in JavaScript or is it not possible to post back information that is NOT an INPUT elementp
Negative 7330 pEvening everyone, I have a page that updates a mysql table recordrow using a form. When you go to page xyz.php there is a drop down list. Upon selecting the codeartIDcode from the drop down list and hitting submit, a form is displayed. The form is prepopulated using artId and matching to the mysql query that is pulled from at the beginning of the script. The code below works perfectly. p  pMy question however is, can this be down more efficiently Specifically the prepopulated form. Im using an codeifcode statement to find the index of the array that the artId is nested in. Then using the vars of the indexed array to populate the form. This seams it would be pretty taxing if the sql query is large.p  pIm also using 2 codeforeachcode constructs for the same data. Im still working on how to eliminate one of them without botching up the whole form. p  pAny suggestions or thoughts for a direction to run to are much appreciated as always.

Negative 7330 pI just implemented Google Analytics v3 into my android app and have some small qtns. Im familiar with Google Analytics for webpages but not apps.p  pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comanalyticsdevguidescollectionandroidv3dispatch relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comanalyticsdevguidescollectionandroidv3dispatchap  pQ1 How does real time data work when the default dispatch period is half an hour Also Im assuming that 30 mins is only for when the app is running, right By my experience, the real time data only shows one screenview which corresponds to me opening the app. All subsequent screenviews are not shown in real time UNTIL I close the app and reopen. Its almost like this triggers the dispatch to occur causing all the queued data to get dispatched. Is this normal behaviourp  pThis is not ideal for my app since it will probably be only used for 5 mins at a time. Ive been reading up on manual dispatches, which leads me to my next question...p  pQ2 Is it a bad idea to turn off the periodic dispatch and make my app manually dispatch the data everytime a screenview takes place I mean periodic dispatch is probably employed so that the data can be batchsent to the server all at once so that communication with the server isnt as frequent right Using manual dispatches is the only way I can imagine that the real time data would be accurate...Im interested in the real time data so this is quite important for me although I dont want to be doing frequent dispatches if it is going to be too intensive for my app...what do you thinkp  pThanks for all your help p

To put it simply the website allows users to post ads. The ads are supposed to expire after 30 days. The status of the ad is regulated by a status column in the database. So if I set the status to E the add will not show up anymore.p  pMy current solution is to query the database and check for expired ads by putting this logic in the sessionstart method. I dont believe this is the best way of solving this problem. Ive noticed that it sometimes takes awhile for the homepage to load when accessing the site and Im blaming this implementation.p  pI was curious if there are better solutions out there. I was imagining a constant polling of the database to update the statuses if necessary but Im not sure where to start when the website is hosted on azure.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7330 pId like to use java util logging in my applet, at log level FINE and below.p  pIve put a codelogging.propertiescode file in my applets jar which saysp  precodehandlers java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler .level FINE java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level  FINE codepre  pand in my applet class, I feed it to the log manager usingp  precodelogManager.readConfigurationgetClass.getResourceAsStreamlogging.properties codepre  pThis successfully causes my debug logging to appear in the applets console window, however as I shouldve expected, the java platform also begins to log its FINE level messages to the console.p  pWorse, the act of logging a message to the Java console, of itself, causes more AWT logging This generates an infinite loop of messages in my console along the lines ofp  precode203155 java.awt.mixing.Component FINE this  javax.swing.JTextArea[...] 203155 java.awt.mixing.Container FINE this  javax.swing.JViewport[...] codepre  pI thought this should be easy to fix by addingp  precodejava.levelINFO javax.levelINFO sun.levelINFO codepre  pto my logging.properties file.p  pHowever, this does not work. The platform logging keeps spewing out, no matter what I write in the properties file.p  pIve dived into the source code. The LogManager appears to be keeping two different LoggingContexts. One for the user, one system context. My logging.properties file only affects the Loggers in the user LoggingContext, and therefore cannot influence the platform loggings settings.p  pThe LogManager does share the rootLogger between the user LoggingContext and the system LoggingContext. And when I set its level to FINE, I get the infinite stream of awt blurb as a side effect.p  pSo my question is How can I get my user contexts Loggers to log at level FINE by default but keep the system loggers at INFO levelp

Negative 7330 pI am developing a GWT based client server web application.p  pThe application installs a web site on the IIS. When clients first browse to the web site, they need to run a local installation, which installs a local process and a NPAPI plugin on the client computer.p  pThe client runs in browsers such as IE, Chrome and Firefox, and uses the NPAPI plugin to send messages to the local process. The local process is used for accessing the file system, registry, etc.p  pIn order to prevent other web sites from using the NPAPI plugin, When a user first login, the server sends him a hash of a string which contains the URL of the site  some other data. The NPAPI plugin has access to the current URL of the browser, and also creates the same hash and compares the two.p  pDue to Chrome upcoming end of support of NPAPI plugins, I am trying to replace the plugin with a Chrome extension, and a native messaging host. The extension cant be limited to a certain domain because it can be used from many domains. p  pI am trying to figure out a way to prevent other web sites from using the extension to send messages to the native host but cant find a way to do it. Does anyone have an idea how I can accomplish thatp  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 7330 pIve been diagnosing a performance issue with generating a CSV containing around 50,000 lines and Ive narrowed it down to a single function that is used once per line.p  pAfter a lot of messing about, Ive discovered that there is an overhead in using the function, rather than placing the logic directly in the loop  my question is Whyp  pThe function in question is very simple, it accepts a string argument and passes that to a switchcase block containing around 15 options  returning the resulting string. Ive put a bunch of timers all over the place and discovered that a lot not all of the time this function call takes between 0 and 200 ms to run... however if I put the exact same code inline, it sits at 0 on every iteration.p  pAll this points to a fundamental issue in my understanding of object instantiation and Id appreciate some clarification.p  pI was always under the impression that if I instantiate a component at the top of a page, or indeed if I instantiate it in a persistent scope like Application or Session, then it would be placed into memory and subsequent calls to functions within that component would be lightning fast.  It seems however, that there is an overhead to calling these functions and while were only talking a few milliseconds, when you have to do that 50,000 times it quickly adds up. p  pFurthermore, it seems that doing this consumes resources. Im not particularly well versed in the way the JVM uses memory, Ive read up on it and played with settings and such, but its an overwhelming topic  especially for those of us with no Java development experience. It seems that when calling the method over inline code, sometimes the ColdFusion service just collapses and the request never ends. Other times it does indeed complete, although way too slowly. This suggests that the request can complete only when the server has the resources to handle it  and thus that the method call itself is consuming memory... p  pIf indeed the calling of a method has an overhead attached, I have a big problem. Its not really feasible to move all of this code inline, while the function in question is simple, there are plenty of other functions that I will need to make use of and doing so goes against everything I believe as a developerp  pSo, any help would be appreciated.p  pJust for clarity and because Im sure someone will ask for it, heres the code in questionp  pstrongEDITstrong As suggested, Ive changed the code to use a struct lookup rather than CFSwitch  below is amended code for reference, however theres also a test app in pastebin links at the bottom.p  pstrongInside the init methodstrongp  precode    ltcfset  Variables.VehicleCategories               T1     Beetle         ,   T1C    Beetle Cabrio         ,   T2     Type 2 Split         ,   T2B    Type 2 Bay         ,   T25    Type 25         ,   Ghia   Karmann Ghia         ,   T3     Type 3         ,   G1     MK1 Golf         ,   G1C    MK1 Golf Cabriolet         ,   CADDY  MK1 Caddy         ,   G2     MK2 Golf         ,   SC1    MK12 Scirocco         ,   T4     T4         ,   CO     Corrado         ,   MISC   MISC      gt codepre  pstrongFunction being calledstrongp  precodeltcffunction namegetCategory returntypestring outputfalsegt     ltcfargument namevehicleID requiredtrue typestring hintVehicle type gt      ltcfscriptgt         if structKeyExistsVariables.VehicleCategories, Arguments.VehicleID              return Variables.VehicleCategories[Arguments.VehicleID]                  else              return Base SKUs              ltcfscriptgt ltcffunctiongt codepre  pAs requested, Ive created a test application to replicate this issuep  pa hrefhttppastebin.comKE2kUwEfhttppastebin.comKE2kUwEfa  Application.cfcp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comX8ZjL7D7httppastebin.comX8ZjL7D7a  TestCom.cfc Place in com folder outside webrootp  pa hrefhttppastebin.comn8hBLrfdhttppastebin.comn8hBLrfda  index.cfmp

Negative 7330 pWhen creating a control in xaml, I could do two thingsp  ol liCreate a StackPanel, add a few TextBlocks, a Rectangle et.cli liCreate a templated control, and add that to my MainPage.xamlli ol  pIn terms of performance only, which one would be better Both work fine, as I see it.p  pTypically, at the top of a page, I would create a kind of header panel, containing some text blocks, some visual indicator et.c. The control isnt that big, perhaps it contains 1012 children. Usually, I just type it up directly in the page xaml, as it isnt reused anywhere. But I usually apply some kind of animation to the header panel lets say it is part of a FeatheredTransition when loading the page.p  pSo my question is would there be any performance advantage from a xaml loaderrendereranimation perspective if I create a template control first Whats the general recommendationp

It would basically be a checkbox that says Send me emails. If the box is unchecked false, they never get system emails except password resets. If the box is checked true, theyre eligible to get system emails. pli lipOpt inout for several system emailsp  pIf the master switch is true eligible for emails, the next of configuration is that I offer checkboxes for individual system emails New message received, New comment on thread I started. They can opt into or out of each system email.pli lipOpt inout for some emails with additional delivery optionsp  pFinally, some emails will be summary emails, and Ill want to know if the user is eligible to receive the email emandem how often they want to receive it. For example, a daily summary of account activity. I want to allow them to opt inout of the email, and to tell me which weekdays to send the summary if they opt in.

The issue was that scaling it was tough  any time I created a new system email based on some event, I had to add a column to my EmailPreferences table. It was also tricky because the table was mostly booleans, so I could have a in or out true or false setting, but not much more. I also found it pretty difficult to figure out whether a user should get an email because I had to chain methods to get to the ultimate question, Should I send this email to this user as a result of this eventp

Negative 7330 pSo I have an application where Im considering moving from PyQt4 to PySide. In this application, I use code.uicode files pretty frequently, with the following usage patternp  precodeclass BaseGUIWidgetQWidget     def initself, parent  None, uifile  None                  param parent parent widget of this widget         param uifile path to UI file to load optional                  superBaseGUIWidget, self.initparent         if uifile is not None             uic.loadUiuifile, self codepre  pLets assume I have similar classes for codeQFramecode, codeQMainWindowcode, codeQGroupBoxcode, etc.p  pThis allows me to create python classes that use the data from the UI file, as well as any additional functionality I add manually in the code. Essentially, my codeBaseGUIWidgetcode class acts as if it was extending the class generated by the UI file. A lot of the functionality in the application is pretty reliant on this behavior.p  pHowever, from what I can tell, PySides codeQUIloadercode doesnt have a similar functionality. Instead of shimming the UI files contents into your class, it simply builds a widget from the UI file internally, then returns it, and you then embed it into your widget in a codelayoutcode like you would any other widget., I.Ep  precodeclass BaseGUIWidgetQWidget     def initself, parent  None, uifile  None                  param parent parent widget of this widget         param uifile path to UI file to load optional                  superBaseGUIWidget, self.initparent         self.setLayoutQVBoxLayout         if uifile is not None             loader  QUILoader             uifile  QFileuifile             uifile.openQFile.ReadOnly                             self.uiwidget  loader.loaduifile, self             self.layout.addWidgetself.uiwidget             uifile.close codepre  pThis is a pretty massive difference. If, for example, you wanted your UI file to contain a codeQMainWindowcode and your python class to still be an extension of codeQMainWindowcode so it acts like one to other classes, youd wind up with a codeQMainWindowcode inside a codeQMainWindowcode, which isnt what you want. It also means you have to do codewidget.uiwidget.XXXcode to access the widgets produced by the UI file.p  pIs there any way to make PySides stronguicstrong implementation act like PyQtsp
Negative 7330 pI want to know about file sharing encryption in windows 7 and windows 8.1. Scenario is I want to share file between two machines with enabled end to end encryption in flight. Now according to my research, SMB2.0 is used to share files and there is no endtoend encryption in SMB 2.0 which means if network packet is captured without IPSec then content of file can be seen in READ RESPONSE packet. While in windows 8.1 and server 2012, SMB3.0 has been introduced which provides endtoend encryption for onflight file sharing.p  pFirstly, I have confusion in default security option for file sharing in windows 7 and 8. File sharing security can be enabled from  Control PanelAll Control Panel ItemsNetwork and Sharing CenterAdvanced sharing settings by enabling use 128bit encryption to help protect file sharing connection. What does this option do With this option being enabled if i capture data at network layer using wireshark, will it show me encrypted content of shared file Well I have captured and it shows plain text data. Can anyone tell me how this option worksp  pSecondly, I have shared file between machines running windows 8.1. here again in wireshark captured packet details SMB2.0 is used. Can we enable SMB3.0 for file sharing between peers running windows 8.1 so that files are end to end encrypted inflight I have seen that in server 2012 the option of encrypted access can be enabled for specific shared folders but how this end to end encryption of SMB3.0 can be enabled between peers of 8.1p

Negative 7330 pWe are using TFS 2013 and the latest Scrum template. From my understanding, bugs and PBIs are at the same level in the backlog.p  pBut how to handle bugsissues, that are found during a sprint in a readyfortest PBIp  pWhen a developer finishes a PBI, he moves it in the KanbanBoard from emIn Progressem to emReady For Testem.p  pThen our Testers test this PBI userstory using Microsofts TestManager. When they find an issue, the create a new bug. The advantage of doing so, is that we get a good documentation of the observed problem automatically in the bug workitem.p  pBut from my point of view, its not a bug. Its simply an unfinished PBIp  pThe main problem with this approach is, that its cluttering up the Kanbanboard and the backlog very quickly.p  pWhat is best practice in that case  Is there somewhere a guideline  whitepaper for this scenariop  pOr maybe we are just using the TestManager in the wrong wayp

It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2 for detailed information about  the directives and usrsharedocapache2commonREADME.Debian.gz about  Debian specific hints.    Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian  The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to  upstreams suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debians  default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,  virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in  order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as  possible.   It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined  below, all located in the etcapache2 directory     etcapache2     apache2.conf         ports.conf     modsenabled        .load        .conf     conf.d             sitesenabled              apache2.conf is the main configuration file this file. It puts the pieces    together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the    web server.     In order to avoid conflicts with backup files, the Include directive is    adapted to ignore files that     do not begin with a letter or number     contain a character that is neither letter nor number nor .     contain .dpkg     Yet we strongly suggest that all configuration files either end with a    .conf or .load suffix in the file name. The next Debian release will    ignore files not ending with .conf or .load for modsenabled.    ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is    supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections, and which    of these ports are used for name based virtual hosts.    Configuration files in the modsenabled and sitesenabled directories    contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules or virtual    host configurations, respectively.     They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their    respective available counterparts. These should be managed by using our    helpers a2enmoda2dismod, a2ensitea2dissite. See    their respective man pages for detailed information.    Configuration files in the conf.d directory are either provided by other    packages or may be added by the local administrator. Local additions    should start with local or end with .local.conf to avoid name clashes. All    files in conf.d are considered excluding the exceptions noted above by    the Apache 2 web server.    The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in    the default configuration, apache2 needs to be startedstopped with    etcinit.dapache2 or apache2ctl. Calling usrbinapache2 directly will not    work with the default configuration.    Global configuration     ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.

If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, textplain is  a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications  or images, you may want to use applicationoctetstream instead to  keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are  text.   It is also possible to omit any default MIME type and let the  clients browser guess an appropriate action instead. Typically the  browser will decide based on the files extension then. In cases  where no good assumption can be made, letting the default MIME type  unset is suggested  instead of forcing the browser to accept  incorrect  metadata.

Negative 7330 pI have been using sdbm to manage some keyvalue stores to help improve the application response time, and reduce pressure on the MySQL server. My code is a little bit clunky due to the nature of SDBM and the keyvalue stores SDBM creates are not inmemory data structures, but rather saved to the file system or at least this is my understanding of SDBM.p  pI realize that theres Memecached or Redis that can be used, but this is probably an overkill for my application. Are there any recommendations for something inbetweenp  pI realize that there is no code in my question, but I imagine that this is a coding prerequisite if you want an application that performs well and allows you to have a smaller footprint less memory and less expensive CPU, which is what programmers should seek.p

Negative 7330 pstrongIm looking for the best way to center and offset a rotation pivot on an object using openGL shaders. There are differences in 3d apps in how they handle this.strongp  hr  pemI have an object which I set translation to 0,2,2, rotation to 90,0,0 and move the pivot to 5,2,0 and then rotate or not arbitrarily. Then I want to center the pivot on the object to the translated bb centeremp  pIve tried variations of this modelMatrix without success in all scenarios where pivRT is the difference to the BBcenter  codemodelM  translationM  pivRT  glminversepivotM  rotationM  scaleM  pivotMcodep  h1In Mayah1  pI center the pivot on the object strongand no values visible to the user changestrong. In other apps such as blender the translation changes when you center the pivot  in fact your objects translation becomes the pivots translation. Reading up on how this works, in the a hrefhttpdownload.autodesk.comglobaldocsmaya2014enusCommandsPythonxform.html relnofollowxforma command or a hrefhttpdownload.autodesk.comusmaya2011helpAPIclassmtransformationmatrix.html relnofollowMTransformationMatrixa class, Maya has the transformation matrix as p  blockquote   p[Sp]x[S]x[Sh]x[Sp]x[St]x[Rp]x[Ro]x[R]x[Rp]x[Rt]x[T]p      pwith Rt being the strongRotate pivot translationstrong matrix which is   emtranslation introduced to preserve exisiting rotate transformations when moving pivot. This is used to prevent the object from moving when   the objects pivot point is not at the origin and the pivot is moved.

Negative 7330 pOkay, so Im writing a stock control program in Visual Studio 2010.  Im storing product codes and quantities for each location as ints in List type arrays.

Negative 7330 pI am attempting to convert some old VB6 code into java for my company. I have all of it done except for the formatting of the strings. In the old VB6 code they would use the TabN function to dictate where the string would be positioned on a line as it was being written to a text file. I have been looking for some way to duplicate this in any way with Java. I am attempting right now to figure out the String.format method, but Im slightly confused on how it functions. Is there any other function or any way I can set the absolute position of a string on a line in java One example is the first string is 15 characters long and the next string in the line needs to be at line position 50, while another string is 4 characters long and each string after that is supposed to be at position 19, 34, 41, 51, 59, 66, 76, 83, and 90.

Negative 7330 pAs a disclaimer I am new to this site and therefore, do not know very well how to ask questions.  Please dont be too harsh because I really am trying to just understand how some of these concepts work.  If i am missing understanding near the beginning, please just tell me that so I can start from there and not waste your time with the rest.  Here goes nothing.  Because I think my understanding might be flawed, I poised some questions about how heaps would act in different areas, and then tried to answer them.  p  pFirst, I would like help understanding how a random set of numbers added to an empty heap would look.  lets say for example, I have 9, 4, 5, 3, 2, 7, 8, 7.  After adding it to the heap, what would the heap look like I can visually understand this I think the 9 being the root, 4 being the first left child and so on and so forth, but since this isnt a tree specifically, and is a heap, would it sort the numbers by switching them see paragraph if my understanding is correct so that they are sorted in either min or max orderp  pNow lets say we removed the 9 from the heap I believe the 9 would be the root, how would we respond to this change and then what would then be put into the root  I think here if 9 is the root, we would take the next largest number and copy it into the slot of the nine, while if this was a min heap and we where just removing a node at the bottom, it would just be removed no problem.p  pAlong similar lines, what would a formula to get the parent of the heap item in the array I think I understand this,  If parent is at i, the left child would be at i2 and the right child would be at i21. And therefore going to find the parent, we would have to divide i2 to find the parent.  For example if we where at i7 the parent would be i3 because 3.5 would be truncated and if we where at point i6 the parent would also be i3.  From this example the child at i  7 would be right child of i  3 while i6 would be the left child of i  3.p  pIf my understanding of this is correct, then to reheapify after a new term has been added to the root I would compare the child to parent and if the child is larger, switch the terms. BUT I would need to compare the two children if there are two to see which one is bigger to decide which one needs to swap.  This would be for a max heap and would go the other direction for a min heap.p  pFinally, if I where to add the root element, how would it reheapifyp

Negative 7330 pIm working on a design of the pythonbased API. At the moment Ive met an issue with two divergent requirements. On the one side I would like to provide reliable way to cleanup APIrelated resources. Thus as I know the best way to do it is to use context managers likep  precode lib  class Clientobject   def enterself     return self    def exitself, exctype, excval, tb     docleanup    def method1self     pass    def method2self     pass   api user import mylib  with mylib.Client as client   client.method1   client.method2 codepre  pOn the other hand I would like to provide a way to seamlessly use my lib in interactive interpreter. But using compound construct like codewithcode or codetryexceptfinallycode in interpreter makes usage of interpreter not so groovy because codewithcodeblock is treated as a single statement. And its would be preferred to use single statement per single api method likep  precode interpreter session  gtgtgt import mylib gtgtgt client  mylib.Client ltclient object at ...gt gtgtgt client.method1 True gtgtgt client.method2 100 codepre  pSo, could I have any options here Definitely there is a way to provide different usage semantics for scripts and for interpreter, but I would like to use it as a last resort.p
Negative 7330 pstrongRequirementstrong  I have 4 servers  A,B,C,D. They all connect to data provider, get the data and persist it into mongodb for N mins.

Negative 7330 pIn my windows forms application, I have to execute a method in a thread. The timing of method to execute depends upon a Tick Event. So, every 5 seconds, the Tick Event occurs and inside it checks for the time elapsed between last execution and now. If the elapsed time  10 seconds, then only it executes the method creating a separate thread. But, the application should not execute the method, if the original thread has not completed its execution. In other words, the application executes the method in a thread and executes after 10 seconds once the thread completes its execution, not necessarily on the two ticks.p  pNow, the issue is So, I need to place a logic inside the code, that stops the tick until the thread completes its execution.p  pI was trying to solve it by disabling the timer control when the thread starts and enable it again when the thread completes its execution, but seems like it is not working. p  precodePublic Class Form1     Private lastRunDateTime As DateTime  111900      Private Sub Button1Clicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Button1.Click         Timer1.Interval  5000         Timer1.Enabled  True    End Sub     This method takes more than 5 seconds     Private Sub test         For value As Integer  0 To 10000             Console.WriteLinevalue         Next        Timer1.Enabled  True      End Sub        Private Sub Timer1Ticksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Timer1.Tick          If DateDiffDateInterval.Second, lastRunDateTime, Now gt 10 Then             Timer1.Enabled  False             lastRunDateTime  Now             Dim th  New Threading.ThreadSub test             th.Start          End If       End Sub   End Class codepre

Negative 7330 pThis jsfiddle  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmjmitcheavo5nnus39 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netmjmitcheavo5nnus39a  demonstrates the problem Im having, but I will explain here. I have a main view that has a codestartIntervalcode and codestopIntervalcode function. In the startInterval, I call a method that adds values to a stats array inside a model that I create in the codestartIntervalcode function with code codethis.model  new myModelcode. If I stop and then codestartIntervalcode again at which point the code runs again codethis.model  new myModelcode, its still the same array from the first press of the codestartIntervalcode button.  p  pFor example, if I press start, and the random number 3 gets added to the stats array in the codeaddToModelcode function, and then press stop, and then press start again which adds a 5 to the stats array, the array will actually have a 3, and a 5. You can see the values print to the screen in the jsfiddle if you press start and stop. p  pIn my real application, Ive tried to do things like setting the stats array to code[]code but i cant clear it. Ideally I wish to dereference the view from the model.p  precodestartInterval function      this.model  new myModel     this.model.intervalId             setIntervalthis.addToModel.bindthis, 1000  ,  stopInterval function      clearIntervalthis.model.intervalId     var modelstats  this.model.getstats   , addToModel function     var arr  this.model.getstats     var num  Math.floorMath.random  10  1      var view  new StatViewmodel this.model        arr.pushnum     this.model.setstats  arr   codepre  pAny ideas on a solutionp  pAlthough my code doesnt show it, the model is eventually getting added to a collection and then saved to a database, so if the only solution involves destroying the model please take that into consideration i.e. is there a way to destroy a model without removing it from a collectionp

This behaviour started since last update of Google 4.1.24.1672412.arm update 12 January 2015p  precodeprotected class SpeechRecognitionListener implements RecognitionListener      public void onBeginningOfSpeech                public void onErrorint error              if mIsStreamSolo            CAudioLibrary.unmute             mIsStreamSolo  false                   iferror  SpeechRecognizer.ERRORNETWORKerror  SpeechRecognizer.ERRORSERVER          codepre  p.....p  pI have examined logcat and found out that it gives many errors like this It is not my device specific, it gives the same error on my users devices also. Is there a problem on google site  If I revert google update, it works without giving these errors.

Negative 7330 pI have an HTML field which is supposed to display the first couple of lines of a text message that was sent tofrom you most recently, similar to messages on an iphone. I want max two lines of text, the end of the second line is cut off using ellipsis. I can only hold 45 characters per line the way its formatted. Preferably there would be a way to do word break properly but I havent found that yet either.p  pIm also planning on building this using ioniccordova so I cant rely on pure css, scss or any other webkit trickery so Im attempting to do this only using angular. Im really close but I cant get it.p  pMy solution is essentially taking my messages text, codemessage.textcode, and using codelimitTocode or the codeslicecode method to take the first 45 characters of the returned array text, then on a second line right below it, the next 45 characters after those first 45.p  precode                ltdiv classrow rowcentergt                     ltdiv classcol stylepadding0pxgt                         ltdiv stylegt                          message.text  limitTo 45 ltbr gt                          message.text.slice45,90                           message.text.length gt 45  ...                           ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt codepre  pI understand the problem here, which is that Im using the same set of results, in the first line Im getting the first 45, the second line Im getting the first 90, then from the end Im taking 46...this doesnt make sense I realize but I feel like Im close, any guidance appreciated.p  pEDIT I think I just figured it out, using slice changed above Now does anyone have an idea about how to do this wordwisep

Negative 7330 pIm a total noob when it comes to PHP, as Im sure youll discover once you read this question.p  pIm messing around and trying to learn, and Ive made a chat room using PHP. Im trying to add functionality so that a user can change which room they are in by using a dropdown box with some predefined rooms. I have a login page which asks for a username, password, and which room the dropdown box. The login page then directs to the index.php page which is where the rest of the chat code is at. The index page has a section that checks to see if the user has changed rooms. If they have changed, it displays a message in the OLD room to say that theyve left, and a welcome message in the NEW room.p  pThe issue that Ive run into is that when I log in, the room variable gets broken somehow. It puts me in a blank room. If I use the drop down box after that to change rooms, everything works fine.

Negative 7330 pI have an application written in Python that runs on OS X, forks itself and does some things. One of the things it does is provides a list of the network interfaces which is implemented using the codeSystemConfiguration.SCNetworkInterfaceCopyAllcode function. This works fine when the script does not fork itself, but when it does Python fails with a segmentation fault when that function is called. I do not believe that the issue affects older versions of OS X due to the fact that the code used to work prior to 10.10.p  pIve tried importing the SystemConfiguration module at different stages of execution, namely before the fork and after. Ideally it should be imported prior to the fork with the other standard imports at the top of the file.p  pExample to illustrate the problemp  precodeimport os import SystemConfiguration  def main     if os.fork         return     ifacerefs  SystemConfiguration.SCNetworkInterfaceCopyAll     printthis is never reached due to the segfault on OSX 10.10  if name  main     main codepre  pIncluded the full stack trace on a hrefhttppastebin.comQEshD5qr relnofollowPastebina.p

Otherwise it causes space to appear at the top and bottom of elements      that are clearfixed.   2.

Negative 7330 pIve been reverse engineering a dll i believe to contain malicious code using IDA pro, and Ive identified a very important subroutine. In order to facilitate unit testing, id like to reimplement the subroutine in my own application, but rewriting the entire codebase has proven both tedious and prone to error.  Ive already identified and rewritten the types involved in the subroutine, and was wondering if there was a way I could quickly extract the subroutine in native code and copypaste it into my application.p

Negative 7330 pI think its quite well put in the title already, but what Im trying to do, is have a template content from templateCache.get Ive tried to Dependency Inject templateCache to different parts of the app.configp  precode... ... .config[routeProvider, templateCache, functionrouteProvider, templateCache   routeProvider.     when,          template  function templateCache return templateCache.getmain.html     . codepre  pThis results in templateCache is not a function.p  pMy app.js is its own module and templates.js is linked in the index file after the app.js file. Template.js file is created by a Grunt task and it puts the content stuff  their repected templates. p  pI saw some question here that had templateCache iterated and the content from there put into templateCache in the app.run part so I quess my question is whether I can somehow use my template.js that uses app.run to put into the templateCache, or do I have to refactor my Grunt task to build it into a json object Any plnkr andor resources would help. Sorry for being vague.p

Negative 7330 pOut of a sudden I realized that the Ajax requests that I make synchronously work no more and the only thing left for me is to close the browser tab as it hangs forever. The problem is not with a particular request but with all synchronous Ajax requests in my web application. If I turn them to codeasynctruecode, then the problem gets solved. After some digging I found out that Kaspersky antivirus was blocking them. All the computers that I test the application on use Kaspersky for virusfighting purposes. I tried with all major browsers and all present the same problem. Now a few things to notep  ol liI didnt use to have this problem just a couple hours ago.li liThe application server also has Kaspersky running but AJAX sync request work normallywhich makes me come to a conclusion that the problem is with the responseli liIve put another simple test application  with AJAX sync request and they work normallyli liOther antivirus programs dont cause such a problem.li ol  pSo do you have any ideas what the problem might be Is it something that I need to ask in Kaspersky forum p

Negative 7330 pIm working with a team on a webapp that will use an existing database with client data, but has no user accounts setup. The goal is to have users perform an email lookup in the database to see if their info already exists, that way if we find them, we can tie the existing data to their new user account.p  pWed also like to implement OAuth so that users are able to login via facebook or google, but were a bit unsure on how to link these thirdparty accounts to our own. We can request the email back and check it against our DB assuming the user grants us access, but that would be a big assumption of them having the same email in our system as their other accounts. p  pGetting to the actual point, were curious as to how others have implemented this workflow. Would it be better to force the user to check for their email first when selecting one of those options or roll the dice with a lookup Should we hide the option to login via thirdparty and only allow them to associate a thirdparty account after they login so they would automatically login to our site assuming theyre logged in elsewhere Or would it be best to let them build a new account, and provide admin tools to link local data to an account after the factp  pSorry for the openended question, Im sure Ill get some downvotes here dont hate me, but Ive been scouring the internet for a while with very little to show for it, and I feel that the StackOverflow community is one of the best QampA resources out there love you guys. p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 7330 pThe ECMAScript6 codeiterator.throwerrcode method is often described as injecting an exception as though it occurred at the yield statement in the generator.  The problem is that the stack trace for this exception does not contain any reference to the fileline for the yield statement, or even the function that it is in.  Rather, the stack trace seems to only be generated when the exception object is emconstructedem, which is not inside the generator.p  pThe question is stronghow can I get the location of the offending yield statement, in a stack trace or otherwisestrongp  precodefunction oneofmanygenerators       ...     yield ajaxurl     lt what I need in the stack trace      ...   function outer      var iterator  oneofmanygenerators     iterator.next     runs to the first yield       inject exception at the yield statement     iterator.throwErrorerror    lt top of stack trace shows here  codepre  pThough this issue is not specific to Promises, they may make it easier to picture the problem.  In my case, I am using a task system with generators and promises.  The hypothetical function codeajaxcode returns a Promise, and if that is rejected then the error is converted into a throw at the yield statement using this mechanism.p  pThe stack traces in the debugger are pretty useless, because I cannot find a way to get the function, file, or line number for the yield statement where this injection is occurring.  Calling codeiterator.throwerrcode is treated like a rethrow, and does not get new stack information, so it only shows a location inside the codeajaxcode function which can be called from many places, and by throwing a new error in codeoutercode like in the example above, the same throw line shows for all errors.  Neither gives a hint as to what generator function was being executed for debugging the error.p  pI am using Chrome v42.p

Howwhere should I make this call  I feel like my graph component should call GraphActions.refresh when the state changes, but this is obviously a dispatch chain, so no go.  The only alternative I can find is to have WindowActions.stepBack call GraphActions.refresh.  But that means I have to pass in the new start and end values as well as tightly couple GraphActions to WindowActionsp  precodestepBack functionstart, end      Dispatcher.dispatchtype WindowConstants.Actions.STEPBACK     GraphActions.refreshstart, end  codepre  pIs this right  What do I do when I want to update a list component or other graph components drawing from the same WindowStore  Am I supposed to call those in stepBack too  What if I need the data loaded by GraphActions.refresh and I want to wait for refresh to finish  This feels too tightly coupled and messy.p  pPlease help.p

Ordernumber strongabc123strong in file1 is at position 1 but in file2 its at position 3 and it is coming after two ordernumber  strongskd109 and def234strong  respectively in file2. p  pOrdernumber strongdef234strong is coming after strongskd109strong in file2. p  pAnd ordernumber djkk09 and nknk323 are flipped. p  pstrongThe output of my program should look like thisstrongp  precode    abc123 is flipped by 2  ve sign because it came after      def234 is flipped by 0     skd109 is flipped by 2  ve sign because it came before      djkk09 is flipped by 1     nknk323 is flipped by 1 codepre  pNote Each file has more than million record in them.

Negative 7330 pAs Im relatively new to Java, im still not sure about the basic passbyvaluepassbyreference thing. Ive read this question on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions40480isjavapassbyreferenceorpassbyvalueIs Java passbyreference or passbyvaluea, which seems to have some very good answers.

I wrote this simple class to clear things a bitp  precodepackage Chap1     Created by user1 on 71815.   public class JavaTest1       private double balance      public JavaTest1double amt          balance  amt           public double getBalance          return balance           public void method1          JavaTest1 obj1  new JavaTest1300.00         System.out.printlnBalance in method1 before method2   obj1.getBalance         method2obj1         System.out.printlnBalance in method1 after method2    obj1.getBalance           public void method2JavaTest1 o          o.balance  100.00           public static void mainString[] args          JavaTest1 j1  new JavaTest1500.00         System.out.printlnBalance in main before   j1.getBalance          j1.method1         System.out.printlnBalance in main after    j1.getBalance        codepre  pWith this code, I get the output p  precodeBalance in main before 500.0 Balance in method1 before method2 300.0 Balance in method1 after method2  200.0 Balance in main after  500.0 codepre  pMy observations arep  ol liIn main, things get started with one codeJavaTest1code object codej1code, with a starting balance of 500. codej1code then calls codemethod1code.li liIn codemethod1code, another codeJavaTest1code object is created, with starting a balance of 300. codemethod1code then calls codemethod2code. li liIn codemethod2code, an object of type codeJavaTest1code is passed. This method then deducts 100 from the balance of the object reference that was passed to it. li liWhen I run the code, I see that the balance of the object created in codemethod1code is reduced to 200 in codemethod2code.li ol  pNow this is where my confusion lies. If strongobject references are passed as valuesstrong, then the balance deduction in codemethod2code should not have modified the object created in codemethod1code. But since it did modify the balance, doesnt it essentially say that strongobjects are always passed as referencesstrong, proving that both codemethod1code and codemethod2code operate on the same object. Otherwise, codemethod2JavaTest1 ocode should have created another object of type codeJavaTest1code with its reference being called codeocode.p
Negative 7330 pIm using the em tag on a web app to high light when a certain event happens and incasing the text in codeltemgtltemgtcode and using css to highlight the background green and display as a block so it creates a green section of text however, codeltemgtltemgtcode is adding space in between my lines, and Im not sure how to get rid of it.  codelineheightcode doesnt seem to work, and the spacing is fine without the codeltemgtltemgtcode brackets.p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pYoure right, I should have included the code.  I thought it would be an easy answer and after looking it over in the Element section of Development Tools, I didnt see any margins or padding that would cause it.  Ive figured out that it is because in my non  code, I put a  after each line, but when I incase the part I want in the  code, it effectively adds its own break at the end to go to the next line, so the extra spacing was because I left in , once removed, it worked fine.

Negative 7330 pI have created a treemap with zoom functionality. The treemap is colored based on the parent. Now when I click on any of the parent rectangles, it zooms in and shows all the children within it clearly. It is correctly displaying the children, however, I need to maintain the same color which I had used while clicking on the parent to zoom in as the parent remains the same. For instance Parent 1 has an orange color, parent 2 has a yellow color. Now when I click on parent 1 it should still show the children in orange color and not in any other color. It should be based on the legend provided.p  pAlso, another issue that I am facing is when I try to zoom out i.e. go back it shows me the parent name along with the children name which I do not want. I just want to see the children name something that we see when we first time open the treemap. For instance  first time when we open the treemap, I am able to see multiple rectangles and each rectangle having some text that text is the child name. Now when i zoom in and then come back, in the left hand corner of each colored rectangle  there are 9 colored rectagles  Parent you can see additional text which is the parent text. How can I get rid of that.p  pHow do we restrict the treemap to only one level of navigation, mine takes up to 2 levels.p  pPlease find below link to get more details about my treemap. a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orggeetanjaliranad78c3f81eabf5f8ca7ac relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orggeetanjaliranad78c3f81eabf5f8ca7acap  pRegardsp
