Positive 25902 pI am trying to strongmeasurestrong size of a styled string block from single nonmain thread.p  pAFAIK, codeNSAttributedStringcode is a part of Foundation, so it is fine to use them from single nonmain thread.p  pBut when I tried to set paragraph style line break mode, alignment, etc. I realized that I have to use codeNSParagraphStylecode class. And the class is a part of UIKit. That means the class is not allowed to use in nonmain thread by default. I tried to find some mention about using this class from nonmain thread, but I failed.p  pMy last resort is measuring and drawing everything using Core Text, but I like to avoid it where possible.p  pCan I use this class codeNSParagraphStylecode from nonmain threadp
Positive 25902 pI have subclassed UIWebView to add custom UIMenuController functionality in and it was working pretty well up until iOS 9.

I am observing the codeUIMenuControllerDidHideMenuNotificationcode notification, and that is indeed being called right after the menu disappears, but I am having a hard time finding the cause of the dismissal.p  pI recognize that there are many different issues that could be lurking, but I am wondering if anyone has experienced something like this before Is there a way to track somehow the cause of the dismissalp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGDf8o.gif relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGDf8o.gif altenter image description hereap

Positive 25902 pI wonder if I can detect continuously changing pressure of user input on iPhone 6s.p  pWith simple touch its obvious, from the UIResponder you can hook into touchesBegan and TouchesMoved and youll have the coordinates every time when the user touches the screen and when moves hisher finger, you can have the current position on every update.p  pHowever, Im not sure how the new force property works. If you read the force in touchesBegan, wouldnt you get some minimal pressure value that was detected at the initiation of the touchp  pIs there a way to get update on the force value as it changes, just like the touchesMoved Maybe there is a method like forceChangedp
Positive 25902 pI have a codeUISplitViewControllercode. The master view shows an overview of the app for navigation, and the detail view is what the user will interact with 99 of the time.

Positive 25902 pIve recently realised that in my projects its often necessary to react to keyboard events, usually adjusting some layout or making some other changes. In order to achieve this I have to complete 3 steps each timep  ul liRegister a VC as an observer for keyboard notificationsli liCreate a couple of corresponding methods to handle notificationsli liFinally remove VC from observers list at appropriate time dealloc,willDissappear, etc. li ul  pI started to think, how can I make this steps into a simple reusable instrument.p  pThe most obvious solution is to subclass a UIViewController, add all three steps to it, and then just override handling methods. This will work, but its not very flexible. What if I want to stop observing at different point Another argument against a superclass is that most of my controllers already have 2 parent classes before UIViewController. One for scrolling management and another one for tableView management. Is this a good practice to have such a subclass tree Any disadvantagesp  pSecond solution that comes to mind is a EventManager class that takes blocks to complete event handling.

Positive 25902 pI have an codeiPadcode app that uses thousands of codeUITextFieldscode and codeUITextViewscode throughout it. When text is being entered into these elements, the iOS default codekeyboardcode is used. However, because my app does not provide codedictationcode support, it crashes whenever the user attempts to dictate. Some research into the subject has shown that it isnt possible to disable the codedictationcode feature on the default codekeyboardcode. p  pInstead, I found that it is recommended to use a change the type of codekeyboardcode to one that doesnt offer a codedictationcode option. The problem is that I have thousands of codeUITextFieldscode and codeUITextViewscode throughout my app, so manually going in and changing the keyboard type of each of these is unfeasible. My question is this is there a way to change the default codekeyboardcode used within an app p

Negative 25902 pFrom the man page on gitmerge, there are a number of merge strategies you can use.  p  ul lipemresolveem   This can only resolve two heads i.e. the current branch and another branch you pulled from using 3way merge algorithm. It tries to carefully detect crisscross merge ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast.pli lipemrecursiveem   This can only resolve two heads using 3way merge algorithm. When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for 3way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.pli lipemoctopusem   This resolves more than twohead case, but refuses to do complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branches.pli lipemoursem   This resolves any number of heads, but the result of the merge is always the current branch head. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches.pli lipemsubtreeem   This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.pli ul  pWhen should I specify something different than the default  What scenarios are each best forp

Negative 25902 pI have never done any testing in javascript. I know, I know. But the reason is that Ive never built big javascript applications before, so Ive never seen any reason for getting into testing.p  pBut now I figured its about time to get crackin.p  pThe only problem is that everywhere I go, every testing framework seems to rely on the fact that people already know emhowem to test with javascript, they only focus on why their testing framework is better than the next.p  pWhat I would like, is a very basic introduction to testing with javascript.

Negative 25902 pWe are building an ASP.NET MVC application which will be deployed behind a hardware load balancer that supports, among other things, caching.p  pOur proposal is to manually define which URL patterns should be cached by the load balancer. This will be quite an easy process for us as we have catalogue pages which are relatively static, then order pages which are not.p  pMust avoid using session state on cached pages, as the entire response is cached by the load balancer  this includes any cookies that are sent.p  pIdeally there would be an attribute which can be applied to controllers or action methods which allows selective use of session state, but there doesnt appear to be one. I realise that an approach like this would result in lost sessions if the use leaves the session zone  thats fine.p  pOther than reimplementing the entire ASP.NET MVC HTTP controller... any suggestionsp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 25902 pI have a WPF RichTextBox that I am typing some text into and then parsing the whole of the text to do processing on. During this parse, I have the absolute character positions of the start and end of each word.p  pI would like to use these character positions to apply formatting to certain words. However, I have discovered that the FlowDocument uses TextPointer instances to mark positions in the document.p  pI have found that I can create a TextRange by constructing it with start and end pointers. Once I have the TextRange I can easily apply formatting to the text within it. I have been using GetPositionAtOffset to get a TextPointer for my character offset but suspect that its offset is different from mine because the selected text is in a slightly different position from what I expect.p  pMy question is, how can I accurately convert an absolute character position to a TextPointerp

Negative 25902 pSorry if this makes no sense. Please comment if clarification is needed.p  pIm writing a small file upload app in web.py which I am deploying using modwsgi  apache. I have been having a problem with my session management and would like clarification on how the threading works in web.py.p  pEssentially I embed a code in a hidden field of the html page I render when someone accesses my page. The file upload is then done via a standard POST request containing both the file and the code. Then I retrieve the progress of the file by updating it in the file upload POST method and grabbing it with a GET request to a different class. The session apologies for it being fairly naive is stored in a session object like thisp  precodeclass session      def initself          self.progress  0         self.title           self.finished  False      def advanceself          self.progress  self.progress  1  codepre  pThe sessions are all kept in a global dictionary within my app script and then accessed with my code from earlier as the key. p  pFor some reason my progress seems to stay at 0 and never increments. Ive been debugging for a couple hours now and Ive found that the two session objects referenced from the upload class and the progress class are not the same. The two codes, however, are as far as I can tell equal. This is driving me mad as it worked without any problems on the web.py test server on my local machine.p  pEDIT After some research it seems that the dictionary may get copied for every request. Ive tried putting the dictionary in another and importing but this doesnt work. Is there some other way short of using a database to seperate the sessions dictionaryp

For this, I make the icon invisible when the touch event indicates this action.p  pThe problem is that the view visibility is accessed from different threads.

Ive now gotten a requirement that certain pages should be removed if theyre all blank for purposes of the question, I can check a boolean variable to know whether or not I need to remove the pages.

Maybe some knows this neverthelessp  pI want to compile Hector with Maven in Eclipse Branch 0.7.0 and Tag hector0.7.029 httpsgithub.comrantavhector.git. The mentionaed BranchTag are not the Master Branch, so requires a dedicated Checkout.p  pI have installed MavenMaven Plugin and the EGit Plugin for Eclipsep  pMy Problemp  p1.Maven Plugin allows to checkout directoly from a SCM like GitHub when installing the mavengitplugin this is not the same as egit plugin. I am now able to downlaod a Project directly from Github with the maven plugin. On Disk I find the Tag and Branch as Git files in the .git Directory. p  pBut the Problem is, the Version that is checkout out is the MASTER Branch. And I do not find an option to checkout the specific Branch and Tag directly within Eclipse. When clicking on TeamContextMenu I normally have all the EGit Options to checkout a specific BranchTag. But due to the fact the Project got downladed via the Maven Plugin it seems it is not regarded from Eclipse as an Git Repository. So klicking on Team where I normally have all my GitCommoands is more or less empty. I need to find a way to tell Eclipse that this Project is a GITEGIT managable project, so that I have the menu options to manage it.p  p2. Furthermore I want the downloaded Project to be completely SCMManaged via Git so that I can track my local changes to the files. Therefore all Egit Context Menu Stuff should be working for this checked out project.p  pIf someone knows how to do this, I would be very kind for any advicep  pThank you very much Jensp

Negative 25902 pIn languages that have goto, I like to create an error block at the end of a function after return and then when I do error checking within the function, I can just be concise and goto the error handler within each check. As I understand it, this is the one valid use of goto that isnt considered bad practice.p  pExample in pseudocodep  precode def example    if x goto error    do something    if y goto error    do something    If z goto error    do something    return   label error    log error occurred    begin      redirectto back    rescue      redirectto rooturl    end    return  end codepre  pAs you can see, in this case, my error block is as long as the function itself, and repeating it 3 times would double the size of my code, and not be very DRY. However, it seems that Ruby doesnt support goto, or at least if it does, as best as I can tell from looking on Google, its some sort of possibly joke library labeled evil.p  pbTherefore, what are people doing in Ruby in order to handle repeated error checking where the same result should occur in each errorbp

Sorry for being a noob but seems this is the only way I can come up with.p  pSo the sample file content is likep  precode1       Afghanistan      2       Albania  3       Algeria  4       American         5       Andorra  6       Angola   7       Anguilla         8       Antarctica codepre  pa list of countries, imagine it is a database table and each column is separated with tab. I already figured out a way to append tab to the end of each line, but now the problem is to add a number at the end of each line as well, and the number for each line is exactly same with its idthe first numberp  pI somehow think that it should be done with visual mode, but please tell me a working solution if you know. Any help is highly appreciated.p  pBest Regards, Hai Langp

Negative 25902 pWhat Im trying to do is create an asp.net page that runs a random number generator, displays the random number, and writes it to a text file.

Negative 25902 pIm am a new python programmer and this is my first time posting on here  So i started learning tkinter and using it and i made a program. in this program there is a button that when pressed executes a long function 67 lines. When this button is pressed the GUI freezes and stops responding. After searching the web and read that the answer to this is using threading. ok so after using threading the problem of freezing goes away but the function does not return a result even after 10 min And also i need it to return the results directly after pressing the button. And what makes me confused is that that function runs immediately when not in a tkinter GUI. Should i write a smaller function  Please help.

Negative 25902 pIve borrowed the Whereami code found in The Big Nerd Ranch iOS book and used it in the app Im writing.

Negative 25902 pFirst off my background Im new to Java coming over from Ruby. If that helps.p  pIm confused about how layout params work.  Im following a basic Hello World introduction to creating an Android App.  Step 1, extend the Activity class, and the onCreate method to access the XML layout.  Ok I get that.  p  pThen I create a layout say a RelativeLayout in the Main.XML.  So this is making use of the RelativeLayout class which extends the ViewGroup class, ok so far.  Then lets say I create a button inside this.  This is where my question starts.  If I look at the example I am following I see attributes being assigned to the button that belong to the RelativeLayout class i.e androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue.  These seem to be the layout params.  But why does this work  The button class seems to inherit from the View class.  Why can a button object accept attributes for the RelativeLayout object  Maybe my Ruby programming is confusing me..p  pThanksp  pUpdate For posterity sake thank you to Slothsberry for pointing out the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuideclaringlayout.html relnofollowXML Layoutsa link, which seems to describe the answer clearly in 2 sections the section on Attributes and on Layout Paramters.  The attributes section reads  p  blockquote   pEvery View and ViewGroup object supports their own variety of XML   attributes. Some attributes are specific to a View object for   example, TextView supports the textSize attribute, but these   attributes are also inherited by any View objects that may extend this   class. Some are common to all View objects, because they are inherited   from the root View class like the id attribute. And, other   attributes are considered layout parameters, which are attributes   that describe certain layout orientations of the View object, as   defined by that objects parent ViewGroup object.p blockquote  pThe layout parameters section though is perhaps the section that really answers this question.  Where it states p  blockquote   pEvery ViewGroup class implements a nested class that extends   ViewGroup.LayoutParams. This subclass contains property types that   define the size and position for each child view, as appropriate for   the view group. As you can see in figure 1, the parent view group   defines layout parameters for each child view including the child   view group.p blockquote  pThey give a nice diagram as well.  It seems that a beginning programmer needs to recognize that while Java classes are referenced, the XML acts more like a CSS sheet and that attributes are first computed in a nested fashion before being computed and carried over to their Java class counterparts.  Thats my current understanding anyways p

Negative 25902 pOn the tech talk 2011 I saw a speech about the new codeUIAppearancecode a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationuikitreferenceUIAppearanceProtocolReferenceReference.htmlprotocola.  There is not a lot of documentation out there yet. I will shortly summarize what I remember to explain where my question is coming fromp  hr  pstrongAbout codeUIAppearancecodestrongp  pSo far you had to customize EVERY navigation bar toolbar, etc. property in all your app view controllers. With the new appearance property you can do it in only one place for all navigation bars in your app. For instance if you want to customize your Navigation bar background image you could do it like thisp  precode[[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackgroundImage    [UIImage imageNamedMyImageName] forBarMetricsUIBarMetricsDefault]  codepre  pThis will set the background image of ALL navigation bars within your application. With the codebarMetricscode you specify whether you want the image to be used also in landscape mode or not.p  pIf you want to specify the appearance to be applied only in some view controllers there is also a method in the docs to control that by specifying where your objects are locatedp  precode[[UIBarButtonItem appearanceWhenContainedIn     [ABPeoplePickerNavigationController class], nil] setTintColormyNavBarColor] codepre  pAlso worth to mention is, if you have single customized instances, differing from your appearance settings, theses instances will not be effected by the appearance proxy.  p  hr  pstrongSome questionsstrongp  pstronga How do I know which properties of a class work with the appearance propertystrong For e.g. since codeUITableViewcode conforms to the UIAppearance protocol I was thinking I could do something likep  precode[[UITableView appearance] setBackgroundColormytableViewColor] codepre  pto manipulate the background color of all my table views, but I cant  p  pstrongb Is there a list of all classes that are manipulatable with the appearance propertystrong p  pstrongc At what point is the appearance customization being calledstrong I was hoping to make changes threw the appearance property at runtime, but unfortunately the changes arent taking place.  p

Negative 25902 pSorry, for the badly phrased title. I dont know much objectoriented PHP, so, I couldnt come up with a better title or an answer to my problem.p  pOk, so, I have something like thisp  precodeClass foo     var hello     function foo        Class customfoo extends foo     No Constructor  codepre  pNow, I wrote another class, lets call it codecustomclasscode and I want to use it in the codecustomfoocode class. But, I dont just want to use it in the codecustomfoocode class, I want it to be created as soon as the codecustomfoocode class is created.  p  pOrdinarily, I presume, you would just use the constructor for this, so something likep  precode Class customfoo extends foo     var custom     function customfoo         thisgtcustom  new customclass          codepre  pHowever, codecustomfoocode is a child class, so, I think the constructor would replace the constructor of the parent class, and I dont want that to happen. So, how can I make a class codecustomclasscode when codecustomfoocode is first started I guess, I could just write an arbitrary function and call it via some other function that I am sure gets executed early on, but it would be nice to at least know how to do the above.p

We previously had large mapreduce indexes which caused a similar issue.p  pIs there anything we can do perhaps via IIS to handle this better and stop the database performance degrading or becoming unusable Is the below a bugp  pI also note our ESENT Data file has become large 10Gb, perhaps unwisely due to a good number of fairly large docs stored in it previously. Is there any way to shrink this and make it smallerp  pnote I may edit this Q with a wrapup a bit later.p  pre Error reading RavenJArray from JsonReader.

Negative 25902 pI have a dilema with this, I am designing a project and basically it will have a baseclass  entityclass relationship where the entity class inherits from the baseclass. Now the base class is abstract and would have something likep  precodeabstract class MyAbstractClass  All this methods need to be implemented abstract int getHouseIdint id abstract string getHouseNameString s   codepre  pThen I would like to do something likep  precode public class MyChildClass extends MyAbstractClass      private int hId  0     private String hName        public int getHouseIdint id             ifid gt hId                   return hId                return id          public String getHouseNameString s              ifs.EqualshName                     return hName                   return s              AND YOU HAVE YOUR SETTERS SOMEWHERE HERE     codepre  pNow please excuse if sintax error, I just made it on the fly, my question is is it better to declare the variables in the abstract class and set and get stuff from there, or create the variables in the child class. I am confused by it, also if using it in the abstract class, how should they be declared in the abstract class, can I make them private there and add  properties to get the values, or it is better to do it in the child class. Basically I want to enforce a set of programmers to always use the abstract class as the functions that they HAVE to implement.. just a bit confused about the concept. I tried to google it but did not see many articles about variables and properties in an abstract class, maybe it should be used in the child class. Thank you for your help making me understand this.p
Negative 25902 pI am currently doing a research project and I am attempting to figure out a good way to identify ads given access to the html of a webpage. p  pI thought it might be a good idea to start with AdBlock. AdBlock is a program that prevents ads from being displayed to the user, so presumably it has a mechanism for identifying things as ads. p  pI downloaded the source code for AdBlockPlus, but I find myself completely lost in all of the files. I am not sure where to start looking for this detection mechanism, so I was wondering if anyone had any advice on where to start. Alternatively if you have dealt with AdBlock before and are familiar with it, I would appreciate any extra information. p  pFor example, if the webpage needs to be rendered in a real browser to use Adblock, there are programs that will automate the loading of a webpage so this wouldnt be a problem but I am not sure how to figure out if this is what AdBlock does in the first place. p  pNote AdBlock is written in Python and Perl p  pThanksp

Negative 25902 pSeemingly a vicious circle here. Ive just taken on a project that wont build. The reason it wont build is because I have a lot of does not exist in the current context errors with regards to controls that definitely would exist in the current context if I could view the forms in design mode. But I cant view them in design mode because they inherit from a class that inherits from Form that seems to be causing a problem.p  pNow, I thought the problem may have been that the class that inherits from Form may have been accidentally tampered with as it had the form icon in the solution explorer but should have been just the standard .cs file.

Negative 25902 pThis has been asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1992200displaydialogfromchromeextensionbeforea, but even after implementing that solution, problems remain.p  pSpecifically, Im running into the problem where the dialog is sometimes hidden behind a Flash video.  From reading responses to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestionstaggedwmodeother questionsa, it seems that this can be based on the embedded Flashs wmode being set to transparent and possibly other nonopaque values.  Since this a Chrome extension, I could have it automatically change that property before it gets loaded, but Im concerned that being transparent is the correct behavior for some sites.p  pAt the moment, Im leaning toward showing my dialog in a brand new tab that is automatically closed afterward, although it might be too awkward within the workflow.p  pI also still need to look at how other extensions handle dialogs to see if they were able to work around this issue.p

Negative 25902 pWhat I want to do is intercept assignments to the Text property on my control inherited from a TextBox. I the want to modify this text and have the modified text shown in the text box.  I aslo need the ability to return something different from what is shown in the text box when the property is read. In Win Forms I could do this by overriding the Text property as it was declared virtual. Obviously things are a bit different with dependency properties. One idea I had was to use OverridePropertyMetadata to have my own callback detect the property change and then call the original callback obtained with GetMetadata. This doesnt work as property changed callbacks are merged.  Id be interested if there is another way to do it which is specific to this property but I like to find out if it is possible override dependency properties in general.p  pMy application is a formatted text box when the text is set to 1000 say for a numeric format, the text box shows 1,000 but when you read the text you get back 1000 again the box will keep track of the un formatted text internally.

I would like to display the label when not zero, as otherwise it becomes hard to read.p  pIm trying to do something like thisp  precodeplotOptions     column      stacking normal,     dataLabels             enabled this.value  0  false  true,        color Highcharts.theme ampamp Highcharts.theme.dataLabelsColor  white    codepre  pBut this is not working. Ive tried using only this instead of value but also doesnt pick it up.  I havent been able to find a default option from the library that would allow me to do this without having to create custom code.p  pIve checked a few approaches, but the zeros are in one of the series. So i still want to present the label for the values that arent zeros for the group.p  pI think when one says this.y it takes the value of the entire group, and not the individual series...p  pAny suggestions Clearly Im doing something wrongp

Negative 25902 h1The Problemh1  pIm using a carousel, built using a combination of html and js, at the top of a website. For mobile visitors to the site Id like that part of the markup to be omitted so the images dont have to load, say for viewports less than 800px wide. What I have done is created a script at the bottom of the page that gets the browser width using jquery, and if the width is large enough, uses .prepend to place the entire markup for the carousel at the top of my body element.

Negative 25902 pI want to use Azure table to store data which is posted by users. And whenever a user post something to some other user it should give out a notification to this user. I have looked into Comet solution with PokeIn to see if there are a way for it. As Im new to this technique I would like to know the approach before writing the code.p  pMy though to tackle this problem so far is that you can make reverse ajax call to the server. And then at the server it will continuously check the database, with a whileloop, if something has changed. A sleep will be put so it wont overload the server. However this would introduce a lot of unnecessary checks to the database. I have asked a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11210953aspnethowtolongpollingwithpokeinherea earlier, about how to do long polling. And one of the answer suggested to use SqlDependency. However this is MS SQL specific. I want to know how to do it in Azure tables, if it is possible.p  pAny comments or answer to the general approach would be much appreciated.p

Negative 25902 pWhile evaluating 3rd party software Java framework utilising NIO we discovered that the throughput of the framework on Windows was about 50 of that on Linux. p  pAssuming that the there are some JVM or OS settings affecting Windows we set about to test simple computational Fibonacci, heapsort, strcat, etc. and object building across both platforms. In all cases the OSs are pretty much even. However when we performed a throughput test using a simple ServerSocket and Client Socket java.net jdk 1.7u5 we noticed that the Linux throughput can be as high as 10 times that of Windows especially for small messages 100 bytes.p  pOur immediate assumption was that the OS socket sendreceive buffer sizes are different and that they are playing a significant role in the throughput. Or that is related to TcpNoDelay being enabled on one OS and not the other. p  pOS Socket Option defaults are ...p  precodeLinux rcvBuf 43690, sndBuf86700, TcpNoDelay No Nagle On Windows7 rcvBuf 8192, sndBuf8192, TcpNoDelay No Nagle On codepre  pThe results are as follows ...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commAv5a.png altThroughput Test Resultsp  pThere are many questions that arise from these results though the following are the most challenging I simply cant explain and the most immediate as the  current target platform is Windows.p  ol lipWhy are Windows times for 100 byte messages with Nagle On regardless of buffer sizes almost 10 times slower than Linuxpli lipWhy are all Windows times for 100 byte messages regardless of Nagle setting or buffer sizes roughly 7000mspli lipWhy are all Windows time s the 100 byte messages regardless of Nagle setting or buffer sizes slower than their 1000 byte equivalent. I suspect this is related to efficient use of buffering andor Nagling OnOff though I dont fully understand it.pli ol  pWe performed additional tests on Windows where we start the message size at 50 bytes and increment 100 bytes after each 1 million messages. The results are strange and yet predictable between 50 and 400450 bytes the times are 7000ms, from 4501000 bytes they range from 5500ms  7000ms. Repeating this test over and over shows the same pattern. Its like the small messages require to be padded out to a specific size perhaps the MTU or other constraint. Again we are unable to explain this behaviour.p  pAny explanations or direction would be most appreciated.

Negative 25902 pWe have a Facebook App and for the most part it works well.  It connects to our CMS and our customers can post Facebook posts from the CMS directly to Facebook.  The idea here is that any employee can post to the company page in Facebook.   Our CMS has a built in approval process where the manager of the company can approve or deny the Facebook post.  The idea is that nobody has the username or password to the Corporate Facebook account.  With that being said we want the CMS itself to always be logged into Facebook so that when approvals take place they get sent to Facebook. p  pOur Problem  The CMS only stays connected for the life of the Token, 2hrs.  This defeats the purpose of having corporate social media workflow.  We dont want a Facebook prompt to pop up for any employees, they will not know the password to post to Facebook. Thats the idea. p  pOur Question How can we make it so that the CMS always has access to post. It seems like OpenAuth does not work for our scenario.  Is there a way to directly authenticate with the CMS rather than trying to deal with timeout tokensp

Negative 25902 pI have a background async Task that is fired from a button click. I have an codeIsBusycode property that is updated when the Task starts and within a finally block to account for cancellation or completion.p  pCurrently my button click event cancels the previous Task and starts a new Task when it is reclicked however since the cancellation of the first Task may linger past the start of the new one, a boolean codeIsBusycode indicator can become out of sync.p  pMy issue is how to deal with this situation.p  pMy current solution is not to update the boolean value directly but to use an integer that is incremented  decremented on start and completion  with the codeIsBusycode property returning codeBusyCount gt 0code. This however requires additions for thread safety, and does not feel like a good solution.p  pAnother thought was to store the Task when it is fired and only start the new task as a continuation of the first. This accounts for the cancellation issue, but forces a unnecessary delay however fractional and a contract for the caller rather than the task.p  pMy final thought was to create something like a BusyTokenSource class that hands out disposable BusyTokens that get added  removed from a threadsafe collection.. but this seems like overkill.p  pIs there a betterpropercommon way to handle this type of situationp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI ended up going with my last thought above, and wrote the BusyToken classes. This way I can simply wrap a function in a codeusingBusyTokenSource.GetTokencode and let the internal collection and codeDisposecode take care of the counting and busy status.  p

Negative 25902 pI was recently reading a hrefhttpwww.gamedev.netblog1140entry2250469dstructsvsclassesandasimpletemplateexample relnofollowthisa article on structs and classes in D, and at one point the author comments that p  blockquote   p...this is a perfect candidate for a struct. The reason is that it contains only one member, a pointer to an ALLEGROCONFIG. This means I can pass it around by value without care, as its only the size of a pointer.p blockquote  pThis got me thinking is that really the case I can think of a few situations in which believing youre passing a struct around for free could have some hidden gotchas.p  pConsider the following codep  precodestruct S      int pointer   void doStuffS ptrStruct       Some code here   int n  123 auto s  Sampn doStuffs codepre  pWhen s is passed to doStuff, is a single pointer wrapped in a struct emreallyem all thats being passed to the function Off the top of my head, it seems that any pointers to member functions would also be passed, as well as the structs type information. p  pThis wouldnt be an issue with classes, of course, since theyre always reference types, but a structs pass by value semantics suggests to me that any extra hidden data such as described above would be passed to the function along with the structs pointer to int. This could lead to a programmer thinking that theyre passing around an assuming a 64bit machine 8byte pointer, when theyre actually passing around an 8byte pointer, plus several other 8byte pointers to functions, plus however many bytes an objects typeinfo is. The unwary programmer is then allocating far more data on the stack than was intended.p  pAm I chasing shadows here, or is this a valid concern when passing a struct with a single reference, and thinking that youre getting a struct that is a pseudo reference type Is there some mechanism in D that prevents this from being the casep

Negative 25902 pHope that some one can give me a hint here.p  pI have a mysql Inno database with multiple tables related between them by foreign keys.p  pMy database has several Gigabytes of data now.p  pWhat I need to accomplish is backup my actual database ok mysqldump will take care of that for me, and I want to clean the database and add only the data for the last month for example, maintaining the integrity of all the rows that I want to restore. That is, imagine tables 1,2,3,4,5 I have about 50p  pTables 1 and 2 have new rows every minute, table 3 is a configuration table that feeds via foreign key in tables 1 and 2, and tables 4 and 5 these are not configurationbase tables are related by tables 1 and 2.p  pOk, I understand that I have to restore all my configurationbase tables and contained rows in order to assure integrity of related dependent tables and to be possible to use those configured values.p  pBut, how do I keep only the last month of every other table rows maintaining full integrity of the restored rowsp  pI thought in scripting something allied with the possible use of mysql binary logs.p  pAll of my id fields are autoincrement and at any time I should be able to restore the complete database in meltdown cases, or for big picture studymining.p  pThanks a million for any help givenp
Negative 25902 pJust like the topic says.  I have a DLL that provides a DAL, and Id like to get it to start caching in specific instances.p  pThe mentioned DLL is used both in an asp.net application, and a console application.p  pWhat Id like to do is use the System.Runtime.Caching namespace, but I want the caching to be purged at the end of every request for the asp.net environment.  The point is to make sure Im not going back to the DB multiple times for the same data over a single request, Im not looking for a generic caching mechanism for data that needs to survive over multiple requests.p  pI cant really seem to find anything on this particular aspect of System.Runtime.Caching.  What does it use in the asp.net context, and is there a way for me to get it to do thisp  pI realize I could just use a static member somewhere, but I would prefer not doing it that way since it isnt as future proof.p

Negative 25902 pIm currently writing a Backbone Marionette app which ultimately amounts to about 6 different screens or pages which will often times share content and I am unsure of how to best structure and access Regions.p  pI am using the appmodule setup described here stronga hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11070408howtodefineuseseveralroutingsusingbackboneandrequirejsStackOverflow question 11070408 How to defineuse several routings using backbone and require.jsastrong. This will be an application which will have new functionality and content added to it over time and need to be scalable and obviously as reusable as possiblep  pThe Single Page App Im building has 4 primary sections on every screen Header, Primary Content, Secondary Content, Footer.p  pThe footer will be consistent across all pages, the header will be the same on 3 of the pages, and slightly modified using about 80 of the same elementscontent on the remaining 3 pages. The morecontent region will be reusable across various pages.p  pIn my app.js file Im defining my regions like sop  precodedefine[viewsLandingScreen, viewsHeader, router], functionLandingScreen, Header, Router      use strict     var App  new Backbone.Marionette.Application      App.addRegions         header mainHeader,         maincontent mainContent,         morecontent moreContent,         footer mainFooter           App.addInitializerfunction options             App.oninitializeafter, function           if Backbone.History.started Backbone.history.start           return App  codepre  pNow, referring back to the app setup in the aforementioned post, what would be the best way to handle the Regions. Would I independently redeclare each region in each subapp That seems to be the best way to keep modules as independent as possible. If I go that route, what would be the best way to openclose or hideshow those regions between the subapps p  pOr, do I keep the Regions declared in app.js If so, how would I then best alter and orchestrate events those regions from subapps Having the Regions defined in the app.js file seems to be counterintuitive to keeping what modules and the core app know about each other to a minimum. Plus, every example I see has the appRegions method in the main app file. What then is the best practice for accessing and changing those regions from the subappp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 25902 pIm working on an iOS game.  I have access to mac, xcode, etc.  The issue is that my artists and designers do not.  I would like to give them an ipa and have them able to unzip, modify assets, and then rebuild and test the ipa without have to use a mac or xcode.  The ipa doesnt need to be installable on any iOS device other than their test device.  Is this possible  p  pI read a little bit about codesign that comes with xcode, but that appears to only run on a mac  are there alternatives  It looks like Marmalade and maybe UDK provides this functionality resigning on a pc to their users, but I dont want to use those engines.p  pUltimately I am simply looking for a way for an artist or designer to test out their changes without requiring them to rebuild the ipa from xcode or a mac  any ideas  Is there a system for allowing artists or designers to add files to an iDevice that an app can access to self patch its assetsp

Negative 25902 pI have a dynamically generated spreadsheet.  I would like to be able to allow the viewer to go to a different sheetcell when a cell is clicked on. Im having trouble figuring out a good way to do this.p  pGoing to the new cell is fairly easy codeSpreadhseet.setActiveSheetSpreadsheet.setActiveRangecode work fine.  My thought was to encode the link destination in the contents of the source cell, and then write a script to follow the link.p  pI tried using images or drawings.  But there were two problems with this while images can be inserted programmatically, I did not see a way to programmatically associate a script with them.  And the called script does not have an associated event tied to it, so there is no way to see what cell the user clicked clicking an image does not set the active cell.p  pI thought about using codeonEditcode.  This almost works, but codeonEditcode is only triggered on changes not selection so the user actually has to modify the cell in order to link.  When testing I tended to zap the contents of the cell by accident with codeonEditcode.p  pI tried making a menu item, and in the menus script get the active cells contents to determine where to go to.  This worked but was a bit more difficult for the user than I was hoping for.p  pI was hoping someone would have a creative solution to this problem.p  pThanksp

Negative 25902 pI am basically getting data from various APIs and using PHP to put them together  like a web mashup. I am currently using 4 foreeach statements to insert the gathered data into their individual arrays.

Negative 25902 pIm trying to write an implementation of Kruskals Algorithm using disjoint sets.  I think I have it nearly working, but I cannot seem to make a piece of the code work right.

Here is the code Im usingp  precodepublic static boolean difSetsint index1, int index2, ArrayListltNodegt sets[], Node nodes[]      int setnum1  0     int setnum2  0     forint i  0 i lt nodes.length i              forint j  0 j lt sets[i].size j                      ifnodes[index1].getX  sets[i].getj.getX ampamp nodes[index1].getY  sets[i].getj.getY                 setnum1  i             ifnodes[index2].getX  sets[i].getj.getX ampamp nodes[index2].getY  sets[i].getj.getY                 setnum2  i                   ifsetnum1  setnum2         return false     else         return true  codepre  pA little info this method is determining whether or not the two nodes are already in the same set.  The nodes array contains all of the points on the graph Node is a class that just stores the x and y values and can retrieve them.  Sets is an array of ArrayLists of nodes.  At the start of the problem, every node will be in an ArrayList by itself by the end, they should all be in the same ArrayList.  Indexes 1 and 2 correspond to the node in the Nodes array.p  pUnfortunately, this code does not seem to be giving me the right output Ive been staring at it for over an hour and I cant figure out what the problem is, so I was hoping someone here could help me out.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 25902 pI have a situation where I have nested divs. I have a parent div that has an onclick event and a few divs inside that are being dynamically populated.  Im given to understand that through bubbling, the onclick event should propagate up through the DOM, triggering the onclick event in all parents.  All of the research I have done has shown a bunch of people who are trying to PREVENT this, whereas I cant get it to work.  The only way I can get the onclick to work, is to click near the edges of the div, presumably where the child divs dont exist, and Im clicking directly on the parent.p  pIve included the applicable code below.  There can be as many as 9 of these, socalled widgets on the page, but I have removed all code except that referencing the first widget.p  pUpdate When I try to pull everything out of the JavaScript function, and put it directly in to the HTML code, it works as I would expect. However, doing this would force me to drop desired functionality, so Im going to try to avoid that workaround.p  pThere is a new fiddle below that shows essentially what Im going for, even though the events are not calling the JS functions as I would expect.p  pUpdate 2 I have created a fiddle 5 below that mimics the response Im seeing in the code.  When using the fiddle, youll notice that no alert is given when clicking in the center of the div, but when you click near the outer boundaries of the div, you finally get a response.p  pPROBLEM SOLVEDp  pPer Racheets answer below, this problem has been solved.

Negative 25902 pFor the context of a soft real time system that should not pause for more than 200ms, Were looking for a way to have an advance warning before a Full GC is imminent. We realize we might not be able to avoid it, but wed like to fail over to another node before the system stalls.p  pWeve been able to come up with a scheme that will provide us with an advance warning, ahead of imminent full GC that may cause the system to stall for several seconds which we need to avoid.p  pWhat weve been able to come up with relies on CMS free list statistics codeXXPrintFLSStatistics1code. This prints free list statistics into the GC log after every GC cycle, including young GC, so the information is available at short intervals, and will appear even more frequently during intervals of high memory allocation rate. It probably costs a little in terms of performance, but our working assumption is that we can afford it.p  pThe output to the log looks like sop  precodeStatistics for BinaryTreeDictionary  Total Free Space 382153298 Max   Chunk Size 382064598 Number of Blocks 28 Av.  Block  Size 13648332 Tree      Height 8 codepre  pIn particular, the maximum free chunk size is 382064598 words. With 64bit words this should amount to just below 2915MB. This number has been decreasing very slowly, at a rate of roughly 1MB per hour.p  pIt is our understanding that so long as the maximum free chunk size is larger than the young generation assuming no humungous object allocation, every object promotion should succeed.p  pRecently, weve run a severaldayslong stress tests, and have been seeing that CMS was able to maintain maximum chunk sizes upward of 94 of total old region space. The maximum free chunk size appears to be decreasing at a rate of less than 1MBhour, which should be fine  according to this we wont be hitting full GC any time soon, and the servers will likely be down for maintenance more frequently than full GC can occur.p  pIn a previous test, at a time when the system was less memory efficient, weve been able to run the system for a good 10 hours. During the first hour, the maximum free chunk size has decreased to 100MB, where it stayed for over 8 hours. During the last 40 minutes of the run, the maximum free chunk size has decreased at a steady rate towards 0, when a full GC occurred  this was very encouraging, because for that workload we seemed to be able to get a 40 minute advance warning when the chunk size started a steady decline towards 0.p  pstrongMy question to youstrong assuming this all reflects a prolonged peak workload workload at any given point in time in production will only be lower, does this sound like a valid approach To what degree of reliability do you reckon we should be able to count on the maximum free chunk size statistic from the GC logp  pWe are definitely open for suggestions, but request that they be limited to solutions available on HotSpot No Azul for us, at least for now. Also, G1 by itself is no solution unless we can come up with a similar metric that will give us advance warning before Full GCs, or any GCs that significantly exceed our SLA and these can occasionally occur.p

Negative 25902 pIm having an issue when constructing random forest models using caret.  I have a dataset of about 46k rows and 10 columns one of which is the optimization target.

My code for each of the listenersbuttons looks something like the followingp  precodelistenTosolve,comb11,comb12,comb13,comb14,comb15,comb16,comb17,comb18,comb19,comb21,comb22,comb23,comb24,comb25,comb26,comb27,comb28,comb29,comb31,comb32,comb33,comb34,comb35,comb36,comb37,comb38,comb39,comb41,comb42,comb43,comb44,comb45,comb46,comb47,comb48,comb49,comb51,comb52,comb53,comb54,comb55,comb56,comb57,comb58,comb59,comb61,comb62,comb63,comb64,comb65,comb66,comb67,comb68,comb69,comb71,comb72,comb73,comb74,comb75,comb76,comb77,comb78,comb79,comb81,comb82,comb83,comb84,comb85,comb86,comb87,comb88,comb89,comb91,comb92,comb93,comb94,comb95,comb96,comb97,comb98,comb99   reactions       case ButtonClickedsolve gt     ...[working code for solve function]...    codepre  pThe combs are the exhaustive 81 ComboBoxes and the solve is the button that solves the whole puzzle. If I get rid of all but one of the listenerreaction blocks of code, clicking the remaining button works perfectly. If I try to include two or all of the listenerreaction code blocks, then every button causes ALL functions to be performed, which is clearly confusing and undesirable.p
Negative 25902 pI have a question regarding shared connections. I have tried for many weeks to solve this problem and have tried many different things like PDO connection, getConnetion you name it. But I still dont get it to work. What I want to do is to create a connection to my database strongONCEstrong and then not have to declare it again. In PHPUnit you have the setUp and tearDown functions that I am acquainted with. Basically I would like to declare the database connection in the setUp so that before each test there will be a connection to the database which is needed to execute the unittests. At the moment I am forced to declare a new connection to the database within each function to get it to work. Otherwise I get error messages stating that I have an undefined variable mysqli wihtin each function or it may say call to a member function query on a nonobject. This is my codep  precodeltphp  include functions.php  class Test extends PHPUnitFrameworkTestCase   protected function setUp mysqli  new mysqlilocalhost, usrname, password, db  public function testCheckbrute mysqli  new mysqlilocalhost, usrname, password, db  LessThanFive  checkbrute200, mysqli thisgtassertFalseLessThanFive  FiveFailedLogins  checkbrute201, mysqli thisgtassertTrueFiveFailedLogins   public function testLogin mysqli  new mysqlilocalhost, usrname, password, db AccountIsLockedFalse  Loginxxxx,xxxx, mysqli thisgtassertFalseAccountIsLockedFalse  NoUserExists  Loginxxxx,xxxxx, mysqli thisgtassertFalseNoUserExists   protected function tearDown mysqli  new mysqlilocalhost, usrname, password, db  mysqligtqueryDELETE FROM loginattempts WHERE userid IN 200, 201 mysqligtqueryDELETE FROM members WHERE id IN 200, 201   gt codepre  pAny concrete simple solutions that dont require much refactoring or time This is the code snippet that I dont want to keep writing within each function p  precodemysqli  new mysqlilocalhost, usrname, password, db codepre

Negative 25902 pIm trying to figure out the correct way to map my three entities together.

Im reading this page a hrefhttpdocs.doctrineproject.orgenlatestreferenceassociationmapping.html relnofollowhttpdocs.doctrineproject.orgenlatestreferenceassociationmapping.htmla but I dont see one thats like mine, where I have a third entity to represent the join table, because it has a specific property that needs to be included the num.

Negative 25902 pWhat is the best approach for making data wait for administrator confirmation before saving it in a database in Java EE web application after getting it the data from an mobile phone client through a REST web service p  pI think its not a good idea to save the data in the application scope as it can use a lot of memory and it can take a lot of time for the administrator to confirm the storage of the data in the database which with a eventually huge amount of data can decrease the performance of the web app in the meanwhile. p  pWhat do you think p  pThanks in advance for your suggestions.p

Negative 25902 pIts a bit of a newbie question, but I was wondering what the best way of making a class would be. As far as I can tell, there are two ways of making a class in C that will lead to different results. I can create a class in a new tab in visual basics.

Negative 25902 pI am having difficulty trying to correctly program my application in the way I want it to behave.p  pCurrently, my application as a Java Servlet will query the database for a list of items to process. For every item in the list, it will submit an HTTP Post request. I am trying to create a way where I can stop this processing and even terminate the HTTP Post request in progress if the user requests. There can be simultaneous threads that are separately processing different queries. Right now, I will stop processing in all threads.p  pMy current attempt involves implementing the database query and HTTP Post in a Callable class. Then I submit the Callable class via the Executor Service to get a Future object. p  pHowever, in order properly to stop the processing, I need to abort the HTTP Post and close the databases Connection, Statement and ResultSet  because the Future.cancel will not do this for me. How can I do this when I call cancel on the Future object Do I have to store a List of Arrays that contains the Future object, HttpPost, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet This seems overkill  surely there must be a better wayp  pHere is some code I have right now that only aborts the HttpPost and not any database objects.p  precodeprivate static final ExecutorService pool  Executors.newFixedThreadPool10 public static FutureltHttpClientgt uploadfinal String url      CallableTask ctask  new CallableTask     ctask.setFilelargeFile     ctask.setUrlurl     FutureltHttpClientgt f  pool.submitctask This will create an HttpPost that posts largefile to the url     linklist.addnew tupleltFutureltHttpClientgt, HttpPostgtf, ctask.getPost storing the objects for when I cancel later     return f    This method cancels all running Future tasks and aborts any POSTs in progress public static void cancelAll      System.out.printlnChecking status...      for tupleltFutureltHttpClientgt, HttpPostgt t  linklist          FutureltHttpClientgt f  t.getFuture         HttpPost post  t.getPost         if f.isDone              System.out.printlnTask is done          else              if f.isCancelled                  System.out.printlnTask was cancelled              else                  while f.isDone                          f.canceltrue                         try                              Thread.sleep5000                          catch InterruptedException e                              e.printStackTrace                                                  System.out.printlnAborting Post                         try                              post.abort                          catch Exception ex                              System.out.printlnAborted Post, swallowing exception                              ex.printStackTrace                                                                        codepre  pIs there an easier way or a better design Right now I terminate all processing threads  in the future, I would like to terminate individual threads.p

When I write a windows application, there is a message loop which passes received windows messages e.g. WMSIZE, WMMOVE, etc. to handlers.p  pSome frameworks e.g. WinForms, WPF, MFC do not require applications to directly access the message loop, but instead automatically route events such as key presses and mouse clicks to their appropriate handlers.p  pNow I am working on web applications using ASP.NET. Does there exist a similar event routing mechanism in ASP.NET How does it work If a client side user click a button on the web page, how does ASP.NET find the appropriate handler to hande the OnClick eventp

Id like to automate this because currently, when I use the a hrefhttpmojo.codehaus.orgwas6mavenplugin relnofollowWAS plugin for Mavena, it seems to uninstall and reinstall the application completely, and so I have to go through the admin console every time the code changes and the application is redeployed. If I could have the class loader settings built in to the deployed EAR, work would go much faster.p  pFrom what I can tell, class loader configuration is controlled in a RADmanaged file, deployment.xml which is located in my EAR projects METAINFibmconfig folder. I am guessing that I can include this directory structure in my EAR and it will work fine when its deployed to WebSphere, but Im more concerned about the contents of this file. It looks something like thisp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltappdeploymentDeployment xmiversion2.0 xmlnsxmihttpwww.omg.orgXMI xmlnsappdeploymenthttpwww.ibm.comwebsphereappserverschemas5.0appdeployment.xmi xmiidDeployment1460348645719gt   ltdeployedObject xmitypeappdeploymentApplicationDeployment xmiidApplicationDeployment1460348645719 startingWeight10 warClassLoaderPolicySINGLEgt     ltmodules xmitypeappdeploymentWebModuleDeployment xmiidWebModuleDeployment1460348645719 startingWeight10000 uriMyWarProject1.wargt     ltmodules xmitypeappdeploymentEJBModuleDeployment xmiidEJBModuleDeployment1460348645719 startingWeight5000 uriMyEJBProject1.jargt     ltmodules xmitypeappdeploymentWebModuleDeployment xmiidWebModuleDeployment1460348645720 startingWeight10000 uriMyWarProject2.wargt     ltclassloader xmiidClassloader1460348645719 modePARENTLASTgt    ... codepre  pAll of the modules in the application have IDs such as codeEJBModuleDeployment1460348645719code, and Im guessing these were created when the application was originally published to WAS via RAD. If I give the new Mavenized project to a new developer, would they be able to use this codedeployment.xmlcode file or are there parts of it that are specific to a particular WAS instance that are usually managed by RADp  pAlso, if I add more modules to the application later on, how would I generate new module IDs with Maven Can I just make up an ID, like codeEJBModuleDeployment123code or is this something that really should be managed by RADWAS I was also wondering if I could write a Jython script to do this and somehow integrate that with Maven, but Im not sure if that would work or if its even necessary.p

While setting up the 2 threads, the plugin dll is dynamically loaded twice via loadlibrary  one for each thread and the exported functions are given to the thread. Note because its the same DLL with the same filename, the  DLL is loaded only once into my application and just the reference count of the loaded dll goes to 2.p  pEach workerthread starts, calls CoInitializenil to initialize the com system because i want to use ado components and then creates its  own dllinternal object via the dllfunction createobject and then calls runobject with the returned instancepointer as parameter.p  pNow, the code inside runobject uses adoconnection  adoquery components to read from a database.p  pThe adocomponents are created inside the workobject and nothing is shared between the 2 threads... no global vars used. p  h2The problemh2  pI get strange random accessviolations while the 2 objectinstances, each on its own thread, use their own ado components to read from the DB...p  pBoth threads start to read some Databaserows.

Since the models are independent, I can use OpenMP threads to parallelize the model fitting, as follows version 2p  precodeint mainint argc, char argv    ...   int numthreadsompmaxnumthreads   int c pragma omp parallel for privatec   forint t0 tltnumthreads t          assuming nmodel divisible by numthreads...            cstart  tnmodelnumthreads1       cend  t1nmodelnumthreads      forccstart cltcstop c          ...         result  doModelFitc, ...         ...           codepre  pWhen I run version 1 on the host machine, it takes 11 seconds and VTune reports poor parallelization with most of the time spent idle.  Version 2 on the host machine takes 5 seconds and VTune reports great parallelization near 100 of the time is spent with 8 CPUs in use.  Now, when I compile the code to run on the Phi card in native mode with mmic, versions 1 and 2 both take approximately 30 seconds when run on the command prompt on mic0.  When I use VTune to profile itp  ul liVersion 1 takes the same roughly 30 seconds, and the hotspot analysis shows that most time is spent in kmpwaitsleep and kmpstaticyield.  Out of 7710s CPU time, 5804s are spent in Spin Time.  li liVersion 2 takes fooooorrrreevvvver... I kill it after running a couple minutes in VTune.  The hotspot analysis shows that of 25254s of CPU time, 21585s are spent in [vmlinux].li ul  pCan anyone shed some light on whats going on here and why Im getting such bad performance  Im using the default for OMPNUMTHREADS and set KMPAFFINITYcompact,granularityfine as recommended by Intel.

Negative 25902 pI have tried reading about javascript hash maps a lot including on stackoverflow. Many people seem to suggest how to create and use hash maps as well. p  pMy question is more fundamental, are javascript hash maps lookups really O1. I was told by a coworker once that Javascript does not have any hash map implementation so internally the engine will still iterate through the set for you and when it finds a match it will show it. p  pNow this may vary from engine to engine but am curious from a performance perspective if key value pairs are better over just iterating and matching.p

Negative 25902 pI have a cloudweb service that is written in ASP.NET that will communicate with many embedded devices that I am working with.  Our embedded devices are in house, and they run a bare bones OS and the majority of our code is written in C that runs on them.p  pTo work behind in enterprise environments and firewalls, communication happens via HTTP between the web service and the embedded devices necessary requirement.  Now, Im trying to decide on communication format between the two.  The top two that I can think of arep  ol lipstrongJSONstrong  The web service and embedded device communicate via JSON.  This simplifies processing at the web service, as I can create a Model that matches the JSON format, and the controller can easily cast this data in to the class.  It is easily accessible for the web service, and JSON is very flexible it is easy to add new fields and data to any message.  The downside is that JSON parsing on an embedded device seems expensive, and the amount of data bytes transferred can be high since you spell out every single key name and its data in the payload.  pli lipstrongBinary Structs amp Castingstrong Alternatively, I imagine that I can create a well defined structure for the messages between the web service and embedded devices, passing binary data that is cast in to structures.  The benefit is that it seems relatively easy to process on both sides, especially on the embedded side where casting the memory is less expensive than processing JSON.  The downside of this is that it is less flexible.  It is more difficult to change the data, add fields postdeployment, etc.  Of course, you have to be careful with endianess also.pli ol  pI was wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences in designing something like this.  Whether it is better to go with JSON or something like binary data with casting.p

Negative 25902 pIn a spring mvc application using hibernate and jpa, I have a query that needs to return all the records whose date falls within a specified day.

So that I can find the time in which each frame fall using the frame number X sampling rate  the overlap will give the actual time for the frame. eg. 1x20ms  20ms and the next frame would be at the time 2x2040 but will have to consider the overlap here so it will be 30 if 50 overlap.p

Now, this method works fine if the GPS reception is good enough and we have sufficient accuracy. As soon as the accuracy of the acquired coordinates becomes worse, the points start to deviate from the real location and all this error gets integrated into the total distance.  Is there a function in android or a separate java library that automatically filters the error and fits the right pointstrack to a set of raw GPS measurements and thus obtains an accurate estimate of the distance traveled How would one go about this problem if such a library does not exist See the picture below for reference. The method provided in Android and is being used now is shown by the blue line. It calculates distances separately between subsequent coordinates. Because of the error, the distance is not correct.

Negative 25902 pI have a window with a content view that does several things, including managing an iOS like navigation controller.p  pThe windows content view front most view is an invisible custom view set here to manage drag n drop all over the window, called DragNDropView.p  pNow I want to manage the swipe gesture to navigate left swipe only  in the navigation controller. Unfortunately the DragNDropView catches the gesture if I implement voidswipeWithEvent and set acceptTouchEventsYES on it, and I dont want that since I want the views behind it to catch it, so of course I set acceptTouchEvents to NO on the DragNDropView.p  pIm suprised the gesture event does not go down the view hierarchy as the views below do have their acceptTouchEvents set to YES when the front most view has acceptTouchEvents set to NO.p  pIf the front most view does not handle the gesture, the gesture event is not passed to the views behind it gestures handling seems to be in NSResponder, so I even expect my NSViewController subclass to handle it, but it seems I cant.p  pCan any one help me understanding the problemp

Negative 25902 pI have been learning different programming languages Java, C, PHP and ObjectiveC, and looking for a standard way of creating realistic applications using those languages. Recently, I found an excellent sample application using asp.net mvc named MVC Music Store from this site a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsmvcmusicstoremvcmusicstorepart1 relnofollowhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsmvcmusicstoremvcmusicstorepart1ap  pIt really helps me in creating an app in a standard way by putting everything of asp.net mvc into an realistic application, instead of creating some unrealistic or boring sample app like hello world or stuff like that. Now, I just wonder if there is any sample tutorials apps out there  similar to this app MVC Music Store, but using different languages or framework like Java Spring or Zend or CodeIgniter framework to guide the learners of putting everything into a realistic app Thank you so much.p  pEditp  pActually, I have created some realistic projects using Java SE, Java EE, ASP.NET, ObjectiveC iOS and PHP. The thing is I just want to compare my style of programming with the professionals in order to improve my understanding. And Ive seen not only in tons of books, but also in the university, they just teach the learners of how to do the small thing in each lesson, but do not teach them of how to put everything together into a big realistic project which I think can influence the rest of the learner codings life. p  pI agree that there are a million samples out there, but as far as I know, there are only 3 sites that teach the learners to put every lesson into one realistic project thenewboston a hrefhttpthenewboston.orglist.phpcat51 relnofollowhttpthenewboston.orglist.phpcat51a, TutsPlus site for building eCommerce with Laravel framework and the site I mentioned above. Hence, I think wasting of time is when the learners study every lesson, but do not know of how to apply them into a realistic project.p

Negative 25902 pIm having an issue with the events and the calendar appointments. Long story short, I have auser in Sydney creating an event in Rome so the UTC of the event will be the Sydney one 10, the user will specify the city and the timezone Rome 1. When someone decides to join the event in Rome from Moscow 4 I want him to see the time when the even will happens. So if the even is from 900 to 1100 in Rome time, the user should see 1200 to 1500 3 in his calendar. My problem is that in the database the date is saved as UTC 900  1100 but starting from an offset of 10 the Sydney one where the user who created the event is, and beside the city and some offset specified by this user I dont know how to fix the date. If i Run an ignorant conversion from UTC i will obtain 300  500AM since Moscow has an offest of 4 while Sydney 10. My idea was to check the localtimezone, get the offset from the data that the user put in to the system he will specify the city and 1 for example If i do the subtraction manually Sydney is 10, Rome is 1 i subtract 9 hours so will be 000 to 200Am I convert that time to utc and from there i should be able to move it where i want, but in that case probably the daylightsaving will break the thing since im not able to determine if the area where the city is in daylightsavings or not.p  pAnyone has ideas over thisp
Negative 25902 pI have a web based application which sends messages to a client from the server every time some action has been performed in the backend.

Negative 25902 pIm writing tests for a presenter in a modelviewpresenter pattern. Ive mocked the view and testing the presenter. What Id like to do is perform some piece of code when a mocked method is being called in the view.p  pTo elaborate, the view sends and save clicked event to the presenter, the presenter then tells the view to save changes in the form after which the view commits the changes from the UI components to the model. Then the presenter can proceed to do whatever it wants in the with the model. Since the view is now mocked, it will not make any modifications to the model. So what Id like to accomplish is that when saveChangeInTheForm is called in the mock, I will simulate the views behavior and change the models content.p  pCan this be accomplished using Mockito What I have now is...p  precodeMockito.doNothing.whenview.saveChangeInTheForm codepre  p.. and ideally Id like to replace doNothing with doMyCustomThingp

As such, typing a character into an edit text can result in the character being placed somewhere different strongusually before or after the cursor indicated positionstrong. Also, when the cursor is placed inside of or next to a word, that word is often offset slightly.p  pHere is an example of the phenomenonp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0RKvY.png altenter image description here p  pNotice the words moving position from picture to picture, and in the second example the cursor indicates that it is before the codeicode but is in fact before the codeecode two indexes to the right.p  pHere is the codeEditTextcode element of this codeViewcode in the XMLp  precodeltEditText     androidididhazardobstext                   androidlayoutwidth0dp     androidlayoutheight0dp     androidlayoutbelowidhazardobservation     androidlayoutalignLeftidhazardobservation     androidlayoutalignRightidhazardobservation     androidlayoutaboveidfinalisehazard     androidlayoutmarginTop5dp             androidbackgrounddrawablewhitebackselector     androidhintRecommendation Text     androidtextSize9sp     androidgravitystart     androidpaddingLeft5dp     androidenabledfalse gt codepre  pAs you can see, it is inside a codeRelativeLayoutcode, and has a custom blank white background with some subtle shading around the edge.

This could mean that you have incorrectly nested   elements  such as a style element in the body section instead of   inside head  or two elements that overlap which is not allowed.   One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML   documents. Due to HTMLs rules of implicitly closed elements, this   error can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTMLs   selfclosing tags for meta and link in the head section of a   HTML document may cause the parser to infer the end of the head   section and the beginning of the body sectionp blockquote  pDoes it means it requires it to enclosed within the  tag of an  or it is not advisable to write css within the codes of an component p  pAny other ways to do itp

Negative 25902 pI am currently developing an application that validates signature certificates like in a pdf with OCSP or CRL. These will most likely be leaf certificates, without the entire chain. Getting the url to either validation services proved simple enough. p  pTo my understanding, both OCSP and CRL require the issuer of the certificate to validate it. So now Im stuck because that is not included in the input. The AIA extension might include a URL to a CA certificate, but unfortunately this is the CA of the issuing certificate and not the certificate itself.p  pIs there any other way to get the issuers certificate given only the leaf Or are there some cases in which OCSPCRL can validate without itp

Negative 25902 pI would like to make HTTP requests over SSH tunnels using Twisted. I have seen examples of using Twisted to set up SSH local port forwarding, but thats not what I am after.p  pInstead, it seems to me it should be possible using Twisted to wrap the HTTP traffic inside SSH tunnel directly  ie. without having to set up Twisted to listen on a local port for forwarding traffic.p  pIve checked how Twisted Conch commandline script does the local port forwarding, in conch.ssh.forwarding. Should that be somehow integrated with a HTTP client Or, on the other hand, Ive read that SSHChannel supports twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport interface, so it could be given to Protocols to run them over the secure connection Then theres the newish endpoints API in Twisted I wonder if an endpoint for tunneling traffic from the ssh server onwards would make sensep  pOr something elsep

The underlying issue is that I do emnotem know how to parse the JSON file I provided. My efforts thus far to parse what I have are not sorting the data correctly into the class, since I dont understand how to use the libraries for JSON parsing to parse this complex file. Its a little too complex for my own knowledge of the subject currently, and I am seeking your help with how to use the Jackson library, or any other library that is suitable, to correctly parse this file into a Java Object in this case a class.p

Negative 25902 pI am writing a database backed web server and I was wondering about the best practiseidiomatic way to implement the followingp  pSo when a user creates account the server needs to insure that the username has not been already taken.  The username field in the database is defined as a unique key.  So rather than doing a two step process of checking the existence of the username and then adding it, I was hoping I could take advantage of the DBMS.  By this I mean, just add the record and trust that an SQLException will be thrown.  p  pMy issue is how to find the cause of the exception.  As in I certainly cannot return exception.getMessage to the user but I need a way of identifying if it was due to a duplication in an unique key field that caused the error and therefore let the user know and not another type of issue that JDBC may throw other issues should instead be logged.p  pI could try to parse e.getMessage but I was hoping there would be a more full proof way to do this.p

But other simple fields still have their values. SO i assume im doing it right, and play sees a null field in the new object, and not overwrites the old value with null, just the fields that are set in the updateobject. p  pBut this does not work on OneToMany relationships.

So it will perform an partialupdate, only overwriting fields with nonnull values. This works for simple things, like String username. But when it comes to relationships like OneToMany it fails, and always overwrites the stored value with the value from the new object, EVEN when it is null.  What i want is, that also relationship fields are treated like normal fields, and when the field is null, the field on the old object should not be overwrittenp  pThe whole model classp  precodepackage models  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.Iterator import java.util.List import java.util.regex.Pattern  import javax.naming.directory.InvalidAttributeValueException import javax.persistence.CascadeType import javax.persistence.DiscriminatorValue import javax.persistence.Entity import javax.persistence.ManyToMany import javax.persistence.OneToMany import javax.persistence.OneToOne import javax.persistence.PrePersist import javax.persistence.PreUpdate import javax.persistence.Table import javax.persistence.Transient import javax.validation.Valid import javax.validation.constraints.Null  import com.avaje.ebean.Ebean  import controllers.SettingsController import exceptions.InputValidationException import exceptions.NotYetInitializedException import play.Logger import play.data.validation.ValidationError  Entity Tablename  userTable DiscriminatorValueaUser  User may be a reserved keyword in some sql databases public class User extends AbstractSuperModel  final static Logger.ALogger logger  Logger.ofUser.class final private static String usernameRegexPattern  [w]3,   This prevents binding of this value from forms Null javax.persistence.Columnunique  true private String username  Must not be set by forms, only by controllers   OneToMany  private SetltTicketgt responsibleForTickets  ManyToMany  private SetltTicketgt subscribedTickets  OneToMany  private SetltTicketgt reportedTickets  public String secondaryEmails  private String testString  ManyToManycascade  CascadeType.PERSIST private ListltJobgt jobs  Null OneToManycascade  CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy  user public ListltMailgt mails  public UserString username throws InputValidationException      logger.infoAdding a new User   username     Pattern regex  Pattern.compileusernameRegexPattern     if regex.matcherusername.matches          logger.errorusername                   is not a valid username.

Negative 25902 pLearning HTMLAngular.p  pI have a bunch of HTML code that I want to be reusable. Basically I write it once and modify the same code base, then just insert the dynamic data using Angular.p  pMy question is  How do I create reusable HTML code that can be injected into a page using Angularp  pFor instance, lets say I am an app developer and want to showcase 25 apps on the same page each with their own HTML component not just a bunch of images. Rather than copying the HTML 25 times I would just like to inject that HTML snippet via some angular command, then insert the text into the corresponding divs etc. I need to stick with AngularHTML no other frameworksp  pOr is there a better wayp  plook at the image for reference  imagine inserting that layout 25 times without duplicating codep  pI have tried this using ngrepeat but when I do so it throws the repeating items in the same spot on top of each other. I was hoping that for every div that is repeated it would put it underneath the other div.p  precodeltdiv idapps ngcontrollerMyAppsgt     ltdiv idappsection ngrepeatapp in applistgt       ltimg classrightappimg srcapp.img gt       ltstrong classappbannertextgtapp.firstLineltstronggt       ltstrong classappbannertextsubtitlegtapp.secondLineltstronggt       ltstrong classappbannertextsubtitlesmallgtltspan classiosgtiOS, iPhone, iPadltspangt amp ltspan classandroidgt Androidltspangtltstronggt       ltstrong classappbannerdescriptiontitlegtapp.fourthLineltstronggt       ltp classappbannerdescriptiongtapp.fifthLineltpgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comX8upb.png altOverlapp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comePs7H.png altenter image description herep

Negative 25902 pI am developing a site using Magento v1.9.0.1. I need to change the label of some shipping methods, the ones called Media Mail and Priority Mail 1Day.

The way to change the labels is to find the shipping.phtml and available.phtml files and edit code within them.

Negative 25902 pstrongRESOLVEDstrong The segfault was caused by infinite well, not emactuallyem infinite recursion. The infinite recursion took place in my codeuint powuint a, uint bcode function and its helper function when I forgot to account for the case codeb  0code. When codeb  0code, codebcode will decrease, wrapping it around to the codeunsigned intcode limit, and then keep adding stacks until codebcode gets back to 1.p  pThank you chris for helping with debugging, and vsoftco for suggesting infinite recursion.p  hr  pIm pretty new to C.

Negative 25902 pI have two applications, one server and other client, both written in C and Qt, but both of them also uses a C library that uses C socket methods to perform a socket communication between them and this all in Linux.p  pWhen both of them are connected and I close the client, when the server tries to send a new message to it, it gets a SIGPIPE error and closes. I did some research on the web and in SO to see how could I create a handler for the SIGPIPE so instead of closing the application, Ild tell the timers that constantly send the information to stop.p  pNow I did learn how to simply handle the signal create a method that receives a int and use signalSIGPIPE, myMethod inside main or global note learned that from SO and yes, I know that signal is obsolete.p  pBut the problem is that by doing this way Im unable to stop the sending of information to the dead client, for the method that handles the signal needs to be either outside the class which sends the message or a static method, which dont have access to my server object.p  pTo clarify, here is the current architecturep  pmain.cppp  precodevoid signalcallbackhandlerint signum      qDebug ltlt Caught signal SIGPIPE ltlt signum ltlt  closing the application      exitEXITFAILURE   int mainint argc, char argv[]      QApplication appargc, argv     app.setApplicationNameConnEmulator     app.setApplicationVersion1.0.0     app.setOrganizationNameEmbrasul     app.setOrganizationDomainhttpwww.embrasul.com.br      MainWidget window     window.show       Catch Signal Handler SIGPIPE      signalSIGPIPE, signalcallbackhandler      return app.exec  codepre  pThe MainWidget class simplifiedp  precodeMainWidgetMainWidgetQWidget parent      QWidgetparent,     uinew UiMainWidget,     timerSendDatanew QTimerthis      uigtsetupUithis      connecttimerSendData,SIGNALtimeout,this,SLOTslotSendData      timerSendDatagtstart     ...   void MainWidgetslotSendData      Prepares data     ...

See below.p  pHere is the queryp  precodeSELECT c.gender AS Gender,        COUNTDISTINCT mr.mailingrecipientid AS Mailing Recipients,    SELECT COUNTDISTINCT CASE WHEN mrc.mailingrecipientclicktypeid  2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END  AS Open Total,        AVGCASE WHEN mrc.mailingrecipientclicktypeid  2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS Avg Open,    SELECT COUNTDISTINCT CASE WHEN mrc.mailingrecipientclicktypeid  1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END  AS Click Total,        AVGCASE WHEN mrc.mailingrecipientclicktypeid  1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS Avg Click,        COUNTDISTINCT ca.consactioncontributionid AS Donations,        AVGca.transactionamt AS Avg Donation Amt FROM mailing m        LEFT JOIN mailingrecipient mr ON m.mailingid  mr.mailingid       LEFT JOIN mailingrecipientclick mrc ON mr.mailingrecipientid  mrc.mailingrecipientid       LEFT JOIN consactioncontribution ca ON mr.consid  ca.consid       LEFT JOIN cons c ON c.consid  ca.consid WHERE m.mailingid  1   AND gender IS NOT NULL GROUP BY c.gender codepre  pHere is the table which would be correct if the totals in the fields were correctp  precodeGENDER    Mailing Recipient    Open Total    Avg Open    Click Total    Avg Click    Donations     Avg Amt F         105                  2             0.5000      2              0.5000       105           22.5000 M         98                   2             0.5000      2              0.5000       98            18.8780 codepre  pEDIT Here is an example of what I am hoping to achieve. I am certain that the above values are being repeated. The below values are just examples of what I am expectingp  precodeGENDER    Mailing Recipient    Open Total    Avg Open    Click Total    Avg Click    Donations     Avg Amt F         105                  8             0.0761      4              0.0380       2             22.5000 M         98                   2             0.0204      1              0.0102       1             18.8000 codepre  pEdit After playing around a bit, I thought that I had discovered that the joining the cons table was what is giving me problematic returns, but the problem is with GROUP BY when using gender. To illustrate, this query which is grouped by mailing name instead of gender works beautifully. p  precodeselect m.mailingname AS mailing, COUNTDISTINCT mr.mailingrecipientid AS Mailing Recipients, SUMCASE                 when mrc.mailingrecipientclicktypeid  2 THEN 1             END      AS Open Total, AVGCASE                 WHEN mrc.mailingrecipientclicktypeid  2 THEN 1                 ELSE 0             END AS Avg Open, SUMCASE                 WHEN mrc.mailingrecipientclicktypeid  1 THEN 1             END      AS Click Total,  AVGCASE                 WHEN mrc.mailingrecipientclicktypeid  1 THEN 1                 ELSE 0             END AS Avg Click,  COUNTca.consactioncontributionid AS Donations,  AVGca.transactionamt AS Avg Donation Amt  FROM  mailing m   LEFT JOIN mailingrecipient mr ON m.mailingid  mr.mailingid  LEFT JOIN mailingrecipientclick mrc  ON mr.mailingrecipientid  mrc.mailingrecipientid    LEFT JOIN consactioncontribution ca ON mr.consid  ca.consid LEFT JOIN cons c ON mr.consid  c.consid WHERE  m.mailingid  1 GROUP BY m.mailingname codepre  pThe statement is identical with the exception of the first and last lines.p  pAny and all help would be appreciatedp

Negative 25902 pI am working on a script that will generate a succession of images drawn using the python turtle module.  In researching this I have found that I will probably be only able to get EPS images out of turtle which I have been successful in doing.  For a quick demo of this I then had to use Photoshop to batch convert the images.  I would therefore obviously like to do the conversion within the script.p  ol liDraw a frame using turtleli liGet the frame in EPSli liConvert the frame to JPGli liRepeatli ol  pWithin the script are two functions I have tried as well as a simplified bit of conversion code within the for loop.  The first function produces an error message and the second function does nothing.  Within the simplified conversion code within the for loop I have identified the line which is causing the issue which probably has something to do with the save method.p  pI am using the latest version of Pillow with Python 3.4 and have removed PIL.

I cant figure out why this is happening When i try to show the 2 animations it does nothing, but then when i try the other show view its like it was added to a queue and it shows all 3.p  pMy code for initiating the two animationsp  precode        LinearLayout layoutMsgs  LinearLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.layoutMsgs         Animation anim  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetApplicationContext, R.anim.msgsshow         anim.setAnimationListenernew AnimListenerlayoutMsgs, View.VISIBLE  sets visibility on animation end         layoutMsgs.startAnimationanim          TextView tvMsgs  TextViewfindViewByIdR.id.tvMsgs         Animation tvAnim  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetApplicationContext, R.anim.tvmsgsshow         tvMsgs.startAnimationtvAnim codepre  pMy code for hiding the two animationsp  precode    LinearLayout layoutMsgs  LinearLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.layoutMsgs     Animation animLayout  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetApplicationContext, R.anim.msgshide     animLayout.setAnimationListenernew AnimListenerlayoutMsgs, View.INVISIBLE     layoutMsgs.startAnimationanimLayout      TextView tvMsgs  TextViewfindViewByIdR.id.tvMsgs     Animation animMsgs  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetApplicationContext, R.anim.tvmsgshide      tvMsgs.startAnimationanimMsgs codepre  pThen this is the other animation that is working fine, its only one animation, no textView, just a layoutp  precode        LinearLayout pokeLayout  LinearLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.layoutPokes         Animation anim  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetApplicationContext, R.anim.pokeshow         anim.setAnimationListenernew AnimListenerpokeLayout, View.VISIBLE         pokeLayout.startAnimationanim codepre  pSo how can i fix this Sorry if my explanation is bad im finding it difficult to explain all the details, please ask for any missing information.p

Now I have to figure out how to turn these links into images I think using bitmaps, and display them in the Listview. I dont want to load them to the SD card because that would use up disk space for each image, but rather store them in the cache. The problem is, emI cant use any thirdparty libraries for cachingem. Ive searched on Google and mostly found things like LazyLoad and Universal Image Loader but unfortunately they seem to be thirdparty, not official. I found LruCache, on the Android Developer website but is the best one for my purposes Can you let me know what other options I have to solve my problemp  pThank youp

Negative 25902 pI am working on a game engine that utilizes actors made up of various components.  These actors own their components and the components own their parent actor as well.  I have a member function called Destroy that breaks the circular reference chain so that everything can be cleaned up.  I am trying to do basically everything as components.  For example, even cameras are components attached to certain actors.  This means that things such as the renderer need access to the camera components in order to extract their view and proj matrices so I want to keep a list in the renderer of the currently active cameras and the windows in which they render to.  I cant make it shared pointer because that would prevent actors from being destroyed when they are supposed to.  I dont wanna use a weak pointer either because it will need to be locked every frame in order to get the view and projection matrices.  So I was going to try and use a raw pointer and just check it for nullptr before using it.  Unfortunately that doesnt work.  When the sharedptr to the camera component goes outta scope the raw pointer stays valid but just points to garbage  I was under the impression that the sharedptr should have cleaned it up.  Would this be a case where I would need a custom deleter  One that deletes and sets the value to nullptrp

This creates a twoview hierarchy where the child is placed in the content view of its parent Vibrancy checkbox is enabled in the Attributes Inspector pane for the child view.p  pFrom what I understand, anything placed within the content view of this child view should have the Vibrancy effect applied to it.p  pIve placed in two copies of a PNG logo. One in the spot for vibrancy, and one at the toplevel of the view hierarchy. When I build and run to the simulator, everything works as expected. Only the first logo inside the content view shows the vibrancy effect. When run on the device, this view completely disappears and only the opaque logo at the top of the view hierarchy remains.p
Negative 25902 pim trying to do thatp  pI would like to have a vector stdvector with object defined like thisp  precodeclass MyObj    private        idNumber  it could be a pointer        firstConnection  it could be a pointer        secondConnection  it could be a pointer    public    ...   vectorltMyObjgt vectorOfObj10 codepre  pSo I want the codeidNumbercode of the object, which is an element of vector, corresponding with the index of the same element, and set the connections bidirectional between the elements in example codevectorOfObj[5]code is connected with codevectorOfObj[7]code and codevectorOfObj[4]code Id like the elements keep their references valid id amp connections if the structure of the vector is modified in example if element 6 is set in 4 and 4 is set in 6, the objects change their id and if 5 was connected with 4 now is connected with 6 . I accept all kind of solutions if they worth it. I thought a lot about it but I cannot find a solution.p  pI hope I was clear. Thankyoup

Negative 25902 pSo this program is supposed to collect weather temperatures over 7 days using a for loop and then basically just print them back out to the user with an average temperature and the highest recorded temperature. Keep in mind, the following piece of code is a part of a much larger program. Anyway, the problem seems to be the highesttemp1 float variable.

Negative 25902 pI have a web application built on a MEAN stack.p  pWhat are some best practices of deploying my code  I have come across a few optionsp  p1 Use git.  This effectively does a git pull on EC2, then bounces all the servers.  This seems the easiest, but I did notice all my source code is on EC2.  All I really need on EC2 are the concatenated and minified .js.css files...I dont need all the source code.  One other issue Ive been having with this is during deployment, my CPU usage spikes, mainly due to npm sometimes taking up to 6070 CPU usage, and occasionally, hangs.p  p2 Use Grunt to package up only the stuff I need, then do an SSH or SCP to EC2, and bounce everything.  This ensures I only have what I need on EC2, but feels quite a cowboy approach.p  pAny perspectives on these 2 options  Is there a third option I should considerp

Then I deployed a Container Engine cluster and I started up a docker registry with a pod file and used a service in front of the pod. I can access the docker registry just fine from all cluster hosts and the master just fine. I also tried to create a external load balancer so that the docker registry is public. All works fine. p  pHowever, I dont want the registry to be public. I just want my Jenkins VM to be able to access the docker registry service in the Container cluster. But it does not work. It looks like they are on a different subnet. Jenkins has the IP 10.240.126.57 and the dockerregistryservice in the Container cluster has 10.131.249.127. p  pWhat is the best way to achieve this I played with Routes but for some reason Im incapable to get this to work. Sidenote all VMs can ping all the container and vice versa, but I just cannot access Container engine service IPs. p

Negative 25902 pI am trying to write a query which will give me all the nodes which are connected with a master node. Lets say that the node connect like thisp  precode      A gt B       B gt C       C gt D       C gt E       B gt F codepre  pWhat I want initially is to write a query which will return to me all the nodes names under the master node A. All the nodes are related with a contain relationship.p  pI wrote this queryp  precodeMATCH n gid58749[contains]z RETURN z as names codepre  pWhen I run this query in the neo4jServer I get a nice graph, which shows indeed all the nodes which are related.  BUT when I check the table vizualisation of the date not the graph I get much more results.  As you can see in the pictures in the first one on the button it says displaying 8 nodes 9 relationships but in the second one for the same think it says returned 48 rows. So, the question is what the heck is going onp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjz8gO.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIJLPn.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDITEDstrongp  pChanging the query to thisp  precode      MATCH n gid58749[contains]z RETURN distinctz as names codepre  psolves partially the problem. Nodes with the same name id will be aggregated.p

Negative 25902 pI have a codeRecyclerViewcode populated with codeCardViewcodes. In the codeonLongClickcode method of the codeCardViewcodes, I open a dialog with the option to delete that card, but Im running into problems with the app crashing. If I have multiple cards and delete them one at a time, it will sometimes throw codeIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionscode or codeCursorIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionscode when I try to delete more than one in a row. p  pIts important to note that if I delete one, leave that activity and then return, everything will be fine when I try to delete another. Is this because the adapter is being replaced with a new one p  pIm not sure how to fix the problem. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks p  pAlso, one other quick quesiton where in the adapter can I implement a method that uses codegetItemCountcode to see if there are no cards left, and then inflate a new layout Currently, I have something like that imeplemented in the codeFragmentcode class which instantiates and assigns this adapter, but it wont work unless the activity is recreated.p  pHere is most of the code in my adapter class, which extends codeRecyclerView.AdapterltSessionAdapter.ViewHoldergtcodep  precodeprivate MyAdapter adapter  this  public MyAdapter ArrayListltMyObjectgt mArrayList, ...      this.mArrayList  mArrayList     ...

Negative 25902 pIf i writep  precodeString s1  True String s2  True codepre  ps1s2 will return true. During compiletime, as i understand it, a String pool is created, where strings which are created this way ends up. When creating s2 the compiler will check the string pool for said string, and if such string exist, point towards the same one.p  precodeString s3  new StringFalse String s4  new StringFalse codepre  ps3s4 will return false. Objects created with the new command will be created in heap space. So these generates two objects and point towards different strings, despite their contents being identical. s3.equalss4 would return true.p  pNow, this is what i dont understand.p  precodeString s5  False String sx  F String s6  sx  alse codepre  pthis returns false, and i do not understand why. These strings should all be created during compiletime, and end up in the string pool, no  s5 should generate an object in the stringpool, sx should generate an object in stringpool. This i am certain of, but how exactly does s6 create its objectp  pAs i understand it, concatenation of string literals occurs during compiletime, so for example String s1  True String s2  T  rue s1s2 returns true, since jvm checks the stringpool for True.p  pThanksp  pedit This question differs because the threads i checked did not address the situation where i first create two strings and create a third one by using one of the two previous reference and another string, such as sx  alse above.p
Negative 25902 pIm looking for leads on how to capture web page metadata from the current browser page. I want to create a feature in my application that will allow the user to press a hot key and record meta data from the web page currently open in the users browser. My application will be running minimized, this feature is to be activated by a global hot key.p  pIm using nw.js formerly NodeWebkit to create this application, so ideally, the solution would be javascript running in a desktop installation of Node.js. If this is not practical, I understand that I can call platform specific code from nw.js, so solutions developed in any desktop os language would be of interest.p  pMy application targets OS X and Windows.p  pIm hoping to capture metadata from all major modern browsers Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE 10.p  pAt a minimum I need to capture the page url, but I also want to capture Keywords, Description and highlighted text for the source web page.p  pI need to implement this function without modifying the source webpage in any way, and I prefer to avoid the need for browser extensions, bookmarklets or plugins. p  pIf a solution exists using a remote controlled browser extension no user interaction that would be of interest, but ideally I want to avoid requiring the end user to install or interact with anything but my application.p  pMy search to date has located no information on reading web page information from applications outside the browser.p  pAny thoughts or leads are much appreciated.p

Negative 25902 pI have a slave model implemented in codeuvmagentcode. By slave I meant that it can not initiate transaction by itself. Transaction is always initiated by the other side master DUT. So it is kind of passive agent although it is still able to transmit reply packet.br When the slave detect a packet from DUT, it will responsereply automatically based on its protocol with another packet.  The slave agent has a monitor to listen to DUTs initiate transfer. And since it is able to transmit packet, the slave agent also does have a driver to send a reply packet. p  precode  master initiate transfer    Master DUT   gt  UVM Agent  slave mode                                           Monitor                                                          Driver     Sequencer                                                                 Master DUT                              UVM Agent  slave mode                 slave auto reply          Monitor                              lt  Driver     Sequencer                                 codepre  pMy question is how does it suppose to send the reply packet Directly from its driver Since in uvm way, the driver item is always from a sequencer that is executing sequence from user test level. But now in this case, there is no sequence  only a detected packet from monitor.p  pMy first idea is that I need to provide sort of feedback from codemonitorcode to codesequencercode and implement my protocol function there.br Or should I pass the packet directly from codemonitorcode to codedrivercode, and let it process it and send reply If so, how do I do that Is there any better wayp

Negative 25902 pIm trying to learn about the guts of Unix right now, mostly through experimentation. When I was first starting, I found myself looking through forum posts, copying and pasting bash code. When I broke something, I often had to do a fresh install because I couldnt remember what exactly I had changed where. Now, the simple solution is to record a log of all the system files Ive changed and keep original copies of all the default files so I can revert if necessary. It would be great if there was a cl tool which did this for me automatically. It would be even greater if I could step back through changes. Basically, Im looking to version control my entire OS. p  pDoes anything like this exist I would also accept alternative strategies for spelunking through Unix without causing permanent damage if you think Im going about this wrong. p  pUsing debian if it matters.p

Negative 25902 pWere using jersey 1.8.3 with embedded jetty 8 server, in ActiveActive mode, using a loadbalancer.p  pFor one of our usecases, we need some kind of stickiness  not the standard stickiness where a client sends all the requests to the same node, but only for a specific transaction  which mean a set of requests where the first one creates the transaction in the server, and the last one commits the changes, then the transaction is dead.p  pWe implemented it by sending full URL in the location response header of create transaction request. We builds the Location URL using the UriInfo.getBaseUri method.p  pThis approach does not work for several reasons, e.g. in some deployments there is no direct access to the servers, but only to the load balancer. Also, and Im still not sure about it, UriInfo.getBaseUri returns the LB address rather than the server address.p  pIs there any standard way to achieve the above Any other ideap  pThanksp

Negative 25902 pIs there any way to be notified automatically if some view controller is presented modally on top of another view controller other than codeviewWillDisappearcode, which is obviously not called for nonfullscreen modal presentation on iPadp  pBackgrounduse case In an iPad app, whenever a modal form sheet is presented, I want to adjust the appearance of the view behind the modal. However, the presentation if the modals is not necessarily done in the same view controller that needs to adapt, but can rather happen in some child or parent VCs. Of course, I could just communicate this event manually via notification, delegation or whatever, but thats quite repetitive and can easily be forgotten when adding further modal form sheets in the future.p  pThus, Im wondering if there is any more elegant way to achieve this. Ive tried KVO on codepresentedViewControllercode, but that doesnt seem to work and Im also not sure if codepresentedViewControllercode will actually be set if the modal presentation is done by a child view controller....p

Negative 25902 pWhen using Auto Layout the Universal Storyboard, we discovered that using Trailing Space and Leading Space to make a UIViews width equal to the device width does not work.p  pWhile the UIView looks fine on the Storyboard, the UIViews width comes back as 600, even though the device is an iPhone 5s and should be 320. According to other SO posts and documentation online, the Universal Storyboard has dimensions of 600x600.p  pWhats the right way to make the UIView share the same width as the device using Auto Layout and Universal Storyboard while also making sure its frame has the same valuep

Negative 25902 pIm looking to use a liner algebra library that calculates eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However the libraries that I have used up until now like JAMA return the eigenvalues in a sorted order. I have a problem with that because I have mapped every column of my matrices to a specific feature keyword and when the eigenvalues are calculated and ordered, I have no way of reconstructing that mapping. This is why Im looking for a library that strongdoesnt orderstrong the eigenvalues.p  pI stumbled upon Apaches Commons math library, but I cant find any information in the API documentation whether the codegetDcode method returns ordered eigenvalues or not. Does it do so If it does, can anyone recommend a library that doesnt do so Ive looked into lists of LA libraries for java, but in none of their documentations could I find information about whether they return ordered eigenvalues.p

Negative 25902 pLets just accept for a moment that it is not a horrible idea to implement RPC over message queues like RabbitMQ  sometimes it might be necessary when interfacing with legacy systems.p  pIn case of RPC over RabbitMQ, clients send a message to the broker, broker routes the message to a worker, worker returns the result through the broker to the client. However, if a worker implements more than one remote method, then somehow the different calls need to be routed to different listeners. p  pWhat is the general practice in this case All RPC over MQ examples show only one remote method. It would be nice and easy to just set the method name as the routing rulequeue name, but I dont know whether this is the right way to do it.p

So is there any way of generating site map apart from manually generating itp
