Positive 72972 pI am trying to load a remote image in XAML which requires an authentication header to successfully download. p  pCurrently Im using my own caching service where I download the image using HttpClient and store the file to disk. On subsequent loads, I just bind the image to the absolute file path of the cached file like sop  precode              ltImage Width50                    Height50                    StretchUniformToFill                    HorizontalAlignmentCenter                    VerticalAlignmentCenter                    SourceBinding CachedImagePathgt codepre  pThis works however Im not too pleased with the time it takes to load the image from the file. It seems much slower than if I use XAML caching.p  pSo my questions arep  p1 Is there a way to pass an authentication header when I bind my Image to a remote URIp  p2 If not, can you recommend a quicker way to load the image from disk than how I currently have itp

Positive 72972 pI have a Windows Phone 8.1 RT application. In the app, I subscribe to codeUnhandledExceptioncode event which is raised when any unhandled exception occurs in the application.

Once I hover the cursor or access the value in the immediate window, it becomes null afterwards.  p  pIt also causes an issue when I read any property of codeUnhandledExceptionEventArgscode before reading the codeStacktracecode property. Say, if codeecode is of type codeUnhandledExceptionEventArgscode containing codeMessagecode and codeExceptioncode object, accessing codee.Messagecode before accessing codee.Exception.Stacktracecode makes the value contained in codee.Exception.Stacktracecode null.  p  pAny idea why this odd behavior is observedp

Positive 72972 pI am working on an windows8 application, in which I have a grid to show list of items. Each row has a textbox to take some input, when I enter any value on one of the textbox in a row and then scroll down then other rows scrolling up from bottom automatically has this same value set in the textbox. This is causing issues as I am getting unwanted rows in behind code. p  pAny idea what is this and how to handle it p  pBelow is how it looks  See, I am on 3rd line and 6th line already has value.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comgvWXb.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgvWXb.png altenter image description herea p
Positive 72972 pI just got tripped up by this in a Windows Store app, here is a simplified examplep  preApp.cs Global timer  MainPage Subscribes to Global Timer, button to create a local timer, button to goto page 2  Page2 Subscribes to Global Timer, button to create local timer, back buttonpre  pOn MainPage, it click the button to create a local timer. I see it and the global timer ticking.p  pGoto page 2. Still see ticks coming from subscribed global timer and local timer on Main Page. Start the local timer on page 2. p  pGo back, on MainPage. Now see 5 timers runningp  preThe original MainPage subscribed to Global Timer the original MainPage subscribed to local timer A new subscription to Global Timer The Page2 subscribed to Global Timer The Page2 subscribed to its local timerpre  pI realize I can use the navigatedtofrom events to subscribeunsubscribe from the global timer. A bit of a pain because in my real example I can subscribe to dozens of different events in different pages from the global class. A little harder to find the timers created in the local timer button since there is no reference to it outside the button.p  pAre the subscribers keeping the previous pages alive or is this normal I looked at NavigationCacheMode mode, by default creates a new instance each time. I assumed everything was basically cleared, which is why to have to save the state of textboxs, etc, when going between pages.p  pIs the only way around this to unsubscribe to all global events when navigating away, and to keep a class level variable so I have a reference to one offs like my local timerp

Negative 72972 pIve read several XSRF solutions that rely on adding more tokens to the response, which do help protect code that only runs on POST.p  pi.e. this would be a one step attack relying on a page that responds to HTTP GET p  precodeltimg srchttpamazon.combuybookanarchistscookbookmailtomeexecute.phpgt codepre  pBut with better libraries like jquery, its getting easier to write malicious javascript XmlHttpRequest scripts, that can do a two step attack a GET, parse the AntiXSRF viewstatequery stringextra cookie etc and then submit a POST.  Or is it  I dont worry about AES being cracked any time soon, should I even worry about 2 step XSRF attacks targeting HTTP POST actions becoming as easy as the img tag attack shown abovep  pstrongI suppose the one step attack can mostly be tharted by not doing anything sensive on GET, could both kinds of attacks be tharted by requiring the website user to solve a CAPTCHA, which then yeilds a query string token that would be required for all URLs for the rest of the sessionstrongp  pSo far it seems like it would only fail when CAPTCHA fails, such as if OCR software can read the text or if there is a mechanical turk component.p  pEDIT The particular attack in mind is an email with xhr javascript or image tag. So the code would be executing in email clients browser or from a HTML page loaded from the local filesystem.  For simplicities sake, Im imagining the site has no XSS vulnerabilties ie. no opportunities for malicious users to inject their HTML into the HTML the site sends as responsesp

Negative 72972 pIm a first year computer science student having a problem with part of an assignment. The goal of the assignment was to store the coefficients for a polynomial and find its roots using both an array and a linked list. I was able to successfully complete the array version however the linked list is giving me a headache. p  pI am able to successfully store the initial round of variables provided in polynomial.java however, things go a bit crazy once the root calculations begin and the program ends up terminating without giving any roots. I have a feeling this might be being cause by the way the Polynomial.java calculates the roots causing problems with the linked list however, I am not allowed to change polynomial.java, only LinkedIntList.java. I have been banging my head against the computer for the past 7 hours trying to find the bug and am about ready to just give up on the assignment as I cant reach the professor for help.p  pId greatly appreciate anyone who can spot the bug or are willing to look over the code to provide tips on what I may be doing wrong or how I can work around my problem.p  pFile 1 Node.Javap  precodepackage lists  public class Node      int element     Node next  null             Constructor which creates a new node containing the value specified by item                public Node int item              element  item                  Returns the current value of the data item contained inside this node           public int getElement               return element                  Sets the current value of the data item contained inside this node to       the value specified by newVal           public void setElement int newVal              element  newVal                  Links this node to the node passed in as an argument            public void setNext Node n              next  n                  Returns a reference to the node that follows this node in the       linked list, or null if there is no such node           public Node getNext               return next                  Returns a string based representation of the data item contained       in this node.           public String toString              return Integer.toStringelement          codepre  pFile 2 LinkedIntList.Javap  precode    package lists      public class LinkedIntList implements IntList               Node head  null         int count  0                    Standard Java toString method that returns a string           equivalent of the IntList                     return  a string indicating the values contained in                     this IntList ex [5 3 2 9 ]                   public String toString                      String retVal               String intermediary               Node n             for n  head n.getNext  null n  n.getNext                              intermediary  Integer.toStringn.getElement                 retVal  intermediary     retVal                          retVal  n.getElement     retVal             return retVal                              Adds the given value to the ltbgtendltbgt of the list.                     param value  the value to add to the list                   public void add int value                      Node newNode  new Node value              if head  null                 head  newNode             else                              Node n  head                 while n.getNext  null                                      n  n.getNext                                  n.setNextnewNode                          count                              Returns the number of elements currently in the list.                     return   the number of items currently in the list                   public int size                      return count                              Returns the element at the specified position in this list.                     param index  index of the element to return zerobased           return the element at the specified position in this list.            throws IndexOutOfBoundsException  if the index is out of range                                               index lt 0  index gt size.                    public int getint index throws IndexOutOfBoundsException                      Node reference  head             if index lt 0  index gt count                              throw new IndexOutOfBoundsExceptionIndex out of bounds.                          for int i  0 i  index i                                      reference.getNext                              return reference.getElement                              Replaces the element at the specified position in this list with            the specified element.                      param index  index of the element to return zerobased           param value  element to be stored at the specified position.           throws IndexOutOfBoundsException  if the index is out of range                                               index lt 0  index gt size.                    public void set int index, int value throws IndexOutOfBoundsException                      if index lt 0  index gt count                              throw new IndexOutOfBoundsExceptionIndex out of bounds.

There are 3 fields in the db relating to these possible file uploads. Ticking the form checkboxes causes the corresponding uploaded files to be unlinked. It works fine.p  pHeres my puzzle. How do I deleteupdate the right entry in the db corresponding to the unlinked filesp  pThe problem is the 3 checkboxes are named the same in the html delpic[]. Values returned by ticking the checkboxes, in other words, are plonked into an array. This is key to managing the unlinking succinctly I think.p  pIf just one file for a particular row is to be unlinked, how can the app know the corresponding field in the mysql db to update p  pArgghhh.p  pTomp

Negative 72972 pIve created a standalone java app using netbeans 6.9. In my app if a user selects some optionsvalues for some specific fields then my app automatically generates its corresponding code.That code is displayed in the text area in my app itself.br For example In my app Ive a button for a new variable. If the user clicks on it,my app asks for the variable name. After the name has been entered my app automatically generates the corresponding code for that.br But I want an option for the user to edit that code.br  Suppose the user enters that variable declaration code himself on the text area then my app should sense the presence of that code.br I mean in my app I also have a combobox which shows all the variables declared. So if the user enters that code and saves it then in my app that new variable for which the user has written code for, should be present.br Can anyone help me with this.br Thanks in advancep

Negative 72972 pIn order to support a legacy application thats in the field, I need my ASP.NET MVC app to return an empty response that also has a codeContentTypecode. One of IIS, ASP.NET, or ASP.NET MVC is removing my codeContentTypecode when I send back a null response. Is there any way around thisp  pWhile not requiring an empty response with a set codeContentTypecode would obviously be the ideal solution, the clients are already out there, and many of them cannot be upgraded.p  pstrongEDITstrong Since there was a request for code Im proxying the request from the new web application to the one that older clients rely on. To do this, I have a subclass of codeActionResultcode, called codeLegacyResultcode, that you can simply return for those methods that need to be handled by the old software. This is the relevant part of its codep  precode    public override void ExecuteResultControllerContext context              using var legacyResponse  GetLegacyResponsecontext                      var clientResponse  context.HttpContext.Response             clientResponse.Buffer  false             clientResponse.ContentType  legacyResponse.ContentType  Yes, I checked that legacyResponse.ContentType is never string.IsNullOrEmpty              if legacyResponse.ContentLength gt 0 clientResponse.AddHeaderContentLength, legacyResponse.ContentLength.ToString              var legacyInput  legacyResponse.GetResponseStream             using var clientOutput  clientResponse.OutputStream                              var rgb  new byte[32768]                 int cb                 while cb  legacyInput.Readrgb, 0, rgb.Length gt 0                                      clientOutput.Writergb, 0, cb                                  clientOutput.Flush                            codepre  pIf codelegacyInputcode has data, then codeContentTypecode is set appropriately. Otherwise, its not. I can actually kluge the old backend to send an empty v. nonempty response for exactly the same request, and observe the difference in Fiddler.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong Poking around with Reflector reveals that, if headers have not been written at the time that codeHttpResponse.Flushcode is called, then codeFlushcode writes out the headers itself. The problem is that it only writes out a tiny subset of the headers. One of the missing ones is codeContentTypecode. So it seems that, if I can force headers out to the stream, I can avoid this problem.p

Negative 72972 pIm designing a site, and doing a bunch of work with the styling at the moment.

Ive tried setting codeminheightcode instead of codeheightcode, and removing the codeheightcode property altogether, but I can never get inwrapper or outwrapper to stretch to the content.

Negative 72972 pHey all. Im trying to translate a simple bash script that executes a program called pdb2gmx into C commands so I can include it as a function in a much larger program, but Im having some trouble making it happen.p  pThe bash scriptp  precodebinsh usrlocalgromacsbinpdb2gmx f 1.pdb o 1.gro p 1.top ltlt EOF 14 6 codepre  pSo whats going is that when running the program, it stops and asks for user input at two separate points, one right after the other. In the bash script, just putting down 14 and 6 seems to fulfill the input requirement, but I cant seem to pull off the same trick in C also, Im not really sure what the EOF is doing there, Im just following someone elses example with that, and the script wont work without it.p  pThis is what I have so far in Cp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int main      FILE  pdb2gmx     pdb2gmx  popen pdb2gmx f 1BEO.pdb o 1BEO.gro p 1BEO.top , w      fprintf pdb2gmx, EOF      fprintf pdb2gmx, 14      fprintf pdb2gmx, 6      pclose pdb2gmx   codepre  pbut when this code is executed pdb2gmx just hangs at the first point where it needs user input. So what am I missing p  pMy sense is that the C program itself is also hanging on the execution of the codepopencode line, and never getting to the codefprintfcode lines, but I thought that with codepopencode mode set to codewcode you could just treat the returned stream like user input, so Im pretty confused.p

Negative 72972 pI have a file input field with codeopacity 0code and codefilter alphaopacity 0code that sits ontop of a large div that I use as a button to select a file, the selected filename is displayed below the button.p  pAll works fine, but when you set the codewidthcode property of the file element in this case, the width of the DIV which is underneath it in IE, part of that width is the text area of the file input. Ofcourse, IE does their own thing, and unlike every other browser, the textarea of the element has to be doubleclicked to open the browse dialog. Firefox amp Safari will act on a singleclick of the text part of the element. I thought I had a workaround since IE allows you to invoke the code.clickcode event on the element.p  pI tried thisp  precodeltinput typefile onclickthis.click gt codepre  pwhich did nothing, so I tried thisp  precodeltinput typefile onmouseupthis.click gt codepre  pWhich worked, and the browse dialog was shown with a single click of the text area of the element. But, for some reason when the form is submitted, if there was a file selected, the form would not submit, nothing would happen. If no file was selected, the rest of the form would be submitted.p  pSo now I am back to square one and the left half of my Select File button has to be double clicked to pick a file and the right half can be single clicked. I cant think of any other way to get IE to react to a single click of the element. I tried using the codeonfocuscode event to trigger code.clickcode on the element also, which works, but since this upload dialog will be the only thing on the page, and the codeltinput typefile gtcode is the first input element being rendered, the click event is triggered when the page loads.p  pSo then I tried attaching to the codeonloadcode event of the body, and setting focus to something else, but this was too late and focus had already been given to the file input and the browse dialog already opened. I know I am getting close with the onfocus, is there a way to keep the element from having focus when the page loads Or is there another way to do this that anyone can think ofp  pThanksp  p[update]p  pI tried playing with the onfocus again and unfortunately, I was wrong and focus is called to the file element again when the form is submitted, halting the submission and opening the browse dialog againp

Negative 72972 pAll, Im trying to split my MSTest test run into multiple runs because Im getting OutOfMemoryExceptions thrown at about the 800900ish test mark. I tried profiling mstest.exe with SciTechs profiler to see if I could identify why were holding onto so much memory, but no dice.p  pSo, assuming I cant fix the OutOfMemoryExceptions, Im going to try to work around the problem. The easiest sustainable path available to me is to split our test run into multiple test runs, one per assembly.p  pWe are using the TFS 2010 default codeBuildProcessTemplate.xamlcode file as our build template. In it, the default behavior is to call the MSTest workflow Activity on all test assemblies at once. This behavior is ideal, except it wont work anymore due to the OutOfMemoryExceptions mentioned above.p  pIve split the test runs out out so that the build runs tests for each test assembly, then publishes results. Unfortunately, it appears that Visual Studio is expecting exactly one published test result.p  pSo. Is there a way to combine test results into one combined test result that I can publishp

But getting the joda.time.CLASSXYZ does not work The I instantiate the class CLASSXYZ.  The error is The type org.joda.time.base.BaseDateTime cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files the import was joda.time. so the class should have been importedp  pIve looked at the other threads and most of them just explain how to add folders to the build path. I have apache tomcat set up with eclipse. It works with other projects that I have deployed. p  pThis problem has gotten pretty frustrating as its preventing me from starting the project. Any help you be much appreciated. p  pCheersp
Negative 72972 pI have a site that uses large background photos around 1200px wide on a site that has a page width of around 1060px. In order to prevent horizontal scrollbars from appearing, I need to load the background photos on the body element. The page contains a carousel and when it transitions, the text inside changes slides left to right  right to left depending on the button clicked then once its complete, the background photo changes.p  pIs there anyway to use jQuery to slide the background photo in the body element from one side to another If so, can someone give me an examplep
Negative 72972 pI have a 2D array an image actually that is size N x N.  I need to find the indices of the M largest values in the array   M ltlt N x N .  Linearized index or the 2D coords are both fine.  The array must remain intact since its an image.

Anyone have a good algorithm for doing this as efficiently as possible p

Negative 72972 pQuestions on Rails 3.0.7, and JQuery 1.5.1p  pstrongOverviewstrongp  pIm trying to do the following thing.  I have a web page with a form on one side that lets me create a category, and a list of items on the other side, with a checkbox for each item.  I would like to be able to check the check box, for each item, so that when I submit the form  to create the category, the newly created category also creates a hasmany through association with each item.p  pSo the association part works almost, I can submit a list of checked checkboxes, and Rails creates the association on the backend if I send the list of checked items.  p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pHeres what doesnt workp  pI am trying to submit the form via Ajax, so I wanted to bind an event handle to the rails.js ajaxbeforeSend event, so that it would scan through my list of checked checkboxes and at the checked ids to a hidden form field.p  pThe problem is  I try to get a list of all the checked boxes, and add them to the hidden field when the user clicks the Submit button.  Therefore, I figured Id place the code to do so in the ajaxbeforeSend event handler.  What I THINK Im noticing however, is that rails.js has somehow already processed the form fields, and constructed the HTTP query before this handler fires.  I notice this through the following behaviorp  pstrongObserved Behaviorstrongp  p1  I can reload a fresh page, click the button to submit the form, the alert boxes from my handler pop up saying that no boxes are checked, and the created category in my db has no associated items CORRECT BEHAVIORp  p2  I then click 1 checkbox, the alert boxes pop up showing which boxes are checked CORRECT.  But then when I submit thee form, the category in the DB still has no associate items.  And I can see through firebug and the server logs that and HTTP query was sent containing the old parameter list, not the newer one. WRONGp  p3  I then submit the same form again, changing nothing, and it shows me the correct number of items. p  pSo I get the impression that the parameter construction is lagging.   I hope this wasnt too long, an someone can help me figure out what is going on.  p  pstrongMy Questionstrong  p  pWhat event do I need to bind to, so that the form gets submitted with the correct parameters   Or is there another way to go about it completelyp  pThanksp  pHeres my code below.p  pThanks,p  precode  myform    Now we need to configure the checkboxes to create an association between     the items, and the interaction that is being created.  First we will bind a     function to the click event, and if the box is then checked, we will add     the item id to the list of interaction items.  If it is unchecked, we will     remove the item from the list of interaction items.         .liveajaxbeforeSend, functionevent         First get a list of all the checked Items       var checkeditems  new Array       items input[typecheckbox]checked.eachfunction         checkeditems.pushthis.getAttributedataitemid                Then add this list of items to the newinteraction form to be submitted       interactionnewitems.valcheckeditems       alertcheckeditems       alertinteractionnewitems.val      codepre

Negative 72972 pIs there any way to precompile an MSIL file and then have the .net linker link that into a .net assembly at compile timep  pSo, for example. I have a project. I compile it, decompile it to MSIL, and tweak the msil.p  pNow then, Id like to compile and link that tweaked msil file into another project.p  pYes, I COULD recompile it as a seperate assembly and just reference it, but in this particular case, i cant do that. The contents of the MSIL needs to be actually in the target assembly.p  pAny ideas if this is even possible So far, Ive had no luck finding anything.p  p EDIT One suggestion is ILMerge, which might work. Ill grabbing the latest copy now and will see how that fairs. The only issue I have with that is that in the past, Ive found debugging to be difficult after the merge or at the very least, more difficult than if I didnt use ILmerge. I was hoping to possibly tweak the proj file to include the compiled MSIL directly as part of the build process, so everything would continue to be easily debugged in the IDE. p  p EDIT  Well, doesnt look like ILMerge will work for this scenario First, I got this message   An exception occurred during merging TaskId32   ILMerge.Merge The assembly Blah is not marked as containing only managed code.

Negative 72972 pI have the following scenario I have a rails web portal Rails 3.1 and I use RestKit 0.9.3 the newest version to connect the the portal from an iOS device. I want to map the data structure from the server to the core data model on the iOS device. The model is designed as followsp  pstrongClassesstrongp  ul liUserli liRoleli liPostli liCommentli ul  pstrongRelationsstrongp  ul liA User has zero or one Role  A Role can have multiple Usersli liA User has multiple Posts  A Post has one Userli liA Post has multiple Comments  A Comment has one Postli ul  pThe problem is, that the default mapping of relations in RestKit results in huge messages and redundant transfer because when I sendrecieve the Roles, all the Users will be transfered as well and if I sendrecieve the Users, the Role is added to each User. The same occurs with Users, Posts and Comments. Its just to much data and the best solution, as far as I could think of one, is to just send the IDs, which are referenced and transfer each type. This works perfectly when I send the data from the iOS device to the server by mapping the IDs of the Role to a field roleid in the User, because Rails does understand what to do with that. So the relations are not mapped as relations but just as ID fields. But when I receive Users from the server, which where not present on the device, I get an error, because RestKit does not understand what to do with the mapping, since there is no Role object linked to the User object.p  pSo I researched and found out that you can map the relations and use a mapping of the primary key, so that RestKit would only send the Primary Key of the Role. But now Rails does not understand what to do with it. It looks something like thisp  p id1, uidmyusername, pwdmypassword, role    id0  p  pBut Rails is expecting something like thatp  p id1, uidmyusername pwdmypassword, roleid0 p  pThats my current state and I really dont know how to solve this misunderstandings.p  pI would be very thankful for any helpp

Negative 72972 pConsider the following scenario.p  pAn app that plays audio stream. Then theres the Now Playing view, which have the artist and song title, the album art of the current song and also the Producers name, along side with small description and picture. All of which come from a JSON file. p  pIn order to know when the JSON file has indeed been changed, theres an extra .crc file which contains the timestampcode of the last changed JSON. When the content of the .crc has changed then its time to update the JSON. p  pSo I have an NSTimer firing every 10sec and opens an NSURLConnection which eventually returns the data of the .crc file. On the connectionDidFinish I check if the code has changed from the previous one and if the condition is true then I load the JSON and eventually parsing its data.p  pMy question here is if this 10sec timer with the NSURLConnection is too much for the app, having in mind that theres the constant audio stream playing. Of course when the app enters the background the timer stops. And then when the app enters the foreground I force load the JSON in order to update the view and start the timer again.p  pAlso the now playing view is assigned to a self.nowplayingview ivar created one time only from the root view controller and the self.nowplayingview gets pushed to the stack. This way I can update the Now Playing view from the root view, when theres a change in the JSON.p  pDo you think that I should create and push the Now Playing view every timep  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 72972 pWhat is the preferred method when dealing with choosing a class vs. an IDp  pFor instance, you can have a bunch of elements that might be styled identically and could all use the same class. However, for readability purposes, its sometimes nice to have a unique ID for each element instead.p  pObviously you dont want to go ridiculously overboard where every element has an ID. However, where do you guys draw the line and does using all IDs where you could be using classes slow things down noticeably If so... whenp

Negative 72972 pIm working on this project for a client and were supposed to stream audio from a server onto a device running Android Gingerbread.  To retrieve the stream, the Android client needs to make a request for a variant playlist, and then make a request for the playlist itself the one with URIs that point to the TS file chunks themselves.  Once thats done, the client app decrypts the chunks and sends them to the platform for playback.  p  pThe problem Im having revolves around the security part.  Our clientthe company in question uses a proprietary encryption scheme that serves the keys for decrypting the TS file chunks ahead of time through an HTTP request instead of following the HLS spec and serving the key files through URIs listed in the index files themselves. As far as I can tell, the Android Mediaplayer framework has the ability to find these key files and generatefind the appropriate IVs for decryption IF the key file URIs are in the index files.  p  pUnfortunately, what this all means is that I cant decrypt the file chunks and play back the stream without gaps between each segment  I accomplish this by making HTTP GET requests for each segment, downloading them to internal storage, applying decrypting, and then playing them back using the following codep  precode  public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.main      File dir  new FileTSFILEDIR     String [] files  dir.list      mTsFiles  new ArrayListltFilegt     for String file  files          String path  TSFILEDIR  file         mTsFiles.addnew Filepath           mMediaController  new MediaControllerthis     mVideoView  VideoViewfindViewByIdR.id.videoview1      mVideoView.setVideoPathmTsFiles.get0.getAbsolutePath     mVideoView.setMediaControllermMediaController     mVideoView.setOnPreparedListenernew OnPreparedListener           Override         public void onPreparedMediaPlayer mp              mp.setAudioStreamTypeAudioManager.STREAMMUSIC             mp.start                   mVideoView.setOnCompletionListenernew OnCompletionListener          Override         public void onCompletionMediaPlayer mp              mp.pause             mp.reset              if mIndex lt mTsFiles.size                  mIndex                  try                      mp.setDataSourcemTsFiles.getmIndex.getAbsolutePath                     mp.prepareAsync                                  catch Exception e                      e.printStackTrace                                               codepre  pIve triedp  p1 Using 2 mediaplayers and switching between the 2, but it doesnt work at all 2 Staring at the source code for ICS to get an idea of how this all works, but its very complex and Im not well versed in cp  pIs there anything I missedp
Negative 72972 pOur blog is fairly high traffic, but we use a substantial amount of caching to deal with it. In the last few months weve been experiencing random settings loss  such as the plugins being deactivated, theme undetected, URLs being deleted from admin screen. Basically, it all points towards an incomplete read of the wpoptions table, likes its being cut off somehow. p  pWeve tried deactivating plugins with heavy usage, weve cleaned out the options table of transients, and now were at about 150 autoload options.

Negative 72972 pI have a native C MFC app. It has a main window based on CWnd, and user action can create a modal dialog. While the dialog is active, I want the main window to disappear, the dialog to be visible, and the main windows icon to remain in the task bar.p  pHow can I accomplish thisp  pIf I hide the main window ShowWindowSWHIDE, the task bar icon disappears. If I minimize the main window SWMINIMIZE, the icon remains. However, since the dialog is owned by the main window, this also hides the dialog.p  pAfter the dialog is created, clicking on the task bar icon makes the dialog visible. Naturally, I do not want to require the user to do this.p  pEven if I insert ShowWindowSWSHOW in the dialogs OnInit handler, the dialog remains not visible. Spy shows that its visible bit is set, though. Same is true if I add SetWindowActive to OnInit.p  pI am not interested in changing the UI design. While the dialog is active, the user interacts only with it, and is not interested in anything in the main window. Therefore, the main window should disappear.p  pUsing Windows VS2005 under WinXP32.p

Negative 72972 pIt is my understanding that parametric polymorphism is a technique which allows uniform actions over a variety of datatypes.

Negative 72972 pI never really got the chance to do anything with Microsoft ActiveX in all of my programming career. So, I have very little knowledge of what it is or what it is used for. Although Ive searched on the Internet for answer, I found many different definition for ActiveX or ActiveX Container. One of my customer is asking for ActiveX Container for my software which I dont have. He wants view or take control of my software remotely through this ActiveX Container. Is this possible Also, is ActiveX still around I am trying to see if I can put this ActiveX container real quick for him to use.p  pI am assuming that ActiveX is used to expose some part of your software to the Internet or the Intranet. So, that the user can get access to your application remotely.p  pAny response will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,p

Negative 72972 pI have a custom built control, which is a rectangle with a few details inside it, but it is a rectangle.p  pI have a center point X,Y, which I call Center of Gravity, which represents the point. This means that when I set a new position to the object, I want this point to be in the set position. When I rotate the object, I need it to rotate around this point. And when I scale the object, the point must remain in the position set before. Only the size of the object must change.p  pFor example, to have an easy picture of the problem, lets say I have a 10X10 square. I set the center of the gravity in the exact center of the square 5,5. Then I set the objects position to 100, 100. Then, the square would be inp  p95,95, 105,95, 105,105, 95,105, which means its center would be in the desired position.p  pIn case I scale the square with value 2, the new 4 points positions would bep  p90,90, 110,90, 110,110, 90,110, which means its center would remain in the desired position.p  pIn case I rotate it 45 degrees, it would rotate around its center with positionsp  p92.93,92.93,107.07,92.93,107.07,107.07,92.93,107.07p  pHow is it possible to do this, with its center fully configurable and all this transforms to be transparent for the program in WPF I would like only to set Scale, Position, Rotation Angle and center to have it drawn properly.p  pThank youp

Negative 72972 pIm working on creating a map of Day Z the game with leaflet JS and want  to be able to plot items on the map using the in game coordinate system see  a hrefhttpdayz.ollieb.net relnofollowhttpdayz.ollieb.netap  pIn game the top left coordinate is 000 000, then 001, 001 where units of 10 represent a grid so 010, 010 would be the top left grid similar to ordinance survey. p  pHow do I create a method to convert the provided coordinate systems either  points or latlong to work on this way.

Negative 72972 pI have been fiddling with code to call a function with the name of the value of a variable and then keep the this scope when called, but the this pointer seems to be in context of  the element I have used jQuerys bind method on, rather than the object the function I might be calling is within.

I have tried doing .apply with the appropriate this pointers, but they do not seem to work. p  pSo heres the question how do I change the context of the this pointer in combination with function pointers Feel free to scrap all the code I have written, as long as I am able to do a bind function to an element that then runs a method within a object where this is refferring to the object the method is within. p  pThanksp

Negative 72972 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2757107developingforandroidineclipserjavanotgeneratingDeveloping for Android in Eclipse R.java not generatinga  p blockquote    pIm using Ubuntu 12.04 with Eclipse Indigo I downloaded classic, and it poped up with that on the splash screen, so I guess thats it. I am trying to use the Android SDK with it. I downloaded all the SDKs possible from the interface, then added the Eclipse plugin. I created a project to mess around with Android stuff, and there are two errors. One error I fixed. The other was something like, R.java does not exist. I Googled it, and found other Stack Overflow questions similar to this one. I made a new one, because all the answers to the other questions didnt work. I tried cleaning my workspace and my project, I tried reinstalling the plugin and the SDK. Nothing worked. Is there anything Im missing to have Eclipse generate R.java I am also using the 32bit version of Ubuntu, if that makes a differece.p
Negative 72972 pIs there a chance to use the Apple Remote with my web browser Safari, Chrome or Firefox For example, my HTML page makes a transition if I click the right or left arrow. I want to cause this transition not only by pressing a key but also by clicking on my Apple Remote which is usually used with Frontrow.p  pThe condensed question is do I have the chance to catch Apple Remote events with JavaScriptp
Negative 72972 pI have a view that has many subviews and sublayers that are built up from a background thread using NSOperation. Then I invoked back to the main thread when adding them to the UIView that is already being displayed. When everything is done rendering, performance and responsiveness is great. However, the main thread seems to be taking a very long time to do the initial render of my views, causing performance issues while the initial render is taking place.p  pI was able to get around this performance issue if my NSOperation added the subviewssublayers to a currently visible UIView, but it would not appear until it was tapped on. Calling the setNeedsDisplay method did not resolve this issue.p  pI am wondering if their is a way to tell the main thread that I am adding a bunch of views so that it knows to do this more optimally Somthing similar to an addSubviewRange instead of addSubviewp
Negative 72972 pIm a student assistant, and my job is to help maintain and update websites and databases for part of the campus I work at. Most of the websites have not been developed by me, and Im pretty much a novice at a lot of the PHP, CSS and HTML components of my job. p  pWe have a PHP webpage with a tutor request form on it a hrefhttpssaswebts.sas.calpoly.edussstutorrequest.php relnofollowlinkanot being students at this campus, you wont be able to login to the page.... We took the form down during the summer and would now like to reopen it for the fall. emNone of the code has changed since we took the form down.em When we tried to bring it back up, the page loaded fine in IE and FF, but in chrome all of the content would appear, but none of the stylingit was just text on a white background. p  pThen, when we tried to use the form in IE or FF, it wouldnt work. After submitting a tutor request the user should be transported to a confirmation page, however the user just returns to the form, with none of the form data being sent to our database. p  pI believe the problem lies somewhere in the PHP but I dont know enough about that to see the problem. p  pHere is the code for the webpage p  precodeltphp requireonce..applicationprocessingconfig.php

Negative 72972 pIve got a night clock app and I want to disable the keyguard for the device while the app is running AND the device is on a charger. The idea is that if you are on a charger and this app is running then its reasonable to assume that you are in a safe location. When the app is exited either via back or home then I do NOT want the unlock screen to appear, just allow normal usage as if the phone was never idle for more than the devices lock time. p  pCurrently my app uses the FLAGSHOWWHENLOCKED window option and it nicely keeps the screen on and unlocked, but when I hit back or home after the lock time has expired I get the unlock keypad screen to unlock the device.

In terms of software engineering practices, I have to say I like the second approach better. Less code, fewer files, less clutter no interface class. More flexibility you can only implement a subset of the interface by setting some of the function objects and leaving the others null. Or you can have different parts of the interface implemented in separate classes or by free functions or combination of both instead of in a single subclass. Furthermore, CustomSocket can be used by any class not just subclasses of IMsgProcessor. This is a stronggreat advantagestrong, in my opinion. br What do you say Do you see any fundamental flaw in these argument p

After a fair bit of digging I discovered that SWIGed structure members did not seem to have their own independent reference counts even though the interpreter indicates they are Swig Objects.

The problem with this approach is   that in most cases Pig instantiates functions on the client side to,   for instance, examine the schema of the data.p      pUsers should not make assumptions about how many times a function is   instantiated instead, they should make their code resilient to   multiple instantiations.

Negative 72972 pIm going to be loading a billion rows into a mySQL table, one column of which  BINARY20  is the SHA1 hash of several other columns, concatenated.  Offhand I dont see how to use the LOAD command to load binary values, because it seems to rely upon delimiters.p  pObviously, speed is important here, which is why I want to use LOAD.  Does anyone know how to load a fixedlength binary value with LOAD  Is this perhaps a job for a trigger  Ive never used triggers before.  Or can I invoke a function e.g. UNHEX in the LOAD commandp  pSince it seems to be a common question no, I dont want to store it in base64 or hex notation.  BINARY20 is a requirement.p

Negative 72972 pI was wondering if the user has access to the codeSharedPreferencescode in which I store some app data. I intend to do a very simple counter which counts the number of times the user uses a feature in my app and if the value passes a certain predefined one, then I block the access to that feature. I do not intend to use a server to keep track of every such counter on every device which uses my app, but I would prefer to store this data locally.p  pThe question is how easily can the user access the codeSharedPreferencescode and remove the data I store, thus resetting the counter. Where exactly does the codeSharedPreferencescode get stored Is it easy to accessp  pIt is not THAT important if the user does manage to reset the counter, it is not a critical thing, but Id prefer to implement a simple method to at least discourage or make it a bit harder for himher to do so.p

Negative 72972 pI have an HTML form that includes typedate fields.  Each date field has a minmax value set as a basic sanity check since my users like to type into the form rather than use date pickers and they often type dates like 4170213.p  pThe form is submitted by a jquery ajax call which is triggered by a form submit.p  pAll users are using Chrome as a browser.p  pWhen they type in a date completely that is out of range, date range validation works as it should.  When they merely change the emyearem, or the year and one other part of the date month or day, but not both, in an existing date so that it ends up outside the valid range, Chrome does not give them a validation error.  Instead, it strongsilentlystrong corrects the year back to what it was previously so that it stays in the valid date range.  This results in garbage values getting silently submitted to the database.p  pIve tried writing my own validation routine in javascript, but it seems that the problem is that the underlying data value doesnt change to the invalid year, so trying to get it and check it is a waste of time.  As far as Chrome is concerned, the invalid year just wasnt typed.p  pDoes anyone know a workaround for thisp  pEDIT I have included some code to demonstrate part of the problem.p  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt   lttitlegtDate bug testlttitlegt   ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.9.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscriptgt     document.readyfunction       document.onsubmit, FORM, function         dateshow.htmlDate entered was    input[namefoo].val         return true                 ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltform actionjavascriptvoid0gt   ltinput typedate namefoo min19800101 max20800101 gt   ltinput typetext namebargt   ltinput typesubmitgt ltformgt ltdiv iddateshowgtltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pTo demonstratep  ul liSave this to an html file and open in Chromeli liEnter a date between 1980 and 2080 into the date field and submitli liDate will be shown as submitted.li liSelect strongONLY THE YEARstrong in the date field and change it to a value outside the valid rangeli liClick submit again.li liNote that the date submitted emdoes not changeem, even though your invalid date still shows in the form control.  li ul

Negative 72972 pTo the best of my knowledge,   p  blockquote   pthe operation is resides in the second compartment of class at class diagram.p blockquote  pThe following is codeBehavior definitioncode from UML specificationAugust 2011  ,page 445p  blockquote   p13.3.2 Behavior from BasicBehaviorsp      pBehavior is a specification of how its context classifier changes   state over time. This specification may be either a definition of   possible behavior execution or emergent behavior, or a selective   illustration of an interesting subset of possible executions. The   latter form is typically used for capturing examples, such as a trace   of a particular execution. A classifier behavior is always a   definition of behavior and not an illustration. It describes the   sequence of state changes an instance of a classifier may undergo in   the course of its lifetime. Its precise semantics depends on the kind   of classifier. For example, the classifier behavior of a collaboration   represents emergent behavior of all the parts, whereas the classifier   behavior of a class is just the behavior of instances of the class   separated from the behaviors of any of its parts. When a behavior is   associated as the method of a behavioral feature, it defines the   implementation of that feature i.e., the computation that generates   the effects of the behavioral feature.p blockquote  p1Could you please explain what behavior means in the above definition p  p2What is the differences  between Behavior and operation in unified Modeling LanguageUMLp

Negative 72972 pMy understanding of how data transfer happens in tcphttp is thisp  pThe application layer on the server side passes some data to the tcp layer to be sent to the client. The tcp layer breaks the application data into segments and sends it further. The tcp layer on the other end will ensure that it receives and arranges all the segments in order before passing them to its application layer.p  pNow, codein the case of nonpersistent connectionscode, the server can simply close the connection when it is done sending data. What does this mean Does it mean the server will send a codeFINcode segment at the end So, the clients tcp layer will basically wait for all the segments upto the FIN segment, pass this data to the upper layers and proceed with connection termination.p  pcodeIn the case of persistent connectionscode, as the connection is not closed by the server, it is said that the client cannot know when it has to finish reading the response and do the next request. And so the codecontentlengthcode header and codechunked transfercode are used.p  pMy question is strongwhy cant we just send a segment similar to FIN say DONE to indicate that the server has transmitted all the responsestrong. The client on seeing DONE can start with the next request. What was the need to include a contentlength header which comes with the issue of knowing the content length in advancep  pI am sure I have misunderstood or missed something here. Please correct me where I am wrong above.p  pThanks for reading upto here p

Negative 72972 pMy understanding is that the reason why there are raw types and type erasure in Java is that because at the time generics was introduced, there were standard APIs that could not be made generic without breaking existing code.p  pGenerics was also introduced to .NET at some point down the road, but this feature was implemented in a manner that does not rely on raw types or type erasure and if it does, it does so in a manner that is transparent to the user. So existing APIs remained unchanged for example, the code in the System.Collections namespace and new, generic APIs were introduced for example, the code in the System.Collections.Generic namespace.p  pSo how come Java generics, unlike .NET generics, requires raw types  type erasurep

I want to automatically change up my service calls endpoints depending on whether I am sending web service RESTful requests to a. development server b. staging server c. production serverp  pFor example, p  precodea. dev url httpwww.dev.camerakingphotosgetAllPhotos b. test url httpwww.test.camerakingphotosgetAllPhotos c. production url httpwww.camerkingphotosgetAllPhotos codepre  ol lipHow do I tell XCode to switch URLs to my production server vs development server effortlessly  Is it a build setting, a preprocessor macro, a scheme, or a new target I think a new target is not what I want.  Ideally XCode would know that right now Im testing a development version of my app, so I want all of the URLs to point to the development server.  And I want to tell XCode that Im now ready to test my app to point to production, so use the URLs that correspond to the production server.pli lipIf I define a preprocessor macro, where would I do so  I have an APPCONSTANTS.h file that is the single place where all my service URLs are stored.  Do I define a preprocessor macro in my APPCONSTANTS.h file or in a Prefix.pch filepli lipWould anyone care to spell out a detailed example for me  pli ol  pIve looked around stackoverflow but I would appreciate someone putting all the pieces together, explicitly for me, that does not assume too much prior knowledge.  I perused the XCode build guide most of it but I saw the trees only and not the forest. p  pThanksp

Negative 72972 pI have a newb question, which I have tried unsuccessfully to find answers for on the web.  The task is simple I want to create a core data documentbased app but alter the values in some label objects.  Using interface builder, I can build the core data model and populate it, using an array controller, table, etc. all without writing any code.  So far so good.  My test example is to build a core data model with Box entities that have length and width attributes.  I would like a label to display the area, i.e. lengthwidth for any geometrically challenged .  p  pSo after browsing around, Ive decided I need to create an NSWindowController subclass and use that to update the label when a box in the table is selected.  Have attempted this, but have failed.  Before I even hook up the label to the window controller, I have a problem.  Following the template comments, I added this to Document.mp  precode voidmakeWindowControllers      NSLogAdding custom Window Controller     MyWindowController myWindowController  [[MyWindowController alloc] init]     [self addWindowControllermyWindowController]  codepre  pAlso added this to the template MyWindowController.mp  precode idinit      self  [super initWithWindowNibNameMyWindowController]     return self  codepre  pThe window controller has its own NIB file from Interface builder where I put the table and label etc.  The file owner is set to MyWindowController.  Probably forgetting other things, but thats what I remember for now.p  pThe log message appears at startup, but then I get an exception this class is not key value codingcompliant for the key managedObjectContext before the window appears.  Im guessing that I dont have the window controller hooked up to the document class properly  My other thought is that the array controller is in the window controller nib, not the document nib, so maybe its looking in the wrong place for the managedObjectContext  p

Negative 72972 pIm using Sortable within AngularUI to manage multiple sortable lists.

Negative 72972 pCurrently I am using a simple query for FullText search in my website and feel it isnt the absolute best solution for my searching needs. While it may meet my needs now, and is relatively easy to setup, I get the feeling that implementing one of the more well known search solutions is probably best. I am expecting this site to grow and have thousands of records in my database.  Therefore, I am curious as to what is considered best practice in the searching community. At the moment I am looking into Lucene.NET, but it seems rather extensive and might be difficult to incorporate at this stage in development. Any suggestionsp

Negative 72972 pemstrongTLDR I want to hack the internals of CKEditor so that it produces an alternate format for rich text instead of HTML, and Id like an opinion from an expert regarding the feasibility of that idea.strongemp  pIm working on a project that requires a collaborative richtext editor like Google Docs, and Im planning on using an operational transform library a hrefhttpsharejs.orgShareJSa to implement it. But operational transform is difficult to implement with HTML because of tagnesting rules. For example, a naive OT implementation would be prone to producing this kind of garbagep  precodeltbgtoverlapping bold ltigtandltbgt italic text.ltigt codepre  pThe correct way to represent such text in HTML would be something more like thisp  precodeltbgtoverlapping bold ltbgt ltbgtltigtandltigtltbgt ltigt italic text.ltigt codepre  pOr better yet, something like thisp  precodeltspan classboldgtoverlapping bold ltspangt ltspan classbold italicgtandltspangt ltspan classitalicgt italic text.ltspangt codepre  pBut, to get those kinds of representations, the OT implementation needs to know all the rules of HTML tagnesting and how to correct erroneous merges.p  pIve been thinking about a possible solution using an alternate form of markup that doesnt enforce tagnesting rules at all. Something like thisp  precodeBOLD start 0, length 20 ITALIC start 17, length 16 TEXToverlapping bold and italic text. codepre  pUsing a format like that, I could use a plainvanilla OT library to manage the ongoing diffrebasemerge operations, and then transform the resultant document into HTML at the last moment before updating the GUI on both sides of the collaboration.p  pThe easiest way to implement this would be to ask CKEditor for its HTML output and then reconstruct the document in the new format afterthefact. But OT would require me to perform that transformation on every keypress, and that seems a little too heavyweight. For performance reasons, I wonder whether it would be possible to override the default HTML writer within CKEditor, asking it to produce an alternate format as it walks the DOM.p  pWhat do you thinkp

Negative 72972 pId like to apply a new function to the same set of cells referenced in a previously used function. For instance, in my specific case, cell J73 contains the single function p  pcodeSUMG68G73,G64G66,G62,G59G60,G55G57,G48G53,G46,G36G38,G40G44codep  pand I would like to use the COUNT function on the same set of cells without individually selecting them again, in order to display how many values went into the result of the SUM function. In other words, I would like to end up with cell K74 containingp  pcodeCOUNTG68G73,G64G66,G62,G59G60,G55G57,G48G53,G46,G36G38,G40G44codep  pI also will have to do this 150 times with varying sets and numbers of cells, so copying and pasting the arguments by hand would also be highly time consuming. It seems like there must be a general way to reference the argument of one function in another, but it is proving very hard to search for.p  pEdit To be clear, in my particular case, all of the cells like J73 above sums of multiple series of data are already present in my sheet so using fixed references would have been useful if I had originally included them, but are not especially useful now. In my ideal world, there would be a simple formula that pulls just the argument out of the first set of cells so I can quickly create a new column that shows how many pieces of information went into each of the cells using the SUM function. Unfortunately, this doesnt exactly appear to be the case, but it looks like there may be several promising workarounds.p

Negative 72972 pMy question is different than a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15043976oocssseparationofcontainerandcontentthis onea, but its regarding the same principle, so this quote is relevant here toop  pfrom a hrefhttpsgithub.comstubbornellaoocsswiki relnofollowhttpsgithub.comstubbornellaoocsswikiap  blockquote   pEssentially, this means rarely use locationdependent styles. An object should look the same no matter where you put it. So instead of styling a specific h2 with .myObject h2 ..., create and apply a class that describes the h2 in question, like h2 classcategory.p blockquote  pBut what if the design dictates that an objects style changes when its inside certain containers Heres a simplified example of my problem. Lets say theres an object called foo, and a container object called bar. foo and bar have their own locationindependent stylesp  precode.foo      ...  .bar      ...  codepre  pBut when foo is inside container bar like so, its color needs to change when the user hovers over barp  precodeltdiv classbargt     ...     ltdiv classfoogt         ...     ltdivgt     ... ltdivgt codepre  pIt seems in this case, you cant avoid writing a locationdependent selector that looks like thisp  precode.barhover .foo       color style  codepre  pOne solution I thought of is to introduce a class thats explicitly dependent on bar named using a hrefhttpcoding.smashingmagazine.com20120416anewfrontendmethodologybem relnofollowBEM naming conventiona to be explicit about parentchild relationship, and add it to the foo objectp  precodeltdiv classbargt     ...     ltdiv classfoo barfoogt         ...     ltdivgt     ... ltdivgt  .barhover .barfoo       color style  codepre  pI want to confirm, is this a good way to handle the issue Are there other ways in OOCSS as well p
Negative 72972 pI have a timer in my application timer1. When this timer goes off, it calls a sub that refreshes my datagridview. Before calling the refresh sub, I use GetActiveWindow from user32 Lib to check If the form is the active window. This works as expected. Here is the code I am using to check the active window. p  precodeIf Me.Handle  GetActiveWindow Then     gridRefresh Else     MessageBox.ShowWorks End If codepre  pI included the messagebox just to give me a visual that It is indeed working when the active window is not my Application. p  pWhat I am missing though is I would like to call the gridRefresh sub once my Application becomes the active window again. p  pMy first thought would be to use a Do Until loop and have it do nothing until It becomes the active window again like sop  precodeIf Me.Handle  GetActiveWindow Then     gridRefresh Else     Do Until Me.Handle  GetActiveWindow      Loop     gridRefresh End If codepre  pBut when I try this solution It never comes out of the loop. p  pEdit The timer interval is 1 minute. The reason I want it to refresh once it becomes active again is so the user doesnt have to wait a whole minute to see if anything has been added to the gridviewp

Negative 72972 pI have a custom subclass of UIView, designed in IB that contains a few labels and a button.  There is an action for touchUpInside event on the button and the target is the custom view. p  pI am attaching this custom view to a self.tableView.tableHeaderView for a tableview in my UI.p  pThe strange thing is this custom view is not responding to touches. I can see it nicely with all the labels and the button in side the table view, that means the table view handles and shows it correctly, however it is not responding to touches.  I checked the whole view hierarchy and all the views involved have userInteractionEnabled as YES.  If i drag some other controls into that custom view for example a switch, segmented control..they do not respond as well. It is like these controls in custom view are not registering touches.p  pIt doesnt make any sense. I am out of ideas. Can you help to allow the touch event on the button to arrive to its parent viewp

So for example, below is a zoom of 75.

What browser are you using Does it happen in every browser  This bug has occurred in the following browsers, on both MacOS and Windows platforms FireFox, Chrome, Safari, IE not sure what version. All of the browsers were upgraded to their latest versionsp  pB. Why exactly do you care about the windows zoom for the project This simulation is being presented at a conference in Atlanta in front of a lot of big whigs in the world of Mathematics, in hopes that one of them will fund the creation of an exhibit at the Museum of Mathematics. This code is a simulation of what the future exhibit will model, which is a Programmable Galton Board. Anyhow, we the research group want to be sure that this bug will not show up on the day of presentation, as a peace of mind. Because it would be awful to get on stage and realize that the projection screen distorts dimensions in a way that we would need to zoom out in order to run the simulation, and BOOM. The bug. p  pThank you all This simulation needs to be done within a week so any immediate answers are greatly appreciated p

Negative 72972 pI feel this is a very basic question, still I cant figure out a good way of doing it even though Ive worked quite a bit with databases. Also cant seem to find anything when googling for it.p  pLets say I have a bunch of tables, each describing a type of item.p  pFor instancep  precodeTable candles id  name  lengthdiameterburntime  1  candle154      6       180    69 candle229      16      145    80 candle3100    40       110      Table coasters id  name  thicknessdiametercolor     1 coaster15          20    ffffff  6 coaster28          41    ff0051  8 coaster37         38     002199    Table baskets id  name  size  1 basket1 5    2 basket2 8    3 basket3 22   codepre  pNow I have another table. Lets call it shoppingcarts. Each record in this table needs to hold an array of these items. This is where I dont know how to proceed. So I need a many to many relationship, which means I need a junctionpivottable. But howp  pShould I have one junctiontable for each type of item With a foreign key for cartid and one for the recordid for candlecoasteretc. Then when listing the content of the cart I need to check every single junctiontable, one for each type of item. Doesnt sound very clean to me.p  pOr should I only have one single junctiontable, which has a column for tablename and one for recordid Seems very dirty too.p  pI suppose theres a much better way of doing this, but I cant think of it. How should this be donep

So unless I specify some slice that is ridiculously large, this connection will always close, though this seems wasteful. I was wondering, is it possible to keep a connection without having to know the length of the message before hand I would love a solution to my specific problem, but I feel that this question is more general. Why do I need to know the length before hand Cant the library just give me a slice of the correct sizep  pOr what other solution do people suggestp

want something thats more intelligent. At this point I dont even know how the URL is generated it does seem static for now and its probably a real file not just in time generated file.p  pTurns out the codechallengecode page which gives the challenge for the image is just a decoy challenge.. that challenge then gets replaced encrypted perhaps clientsided using variables t1, t2, t3, seems this encryption is not used each time, if you pass it once you get access to do what I am trying to do pretty much my code works but it stops working at very random intervals, I want something more solid which I can leave unattended for weeks.p

Negative 72972 pWhen you install Joomla extensions, they may put files into the Components, Modules, Plugins, Media, Images, and possibly other directories. Also, they may save configuration information in some or all of these directories. p  pIn other words, Joomla does not have a clean separation of Core, Third Party, and Local files.  This makes it impossible to manually overwrite a Joomla installation, because you dont want to stomp on any of these files. Coming from Drupal, this is craaazynotbestpracticep  pIs there a way to manually update JUST the Joomla core filesp  pIs there a way to manually update JUST the 3rdParty extension files Yeah, they might be all over the placep  pIm presently cleaning up a bunch of sites infected with a base64decode hack. Mixing core files with 3rdParty with configuration, makes it very difficult to clean things up.p
Negative 72972 pAlthough searching for awhile, I can not find any clear answer of what benefits there is for compiling 64bit programs over 32 bit.  There are many questions I find on SO on how to compile for 32 or 64 bit, and some questions about the 64bit versions of opengl, but they do not address the base question of why.  p  pFrom what I find, it is difficult to use the MinGW compiler for 64 bit as there doesnt seem to be an official release from QT.  Currently I use MinGW 32 bit for making a 3d opengl application that is heavily focused on speed with large sets of vertices using VBO to handle it.  I assume I would switch to visual studio for windows releases, and maybe use unofficial releases of 64bit for other platforms.p  pSince I have yet to find an OS which the compiled 32 bit version does not work, but since the target deployment of my application will be primarily on high end computers in research environments, I am fine with releasing 64 bit versions.p  pIf the code is the same, is there a distinct advantage to switching the compiler from 32 to 64 bit for an application using Qt 5 and OpenGL p

For my use case, I have a codeStreamTcpcode based codeFlowcode that is being fed from binding the input stream of connections to my server socket.  The Flow that I have is based on codeByteStringcode data coming into it.  The data that is coming in is going to have a delimiter in it that means I should treat everything before the delimiter as one message and everything after and up to the next delimiter as the next message.  So playing around with a simpler example, using no sockets and just static text, this is what I came up withp  precodeimport akka.actor.ActorSystem import akka.stream.

I then process each subflow with another pipeline of steps, finally printing the individual messages at the end.p  pThis all seems a bit verbose, to accomplish what I thought to be a pretty simple and common use case.

Negative 72972 pAssume that I implemented a kernel driver that parses RX packet and decides to pass it to the user space depending on EthType. What are the official ways to do that in the Linux kernelp  pThe only one that comes on my mind is the user application opens a socket to the kernel and listens on it, while the kernel pushes packets satisfying criteria eg. specific EthType in to the sockets buffer. Im certainly not accurate about this, but I hope you get my point p  pAre there any other ways to do thisp  pThanks.p

I observed that only one active task or at most two tasks are running on onetwo machines at any point of time while the other are sitting idle.

Why are all nodes not being used for large tasks of a single job Does having HBase on a separate machine has anything to do with thisp

Negative 72972 pIm trying to add an object using a PartialView inside a popup. Its a simple Rental application for which the data model was generated Model First through Entity Framework. The Controllers and Views have mostly been Scaffolded by EF. The relationship between RentalApplication and RentalObject is 1 to many, meaning a RentalObject always has to have 1 RentalApplication.p  pMy controller looks like thisp  precode GET CalendarAdd1  Create a PartialView using a RentalObject as the model.   Use the provided ID to lock in the RentalApplication.

This works so far, the popup dialog shows the values PricePerHour and Currency from the RentalApplication.p  pHowever, when I submit the form in my PartialView popup everything gets copied over BUT the RentalApplication object. It somehow ends up creating a new RentalObject object using the PricePerHour and Currency from the original RentalApplication, but doesnt include the  object itself under the RentalApplication property. My debugger even goes to the first constructor for RentalObject.p  pSo I guess its having trouble keeping a complex object inside another object when submitted from controller to view GET and back to controller POST. Is this just poor practice on my part Should I be using a ViewModelp

I think that the issue is something like below blue is what I think is the way my tiles are being detected, whereas the red is how they ideally should be detected for accurate roaming movement on the tiles p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTqO2J.png altReference Screenshotp  pAs you can see, the boolean that checks the tile I am stood on which takes the pixel central to the players feet, the player will later be a car and take a pixel based on the direction of movement is returning false and denying movement in several scenarios, as well as letting the player move in some places that shouldnt be allowed. p  pI think that its because the cutoff areas of each texture are I think being considered part of the grid area, so when the player is in one of these corner areas it is not truly checking the correct tile, and so returning the wrong results.p  pThe code Im using for creating the grid is thisp  precodeint VisualComponentTileConversionTile tileToConvert, bool xOrY      int X  tileToConvertgtx  tileToConvertgty  64 change 64 to TILEWIDTHHALF     int Y  tileToConvertgtx  tileToConvertgty  25      int X  tileToConvertgtx  128  2  tileToConvertgty  128  2  100     int Y  tileToConvertgty  50  2  tileToConvertgtx  50  2  100 if xOrY      return X  else      return Y    codepre  pand the code for checking the players movement isp  precodebool ClsentityCheckMovementTileint xpos, int ypos, ClsMapData mapData check if the movement will end on a legitimate road tile UNOPTIMISED AS RUNS EVERY FRAME FOR EVERY TILE      int x  xpos  7 get the center bottom pixel as this is more suitable than the first on an iso grid more realistic foot placement     int y  ypos  45      int mapX  x  64  y  25  2 64 is TILEWIDTH HALF and 25 is TILE HEIGHT      int mapY  y  25  x  64  2  for int i  0 i lt mapDatagttilesList.size i for each tile of the map  if mapDatagttilesList[i]gtx  mapX ampamp mapDatagttilesList[i]gty  mapY if there is an existing tile that will be entered  if mapDatagttilesList[i]gtmovementTile      HAPIgtDebugTextstdtostringmapX   is the x and the y is   stdtostringmapY     return true    return false  codepre  pIm a little stuck on progression until having this fixed in the game loop aspect of things. If anyone thinks they either know the issue from this or might be able to help itd be great and I would appreciate it. For reference also, my tile textures are 128x64 pixels and the math behind drawing them to screen treats them as 128x50 to cleanly link together.p

Negative 72972 pCurrently I have Flask application deployed by using CunicornNginx. There are multiple other ways to deploy python web applications as well  a hrefhttpflask.pocoo.orgdocs0.10deploying relnofollowhttpflask.pocoo.orgdocs0.10deployinga p  pThe problem that I have is that any internal server error500 crashes the whole server which will stay in crashed state until I manually restart Cunicorn. It is quite normal that application sometimes has internal server errors even though the code wouldnt have any bugs e.g. when database server is not available for some time. In these situations it would naturally be desired that the application container would automatically continue working normally when e.g. database becomes available again.p  pSo far I have found only this solution  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6790156gunicorninternalservererrorsGunicorn Internal Server Errorsa  which keeps making requests and checking whether application has crashed and restarts it in case it has.

This class holds the UI that allows the user to select the device to connect. I need to pass that device to class A or have access to connectBluetoothBluetoothDevice deviceToConnect so that the main activity can start with it. I have tried using wrapper methods but it always results in the method needing to be static, which doesnt let me use connectBluetoothBluetoothDevice deviceToConnect because its an abstract protected method.p  pWhat can I do to solve this problem Does it require another class Or am I just missing somethingp  pThanksp

Negative 72972 pwhat is a way to add elements of array thats sum would equal the largest element in the array p  pexample for this array  [4, 6, 23, 10, 1, 3] I have sorted the array first resulting in [1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 23] then I pop the last digit or the last element max  23. Im left with [1, 3, 4, 6, 10] and need a way to find a way to find the elements that add up to 23 which are 3  4  6  10  23. The elements dont have to be subsequent they can be at random points of the array but they must add up to max. p  pI can find the permutations of the sorted array from 2 elements to n1 elements and sum them and compare them to max but that seems inefficient. plz helpp

Negative 72972 pWe use a central class model for a wide variety of python modules. This model is defined using SQLAlchemy. The classes all inherit from declarativebase. p  pFor example, our model definitions look something like thisp  precodeBase  declarativebase  class PostBase     tablename  Posts     id  ColumnINT, primarykeyTrue, autoincrementTrue     body  ColumnTEXT     timestamp  ColumnTIMESTAMP     userid  ColumnINT, ForeignKeyUsers.uid codepre  pWe have been building a flask webapplication in which we employ this same model. We have discovered a tricky problem in that flasksqlalchemy appears to be designed in such a way that it expects all classes used in its model to have been defined by passing in an active instance of the session. Here is an example of a proper flasksqalchemy class model definitionp  precodeapp  Flaskname app.config[SQLALCHEMYDATABASEURI]  sqlitetmptest.db db  SQLAlchemyapp   class Userdb.Model     id  db.Columndb.Integer, primarykeyTrue     username  db.Columndb.String80, uniqueTrue     email  db.Columndb.String120, uniqueTrue codepre  pNote that the above example for flasksqlalchemy requires an alreadyinstantiated sql session. This has horrified us, because we are completely at a loss as to how to integrate our SqlAlchemy model into flask. We really want to use the flasksecurity suite in particular.p  pThis problem has been brought up before on SO. Here, for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19119725howtouseflasksqlalchemywithexistingsqlalchemymodelrq1How to use flasksqlalchemy with existing sqlalchemy modelap  pOur requirements are different from those of whoever accepted the response there. The response points out that one loses the ability to use User.query, but this is precisely one of the things we must retain.p  pIt is not feasible to abandon our nice, elegant, central class model definition in favor of what flasksqlalchemy appears to require. Is there any way for us to associate our model with the SQLAlchemy object Bonus points for getting us the .query method on our classes which appears to be required by flasksecurity.p

The codeUIViewcode also has all four similar constraints. The second codeUILabelcode has its height set to 0 programmatically since more than a screenful of text is shown here. Also, these four pin constraints have also been set up from the codeUIViewcode to codeUIScrollViewcode.p  pWhen the XIB is loaded, this codeUILabelcode shows long lines of text correctly.

If you see carefully at the end of the screenshot, the codeUILabelcodes text seems to overflow past the codeUIViewcode.p  pI suspect that because the codeUIViewcode cannot capture the size of its subviews, the codeUIScrollViewcode cannot calculate its contentsize tootheres no reason for the scrollbar to work if its content view is only equal to one screen. Why is this happening even when the codeUILabelcode is clearly a subview of the codeUIViewcode If my suspicions are right, stronghow do I set the codeUIViewcodes height equal to the actual content size so that my codeUILabelcode is properly contained in itstrongp  pSetting the codeUIViewcodes height,width statically is not an option .p  pNB Tested the XIB without the codeUIViewcode and only a single codeUILabelcode with long text inside a codeUIScrollViewcode.

Negative 72972 pI am trying to use arrayfire for a project I am working on. I have an array of voltages that are generated for a set of synapses. Each synapse maps to a given neuron, but it can do so randomly. I need to add up all the voltages for a given synapse and place the totals in another array that corresponds to each neuron. I have come up with some code that will perform this calculation on only the synapses that are actually used and sum everything up nicely like I want. I am left with an array of neuron indices and an array of summed synaptic voltages. However, I have gotten stuck there. I cannot figure out a way to get the synaptic voltages back into the slot that corresponds to its neuron using the gfor loop syntax. I can do it if I use a regular for loop, but that would be very slow.

Negative 72972 pI have hit a roadblock in my access form and Ive searched high and low for an answer.  I have a form Enter Numbers in which users enter information that obviously is stored in a table Numbers.  I need to have a field  of models in the numbers table, however, I dont want to ask the users to input that information.  Furthermore, in another table property info I have that information already inputted.  Now before you tell me that it is redundant...blah blah blah, to store the same information in two tables.....the  of models field in the property info table may change, whereas by storing that number in the numbers table each time users enter info in the form, Im getting a snapshot that will not change. p  pI have a textbox that uses a dlookup function to pull the  of models from the property info table and displays it in the form.  I had and have no clue why it no longer functions properly a button in the form, that when pushed would run the following code  text66  models  Then I had a docmd.close so that it would put the dlookup result located in field models into text66 whose control source is the field  of models in the numbers table.  This was functioning flawlessly, and then something happened, and now when I click the button I receive a you cant assign a value to this object error.p  pI dont care by what method I copy the dlookup result into the numbers table, but I would certainly appreciate any help in doing so  Thanks.p

Also please note that Ive seen a lot of previous questions, but I didnt find any answer to this problem, so I asked my own question. If youve seen an answered question that can solve my problem you can link it here, but keep in mind that I am not experienced with Android or Java, so it might be unclear to me. I would preffer correct code as an answer, and a brief explaination why my didnt work. Also, I need to know if the phone is connected to the INTERNET, not a NETWORK, so ConnectivityManager wont wor for me.p  pEDIT  thank you all for your answers.

Negative 72972 pIm working on my class project which is a simple petri net app. So I created a custom views PlaceView, TransitionView and ArcView. And I have the strange problem with the last one, it works fine when Im connecting views statically but I want my PlaceView and TransitionView to be draggable so the ArcView which is connecting those two views must requestLayout to measure again coordinates. However when Im dragging a placeView and calling requestLayout on ArcView after PlaceView has been moved its not acting like it should, please take a look at the screenshot below, it looks like the line is only drew on placeView canvas. Any ideas how to solve it Here is the code for my ArcView, basically its width and height is always set to matchparent and onMeasure it calculates coordinates of the views to be connectedp  precodeOverride     protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec          super.onMeasurewidthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec          ifplacenull  transition  null return          determine from which view we should start drawing the line         ifplace.getToplttransition.getTop             startX  place.getLeft             startY  place.getTop             endX  transition.getLeft             endY  transition.getTop              draw the line from the center of the views             startX  startX  place.getWidth2             startY  startY  place.getHeight2             endX  endX  transition.getWidth2             endY  endY  transition.getHeight2           else              startX  transition.getLeft             startY  transition.getTop             endX  place.getLeft             endY  place.getTop              draw the line from the center of the views             startX  startX  transition.getWidth2             startY  startY  transition.getHeight2             endX  endX  place.getWidth2             endY  endY  place.getHeight2                  setMeasuredDimensionwidthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec           Override     protected void onDrawCanvas canvas          ifplacenull  transition  null return         canvas.drawLinestartX, startY, endX, endY, paint        codepre  pAnd here is the part where Im dragging my PlaceView all views are inside FrameLayoutp  precodeplace.setOnTouchListenernew View.OnTouchListener              Override             public boolean onTouchView v, MotionEvent event                  switch event.getAction                      case MotionEvent.ACTIONDOWN                         difference  event.getRawY  v.getTop                         break                     case MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE                         FrameLayout.LayoutParams params  FrameLayout.LayoutParams v.getLayoutParams                         params.topMargin  int event.getRawYdifference                         params.leftMargin  int event.getRawX                         v.setLayoutParamsparams                         v.invalidate                         ar.requestLayout                          break                     case MotionEvent.ACTIONUP                         break                                  return true                       codepre  pAnd here are the screenshots with the normal behavior and a weird onep  pa hrefhttp4.ii.glWyGOHUgGh.png relnofollowhttp4.ii.glWyGOHUgGh.pnga a hrefhttp4.ii.glFSlJu88Dl.png relnofollowhttp4.ii.glFSlJu88Dl.pngap  pAnd one more thing I know I have two clear my canvas for my next line to be drawn however thats another question, I want to know first why is this happeningp  pthanks for helpp

Negative 72972 pI have recently switched to emVIMem using emNERDTreeem and empythonmodeem.

And if I hit codeltogtcode in the same situation emVIMem adds another buffer but adds a new window in a horizontal split.p  pHow can I add multiple filesbuffers to the buffer list and only show the last added buffer in the active window without new splits using emnetrwem editedp  pThanks in advance I hope I havent missed something trivial from the manual.. p

Negative 72972 pSo, just like my previous question I want to make buycapability attribute of agents. This attribute consists of three categories which are high middle and low. There are three threshold values of this buycapability which are  50 low, 50mlt100 middle and 100 high that are determined by two sliders. Besides, agent stays on a patch that has landprice attribute. So, the buycapability will be determined by landprice and threshold values. For example, if the landprice of agents patch is greater than 100slider buycapabilityhigh value then agents buycapability is high and so on just like in procedure tosetincomeresident. Below code is the code that I use so far, to create or make the buycapability categorization. But unfortunately, the result of this code is all buycapability attribute af agents are low, there is no other than that.

Negative 72972 pWe have an Android app that we would like to make brandable by building certain clients customized external APKs containing resources for our app to use in place of its default colors and images.p  pAfter investigating a variety of different ways of getting the resources out of this external APK and into the main app, Ive settled on using ContentProviderContentResolver along with a contract class specifying some constants for elements Id like to make brandable ie, skinnable. For the first pass, the only elements we care about are the logo on the main screen, a few icons, and the foreground and background colors throughout the various layouts.p  pFor the logo images, since our Activities extend our own base activity, I opted to add a SkinDrawable annotation and handle some annotation processing to automatically look up a resource using a ContentResolver and replace the Drawable on an ImageView to which the annotation is applied.  This works well.p  pWhere Im running into some trouble is with foreground and background colors, however.  Since themes are immutable, I cant look up some color values via the ContentResolver and make changes to the Theme.  I also dont want to package every possible theme with our main app, and of course because of how Android does things, it isnt like I can move a theme across using the ContentResolverProvider.p  pIts easy enough to make foregroundbackground color changes on the root view, but Im struggling with how to deal with the cases of all the various components eg, TextViews, Buttons, EditTexts, ListViews containing other Views, etc without significantly polluting our code with loads of setTextColor, setForegroundColor, etc calls.p  pIve looked through some of the older answers, and most of them seem to be doing some variant on exactly this either using factory methods or having lots of theming logic inside the Activity code or subclassing every View class with a custom implementation... all of these things are things I could do, but they seem clumsy.p  pSo my question is this is there a better or cleaner way than these optionsp

Negative 72972 pIm making a database for a personal project and as a part of it, I want to represent certain tables in a specific way.p  pBasically, I want the user to be able to input their own questions and allow questions to appear during different times. And a user should be able to respond multiple times to a question, while also distinguishing their responses by time.p  pSo, effectively we have four tables Person, Response, Question, Time. p  pThe way I am envisioning it is there is a relationship between Question and Time, lets call it QT. And then there is a tertiary relationship between Person, Response and QT. That depiction makes the most sense for what Im looking for, but I dont know if its legal in ER diagrams, andor how that would best translate to table form.p

I cant work out if this is because I am not defining and implementing the sort definition properly or because Im expecting too much from it.  There is no Comparator implementation in the BookBean object.  I guess this is what I would need to do if I wanted to do the sort myself and not bother with the PagedListHolder sorting.  p  pCan anyone tell me if there is a way I can do the sorting in the PagedListHolder without implementing the Comparator interface or is this why the above code isnt sorting by title p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 72972 pIm currently working on a dumb down version of iTunes in which tracks can be imported, modified, exported, etc. This is my first largescale programming project using any language. Ive structured the process of changing imported tracks in such a way that each time a track is modified its deleted from the Treeview Widget and the updated version is reinserted. So tracks are constantly getting new IDs which I make sure to keep updated throughout my entire program. My question, is this an okay way of updating information. Do you think this will lead to any performance issues And are there better more elegant ways of accomplishing the same goal How would I go about just editing the rows Right now I can edit them but the updated content doesnt reflect in the Treeview. self.tree.update doesnt seem to do anything either.
