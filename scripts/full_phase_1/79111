Positive 79111 pIve been using 1.1 on Win 10. When 1.2 came out, I tried upgrading but it actually falled back to 0.3. According to sashko a reinstall was necessary, which solved the problem for some. However, nothing happened when I uninstalled and rerun the installer. No files were actually modified. Deleting the localappdata.meteor folder didnt help either. As the installer would no longer put anything there.p  pThe farthest I could get is to get a dev build with a git clone, but Id like to use a release version either 1.1 or 1.2. Otherwise Im not able to update my project with a checkout meteor build.p  pWrote a bunch of comments on other threads but none of the suggestions helped thus far, so I thought this deserves a new separate thread.p

Negative 79111 pI have a .NET application distributed through codeClickOncecode. Security within the application is implemented through the codeWindowsPrincipal.IsInRoleGroupNamecode method using a set of groups as resources. This structure works well for us for users within the same domain as the groups. Unfortunately we now have users that need to use the application working on machines and using user accounts in a different domain that is trusted by our domain but is not in the same forest. p  pIt seems that codeIsInRolecode queries the AD ticket on the local machine for group membership. Unfortunately this ticket only contains domainlocal groups for the domain of the machine and global and universal groups of other trusted domains, our groups are domainlocal groups in the first domain. The catch22 situation comes from the fact that AD does not allow foreign security principals in either global or universal groups and therefore while it can be queried by the users in the second domain they cannot be members of it making it a little pointlessp  pTo explain There are two domains DOM1 and DOM2 with a trust setup between them, but they are not in the same forest.p  precodeDOM1User1 DOM2User2 codepre  pare two users.p  pI would like to put both codeUser1code and codeUser2code in one group that is visible to both users and can contain them both.p  pThe only way I can currently see around it is the following where  denotes the members of the groups, DLDomain Local and GLOGlobalGroup.p  pMake two global groups one in each domain  p  precodeDOM1GLOGroup1  DOM1User1   DOM2GLOGroup1  DOM2User2 codepre  pand two domainlocal groups containing the two global groups  p  precodeDOM1DLGroup1  DOM1GLOGroup1, DOM2GLOGroup1   DOM2DLGroup1  DOM1GLOGroup1, DOM2GLOGroup1 codepre  pBut this isnt really acceptable as we actually have more than two domains and about 70 groups to administer including a hierarchy of groups and we dont have much direct control over the administration of groups in the other domains.p  pWe havent yet worked through any thinking on an approach using LDAP but from the little that Ive read I believe its not generally recommended for this purposep

Negative 79111 pI thought I asked a similar question in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions462071sqlorderbyandleftouterjoindoesnthavecorrectorderhttpstackoverflow.comquestions462071sqlorderbyandleftouterjoindoesnthavecorrectordera, but this is slightly different.  I am getting data from another SQLServer 2005 database, using SSIS, and a standard data flow.  The records that I get are in a different order than in the source table actually its a view.  In the older DTS, the order doesnt change.p  pThere is no ordering on the source or destination tables or views, and normally, Id figure that if the order was important, then it would be specified.  I may have to get someone to specify an order, and we can go forward with that, but were working with historical shape files, and if the order of the attributes change, then the shapes are pointing to the wrong data.  p  pIs there a reason why the data changes order when it is imported  Is there a workaroundp  pHere is the reason the order is important.  It is for a mapping application, and the attributes and the shapes have to match.  If the order changes, then the items wont match up properly.  Unfortunately, I cant identify any order to the data, and I suspect that the previous coder assumed a consistant order, and that was all that was important.  The order, using SSIS, is not the same order, and it is never explicitly set. p

Negative 79111 pI am working on an iPhone application. When the application starts I authenticate, establish a Restful connection, get data in form of XML file, parse it and then display it in form of table view.  Here is my problem. If the user information is already stored on the application or if it is hardcoded in  the code, the application takes the authentication user name and password and proceeds to display data in table format. I was till now testing with hardcoded data. Now I want to display another view which asks for user name and password if it is not present in the application..i.e. I want to make the user name and password dynamic as opposed to static.  In my case when the use is busy inputting the user name and password, the viewDidLoad method tries to establish a connection with the server with blank user name and password  failing the server connection and the table loading. But if I run the application the second time, the application finds the user name and password entered previously and loads the tables fine.p  pIs there a way I can delay the process of server connection if the application does not find the user name and password  How can I signal the server connection method after the user has entered his user name and password p  pThanks for your help. p

To that, I say big deal.p  pConverting my app from using usercontrols to master pages is scaring me and I am afraid that my Javascript will break. p  pCommentsp

Negative 79111 pMy question is can we use dojo.xhrPost to post some Json data More detailp  pI have been experimenting with Dojo code to POST JSON data to a RESTful service. It seems to be that the behaviours of strongdojo.xhrPoststrong and strongdojo.rawXhrPoststrong are different, or to be more accurate rawXhrPost works and xhrPost does not. This is not consistent with my reading of the a hrefhttpdocs.dojocampus.orgdojorawXhrPostdocsap  blockquote   pThe original purpose of   dojo.rawXhrPost was a method that   could be used to send a raw post body   to the server. As of 1.3, this   function is common with   dojo.xhrPost. So, for usage of   dojo.rawXhrPost, see dojo.xhrPostp blockquote  pWhich implies that xhrPost is enough.

Negative 79111 pIm trying to get my sliding div working properly with strongslideTogglestrong. First off, here is the working urlp  pa hrefhttpcu3ed.comfadeslider relnofollowhttpcu3ed.comfadesliderap  pThe problem I am having with it is I am getting more of a blind effect rather than a slide down effect. Ive tried changing the CSS and using negative top margin etc. to no avail. What I am trying to accomplish is basically the same as the strongProductsstrong menu at strongtelerikdotcomstrong and the All Products menu from within the site. The one at strongaspnetajaxcontrolsexamplesdefaultstrong is more related to what I am trying to do via the click function. I realize these may be different, but what I am basically looking for functionalitywise is the div to do more of a slide in instead of a blind down. p  pThanks for any help.p  pAlso, to make an addition to this, I would like to fade in the actual contents of the panel once the panel slides in then fade out when clicking the tab to close the panel before sliding up. Ive tried adding fadeIn function to the h2 and p but no luck. If anyone wants to chime in on this as well feel free. Thank youp

Negative 79111 pThis question is probably quite different from what you are used to reading here  I hope it can provide a fun challenge.p  pEssentially I have an algorithm that uses 5or more variables to compute a single value, called codeoutcomecode.

Negative 79111 pI have a reporting page with a gridview and a calendar. When the user loads the page, the default date is today and when he clicks on a date in the calendar control, it loads the reporting data for that day. Each user has a different report and the data is between 300500 rows per day.p  pAt the moment, I have a linq query that returns the data for a day in the form of a list. Given the relatively small amount of data per query, Id like to store the result of the query in the session so that I can do the paging and sorting from the session, without going back to the data store.p  pWhat Im looking to do is a list of lists so that when the query loads, the data is saved until the session times out.

Negative 79111 pIm trying to learn how to program on android which of course uses Java. I understand Java vaugely, but this confuses me.p  pA method which I view as a function PHP being my native programming language can seemingly be declared anywhere in a java file and still be pulled out at any other point is this so What I mean is in PHP you have to define a functionmethod to then be able to call it. So everything has to be in order.p  pAlso is calling a function like including that section of code in your method calling it. Example beingp  pmethod 1 contains opendb command method 2 contains closedb command oncreate method calls method 1 then 2 does it act accordingly.p  pSorry may sound dumb but I like concrete answers and not assumptions of mine.p

Negative 79111 pIve got an iPhone app that uses 140 UIButtons PNG images, each triggering synthesised Sine tones maximum of 10 tones. The Sine tones are generated using highly optimised C code using AudioToolbox API. 10 Sine tones chews about 50 CPU at 44100hz.p  pI have presets that turn off 10 tones, and turn on 10 new different tones. This also causes the UIButtons to change state from Selected to Normal.p  pMy problem is that when 10 out of 140 UIButtons change state all at the same time it causes a glitch in the audio even though the audio only chews 50 cpu. So there is a big spike in CPU caused by changing p  pIs there a way I can handle this Can I prioritise AudioQueue over the GUI Is it because I have 140 PNG images as buttons Is it possible to create multitouch zones that are not buttons Im just looking for any advice to reduce the GUIs impact on audio processing. p

One way to execute these commands would be by creating an enormous amount of if statements, which would turn into at east one for each concept. I was wondering if there was a way to retrieve a function pointer to a function whose name is stored as string. Each concept could then contain a string that represented the function that would need to executed if the concept is present in the parse. This way the concept would already know what to do.p

Negative 79111 pThis is perhaps a question of semantics, but perhaps not, so I ask Is there an appreciable difference in the following 2 snippetsp  precodepublic Parent      Child newChild  new Child     newChild.RequestSpecialEvent  sender, e gt              newChild.DoMagic       codepre  porp  precodepublic Parent      Child newChild  new Child     newChild.RequestSpecialEvent  sender, e gt              Childsender.DoMagic       codepre  pObvious difference is option 1 sort of selfreferences itself, while option 2 performs a cast on an object. Performance wise, I expect the cast is more expensive.p  pHowever, Im theorizing that in option 1, it is technically the Parent which holds a reference to newChild through the delegate defined within Parent, so even if newChild goes away newChild  null or something similar, the newChild object cant be garbage collected gced because Parent has defined a delegate which is still attached to it. newChild can only be gced when Parent eventually goes away.p  pHowever, in option 2, Parent never creates such a hard reference to newChild, so when newChild  null happens, it truly can be gced immediately.p  pI prefer option 1 for its succinctness and readability, but worry that option 2 would be better. Thoughts Is my theory correct or offbase Is there an alternative or more preferred approach with sound reasoning for declaring the same event listener relationship with parentchild classesp  pstrongResponse to StriplingWarriorstrongp  pIn regards to the garbage collection, Im still a little skeptical. The delegate references newChild, so to me it seems newChild cant go away until the delegate goes away. Now the delegate will go away if newChild goes away...but still newChild cant go away until delegate goes away Seems circular almost. Seems like this would have to happenp  precodenewChild  null This alone wont truly free up the newChild object because the delegate still points to the newChild object.  Instead, this has to happen newChild.RequestSpecialEvent  null destroys circular reference to newChild newChild  null truly lets newChild object be gcd codepre  pOr maybe by saying newChild  null only, newChild.RequestSpecialEvent stops pointing at the delegate, which allows the delegate to go away, which then allows newChild to go away Maybe I just talked myself into your answer. p

Negative 79111 pI have a function pointer inside a codestructcode that gets dynamically set at runtime to the address of another function in various places in my code. It is defined in my header file like thisp  precode    void run codepre  pDuring compile time, I get the following warning about thisp  precode    warning function declaration isnt a prototype codepre  pThis warning is benign, because the pointer is used in many places in my code to call the function it points to, and everything works just fine. However, I would emreallyem like to silence the warning.p  pIf I change it to thisp  precode    void runvoid codepre  pI get compile errors whever I use it, because the various functions that make use of the pointer have different numbers of arguments, and saying codevoidcode inside the parenthesies tells the compiler it accepts no arguments.p  pI cant use a codevalistcode or anything fancy like that, as this is simply a pointer to another function, and I use a single pointer for them all because it keeps the code clean and simple.p  pI can silence the warning with adding this to my compiler flagsp  precode    Wnostrictprototypes codepre  pBut Id rather not have to disable compiler warnings with flags if I can avoid it.p  pSo my question is strongHow do I notate this function pointer in the code in such a way that the compiler is satisfied with the fact that it accepts any number of any kind of argumentsstrongp  pThe code works perfectly.

Negative 79111 pIm learning about MPI, but I have some doubts about its correct use. Im using MPJ Express.p  pFirst of all, I compute a acyclic directed graph whose nodes represent tasks. The incoming arcs of a node represent its inputs and the outgoing arcs its outputs. The computation of these tasks will be performed in a cluster. For now, I am running the program in my dualcore machine.p  pThis is what I didp  pI calculated the indexes each of my nodes will have as a MPI process the RANK. Then, I use Isend to send the information each node needs the task it has to perform, and the ranks of its output nodes. Now, when a process finishes its computation, it sends the values calculated to processes identified by the ranks it received at first. Each process waits for input values using Irecv.p  pIt worked well, but the whole index RANK precalculation does not seem right to me. I thought this could be a common scenario, but I havent found anything useful. p  pWhat do you think Is it right to somehow calculate the rank each process will have and tell each process the ranks of its outputs and inputs processesp  pIm doing the execution with np 10, nowp  pWhat does the 10 means if I have 2 coresp  pI think I should send each task to one of this 10 processes. What happens if I have more tasks than processes p  pIf I have less task than process, the execution goes well but the unused processes stay alive waiting for a message. How should I kill them p  pI hope I explained my doubts well. p  pThank you very much for your answers and advices.p  pEdited A little explanation about how I get the ranks each task will have as a process.p  pWhat I do is very simple and maybe silly suppose I have a list with all my nodes [v1,v2,v3] with indexes 0,1,3 respectively. p  pI know that the process with rank 0 will be the master process, which will send the task v1 to process with rank 1, v2 to process with rank 2, and so on. Now, I know that that rankv1indexv11, and the same for the rest of the nodes this was the ranks precalculation. p  pThen the master iterates over the list [v1,v2,v3] and for each node, get the ranks of its predecessors and successor based on the graph. For example, if the graph is v1v3v2, the information sent to process with rank 3 is taskv3, predecessors process with rank 1. successor process with rank 2 .p

Negative 79111 pBit of a strange one. So I had my iPhone app navigating between various screens perfectly fine and the decided to add animations between all the pages. Once added in, the animations themselves all worked fine, but as soon as I move from the home page, the view seems to shift up inside the window a small distance. After that, whichever page I move to, the view stays shifted slightly up. That is until I navigate to one of my pages which auto rotates to accommodate for videos. When on this page, the view fits the screen fine, and when I navigate off, the view flips back to portrait and the view is then perfectly fine for all of the other screens again, no shifting. All of this happened after I added the animation code for the screens but I cant see why that would have affected this at all unless I accidentally changed something else.p  pThe following is the code I have put in to use with animationsp  precodeWhatIsCTTView whatIsCTTView  [[WhatIsCTTView alloc] initWithNibNameWhatIsCTTView bundlenil] UIView currentView  self.view UIView theWindow  [currentView superview] UIView newView  whatIsCTTView.view  [currentView removeFromSuperview] [theWindow addSubviewnewView] CATransition animation  [CATransition animation] [animation setDuration0.5] [animation setTypekCATransitionPush] [animation setSubtypekCATransitionFromRight] [animation setTimingFunction[CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithNamekCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut]] [[theWindow layer] addAnimationanimation forKeySwitchToCTTView] codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated,p  pThanks,p  pMattp  pEDITp  pI found out how to fix this problem, just add the linep  pnewView.frame  CGRectMake0, 20, 320, 460p  pafter you add a new subview to the screen to make sure it is placed in the right position.

Negative 79111 pI am writing an Outlook addin that inserts content into an email, and I have a emailSent event that I would like send an event back to my server letting me know some content was shared.p  pIs there a way to attach some meta information to the email or the word doc, which is what you are creating in outlook  so that I can grab that meta info so I can send it back to my server.p  pRight now, the only way I think I can do it is to search through the email on the send event looking for my content with regex and pull out the info i need, but that seems cumbersome, and also means I need to run the regex for every email sent, even when they havent added my content.p

Negative 79111 pI have an issue with float and have included the sample code below. I am trying to create a two column layout I know how to do this a number of other ways so this question is with a view to finding out why FLOAT behaves the way it does here. p  ul liThe container DIV has two DIVs, both are floated left. li liAs expected, the size of the browser window determines whether or not the second floated block level element will go alongside or under the first floated element.li liThe problem arises with the length of the content in the second floated DIV assume the browser window is maximized, at whatever resolution. li ul  pIn the code below, I have commented out part of the second paragraph. On my browser this is the cut off mark including any content after this causes the whole DIV to clear the first DIV, even though there is a lot of space left in the second DIV before it should need to clear the first DIV.p  pI cannot see anything in the code that should cause this to happen. I am aware of how float behaves in terms of block level and inline content and the consequences of placing nonfloated blocks beside floated ones, but I cannot find anything in the documentation to explain why the block should clear when there seems to be sufficient room for its content.p  pHelp much appreciated.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN     httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivcontenttype contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt lttitlegtCSS Float Problemlttitlegt  ltstylegt  body  background5c604e   container  positionrelative backgroundyellow   p  backgroundcolorcccccc     width50   .block  width 200px height 200px   .float   float left   .pink   background ee3e64   .blue   background 44accf   ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt   ltdiv idcontainergt ltdiv classblock pink floatgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetuer Nam fringilla Vestibulum massa nisl.

Negative 79111 pWindows forms Application. VB .NET 4.0 In my application I have a global boolean variable that  keeps track of when changes are made and when they are saved called changesSaved. On closing even it checks the value of this variable before closing the window.. I am using textchanged event to automatically change the value of changesSaved to FALSE when text is changed.. Problem The group box items are being populated dynamically so the user can edit the values or simply just view them. This dynamic population is causing the textchanged event to fire because the program is changing the text value of the box to put the values in that are stored in the database. The textchanged event should not fire unless the user him or herself enters a value or values in the text boxes.. Is there a way to specify the source i guess you could say for the text changed event or another way so that it will only fire when the user inputs information. Functions are as follows The first is called by the load event to place the values in the box... The next one is the one that is being called as a result of the first one and is also the one that is causing the problems..p  precodePrivate Sub loadPropertyByVal x As Integer     Dim property As propertyinfo  db.propertyinfo.SingleFunctions s.idProperties  x     psettingsCity.Text  property.city.ToString     psettingsState.Text  property.state.ToString     psettingsPropertyName.Text  property.propertyName.ToString     psettingsZipCode.Text  property.zipcode.ToString     psettingsAddress.Text  property.address1.ToString     psettingsCity.Text  property.city.ToString     psettingsState.Text  property.state.ToString         If property.AllowRentProration  1 Then           RentProrate.Checked  True         Else           RentProrate.Checked  False         End If     RentProrate.Visible  True End Sub   Private Sub PropertyTextChangedByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles PropertyDetailsGroup.TextChanged     ChangesSaved  False End Sub    codepre

Negative 79111 pWe have a BI team that have created a wonderful data warehouse that works fine for the internal staff using it through Excel on the internal network.  They use windows authentication through the domain controller, and everything works fine, including restricting the access to users and AD Groups.p  pThe issue is that we now want to provide the same access to a wider audience that is not part of our Windows Domain.  This is further complicated by the fact that the information on the users that need access to the system is already stored in another location an application with a SQL database.p  pThe goal is to make it so that they connect probably using HTTPS to the cube using Excel Analysis services integration, and be authenticated using the UsernamePassword that they had in the main application.p  pThe main application has a WCF Service interface for user authentication, and session management, so all I really need is a way to provide authentication in front of the MSMDpump.dll against that WebService.  We can also add in a Role Mapping so that we can define the SSAS roles against the users in the application.p  pI was thinking that I could create a dll that has the same interface as the MSMDPUMP.dll, and have that translate calls between the client and the main dll, but this seems a bit of overkill.p  pAre there any prebuilt tools to do this and yes I know that Sharepoint can do something like this, but thats not an option so please dont suggest it.  Does anybody know of any blogs detailing how to do itp  pAny pointers in where to start with creating an interface between the 2p  pThe question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions126350howtosecuremsssas2005forhttpremoteaccessviainternetHow to secure MS SSAS 2005 for HTTP remote access via Interneta however, Im looking at providing the authentication mechanism from another datasource, and providing the Roles to SSAS, not the users.  We dont want to have to setup a new user in SSAS for every user that is setup in the external application.p  pUPDATE To be clear, they external users need to connect to the cube using Excel, and the data returned needs to be filtered by the role theyre in and the security applied in the Cube. We are able to cahnge the cube to use Dynamic Dimension Security and use CustomData attributes if that helps.p
Negative 79111 pOur web application runs with JBoss 7.1.1 and Java JPA2 and RichFaces4. At the moment the problem is that the application just gets stuck if the user is logged in but doesnt do anything inside the application for some time probably caused due to session timeout. Then the user has to load the web application again, which doesnt look very professional.p  pCan you give me a hint, how an automatic logout could be implemented using the mentioned technologies  p  pstrong[UPDATE]strongbr I tried a lot of possibilities but none of them work properly.

But then all the problems appear I cannot redirect from it because FacesContext is null in there. I cannot fire a hrefhttpshowcase.richfaces.orgrichfacescomponentsample.jsfdemopushampsamplepushCdiampskinblueSky relnofollowpush eventsa because I get some exceptions like NameNotFoundException or similar I tried a lot but it seemed that firing events doesnt work out of this too. Then I tried a4jpoll on ApplicationContext.isAutoLoggedOut but this doesnt work either, because if I execute poll events, the session would never expire. I always come to a dead end. If I could redirect somehow from SessionTimeoutListener, this would be the solution.p  pstrong[POSSIBLE SOLUTION]strongbr Im now satisfied with a logout which is executed when I click on any button inside the view after session is expired. This current solution is only rudimentary and not applicable for production yet, but this solution works and I will build on it I use the upper SessionTimeoutListener. Moreover I use a PhaseListener which is being invoked after the SessionTimeoutListener, so if the session expires, the SessionTimeoutListener will be invoked and destroys the session but the SessionTimeoutPhaseListener still has the FacesContext. So I can redirect there to logout pagep  precodepublic class SessionTimeoutPhaseListener implements PhaseListener      private static final long serialVersionUID  8603272654541248512L      Override     public void beforePhasePhaseEvent event              not used.

I think about some ThreadLocal context to solve that. I still have to distinguish between auto logout and manual logout. The listener is invoked in both cases. Although this solution works at the moment, the redirection in PhaseListener is also tricky, because it would be invoked over and over again by JSF which causes redirection loop errors in browser, if I wouldnt set autoLoggedOut to false.... as I said, only rudimentary, but using the PhaseListener is probably the only suitable solution.p

Negative 79111 pI expect security restrictions crosssite scripting will prevent me from doing this, but I thought asking wouldnt hurt.

It works great whether or not its embedded in all current browsers but gives me problems in IE 7. For some reason the offset jQuery gives me in IE 7 is off by the exact amount of the embedded iframe offset. I could compensate for it in this case, if I could get the offset.p  pThanks in advance.p

It is even displaying the changes I made to the XML data which means it is reading my XML data. But it doesnt work in IE.

Negative 79111 pI have looked into various ways of encrypting sqllite databases such as symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography, ciphers and hashs, but I am clueless of which would be the best to use to encrypt many sqllite databases for the flash builder  android application I am making.p  pThe process is that a client can make many databases locally specified by the company I am working for. For each of the databases I need to stop the user from accessing the databases from outside the app. Ive managed to do this using  SqlConn.openEncrypt... Therefore I encrypt the database to stop the user from accessing it.p  pAny ideas on the best way i.e. what method to use to create the key to encrypt with, the encryption key must be a byte array and equal to 16 bits in length.p  pWhen the user finalizes one of the databases, i.e. selects the database on the app, I wish for them to upload it to a server, where they can decrypt the database and manipulate the data accordingly.p  pMy question is, how can I successfully make a key within the app, transfer it once uploaded and decrypt it using php What methods would workp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 79111 pThe behavior I want to implement is to display a view at 11 scale by default. If its container is made larger by the user dynamically resizing the parent JFrame the view should be scaled to fit the larger area if made smaller, the view should be scaled to fit the smaller area  up to a limit. When smaller than a minimum size, scroll bars should appear with a viewport to support navigating around the view which is displayed at its minimum scale.p  pI have a poorlyfunctioning implementation now, using a JScrollPane and a ComponentListener to determine when a resize has occurred. Based on the new size a new scale factor is set for painting the view to fit up to the minimum scale, the preferredSize of the view is set and revalidate is called. The problem is that this results in jittery display when sizing past the points where a new scale is applied to avoid displaying scrollbars, the scrollbars appear, then disappear. I believe this is because my approach is reactive, not predictive. That is, the LayoutManager is only looking at the views preferredSize and performing layout based on that. Im listening for the resize of the JScrollPane and when it is too small only then changing the preferredSize of the view and then causing the container to be laid out again with the call to revalidate. At least thats how I understand it.p  pIve been reviewing the source for JScrollPane, JViewport and their respecive LayoutManagers. At this point Im considering subclassing one or more to have a better predictive, resulting in smoother sizing implementation. This seems like behavior that others must have implemented before. Is there another way to use existing ContainersLayoutManagersmethods to do this without subclassing and risking unintended behavior across different LnF or platformsp  pEdit Ive hacked a prototype subclass of ScrollPaneLayout. It checks for the views minimum size before adding scrollbars. This is working in that the scrollbars do not appear until the viewport is smaller than the views minimum size, instead of the original behavior which displayed scrollbars when the viewport was smaller than the views preferred size but when the scrollbars are displayed the view thinks it is still the preferred size, not the minimum size. I may have to hack at the ViewportLayout class as well, but this is quickly becoming something that I doubt will be robust.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI went back to basics and tried the suggestions again, and have been succcessful. My attempts to overload the default behavior of ScrollPaneLayout and ViewportLayout, and the interactions between them was not the right direction. After my first attempt I was convinced that there was no way to avoid the flickering and instability of my reactive approach to fixing incorrect sizing after the LayoutManagers had done their thing. Fortunately, there is a way to make this work without subclassing either LayoutManager  and as stated, its by implementing the codeScrollablecode interface which I had done correctly before, but had not made other changes to make it work. The trick is indeed to implement getScrollableTracksViewport such that it returns truefalse depending on the viewport size. What I hadnt done was update the views preferredSize in addition to the other calculuations I was doing. This was a critical step. Note that Im also relying on listening to ComponentListener.componentResized notifications to trigger the calculations needed to properly set the return values The functioning code follows, thatnks for the help.p  precodeSuppressWarningsserial class ScalingScreenPanel extends JScrollPane   private static final Dimension              PREFERREDSIZE  new Dimension800,200  private static ScalingScreen                sScreen  public ScalingScreenPanel      setPreferredSizePREFERREDSIZE     getViewport.addComponentListenernew ComponentAdapter          public void componentResizedComponentEvent event              sScreen.calculateSizesevent.getComponent.getSize                        setViewportViewsScreennew ScalingScreen         public void setShowShow pShow      sScreen.setShowpShow    class PreviewScreenPanel  SuppressWarningsserial public abstract class ScalingScreen extends JPanel implements Scrollable   private static final Dimension              PREFERREDSIZE  new Dimension1000,100 private static final JLabel                 EMPTYPANEL  new JLabelEmpty,SwingConstants.CENTER  private static final int                    DEFAULTSIZE  7 private static final int                    MINIMUMSIZE  5 private static final int                    SPACING  3 private static final int                    MINIMUMPITCH  MINIMUMSIZESPACING  Do not modify directly private static final int                    DEFAULTPITCH  DEFAULTSIZESPACING  Do not modify directly  protected int                               cSize protected int                               cPitch protected Dimension                         cOrigin private Dimension                           cMinimumScreenSize private Dimension                           cDefaultScreenSize  protected Dimension                         cCurrentScreenSize private boolean                             cEnableVerticalScrollbar  false, cEnableHorizontalScrollbar  false  protected Dimension                         cGridSize  null  ScalingScreen      cOrigin  new Dimension0,0     addEMPTYPANEL  public void setShowShow pShow      removeEMPTYPANEL     cGridSize  new DimensionpShow.dimension     cMinimumScreenSize  new DimensioncGridSize.widthMINIMUMPITCHSPACING,cGridSize.heightMINIMUMPITCHSPACING     cDefaultScreenSize  new DimensioncGridSize.widthDEFAULTPITCHSPACING,cGridSize.heightDEFAULTPITCHSPACING     setMinimumSizecMinimumScreenSize     setPreferredSizecDefaultScreenSize     calculateSizesgetSize                 repaint  public void calculateSizesDimension pViewportSize      if cGridSizenull return     cPitch  Math.maxMINIMUMPITCH,Math.minpViewportSize.widthSPACINGcGridSize.width,pViewportSize.heightSPACINGcGridSize.height     cSize  cPitch  SPACING     cOrigin  new DimensionpViewportSize.widthcPitchcGridSize.width2,pViewportSize.heightcPitchcGridSize.height2     cCurrentScreenSize  new DimensionMath.maxpViewportSize.width,cMinimumScreenSize.width,Math.maxpViewportSize.height,cMinimumScreenSize.height     Dimension preferredSize  new Dimension     if pViewportSize.widthltcMinimumScreenSize.width          cOrigin.width  0         cEnableHorizontalScrollbar  true         preferredSize.width  cMinimumScreenSize.width      else          cOrigin.width  pViewportSize.widthcPitchcGridSize.width2         cEnableHorizontalScrollbar  false         preferredSize.width  cDefaultScreenSize.width                   if pViewportSize.heightltcMinimumScreenSize.height          cOrigin.height  0         cEnableVerticalScrollbar  true         preferredSize.height  cMinimumScreenSize.height      else          cOrigin.height  pViewportSize.heightcPitchcGridSize.height2         cEnableVerticalScrollbar  false         preferredSize.height  cDefaultScreenSize.height          setPreferredSizepreferredSize                 repaint    Methods to implement abstract Scrollable interface Override public Dimension getPreferredScrollableViewportSize      return getPreferredSize  Override public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportHeight      return cEnableVerticalScrollbar  Override public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportWidth      return cEnableHorizontalScrollbar  Override public int getScrollableBlockIncrementRectangle pVisibleRect, int pOrientation, int pDirection      switch pOrientation      case SwingConstants.VERTICAL         return pVisibleRect.height2     case SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL         return pVisibleRect.width2     default         return 0              Override public int getScrollableUnitIncrementRectangle pVisibleRect,         int pOrientation, int pDirection      switch pOrientation      case SwingConstants.VERTICAL         return 1     case SwingConstants.HORIZONTAL         return 1     default         return 0             Override       public void paintComponentGraphcs g             custom drawing stuff          class ScalingScreen codepre

Negative 79111 pIn a comment on the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12866291arenewtypesfasterthanenumerations titletestprevious questiona, I claimedp  blockquote   pI have another benchmark to indicate ghc7.4.1llvm does unpacking of enumerations on strict data fields.p blockquote  pIn fact, after some experimentation, I believe that, in at least some simplistic cases, using an enumeration is at least as fast as, and actually might be more memory efficient hence faster in a more realistic application than using a newtype of Word8 or Int, even when used in a strict field of a datatype. As I said in the previous question, I have experienced the similar phenomenon in a more realistic but still small setting. p  pCan anyone point me to some relevant references as to what optimizations ghcllvm does for enumerations In particular, does it really unpack the internal tag of the enumeration on a strict data field The assembly output and the result of profiling seem to suggest that that is the case, but to me there is no indication on the core level. Any insights will be greatly appreciated.p  pOne more question Are enumerations emalwaysem at least as efficient as newtypes of the corresponding Integral, where using them makes sense Note that enumerations can behave like Integrals,too. If not, what is the hopefully realistically useful exception Daniel Fischer suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12866291arenewtypesfasterthanenumerations titletesthis answera that putting an enumeration on a strict field of a multipleconstructor datatype might prevent certain optimizations. However I have failed to verify this in the twoconstructor case. Maybe there is a difference when putting them in a large multipleconstructor datatypes p  pIm also curious about what exactly is happening in the following benchmark. In all the four cases, roughly the same amount of bytes were allocated in the heap. However, for enumerations, the GC actually did less copying and the maximum residencies were smaller compared to newtypes.p  pActually my real question was, emis it worthwhile to to try and convert enumerations to newtypes when performance mattersem , but I assumed that being a bit more specific might be more helpful.p  pA possible implication of this question would be this If you are using a large number of Ints in your program which actually varies on some very small subset, then changing them to an enumeration rather than to an unboxed type might be a performance gain but careful for strictness.p  pHere is the summary of the benchmark, followed by the benchmark code and the convenience makefile for testing on your system.p  pre benchmarking d mean 11.09113 ns, lb 11.06140 ns, ub

Negative 79111 pI have installed the Windows version of Red5 RC2 and am running the server. I have, unfortunately, noticed  some interesting problems with the distributionp  ol lipThe windows install version of this release candidate does not have the demo applications. The entire demos folder is not included. There is a link to it on the main Red5 app page, but the link goes nowhere. I actually had to download a zip file with a previous version of Red5 in order to acquire the demos  folder. If someone at Red5 is reading this, could you please correct this oversightpli lipThere is some weird port handling behavior when you run the server. When running the server, I get several JVMBind errors  until I make changes to the ports in the red5.properties file. I have to change the http.port entry and the jmx.rmi.port entry. Only by changing these ports do I seem to get the server to run properly. What is really strange, though, is that I am running the server on a laptop which I periodically shut down. If I boot the laptop and run Red5 again, I get the JVMBind errors again This despite the fact that I am pointing it to different ports. I have found that I can then change back to the old port numbers and Red5 starts up without problems. So now on jmx.rmi.port I alternate between port 4444 and 9999. On http.port I alternate between Port 8080 and 8081. In any event, there appears to be something in the server that somehow thinks that a previously used port is still in use. Some kind of cache If so, is there any way to clear it so that I wont have to change ports all the timepli lipOnce I get the server running with the proper demos folder in place, the demos seem to work well  as long as I am running everything on the same machine. For some reason, however, the server does not  respond to http requests from other machines. This is clearly some kind of configuration issue, but the documentation that I have read so far dos not tell how to make Red5 handle requests from anywhere other than localhost. I would like to run the demo apps on the same machine and other machines. Is there any documentation on how to make this so Could someone tell me where that documentation ispli ol  pThese are the things I have seen so far with Red5. It looks like it has a lot of potential, but it  looks like there are some real bugs in the server. Is this correct or is there some kind of setup or  configuration that will make these problems go awayp  precodeSomeone please advise. codepre

Negative 79111 pOK, this is the question p  ul liWe all know codeObject Librarycode, with all the controls in itli liHow could I add a custom object into that list e.g. Under Custom Objectsli ul  pIve read the following, but I still cant get it to work Xcode 4.2 on Snow Leopard p  blockquote   pstrongAdding Custom Objects to the Librarystrongp      pAlthough you normally drag items out of the Library window and into   your user interface, you can also drag your custom configurations of   those objects back into the Library window. Doing this lets you   retrieve those custom objects later without having to reconfigure   them.p      pTo add a custom object to the library, do the followingp      ol   lipIn your window, configure the object as you would like it.pli   lipPress and hold the Option key and drag the object to the Library window.pli   lipIn the organization pane of the Library window, drop the object on the Custom Objects group or on a custom group you created. Interface   Builder prompts you for information about the dropped object.pli   lipFill in the information about your object and press OK.pli   ol      pYou can use this technique to drag one object or a group of objects.   When dragging more than one object, the entire group becomes a single   item in the Library window. Dragging that item back out of the library   creates all of the original objects.p      pThe items you add to the library persist between Interface Builder   sessions so that you can use them over and over again. To remove a   custom item from the Library window, do the followingp      ol   lipSelect the Custom Objects group in the library to see the items in that group.pli   lipSelect your custom item.pli   lipPress the Delete key.pli   ol      pYou must remove custom items from the Custom Objects group in order to   remove them from the Library window. Removing items from your custom   group folders removes them from the group but not the library.p      pIn addition to adding custom configurations of objects to the library,   you can also add entirely new objects to the library through an   Interface Builder plugin. Plugins are typically used in situations   where you want to be able to configure and edit the attributes of your   custom classes.

Negative 79111 pI have about 50 different static libraries being linked into my c project and the linking takes on average 70s. p  pIve found that moving around with the link order of the libraries changes this time. This is expected I guess if the linker doesnt have to keep searching for a set of symbols throughout the entire symbol table it has built upto that point. p  pI suppose I could use nm to get a dependency graph between the static libraries. However, that would only give me one correct link order. What would be the factors involved in obtaining the fastest link orderp  pI get the feeling that it would have something to do with the abovementioned dependency graph by getting a traversal that would try to minimize some quantity but Im really not sure which. p  pAny help would be appreciated. p  pI am primarily using the intel compiler and also the gcc compiler every now and then. Both of them seem to be using the GNU ld linker when I check it with top. Hope this helps... p  pSo just to clarify a bit more on what Im trying to ask, I already know how to get a 1pass ordering from a set of static libraries. Id written this script myself but as Olafs answer below suggests, there are wellknown tools for doing this. p  pMy question is, I already have two 1pass link orderings one of which runs in 85s and the other one runs in 70s. So clearly, there is still some more optimization that we can do within 1pass orders. p

Negative 79111 pI have a lot to learn in the way of OO patterns and this is a problem Ive come across over the years. I end up in situations where my classes sole purpose is procedural, just basically wrapping a procedure up in a class. It doesnt seem like the right OO way to do things, and I wonder if someone is experienced with this problem enough to help me consider it in a different way. My specific example in the current application follows.p  pIn my application Im taking a set of points from engineering survey equipment and normalizing them to be used elsewhere in the program. By normalize I mean a set of transformations of the full data set until a destination orientation is reached.p  pEach transformation procedure will take the input of an array of points i.e. of the form codeclass point  float x float y float z code and return an array of the same length but with different values. For example, a transformation like codepoint[] RotateXYpoint[] inList, float anglecode. The other kind of procedure wold be of the analysis type, used to supplement the normalization process and decide what transformation to do next. This type of procedure takes in the same points as a parameter but returns a different kind of dataset.p  pMy question is, what is a good pattern to use in this situation The one I was about to code in was a Normalization class which inherits class types of RotationXY for instance. But RotationXYs sole purpose is to rotate the points, so it would basically be implementing a single function. This doesnt seem very nice, though, for the reasons I mentioned in the first paragraph.p  pThanks in advancep

This a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5775064mclapplywithbigobjectsserializationistoolargetostoreinarawvectorposta seems on point, but the vectors I am passing back and forth 50K shouldnt come close to triggering this error. Moreover, I can get things to partially work by dividing my data into smaller pieces. I think the problem must be some kind of memory leak associated with Rmpi, but I have none of the tools necessary for debugging such a thing. Hopefully you can at least point me in the direction of the tools for debugging what is going on here.p  pThe data I am working with have 2.5 million records, each record has 40 columns. I submit a 50K x 40 data frame to parApply and it returns a 50K numeric vector.p  precodeIn an effort to avoid the serialization error I break into smaller pieces to avoid     problems with large vectors getting transferred between master and slave nodes numBreaksltfloorlengthdata[,1]50000 baseltminlengthdata[,1],50000  test data sets are lt 50K and shouldnt                                     crash the function    piece.inltdata[c1base,]         this is the first batch of records I submit  statusltmpi.parApplypiece.in,1,test returns a vector of length 50K statusltapplypiece.in,1,test   commented out, function runs fine locally using                                                    standard apply function cl lt makeSOCKclusterclocalhost,localhost,localhost,localhost,localhost statusltparApplycl,piece.in,1,test commented out, function runs fine locally                                       using snows SOCK cluster and identical                                       parApply function ifnumBreaksgt1 for i in 2numBreaks   piece.inltdata[cbase1base50000,]   piece.outltmpi.parApplypiece.in,1,test  returns a vector of length 50K   piece.outltapplypiece.in,1,test  piece.outltparApplycl,piece.in,1,test   statusltappendstatus,piece.out          add to existing vector   baseltbase50000                          increment base   printpasteclusters assigned to records,base,through,base50000     This piece cleans up the residual records  iflengthcbaselengthdata[,1]gt1 amp base lt lengthdata[,1]   piece.inltdata[cbase1lengthdata[,1],]   piece.outltapplypiece.in,1,test   piece.outltmpi.parApplypiece.in,1,test   piece.outltparApplycl,piece.in,1,test   statusltappendstatus,piece.out   printpasteFinal status has length,lengthstatus   codepre  pThis function works as intended on test datasets 100K records. It works locally using snow or the standard apply function though it takes a day. It failed with the serialization too large... error before I broke it into smaller pieces. It failed with the same error when I made the pieces 100K records long. It runs successfully as documented by print statements written to file all the way up to the iteration covering records 1.3 million to 1.35 million with the records being submitted in batches of 50K and then fails with the serialization error.p  pI know there are other ways of doing parallel processing, and the foreach command is something I wish I was using here but I am constrained by not knowing anything about the computing environment in which the parallel nodes are created so I would like to stay with Rmpi if I can. Any tips as to how to debug thisp  pMuch obliged.p  pChrisp

Negative 79111 pIm trying out using VirtualBox and Android x86 as a faster alternative to the emulator that comes with the Android SDK, which is so laggy as to be unusable on my 2GHz quad core Mac with 16GB ram.p  pThis tutorial got me up and running and it seems pretty snappy a hrefhttpwww.bobbychanblog.com201107fasterandroidemulatoralternativeusingvirtualbox relnofollowhttpwww.bobbychanblog.com201107fasterandroidemulatoralternativeusingvirtualboxap  pSetting it up is not for the faint of heart but overall looks like a good option.

Negative 79111 pIn my xcode app, I previously had things set up like thisp  pmain display  table of episodes view  episode detail viewp  pWhen the user selected an episode in the UITableView, the detail view was loaded. The detail view then gave some new functions, such as downloading the corresponding file. This download was handled through a helper class I made and initiated when the user hit a button on the detail view.That all worked fine. p  pBut because there really wasnt too much new information in the detail view, I started trying to bring it all into the cell on the table view. Now when a user clicks a cell, the cell height expands and displays the extra information.p  pSo my question is this. How do I handle the methods I used to call from the detail view, like to download the filep  pFor example, the function I strongwasstrong using to download the associated filep  precode IBActiondownloadTheFileidsender      self.downloadProgress.hidden  false     self.downloadButton.hiddentrue      [self.myEpisodeDownloader getFileFromURL[self.currentEpisode epFileURL] withIndicator[self downloadProgress]]   codepre  pWhen I try to bring that over into the new method, I get confused about what to pass to it and how it accesses different things. strongBasically, in losing the detail view I have lost a container for everything.strong You can see in my function I use self to get and modify different things. Now instead of a container I have instances of cellForRowAtIndexPath trying to do things.p  pI started down the path of passing everything to the download function, but it started to smell wrong. Should I try delegates An intermediary class Give up and go back to the old wayp

Negative 79111 pI recently ran into a problem in our SQL Server 2008 Analysis Services Cube. Imagine you have a simple sales data warehouse with orders and products. Each order can be associated with several products, and each product can be contained in several orders. So the data warehouse consists out of at least 3 tables One for the Products, one for the Orders and one for the reference table, modelling the nn relationship between both. The question I want our cube to answer is How many orders are there which contain both product x and product y In SQL, this is easyp  precodeselect orderid from dbo.OrderRefProduct where ProductID  1 intersect select orderid from dbo.OrderRefProduct where ProductID  3 codepre  pSince I am fairly proficient in SQL, but a newbie in MDX, I have been unable to implement that in MDX. I have tried using distinct count measures, the MDXfunctions codeintersectcode and codenonemptycode and subcubes. I also tried duplicating the dimensions logically by adding the dimension to the cube twice as well as physically by duplicating the data source table and the dimension.p  pOn a hrefhttpwww.zeitz.netthtsintersection.zip relnofollowhttpwww.zeitz.netthtsintersection.zipa, you can download a zip file of 25kB size which contains an SQL script with some test data and the Analysis Services Solution using the tables.p  pWe are using SQL Server 2008 R2 and its Analysis Services counterpart. Performance considerations are not that important, as the data volume is rather low millions of rows compared to the other measure groups included in that cube billions of rows.p  pThe ultimate goal would be to be able to use the desired functionality in standard OLAP custom calculated measures are ok, since Excel is our primary frontend, and our customers would like to choose their Products from the dimension list and get the correct result in the cube measures. But even a working standalone MDXQuery would greatly help.p  pThank youp  pstrongEdit March 12thstrong Did I miss something or cant this be solved somehowp  pIf it helps to build the mdx, here is another way to get the results in sql, using subquerys.

Its all pretty straightforward and I have streaming notifications set up with the exchange server. However, Ive hit a couple of snags that are a bit headscratching.p  pFirst, it seems that every event or batch of events gets sent twice. For example, if Im watching the Calendar for Modified events and I create a new appointment or modify an appointment, Ill get two identical notifications, each with an ItemEvent and a FolderEvent. Theyre definitely distinct objects coming in one right after the other and there is zero difference between the two events. Each object has the same value in any relevant field as the previous. The only difference seems to be the memory address.p  pSecond, Im hoping to make the notifications a bit more finegrained. I want to see when a calendar item has been modified, but not when a calendar item is created. It appears that I can only watch the Calendar folder overall and that Modified includes new items. Is there any way to make that more precisep  pEDIT Actually, I found that this only seems to happen with Meetings created in the Calendar folder, and only those with other Attendees. Two NotificationEventArgs, each with a FolderEvent and an ItemEvent. On further inspection, I recently found that one ItemEvent is Created and one is Modified, which isnt terribly surprising to me now knowing how Exchange tends to handle Appointments. The idea was to watch for both created and modified items, although I suppose it could have been broken up into two streaming subscriptions or, given the behavior, set to only modified as that would have captured new Appointments anyway.p  pIn any case, this was handled with a periodic SyncFolder Much was changed between the asking of this and the final design, which worked out well in the end.p

Negative 79111 pI have a Windows 7 driver where I want to synchronize access to a variable. Can I use InterlockedExchange for itp  pMy current understanding of InterlockedExchange is, that InterlockedExchange is done via compiler intrinsics.

And process them and this is done in a infinite loop and only stops when application is stopped manually. p  pThe issue im facing here is that the application stops fetching records from database when I get Read Time out error. And I guess this is because of the network fluctuations. p  pThe code for reading from the db is written in try catch block.so when the error occurs it gets logged but also stops.

Negative 79111 pI have built a stored procedure that builds a memory temporary table codeAcode and then fills this with data by looping through the results of a standard cursor. Data is selected into the temporary table via several joins from other MyISAM tables that I have in my database. The SP works correctly, but it was running up against a full table memory limit. To solve this I cranked the memory limit upp  precodeset tmptablesize127108864 121MEGs set maxheaptablesize127108864 121MEGs codepre  pThis is about what is took to get my SP to run successfully. This seems odd to me because the table codeAcode that is created and returned via a select  from A is only 16MEGs in size. Im not sure what is causing the other part of the memory requirement, which is about 100MEGs. It seems like the SP is using way more memory than needed. My guess is that the joins that are run in the SP as part of the cursor loop are leaving their temp tables behind after they run and that these are not being cleaned up until after the SP finishes execution. This would mean that a huge stack of joined temp tables is floating in memory. Is there any way to stop this or to verify that the extra memory is being sucked up by these joins run inside the SP cursor loop Could this memory suck be coming from something else Thank you to anyone who helps.p

Negative 79111 pIt seems clear from several posts I read on this forum that the Android SDK  does not yet support dualsim phones natively and that its up to the phone vendor to implement such support. I am using a Sony Experia M running Android 4.2.2 Build 152.A.1.12 to develop a sms app. I was previously able to run this app successfully on a Nexus 4.  On the Experia however, the behavior is a little puzzling. SMSManager seems to always picks SIM 1 to send messages out. The default sms app on Experia gives a choice to the user to pick which SIM to use while sending messages. p  pI was wondering how to implement similar functionality in my app. Does Android natively enumerate the SIMs on the phone and if not has anyone been able to use the Sony SDK extensions to do this p

Negative 79111 pI am trying to understand exactly how requests to a rails application get processed with Phusion Passenger.  I have read through the Passenger docs found here a hrefhttpwww.modrails.comdocumentationArchitectural20overview.htmlphusionpassengerarchitecture relnofollowhttpwww.modrails.comdocumentationArchitectural20overview.htmlphusionpassengerarchitecturea and I understand how they maintain copies of the rails framework and your application code in memory so that every request to the application doesnt get bogged down by spinning up another instance of your application.  What I dont understand is how these separate application instances share the native ruby process on my linux machine.  I have been doing some research and here is what I think is happening  p  pOne request hits the web server which dispatches Passenger to fulfill the request on one of Passengers idle worker processes.  Another request comes in almost simultaneously and is handled by yet another idle Passenger worker process.  p  pAt this point there are two requests being executed which are being managed by two different Passenger worker processes.  Passenger creates a green thread on Linuxs native Ruby thread for each worker process.

Negative 79111 pI am investigating the system tables within the SYS Schema in Apache Derby. I have a database that uses the Apache Derby RDBMS and I have added three tables to it called Accounts, Customers and Employees. The database runs behind a Java application that runs queries against these three tables to perform any one of the CRUD functions these queries work fine so no issue therep  pWhat I want to do is to get meta data about the tables I created through the system tables in the database the table names, column names, data in the tables etc using SQL not Javas classes, which I do know about rather than simply querying the actual tables themselves. Ive looked at the reference to the tables on the a hrefhttpdb.apache.orgderbydocs10.3refrrefsistabs38369.html relnofollowDerby system tablesa page and I think that the tables that I should be focusing on are SYSCOLUMNS and SYSTABLES. Whats odd is that SYSTABLES shows information about my tables but SYSCOLUMNS does not.p  pThere are other tables in the SYS schema that contain data about my tables, such as SYSCONTSTRAINTS, SYSFOREIGNKEYS, SYSKEYS and  as mentioned above SYSTABLES. So to me its somewhat peculiar that SYSCOLUMNS doesnt also have information about my tables inside them.p  pWhen I actually run a query against SYSCOLUMNS I get this errorp  precodeError code 20000, SQL state XN020 Error marshalling or unmarshalling a user defined type org.apache.derby.catalog.types.TypeDescriptorImpl codepre  pI think this refers to the COLUMNDATATYPE column based on reading the reference of the SYSCOLUMNS table in the link above but I have looked at other pages and dont really understand it.p  pIf it helps here are the columns and data types for my tablesp  pstrongCUSTOMERSstrongp  pCUSTOMERID Integer Primary Key Autoincrement starts at 1, increments by 1p  pFULLNAME Varchar 50p  pstrongACCOUNTSstrongp  pACCOUNTID Integer Primary Key Autoincrement starts at 1, increments by 1p  pCUSTOMER ID Integer foreign key references CUSTOMERID in CUSTOMERp  pACCOUNTTYPE Varchar 50p  pBALANCE Doublep  pCREDITLIMIT Doublep  pstrongEMPLOYEESstrongp  pEMPLOYEEID Integer Primary Key Autoincrement starts at 1, increments by 1p  pFULLNAME Varchar 50p  pUSERNAME Varchar 50p  pPASSWORD Varchar 50p  pApologies but I cant post any screenshots due to reputation rules Im signed in on my Google account.

Negative 79111 pI have a very simple application, but it is giving a problem.

Negative 79111 pIve been reading a lot about Entity Frameworks and now I want to implement it on my game. An Entity Framework is based on making the game entities simple containers of Components, where a Component contains a certain characteristic of an Entity and all the variablesaccessors which describe this characteristic. The game logic is then modularized by creating Systems. Each System implements and runs a certain aspect of the game logic eg. Collisions, Rendering, Animation. Each System has to be able to access every Entity which has some certain combination of Components eg. RenderSystem has to get strongonlystrong Entities which have PositionComponent and AnimationComponent. p  pMy question regards the best data structure for achieving such functionality. p  pMy current idea is to create a Vector with N cells, where N is the number of possible components of List of Entity. So whenever I create instantiate and add certain Components an Entity, I would also reference this Entity from each List for each Component it contains. Killing an Entity would require removing each reference from each List. The problem would be querying which entities have to be processed by a certain System, because the searchkey would be a strongcombinationstrong of Components, and not a single Component, adding overhead to the operation many searches and comparisons would have to be done.p  pIs my idea good Is there any better data structure I can use Note that everything in the game is supposed to be an Entity, summing up to thousands of Entites on a single Level I could possibly use some space partitioning.p

Also, the buChannels array needs to be stored for each busUnit.p  pBecause Angular parent controllers cant read child properties, the normal solution would be to create a property in the parent and reference it in the child. But, since the property Id want to reference is dependent on an entity thats only fetched in the child, this cant be done.p  pOr can it Any ideas or other recommended approaches.

Negative 79111 pIm parsing a table that contains dates in a few different formats. Ive identified at least five potential date formats I need to handle. So my current setup for the easy four formats is basically something like the followingp  precodeCultureInfo cultureInfo  new CultureInfoenUS string[] dateFormats   MMyyyy, Myyyy, yyyyMM, yyyyM  if DateTime.TryParseExactsomeDateString, dateFormats, cultureInfo,                             DateTimeStyles.AllowWhiteSpaces, out someDate      throw new someExceptionUnable to parse date  codepre  pThis works great. However, for the fifth format, Im not sure what to do. The format is basically codeYYYY.MM12code. For example, if code2014.25code is provided, then it should be interpreted as codeApril 1, 2014code.p  pIve searched through the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaz4se3k128vvs.11029.aspx relnofollow titleMSDNstandardcustom date format specifiers on MSDNa but I dont see any reference to adding custom date formats outside of the standard specifiers of which, a year fraction doesnt seem to be an option.p  pIs there a builtin way to add this kind of format, or do I have to write my own parser Im trying to avoid splitting it into another parser just to keep fairly standardized. Thankfully, it doesnt look like I will ever have to handle codeYYYY.MMcode, so at least I should be able check for this date format by using codesomeDateString.Contains.code.p

Negative 79111 pOk,  I have tried using ctrl f12, ctrl f11, 7, and 9.  They all do the exact same thing.  They rotate the screen and then I wait 30 minutes and the content on the avd does not rotate with the avd.  It is like I have it locked,  but as you can see that is not the issue in my code.  This is to a very basic code that just has text on the screen.

Negative 79111 pI am totally stumped by this issue and I do not know what to do. I have created a simple C Windows Form application using Visual Studio 2012 Premium.  I have a small program that starts up and creates a NotifyIcon in the system tray.  On click of the tray icon, a context menu is displayed and it shows a few menu options Options, About, etc., where each option displays a form.  I have added two icon files .ico via the Resources by right clicking on my Project item, Properties, Resources.  I programmatically change the Icon of my NotifyIcon, alternating between the two different icons.  My problem is that my old icons keep displaying, instead of my new ones that Ive added to the project.  To be clear, my issue is that OLD icons keep displayingeverything is working and there are no errors, it just doesnt show my latest icons. The way Im changing the icons in code is usingp  precodenotifyIcon.Icon  Resources.IconA03312014 or the other one the numbers are the date codepre  pI initially made my icons and used those and later decided to change them a little bitI changed some colors, etc.  So then I removed the old icons from my project by clicking the Exclude from Project option.  Then I added my new icons, which had different names.  Then I updated my two code references that load the icons to use the new names.  No matter what I do, my newupdated icons are not displayedp  pWhether I run the program in Visual Studio in Debug or Release mode, it does not matter.  I can clean the solution, rebuild, and then run the executable directly by clicking on it in Windows, and no difference.  Old icons are shown. I have followed different sets of instructions online that explain how to clear the Windows 8 icon cache three different methods.  I have cleared the cached Notification tray icons as well, using two different methods.p  pBasically, I cleaned my solution and then closed Visual Studio.  I kill all explorer processes, run ie4uinit.exe ClearIconCache from the command line and delete the IconCache.db file.  Then I delete the notification icon cache by editing the registry following instructions similar to these a hrefhttpwww.sevenforums.comtutorials13102notificationareaiconsreset.html relnofollowhttpwww.sevenforums.comtutorials13102notificationareaiconsreset.htmla.  Then I shutdown the computer.  Upon starting backup and rebuilding my solution and running, the old icons are still there somehow.  The physical .ico files for the old icons were deleted long ago.  Each time Ive added new icons to my Resources, Ive created new icon files from scratch using icobundl.exe and named them uniquely by including the date in the name.  I am aware that Windows, and apparently Visual Studio also, like to cache icons and if you delete some icon file A.ico in Windows and then rename another icon file B.ico to A.ico, the B.ico files actual icon will change to As.  Anyway, I dont the name of the icon file is the issue.p  pNow, in code, if I use the same strategy and set one of my forms icons, it works correctly and the form displays my latest icon, while my notify icon still shows the old and now nonexistent, except in Visual Studio la la land icon. So, I havep  precode... iffirstState     notifyIcon.Icon  Resources.IconA03312014     optionsForm.Icon  Resources.IconA03312014  else     notifyIcon.Icon  Resources.IconB03312014     optionsForm.Icon  Resources.IconB03312014  firstState  firstState ... codepre  pThere are no errors and both the notifyIcon and optionsForms changes, but the notify icon displays my OLD icon that no longer exists anywhere except somewheresomehow in VS.  The forms icon changes to my updatedlatest icon.p  pIf I copy my apps .exe file to another computer and run it, it too displays the old icons for the notify icon, so the old icons are somehow still embedded in my exe generated by Visual Studio.  If I just directly load the .ico file, instead of referencing my project resources, the new icons ARE shown.  This have to be some sort of strange Resources caching issue in Visual Studiop  pCan anyone please help me with this issue  I just dont understand how my old icons are still existing somewhere, and how Visual Studio somehow knows how to switch them  Thats right, the above icon swapout works perfectly for the form.  But for the notifyIcon, the icon does switch from A to B, but it uses the old A icon and the old B iconicons that do not exist anywhere anymorep  pI hope I have explained my issue.  I greatly appreciate any help that anyone can provide.p

Negative 79111 pI have a script that uses ajax to send mail. I have tested it by checking the email that will receive the mail and true enough, the ajax request is successful. I also checked the console window of my Firefox browser and it also shows me a successful message. But my problem here is that instead of the codedonecode callback function, the codeerrorcode callback function is fired. You may all wonder why Im still using the codeerrorcode function instead of codefailcode. The reason for this is because when I tried using the codefailcode function, it doesnt trigger the alertbox that I have set inside it. So what I did is go back and use codeerrorcode function again since at least it triggers the alertbox I made.p  pHere is the scriptp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var submitButton  submit               Variable to cache button element     var alertBox1  .success                  Variable to cache meter element     var alertBox2  .alert     var closeButton1  .close1                   Variable to cache close button element     var closeButton2  .close2                   Variable to cache close button element       function          contactform .submit functione             e.preventDefault             console.log hello              var formData   this .serialize             console.log formData               .ajax                  type POST,                  url send.php,                  data formData,                  dataType json,                  done function                          submitButton.fadeOut500  Fades out submit button when its clicked                         setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                              alertBox1.fadeIn500  Fades in success alert                         , 500                  ,                  error function                     submitButton.fadeOut500  Fades out submit button when its clicked                         setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                              alertBox2.fadeIn500  Fades in fail alert                         , 500                                                  closeButton1.clickfunction   Initiates the reset function             alertBox1.fadeOut500  Fades out success message             setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                 input, textarea.notinput[typesubmit].val  Resets the input fields                 submitButton.fadeIn500  Fades back in the submit button             , 500                  return false  This stops the success alert from being removed as we just want to hide it                   closeButton2.clickfunction   Initiates the reset function             alertBox2.fadeOut500  Fades out success message             setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                 input, textarea.notinput[typesubmit].val  Resets the input fields                 submitButton.fadeIn500  Fades back in the submit button             , 500                  return false  This stops the fail alert from being removed as we just want to hide it               ltscriptgt codepre  pWhat seems to be the one causing this Just to reiterate, Ive tried using codefailcode instead of codeerrorcode callback function since that is one of the answers I found in the Internet and also because I know for a fact that the codeerrorcode function is already deprecated.

Negative 79111 pMy dll uses SetWindowsHookEx to get into the main windows thread  3rd party application  to subclass it with SetWindowSubclass. Subclassed window procedure is used just to control additional child window added to the main window. RemoveWindowSubclass is called inside window procedure on WMDESTROY. When the hooked window is closed by user, application unloads dll. After DLLPROCESSDETACH is processed, sometimes  on some pcs  application is crashed. All threads which dll created are finished before DLLPROCESSDETACH, so it does not look like some not finished cleanup.

Negative 79111 pOk, I have to use Flex 3 because I am using this in an Adobe Connect pod. I have a List component, which is capable of being reordered through drag and drop. If someone leaves the browser and comes back into the meeting room, I am trying to redisplay how they had items ordered from their drag and drop. So I need a way to reorder the list. I was looking into sort for Arrays on the dataProvider. But I have not been able to figure out the proper event to sort the list once, all of the items have the appropriate data in. p  pIn any case, does anyone know how to tell the data of an itemRenderer to have ordered values, and then tell the list to reorder the items in the list according to the new valuesp

Negative 79111 pEDIT Ive made the main change of using iterators to keep track of successive positions in the bit and character strings and pass the latter by const ref. Now, when I copy the sample inputs onto themselves multiple times to test the clock, everything finishes within 10 seconds for really long bit and character strings and even up to 50 lines of sample input. But, still when I submit, CodeEval says the process was aborted after 10 seconds. As I mention, they dont share their input so now that extensions of the sample input work, Im not sure how to proceed. Any thoughts on an additional improvement to increase my recursive performance would be greatly appreciated.p  pNOTE Memoization was a good suggestion but I could not figure out how to implement it in this case since Im not sure how to store the bittochar correlation in a static lookup table. The only thing I thought of was to convert the bit values to their corresponding integer but that risks integer overflow for long bit strings and seems like it would take too long to compute. Further suggestions for memoization here would be greatly appreciated as well.p  pThis is actually one of the moderate CodeEval challenges. They dont share the sample input or output for moderate challenges but the output fail error simply says aborted after 10 seconds, so my code is getting hung up somewhere.p  pThe assignment is simple enough. You take a filepath as the single commandline argument. Each line of the file will contain a sequence of 0s and 1s and a sequence of As and Bs, separated by a white space. You are to determine whether the binary sequence can be transformed into the letter sequence according to the following two rulesp  p1 Each 0 can be converted to any nonempty sequence of As e.g, A, AA, AAA, etc.p  p2 Each 1 can be converted to any nonempty sequences of As OR Bs e.g., A, AA, etc., or B, BB, etc but not a mixture of the lettersp  pThe constraints are to process up to 50 lines from the file and that the length of the binary sequence is in [1,150] and that of the letter sequence is in [1,1000].p  pThe most obvious starting algorithm is to do this recursively. What I came up with was for each bit, collapse the entire next allowed group of characters first, test the shortened bit and character strings. If it fails, add back one character from the killed character group at a time and call again.p  pHere is my complete code.

Negative 79111 pEverybody who works with multithreaded environments knows you must synchronize between threads to avoid race cases.  Im particularly interested in synchronization that occurs within a sharedptr deleter.p  pIn my real situation, I have multiple classes interacting in a way that some of them are aware synchronization is going on, and others are not.

However, this seems very inconsiderate.  It seems like thread 1 is expected to know all synchronization that happened to the object before it can have the privilege of calling a destructor which could be brutal if the destructor is called during stack unwinding.p  pAm I missing something   I know every implementation of sharedptr actually DOES do synchronization for this very reason, but I cant find anything in the spec to suggest I can trust it.p  pIs there anything in the spec to suggest that synchronization will occur before a deleter gets calledp

Inside those methods I am using instance of a synchronous SQL connection.p  pWhen I changed my methods from codevoidcode to codeasync Taskcode and calling them with codeawaitcode I dont know if those methods finished, and when.p  pMy question is what approach should I take to be able to change those operations to asynchronous and how to define events when each methods finishes.

Negative 79111 pI basically want to create a region in a webpage that pops out i.e. on clicking something, it overlaps a part of the webpage. okay, so what I did is created a codedivcode and set its zindex greater than all other elements.  Then I used jQuery p  precodemyElement.hide codepre  pin the beginning and using jQuery, I made it to show using the onclick. Everything is perfect till now but this approach lacks fluidity.  What I mean by fluidity is that the showing and hiding of the region doesnt involves any effect.  So my question is, Is this approach correct Moreover, Can I add some kind of animation to make the showing and hiding a bit more interestingp

Negative 79111 pWhile trying to work on Casandra we Recently faced a strange issue.  Our current implementation is Cassandra  Spring MVC  Kundera.  p  pIssue We are trying to save the object via persist method of EntityManager. But the behaviour is very inconsistent, at times its not saving the details on DB. On checking the application logs there is no error or exception, rather it saves successfully. p  pAnother issue which we are facing is, While trying to debug some test set, we deleted a row from Casandra. And made the application to reinsert it. But after deleting and saving the row multiple times, Now it is not able to show the new records.. p  pThe Casandra server I  have is a single node server running on my machine. p  pPlease suggest. p
Negative 79111 pThe documentation for codeforkIOcode saysp  precodeGHC note the new thread inherits the masked state of the parent see mask.  The newly created thread has an exception handler that discards the exceptions BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar, BlockedIndefinitelyOnSTM, and ThreadKilled, and passes all other exceptions to the uncaught exception handler. codepre  pWhy does the child exception handler discard codeThreadKilledcode Is there some connection between the two threads after theyre createdp  pstrongWhat exactly happens when the parent thread dies Does the child get any exception raised Or is there any way at all to see from the childs perspective that the parent died Is there anything else that happens except that the parent thread just stops runningstrongp  pThe reason why Im asking this is that in many cases Im forced to create a thread in a context where I cant access the parents scope. Just imagine youre somewhere deep in a library and need to call codeforkIOcode, and have that thread die when the parent dies. Is it necessary to restructure the program and propagate the childs codeThreadIdcode up to the parent and explicitly kill it Or is there any other workaround for thisp

Negative 79111 pSometimes I want to track include files down to the line where a certain type is defined. For example, after adding a command in busybox, I found the added source is including kernel header file which includes other header files. But different from linux build procedure where the configuration define variablesCONFIG... is used to select correct header filesand select correct lines in the header file, in busybox building, those variables are not set so header files are being selected willynilly I guess.  p  pSo I want to track header files to see for example how the type u32 is typedefed and how the correct header files are selected during the build. If I get to know this, I can add some configuration to my busybox build procedure so that the right linux header files and lines would be selected to the final build.  p  pIs there any effective way to find the include file inclusion path I tried adding M to the CPPFLAGS while making a .o file to see what files are being included but there was no relevant information outputs.p  pEDIT  I used grep to find the files typedefing the type then and altered the typename of each candidate file to find the finally used header file. Then used grep to find files including that file. and altered the include filename to know out the real including filereal including file makes error during inclusion, because of the altered file name.. I repeated this and this way I could track the include path. Maybe this is the only methodp

Negative 79111 pI was going through concurrency section from a hrefhttppages.cs.wisc.eduremziOSTEP relnofollowREMZIa and while going through mutex section, and I got confused about thisp  pTo avoid busy waiting, mutex implementations employ codeparkcode  codeunparkcode mechanism on Sun OS which puts a waiting thread in a queue with its thread ID. Later on during codepthreadmutexunlockcode it removes one thread from the queue so that it can be picked by the scheduler. Similarly, an implementation of Futex mutex implementation on Linux uses the same mechanism.p  ol lipIt is still unclear to me where the queue lies. Is it in the address space of the running process or somewhere inside the kernelpli lipAnother doubt I had is regarding condition variables.

Negative 79111 pIm writing a Rack app to split hostnames ending with certain prefixes.p  pFor example, the hostname and port codehello.world.lvh.me3000code needs to be split into tokens codehello.worldcode, code.lvh.mecode and code3000code. Additionally, the prefix codehello.worldcode, suffix code.lvh.mecode and port code3000code are all optional.p  pSo far, I have a Ruby regex that looks like code..lvh.medcode.p  pThis successfully breaks the hostname into component parts but it falls down when one or more of the optional components is missing, e.g. for codehello.world3000code or codelvh.me3000code or even plain old codehello.worldcode.p  pIve tried adding codecode to each group to make them optional code..lvh.medcode but this invariably ends up with the first group, code.code, capturing the entire string and stopping there.p  pMy gut feeling is that this is something which might be solved using lookaround but Ill admit this is a totally new realm of regex for me.p

Negative 79111 pI am trying to load a file on click of a href on my JSP page. The file is not stored within the directory of the web server. Therefore, on clicking the href I may need to invoke an action which would read the file, copy it to the webserver in a temporary directory and then show to the user.

But how can this be achieved in struts 1.2 p  pOnly other solution I can think of is redirecting to another JSP page and then invoking its action classes to do the rest. But is it possible to call an action directly from an href p

Negative 79111 pSo my problem is like this I have 2 different repositories and I need to make a different, new one  containing files from these two. However the repositories share some files main.c for example which I want to merge manually... Ive tried to merge repos with this tutorial a hrefhttpblog.caplin.com20130918mergingtwogitrepositories relnofollowhttpblog.caplin.com20130918mergingtwogitrepositoriesa, however I only get one copy of main.c. Maybe I dont understand how git works Im pretty new to it, but I really need git to give me two files, which then I can manually change and make into a new main.c... I hope Ive made myself clear about my problem... I could just make two different working copies of those repositories, copy the content and make a new repo... But then the history would be lost, rightp

Negative 79111 pIm having some problems with updating the image of an UIImageView. I use a base image, that I modify by drawing in it before displaying. When displaying without the overlay, performance is fine. But when I generate the overlay, it takes close to 10 seconds before the view is updated. The base image is a 640x430 PNG file.

Negative 79111 pI have a file that gets new lines appended to it frequently. I want to create a web application running in the browser using javascript that will be able to detect changes on that local file and print the new content that is added on the file.p  pMy solution includes using javascript polling with setInterval and the new HTML5 File API. I load the file using an input file field and then poll the size of the file. Each time the size changes in my case increases this indicates to me that new content has been added to the file.

Negative 79111 pIm developing a code generator that have to generate JPA entities from database metamodel files. These model are from homebrewed modeling system which are being used to generate models other than JPA entities. p  pIn these models some fields are mapping back to same database column.

Negative 79111 pIm trying to learn how to work with threads and Im stuck with Concurrent Collections.p  pI have application, in which I have list codeunfinishedOBjectsListltMyObjectgtcode of objects and a method, that do some changes on specific object something like DoChangeMyObject object . After that, that object is taken from first list and inserted in codefinishedObjectsListltMyObjectgtcode.p  pNow, I wanted to run the method using threads, which was working fine  each thread did some changes changes are minor, so I added ThreadSleep to simulate some longer processing of object on specific object it found in unfinishedOBjectsList, removed it from unfinishedOBjectsList and put it in second list.p  pNext step I wanted to implement was that there would be another method handled by user using button for example, which would allow user to pick any object from the first list and remove it manualy. The problem I wanted to simulate was, that if the object is being processed by thread, user should not be able to remove it from list.p  pI tried ConcurrentQueue  but the problem is, that using Queue, I can not remove specific object using something like RemoveMyObject as I can do with list. After that, I tried ConcurrentBag and BlockingCollection, but the problem was the same  I was able to remove the next object in collection, but not for example object in the middle of the collection.p  pI have thought about using Dictionary, but I cant see reason why I should use dictionary with Key,Value parameters, while I only need to store the object.p  pMy question is  should I even use ConcurrentCollections for this case Or should I simply lock the list and leave it as it is What is the right approach when dealing with multipleaccess listsp  pThank Youp

Negative 79111 pI am using Camel 2.14.1 to build some RESTful services which use the Jackson json binding features of the Camel REST DSL. This is working great, but Id like to be able to send a custom response to a client when something goes wrong during the binding.p  pFor instance, if a codeNumberFormatExceptioncode is thrown when converting an input string value to an integer, because a client mistakenly sent characters which were not numbers. This exception is not a Jackson specific exception, so I cannot catch it to reply to a client with a binding failure message, as it could be a legitimate internal error.p  pSimilarly, Id like to catch any other exceptions thrown during the inbound binding of json to a POJO, and handle those in a similar way, at the very least informing the client that their payload was invalid.p  pSince this is all handled above my code, I cant see how to easily handle such errors, as its all dealt with in a library I have no control over. I am using Camels codeonExceptioncode clause to handle my own exceptions, so Im aware of that, just not sure how exactly to achieve what I need to...p  pWorst case, I guess I could take every client input as a string and bind it myself, but that seems to rather defeat the point of Jackson.p  ptldr Is there a pattern in Camel which would allow me to return a custom response when POJO binding fails from Jackson, using the REST DSLp  pstrongEditstrong  Heres some psuedocode to illustrate what Im trying to dop  precodeclass errorHandler     void handleExceptionExchange exchange, ExchangeException Exception exception       if myException.class.isAssignableFromexception.getClass         Set exchange body and response code header        This works as expected, though could probably do this more nicely           else if camelBindingOrJacksonBindingException         Some other custom handling like above, but specific for these exception types           else         Generic catch all with generic error response body        This also works fine          codepre  pCurrently I end up catching bindingJackson exceptions in the final else block, and thats what Im trying to avoid as really it would be more useful for the client to know their input wasnt valid. This seems equivalent to isaac.hazans answer below.p  pThe issue in doing this is that I cant find whether Jackson binding exceptions have a parent class which I can catch, a list of all such possible exceptions, or a way of telling that it came from binding.p  pThe second issue is that I cannot tell whether camel binding exceptions such as codeNumberFormatExceptioncode when Camel expects an int from a binding annotation on a method like codeHeader int numbercode, are genuinely from Camel, or from my own code. Very reluctant to catch any old codeNumberFormatExceptioncode because if further internal changes could throw this, Id end up returning an incorrect response. Is there maybe some way to figure out where the exception has come from whether it was at binding timep

Negative 79111 pIm trying to sort a child collection on one of my Domain Objects. Problem is the field that Im sorting by is one level deeper than each child, behind a ManyToOne relationship.p  precodeDomainObject gt Children OneToMany    gt ObjectHoldingSortInfo ManyToOne codepre  pCurrently I am doing it using a OrderBy using something analogous to the followingp  precodeBagx gt x.Children, x gt  x.OrderByObjectHoldingSortInfoTableAlias1.Priority , r gt r.OneToMany codepre  pBut the problem is that table alias is controlled by nHibernate and when Im trying to optimize this object by playing with things like lazy loading, eager fetching, joins, select, subselect, etc, this alias is fragile and will change. Generally its very fragile and a really poor way to do this.p  pI have tried using the overload of this method doingp  precodeBagx gt x.Children, x gt  x.OrderByy gt y.ObjectHoldingSortInfo.Priority , r gt r.OneToMany codepre  pBut this blows up with an errorp  precodeInvalid column name Priority. codepre  pI checked the SQL with NHProf, and found that the OrderBy is ignoring my ObjectHoldingSortInfo portion when trying to resolve the field, and its just looking for a Priority field on the child item itself.p  pI found out about the Sort option in nHibernate from a hrefhttpayende.comblog3943nhibernatemappingset relnofollowone of Ayandes blog postsa which will sort my collection in memory. Im fine with this, the order in the database doesnt matter, I just want them sorted when Im using them in the application without having to explicitly do it in every single location its ever used in the entire app.p  pThere are two overloads of the Sort method.p  precodevoid Sort void SortltTComparergt codepre  pI need the latter so I can specify that it should compare the specific field I need to accomplish the sorting. So I created a custom sort class.p  precodepublic class PrioritySortComparer  IComparerltChildItemClassgt      public int CompareChildItemClass x, ChildItemClass y              return x.Structure.Priority.CompareToy.Structure.Priority       codepre  pWhen I run the app nothing happens. Nothing is sorted. I tried changing my child items mapping to Set, and it blows up with a NotImplementedException Exception. for similar reasons as I had tried above, using a List mapping wont work because the field I want to sort by is not on the child item directly.p  pSo I started to look at the source code for the MappingByCode to see how the Sort methods are implemented. This is a summarized  view of what I found for the respective mapping implementations...p  precodepublic class BagMapper      public void Sort      public void SortltTComparergt    public class SetMapper      public void Sort              mapping.sort  natural           public void SortltTComparergt              throw new NotImplementedException       codepre  pHow exactly is Sort ever used when mapping by codep

Negative 79111 pI shall rewrite C code into Java. The core of original C code is a HW wrapper. In C we were using lots of unions for each HW register egp  precodetypedef union RegIntStatus     u8 reg    struct           u8 bit0abc1       u8 bit1cde1       u8 bit2xyz1       u8 bit37rsvd5     bits  regABC codepre  pthen we used it like p  precoderegABC r r.reg0 r.bits.bit0abc1 callr.reg codepre  pimagine there is plenty of those registers. Let say 40. How to implement it into java not having 40 class files I was thinking to create one class likep  precodeuniveraslregltTgt   where T will be some enum   public byte b   public byte setT bitmask,bool val       here is compile error it does not know variable bitmask.v     ifval b  bitmask.v          else b amp bitmask.v  0xFF     codepre  pthen one file can contains multiple enums likep  precodepublic static enum RegTst         b1abc0x01,         b2xyz0x02,         b3klm0x04         public byte v         RegTstint val             v  byteval               codepre  pthen I would use it likep  precodeuniveraslregltRegTstgt rt1 rt1.setRegTst.b2xyz,1 callrt1.b codepre  pBut it does not work because it seems I can not use enum variable .v in univeraslreg. It yields Java canot find symbol v. Do you know why Do you know how to code registers in order to havebr  preferably one filebr  type control between different registers eg  prenew univeraslregltRegTstgt.setRegTstOTHER.b2xyz,1pre shall lead to error as Im not using RegTst but RegTstOTHERbr  and mnemonic for bits eg RegTst.b1abcp

Negative 79111 pI use Delphi 7 and I encountered a very annoying thing. One of my projects has gone quite large and a form I used in one of the units became obsolete. I decided to get rid of it.

Then I commented out all sections that used anything in that unit and strongcompiledstrong, strongbulitstrong and strongranstrong the project. It went without any errors or warnings. I strongsaved all filesstrong and closed the Delphi IDE, started up a Notepad and removed the forms declaration from the unit, then deleted every associated file, except the .pas with this, it became like any other regular unit.p  pThen I searched every file in the projects folder with Total Commander to see if any of them contained the name of the removed unit.

Negative 79111 pMy current code base involves writing console applications in C where I import a static library containing many common classes.p  pI would like to move to Swift and replicate this process.  However, I have come across a couple difficultiesp  ul liAs it stands, one apparently cannot create static libraries in Swift.li liAs it stands, one apparently can not import a framework into a Swift console application.li ul  pCurrently I have been experimenting with writing a single view application and importing Frameworks that way, but enough has gone wrong that I would really like to simplify that and stick with console applications.p  pGiven that, so far it appears that my only option for code reuse is to keep Swift files in common directories and drag them as needed into the console application.  Since these console applications are for my own use and Im only interested in the data they generate i.e. I dont actually give the program to a user this is actually a workable solution.  I was hoping, however, there might be something a bit cleaner.p  pAny other suggestions on what to do for code reuse for pure Swift console applications, and if so, how do I go about doing itp

Negative 79111 pI dont do much client side web programming, so Im trying to grasp this concept in how it relates to my specific situation.p  pI have a RESTful WCF service running on a port in the 50000s.  Additionally, I have a bunch of web forms not ASP WebForms written in HTML5CSS3JavaScript that make AJAX calls to this WCF service.  The web forms are hosted on the same host, but are using port 80.  The AJAX calls made by the web forms are all codeGETcode only requests.p  pAdditionally, I have a thirdparty cloudhosted application thats in a completely different location different host, which needs to call the WCF service as well.  This communication is performing codePOSTcodes amp codePUTcodes to the WCF service.p  pObviously the calls being made from the thirdparty hosted cloud application is  cross origin.  From my research it appears that the different ports are in fact different origins.  p  pI know that security amp CORS are different concepts, but here is what Im trying to accomplish and I need to better understand how all of this worksbr  Right now I allow all crossorigin requests, and everything is working, but Id like to limit it down to improve security and then eventually set up HTTPS with transport security with both the webforms amp WCF service using the same certificate.  The thirdparty cloud service hostedapp would still need to be able to communicate with the WCF service so I would need to allow it to authenticate differently, so that would be done with a secretkey being passed since everything is serverside only.p  pThis whole communication triangle feels murky to me, and I hope that SO is the right place for me to be posting this question since it isnt directly code related.p  ol liIs the WCF  web forms situation described above considered crossoriginli listrongAstrong If the above is not crossorigin, would I then only need to pass the codeAccessControlAllowOrigin httpsmycloudhostcode in my web.configbr br  strongBstrong If it is I understand that just need to echo back the allowed originss in the header.  What do I set if anything for codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode in IIS in this case  What do I echo if its not allowed, just the original originli liWould my idea to use the same certificate for mutual SSL Authentication work if they are hosted on different ports  Would this prevent the cloudservice from communicating with the WCF service, or would having a second endpoint allow for thisli liAm I losing my mind  Im so confused by this whole thing.li ol

Negative 79111 pFirstly, I am using Fedora and learning OpenGL. I would like to work with DevIL a little, so I installed both DevIL and DevILILUT packages from the official repository. I have a test code for loading and rendering a file available, so I decided to test it I will be learning some DevIL basics at my course, and we were given that file to make sure DevIL works fine for us.p  pThe file contains linep  precodeinclude ILdevilcppwrapper.hpp codepre  pso I copied the IL directory which we also have available to the directory with test file IL directory contains a lot of header files, for example il.h, ilut.h, ilu.h, .... However, the build failed atp  precodeinclude ltILilut.hgt codepre  pfrom the ILdevilcppwrapper.hpp file. I dont get it, since I installed the packages. I tried putting every possible parameter to g since I didnt find any useful manual for it, maybe I am just blind, lIL, lILU, lILUT, ldevil, for every possibility it gives me the same error. I wasnt able to find any proper solution, so I gave up and copied the IL directory also to usrinclude. This time it gave me this error for every library includedp  precodeusrbinld cannot find ltparamgt codepre  pSo I deleted the directory, and tried replacing all system includes like the one in devilcppwrapper.hpp by ones in the directory since the files are called the same. The linker had the same issue, so I removed all library params and tried compiling it again, this time failing on undefined reference for DevILspecific functions.p  pWe have available also some files for dll DevIL.dll, ILU.dll, ILUT.dll and .lib to them, I tried linking also them, but still get the same undefined reference errors. Also, this course is made mainly for VS users, so I am not sure which files I should include.p  pI also tried building DevIL from their github source as is written in their README.unix file, but failed on the first step autoreconf i was failing for some libILUT.la I tried also autoconf i in case they have written it wrong, it failed for undefined win32 macro.p  pSo, my question is I am a noob who cant link DevIL. I tried everything I could think of, but cant find any solution. Can anyone help mep  pEDIT Since the build from github was failing, I decided to give it a chance and download their .tar and tried to compile from it. It seemed to be working at first, but then make returned undefined reference to pngsetgray124to8 and collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status. Even after this I tried to complete the build with make install, which of course failed too, but in this attempt I got a few libraries into usrlocallib. However, I still cant compile my test program, because the mentioned undefined reference to pngsetgray124to8, which the linker complains about now.p

On the initial screen, the user spends about 5 seconds to choose the content that will see, on the second screen, as it has the content itself, he spends about 30 seconds. So, the total session duration should be 35 seconds, but, unfortunately, as the second screen doesnt has an engagement hit, the 30 seconds spent on it are lost. This is terrible for my apps statistics.p  pI was wondering if could i create an event that fires automatically every 5 seconds to force an engagement hit and get the real users session duration on my app. Maybe an automatic event that fires a hit or data to analytics by event tracker, i dont know.p  pCould anybody help me Any idea to fix this failurep  pI got in contact with Googles support and they could not give me satisfactory answers.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 79111 pI am currently working on the highchart tooltip. p  pI have built one chart, the xAxis will show the dates and yAxis will show the value. When I click mouse and drag it, it will zoom in the area enclosed in the new highchart. This works well. However, there is one issue that when I drag mouse, the boundary of the new chart is determined by the position of the mouse rather than the line where the tooltip show upon.p  pFor example, when my mouse move to a position between code20150405code and code20150406code, my mouse position in x axis is some float value and I can see that when the mouse cross the midline the middle position between positions of these two dates on xAxis, the date on the tooltip changes. This cause me some trouble that, the date value determined by my mouse position and this is what I need to send to server is different from what I see on the tooltip. The tooltip may show code20150406code, but the value after rounding the position of mouse sent to server would be code20150407code.p  pWhat I want to do is to send the value showed on the tooltip to server rather than the value got from mouse.p  pI can see that, in tooltip formatter, there is a codethis.xcode. But I am not sure how to extract this value and using this value for server requestp

So I wanted to make it betterfaster. My idea is to have this script run the scan as a different script on each FS server and wait for them to return the output. That way it can scan on the local machine easier than remotely and it would scan both locations simultaneously.p  pThe other part of the problem comes in with the fact that I have no idea how to do this. I will continue to work on this and if I solve it, I will post here in case anyone in the future finds this useful. p

And what is even more odd is that it runs around 70 of the first visio documents just fine, but then for some unknown reason this error is triggered and non of the remaining documents get printed.p  pNow something I noticed, which may be of some use, is that whichever document the error is triggered on is then flung into read only compatibility mode so am not sure if that has anything to do with it.p  pNow obviously I have only given the section of code the error is coming from as the remainder of my code is quite long however if someone feels like the rest of the code would be helpful, just ask and I will get it.p  pThanks for any help,p  pCallump

Negative 79111 pIve got a docker image that contains a number of services. Ive been thinking about using Docker Compose to build this image, instead of packaging everything inside one great big image. p  pWhat Im having trouble with is the strategy for applying changes to the services with different versions of the main image. For example, one of the services is a postgres database, and sometimes the schema may change. When Im deploying a single monolithic image, I know exactly what version of the schema a user will get when they pull a specific version of the image. Im not sure what will happen if I use docker compose. When the user starts the new version of my image, will it always start with a clean postgres container, or will it reuse the existing containerp  pI can think of situations when reusing would be useful such as if the host machine goes down and I dont want the database to be lost, but if they pull a new image, Id want to know emfor certainem that they get a emcleanem container and that my main container can run the initial DDLDML scripts to prepare it properly. Is this even a valid concernp

Negative 79111 pId like to change the behaviour of codecode and codecode in vim for tex files.p  pIn tex files paragraphs are typically separated by one or more blank lines.p  pThe cursor should be placed similarly to nroff macros e.g. code.shcode on the first line of the paragraph not on the separating blank line. Afaik, adjusting codeset paragraphscode does not allow this a hrefhttplearnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.comchapters50.htmlnrofffiles relnofollowsee herea.p  pNoteworthy corner cases would be codeindentcode, codenoindentcode, codeparagraphcode, codesubparagraphcode and probably more.

Even when I use codeparagraphcode I add a blank line before it.p  pSo this question should be limited to blank lines and placing the cursor on the next nonblank line.p  pstrongAlternativelystrong, I would not mind setting up new movement mappings.p  pHowever, they should be convenient. codegcode and codegcode do not feel this way.p  h3Remarksh3  ul limappings should not touch search history.li licodejumplistcode should be modified same behaviour as codecode and codecode.li ul  pThis question is motivated by the nice plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comjunegunnlimelight.vim relnofollowcodelimelight.vimcodea by junegunn.p

Negative 79111 pThis is my first time asking a question on this forum.  I hope i can be specific enough.  I am trying to replace the front page posts section of a WP template.

Id like to keep it set to static for a few reasons.  My question is Is there a reason why the code below would only work in an index.php file and not out of a blogtemplate file which is is in the same location as the index.php file.

Ive found a couple of people with similar issues for this very specific library, but in their case it was just that they forgot to link the dependencies on VS Properties... Ive posted this same problem in the SimpleAmqpClients Git Issues too, just in case its due to any incompatibility that Im not aware of...p  pAny tip, idea or suggestion to solve this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 79111 pAs detailed in a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32865389threejsobjectpickingdoesntreportparentobjectnameonobjectloadedwithprevious questiona I have learned how to use THREE.js OBJMTLLoader by using the same objects amp materials used in the a hrefhttpthreejs.orgexampleswebglloaderobjmtl.html relnofollowofficial examplea. p  pThat example uses a for me complex model with the DDSLoader.p  pI would like to load simpler OBJMTL models and have been trying with several free models obtained from the web.

Negative 79111 pIve seen enough answers to know you cant easily check for columns in SQLITE before adding.  Im trying to make a lazy persons node in NodeRed where you pass a message to SQLITE which is the query.  Adding a table if it does not exist is easy.p  precodemsg.topiccreate table IF NOT EXISTS fred id PRIMARY KEY node.sendmsg codepre  pit occurred to me that adding a table which had the names of the fields would be easy  and if the field name is not in the table.... then add the field. BUT you cant add multiple fields at once  so I cant do this...p  precodemsg.topiccreate table IF NOT EXISTS fred id PRIMARY KEY, myfields TEXT node.sendmsg codepre  pThe problem with THAT is that I cant add this in later, theres no way to check before adding a field it the table existsp  pThis is what I WANTp  precodemsg.topiccreate table IF NOT EXISTS fred id PRIMARY KEY, myfields TEXT node.sendmsg  msg.topicif not select address from myfields alter table fred add column address text codepre  pI just cannot think of any way to do this  any ideas anyone the idea is that the nodered node would input a table, field and value and if the table didnt exist it would be created, if the field didnt exist it would be created, all before trying to add in the value.p
