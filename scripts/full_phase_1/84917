Positive 84917 pHi this is my first post here,p  pwhen i am using for example the MYSQL command line tool with a simple query like select  from table, i obviously get the table content printed to the command line. If i am missspelling the query i obviously get a MYSQL error printed.p  pNow, i was wondering if there is any way i can get these kind of outputs from the command line, when i am executing a query via JDBC, and put them in string.p  pMy goal is to implement two textfields in a Java GUI, one as input for executing a MYSQL query, one for displaying the output that i would get if i were using the command line tool. It is basically a command line tool implemented in Java.p  pI looked thoroughly via google but couldnt find anything. I wasnt too shure what exactly to look for anyway. How do you call the output of the command line tool I tried trace, stacktrace but i wasnt surep  pThank you very much in advance.p

Positive 84917 pUsually on unix systems you can suppress command output by redirecting STDIN andor STDERR to a file or devnull.

Its just an example, though  Im not searching for a solution to this command in specific but to that kind of situation in general.

Positive 84917 pI am having trouble implementing my pipe. It reads Unix terminal commands from a text file for commands such as lswc where it opens a pipe so that the output of ls can be used for wc.p  pI have implemented it to parse program names ls, wc and store them in two separate arrays arguments and arguments2, fork a child process, then have that child fork another child process, then the second child process calls the execvp command and passes the first program to be executed.p  pThe output from ls is then written to the pipe by changing the standard output. The former child process then execvps the other process wc and reads from the pipe by changing the standard input.p  pHowever, wc loops indefinitely and does not seem to count the number of words from ls. Ls executes in a directory where there are words to be counted.p  pAny tips Thank you so much and sorry for the long explanation. p  pHere is a simpler example It forks, creates a pipe, and implements ls and writes its output to the pipe, goes back to the parent and reads from the pipe the output of ls. It still seems to be reading forever or not working right.p  precode   main.cpp   PipeTest    Created by Dillon Sheffield on 92815.   Copyright  2015 Dillon Sheffield.

Positive 84917 pIm in the middle of my first assignment, and Im totally and utterly stuck.p  pThe user inputs the New Purchase Price of their vehicle, eg 40000, and then the output has to show the dollar amount for Age and Distance Depreciation. These calculations are as followsp  pstrongagedepreciationrate  years since manufacture date  1  5strongp  pstrongdistancedepreciationrate  distancetravelled  10000  2strongp  pIm okay with that part, but the actual output is in a decimal format, e.g 0.4, which means 40 of New Purchase Price. What Im trying to work out is how to output as a percentage of the New Purchase Price, so that 0.4 actually converts to 40 and shows the output. E.g 40 of 40000  16000.p  pIf anyone can point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

I use one table per subclass strategy i.e. codeInheritancestrategy  InheritanceType.JOINEDcode, for these classes. p  pWhat I have observed was the generated SQL uses left outer join HisClubUser and MyClubUser when I do a query on User class. Why Hibernate does that [joining other tables] where my concern is only User My point is even though the data is retrieved, I would not able to access these properties in MyClubUser or HisClubUser given that User instances are returned. Also, does this causes additional overhead as compared to a query where it just query User table without the left outer joinp  pThanks p

The first time you rotate portrait  landscape everything is fine. But when you rotate back, the table disappears. No clue why, and Im banging my head against the wall as to finding a solution.

No dice there either.p  pIve also tried fiddling with the bounds and frame of self.tableView, as well as self.tableview.contentOffset, but none of that seems to have any effect whatsoever.p  pIs there some example out there that Im failing to google that already shows exactly what I want to do emwith rotationem Id imagine this is a very common situation, but I havent been able to find anything.p  pSo I guess my question is, has anyone else ran into something like this before, and can at least point me in the right direction of where to look Or knows of some common pitfalls that maybe Im missing Im about to just say screw it and not allow rotation in the Edit Details view, but considering thats when users are most likely to want a landscape keyboard Id really like to have it if possible...p  pThanks for any help anyone can provide.p

Im giving it something that inherits from something that is an codeAsyncCallbackltObjectgtcode. I guess with generics, concepts of inheritance get somewhat brokenp  pstrongSo my question is thisstrongp  pemEitherem how can I mush this together so that codeDoSomethingcode will recognize that that codeSpecificCallbackcode meets its requirements,p  pemorem how can I structure the relationship between codeCallbackBasecode and codeSpecificCallbackcode so that duplicate code is avoided, but codeSpecificCallbackcode implements codeAsyncCallbackltIntegergtcode directlyp  pThanks.p

Negative 84917 pAlright, Im at my wits end on this issue.p  pFirst, backstory. Im working on a video management system where were allowing users, when adding new content, to upload and, optionally, transcode a media file. Were using Java applet for the browserbased FTP client.p  pWhat I want to do is allow a user to initiate an upload and then send the FTP connection instance to a popup window. This window will act as a job queue for the FTP transfer process. This will allow users to move about the main interface without having to stay on the original page until an individual file transfer is complete.p  pFor the most part I have all of this working, but heres a problem. If the window is closed, all connections are dropped and the upload process for all queued files will be canceled.p  pSo, if Window One opens the Popup Window, adds stuff to the queue, refreshes the screen or moves to a different page, how will I access the Popup Windowp  pThe popup window and its contents must remain persistent while the user navigates through the original window. The original window must be able to access the popup to add a new job to the queue. The popup window itself is independent of the opening window, so communication only happens in one directionp  pParent  Popupp  pNotp  pParent lt Popupp  pWindow.opennull, WINDOWNAME will not work in this case. I need to check if a window exists BEFORE using window.open.p  pHelpp

Negative 84917 pSo I am learning WCF and I have run across an issue that I believe has to do with Instance ControlState but I am not sure.p  pWorkflow is as follows, Basic clientserver paradigm.p  ol lipThe client calls a Method RetrieveBusinessObjectscriteria and the server calls the datalayer and then puts them in an IList on the server side. It does not return this list to the calling Client.pli lipThe client would then call a  method say DisplayBusinessObjects which would retrieve the  IList from the Server, serialize them, bring them across the wire and display them.pli ol  pIf i try this using the WCFTestClient it works. If I run it from an actual client then I get back an BusinessObject[] of size 0. Which to me indicates I had no objects to return.p  pIs that a state mgmt issue or am I missing somethingp
Negative 84917 pI notice that Java has a number of ancillary scripting languages. Clojure and Groovy for example. My understanding is that these can be used when the full might and power of Java does not need to be applied and a speedy cludge can be hacked in GroovyClojure.

Is there a similar scripting in XCode  I was not so interested in Python or Ruby in this situation as they are languages in their own right added in, as indeed I think can happen in Java, but I was looking for a purpose built tools.p  pQuestion 2.

Negative 84917 pHi I have two images of yeast platesp  pPermissivep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgXmKn.jpg altalt textp  pXgalp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comilT71.png altalt textp  pThe to images should be in the same spot and roughly the same size. I am trying to use one of the images to generate a grid and then apply that grid to the other image. The grid is made by looking at the colonies on permissive plate, the plate should have 1536 colonies on it.  The problem is that the camera that was used to take the images moves a bit up and down and the images can also be shifted slightly due to the other plate not being in exactly the same place. This then means that when I use the permissive plate to generate the grid on the xgal plate the grid shifts. Does anyone know a way in which I can compensate for this  I am using perl with the gd module.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank youp

Negative 84917 pWe are working on a data grid and found out that during moving rows TR in a table TABLE with jQuery the table may get corrupt under Chrome Firefox and Opera works great.

I couldnt generate a clean and easy test case yet, but just want to ask if there is a known problem with that in Chrome.p  pIt really seems buggy as detaching the whole table and reattaching it again without changing something else does solve the problem and the table layout is correct again.p

Negative 84917 pIm trying to make a simple image viewer for viewing the full resolution image of an ALAssetRepresentation. It turns out its not quite that simple.p  pMy first approach was to just make a big UIImageView inside the UIScrollView. While this did work, it was very slow.p  pWhen using the Photos app, when you touch an image, the larger version opens instantly. At first, theres a very low resolution image being drawn. But shortly, a higher resolution image appears. Also, if I zoom in, the image is first lower resolution and then the resolution increases.p  pI checked out the WWDC 2010 keynote 104 where it is described how Photos.app works. But how am I supposed to implement this In the keynote, the demo uses pretiled images, something which I cannot get from an ALAssetRepresentation just like that. Ive tried just loading the full resolution version and just drawing it using CATiledLayer and while its not slow for zooming et.c, its way too slow when drawing the tiles.p  pIs Photos.app caching a lower resolution version of all images somewhere or whats going on Some pointers on what to do would be helpful.p

Negative 84917 pIs there a clever way to vectorize a forloop which assigns elements to submatrices of a matrixbr Initially, I had two forloops  p  precodeUzeros6M2,M2 for k2M3       ik161      for j2M3         Uii5,jAtempii5,jBtempii5,j1Ctempii5,j1Dtempi6i1,jEtempi6i11,j     end end codepre  pThen I vectorized the inner loop, such that the code now readsp  precodeUzeros6M2,M2 j2M2 for k2M3     ik161     Uii5,jAtempii5,jBtempii5,j1Ctempii5,j1Dtempi6i1,jEtempi6i11,j end codepre  pThis has reduced my CPU time by more than 90, so I wondered if I could do the same with the outer loop, but it seems a bit tricky, since I assign to 6x1matrices within the U matrix. I tried p  precodeUzeros6M2,M2 k2M3 ik161 j2M2 Uii5,jAtempii5,jBtempii5,j1Ctempii5,j1Dtempi6i1,jEtempi6i11,j codepre  pbut this fails, since ii5 only takes out the first 6 indices I want. p  pI have also tried to use the reshape function to convert the matrix into a vector, but it still seems difficult to assign to several blocks of elements at once. There are in total three such forloops in the code, so I guess an alternative optimization is to parallelize them somehow. However, without access to the parallel toolbox, vectorization seems to me as a good solution if possible.p  pThe code is part of a subroutine in a numerical finite difference method for solving a system of 6 equations on a grid, so this question could be relevant for anyone working with matrix calculations on systems of equations, particularly a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPartialdifferentialequation relnofollowPDEsa.

Negative 84917 pI have a Rails 3 app where the views are all done in Haml. However, there are some views coming from a required gems that are in ERB, and Haml is adding whitespace, and its messing up textareas and such. If youre not familiar with this aspect of haml, a hrefhttphamllang.comdocsyardocfile.FAQ.htmlqpreserve relnofollowlook herea.p  pId rather not have to convert my layout to ERB, and because the gem is in ERB, all of the traditional Haml whitespace solutions dont help.p  pSo how do I get my textareas and ltpregts etc not to wrap Anything smart I can do in my app is good, otherwise Id be happy to apply a patch to the original gem.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong I think I might have figured out a few decent answers.p  pOne thing that works on the haml end is codeHamlTemplate.options[ugly]  truecode, which eliminates all whitespace. Meh, this might be the best solution, but wheres my whitespace  I liked it, when it wasnt messing up my app.p  pAnother idea was to patch the gem to automatically convert n characters to ampx000A in a beforesave, which mimics what Haml does in the link i linked to in my original question... but that might be a bit of a pain.p  pThe final solution I came up with, which also seems to work, is to create a form.html.haml document that sits right next to the form.html.erb document in the plugin, and is identical. Apparently, the plugin doesnt need to depend on Haml, but if the parent app is rendering Haml, itll look for a haml view before it looks for an ERB view. Theres one caveat, though, and thats that Haml actually needs to be loaded at the beginning of the app. So I have a line at the bottom of application.rb now that just says Haml all by itself.p  pSo for anybody else having this problem, now youve got 3 solutions to pick from, and if youve got a better one, please post itp

Negative 84917 pAlright.. I guess to start this off I am looking to sometime in the near future start building a web based or browser based application that I want to build a part of the interface to be a gps module. this will be for a self hosted application likely on tablets or laptops where it will use the data for tracking information amongst other things. Any way most of the application is being handled in PHP, mySQL, jQuery. So with that my question is, is there any way to build a gps application with that as the core languages used. If it is possible, whats the best gps unit I can use remember im not nessisarily looking for a fancy gps unit to do this with.. just a transmitterreciever is fine so long as I can build software of my own around it, also is it actually possible to do this with something like phpjquery or is this something I would have to go the route of maybe java to handle the hardware transactions of which I can tie phpjquery into that..p

Negative 84917 pTypically when you build and debug Android application, you would have codedebuggabletruecode in manifest and you would sign application with development key.p  pWhen it is time to release your application you would need to change to codedebuggablefalsecode, sign with your own key, optionally run ProGuard and possibly do something else.p  pCertain external operations like signing with different key can be easily coded with Ant. In fact those tasks come out of the box. However, changes in codeAndroidManifest.xmlcode seem to require manual intervention every time. p  pAnother aspect is maintaining release versions of application. For example, out of the box Android tasks will not use any version information. Maven will use SNAPSHOT versions and will require manual update for the release.p  pDealing with all those issues is quite tedious and some automation is highly desirable. So far my approach was to create separate branch in git for release where I would keep final manifest, as well as poms with correct version.p  pBut I would like some advice from other people on best practices for dealing with Android release cycle.p  pAny recommendationp

Negative 84917 pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pIve found that when removing codewidth100code from the div, I get the results I want interms of it having 0 height if it contains no content.  However, I need the div to have a width of 100, which for some reason is forcing it to have a height without content.p  pHere is a jsfiddle of the problem.  You will only see the problem if you go to the following link with IE7, maybe on IE6 and below.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netRQeeg2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netRQeeg2ap  pstrongORIGINAL QUESTIONstrongp  pI have an empty div which has a height for some reason.p  pOn Chrome, the div does not appear at all unless it contains content.  IE7 on the other hand shows the div even if it has no content.p  pSo basically, I want it to have a height of 0px if it is empty, and automatically adjust its height if it has content.  Which is exactly how it behaves if it does not have a width of 100.p

Negative 84917 pI have made a simple paint program in which you can use a brushtool to paint some different colors and erase simply paint in white.p  pIt works fine, but I have a very strange graphical bug which causes the toolpanel and the last mouseovered colortoolicon to be painted on top of the drawpanel.p  pImplementation The frame holds two extentions of JPanel a ToolPanel and a DrawPanel. ToolPanel holds two JPanels which hold the color and toolbuttons. The Buttons are extensions of JComponent.p  plink to screenshot Im not allowed to post images appearentlyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcdzui.png altenter image description herep  pnote The buttons in the second fake toolpanel are not actual buttons that can be clicked and I can paint on top of it. If I paint on the fake color button in the left corner it will be repainted again when I mouseover a new color and enter the drawpanel with the mouse.p  pnote 2 I used to have a JMenuBar which was also painted in the drawpanel. It was repainted each time the drawpanel is mouseovered after the window not just the panel lost focus once.p  pSome code I know the tool selection implementation isnt the best Pp  pDrawPanels paintComponent methodp  precode    public void paintComponentGraphics g       ifisMousePressed          iftool  BRUSH              g.setColorcolor             g.fillOvalcurrentEvent.getX, currentEvent.getY, 30, 30          else iftool  ERASER              g.setColorgetBackground             g.fillOvalcurrentEvent.getX, currentEvent.getY, 30, 30                 codepre  pLet me know if there is any relevant information or code that I left out.p  pHypothesis I didnt call super.paintComponent in DrawPanels paintComponentmethod, maybe that causes some problems The reason that I didnt is that if I do, it will repaint the background all the time so only the dot I painted last will be visible. Not sure if the supercall actually solves the problem or if the fakepanel is just covered by the background as well. Maybe I need to work around that some other way Or is it something else p  pThanksp

A controller class will be responsible forp  ul liWatching a folder for a newly added fileli liReading the file contentsli liObtaining a collection of these IFileProcessor concrete implementations li liOne by one call the ProcessFile on each component, passing the file contentsli liIf a component cannot process the file it returns false, otherwise it will process the contents and return trueli liIf no IFileProcessor implementation can process the file it is moved by the controller to a UnProcessed folderli liIf a component successfully processes the file it is moved to the Processed folderli liIf an exception is thrown by a component it is moved to a Failed folderli ul  pI am creating an implementation of IFileProcessor which will firstly check if it can process the file based on the type i.e. csv and will then perform some top level validation i.e. check file headers. If any of these checks fail an exception will the thrown to the controller, as the entire file is seen as invalid.p  pHowever once the top level validation has been successful the component will process each line in the file. From this point onwards it is acceptable for an individual line to fail processing i.e. validation, and the rest of the process to continue. p  pThis is where the problem lies, I am wondering if its best to log that validation errors have occurred and then throw an exception at the end of the process, or to change the ProcessFile signature to return an enum one of Processed, UnProcessed, ProcessedWithErrorsp  pFrom what I have read it seems that exceptions are the preferred route over status codes, however in this particular circumstance where a process can continue it seems wrong to use an artificial exception at the end to state the process did not complete 100.p  pI would be really interested in peoples thoughts on this.p

Negative 84917 pI have a fairly simple app. Its a Unity client of a server that provides data frames between 5 and 8k in size. This is running locally same machine, or two machines on the same router at the moment, with intent to go wider.p  pThe problem is, when Im connected, my frame rate is horrible, like 3 to 6 FPS. When not connected, well above 30 FPS. I would not have thought that grabbing 5k chunks via a socket would have such a huge impact. I must be doing something wrong.p  pFrom what I can tell, Im not blocking. I use an async callback to gather the incoming data, which usually takes two or three callbacks to get, before stuffing that in a final buffer to deliver to my app.p  pIm not a networking guru, but I know some of you are. Is this just a limit of Mono Or .NET 2.0 Is there a more efficient way of getting data of this size across a network TCP I dont think this is like a noisy connection, even localhost runs this slow. Would it help to put the socket stuff in an assembly Or a DLLp  pIve asked at the Unity forums, no takers thus far.p

Assume Indexes are inplace on the FKs.p  precode TABLE Lookup       LookupID int not null PK      Name nvarchar255 not null     TABLE Document       DocumentID int not null PK      PreviousID null FK REFERENCES DocumentDocumentID     TABLE DocumentLookup       DocumentID int not null FK REFERENCES DocumentDocumentID      LookupID int not null FK REFERENCES LookupLookupID   codepre  pVolumes  Document, 4 Million rows of which 90 have a null PreviousID field value Lookup, 6000 rows, Average lookups attached to each document 20 giving DocumentLookup 80 Millions rows.p  pNow in a .NET Service have structure to represent a Lookup row like thisp  precode struct Lookup         public int ID       public string Name       public Listltintgt DocumentIDs   codepre  pand that lookup rows are stored in a codeDictionaryltint, Lookupgtcode where the key is the lookup ID.  An important point here is that this dictionary should contain entries where the Lookup is referenced by at least one document, i.e., the list codeDocumentIDscode should have Count  0.p  pMy task is populate this dictionary efficiently.  So the simple approach would bep  precode  SELECT dl.LookupID, l.Name, dl.DocumentID   FROM DocumentLookup dl   INNER JOIN Lookup l ON l.LookupID  dl.LookupID   INNER JOIN Document d ON d.DocumentID  dl.LookupID   WHERE d.PreviousID IS NULL   ORDER BY dl.LookupID, dl.DocumentID codepre  pThis could then be used to populate a the dictionary fairly efficiently.p  pstrongThe Questionstrong strikeDoes the underlying rowset delivery TDS perform some optimization  It seems to me that queries that denormalise data are very common hence the possiblity that field values dont change from one row to the next is high, hence it would make sense to optomise the stream by not sending field values that havent changed.  Does anyone know whether such an optomisation is in placestrike  Optomisation does not appear to exist.p  pWhat more sophisticated query could I use to eliminate the duplication Im think specifically of repeating the name value  Ive heard of such a thing a nested rowset, can that sort of thing be generated Would it be more performant How would I access it in .NETp  pI would perform two queries one to populate the Lookup dictionary then a second to populate the ditionary lists.  I would then add code to knock out the unused Lookup entires.  However imagine I got my predictions wrong and Lookup ended up being 1 Million rows with only a quarter actually referenced by any documentp

Negative 84917 pIve created a custom widget, which uses a bunch of floated divisions, Im having a issue with internet explorer though. After playing around a bit, I found that the problem was with setting inline css. p  pI have a class extending ComplexPanel, which sets the element to a division, and offers a bunch of helper functions to set various inline CSS.p  pIf I add say, 3 divisions using this DIV wrapper class, which all are being floated left, and set to 100px using inline css set with getElement.getStyle.setProperty, then they act odd in IE8. it works fine in IE9.p  pBasically, none of the inline CSS is being picked up. Using the developer tools shows the CSS is there, but its not being applied. If I disable the float or width for that matter and enable it again, using the developer tools, the inline CSS is picked up and it works as intended.p  pSo, how can I inform IE8 that it needs to reinterpret inline CSS on dynamically generated elements p

I suppose all C are being cached or stored somehow. The problem with this is that, for example, C calls a UIImagePickerController the first time it enters but not the second one. Whyp  pThe UIImagePickerController is presented inside Cs viewDidLoad, by a line likep  p[self.navigationController presentModalViewControllerpicker animatedYES]p  pbut obviously, if C is being cached viewDidLoad will not run the second time, and this is why the picker is not being called, except for the first time. p  pI like the idea of a cached VC, because it is fast as hell to go back and forward, but, where should I put the call to the picker, so it is called correctly I thought it would be viewWillAppear, but I tried that and this method is never called.p  pany ideas thanksp

The handling of variables and assignments can be embedded as special cases within the logical structure above, or it can be done in separate logic beforeafter the expression is evaluated. Your calculator class will need a field to store the value of each variable x, y, and z. In an assignment, the first operand is a variable name and the first operator is . The value of the expression to the right of  must be evaluated, and the value then can be stored in the field corresponding to the variable. If x, y, or z occurs in the expression to the right of , its current value can be found in the corresponding field. The variables can be replaced with their values in the code that gets the next operand, or the variable values can be inserted in a separate pass through the expression before it is evaluated.p  pstrongAny help, inciteful links, or suggestions would be greatstrongp  pstrongIm new on the programming scene and would like to learn.strongp

So far I am able to insert new Keywords related to my Post and I am using append. Which is wrong I know. So what happens is that the next time a non unique keyword occurs in a blog post it will throw an error about Conflict with Keyword since keywords are supposed to be uniquep  pI know the right way is something else, I just dont know what. I have seen an example of  getorcreatekeyword which basically filters by keyword and then adds it if not found. However I believe as data size grows this will also be wrong.

I wish to keep that but avoid this duplicate key issue.p  pEdit found the solution, SQLAlchemy docs guide you towards error but the explanation is in there. I have added the answer.p

Negative 84917 pI am building a Backbone.js application with a Javabased backend. On the java side, the app is pretty much established. However, on the client side, there is a tiny detail I have to add. As part of a promotional campaign, I have to make sure that a permanent flash message is displayed to any user who is not logged in, as well as to any loggedin user, who hasnt intentionally closed it. p  pI know that normally, the best way to do it is to store the user decision in a boolean variable in the DB. The problem comes from the fact that I do not want to mess my backend code and the database with something like promotional messages. Therefore, I thought that maybe cookies set up from the client could help. However, this has the problem that I may end up with a separate cookie for every single account logged in form the same browser instance. And that just for one message. Plus, I cannot transfer cookies across browsers, so my users may end up seeing the message againp  pI am stuck. Please help. What I want is not even code, but just a few comments whether I am on the right track. If not, I will store in the DB anyway. It is just a bit of overhead for something as silly as promotional messages. Maybe redis can helpp

But I wasnt sure how to achieve the text layout large number on top of small textp  pId also like active tabs to have a pointer as shown and this lead me to think that maybe instead of a UL I should float 3 dives and make each one a link.

Negative 84917 pIn my project, I want to implement a template proxy class of some existing bigger classes. The existing classes are library classes, so they can not be modified. In most cases, the clients do not know the objects are instances of proxy class or bigger class. In some cases, however, the clients MUST know the detailed class information. Since the proxy class is itself a template class, I do not think simple function overloading by class name could solve this problem. The possible solution I thought is to add an internal nested class or typedef inside the proxy class, and the client check whether this classtypedef exists to get the class information.

Negative 84917 pI am using Ruby on Rails and devise for authentication. I have a usercustomer model and a business model. I want userscustomers to sign up through a particular business and belong to a particular business. A business has many userscustomers, but a user only belongs to one business. I ended up wanting to have businesses be able to use a sub domain of their own domain to correspond to their own id, but now that Im getting to that point I have no idea how to approach that.. p  pHonestly Im still in high school and I dont have a good idea of how everything comes together with something like this. So Im planning on licensing this app to businesses already have a few that have paid up front before Ive developed this thing. Each businesss data needs to be separate from the other businesses. Some businesses dont have a domain at all so I will have to use a sub domain on my server. And some businesses do have a website so I want to use a sub domain through their businesss domain.p  pIm now thinking it is definitely better to use multiple databases.. Honestly I have very limited knowledge of database structures. I believe its possible to run separate individual apps which Ive been thinking may be the best way to roll this. Also maybe the easiest to developmaintainp  pSo my questions are what are the tradeoffs of running multiple databases vs running separate individual apps And where would I found out more information on how to actually do this Also could anyone lead me into the right direction on how to forward these domain or we I have to dop  pAlso please comment if my question wasnt clear enough... and sorry its so long lol.p

How would this be different with gitp blockquote  h2Easy branchingh2  pGits branching is lauded by many as one of its strongets feature. However, branching in CVSSVN seems to be sufficient to many engineers, especially with modern IDE that make the entire experience and workflow almost identical irrespective of which RCS is actually used.p  blockquote   pWhen I want to try out an idea, I right click my project node in Eclipse, select Switch to different branch, select new, type the name and Im away, committing and updating without polluting the mainline as CVS apparent does.    When I have decided that the new ideas in this branch are stable and good, I right click the project again, select merge with another branch or version, select HEAD and we are back in HEAD but with working changes implemented... How would git improve my experiencep blockquote  h2Truly distributedh2  pThe main advantage in using a distributed RCS seems to be disaster recovery. However, similar properties are inherent in CVS and SVN as well. This is particularly the case for standard practise usagep  blockquote   pNow I consider it standard practice for the first thing to do in the morning is check the repository for any changes made overnight and do an updatemerge if needed so, should I go home tonight and find my repository has been burnt to the ground in the morning, I would of lost...well...nothing.  I would create a new repo, commit my local files to the server, the other 5 employees would do the same, there would maybe be a bit of merge fuss but no more than there would of been had we of been committing our local changes to an already existing server and we are away once more.  No big deal.p blockquote  pstrongGIT Stagingstrongp  pAnother feature that is often mentioned is the staging area. This has no equivalent in SVNCVS and allows a developer to craft his commit to include on the files you want.nbsp  p  pOften, when this is mentioned, I simply think of changesets. strongHow is the staging area differentstrongp  hr  pIndeed, I even see some strongdisadvantagesstrong of using Gitp  ul liLocal commits mean that the likelyhood of loosing code is greater, as my development machine is much more vulnerable than our SVN server, and my work is at risk before I push it to our common repository.li liOffline working has no perceptible advantage, since most developers will never work on a project while offline.  li ul  pI feel as though I must be missing or misunderstanding something fundamental about git and am having a hard time justifying the business case for the switch. I would greatly appreciate your input to better my understanding of the issues involved, especially if you can you identify concrete use cases where git would be a fundamentally superior solution than CVSSVN rather than simply an incrementally better onep

Negative 84917 phere was my situation.p  pI was using paperclip to let user upload images. It did well and everything was okay. Then,I pushed it to heroku. For the momment, I can see all my images that was just upload by users. However, everytime make a new commit and push to heroku again, all of my previous images gone. Its seems like dont have the file anymore,cant load it.p  pSo,here what i thought Is it every time i pushed to the heroku server, the images file that was in local was uploaded to the heroku serverp  pI did research for my problem for it,and im not really understand what they actually said about heroku and i dont know is it is the same problem with me.p  blockquote   pHeroku has a readonly filesystem. That means Paperclip cannot save uploaded files to any place within Heroku.p      pIf you would like to be able to upload files to an application hosted on Heroku, then you must either store the files as binary blobs within your database or you must use a separate service to store the files. If you are looking for a separate service, Paperclip has builtin support for integrating with Amazon S3.p blockquote  pI found out that Amazon S3 need credit card to register,if i do not have credit card,then i cannot use their services p  pAny detail advices and explaination is appreciated .Thanks youp

Negative 84917 pFolks, please be gentle, I am not a professional programmer, just a site admin and I need some help. Here is my problemp  pI am running a web site, with php. I would like to show pictures to my members, but I would like those pictures to remain within specific size limits, so they do not cause the visitors to scroll horizontally in order to view the whole picture. So far, I have limited the size of uploaded pictures to 800x600 as a least common denominator. However, I believe that users with larger monitors should be allowed to see larger pictures, so I plan to remove that 800x600 limit, but I still would like to make sure that the image displayed wouldnt be larger than the visitor viewport actually lets say 23s of the viewport.p  pNow, I understand that php runs on the server and javascript runs on the client and that there is no easy way to pass the viewport dimensions to the php code, I tried and failed miserably, so that is clear.p  pBut Ive also read especially in this site that there are ways to do it, using JQuery andor Ajax. My main problem I do not know how to program in Javascript, JQuery or Ajax. So my question is What exactly should I include in my php file to cause the client to return the browser width to the php file or my html template, in order to use the browser width in the  statement my program generates p  pIf I understand this right, when a visitor asks to see a page and my server send them the result of my page, there should be some code, which will send me back the browser width, then the server will resend the page, using the value it received. Am I correct in that If thats the way it works, it would be ideal if I could get that browser width value and store it in a php global variable, so that not every page is generated twice. Can that be done p  pPlease be very specific, as I said, I am a newbie on these things.p  pNeedless to say, any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pMany thanks for your attention.p  pP.S. I have already download and installed JQuery in my server, but I have no idea how to use it for this problem.p

Negative 84917 pI am using Hadoop to analyze a very uneven distribution of data.  Some keys have thousands of values, but most have only one.  For example, network traffic associated with IP addresses would have many packets associated with a few talkative IPs and just a few with most IPs.  Another way of saying this is that the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGiniindex relnofollowGini indexa is very high.p  pTo process this efficiently, each reducer should either get a few highvolume keys or a lot of lowvolume keys, in such a way as to get a roughly even load.

I know that Hadoop sorts the records that were produced by the mappers, so this list must exist somewhere.  It might be distributed among several partitioner nodes, in which case I would do the splitting procedure on one of the sublists and somehow communicate the result to all other partitioner nodes.  Assuming that the chosen partitioner node sees a randomized subset, the result would still be approximately loadbalanced.  strongDoes anyone know where the sorted list of keys is stored, and how to access itstrongp  pI dont want to write two mapreduce jobs, one to find the splits and another to actually use them, because that seems wasteful.  The mappers would have to do the same job twice.  This seems like a general problem uneven distributions are pretty common.p

Negative 84917 pI have a question regarding hidinging interface details in C libraries.

Negative 84917 pI have 5 span elements that I am trying to fade in and out on top of an image. The following code works fine if I have no child html elements included in the span tag, but if I add p tags around some of the elements, it doesnt work. The reason I am adding p tags is I would like the text stacked on top of each other instead of inline so it fits in the area I am trying to display on. p  pHow can I make the jQuery work again now that I have added the p tagsp  pstrongEDITstrong To clarify, I only want one span to show at a time. On page load, first span shows, then when it fades out, the second span shows up, and so on.

Negative 84917 pI have to develop an application that will be required to measure user response time within a series of experiments.

With that said, now that Ive read about the accuracy of timers in browsers, specifically javascript timers, Im learning there can be a delay from a few milliseconds to upwards of 1015ms.

Negative 84917 pTrying get opacity to toggle. Basically the list items are set at zero opacity, thereby retaining their height. When the list subcategory head is clicked, the empty list area drops down ot the depth of the list items and then opacity should toggle to reveal list elements. On clicking the subcategory list head again, the list items opacity is faded back to zero and then the list area collapses. Need to keep the list items there for their, hence the opacity method rather than hide, hideToggle or similar functions where they are removed from the DOM. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethotdiggityzn6cz10 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethotdiggityzn6cz10ap  precode  ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt   lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt   ltheadgt   ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt   lttitlegtjQuery Toggle Opacitylttitlegt     ltscript typetext srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.8.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt   ltheadgt    ltbodygt   ltul classlistgt       ltligtlta hrefgtSubcategoryltagtltligt       ltli idid1 classexpandablegtlta hrefgtSubcategory  Click this oneltagt         ltulgt               ltligtSub menu item 1ltligt               ltligtSub menu item 2ltligt               ltligtSub menu item 3ltligt               ltligtSub menu item 4ltligt               ltligtSub menu item 5ltligt               ltligtSub menu item 6ltligt          ltulgtltligt           ltligtlta hrefgtSubcategoryltagtltligt           ltligtlta hrefgtSubcategoryltagtltligt       ltulgt   ltbodygt   lthtmlgt codepre  pJQuery...p  precodedocument.readyfunction     .list li.expandable ul.hide     .list li.expandable ul li.css opacity 0      .expandable.clickfunction         id1.expandable ul.slideToggleslow       this.toggleClasstogglearrow         this.togglefunction              .list li.expandable ul li.stop             .list li.expandable ul li.fadeTo2000,1             return false               ,         function              .list li.expandable ul li.stop             .list li.expandable ul li.fadeTo2000,0.delay500             return false                    return false       codepre  pCurrently the opacity toggle is malfunctioning with flickering on and off.p

O3 turns on all optimizations           specified   by   O2   and   also   turns  on  the           finlinefunctions and frenameregisters options. codepre blockquote  pAnd Ive also confirmed the code to make sure that two options is the only two optimizations included with O3 onp  precodeif optimize gt 3     flaginlinefunctions  1     flagrenameregisters  1  codepre  pFor those two optimizationsp  pstrongfinlinefunctionsstrong is useful in some cases mainly with C because it lets us define the size of inlined functions 600 by default with finlinelimit. Compiler may report an error complaining about lack of memory when set a high inlinelimit. p  pstrongfrenameregistersstrong attempts to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use of registers left over after register allocation. This optimization will most benefit processors with lots of registers. p  pFor inlinefunctions, although it can reduce the numbers of function calls, but it may lead to a large binary files, so finlinefunctions may introduce severe cache penalties and become even slower than O2. I think the cache penalties not only depends on the program itself. p  pFor renameregisters, I dont think it will have any positive impact on a cisc architecture like x86.p  pMy question has 2.5 part p  p[Answerd]1. Am I right to claim that whether a program can run faster with O3 option depends on the underlying platformarchitecturep  pEDIT The 1st part has been confirmed as true. David Hammen also claim that we should be very careful with regard to how optimization and floating point operations interact on machines with extended precision floating point registers like Intel and AMD.p  p2.strongWhen can I confidently use O3 optionstrong I suppose these two optimizations especially the renameregisters may lead to a different behaviors from O0O2. I saw some programs compiled with O3 got crashed during execution, is it deterministic If I run an executable once without any crash, does it mean it is safe to use O3p  pEDIT The deterministicity has nothing to do with the optimization, it is a multithreading problem. However, for a multithread program, it is not safe to use O3 when we run an executable once without errors. David Hammen shows that O3 optimization on floating point operations may violate the strict weak ordering criterion for a comparison. strongIs there any other concern we need to take care when we want to use O3 optionstrongp  p[Answered]3. If the answer of the 1st question is yes, then when I change the target platform or in a distributed system with different machines, I may need to change between O3 and O2. Is there any general ways to decide whether I can get a performance improvement with O3 For example, more registers, short inline functions, etc.p  pEDIT The 3rd part has been answered by Louen as the variety of platforms make general reasoning about this problem impossible When evaluating the performance gain by O3, we have to try it with both and benchmark our code to see which is faster.p

Negative 84917 pSo Ive been searching for the answer to this over the past couple days.  This has been my first foray into cookies, so I hope this will be an easy one for you guys.  I have a website that asks the user if they want to use the mobile version of the site and stores their response in a cookie so that next time they visit, theyre automatically taken to their preferred version.  On the mobile site however, I provide a link back to desktop.html on the desktop site which resets their preference to the desktop version of the site and then loads the corresponding desktop version of the page they were on on the mobile site.  Thats all well amp good but I quickly discovered that the cookie plan was not working.  The user would automatically be redirected back to the mobile site.  I discovered that this is because desktop.html was at the root level of the site and all the other pages were in subdirectories.  So I read that you can make cookies global by appending path to the cookie.  I did that to all my pages.  However, I kept getting bounced back to the mobile site despite emptying my cookies from the browser and starting afresh and I even kept getting asked for my preference each time I went to the desktop site despite setting a cookie each time, so I decided to check the cookie value by putting it in an alert in the pages in the subdirectories and each time any of the pages in the subdirectories are loaded, the cookie has been nullempty.  If I remove path, then the cookies I access have the values Id set on a previous page load and everything works except for the explicit reset in desktop.html.  I figure I must not be accessing the global cookie Id previously set.  All the pages Id found say to set a global cookie using that path string, but none of the pages Ive been able to find seem to tell me how to access it on subsequent page loads  or Im just too much of a noob to realize Im doing something wrong.p  pHeres the code in desktop.htmlp  precode  ltbody stylebackground rgb165, 183, 156 margin 0pt onloaddocument.cookie  desktop pathalertPreference saved.

Negative 84917 pI run into a problem. Following OWASP cheatsheet, I implemented a onetimeuse CSRF token system in PHP basically copyamppaste from OWASP. Each form or link link that generate some action will create its own CSRF token, once its used, it will be deleted. Application is a website, so multiples tabs could be opened at the same time. p  pThe problem is that each time it load a page, it create a new CSRF token even if you just hit reload and not send the form. For example, in the admin panel, theres a list of the items, each item could be deleted with a link which have a CSRF token same CSRF token for all links, but if you reload the page, a new csrf is generated.p  pAt the end of the day, I ended with more unused tokens than I wanted to. This is a problem in certain servers.p  pTLDR I generate a token per request. I deleted all used token except for ajax request tokens, that after an hour I delete then. My problem is with UNUSED tokens, at the end of the day, therere too many of them.p

Negative 84917 pIm having some weird memory issues in a C program Im writing, and I think something related to my texture loading system is the cause.p  pThe problem is that, depending on how many textures I make, different issues start coming up.

Negative 84917 pIve recently been toying around with a hrefhttpbeneverard.github.iojqPagination relnofollowjqPaginationa, which is a jQuery plugin for pagination. Its a really neat plugin and I love how you can type in the page number. However, Im having some difficulty because there isnt much documentation on it. Although this is probably a simple question, I was just curious as to if there was a way to specify how many records would be displayed per page. I currently have pagination working for one record per page, and thats controlled by jQuery selectors. Id like to be able to specify how many numbers, however. p  pIt might be simpler to show some of the code that I have. I actually used a previous stack overflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11362445howtousejqpaginationquestiona as a basis p  precodeltdiv idcontainergt     ltdiv iddiv1gtAny elementsltdivgt     ltdiv iddiv2gtAny elementsltdivgt     ltdiv iddiv3gtAny elementsltdivgt     ... and so on ltdivgt codepre  pAnd for the jQuery p  precodeHide  container.children.notfirstDiv.hide  .pagination.jqPagination      maxpage     container.children.length,     paged         functionpage           hide the other divs         container.children.hide          show the divs on the specified page         container.children[page  1].show codepre  pSo the code above will only display one div at a time, I would like to specify how many elementsdivs it can show. p  pOh, and as a follow up question, is it possible to specify a certain div to appear on a certain page, e.g. having the footer only appear on the last page p  pstrongUpdate Completedstrongp  pWith the help of the creator I was able to figure it out. Im posting my solution below in case in could help anyone else out in the future. Im having the user select the number of records per page in an XML file didnt include XML selector.

Negative 84917 pIm studying multithreading and trying to understand the concept of strongsemaphoresstrong and strongmutual exclusionstrong.

Negative 84917 pI have a large database script migrating multiple databases of the same structure to one destination database. This destination database is more generic so it is able to store the data from the different source databases. I use a variable to keep track of the current Entity being migrated so I know what ID to insert in the destination table. p  pAt this moment the migration performance is really bad. To be able to profile the script better Id like to split up the script by placing go after each table migration but this destroys the variable. Is there a way to declare a variable that is accessible for the whole connectionsession Just like a temp table isp

Negative 84917 pim writing a wcf service to handle large files, ive followed the rules explained on msdn and found around on web. The service download method returns a stream and calls a business logic object which searches for documents into an ecm . the ecm api raises an exception when there arent matching documents and the bl object returns a null stream. The server side code executes without exceptions, but when the response reaches the client i got a System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException  The underlying connection was closed The connection was closed unexpectedly .  Ive searched the web and all problems related to that exception refer to excessive size of returned values , while im having the opposite problem. My question is theres a specific way to handle null return streams  Is something related to the service or client configuration  at the moment im returning an empty stream , but it doesnt look a smart solution .

Negative 84917 pI am trying to make a search engine for my website. How should I design  the table which keeps the list of indexed words.p  pEarlier I thought something like thisp  pTable codetblindexedwordscode has 2 columns codeiwwordidcode and codeiwwordcode.p  pTable codetblwordoccurrencecode has 4 columns codewooccurrenceidcode, codewowordidcode, codewopageidcode, codewonumberofoccurrencescode.p  pNow, this design will not work well if the user enters more than two words in the search box. Suppose codefoo barcode. Even if codefoocode and codebarcode both are present in the table codetblindexedwordscode and corresponding details are in the codetblwordoccurrencecode, my search engine script would rank the results where it sees maximum codewonumberofoccurrencescode for either codefoocode or codebarcode. It will not see whether codefoocode and codebarcode are present next to each other as  there is no column for order of occurrence of the words. I hope I am clear with what I am saying here.p  pAnother idea could be to make the table codetblwordoccurrencecode of 3 columns. Forget about codewonumberofoccurencescode and store each word in the page with unique codewooccurrenceidcode. Now, this would solve my problem as I know the order of occurrence of the words. if  codewooccurrenceidcode of some word is codewooccurrenceidcode1 or codewooccurrenceidcode1 of some other word then, these two occur side by side.p  pThe problem with this design is that it would take up lots of space. I have lots of content for my website.  I think this approach would make it slownot sure, though. Is there any other design that would help me Or will I have to go with the second one I am sure the first one is not gonna work, so discarding it.p

Negative 84917 pI am trying to develop a solution in CRM 2011 from VS 2010. When it works its sort of OK well CRM is a dog but the code works. But every so often it throws its toys out of the pram and refuses to debug. The current problem I have is that it protests that The common language runtime was unable to set the breakpoint on some lines in my routines. For examplep  precodeprivate static TimeSpan FindWorkTimeDateTime T1, DateTime T2, Boolean[, ,] supporthours      TimeSpan SlotDuration  new TimeSpan0, 30, 0     TimeSpan fwt  new TimeSpan0  This I can put a break point on     if T2 gt T1                     This tells me the CLR can not set a breakpoint              DateTime T1S  servicecase.FindTimeSlotStartT1         DateTime T2S  servicecase.FindTimeSlotStartT2 codepre  pThe code is not optimised. Breakpoints where studio or CLR or whatever it is thats getting upset decides to actually recognise them work.

When the declaration is parsed those dummies get replaced by their real symbols. After the parsing we can check if there are dummies left and if so output an error.pli lipDont do any symbol stuff while parsing but only create the AST. After parsing step through the AST and depending on the node add symbols. For e.g. a class node add symbols of the children and process them after. For e.g. statement blocks step through children and add symbols immediatly before the child is processed.pli ol  pI would expect approach 1. is easier and also more useful for stuff like importing other compilation units. p  pEditbr A problem i see with approach 1 is that there needs some kind of handling for ordered symbols. E.g. withing a function its not possible to use a local symbol before it is used.p

Negative 84917 pIm new to this world and I need to understand some of the concepts of Backbone and Marionette. Here Im trying to explain some of the concepts Im learning. It would be great to having some feedback on them.p  pThe coderendercode function defines the logic for rendering a template. When it is finished, the codeonRendercode callback is called. Here I suppose the rendered view has been not attached to the DOM. It is composed by a codetagNamecode the default is codedivcode that contains the template I attached to it. To explicitly insert that tag into the DOM I need to append it somewhere. Am I wrongp  pIn general, I do the following.p  precodevar view  new MyView view.render container.appendview.el codepre  pMarionette extends Backbone with the concept of regions. The codeshowcode method can be called on a region to present a specific view.p  precodevar view  new MyView region.showview codepre  pIn this case, the codeshowcode method will be call the coderendercode function on its own and finally, when the content of the view will be put in the DOM, the codeonShowcode is called on that view. Is it okp  pFrom Marionette doc there is also another callback called codeonDomRefreshcode. From my experiments, Ive noticed that this method is called before codeonShowcode. So, my supposition is that the view has not been attached to the DOM yet. But the doc says the following.p  blockquote   pTriggered after the view has been rendered, has been shown in the DOM   via a Marionette.Region, and has been rerendered.p blockquote  pCould you give some hints on itp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 84917 pIts a bit complex so bear with me. Ive got three layers of directivesp  ol liTop layer  a popup directiveli liMiddle layer  a codeswitchpanecode directive li liBottom layer  one of several viewsli ol  pThe top layer is just some popup that represents a wizard in my app. The middle layer is a directive Ive made that acts as a stack of views  you can push and pop views. The top view is displayed and the rest are pushed aside and blurred. The bottom layer is a bunch of views that are normally unrelated to each other, which are dynamically loaded and displayed in the codeswitchpanecode according to what the user does.p  pSo far, this works, BUT currently, the top layers codescopecode has an array property that represents all the views the codeswitchpanecode should display, passed to the codeswitchpanecode directive as an attribute, and the codeswitchpanecode directives codewatchcodees it and updates itself. This is OK but I dont think its good enough  Id like the codeswitchpanecode directive itself to manage its stack of views, and only expose a codepushcode and codepopcode API.p  pHere are a few ways I thought ofp  ul liUsing codebroadcastcode  codeemitcode  the top layer will broadcast a push event and the codeswitchpanecode will catch it and do whatever it needsli liUsing a service to subscribe and fire the push event  this is just like using codebroadcastcode but doesnt propagate throughout the scope treeli liUsing a service that allows the codeswitchpanecode directive to register an API of its own. Using some way of identifying it such as an attribute or even element IDli liUsing codeangular.element.scopecode to get access to the codeswitchpanecodes inner workingsli ul  pFrankly, I dont like any of these methods much. Certainly I want to avoid being tied to the DOM, so the last 2 are worst.p  pAny other ways to do this Which is the most Angularish way to expose a directives API, considering we dont really have access to a strongcertain instancestrong of a directive except via DOMp
Negative 84917 pI know about creating unique index. But My problem is bit different. I want uniqueness check for different states for the same column.p  pFor example. Table contains column MoneyTransferstatus, now it can be pending, inprogress, approved, rejected etc.p  pNow for a given user if there is an inprogress or pending status I do not want to add new money transfer for the user, else it should be okay.p  pIs there some way in DB I can specify thisp

Negative 84917 pIm using the Ruby gem a hrefhttprubygems.orggemsrestclient relnofollowrestclienta 1.6.7 to retrieve data using HTTP GET requests.  However, sometimes the responses are bigger than I want to handle, so I would like some way to have the codeRestClientcode stop reading once it exceeds a size limit I set. The a hrefhttprubydoc.infogemsrestclient1.6.7frames relnofollowdocumentationa saysp  blockquote   pFor cases not covered by the general API, you can use the RestClientRequest class which provide a lowerlevel API.p blockquote  pbut I do not see how that helps me.  I do not see anything that looks like a hook into processing the incoming data stream, only operations I could perform after the whole thing is read.  I dont want to waste time and memory reading a huge response into a buffer only to discard it.p  pHow can I set a limit on the amount of data read by codeRestClientcode in a codeGETcode request  Or is there a different client I can use that makes it easy to set such a limitp

Negative 84917 pSo heres my problemp  pCurrently Im developing a primitive light system for a game. The stage is overlayed with a black mask to represent darkness, its alpha is then adjusted from 0 brightest, invisible to 1 total darkness, opaque. As the hero gets closer to a light, I subtract the total amount of absorbed light from 1. To create a zone of light around each light, with more light coming the closer the hero is, I used a quadratic expression that takes the distance as the independent variable.p  pMy code looks like thisp  precode            var boostNumber  0         var exponentNumber  1.1Lists.Lights.length         for var iiint  0 ii lt Lists.Lights.length ii              var distNumber  Lists.Lights[ii].getDistance100             var addMeNumber  Math.powdist, exponent  Math.powdist, exponent  2  1             ifaddMegt0             boost  addMe                               traceboost         var bNumber  brightness  boost codepre  pThe problem is adjusting the exponent for the number of lights. Currently the more lights, the more severe the adjustments are. More lights  lights with shorter range. This is because all the lights are cancelling each other out, with distant lights having little to no effect.p  pSo, should I try to restructure my code to use a different method or is there something Im not seeing herep

Negative 84917 pI am currently writing some code for a sample sequencer in Android. I am using the AudioTrack class. I have been told the only proper way to have accurate timing is to use the timing of the AudioTrack. EG I know that if I write a buffer of X samples to AudioTrack playing at a rate of 44100 samples per second, that the time to write will be 144100X secs.p  pThen you use that info to know what samples should be written when.p  pI am trying to implement my first attempt using this approach. I am using only one sample and am writing it as continuous 16th notes at a tempo of 120bpm. But for some reason it is playing at a rate of 240bpm.p  pFirst I checked my code to derive the time of a 16th nanoseconds note at tempo X. It checks outs.p  precodeprivate void setPeriod      periodint1doubleTEMPO601000     periodperiod10000004     Log.itest,String.valueOfperiod  codepre  pThen I verified that my code to get the time for my buffer to be played at 44100khz in nanoseconds and it is correct.p  precodelong bufferTime1000000000SAMPLERATEbuffSize codepre  pSo now I am left thinking that the audio track is playing at a rate that is different from 44100. Maybe 96000khz, which would explain the doubling of speed. But when I instantiate the  audioTrack, it was indeed set to 44100khz.p  pfinal int SAMPLERATE is set to 44100p  precodebuffSize  AudioTrack.getMinBufferSizeSAMPLERATE, AudioFormat.CHANNELOUTMONO,              AudioFormat.ENCODINGPCM16BIT     track  new AudioTrackAudioManager.STREAMMUSIC, SAMPLERATE,              AudioFormat.CHANNELOUTMONO,              AudioFormat.ENCODINGPCM16BIT,              buffSize,              AudioTrack.MODESTREAM codepre  pSo I am confused as to why my tempo is being doubled. I ran a debug to compare time elapsed audioTrack to time elapsed system time, and the it seems that the audiotrack is indeed playing twice as fast as it should be.

If I remove the jar I cant call any functions at all through jni. When I set it again it all works fine. Is it intended functionality that I need the compiled sources and the bunbled jars  with dependency jars toop  pEdit Thank you for your responses. Allow me to clarify some of the popped up questions in one place. So, the Java Project has the following structure within Netbeans 7.4p  precodeCore  Source Packages   core    Core.java   model    model.java  Test Packages  Libraries   enttoolkit.jar   mail.jar   wmisclient.jar codepre  pAs you can see I have three dependencies as external jar files. Whether I like it or not sadly, the java app uses these. After compilation the following structure appears in the dist folder of the projectp  precodelib  enttoolkit.jar  mail.jar  wmisclient.jar Core.jar  core   core.class  METAINF   MANIFEST.MF  model   model.class codepre  pI have the Core.jar with the compiled classes inside and a lib folder with the external jar files in it.p  pNow to the actual problematic part. If I remove either the .class or .jar file from the classpath in CreateVM function later on envFindclass fails. It just wont find the any classes, where if I provide both the class files and the jar files it succeeds and I can call any method from the class, static or not.p  pMANIFEST.MF contentsp  precodeManifestVersion 1.0 AntVersion Apache Ant 1.9.1 CreatedBy 1.7.025b17 Oracle Corporation ClassPath libenttoolkit.jar libmail.jar libwmisclient.jar XCOMMENT MainClass will be added automatically by build MainClass core.Core codepre  pEdit 1030 The error is NoClassDefFoundError. The value of compiledSource is the path to the .class file including the class file itself while the jar is the same with the jar file. for examplep  precodeDjava.class.pathCUsersjohorvatAppDataLocalTempresource.class lt The upper NoClassDefFoundError Djava.class.pathCUsersjohorvatAppDataLocalTempresource.classCUsersjohorvatAppDataLocalTempresource.jar lt Works flawlessly without any errors and produces Java method return values on C side. codepre  pThe same happens if I leave out the class file and use the only the jar. It only works if I have both of them, or get the NoClassDefFoundError. Kind of strange for me...p

Negative 84917 pI am spawning 12 sprites to place in a game.  Each sprite needs to have an original name.  I am doing this by using a for loop.  I have split the loop up to show you what is happening.  So for the first couple of chargesp  precodefor int i  4 i lt 0 i              NSLogi  i, i         [self spawnChargesWithNumberi]      codepre  pThe NSLog tells me that i is 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.  As it should.  This calls the method codespawnChargesWithNumbericode which looks like thisp  precode voidspawnChargesWithNumberintnumber  NSLognumber is i, number  chargedBall  [[ChargedBall alloc] initWithImageNamed[NSString stringWithFormatChargedBalli, number]]  code to make a random position  chargedBall.position  CGPointMakeactualX, random chargedBall.name  [NSString stringWithFormatchargeNumberi, number] chargedBall.zPosition  15 chargedBall.physicsBody  [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithCircleOfRadius13.0f] chargedBall.physicsBody.dynamic  YES chargedBall.physicsBody.affectedByGravity  NO chargedBall.physicsBody.mass  0.1 chargedBall.velocity  CGPointMakeactualVelocityX, 0.0 chargedBall.physicsBody.categoryBitMask  chargeCategory chargedBall.physicsBody.contactTestBitMask  playerCategory chargedBall.physicsBody.collisionBitMask  playerCategory  selfCategory [self.map addChildchargedBall]  NSLogYou made charge with name , chargedBall.name  if enemies      enemies  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]   [enemies addObjectchargedBall] NSLogyou added  to the array, chargedBall.name  codepre  pI have an object called codeChargedBallcode. The codeNSLogcode first tells me the number, which corresponds to codeicode from above.  Then it tells me I made charge chargeNumberi where it follows the same pattern.  Then I add that codechargedBallcode to an array.  During the game if I collide with any of these, my codeNSLogcode from codedidBeginContactcode method tells me that I have contacted the proper charge.  All is working as planned.p  pSince I actually have 12 charges and not 5 I have another codeforcode loop to show you.  It is basically the same taking off where the other endedp  precodefor int i  1 i lt 7 i              NSLogi  i, i         [self spawnChargesWithNumberi]      codepre  pI did originally have these together, but I wanted to show you what was happening.  After the call to codespawnChargesWithNumbericode I get the rest of the charges.  However, they are reversed  I dont get it.  The codeNSLogcode still tells me the codeicode, number, you created codechargeNumbericode, and added it to the array.  I even codeNSLogcode the name of the image and it still corresponds.  But codechargeNumber7code shows picture 1, codechargeNumber6codeshows picture 2, codechargeNumber 5code shows picture 3, four is fine because there is an odd number of sprites to make, codechargeNumber3code show picture 5, codechargeNumber2code shows picture6 and codechargeNumber 7code shows picture 1.  So the entire thing is flipped.  I have checked the pictures and they are all correct.  This even happened when I had the codeforcode loop as just one loop, the positive charges were switched, but not zero to negative 4.  Does anyone know why this would happen  I codeNSLogcode everything I could think of, I even changed the picture names, but nothing worked.  If you need some more code from other places I can post, I am just so confused right nowp

Problem is that I am a newbie and cannot quite figure out how to implement the use of ajax in this situation.p  pHere is my code that displays the resultsp  precode  ltdoctype htmlgt   lthtml langengt   ltheadgt   ltmeta charsetutf8gt   lttitlegtjQuery UI Dialog  Default functionalitylttitlegt   ltlink relstylesheet hrefwhosgotbooks.comjqueryjqueryui1.10.4.custom.cssgt   ltscript srcwhosgotbooks.comjqueryjquery1.10.2.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript srcwhosgotbooks.comjqueryjqueryui1.10.4.custom.jsgtltscriptgt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt   ltdiv iddialog titleGoogle Books Search Results styledisplaynonegt   ltscriptgt   function     dialog .dialog     height 550, width 450     returnvalues .clickfunction     dialog .dialog close             ltscriptgt              ltstronggtltp stylefontsize 16px textalign centergtTop 10 Results for ampquotltphp echo POST[q] gtampquotltpgtltstronggt      ltstronggtltp stylefontsize 14px textalign centergtchoose a book to select as your topicltpgtltstronggtampnbsp     lttable stylewidth400pxgt     ltcol width325gt     ltcol width75gt         ltphp foreach data[items] as item  gt                   lttrgt         lttdgt                    ltstronggtltugtltdiv stylefontsize 14pxgtltphp printfitem[volumeInfo][title]gtltugtltdivgtltstronggt                      ltstronggtAuthor ltstronggtltphp printf item[volumeInfo][authors][0]gtltbr gt                      ltstronggtPublished ltstronggtltphp printf item[volumeInfo][publishedDate] gtltbr gt                                   ltstronggtPages ltstronggtltphp printf item[volumeInfo][pageCount] gtltbr gt                      ltstronggtPublisher ltstronggtltphp printf item[volumeInfo][publisher] gtltbr gt                      ltstronggtCategory ltstronggtltphp printf strtoloweritem[volumeInfo][printType]., .strtoloweritem[volumeInfo][categories][0] gtampnbspampnbsp            ltstronggtISBN ltstronggtltphp printf item[volumeInfo][industryIdentifiers][0][identifier] gtlttdgt         lttdgtltpgtltinput typesubmit nameselect valueSelect idreturnvaluesgtltpgt             ltimg srcltphp printf rawurldecodeitem[volumeInfo][imageLinks][smallThumbnail] gt gt                 lttdgt         lttrgtlttd stylewidth420pxgtltpgtltstronggtDescription ltstronggtltphp printf item[volumeInfo][description] gtltbr gtltpgtlttdgt                    lttrgt         lttrgt          ltphp           else              gt                ltpgtltstronggtSorry, there were no resultsltstronggtltpgt             ltphp             for testing purposes show actual request to API  REMOVE when finished         apiRequest  url         echo ltpgtAPI request .apiRequest.ltpgt  gt     lttablegt   ltdivgt   ltbodygt   lthtmlgt        ltphp       else show form and allow the user to check for Google Book search results       gt    ltpgtltform idsearchForm namesearchForm methodpostgt      ltfieldset idsearchBoxgt         ltlabelgtSearch for a Bookltlabelgt         ltinput classtext idq nameq typetext valuePowered by Google onfocusthis.value this.onfocusnull gt         ltselect idtype nametype size1gt             ltoption selected valueallgtBook Titleltoptiongt             ltoption valueisbngtBooks by ISBNltoptiongt             ltoption valuelccngtBooks by LCCN ltoptiongt             ltoption valueoclcgtBooks by OCLC ltoptiongt                         ltselectgt         ltinput classsubmit idsubmit namesubmit typesubmit valueSearch  gt     ltfieldsetgt   ltformgtltpgt codepre  pDo I need to create a separate file for the ajax portion, then call this file If so, I will need help on how to implement that.p  pJust in case someone needs to see more, here is all my codep  precodefunction booksearchgoogle         set API version for Google Book Search API   v  issetPOST[v]  POST[v]  1   set user API key for Google Book Search API   key  issetPOST[key]  POST[key]     set user IP for Google Book Search API   ip  issetPOST[ip]  POST[ip]  SERVER[REMOTEADDR]   set default value for query to Google Book Search API 0307387941   query  issetPOST[q]  POST[q]  0307387941   set default value for search type to Google Book Search API   type  issetPOST[type]  POST[type]  all   check and assign page of search results  are we on the first page   start  issetPOST[start]  POST[start]  1   set default value for number of results   limit  issetPOST[limit]  POST[limit]  10    switch type       case all       params  q.urlencodequery.ampstartIndex.start.ampmaxResults.limit     break      case isbn             params  qisbn.urlencodequery.     break      case lccn             params qlccn.urlencodequery.     break      case oclc             params  qoclc.urlencodequery.     break      default       echo ltpgtYou must specify a search type such as all or book.

Negative 84917 pIm using the default Grid app template and I had a question that I have not found a good answer to yet.p  pIf you just use the sample data and remove all the data elements from a grouping, is there any way to show an item template that just says No items easilyp  pThe group header is still present which is fine, just would be helpful to have an indicator there is no data present in the items list.p  pI tried a DataTemplateSelector but it isnt used if no items are present. Its a little baffling how something like a ListView or GridView doesnt have an EmptyDataTemplatep  pstrongEditstrong The reason Im asking about this particular scenario is that this application is showing employees grouped by companies. If you add a new company, I would still like the companys name to show, and if you click on the Header of the group, you could still see information about the company, even if no employees have been assigned. p  pTherefore my group headings should still be visible to navigate into, even if no employees items are assigned. I would like an item directly underneath the group header to say something like No employees present but still leave the company information visible.p  pSo for instancep  pCompany 1 p  ul liEmployee 1li liEmployee 2li liEmployee 3li ul  pCompany 2  p  ul liNo employees present li ul  pClicking Company 2 would still show you information about that company on the GroupDetails page.p

Negative 84917 pI am developing an strongandroidstrong app that allows users to create notes and save the notes in the android strongsq lite databasestrong. p  ul liThe notes can contain elements I call strongUIstrong elements, and each UI element has a corresponding table in the database and is linked to the codenotecode table using the foreign key of the saved note.li lipWhenever the user saves a note, I save the note with all its elements in their appropriate tables.The user may choose to continue editing after a save action is performed.p  pNow, when the user tries to save again, I am presented with two options. p  ol liDelete the note record and related records UI elements from the database and save the note again codereinsertcode.

Negative 84917 pI am deleting a large amount of data from the a large Oracle database. The process I have followed is that I delete a record table A with causes CASCADE delete on table B which has CASCADE delete on some other table. So basically there are several tables related with each other with CASCADE delete. p  pCurrently this process works in iteration for a number of records in table A and I only COMMIT at the very end of the iteration when all data is deleted. The process takes around 30 hours to complete. p  pI have been suggested to have regular COMMIT, i.e. a COMMIT for each record deletion for table A including deletion on any subsequent records in child tables.p  pI know that regular commit will keep the undo log size low but is there any performance improvement with regular commits Would I see an improvement in the time it takes to complete the scriptp

Negative 84917 pIve written up a large collection of abstract data types ie hash tables, heaps, etc and simple algorithms ie search, sort, list manipulation, etc that all work on arrays of codeintcode.

Im trying to accomplish something likep  precodesomeRandomDataType tempArray  someRandomDataTypeinputArray codepre  pHowever, I cant find any means of doing this at run time without the use of macros which Id like to avoid in this case if possible.

Negative 84917 pWe are in the process of migrating media items images, PDFs, etc from an old system into Sitecore. Some of the directories in the old system have multiple media items with the same name but different extensions. So if I had to get them via URL they would be as follows p  ul lihttpexample.comimagestest.gifli lihttpexample.comimagestest.jpgli ul  pThey can obviously be reached in the old file based system because their file extensions differ. In Sitecore, out of the box, this is not the case. Multiple items that live under the same node with the same name cannot be reached by adding extensions in front of them. Only the first media item would be hit regardless of the extensions.p  pIs there a way to get around this Can Sitecore differentiate between different media items with the same name but different extensions under the same node so that the above 2 URLs would work and point to the respective imagesp  pThanksp

Negative 84917 pIve been trying to implement a formula for some reporting in a Sybase 15.7 SQL query, I was getting some strange results so I tried breaking down the query and running it as single selects.p  precodeselect 18.012 codepre  pResult strong1.66667strongp  pAll as expected so farp  precodeselect power18.012, 1 codepre  pResult strong1.66667strongp  pStill fine it also works for an integer raised to an integer powerp  precodeselect power18.012, 2 codepre  pEmpty result set....p  pWhy does the power function fail in this casep  pChecking the logs Im getting a warning saying truncation error occurred which I assume means it doesnt have enough precision to handle the result of the power function. However I cant find anything online about how to handle that error or make it give me the best approximation it can of the result...p  pHow do I calculate power18.012, 60 in Sybase The eventual formula needs the exponent to be 60 or even higher, but Sybase falls over with the exponent just being 2p

Is it allowed p  pMy app will go to Apple app store hence I am looking for acceptable approach. Your experience will help me a lot. p  pSomewhere i read that if your app registered for VOIP in background modes then you can create a socket and can capture the data. But I am not sure if this way works or can be acceptable by Apple App Store.p

Negative 84917 pIm currently working on a project thats using .NET MVC on the back end and Backbone v1.1 with Marionette JS v1.8.5 on the front end and I am experiencing some performance issues when trying to render a Composite view with 200 results or item views.p  pI first came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22198924backbonemarionettecompositeviewrenderingthis SO post of a similar issuea which helped me get a newer version of marionette v1.8.5.p  pHandlebars templates are being used to show a html table with each itemView being wrapped in a tbody this has a more complex accordion view within it hence tbody being used rather than a more semantic trp  pThe Composite view is being initialised and shown in a Marionette region when its sub app is initialised.p  pHeres a simplified version of my code.p  pstrongActivities sub appstrongp  precodeuse strict  App.moduleActivities, function     this.startWithParent  false   App.addRegions     RegionActivities regionActivities  lt this lives in .NET View of project   App.Activities.addInitializerfunction options       var module  this,         activities  new Collections.Activities      module.activitiesView  new Views.ActivitiesView         collection activities           App.RegionActivities.showmodule.activitiesView      activities.fetch   codepre  pstrongActivities Composite Viewstrongp  precodeuse strict  Views.ActivitiesView  Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend      template Handlebars.templates[activitiesactivities],      itemView Views.ActivityView,      itemViewContainer .admintableactivities,  lt html table that items are appended to   codepre  pstrongActivities Item Viewstrongp  precodeuse strict  Views.ActivityView  Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend      template Handlebars.templates[activitiesactivity],      tagName tbody   codepre  pI read the a hrefhttpsgithub.commarionettejsbackbone.marionetteblobmasterdocsmarionette.collectionview.mdcollectionviewsattachhtml relnofollowMarionette Docs on the better performing doc fragmentap  pSo the performance issue that Im having is that all 200 items are being appended one at a time and not utilising docFragment buffer. Through debugging I believe this is because the view is being instantiated with an empty Activities collection before the fetch, so Marionette thinks Im updating the collection and sets the isBuffering to false.p  pIve also tried instatiating the activitiesView inside the fetch success callback like sop  precodeactivities.fetch     success functionnewCollection          module.activitiesView  new Views.ActivitiesView             collection newCollection                   App.RegionActivities.showmodule.activitiesView       codepre  pThis does append the 200 items to the collections elBuffer takes about 4 seconds but then takes another 50 seconds or so before anything is shown on screen. Debugging suggests the onShow method thats triggered by the collection could be causing this delay as it loop through each item one by one.p  pHave I missed somethingp  pAm I doing everything in the right placesp  pIs what Im trying to achieve even possiblep  pSeems strange to me that this could be so difficult.p  pThanks for you time.

Negative 84917 pIve just installed Xmonad as my windows manager for Linux Mint 16. Its working fine except for one thing, there is no visible output when using terminal.p  pFor example if I launch Firefox via terminal, the program loads up fine. However there is no output in terminal to show I have done this. Its as if the terminal output is being written in black rather than white.p  pAnother example to more clearly illustrate my point, if I press the up arrow key, none of my previous executed input is shown.p  pI havent touched any config files, its a clean install of Xmonad.p  pAny help would be appreciated. Again ive tried searching for the issue on Google but couldnt find anything.p

Negative 84917 pIm trying to call a COM Interface using Python Script.p  pI got the installation of Python from ActivePython, and Im trying to script parts of my code using the Script Engine. This normally works with VBScript and JScript, but now I want to extend this with PythonScript.p  pThe Script Engine is called through a COM interface that I have defined. It seems that most things works, but when I call a method with both a Set and Get defined, Python fails to locate the correct version of the method.p  pIn my ODL file I have defined a method called Property, which has a propget and propput flag, with the same name and id, like thisp  precode[propget,id100] HRESULT Property[in]BSTR name,[out,retval]VARIANT val [propput,id100] HRESULT Property[in]BSTR name,[in]VARIANT val codepre  pWhen called from JScript I can do like thisp  precodeSession.PropertyTest,2 codepre  pIn the Scripting Engine oledisp1.cpp in COleDispatchImplInvoke line 1309, this call is interpret as a DISPATCHMETHOD method, and then corrected to DISPATCHPROPERTYPUTREF, based on a test on the arguments in this part of the codep  precode treat member calls on properties just like property getset if wFlags  DISPATCHMETHOD ampamp     pEntrygtpfn  NULL ampamp pEntrygtpfnSet  NULL       pEntrygtpfn  NULL ampamp pEntrygtpfnSet  NULL       pEntrygtpfn  NULL ampamp pEntrygtpfnSet  NULL       the entry describes a property but a method call is being       attempted  change it to a property getset based on the       number of parameters being passed.     wFlags amp DISPATCHMETHOD     UINT nExpectedArgs  pEntrygtlpszParams  NULL          UINTlstrlenApEntrygtlpszParams  0     if pDispParamsgtcArgs lt nExpectedArgs               no extra param  so treat as property get         wFlags  DISPATCHPROPERTYGET          else               extra params  treat as property set         wFlags  DISPATCHPROPERTYPUTREF         pDispParamsgtcNamedArgs  1       codepre  pWhen the same method is called from Python, the COleDispatchImplInvoke is initially called with the flag DISPATCHPROPERTYGET.p  pThis is of cause wrong, since the call must be interpret as a DISPATCHPROPERTYPUTREF, then the method call fails with wrong number of arguments.p  pWhy are Python Script misinterpreting this method callp  pIs Python Script not able to handle propget and propput methods as defined in the OLD filep  pCan I in the call to the method in Python Script somehow tell that it is the propput version of the method I want to callp  hr  h3Update 1h3  pThe above code calls the following macrop  precodeDISPPROPERTYPARAMIDCMyScriptingObject,Property,100,GetProperty,SetProperty,VTVARIANT,VTSBSTR codepre  pHere a Set and a Get in this case SetProperty and GetProperty methods are created.

Negative 84917 pI am having a database design issue and im still pretty new to MySQL so I thought I would ask here. What would be the best way to get data for a chronological feed from multiple tables For example a user does many things, they vote, comment, rate, ask questions. I save all this information in their respective tables tblVote, tblRate etc, now the tricky part. a user can follow a user or many, so say you follow 34 people. Following allows you to see their interactions, voting, rating, commenting, asking questions etc in your feed like facebook or something similar.p  pWhat would be the best way to get all the information from all 5 tables for every person they follow and then sort all of that chronologically I Am assuming my current method foreach follower grab all votes, comments, ratings etc  and sort all would be terriblep  pMy working theory, so my working idea is to create a Interaction table, that has a column for the users id, the id of the other tables entry, and a type reference. so for examplep  pstrongUser ID        InteractionID        Typestrongp  precode 9       1232     Comment   10       80      Rating   9        572     Vote codepre  pThen you could just go ahead and grab all Interactions for each of the people they follow, sort that and then say grab the top 10 and query the individual databases to get the full info time of comment, text of comment etcp

So the app isnt bringing back any data for 40 seconds sometimes, as it is waiting for a successful connection to be made.p  pMy question is, is that given the below code, how would I time out the httpconnection if it has been trying for more than say 3 secondsp  pThis way, if it cannot make a successful connection, it will move onto the next URl as opposed to staying on the current one for some time.p  pAny advice will be helpfulp  pThanksp  pCodep  precodepackage com.example.directrssread  import java.io.IOException import java.io.StringReader import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException  import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory import javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException  import org.apache.http.HttpEntity import org.apache.http.HttpResponse import org.apache.http.client.ClientProtocolException import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpGet import org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient import org.apache.http.params.BasicHttpParams import org.apache.http.params.HttpConnectionParams import org.apache.http.params.HttpParams import org.apache.http.util.EntityUtils import org.w3c.dom.Document import org.w3c.dom.Element import org.w3c.dom.Node import org.w3c.dom.NodeList import org.xml.sax.InputSource import org.xml.sax.SAXException  import android.util.Log  public class XMLParser        constructor     public XMLParser                    Getting XML from URL making HTTP request       param url string            public String getXmlFromUrlString url          String xml  null          try               defaultHttpClient             DefaultHttpClient httpClient  new DefaultHttpClient             HttpPost httpPost  new HttpPosturl             HttpGet httpPost  new HttpGeturl               HttpResponse httpResponse  httpClient.executehttpPost             HttpEntity httpEntity  httpResponse.getEntity             xml  EntityUtils.toStringhttpEntity           catch UnsupportedEncodingException e                        e.printStackTrace             return xml          catch ClientProtocolException e              e.printStackTrace             return xml          catch IOException e              e.printStackTrace             return xml                   return XML         return xml                  Getting XML DOM element       param XML string            public Document getDomElementString xml         Document doc  null         DocumentBuilderFactory dbf  DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance         try               DocumentBuilder db  dbf.newDocumentBuilder             dbf.setCoalescingtrue                if dbnull                          InputSource is  new InputSource                 is.setCharacterStreamnew StringReaderxml                 doc  db.parseis                             catch ParserConfigurationException e                  Log.eError , e.getMessage                 return null              catch SAXException e                  Log.eError , e.getMessage                 return null              catch IOException e                  Log.eError , e.getMessage                 return null                           return doc            Getting node value        param elem element            public final String getElementValue2 Node elem             Node child           if elem  null               if elem.hasChildNodes                   for child  elem.getFirstChild child  null child  child.getNextSibling                        if child.getNodeType  Node.TEXTNODE                          if child.getNodeType  Node.TEXTNODE  child.getNodeType  Node.CDATASECTIONNODE                                  return child.getNodeValue                                                                               return            return elem.getTextContent                       Getting node value        param Element node        param key string              public String getValueElement item, String str                   NodeList n  item.getElementsByTagNamestr                     return this.getElementValue2n.item0             codepre
Negative 84917 pstrongSOLVED  see belowstrongp  pIm a little bit afraid of setting up an Development environment with VMWare  CentOS  NGINX. Until now Ive searched both for hours, google and stackoverflow, and it seems to be a never ending story because Ive found a lot but nothing fits for me. The Factsp  pIve installed a VMWare Player on my Win7. In the VM Ive installed a CentOS 7 in Webserver Configuration with a preinstalled NGINX Server. The example directory under codeusrsharenginxhtmlcode has the owner coderootrootcode with codechmod 755code. The default codeindex.htmlcode has codechmod 644code. Furthermore I have three users coderootcode, codenginxcode and codewwwdatacode. The default config under codeetcnginxnginx.confcode has set codeuser nginxcode. NGINX itself runs under coderootcodep  blockquote   p[rootlocalhost html] ps faux  grep nginx p      proot     39466  0.0  0.0  47952  1824         Ss   2249   000 nginx master process usrsbinnginx c etcnginxnginx.confp      pnginx    39487  0.0  0.0  50440  2284         S    2249   000   nginx worker processp blockquote  pIve edited the config file to a minimump  precodeuser nginx  errorlog  varlognginxerror.log debug  events      workerconnections 1024  http      server         listen       80         servername  localhost         root usrsharenginxhtml         location                index index.html index.htm                codepre  pThis works Nginx is showing Welcome to Nginx. Now I made a directory codewwwcode  at least under codecode because I tried codevarwwwhtdocscode for several hours  and created a index.html. After that Ive set coderootcode in the config file to coderoot wwwcode and restarted the server.p  pI tried the following for both, the dir and the index.html in wwwp  ul lirootroot, chmod 777li linginxnginx, chmod 777li liwwwdatawwwdata, chmod 777li ul  pemIf somebody use 777 he must be an idiot or became really desperateem p  pNothing works I get an 403 on every Request. And Ive tried everything from 644 to 777, also in codevarwwwhtdocscode, with every user. I tried to switch the codeuser nginxcode in conf to codeuser rootcode, but this lasts in an error of SELinux. I tried codewwwdatacode also.

It has nothing to do with NGINX or the config itself. Its an issue with SELinux.p  pIf I set codesetenforce 0code, then NGINX works correct. So right now I could edit the SELinux directives, but as it is an devel environment only, it isnt necessary for me.p

Negative 84917 pI am trying to make a Navbar for my site that has a dropdown menu on the left, image in the center, and collapsable item on the right. I am using bootstrap with less to style the navbar, but I am having trouble.p  pI have searched Stack overflow looking for ways to make this work, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19733447bootstrapnavbarwithleftcenterandrightaligneditemsthisa question, but the solutions there arent working for me. I cant seem to get my image to line up so that its horizontal axis is centered with the dropdown menu, collapsable item, and navbar container. When I try the solutions like in the previously mentioned link, taking the image out of the flow of the page by maxing its position fixed, it always appears below the navigation bar. I can fix this for my screen by messing with the CSS attributes, but as soon as I resize the window things look awful.p  pIs there a way possibly using less to style the bootstrap navbar so that no matter what the size of the window is, I have an item on the left, image in center, and item on the right, all sharing a common horizontal center axis with the navbar p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay, so I have changed my mind and decided to just add some links on the left, an image in the center still, and some links on the right. When the screen gets smaller, I want the links to collapse to the right offering a toggle button for a menu. The collapsing is working fine, but when the links are on the screen I want them to be horizontally centered in the nav bar, along with the image. The image right now is partially in the nav bar and partially out. I also want the image to slide to the left when the links collapse at smaller screen sizes.

Negative 84917 pIs it possible for a control binding to behave as codeOneWayToSourcecode and codeOneTimecodep  pHere is some background I have a data grid. Each row has text cells and a codecheckboxcode. If the codecheckboxcode is selected the data from the row will be saved. Now, when user starts typing in any text cell I change the codeIsCheckedcode property in my ViewModel so the codecheckboxcode gets checked. I would like this to happen only once. So, for example, if a user starts typing and decides to uncheck the codecheckboxcode I dont want to change it when the user will start typing value again. p  pSounds for me like setting binding to both codeOneWayToSourcecode and codeOneTimecode should be a solution but I know binding mode can be set only to a single value. Ive been searching for some suggestions and possible workarounds to achieve similar result but with no result.p

Negative 84917 pPerhaps Im asking too much but asking it is much better than assuming it doesnt exists.p  pIn order to create a converter of webpages into single file including all the external resources the html, Im planning to use Data URI Scheme. But the problem with such a conversion is that lots of pages incorporate Javascript codes to come up with the URI of a resource. i. e. its completely ordinary for a page to set the codesrccode of an image with JS.p  pIn worst case scenario, the URI is composed in which cases its absolutely impossible to replace the URI with Data URI Scheme, e. g. codeimg.src  domain.com  somevariable  .pngcode.p  pThe only way I can think of to overcome such scenarios and all other, is to introduce a middle block of code after URI is changed and before it is downloaded. If such opportunity exits, I can work on the requested URI and replace it with appropriate Data URI Scheme. It also benefits from a global Data URI Scheme storage that leads to smaller html file size.p  pDoes anyone know if such opportunity exists Or if one can create itp  pstrong[EDIT]strongp  pHeres how I would like my singlefile webpage to bep  precodeltscriptgt var uridictionary       httpwww.domain.com1.png dataimagepngbase64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN...,     httpwww.domain.com2.png dataimagepngbase64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN...   function translateURIurl      if uridictionary[url]          return uridictionary[url]          else          return url       ltscriptgt codepre  pThe above is a simplified version of the code that Im planning to inject into the singlefile webpage that Im going to generate.

Negative 84917 pIm trying to build a Comic Book database using Core Data.p  pIve created a Book entity and an Artist entity. An Artist entity represents anyone who can work on a comic book  a writer, colorist etc...p  pIve created two relationships between the Book entity and the Artist entity  one for script and one for pencils.  Each of these relationships should also be inverted  each Book entity should know its writer and each writer should know all the book he has worked on. Same goes for pencils. The problem is that Xcode only allows one inverted relationship for same classes.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comToZSS.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comk9jkQ.png altenter image description herep  pHow can I solve this problemp

Negative 84917 pOur app is on Heroku running Rails 4 and Mongoid 4.p  pWe have been using Resque with the Resquepool gem to maximize our job workers.p  pThere are things I like about Resque but we have also had a bunch of problems since upgrading to rails 4, had to roll some code of our own, and generally feel like this project isnt a great fit for us anymore. We also run A LOT of background jobs and can only get 3 processes on the standard heroku dyno before the r14 memory errors start showing up.p  pHad heard good things about Sidekiq from a number of people and so decided to give it a shot.p  pEverything seemed to be integrating well pretty easy switch from Resque to Sidekiq until I got to one of our longer running jobs.p  pThis job copies over a number of mongoid documents. Each of these documents may have a number of associated or embedded documents. All in all, a job of this type that needs to copy  100 documents will spin up about 7001000 jobs in total. Not a trivial number when each dyno only runs 3 processes.p  pWhen this job is run using Resque, the main job finishes in about 45 minutes no problem and then starts working its way through the associated jobs.p  pHowever when this job is run on Sidekiq, it runs VERY slowly compared to Resque and then times out after about 14 minutes. Never giving a status error Sidekiqstatus. When I look in the logs I can see an error from moped when the job finally fails.p  precodeWARN The operation ltMopedProtocolGetmore WARN ..... errorclassgtMopedErrorsCursorNotFound WARN appvendorbundleruby2.1.0bundlergemsmoped2d92a6b9df63libmopedoperationread.rb50in block in excute codepre  pBelow is the code for the jobp  precodeclass WorkspaceAddCollectionsJob  include SidekiqWorker  include SidekiqStatusWorker   sidekiqoptions queue gt archivelyhigh, retry gt 5   def performworkspaceid, collectionids     workspace  Workspace.findworkspaceid     workspace.addcollectionsTag.findcollectionids  end end codepre  pmodelsworkspace.rbp  precodedef addcollectionscollections   o  sharecontactinfo true, sharenotes true    collections.each do collection     collection.profiles.active.each do p        profile  self.addprofilep        wscollection  self.tags.unscoped.findorcreateby name collection.name       wscollection.addtoprofile profile        profile.save     end   end    self end  def addprofilep   o  sharecontactinfo true, sharenotes true    profile  self.profiles.active.anyofsharedtoken p.sharetoken.first    if profile.nil     profile.mergeprofilep, o   else     profile  p.makecopyforself, o   end    profile.save    profile end codepre  pmodelstag.rb tag is aliased as collectionp  precodedef addtoprofileprofile, safetrue   acted  false    if profile.tagids.include self.id     profile.push tagids self.id     acted  true   end    if safe  acted     self.inc profilescount 1     self.set updatedat Time.now.utc      if self.profilescount  1       profile.owner.inc tagscount 1     end   end end codepre  pSo I have no idea what the issue is.

I feel like resque is becoming less of an option as we scale and Im not sure what reasonable alternative there is if not Sidekiq.p  pThanksp

out or find on the internet  I want the checkbox selections to be added to the userRole set in my AppUser.java model, and then to persist them. The thing is, Ive mapped form inputs to object fields before in my project, but never to collection. The optimist in me was pretty much hoping that I could do it just by mapping the checkboxes to the userRole path in the spring form, and maybe java and spring would automagically understand that it should add them to that collection. The realist in me kinda knows that its not all that simple. Honestly, I know its pretty trivial, but I just cant seem to find a solution. Hoping to find that solution here.p  pPS Ive only posted what I deemed to be important to this question. The service layer, for example, seemed to be extra. Will post extra informationcode as required.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ok, I added ROLEUSER in the constructor as per akshays suggestion. The resulting exception when trying to register a new user made me realize that Im going about this entirely wrong. Im trying to assign a String to a Set object. userRole is of type Set, and ROLEUSER is a string. The set contains AppUserRole objects which should contain the username and the respective role string. Basically, the question now is  how can I add a new object containing the username and the respective role straight from the spring form and into the userRole set p

Negative 84917 pI am absolutly new in Hibernate development and I have the following problem.p  pI have 2 entity classes that maps 2 DB tablesp  p1 The first entity class the main one is named strongKMProjectInfostrong and map a DB table named strongKMPROJECTstrong.p  p2 The second entity class is named strongKMProjectInfoStatusstrong and map a DB table named strongKMPROJECTINFOSTATUSstrong.p  pSo the second one represent a specific field of the first one a status of the row representd by an instance of the KMProjectInfo class. Infact I have something like thisp  p1 strongKMProjectInfostrong classp  precodeEntity Tablename  KMPROJECT public class KMProjectInfo implements Serializable       Id     GeneratedValue     private Long idProjectInfo      Columnname  name     private String name      Columnname  technology     private String technology      ManyToOne     JoinColumnname  idCountry     private KMCountry country      Columnname  power     private long power      Columnname  cod     private String cod      ManyToOne     JoinColumnname  idProjectInfoStatus     private KMProjectInfoStatus status       GETTERS amp SETTERS   codepre  p2 strongKMProjectInfoStatusstrongp  precodeEntity Tablename  KMPROJECTINFOSTATUS public class KMProjectInfoStatus implements Serializable       Id     GeneratedValue     private Long idProjectInfoStatus      Columnname  foldertech     private Long foldertech      Columnname  folderproject     private Long folderproject       GETTERS amp SETTERS   codepre  pSo, as you can see in the previous snippet, the strongKMProjectInfoStatussstrong is a field of the strongKMProjectInfostrong because I want that it contains the primary key of this table as foreign key.p  pIn the logic of my application I want that at one row of the strongKMPROJECTstrong table so at one instance of the strongKMProjectInfostrong entity class is associated a single row of the strongKMPROJECTINFOSTATUSstrong one instance of the strongKMProjectInfoStatusstrong entity class because it represent a specific status for the strongKMPROJECTstrong row.p  pIn my code I havep  precodeManyToOne JoinColumnname  idProjectInfoStatus private KMProjectInfoStatus status codepre  pbut I think that is wrong because at one row of my first table it is associated a specific single row of the second table. But maybe I am missing something about how Hibernate work.p  pCan you help me to understand what I am missing What it work Why I have strongManyToOnestrong instead strongOneToOnestrongp  pTnxp

Negative 84917 pI have to store around 250 numerical values per second, per client, which is around 900k numbers per hour. It probably will not be a fullday recording probably between 510 hours a day, but I will partition my data based on the client id and the day the reading is made. The maximum row length comes at about 2223M which is still manageable. Neverteless, my scheme looks like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE measurement    clientid text,   date text,   eventtime timestamp,   value int,   PRIMARY KEY clientid,date, eventtime  codepre  pThe keyspace has a replication factor of 2, just for testing, the snitch is codeGossipingPropertyFileSnitchcode and codeNetworkTopologyStrategycode.

Negative 84917 pI am trying to find out what texture formats are emactuallyem supported by the OpenGL implementation. I know there is a function glGetInternalformat, but it is only helpful in GL4.3 and is almost useless in GLES3.1 and before. So instead I am trying to create a small texture, allocate storage for it using glTexStorage2D and check the error code. However it seems like on OpenGL ES3.1 the function succeeds for all formats I test, but later when I try to upload the actual data to the texture, glTexSubImage2D fails. This happens for at least all 16bit normalized integer formats which are indeed not listed as required in ES3.1 spec. So is there a better and more robust way to query the texture format supportp

Negative 84917 pSo gcc or any C compiler will compile your source to x86 or your respective Assembly language then assemble the assembly into binary and then link it to create an executable. My question is does the java compiler contain an assembler Meaning is there an intermediate stop because I understand bytecode isnt machine code but it is stored as binary and isnt plain text either. Im assuming its just the text based bytecode stored in binary format but I really dont know.p

My problem is that, I want to be able to allow WEKA to identify each of the 0s or 1s on their own so my original plan of classing the attribute as numerical simply will not work.  My question is, how can I get WEKA to understand that each of these values technically mean true or false as to whether that gene has that GO Term.p  pI thought that nominal would work but I am getting WEKA errors stating the file format is incorrect.

Negative 84917 pIm trying to figure out the code for a project but I dont completely understand it. The objective is to write a program that generates a set of 10 random numbers and stores it in an array the 10 numbers display in the textbox correctly. It should have a button that will compute the minimum, maximum and average of the array. I cant seem to get the max and min values of it from a textbox. I know people dont post the answers and Im not looking for that but if someone could tell my why what Im doing for the maxmin is wrong or point my in the right direction I would appreciate it.

Negative 84917 pI have a solution in Visual Studio 2013 with more C project files that have source code in common but are targeting for different platforms .Net, WinRT, .Net Micro Framework and so on. All the csproj files are under the same directory.p  pThese projects use a Nuget package that is available for all the above platforms itself.p  pIf I add this Nuget package for one of the project ex. .Net, the package.config file is created and inside has reference to that target ex. .Net. The package is downloaded in the packages folder.p  pIf I try to add the same package but for a different target to another project in the solution, the UI tells me that the package is already installed. Its true because a package.config file is already there but Id like to have the same package for a different target.p  pSo my question is the following  how can I add the same Nuget package to all different projects but with different targets p  pThanks, Paolop
Negative 84917 pSay I have a Java class codeCoursecode that has some method codetestMethodcode.  How do I expose this functionality such that I can interact with it using handwritten JavaScript as followsp  precodesomeCourse.testMethod codepre  pwhere codesomeCoursecode is passed directly from the Java code via a native method, likep  precodeprivate native void AssociateCourseCourse course      someCourse  course  codepre  pThe main issue I am having in achieving this is that GWT does not provide any way for me to access the prototype of the codeCoursecode constructor.  For example, the following is invalidp  precodeprivate native void Expose      wnd.Course  mypackage.Course  codepre  pbecause it expects it to access some field, not the whole thing.p  pI would like to avoid using a library like gwt exporter because I feel that having to incorporate that into my source code which handles application logic will make it difficult to separate those two aspects of my code, which will be a bad thing if the code were shared between a GWT project like this and an Android application, for example.p
Negative 84917 pa hrefhttpapps.microsoft.comwindowsenusappguitarcorec904ea62f59647ffab28c9bab29e6974 relnofollowI submitted an app last night to the Windows Storea. It ran, tested, and deployed just fine on the Surface Pro 3 I developed it on. I even trialed, purchased, and downloaded it to make sure the deployment was successful. All was good. p  pHowever, when I downloaded it to an old ASUS laptop running Windows 8.1 on my account, it opened to the splash and then the app screen went completely black. I do not have any other devices to test on other than my Surface and ASUS, and Im concerned the issue might affect more devices.

Negative 84917 pIm trying to map a generated 2D texture on a quad. So far the quad is rendered, but it is gray if I dont set a color and if I set colors for the vertices it shows the colors, yet the texture is not shown.p  pThe reason for using fixed pipeline instead of shaders is that in order to generate the texture I would have to pass too much data to the shaders to generate the texture efficiently. So ideally I do not want to have a shader for something that should be as simple as rendering a texture on a quad. Although the program uses shaders extensively. p  pI tried using GLubyte for passing the data to glTexImage2D but got the same result. Also I tried various positions to call glEnableGLTEXTURE2D, glBindTexture, glTexParameteri and glTexImage2D. Furthermore, I commented glTexEnvf, glBindTexture unbinding, glDisableGLTEXTURE2D and glDeleteTextures.... All with the same result.p  pMaybe it is not possible to use fixed pipeline texture rendering in a program that also uses shaders Or did I make a mistake in my code As far as I can see and according to Google the code below should render the texture on the quad.

I am currently able to populate ALL games stored in the library by using getElementsByTagNameGame, but I need them to be specific to the playlist which is also assigned a unique id with an attributeID set to true for Id. p  pHowever, in the below code, I need to do something like readLib.getElementByIdid.getChildNodes but every time I do so I get a nullpointer exception at that line.

Negative 84917 pI noticed today that some new properties had appeared in my intellisense on the codeSystem.Typecode object for my .NET 4.5 projects. Among these was one called codeCustomAttributescode.p  pI was intrigued by this since I previously had understood that codeGetCustomAttributescode was one of the most expensive reflection calls codeDynamicInvokecode and the like aside, of course. As I understand it, every call to codeGetCustomAttributescode results in calling the constructors for the attributes and thus a memory allocation. Ive often resorted to caching the custom attributes separately to avoid performance bottlenecks when processing large numbers of types and such.p  pSo, I wrote up a test to see if codeCustomAttributescode was any more performant than codeGetCustomAttributescodep  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args      var sw  Stopwatch.StartNew      Debug.WriteLinetypeofAttributed.GetType      for int i  0 i lt 10000 i              var attrs  typeofAttributed             .CustomAttributes             .Selecta gt a.AttributeType             .ToList           sw.Stop     Debug.WriteLineUsing .NET 4.5 CustomAttributes property 0, sw.Elapsed      sw  Stopwatch.StartNew      for int i  0 i lt 10000 i              var attrs  typeofAttributed             .GetCustomAttributestrue             .Selecta gt a.GetType             .ToList           sw.Stop     Debug.WriteLineUsing GetCustomAttributes method 0, sw.Elapsed  codepre  pWith some test classesp  precode[Dummy] [Dummy] [Dummy] [Dummy] [Dummy] [Dummy] class Attributed    [AttributeUsageAttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultipletrue] class DummyAttribute  Attribute      public DummyAttribute            codepre  pThe results were surprisingp  precodeSystem.RuntimeType Using .NET 4.5 CustomAttributes property 000000.1351259 Using GetCustomAttributes method 000000.0803161 codepre  pThe new codeCustomAttributescode property was actually slower than the existing codeGetCustomAttributescode methodp  pDebugging further, I discovered that the attribute constructors were not called for iterating codeCustomAttributescode which I expected since it looks like it is just reading the metadata. Yet somehow, it was slower than codeGetCustomAttributescode which calls constructors.p  h2My Questionh2  pPersonally I think it is more readable to use the new property, but the cost is 1.5xish slower performance.p  pSo, what advantage is there, if any, of using codeCustomAttributescode instead of codeGetCustomAttributescodep  pIm assuming the situation where we are simply checking to see if an attribute of some type exists on the clas...not using methods or properties on the instance of the attribute.p
Negative 84917 pSo Ive got a task that takes a strongrandom 20 of a tables results from the previous daystrong to use as a control group. These results are put into a table, and then shoved into a .CSV file for use by the employer. p  pThat works perfectly well. The only problem is, its in a group of tasks that are often tested, which means that when the task gets repeated, more random data gets dumped into the file  meaning manual deletion of rows. Im looking for a fix.p  pBecause the process is run once a day, a unique key is the emTransactionDateIDem, formatted INT 20150603. I need to check against that column to make sure that nothing has been run on that same day. The problem is exacerbated because it involves strongyesterdaysstrong records. p  pFor example. In order to check todays date to see if it has been run, getDate would be used to get todays date, then converted to INT 20150604.

Negative 84917 pI am developing a stockticker slowly but surely as I am learning javascriptp  pIt seems to be working well, and I am now trying to style the ticker so it has a show more button.

Negative 84917 pApologies if this is a bit of a vague question Ill try to word it as appropriately as I can.p  pBasically I have a C application that currently runs off of a backend MSSQL SQL Server 2014 database. To ease in database communication and building the entity model we assembled our own set of C classes that wrap up the native ADO.NET calls we have created it in such a way that the developer simply needs to supply details for a connection string and it is assembled as part of the connection method like sop  precodestring.FormatTDRIVERSQL ServerSERVERssUIDsPWDsDATABASEs,string,strConnInstance,strUser,strPassword,strDatabase codepre  pWe now have a requirement to read from an oracle database, and we wonder if we can use the same connection libraries. I assume that we will need to tweak the connection string e.e.g the driver would need to read something different. I believe I have read that Oracle connection can be faciliated through use of an ODBC driver Would it simply be a case of installing the relevant driver if so, which and changing the Driver argument in the connection string if so, to what.p  pIf it is not quite this simple, is there any other way it can be done, or are we looking at a redevelopmentp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 84917 pIm working on a project settlers 2.5 return to the roots namely which suffers some problems. I hope to be able to solve some of them by using only stl containers and bounds checking.p  pSo is it somehow possible to use boundschecking in STL containers also in release mode So we could use a less performing version, that does them and crashesthrows on errorp  pThe build server uses MinGW to crosscompile from linux to windows and apple.p  pEdit []operator is used exclusively. Changing to .at would require a large searchandreplace action which got to be reversed at some point. Best would be, if there is a define or something that switches []behaviour to .atp
Negative 84917 pIm working on a Oauth2 Token system to access my REST API for my Android app. Im having some problems with the token refreshment part on the client side.p  pHere is the flow  My app makes a request with an access Token in parameter to the server thanks some asynctask  codePostCommentAsyncTaskcode, codeAddFriendAsyncTaskcode etc..., so if the accessToken is valid its ok, but if it has expired I call another codeAsyncTaskcode  codeGetRefreshTokenAsyncTaskcode from the codeonPostExecutecode method  of the precedent codeAsyncTaskcode to get new accessToken.

Negative 84917 pI am trying to to draw a custom slider which has a tooltip that fades in and out on touch events. I am having trouble with the canvas clip bounds. The tooltip is placed above the slider, giving it negative canvas coordinates, which should be fine since I replace the clip bounds on every OnDraw. p  pWhen running on a Lenovo tablet it works just as expected, but on the Google Nexus 7 something odd happens. The clip bound are only acknowledged the very first OnDraw I have tried filling the canvas with a solid color just to see its size and after that, even though debugging says the clipBounds are correct, everything outside the original clipbounds are clipped.p  pDoes anyone know what could be causing this behaviourp

Negative 84917 pI have a web app which calls a webApi, my webApi calls my services, and my service calls my DbContext.p  pI have 2 entities, Content and File.  These are separate entities and stored in separate tables.p  pNow i also have a collection against Content, called Files.  This is used to reference a file to a content entity.p  pEntity framework has thus created tables called Content, File and ContentFile.  My configuration for entity framework, is like sop  precodepublic ContentConfig       base      this.HasManyltFilegts gt s.Files         .WithManyc gt c.Contents         .Mape gt                      e.MapLeftKeyContentId             e.MapRightKeyFileId             e.ToTableContentFile           codepre  pTo my webApi, i am sending my data for content, which looks like sop  precodeId  1, Files        Id  1, Name  Test   codepre  pHere i have a content entity that already exists with an Id of 1, and a File that already exists with an Id of 1.  I am passing this as i would expect Entity Framework to create a relationship between the 2 entities.p  pIn my service, i have this code.p  precodepublic Taskltintgt AddOrUpdateAsyncContent content       attach all files     foreach var file in content.Files         context.Entryfile.State  EntityState.Modified      context.Entrycontent.State  EntityState.Modified      return context.SaveChangesAsync  codepre  pAll this seems to do, is update my content entity and update the file entity.  No relationship is inserted  Can someone help me to insert the relationship  What happens if it already exists on Update  Will entity framework figure that out for mep  pSeems so hard to deal with entities when everything is disconnected  Or is this just me  In my unit test, this works, but the entities are not disconnected.p  pNot sure if it has anything to do with it, but i am using AutoMapper to create my entities from my webApi models.p
Negative 84917 pIve built a small website that acts as a brochure on an Android tablet Acer Iconia One 8. We preload these tablets with the site, videos, etc. and give them away to prospective clients. The tablet is configured with WiFi off and the site loads from the local filesystem. This works fine.p  pThere is an intro video on the index page of the site. I want it to play once, then disappear to reveal the site and never play again, unless the user taps the appropriate button to manually call it up.p  pTo do this Im using jquery.cookie.js with the following code in the headp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  window.loadfunction     if.cookieintroVidPlayorHide          introVid.attrsrc,assetsvideovideo.mp4         .cookie introVidPlayorHide, 1           introVid.bindended, function         introVid.hide       ltscriptgt codepre  pThen, at the bottom of the page before bodyp  precodeltscriptgt if.cookieintroVidPlayorHide      introVid.hide  ltscriptgt codepre  pThis works perfectly in a desktop browser Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE9, running from MAMP. The video loads one time, at the end it disappears and returning to the home page shows only the site, not the video. p  pOn the tablet, the cookie is either not being set or not being read. Unfortunately, this whole thing has to run in the Dolphin browser Chrome doesnt work correctly for our purpose. The video shows every time you return to the home page.p  pI have verified that jQuery is loading and working fine. I cant see any way in the Dolphin browser to view cookies so I dont know if the cookie is not being set or if its not being read or both. I suspect this problem has something to do with the site loading from the local filesystem and not via a web server. Any ideas Thanksp  pedit Ive read through a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6232331settingcookiesusingjavascriptinalocalhtmlfilethis posta, but it doesnt address my issue. The Dolphin browser is a Webkit browser and none of the answers apply, only Chrome, Firefox and IE. I think Chrome was a Webkit browser at the time of the post, but that was 4 years ago.p

However I dont want to use these XSD files to verify an XML file I want to parse these XSDs as XML and interrogate them just as I would a normal XML file. This is possible because XSDs are valid XML. I am using lxml with Python3.p  pThe problem Im having is with the statementp  precodeltxsinclude schemaLocationsdmextension.xsdgt codepre  pIf I instruct lxml to create an XSD for verifying like thisp  precodeschema  etree.XMLSchemaschemaroot codepre  pthis dependency will be resolved the file exists in the same directory as the one Ive just loaded. HOWEVER, I am treating these as XML so, correctly, lxml just treats this as a normal element with an attribute and does not follow it.p  pIs there an easy or correct way to extend lxml so that I may have the same or similar behaviour as, sayp  precodeltxiinclude hrefmetadata.xml parsexml xpointertitlegt codepre  pI could, of course, create a separate xml file manually that includes all the dependencies in the XSD schema. That is perhaps a solutionp

Negative 84917 pIm looking at ways to rendergenerate a PDF file using Express. p  pThe template is reasonably simple using serverside rendering, but its a bit much for something like pdfkit. Im generating an html page and converting it to PDF via wkhtmltopdf I chose that over PhantomJS, which was a bit more complicated and wasnt solving my problems, at least with the npm packages I was using. Id also like the ability to serve the web page as html, though that isnt a hard requirement.  p  pMy first attempt was to generate the html, then pass it through wkhtmltopdf and pipe that to the response. The issue there is that this is a small component of a much bigger web app, and many of the files served from vastly distributed parts of the file system. For example, especially on a dev system requests to scripts might be served from one of appscripts, .tmpscripts, componentsscripts, etc. This means that its impractical for wkhtmltopdf to resolve any linked images or stylesheets.p  pWhat Ive ended up doing is reproxing the request through localhost, so Express can handle the file resolution logic. p  precoderouter.usefunctionreq, res, next   ifreq.query.pdf  req.getcontenttype  applicationpdf     ifreq.query.download       res.setHeadercontenttype, applicationpdf       res.headerContentDisposition, attachment filenamequote.pdf          proxy to local to resolve dependencies     var local  httplocalhost  req.app.settings.port  req.baseUrl  req.path     try       wkhtmltopdflocal, pageSize letter, title Quote.piperes     catche       log error       next  fall back to HTML         else        next      handle get param logic render response codepre  pThis works fine in test. Here are my questions p  ol liIs there a better way to approach this Is there a way to have wkhtmltopdf wrap the response without having it call the serverli liThe downside of this approach is that Id like to use order information to determine whether to render the page as letter of A4, and I dont have access to the order when calling wkhtmltopdf, as its already rendered into the page. Any way around thatli ol  pThanksp
Negative 84917 pBy reading at several articles posted here, I get mismatched information about how to properly configure a project. p  pstrongI am looking for advise about how the pros do it at the enterprise level.strongp  pI see different schools of though about this, some people design in a truly NTier fashion, others prefer to use EF Code First directly in the MVC application and have FAT models and sort of have one big MVC app with logical separation of concerns, etc.p  pSo for a midsize project this is my set up and I want to ask for your opinions about it.p  pstrongMVC applicationstrongp  pModels  Here my models have just what the view needs, validation logic, etc. These models are designed to pass data between the controller and views only.p  pControllers  Call the service layer where business logic lives and gets domain models back if needed. Converts domain models into view models and viceversa.p  pstrongService layerstrongp  pThis is were the business domain logic lives. The service layer is also in charge of communicating with the data layer to perform CRUD operations.  The service layer returns domain models to the controller in the MVC application and also expects domain models when invoked.p  pstrongData Repository layerstrongp  pThe data layer is a thin wrapper around EF and performs CRUD operations. usually I will have a Code First approach where entity models are created for me by EF. I convert the EF code first models to domain models and return these to the service layer. The data layer also expect domain models from the service layer that in turn I convert to EF code first models and persist to the DB.p  pstrongDomain Model layerstrongp  pThese are the domain models that are used and shared thorough the applications layers.p  pWhats best design Whats expected at the enterprise levelp

Negative 84917 pIf there are no another overloadings say, codefT ampcode or codefvolatile T ampampcode of a member function template codetemplatelt typename T gt fT ampampcode, then codeT ampampcode is socalled emforwarding referenceem, and codeTcode is either codeUcode, or codeU ampcode for some emcvqualifiedem type codeUcode.

Negative 84917 pI am creating a floating banner ad that is supposed to stay fixed to the bottom of the page. I created the ad and uploaded it to DoubleClick Studio. In the preview tab Im seeing that the ad doesnt stay fixed to the bottom of the page and instead moves up and down with the content as it scrolls. Ive inspected the banner on Chrome to find that the container div that houses the ad is set to position absolute instead of position fixed. If it was set to fixed this would solve the issue, but I have no control over changing the positioning of the container of the ad, I can only say where the ad should be positioned  bottom, top, left or right.p  pHas anyone experienced this issue Does anyone have any ideas for how this can be fixed Ive reached out to a few people at DoubleClick hoping that theyll have some suggestions, but I thought that the stackoverflow community would be able to help as well.p  pIf it helps, I used Google Web Designer to create the banner ad. This is the first HTML5 ad that Ive created and uploaded to DoubleClick Studio. All previous ads were Flash banners.p
