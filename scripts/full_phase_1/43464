Positive 43464 pI have a rails app using sidekiq w redis for mailers. I have 2 workers, but for one of them I get wrong number of arguments error ArgumentError wrong number of arguments 5 for 2  and I dont know why since the other one, which is basically the same, works perfectly. Here is the codeexplanation for both Contactmailer w Postmanworker is the working one which sends out an email when sby submits a contact form Taskmailer w Taskcreatorworker gives the error, which sends out an email when a task gets created. Ive already tried with different number of arguments, as I see I have 6 args at the moment but still gives the 5 for 2 error  Prior to sidekiq, taskmailer worked as well. For first I tried to pass only 2 args task.id and currentuser and I could call all the 6 variables that can be found in taskcreated.html.erb. Since then Ive tried different kind and number of args. As you see below, at the moment I try to give all the 6 variables in controller and mailer as well exactly as they are called. I also show the user.rb since model is a bit tricky.p  pSince the contact mailer works perfectly both in devprod env, I likely made a mistake in the code below and its not a serverinstallation

Positive 43464 pI have, say, 4 keys in a Redis database.  The keys have an expiration of 10 seconds from now.  I have added the keys to a set.  When the keys expire, they are effectively not in the database anymore get returns null value.  However, the keys are still members of the set.  The set will continue to exist until the keys are removed from the set, at which point it too effectively is gone from the database.p  pIs it possible to automatically remove a key from the sets to which it belongs when the key expiresp  pI am thinking of maintaining one set per key to maintain the sets which it belongs to making a digraph set relationship between keys and sets, and then registering for key expiration events to remove the set members when necessary.  This is a lot of overhead to do as a consumer of the db, rather than as some kind of background cleanup thread inside.  And, such an approach would be besteffort to cleanup sets, as the consumer code which subscribes to the expiration events might crash, not get the notification, get backlogged, etc.p  pI may have been able to avoid any trickery by modeling the set of keys as fields in a hash set, but I wish to have different expiration TTLs per key in practice.

Positive 43464 pQuestion here about caching data from calls to an external ReST API. p  pThere is currently a ReST service set up to generate and retrieve some specific types of reports that the UI must consume. However, this service is not meant for high volume usage, or to be exposed to the public and these reports are fairly static. Possibly only changing every 1020 minutes. The web application resides on a separate server. p  pWhat I would like to do is, using memcached or Redis, is when a request for data comes in from the UI to the web backend, make a call from the web application backend to the report server to get the specified report, transform the data to the appropriate format for the UI to consume, cache it with a timestamp, and return it to the UI so subsequent requests will be available in memory on the web applications backend without having to rerequest from the report server. I would also need to check this timestamp and make a new request if the cached report has been held for longer than the specified time. The data that will be cached is fairly minuscule just some smallish JSON objects with only a handful of values holding the information the UI needs and there is NOT a ton of these objects, I would not be surprised if they could all be easily stored in memory at once so the time stamping is the only invalidation that should be necessary.p  pI have almost 0 experience here when it comes to caching  memcached  Redis.

Positive 43464 pI dont have experience scalingout SQL backend, but from what Ive read so far, sharding for writes and caching for reads seem to be two of the most common practices. Im trying to learn how eventual consistency could be minimized with the right caching strategy.p  pId like to use Azure SQL Database, Entity Framework amp Elastic Scale middleware, and Redis for testing purposes.p  pemIs there a way to commit a distributed transaction to both SQL Server and Redisem p  pemIf not, whats an effective way to ensure read freshness when a database change occursem p  pI could write to SQL and update cache in the same API, but writing to cache might fail for whatever reason. I could implement a retry logic, but assuming all attempts fail, I could try to rollback the SQL transaction or simply serve old cache data to clients and periodically rebuild cache to catch up with the database. Of course, the latter would mean data reads are not consistent for a period of time. Evicting data and reading from the SQL cluster is another option, but crossshard queries might be very expensive, especially when they involve complex joins and you have hundreds, if not thousands, of databases on commodity hardware.p

Positive 43464 pUsing PHPRedis and Apache PHPFPM Im using the pconnect call to reuse connections  its been helpful in past to not let the number of connections creep up too high.

The pconnect however is still holding a connection to the old maste  so set commands begin to fail.p  pWhat we need is a way to tear down those persistent connections  but short of restarting Apache I cant figure out how to do it.

Negative 43464 pAs a hobby project I am currently trying to create a small browserbased game  and I thought it would be the right thing to code it using the MVC pattern, separating the games engine from presentation.

In the current design most of the engine is dominated by the players character object  there are such things as location, monster or item, but it is a character that does most of the actions travels, attacks, buys items etc. I know there are probably other ways to design such engine, but somehow I cant figure it out, so Im asking for some tips or advices here.p  pOh, and the server backend will be phpmysql, if that in any way matters.p

Negative 43464 pI have a design conundrum that I could use some feedback on, so Im hoping my fellow SharePoint experts can help me work this out.p  pI am managing a set of Projects in a single MOSS List List1, where the Project Name column will be treated as a primary key at least in my mind for related Lists.  Each Project will have associated with it a set of defined deliverables up to 37 separate activities throughout each projects lifetime, and each deliverable will track one significant activity that is recommended to complete during the project.p  pMy initial thinking was to define the 37 deliverables in a separate lookup List List2, so that each deliverable had not just a Deliverable Name but alsop  pURL  linking to a separate nonMOSS wiki, where the user can find more info on how to accomplish the deliverable Description  to give a quick explanation of what the deliverable means without having to send the user off to a separate server to get any details Project phase  to help us filter and sort the deliverables into the order in which theyre required to be completed Role  to identify the primary project role that owns completion of the deliverablep  pThen I would create individual items in another List List3, each of which was associated with 1 the Project and 2 the template item in the deliverables lookup List, so that we could track additional these perprojectperdeliverable fields p  pCompletion date  date when deliverable was finished if ever How dispositioned  a dropdown list, from which the user can choose states such as completed, postponed, na or still in process Notes  freeform text to record more explanationsrationale on what was done and whyp  pThe one major problem with this approach is that Microsofts best practices guidance strongly discourages MOSS Lists with  2000 items in the List.  Even if we never added more deliverables to each Project, Im afraid that well scale beyond 54 projects which how many Im allowed  200037 in very short order.  Creating multiple instances of List3 is theoretically possible, but strikes me as a nightmare to automate as my set of tracked Projects grows.p  pThe first alternative I can think of is to predefine 37 additional columns in the Projects list, plus the 37 x 3 columns needed to enable the date, disposition and notes fields that the users will need to track for each deliverable.  Plus having to manage a brittle configurationdesign of each of the SPD Forms amp web part Pages that Id like to use to pretty up the UI for all this data entry amp data management.p  pAnother alternative someone suggested to me is to create subSites for each Project, and list the projects deliverables in a single List in the projects subSite.  Seems awfully heavyweight to me, and Im considering this only as my last resort.p  pHow would any of you pull this off in MOSS without relying on an outside database, or any code that would have to be installed to the server  Is there some trick to making this work, that isnt obvious from the usual MOSS List functionality  Is there some hidden feature of MOSS I should use  Some neat aspect of SharePoint Designer I havent discovered yet   I emhaveem to believe that many others have faced this same limitation, and have figured out emsomeem way to make it work.

Negative 43464 pI am working on a program which includes a general purpose engine, some program specific content, and a custom automatic updater to handle updating the many gigabytes worth of media in our content as efficiently as possible. In a recent release of the engine, we have reorganized our directory structure, such that instead of the executable installing to for example codecProgram FilesProgramEngine.execode, it is now in codecProgram FilesProgramenginewin32NewEngine.execode note that the name of the engine changed as well in this process.p  pThe problem is that in order to launch the program, the user needs to use a shortcut, which we install in their start menu and optionally on their desktop.

Does this mean that regardless of the separate xib files, all views are loaded on start upp  pMy point of all this is  I want the multiViewController to be my main menu which will have separate buttons for displaying the other xib files when clicked.  I had been placing my initalize code in the viewDidLoad but this seems wrong now as I dont want to hit until the users presses the button to display that view.p  pAn example was to have a view that is  playGameViewController.  In the viewDidLoad I was checking to see if a prior game was in progress and if so, prompt the user if they would like to resume.  In the above case, when the app starts, it prompts right away because the viewDidLoad is firing even though I only wanted to display the main menu first.p  pAny explanation is greatly appreciated.

My question is why Im having validation errors in two places that seem to be defined in the schema.p  pHeres an examplep  pSchema 1 you can see that IdentificationType has subelements for IdentificationID and IdentificationCodep  p                                          A data type for a representation of an identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     p  pSchema 2 IdentificationCodeSpecial has a substitutioGroup of schema1IdentificationCodep  pp  pThe xml looks like thisp  p which is typed as IdentificationType               p  pSo, why is IdentificationCodeSpecial throwing a validation error  Is there a problem with substitutionGroupsp  pI did find problems with using the xsd.exe tool to generate a c class namely, it didnt handle includes properly, so I used a different tool.

Negative 43464 pI recently moved my development to a Windows 7 machine, and am having all sorts of trouble getting basic things to work.

Not to mention that all my jQuery stuff is broken, given that my .js scripts are in a scripts folder.

Turns out that when I browse to that page, I see my text, but no image. Makes me wonder if IIS 7.5s security has been ratcheted down tons more than before.p  pThanks, Chrisp

Negative 43464 pI am trying to move from the typical combination of APC for opcode and Memcache for my userdata to a purely apc based cache.  Given my usage structure it makes sense and performance is higher. p  pBut unlike before, where the apc cache was limited to a reasonable size and did not affect my data cache, I am now worried that the opcode cache might grow relatively large so that the sum of opcode cache an datacache exceeds the limit.  As far as I understand, this would result in a flush of the total cache.p  pIs there a way to mimic the behaviour, as if apc was only an opcode cache and limit the opcode cache size to a reasonable limit, leaving the rest for user datap  pOr should I try setting lower ttl values for the opcode cache, so it always gets flushed firstp

Negative 43464 pIm using org.apache.tools.ant.listener.Log4jListener to manage logging with my ant script.  The ant script is highly configurable and designed to be run different ways with different parameters and therefore I need to be able to log to files specified at runtime.  I have a log4j.properties which specifies a log file to be build.log, and despite my attempts to launch ant redefining properties defined in log4j.properties have been unsuccessful. p  pThe build ignores them and continues to write to build.log.  I havent found much support regarding writing to custom files unless its in Java with their Logger class.  p  pPerhaps Im thinking this through wrong.  log4j.properties isnt treated in the same way as a property file in an ant script hence overrideable from the command line  Is there a way I can do this intelligently without writing a custom task or somethingp

Negative 43464 pI am working with a preexisting zencart site has been worked on over the years by multiple teams. Backtracking through all of the teams is not a viable option. Some of the development teams implemented some hacks, one of them being replacing how zencart normally creates links, and I am stuck as to how they did it. For example, zencart normally links to a product through a link such as the one belowp  precodehttpyoursite.comindex.phpmainpageproductinfoampcPath67ampproductsid823 codepre  pInstead, this zencart installation is doing the followingp  precodehttpyoursite.comitemnameherep45.htmlcPath126 codepre  pI have figured out that the number after p, in this case 45, is the product ID. However, I am stuck as to what that .html file is actually referencing. I am guessing that it is somehow feeding that data back into the index.php file, and it was done for search engine optimization purposes. The server is using nginx if that makes a difference. I would rather use apache for this site, but I am fine with nginx. p  pAdditionally, there are also links such as p  precodehttpyoursite.comsitemap.html codepre  pbut there is no file called sitemap.html on the entire system. However, there is a file called sitemap.xmlp  pFor a myriad of reasons, I cant link to the actual site and I hope you fellow developers can understand that. However, if anyone has any idea as to whats going on here, I would be very interested to know. I will provide what other details I can.p

Negative 43464 h2Problemh2  pUnicode categories are often too exclusive or too inclusive to function as categories for processing text consistently, regardless of whether it was typed in notepad where keystrokes map to ASCII doublesingle quotes, apostrophes, etc. or Microsoft Word where keystrokes map to nonASCII characters in Unicode or a Windows code page.p  h2Desired Categories for Text Processingh2  pId like to build a text processor using Regex expressions that can consistently and exhaustively identify language elements likep  ol liapostrophe used in a contraction, presumably with a letter on each sideli liquote and more specifically whether each is initialfinalsingledoubleli lidash em dash, en dash, hyphen, minus, etc.  Unicode category DashPunctuationli liopenclose grouping punctuation parenthesis, brackets, braces, etc.  Unicode categories OpenPunctuation and ClosePunctuationli ol  pHowever, such categories do not always correspond with any particular Unicode category or set of categories.p  h2QuoteApostrophe Issueh2  pCategories like InitialQuotePunctuation and FinalQuotePunctuation dont distinguish between single and double quotes, and they actually exclude the common ASCII double and single quotes, which are neutralstraight and therefore fall into neither the initial nor final category specifically.  Instead, we find them in the OtherPunctuation category, along with many other common but unrelated punctuation symbols.  The real problem is that we need to separate out the single quote characters to get a complete set of potential apostrophe characters, since someone could use such characters as an apostrophe.p  pAlso a problem for quotesapostrophes, is that the grave and acute symbols, which could easily be used as a quoteapostrophe by typing in notepad, are under the ModifierSymbol category.p  h2Final Thoughts on Desired Solutionh2  pI think the dash and parenthetical categories are fairly complete, although the DashPunctuation category excludes the swung dash and dashed overline, which are found in OtherPunctuation category with the ASCII singledouble quotes.p  pI imagine that detecting the language elements Ive identified above would require a two stage process where a single Unicode character such as an ASCII apostrophe would be allowed to fall into multiple categories at first such as apostrophe AND single quote, such that a secondary contextual check could resolve which category is the best fit for its apparent usage.p  pThe Regex for the quote category might include a character class like this [pPipPf], with an additional check to ensure it has a nonletter character on one side or the other.p  h2Questionh2  pstrongHow can I systematically and reliably identify all possible characters of each of the four categories listedstrong  As I explained, Unicode categories alone arent sufficient.p

Negative 43464 pHi I am a newbie in iOS and thus has a confusion.p  pI am designing an app which will draw some strokes in screen as well as record your voice from iPad. As you are drawing something you may also like to record your voice too. p  pI got both of them working but not efficiently. The drawing experience is not smooth while the recording of sound goes on parallel. For example, if I tap on a button I am supposed to draw the line and start recording what I am saying. I am running sound recorder in a separate thread using code[self performSelectorInBackgroundselectorstartRecordingSound]code but the drawing process is not smooth now. Mind that the drawing process runs in Main thread.p  pI guess this is not the efficient way to call two heavily process oriented operations. p  pCan any one throw some lights on what is the best way to put both of these tasks concurrently in iPad so that none of the tasks blocks the otherp

Negative 43464 pI am trying to retrieve page contents with an codeAJAXcode call.  I have a series of links within a page wrapper.  When I click on a link, it loads a JavaScript function that retrieves page contents from a codephpcode script.  In this case I am developing on my codelocalhostcode, but in production the script will be within the same root folder and domain as the file that does the codeAJAXcode call.  I am using the response as the content for a codedivcode.  The content isnt purely codePHPcode, and by that I mean while it is generated by php it has codeHTMLcode elements like codedivcodes and spans.  Its basically the stuff that is going between the opening and closing body tags.  Because of this, Im not sure I can just use codejsonencodecode.p  pInstead of the content loading in the codedivcode, I get the following errorp  blockquote   pWarning requireonce [function.requireonce] http wrapper is   disabled in the server configuration by allowurlinclude0p blockquote  pAfter reading up on codeallowurlincludecode it seems that this is usually disabled by default.

Im upgrading to both the new JavaScript SDK and the PHP SDK to use their latest oAuth stuff before the October 1 deadline.p  pThe PHP SDK now comes with an abstract codeBaseFacebookcode and they have an example codeFacebookcode class implementation that relies on PHP codeSESSIONcodes.

Negative 43464 pI built a test case of an ajax call jQuery 1.6.2 that looks like p  precodejQuery document .ready function        var test  function x           .ajax             url httpwww.someotherdomain.comtest.php,             data  x x ,             dataType jsonp,             crossDomain true,             success function data                    console.log data.name               ,             error function                   x                  test x                                  test 1   codepre  pAnd the corresponding test.php file looks likep  precodeif  5 gt GET[ x ]       headerHTTP1.1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable die  else      header contenttype applicationxjavascript      echo GET[ callback ] . nameMorgan  codepre  pEven though the a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comjQuery.ajaxjQuery documentationa indicates that the error handler for jsonp calls is never fired, this script works just as I intended.  It makes four unsuccessful calls to test.php which return 503 errors, and then codetestcode recursively calls itself incrementing x until the ajax call is successful and the data is output to the console.p  pSo my test case above works, but my actual code doesnt work, which looks more like the followingp  precodejQuery document .ready function        var completed  0     var fiftystates  assume an array of state objects     var updateState  function index, state           var d  index  5  for subdomains sub0, sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4         .ajax             url httpsub  d  .mydomain.comupdatestate.php,             data  state state.id ,             dataType jsonp,             crossDomain true,             success function                   completed                  var completepercent  completed  fiftystates.length  100                  progressbar .progressbar value, completedpercent              ,             error function                  updateState index, state                         end ajax       end updateState      fiftystates .each updateState   codepre  pAs you can see, this loops through 5 different subdomains which are actually just mirrors of the same domain, but since updatestate.php can take up to 30 seconds to complete, this takes a 25 minute process down to less than three minutes.  The problem is that the server pounding causes some of the ajax requests to fail with a 503 error.  In my test case this was handled with no problem but in my second example, the error handler never seems to get called.p  pI cant figure out why the test case works as I expect and the second one doesnt.

Negative 43464 pI didnt really know how to create a good question for my problem, but at least I hope it covers the essence of what Im after.p  pThe specific project I am working on right now is to a great extent scaled and values from a database sets most of the properties and displayed elements on the page for each customer.p  pBut, on some points I dont know of any good, simple methods of scaling as in for instancep  pWhen a customers logs in, it is presented with a form for creation of an entry. Which input fields are displayed are based on what is set in the DB. So far, so good. But, for most customers there is a field called code which is usually a 4digit INT. Furhtermore, some customers are allowed to fill in this code manually, but for others its being automatically generated after submission based on given conditions.p  pMy scaling problem occurs in the last event. Because there are two different ways of that input field to be displayed its either displayed as an active input, or a disabled input. I solved this adding a column to my customers table in the DB which is either enabled or disabled and the input field is displayed correspondingly.p  pAnd this is the part which has really put my little gray ones to work If the field is disabled and the code is automatically genereated, some customers may have a given number of entries with code values 1,2,3,4 for their respective entries. For some customers, if the entry with the number 2 is deleted that number can be reused upon creation of a new entry, but for others, that number is forever taken and the only possible assignable number to a new entry is in this instance 5. Worth to note that the code is ALWAYS in series from low to high, never random.p  pAs far as my knowledge goes this is the only solution I have come up with  p  ol liAdd a field to the database and have three conditions 1 for normal active field, 2 for disabled field with reusable numbers and 3 for disabled field with nonreusable numbers always increments 1 from the highest value in the DB. li liCreate respective functions to call if the user has either of the three options.li ol  pThe three functions would then be  p  ol liecho out the normal, active field and store the value enteredli liecho out the disabled field, check the numbers present in the db and give the entry the lowest possible code value that isnt present e.g. if there are 3 entries with values 1,3,4  give the new entry the value of 2li liecho out the disabled field, check the highest number which would be the last entry and give the new entry the code of the highest number 1li ol  pWould this be a good way to go about this Or could it be done more effectively I know the semantics of using 1, 2 or 3 as conditions isnt good, but its just for illustration in this example.p

Negative 43464 pThis question is surely answered here somewhere, but I couldnt find it. Ive been writing Java for over a decade now and my C experience was on Unix, so Im kinda at square one here. In my Unix experience, someone else wrote the makefile and it just worked.p  pI have downloaded the C source code for libtar1.2.11 from feep and ran codemakecode on it from inside of cygwin. This created a code.acode file and a code.execode file. The EXE file appears to essentially be tar to run on Windows, but what I wanted was for the libraries to read and process the file in my own code.p  pIf I remember correctly, those should be in the code.acode file archive and this needs to be linked into a library that I can use from my C program. So Im looking for a way to do that.p  pI am writing a library that will use a code.tgzcode file and so I want to use this library. I think Id like to turn libtar into a DLL as well as create a DLL myself for use in other languages.p  pSo, how do I turn my code.acode file into something usable by other apps, and how do I access it from inside my codep

Negative 43464 pWe have a WCF service with netTCPBinding hosted in a windows service, this service connects to ContentManager server to upload documents and add some metadata, retrieve the documentID and passes it to a .Net Application, the clients are authenticated using windows authentiation. We wrote a WCF client library to be used as a proxy by other line of business applications which wants to upload documents by just referencing this dll. All this works fine as long as the client apps are within the intranet domain.p  pNow there is a requirement to use this service by an web app accessed via mobile phones, the mobile application accesses a legacy asmx webservice which references the proxy to connect to the WCF service which in turn talks to another backend wcf service and uploads to content manager, the asmx webservice is hosted in servers outside of current domain in DMZ and there is no trust between the corporate domain and DMZ, we opened the necessary ports on both the servers, but since the client credentialtype is windows, it throws The remote server did not satisfy the mutual authentication requirement.  which is expected. Now we want to use the nettcpbinding for obvious reasons of performance since documents are scanned and sent via mobilephones from remote locations, and also with very little time rewriting this is not an option. In the articles i read and the discussions here most of them suggest against using netTCPBinding for this scenario, and a few tried and implemented this using certficates,p  pmy questions arep  ol liFor the scenarios i mentioned above does using Certficates to autheticate clients the right approachli liHow should i handle security, right now declarative impersonation is used on almost all operations, if i have to change security how can i do it without impacting other applications using the service.li ol  pI have not worked on certficates before so a guidance with respect to the scenario will also be of great help.p

Negative 43464 pI need some example Jython, or Java, code to exec an interactive OS shell binsh.  Our development environment is Java on Linux.  What I would like to do is provide a means for developers to write Jython scripts, and then drop into a shell, which allows them to inspect the system.  The reason I need to exec this from Jython or Javaas opposed to just wrapping all this in a shell scriptis that we use Java load some libraries which I need to keep loaded while the interactive shell is running.  If the JVM were to terminate before the interactive shell runs, some of our custom hardware would be reset.p  pI have looked at the Jython subprocess module.  However, most of what I have seen will only run and wait on a subrocess to terminate ie noninteractive.  None of the examples show how to the shell can be invoked interactively.

Negative 43464 pI would like to store groups of pages under different tags. So I create these modelsp  precodeclass Pagemodels.Model     title  models.CharFieldmaxlength50  class Tagmodels.Model     title  models.CharFieldmaxlength50     pages  models.ManyToManyFieldPage codepre  pI would then like to create a model formset that will allow me to edit the tag, and every page attached to that tag, as one big form. I believe this is what happens when you use Model Inline Formset, but that uses foreign keys. This is a reusable app, right now Im just rendering the form in a template, but I would prefer to use django forms so its easier to reuse.p  pI cant seem to figure out how this is done, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 43464 pI am trying to compile an application in C that works without the .net framework or visual studio run times having to be installed. I have done some research and found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms23563928vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowthis articlea from MSDN showing how to compile native C code. However when I followed this example, after running the generated executable on a computer without the visual studio run times, I get an error codeMSVCP100D.dllcode is missing from your computer. I know that it is possible to fix a similar error with GCC by typing codestaticlibgcc staticlibstdccode to generate a static binary. Is it possible to do this using Visual Studio 2010 The reason I wish to do this is that I enjoy working with Visual Studio IDE, but I would like my code to be portable to other OSs like UNIX. Thank youp  pNote I thought it might be helpful to post the code I am compiling for testing purposes.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt int main  stdcout ltlt Hello world  codepre

Negative 43464 pIm trying to figure out what the best way to handle a JSON object that I need to postget when the document is ready so I can then run over another function that builds out the DOM based on said JSON object. This object is also something that updates every 30 seconds to a minute.p  pMy initial thought was to build it out as a closure. IEp  precodevar myJSONobject  .posturi, functiondatareturn data codepre  phowever the function I run when the for document ready, and functions I base on click events dont recognize the object as being valid. It returns a JSON object, and Ive used jsonlint.com to confirm that the object format is valid. So I am thinking its in how I am handling the string of events. Where the object though it may be legit is being rendered after the document ready thus breaking the functionality in a sense. Cause if I take the same object it spits out and hardcode it in as a variable. the code ive been working on works fine. So now I am trying to figure out whats my best approach to handling this so one, my script doesnt break prematurely. and two find out if trying to adapt this as a closure the way I am is the right way Whats a good practice logic in this type of senario Should I load the JSON object into a hidden div somewhere or text area and pharse it through that or I dunno.p

I then tried to restart Tomcat and got an exception relating to the codecommonslogging.jarcode, which is a Tomcat dependency.p  pAfter a lot of frustration, I just downloaded a different version of Tomcat and tried running it right out of the box no configuration...and I got the same errorp  pSo I asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9673716tomcatversionsarentstartingthis questiona on SO a few days ago. The consensus was that my classpath had somehow gotten dirty, and now Im wondering if the codecatalina.batcode file I blindly copied over somehow set environmental variables that is affecting Tomcats ability to bootstrap  even across versions.p  pI know this question is similar to the other one I asked but is different. Whereas my first question was whats wrong here and was much more general, what I am asking now although related, is more specific and is about codecatalina.batcode and how it relates to Windows 7 environment variables.p  pThanks for any help here.p  pstrongEditstrong I see this question already has a closevote for being off topic. My argument against that is as follows SO is a programming QampA site for asking specific questions related to code and programming. codecatalina.batcode is a script, which is code, and this question concerns itself with a potential bugdefect in a script that I am using.p  pstrongEditstrong Found the line in codecatalina.batcode where the error message is coming from and, likewise, where Tomcat startup is dying from.

Negative 43464 pIm using Castle DynamicProxy with Autofac.

If I reverse the order of the arguments, the logging doesnt occur. p  pMy question, then registered in this way, are the interceptors guaranteed to execute in the same order every time Or is there a better way to ensure that the order will be what I intend every timep  pFWIW, I looked at the IInterceptorSelector interface. Perhaps Im missing somethingwhich is not unlikelybut it looked like that wasnt relevant in this case.

Negative 43464 pIm building a distributed web server in CMPI and it seems like pointtopoint communication completely stops working after the first MPIBARRIER in my code.  Standard C code works after the barrier, so I know that each of the threads makes it through the barrier.  Pointtopoint communication also works just fine before the barrier.  However, when I copypaste the same code that worked the line before the barrier into the line after the barrier it stops working entirely.  The SEND will just wait forever.  When I try using an ISEND instead, it makes it through the line, but the message is never received.  Ive been googling this problem a lot and everyone who has problems with MPIBARRIER is told the barrier works correctly and their code is wrong, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why my code is wrong.  What could be causing this behaviorp  pHere is a sample program that demonstrates thisp  precodeinclude ltmpi.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]    int procID   int val   MPIStatus status    MPIInitampargc, ampargv   MPICommrankMPICOMMWORLD, ampprocID   MPIBarrierMPICOMMWORLD    if procID  0        val  4     printfBefore sendn     MPISendampval, 1, MPIINT, 1, 4, MPICOMMWORLD     printfafter sendn       if procID  1        val  1     printfbefore val  dn, val     MPIRecvampval, 1, MPIINT, MPIANYSOURCE, MPIANYTAG, MPICOMMWORLD, ampstatus     printfafter val  dn, val       MPIFinalize   return 0  codepre  pMoving the two codeifcode statements before the barrier causes this program to run correctly.p  pstrongEDITstrong  It appears that the first communication, regardless of type, works, and all future communications fail.  This is much more general that I thought at first.  It doesnt matter if the first communication is a barrier or some other message, no future communications work properly.p

Negative 43464 pGood day,p  pI typically write rather simple BASH scripts on a routine basis. I can get the majority of my tasks done via codecutcode, codeechocode, codesedcode, and other commandline applications for parsing text, lists, etc.p  pI have a basic understanding of some simple regular expressions while using SED and VIM, but I am a complete stranger to AWK, and feel I should improve upon my understanding of regex.p  pCan anyone recommend any resources on this subject Most of my Google searches have been fruitless or are mainly a few existing examples. My primary concern is gaining a solid generalized grasp of regex which I can then focus on SED, VIM, and AWK. I have already Googled a number of books on the topic, but they all seem to be focused on the insandouts of the specific application with minimal emphasis on regex, while the books I find on regex seem to have no mention of SED or VIM, and instead focus on Perl, Python, and Ruby.p  pThe endgoal is that I would like to be able to come up with oneliners like one other generous poster created in a previous question of mine at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11587919sedonelinerfinddelimiterpairsurroundingkeyword1158834511588345sed oneliner  Find delimiter pair surrounding keyworda , or even more complex than that.p  pAny material would be helpful.

Negative 43464 pSay I have a form that has fields to gather data about future conferences not the real domain but will suffice for the purposes of this question. Part of the validation is that a new event can only happen once in that year so for instance if you have a stackoverflow getmessyandrunk conference that happens in 2012  the user shouldnt be allowed to enter a new event with the same name and year...p  pNow  what I have tried so far is to add a remote validator to each of the fieldsp  pone for the event name field that uses the AdditionalFields property to include the year field and one for the year field which uses the AdditionalFields to include the event name field. p  pit doesnt work  if I try to add an event with the same name and year it adds an error to just the year field, correcting it fixes it, then trying again it adds an error to the name field and year field, correcting the name field to make the combination unique only removes the error from the name field  it goes on like this...p  pHow are others doing thisp

I need to do the communication with codeHttpWebRequestcode because I need to modify headers etc.p  pWhat I want to do is the followingp  ol liA button is clicked. LoginUsername is provided to lets say my communication layer. For example codeLoginRequeststring username, string pwdcodeli liThe comm. layer will execute the request and obtain the answer asynchronously, i.e. calling the callback codeLoginResponseCallbackIAsyncResult rescodeli liOkay, now I can handle the response, deserialize my retrieved JSON string into an objectli liThe object should be handed back to the UI to update the data. I know that I should use the codeDispatcher.BeginInvokecode method because the callback is not running on the UI thread.li ol  pBut I still dont know how I can pass the object from my communication layer to the UI. I think the solution is very straightforward, like passing a delegate from the codebtnLoginonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs ecode to the codeLoginRequestcodemethod. Or maybe I need to work with lambdasp  pI have a codeSendBasicRequestcode method in my communication layer, which sets the appropriate headers e.g. ClientOS, LoginKey, VersionBuild etc. I want to call this method from several pages, so I want it to be decoupled in the communication layer.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 43464 pIm writing a small website which has several pages that are very similar. Most of the time, only the content of one div is different. The navigation, header etc stays the same. p  pSo I realized this with a base html file, some smaller htmlfiles with only a contentdiv and javascript code like this which is triggered by a button click eventp  precode.getcontenttext1.html, functiondata      content.htmldata  codepre  pThis works very smooth but the problem was, that the url in the addressbar doesnt change with those kind of requests.

Negative 43464 pThe DataGrid Edit Data feature works fine when editing values where there are more than one row. In this case, the results appear in a table and each rows cell can be edited.

If I use bg command to resume it, it will again be stopped by a SIGTTIN.p  pWhat I am confused is how could I implement this. Is SIGTTIN automatically sent by the OS, or I have to send it myself If it is that latter one, how could I tell a child is going to read from the terminal or notp  pThanksp

Negative 43464 pIm currently editing a .html file with telerik radtooltips hooked up to a mapped image. Basically there are small blocks on the image that have been set to fire the radtooltips on mouse over. The html file is ran inside of a .aspx file and it inherits the telerik namespace. However, I cannot set attributes in the radtooltips and it instead defaults to a really ugly default style that I can no longer change. Ive also tried setting up divs and tables inside the tool tip however, the tooltip container isnt affected so you get a nasty yellow border from the tooltip around whatever definitions are setup for the table or div.

If the row is one then I want the card size to be large, if it is 2 then set the card size smaller. I can achieve this in separate projects, but I want the result I cannot upload the images to show hw the result should look like in the same project. p  pPlease help me as this is achieved using renderscript, and I have little knowledge on rendescript.

The lost functions seem to be quite random, sometimes a single one is missing, sometimes several in a row. Also there are functions between the missing ones that are shown in the outline like this shown, shown, missing, shown, missing, missing, ...br I double checked that every single function has the codememberOfcode jsDoc annotation which should make it visible in the outline.br The missing functions are not recognized as function blocks by the editor so I cannot fold them the shown function can be folded. Removing the content from the codecalcGridLocationcode function enables code folding on the codedetectCollisioncode function.p

Negative 43464 pIm using Ninject 3.0.1.10 and ninject.extensions.factory 3.0.1.0 from NuGet  in the real scenario Ill be using ninject.extensions.conventions as well rather than manually binding IFoo, but I wanted to keep that out of this to try and simplify the question.p  pI have an IFoo interface and multiple implementations of it, with each under a child namespace and subfolder called Gen1 and Gen2.  I have an IFooFactory interface where the intent is that it returns an IFoo based on a specified parameter string, enum, whatever.  p  pI use an enum in this example simply to try and make it more clear  I had made a string version at first, but felt like the objections around passing a more arbitrary parameter like a string would just confuse the issue.p  precodepublic enum ImplementationGeneration      Gen1,     Gen2,     Gen3,   public interface IFoo      void DoStuff   public interface IFooFactory      IFoo CreateFooImplementationGeneration implementationGeneration    namespace SomeRootNamespace.Gen1      public class Foo  IFoo              public void DoStuff                      Console.WriteLineDoing Type1 stuff                 namespace SomeRootNamespace.Gen2      public class Foo  IFoo              public void DoStuff                      Console.WriteLineDoing Type2 stuff                codepre  pNow, I understand that having the consumer choose the implementation like this is a form of coupling that would ideally not exist, but IMHO its the same level of coupling as named bindings, which Ninject already supports.  I wanted to avoid adding the attributes to the implementations, and having GetGen1  GetGen2  etc methods in the factory interface is a painful fit for this, since Id end up violating OCP via a switch somewhere to map input to the method to call or manually using reflectionp  pThe completeworking code I have now that Id rather avoid if possible is here a hrefhttpsgist.github.com4549677 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com4549677ap  pIt uses 2 approachesp  ol lia manual factory implementation that violates OCP with a switch on the enum passed  li liusing the factory extension with an instance of IInstanceProvider subclasses StandardInstanceProvider to override GetInstance.li ol  pThe second approach seems like it might be close to the right way to get this working, but 1 it keeps around a reference to the kernel in order to do its work, which is probably a bad idea and 2 since I couldnt find the concrete type in the bindings for IFoo when searching on all the IFoo bindings during the call, it currently does a GetAll, so it instantiates N1 more instances than it needs to for this scenario.p

Negative 43464 pI have 10 sets of points which I call templates that I have manually classified from 0 to 10. Each point is a X, Y coordinate in a text file. Each template has 58 points. I have new sets of points that I want to classify as one of the templates. The points are scale and rotation invariant. Each set of points may not have the same number of points with the template that it corresponds to. theres also differences in the X,Y coordinates meaning theyre not identical but they are similar. So I think what I need is the closest set of points from the templates to another set of points the one I have as input.p  pI can generate polygons from each set of points so the question can become how can I match the closest polygon to a set of points.p  pMaybe generate some signature and grade the set of points against each of the templatesp

Note that this function becomes a bit harder when universal variables are involved.p  pFor example, the function given the expression codeforall y exist x p x ycode turns it into codeforall y p sf666 y ycode. The idea is that the existencial variable tells me that there is something that satisfies the formulae.

Negative 43464 pDont get me wrong. I am searching for this answer quite some time. And frankly speaking I could not get a satisfying answer anywhere. In a lot of places  Its mentioned that MI poses the following problem big time. I have two classes A and B, and one class C is inherited from both A and B, and both A,B declares a method , say fooint i, and I forget to declare a fooint i in the C class, then compiler does not know which fooint to call when i issue something like this  p  precodeC c  new C c.fooi codepre  pBut can we overcome in case we use multiple interfaces instead of inheritance through multiple classes Do we call implementation of multiple interfaces as multiple inheritance How the above problem is handled by compiler if i use multiple interfacesp  palso, regarding  when should i use an interface and when should i do the same through abstract class  Does that only depend on such a thought that  p  pIf the requirement changes a lot and quite often, then I will implement the same using interfaces and otherwise abstract classes would be my choice I want to know are there any other reason that anyone wants to mention. These are pretty basic concepts of the OOO and I think Im missing something to get a considerable progress in my learning the same. Sorry to make this question a bit long.p

Negative 43464 pI assume that this question has been addressed somewhere, but I have spent an inordinate amount of time looking around for the answer including digging into the source code a bit.  I have tried to put the problem in the first paragraph.  The rest shows a basic example of the problem.p  pI am attempting to compile a module that contains a codeUSEcode statement pointing to another, more general, module.  I would prefer to keep the used module separate so that it can be used in several packages as a set of general settings.  When I compile the two modules using f2py everything works as advertised from the fortran side, but from the python side codeUSEcode appears to be ignored.  If I allow f2py to generate a signature file, the file contains a codeUSEcode statement as is appropriate, but if I complete the compilation and import from the resulting library the parameters from the used module are not available in the module that contains the use statement.  Below are two modules illustrating the situationp  precodeMODULE test     INTEGER, PARAMETER  a  1 END MODULE test  MODULE test2     USE test     INTEGER, PARAMETER  b  2 END MODULE test2 codepre  pIn order to show the intermediate step I ran codef2py h test.pyf test.f90 test2.f90code.  The following signature file is generated note that the test2 module contains use testp  precode     f90   Note the context of this file is case sensitive.  python module test  in     interface   in test         module test  in testtest.f90             integer, parameter,optional  a1         end module test         module test2  in testtest2.f90             use test             integer, parameter,optional  b2         end module test2     end interface end python module test   This file was autogenerated with f2py version2.

Negative 43464 pIve been using Inno Setup to check for and install the .NET 2.0 framework for one of my applications.  Its worked pretty faultessly by checking for a Registry Key and simply downloading the .NET installer and installing prior to installing my application.p  pFrom what I understand this isnt working in Windows 8.   Windows 8 bundles .NET 2.0 in the .NET 3.5 package which is enabled via the W8 Install Windows Features applet thingamy.

Negative 43464 pCould anyone guide me to a suitable tool to debug a C program Its not a simple one and part of a big project. The problem is that I have an array of structures and it is initialised properly. I could check the values using gdb. After the program runs, somewhere the array contents are being overwritten. I am not sure which process is overwriting the contents of this array of structures. Any tool or even a technique within gdb to track this problem Cant do watchpoint from gdb because it cant watch a constant value. Tried valgrind, but doesnt show any memory related issues. Any help, really appreciated. thanks, badri.p

Negative 43464 pCertain foundation classes such as NSString or NSArray have instance methods that do something with that instance, but never ask for the instance to be given to then. For examplep  pNSArray array  [hi]p  pInt number  [array count]p  pThe count method knows which array to count without asking for one to be provided. How so you do that  Im looking to make a category on NSString with an incrementByOne instance method. I dont want to ask for the string in the method deceleration, I want to know what object Im performing the action on, just like count knows which array to work on. If anyone can help me out, I would greatly appreciate it. p
Negative 43464 pI have a Window where I want to shut down the app if the user press the red XClose button. For this, I handle the emClosingem event and make codeEnvironment.Exit0codep  pIf the user ends working with the Window and clicks Accept I want to close it, but if I make codethis.Closecode, this will trigger the emClosingem event and shut down the whole App.p  pI tried to check the emsenderem param of the event with the debugger but its the Window object in both cases. Is there a way to check the source element of the Event triggerp  pI could use a flag, setting it to true when the user clicks Accept and dont make the codeEnvironment.Exit0code when its true, but I dont think this is a clean solution.p

Negative 43464 pIm fairly new to Java and Im having trouble exporting my application into a runnable jar.  My application runs some transformations using Saxon and I want the stylesheets used to be inside the runnable jar. p  pRight now I simply have a subfolder in my project in eclipse and Im accessing the stylesheets with that path.  However as soon as I export the project as runnable jar inside that jar all the stylesheets are on the same level as the used libraries subfolder is nowhere to be found.p  pAlso the application searches for that subfolder in the cwd and of course cant find it there. p  pHow do I pack the stylesheets and access them properly inside the jar p  pUpdatep  pI think Im a little further. p  pIve created a subfolder under src and put all stylesheets in there. Im accessing them like sop  precodexsltexps  comp.compilenew StreamSourcenew Filethis.getClass.getResourcestylesheets  stylesheets.toURI codepre  pIf i run it in eclipse everything works fine.

Negative 43464 pKind of a complicated question that I cant properly summarize in the title.p  pI have a 64 bit process Foo64 that creates a 32 bit child process Bar32, then tries to get the full path of Bar32s version of kernel32.dll. Obviously I expect Bar32 to have loaded it from CWindowsSysWow64kernel32.dllp  pOn Windows 7, I call GetModuleFileNameExA from Foo64, and correctly get CWindowsSysWow64Kernel32.dll back.p  pOn Windows Server 2012, the exact same code gives me back cWindowssystem32kernel32.dll, which is the 64bit dll location. Its obviously not possible for Bar32 to have loaded a 64 bit dll.p  pMy hunch is that Server 2012 is telling me the location of where Bar32 tried to load it from, rather than the actual redirected location. How can I get it to tell me the true locationp  pIs there something fundamental Im misunderstandingp  pI have read all of the relevant MSDN pages, and the first three pages of all relevant google searches.p

And being able to simply refer to a Cassandra table directly from hive without having to explicitly define an external table is great.p  pHowever, the INSERT operation is taking 34 times longer than other common hadoop stacks.

Also, the write requests all are going to the same node, with none going to the other nodes.p  pMy assumption is that hive would distribute push down the work to each node, which it appears to do with the common hadoop stacks.p  pOtherwise, the key is random, and the data load grows in a balanced manner across the nodes.

Negative 43464 pIve recently started to play around with OpenMP and like it very much.p  pI am a justforfun ClassicVB programmer and like coding functions for my VB programs in C. As such, I use Windows 7 x64 and GCC 4.7.2. I usually set up all my C functions in one large C file and then compile a DLL out of it. Now I would like to use OpenMP in my DLL.p  pFirst of all, I set up a simple example and compiled an exe file from itp  precodeinclude ltomp.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid      int n  520000     int i     int a[n]     int NumThreads      ompsetnumthreads4      pragma omp parallel for     for i  0 i lt n i              a[i]  2  i         NumThreads  ompgetnumthreads           printfValue  d.n, a[77]     printfNumber of threads  d., NumThreads     return0  codepre  pI compile that using codegcc fopenmp MyC.c o MyC.execode and it works like a charm.p  pHowever, when I try to use OpenMP in my DLL, it fails. For example, I set up this functionp  precodedeclspecdllexport int stdcall TestAdd3istruct SAFEARRAY InArr1, struct SAFEARRAY InArr2, struct SAFEARRAY OutArr OpenMP Test      int LengthArr     int i     int InArrElements1     int InArrElements2     int OutArrElements      LengthArr  InArr1gtrgsabound[0].cElements      InArrElements1  int InArr1.pvData     InArrElements2  int InArr2.pvData     OutArrElements  int OutArr.pvData      ompsetnumthreads4      pragma omp parallel for privatei     for i  0 i lt LengthArr i              OutArrElements[i]  InArrElements1[i]  InArrElements2[i]           returnompgetnumthreads  codepre  pThe structs are defined, of course. I compile that usingp  precodegcc fopenmp c DBUILDDLL dll.c o dll.o gcc fopenmp shared o mydll.dll dll.o lgomp Wl,addstdcallalias codepre  pThe compiler and linker do not complain not even warnings come up and the dll file is actually being built. But as I try to call the function from within VB, the VB compiler claims the the DLL file could not be found runtime error 53. The strange thing about that is that as soon as one single OpenMP command is present inside the .c file, the VB compiler claims a missing DLL even if I call a function that does not even contain a single line of OpenMP code. When I comment all OpenMP stuff out, the function works as expected, but doesnt use OpenMP for parallelization, of course.p  pWhat is wrong here Any help appreciated, thanks in advance p

Negative 43464 pIam creating an Android app using Xamarin with the MVVMCross Framework.p  pInside my PCLportable class library,I want to implement an FTP Client Class where I can read files from a specific FTP Folder in an FTP Server hosted in IIS and based on some business rules, to download the files one by one. The download part might not be an issue since I can use the WebRequest and WebResponse classes of the System.Net namespace. p  pMy main issue is that I want to find a way to read the files from the FTP Folder. I cannot use Directory.GetFiles method since it is not supported by the System.IO in PCL, for cross platform compatibility reasons. p  pI also want to avoid creating my FTPClient class inside my droidUI GUI project where I have access to all the classes of the Framework because then I will ruin my MVVM multilayer architecture. p  pI hope the above makes some sense to what iam trying to say. p  pThanks in advance.p

I want to add a button per row, called codeAcceptcode, which should set codeIsAccepted  1code on the SQL row.p  pIve managed to add an codeAcceptcode button per row as followsp  precode echo thisgtHtmlgtlinkAccept, arrayaction gt accept, product[Product][ID] codepre  pBut the code in codeProductController.phpcode does not workp  precode public function acceptid  null      ...      thisgtProductgtIsAccepted  1  does not work, silently fails   codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong How do I properly edit a row using a perrow buttonp
Negative 43464 pLets say I have 3 images, each a placeholder for a Flash animation. When I click an image I want it to be replaced by its corresponding SWF. When I click another image I want the current SWF to be replaced by its placeholder image, and the newly clicked image to be replaced by its SWF.p  pIm thinking of using the data attribute on the images to hold the path to the SWFbut this doesnt seem like the cleanest way to accomplish what I want.p
Negative 43464 pI was asked to create 512 bit integer type to my RSA encryption algorithm. I started from the simplest bitwise operations codeOR, AND, XOR, NOTcode, afterwards using mentioned operations I implemented addition, subtraction etc. Unfortunately after many tests, its very slow on more than 128 bits. p  pI was surprised when I found site with RSA generation where it generated key using apparently javascript in several miliseconds. How I can improve my algorithm to get better efficiency  Or better question would be how proffesionals implement so big types with such performance.p  pHere is my codep  precode    public class BigInt

Negative 43464 pI have a bespoke CMS that needs to be searchable in Solr. Currently, I am using Nutch to crawl the pages based on a seed list generated from the CMS itself.p  pI need to be able to add metadata stored in the CMS database to the document indexed in Solr. So, the thought here is that the page text html generated by the CMS is crawled via Nutch and the metadata is added to the Solr document where the unique ID in this instance, the URL is the same.p  pAs such, the metadata from the DB can be used for facets  filtering etc while fulltext search and ranking is handled via the document added by Nutch.p  pIs this pattern possible Is there any way to update the fields expected from the CMS DB after  Nutch has added it to Solrp

Negative 43464 pIve looked around and havent found a preexisting answer to this question.p  h2Infoh2  pMy site relies on Ajax, Apache, Mysql, and PHP.p  pI have already built my site and it works well however as soon as too many users begin to connect when receiving roughly 200 requests per second the server performs very poorly.p  pThis site is very reliant on ajax. The main page of the site performs an ajax request every second so if 100 people are online, Im receiving at least 100 requests per second.p  pThese ajax queries invoke mysql queries on the serverside.

Heres the codep  precodepublic void SortMethodnbrs  int nbrs[] int v[]  public void sort      this.nbrs  nbrs     this.vv      for int i  0 i lt 10 i          int min  Integer.MINVALUE         int minIndex  1         for int k  i k lt 10 k              if nbrs[k] lt min                  min  nbrs[k]                 minIndex  k                               v[minIndex]  v[i]         v[i]  min         codepre  pAnd in another project I havep  precodepublic class Vector  public static void mainString[] args      int nbrs[]  2, 4, 67, 40, 32, 28, 9, 8, 55, 72       nbrs.sort      forint j  0 jlt10 j         System.out.printlnnbrs[j]        codepre  pIn the sorting method I get errors at the void part inp  precodepublic void SortMethodnbrs  codepre  pat the void saying that  is expected, and Syntax error, insert Interfaceidentifier to complete InterfaceHeader.p  pAlso I get error atp  precodenbrs.sort codepre  pIn the Vector class.p  pAny help is appreciated. p

Negative 43464 pI was hoping someone could help me answer a couple of questions regarding Tableau. I am not as familiar with the platform, but I have a client who is looking for a reportinganalyticsdata visualization platform that they could use for many of the internal apps for their employees and external customer facing internet with login applications. p  pThe driver is that each of their internal teams has used many disparate technologies such as SSRS, Crystal, custom ASP.NET controls KendoTelerik, etc, but now they have the opportunity to choose a common platform that could serve mostall of the future reporting and data visualization needs for enterprise and customer facing solutions.p  pThey are looking for a platform that provides everything from simple grids with basic filtersortgroup, all the way to rich charting and adhoc reporting with slicing and dicing of data.p  pThey will not always be creating dashboards in these apps since they are customerfacing, but they may want to have dashboards for internal intranet apps. They will definitely want the ability to build true internal BI dashboards to report on data from all these online apps across all customers, to whom they provide their SaaScustomerfacing web apps.p  pOne of our main concerns revolves around security of data, as some of these customerfacing web apps are multitenant, so wed need to ensure that data is always filtered by the client tenant id.  Also we have a very customized security model, with data driven roles, permissions that may prevent showing certain types of data e.g. SSN, Salary, etc etc.p  pstrongDoes Tableau fits this model, can it meet mostall of these requirements, or is it meant more for internal datastrong p
Negative 43464 pI downloaded Google a hrefhttpsgithub.comGoogleChromechromeappsamplestreemasterpushsampleapp relnofollowpushsampleapp codea, removed the key from the manifest, uploaded the app to the Chrome Web Store, then installed it in Chrome from the Web Store.p  pNow strongchromeextensionsstrong lists the app as Enabled, with emInspect views background page Inactiveem. Chrome Task Manager doesnt list the app as currently running.p  pIf at strongchromeextensionsstrong tab, I click embackground page Inactiveem link for Push Messaging Sample app, then an inspect view shows up in a separate Chrome window, and a new entry appears in the Chrome Task Manager emBackground Page Push Messaging Sampleem. As long as an inspect view Chrome window is open, an event page background.js doesnt get offloaded. And When a message is sent to the push messaging service, a popup window with the message text appears.p  pIf I close the inspect view Chrome window, and send a message to the push messaging service, Chrome Task Manager shows that an event page background.js gets loaded, then offloaded in a few seconds disappearing from the Task manager. However, a popup window with a message does not appear.p  pHow this app needs to be changed to show popup messages without any extra Chrome windows runningp

Negative 43464 pIm looking to call up a random codeCCPointcode from codeCCArraycode, and then remove that point from the array so that its not called up again. This is the code I usedp  precode    myArraygtaddObjectpos1 codepre  pWhere codepos1code is a codeCCPointcode and codemyArraycode is a codeCCArraycode. When I write that line, it brings up an error that reads No viable conversion from cocos2dCCPoint to cocos2dCCObject . I know this means that codeCCPointcode doesnt inherit from codeCCObjectcode, but just making it inherit CCObject doesnt help the problem. Ive also tried typecasting codepos1code as well but that doesnt work either. What do you suggest I do so that I can keep an array of points Thanks in advance. p

Negative 43464 pGiven an Integer set, x  1 lt x lt n. Consider a combination, something like 50C6 select 6 from 50.

Given k, Id like the algorithm to give the combination.p  precode Select r from c and return combination k. public static int[] comboint c, int r, int k   codepre  pFor example, combo3,2,1 should return 1,2 and combo3,2,3 should return 2,3 assuming the first combination is 1 and not 0  but thats trivial.  p  pDoing this in OnCr is easy and takes little memory...

Negative 43464 pIm running into a problem with the autolayout for my detail view in a codeUISplitViewControllercode. My view hierarchy contains a codeUIImageViewcode with a decorative element, and the image views intrinsic size seems to be screwing up the layout of the rest of the controls.p  pThese are the constraints I have specified for the image viewp  precodeH[UIImageView0xc83ba90]NSSpace20 HNSSpace20[UIImageView0xc83ba90] UIImageView0xc83ba90.bottom  UITextField0xc83d2d0.bottom V[UIImageView0xc83ba90 3]gt, H[UIImageView0xc83ba90 532] Hug1 CompressionResistance750 V[UIImageView0xc83ba90 2] Hug250 CompressionResistance750 codepre  pThe behavior I want is for the image view to be resized to fill its superview, as described by the top two constraints. The actual behavior Im seeing is that the image view only takes up horizontal space described by its intrinsic size constraint. It also seems to be altering the layout of all of its sibling views, as though the superview were only laying out views in a rectangle as wide as the image view.p  pI thought that specifying the hugging priority of the image view as low as possible would let the other constraints override it to resize the image view. What am I doing wrong herep

Negative 43464 pI am coding a simple shell program but unsure of what happens to the file descriptor table after dup2 and execvp. So I have a parent process waiting for child process to endwaitpid but when it loops back to wait for the next user input, how come does the file descriptor table I modified using dup2 in child process not persist in the parent process Is it because execvp resets the file descriptor table back to the original  p  pEDIT I figured it out. The fork function actually makes a separate copy of the program image, including file descriptor table so the parent processs fd table is unaffected. p

Negative 43464 pIm working on this project where I need Location updates plus data uploads even when the main Application is not in the foreground. Im thinking of placing all location and networking functions in a Service XService, for arguments sake and communicate between the Activity Main and XService using broadcasts within the same process no access for other apps.p  pI have not yet written the code, but the work flow goes something like p  blockquote   pbr 1. Main  Start. In onCreate, start a new Thread, and on it   instantiate and bind XService. br 2. Main  Login screen. Get data,   package it in an Intent and broadcast to XService. br 3. XService    Receive broadcast, unpack intent. Setup socket and data streams. Setup   LocationManager for updates. Broadcast to Main that the network is   ready. Upload data every time LocationManager updates. br   4. Main  Upon receiving the networkready broadcast, prepare Intent for initialization and broadcast. br 5. XService  Receive   initializationrequest broadcast, unpack, perform network task,   broadcast response. br 6. Repeat emad nauseamem as per user   interaction and any timed updates. br x. Main  On logout,   broadcast to XService. br x1. XService  Send logout info to   server, close sockets, broadcast to Main that it is exiting   gracefully, then stopSelf. br x2 Main  Complete logout   procedure.p blockquote  pMy main question is  is this the right way of going about it p  pAnother question is What happens when XService broadcasts a Location update to Main, but Main is stopped i.e. not running in foreground I assume that since the BroadcastReceiver on Main is not instantiated due to Main being in a stopped state, the broadcast essentially does nothing. How does this unreceived broadcast impact or not, as the case may be XService or the process  device in generalp

If a cache object already exists then I dont need to do the redirect because the variables are set immediately.p  pAs my entire app relies on this thirdparty API Im doing a lot of caching in Memcache and for the most part the app is behaving just normally with this redirect however Ive hit an issue with a redirect loop when CakePHP is unable to set the cached object in Memcache as it simply runs through the code on each redirect with the same results.p  pHere is some code so you can better understand what is happening.p  pIn my Categories controller I have the following view methodp  precodepublic function viewcid, loc, page      catCache  Cachereadsearchview.cid..loc..page     if catCache          url  Routerurl             array                 controller gt Categories,                 action gt saveCats,                 page                               thisgtrequestActionurl         thisgtredirect          thisgtsetview, catCache  codepre  pThis checks to see if a Memcache object already exists and if not I do a codethisgtrequestActioncode on the API method called codesaveCatscode that creates the cached object for me. Once this action has been performed I have to then call the redirect otherwise the codeviewcode variable data is empty. This is what that codesaveCatscode method looks likep  precodepublic function saveCatspage  null      if isnullpage page  0      cid  thisgtrequestgtdata[Cat][category]     loc  thisgtrequestgtdata[Cat][region]      address   httpapi.url.com.cid     options  array         CURLOPTPOST gt false,         CURLOPTURL gt address,         CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER gt true,         CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER gt false,         CURLOPTHTTPAUTH gt CURLAUTHDIGEST,         CURLOPTUSERPWD gt usernamepassword           ch  curlinit     curlsetoptarraych, options      content  curlexecch      doc  new DOMDocument      filename  content     docgtloadXMLfilename      i  0     while isobjectview  docgtgetElementsByTagNamecategorygtitemi          foreach viewgtchildNodes as nodename              if nodenamegtnodeNamecategorytitle                  thisgtrequestgtdata[Browse][i][title]  hnodenamegtnodeValue                          if nodenamegtnodeNamecategorydescription                  thisgtrequestgtdata[Browse][i][description]  hnodenamegtnodeValue                               i           Cachewritesearchview.cid..loc..page, thisgtrequestgtdata[Browse], 2 hours     curlclosech  codepre  pFinally, just for clarity sake, here is the codeview.ctpcode file that renders the content.p  precodelttable border0 cellspacing0 cellpadding0 summarycattablegt     lttbodygt     ltphp foreach view as cat gt         lttrgt             lttdgtltphp echo hcat[title] gtlttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgtltphp echo hcat[description] gtlttdgt         lttrgt     ltphp endforeach gt     lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pI essentially have two core issues here. The first is that I cannot understand what Im doing wrong that forces me to have to use the codethisgtredirectcode in order for CakePHP to set the codeviewcode variable correctly.p  pThe second issue I have is the redirect loop issue which I could totally avoid if I didnt have to force this redirect. Ive read some methods around potentially overcoming this using JavaScript however for this project Im using absolutely zero JavaScript because its targeted to devices that do not support JavaScript.p  pAny help on the above two issues is greatly appreciated.p
Negative 43464 pInteresting behavior in SSIS.  I have a dtsx package developed in 2005.  One of the Execute SQL tasks have a CTE statement.  It is the only statement in the block.  When I debugged the package in 2005 everything worked fine.  However when I ran the package as a job after deploying to a server, I got an error stating that there was incorrect syntax near the keyword with.  p  pIt worked fine however when I put a semicolon just before the with statement.  Now I know that previous statements before a CTE need to be terminated with a semi colon and Ive got into the habit of always terminating all of my statements anyway... but there were no statements before this CTE.  I even checked any other execute SQL tasks that might have run before and all the statements are properly terminated.  This was a 2005 package running in SQL 2008R2.p  pSo its working fine now but Im still left puzzled as to why this happens.  Does anyone have any ideasp

Negative 43464 pI want to have multiple large lists essentially queues of tasks stored in Firebase and have a client process monitoring them. Ideally, Id want to be able to use a transaction to move tasks between the lists. The easy first approach was to keep separate lists of tasks and run a transaction on a common ancestor node.p  pstrongQ1strong. Does this transaction end up fetching all of the data under the common ancestor every time the transaction is runp  pIf so, my first approach seems wasteful if the lists are large and we have to do the transaction repeatedly. My next idea was to hold multiple lists under a single node, but have the priorities act as tags for which list they belong in. Thus you can query for a specific priority tag, and move tasks between lists by just changing the priority.p  pstrongQ2strong.

Negative 43464 pI have an HTML file with multiple GIF images referenced inside it.

Negative 43464 pI am working on an application with Entity Framework current version 6.1.1 Databasefirst and Sql Express 2008 as a storage. I have a very simple model that consists of two tables Foo and FooElements with onetomany relations. p  pI have deleted column Bla from table Foo, opened my .edmx file, rightclicked an empty space and selected Update model from the database, but the deleted field remained in the model. p  pWhen I try getting the Foo entities from the DB, an exception is thrown Invalid column name Bla. So I deleted the whole Foo entity from the model, added it from the DB again, now I have another exception  property Bla does not exist.p  pI tried restarting Visual Studio, removing obj and bin files, removing the data model from the project completely and creating it from scratch  it requires property Bla in the model, but fails when I create it manually column Bla is not created automatically hence the column does not exist in the DB.p  pThe only solution to make my project running again is to create column Bla in the DB again and leave it there, despite the fact that I dont need it.p  pIs there any way to delete a column from a DB so that the Entity framework can work afterwards Is there any kind of cache file that I have to clean up Thank you.p  pP.S. Even thought the field does not exist in the edmx file, Entity framework still thinks it is required. Where can it get an idea, that there are still certain fields in the DBp

Negative 43464 pOverview I am trying to make a script that will take a list of machines and manually update their etcshadow files with a new root passwd. I know this isnt the best method but my boss wants this process automated. we are using a application called puppet for 90 of the update but some machines failed the update or cant have puppet installed, hence this dodgy fix. sorry for any stupid errors its only my 3rd week using any unix product, I have been a windows admin my whole lifep  pIssue I need to ssh into the PCs update the etcshadow file but only change the root user not all systems have the same users and I dont want to remove any of those users in the process I have gotten as far as being able to extract the current user in line 1 through ssh, then check if that user is indeed the root user but I am stuck on then updating the etcshadow file on the new machine as my boss has asked that the following standards happen.p  pI cant have any real user interaction in the script, so no manually typing the new passwd. I am not allowed to have the new passwd displayed anywhere in clear text inside the script or in another filep  pOk hopefully thats enough info onto the code.p  precoderootuser  unknownunknown.txt  filelinescat unknown  prodnewshadow  ohfoptiononeholdingfile  pelproderrorlog   for line in filelines  do  echo Attempting to fix line please wait  ssh oBatchModeyes l user line awk if NR1 print 0 etcshadow gtgt ohf           if grep q root ohf  then  echo root user located updating to produtcion password    This is the line that doesnt work  ssh oBatchModeyes l user line sed i 1s.prod etcshadow  else      echo unable to find root user this will require a manual fix this server will be listed in  the proderrorlog file  echo line gtgt pel  fi        done  codepre  pThe line in bold the sed line doesnt work I know why it doesnt work but I have no idea how to fix it at all, thank you to anyone who takes the time to look at this, I know the codes a bit of a mess, please forgive me.p

Negative 43464 pIn the past with JS transitions, one could specify some behavior to happen after the transition, via a callback. E.g.p  precodejQuery function hideTheContent      content.fadeOut1000,function        mandatoryLogicAfterHidingContent       codepre  pNow with CSS3 transitions, we can do something like this.p  precodeCSS content    opacity1   transition opacity 1s   .hidden    opacity0   transition opacity 1s   jQuery function hideTheContent      content.addClasshidden      still need to run mandatoryLogicAfterHidingContent  codepre  pI know of the new transitionend events, so hypothetically we could do something like thisp  precodejQuery function hideTheContent      content.ontransitionend, functione        mandatoryLogicAfterHidingContent           content.addClasshidden  codepre  pbut since were now separating out the JS from the UI, its possible that someone else could come along with a new UI where contenthiding is instant, remove the CSS3 transition, and inadvertently break the JS call to mandatoryLogicAfterHidingContent.p  pAnother scenario, say I have a box and theres a reset function that resizes said box to size 50x50 with transition, then calls a mandatoryLogicAfterResize. If I call the reset fn twice, I dont think the transition event is guaranteed to fire in this case  but I still need mandatoryLogicAfterResize to run both times.p  pIn more complex codebases, I also worry about other transitions getting called before the specific transition Im targeting. and prematurely triggering the mandatoryLogic. I guess the core problem here is, with CSS3 transitions, how can I defensively tie the mandatoryLogicAfterHidingContent event handler with emmyem and only my invocation of codeaddClasshiddencode, like I could with the jQuery callbackp

Negative 43464 pI am having a bit of trouble preventing a div flash where react will render the error message then receive props and finally render the props.p  pIn my codeEventsViewcode component I have the following.p  pemview.jsemp  precodevar view if .sizethis.props.events  0  view   this.props.events.mapfunctionyear                  return ltYearView yearyear gt           else      view  ltNoEventsView gt  codepre  pSo the variable codeviewcode is rendered, initially there is no codethis.props.eventscode on page load as I have another part of the file creating it. The moment this.props.events is created the events are rendered. This is done throught a codereact.Backbonecode mixin.p  pI have tried doing something used some of the component lifecycle methods such as codecomponentWillUpdatecode. The problem is they dont seem to want to work the way I want them to work and the error message is never rendered. Example of what I have tried among others belowp  pI thought of doing something like this.p  pemview.jsemp  precodecomponentWillUpdate functionnextprops, nextstate  if .sizenextprops.events  0      var view   nextprops.events.mapfunctionyear                      return ltYearView yearyear gt                  this.setState         view view       else      this.setState         view ltNoEventsView gt       ,   render this.state.view codepre  pI would then set the codegetInitialStateviewcode to the a codethis.props.eventscode map.p  pstrongEDIT  A temporary and terrible workaround strongp  pSo the problem I was having was I had a top level component accepting a single prop which was a global variable like sop  pemview.jsemp  precodeReact.renderltEventsView eventstheseEvents gt, document.getElementByIdmainContent codepre  pcodetheseEventscode is actually a Backbone Collection global variable initialized in another file.p  pOn document load codetheseEventscode would be unpopulated so my view would flash with the codeltNoEventView gtcode and then rerender when codetheseEventscode is then populated. This is handled by the backbone mixin shown below.p  pDans solution pointed me in the right direction. I set a global variable codewindow.hasEventscode to true or false depending on what I got back from my ajax request but by that time React was already rendering the component would start as codehasEventscode would be true, by the time its finished codehasEventscode might be false. Even if I made codehasEventscode a prop of codeltEventsView gtcode react wouldnt rerender when it changed. p  pSo as a temporary workaround I have defaulted codehasEventscode to true and rendered codeEventsViewcode. I then waited for the component to load and checked whether it was in sync with hasEvents. shown below. Honestly this workaround is not very pleasant.p  pemview.jsemp  precodear EventsView  React.createBackboneClass mixins [     React.BackboneMixinevents, all ],  getInitialState function      return          hasEvents window.hasEvents      ,  componentDidMount function      var model  this      This waits after component loading to check whether hasEvents is the same     setTimeoutfunction          ifmodel.state.hasEvents  window.hasEvents              model.setState                 hasEvents window.hasEvents                           , 1000 ,  render function      var view     if this.props.events.length gt 0          view   this.props.events.mapfunctionyear                          return ltYearView yearyear gt                           if this.state.hasEvents           view  ltNoEventsView gt          return           other parts of the page were also rendered here         view       codepre  pessentially codecomponentDidMountcode waits for a while after component mounting and then double checks a global variable. Definitely not a great workaround especially since it relies on a 1 second codetheseEventscode population and it only works on the initial component mounting.p

Negative 43464 pI am new to Semantic Mediawiki, which has recently been installed on a wiki I contribute to. I am considering how to represent some of the data, and I thing subobjects might help, but Im not clear on the details.p  pIn particular, there are a few properties, such as Filming Location for a video the wiki is for an internet comedy website, that seem a natural fit for the Page datatype, as most of the common locations have a related page, but some oneoff locations dont seem worth having a page each. Can you create subobjects of a page that lists all such locations instead, and use those as property values, and if so, how Also, if so, what does the link point to when you add the value Using the [[LocationValue]] notation, and what is the text of the link Are there any downsides to this approach, assuming it works.p  pTo be clear, I would like to miss Locations with pages, and Location that are just subobjects, with Location having the datatype Page.   p  pEDIT To clarify further, I still want a page for these locations, to provide a brief description, but on a page called [[Minor Locations]], say, which would include a sentence for each of the minor locations similar to how Wikipedia treats minor characters. My idea is to create the location as a subobject of that page, and the episodes would include the location as a property value, as though they were a page. That way, two episodes could share a minor location, but it wouldnt need a whole article to itself.p

Negative 43464 pIve been researching this issue for quite a while now without making any progress.p  pI was trying to create a wifi configuration profile, using the Apple configurator tool, to enable iOS devices to autojoin or remember my custom adhoc network.p  pI quickly realised that there isnt an option on the configurator to create a profile that refers to an adhoc network. Currently my network appears on the iPhone in the wifi tab under the Devices header and not under the Choose a network header.p  pIf I select to join my adhoc network, it connects without problems and it receives an IP address, I can interact with the network and all is working according to plan.p  pWhen I enable the wifi and the iPhone traces potential wifi networks around me, it pops up the dialog to choose one which doesnt include the Devices network list of choices.p  pThe configurator tool has only options that correspond to access points or hotspots. It doesnt mention anything for Devices networks.p  pIt is imperative for my commercial application that I create a configuration profile to enable iPhones that have my app installed to autojoin this adhoc network.p  pI realise that the delivery of the profile to the device is a whole other issue but there are several methods to do it after the installation process.p  pAny help on this issue will be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pJohn R.p

Negative 43464 pIve read the wiki and the other suggested material, but I cant get my head around creating this Regex. p  pTo detail it, it is required as I need to split a sentence into words, and only the wordvalues so I can compare each word to others in other sentences. This means cases where its  is important to keep the dollar sign, as ten dollars is different to just 10, same for percentages and Toms with apostrophes. With amp only remove when not followed by a space as amp can be used in company names such as BampQ, and money, the currency sign on its own is irrelevant to my needs. p  pSo it would be Remove all punctuation except amp unless followed by a space, and remove  if a space precedes it. p  pThen Ill split by spaces into an array, its just this damn Regex. p  pI have a regex whitelistp  precodeRegex.Replacestring, [09azAZs],  codepre  pI just cant figure out how to specify a characterspace or spacecharacter such as to removes   but leave  when its 10 I know s is for which space but how to I attach to the regex I dont know.p
Negative 43464 pwe have an issue with later and latest Tomcat versions, that prevent us from upgrading to a version later than something like 7.0.22.p  pWe use FormBasedAuthentication with a custom realm. p  pThis is tested with Tomcat 7.0.57 and JDK 7u76 on Windows.p  pMy setup has a login form calling the jsecurity servlet.

I tried downloading a tif file and in order to convert this to a .ssf file and then to a .gsf file I need to first make this into a shape file use shpssf in gempak to make the ssf file and then use gsfssf to make the gsf file that I can use to display my map in gempak with under MAPFIL.  Does anyone know how to convert the .tif or geotiff file into a shape file or where I can get shape files of global mapsp

Negative 43464 pI am working on an Android application in which the user can choose from various video processing modes that work with a camera preview surface.  I am currently attempting to do this with a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingimplementingnavigationlateral.html relnofollowswipe views with tabs per the android docsa.   However, my use case is a bit different in thatp  ul lipTwo of the tabs contain fragments that show a camera video preview on a surface view, but each one has different settings for the camera, so I need to release the camera from one fragment and let the other fragment reconfigure the camera and begin its own preview. pli lipEach of the above two tabs fragments do a bit of processing to the preview images, so I have to pausestop the processing when the tabpage is not being shown.pli ul  pFrom what a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10024739howtodeterminewhenfragmentbecomesvisibleinviewpagercomment1294667410024739I have read around SOa, the swipe views with tabs approach is designed to have all tabs running even while they are not shown, so that the UX is good when swiping between tabs. But because I need to partially stop invisible tabs, I have to do a bit of hacking to determine when this happens.  I am able to do so most of the time with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma11075663868173this hooka, but that does not handle the case of when the tabs are loaded, as the codesetUserVisibleHintcode is called before the underlying fragments surface is created, so I cannot start the camera at that time.  The surface and other elements within the fragment all think they are visible even when the tab is not selected, so it doesnt seem trivial to make this work when the surface is created.p  pI thought perhaps there would be a less fancy tabbed view paradigm without swiping ability, but Im not having much luck finding one.p  pThe options Im seeing arep  ul liContinue to try and leverage codesetUserVisibleHintcode with the standard codeViewPagercode to try and communicate to the camera fragments when they should start the camera preview and subsequent processing.li liWrite my own view pager which does not try to cachepreload all tabs, so that the lifecycles of the underlying views act more like normal views in activities.li liFind another paradigm to use instead of tabbed views.li ul  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 43464 pSorry the really newbie question but I want to get a simple answer.p  pWe have our data come in to us and it gets stored as raw data. Currently we have an ICT team who have produced an ETL process that does a lot of work turning it into something usable for analysis but this takes a lot of time. The issue is that the time taken means that the data quality report that needs to go back is often late and prevents issues from being resolved. As DQ needs to be done on raw data and not cleaned, can I run build a second ETL process to create the DQ tables. p  pBy this I mean can they both be run simultaneously as the main ETL will be an Oracle process using the raw data as a data source and the one I want to build will also use raw data in Oracle as a data source using SSIS.p  pI know its probably a simple question, but as its not something I do on a day to day basis so I dont know if it can be done this way or if one will have to wait until the other has finished.p  pWe are storing the data in Oracle 11g and doing the major process there.

Negative 43464 pI am extracting image features for texture identification. I want to extract image features from a code2D imagecode. These features should capture the codemicrocode as well as codemacro geometrycode of the image. I have tried to find out some algorithm which can give me the above result. I tried codeSIFTcode but it only captures the details of macro geometry, shape and edge details. On the other hand i have tried various versions of LBP like CSLBP, LNBP etc but they can only capture the pixel differences and not the overall scheme of things. Another technique that i tried was using GLCM with different distance and orientation values . But still there is a problem that the resulting histogram is too large and the time taken for comparison is too large. Additionally, the results are not very good also. The classification rate with SVM was only 48.  Can anyone guide me in finding a generic algorithm which can capture the pixel level differences as well as the overall texture pattern.p

I would need to connect to the server As a TcpClient and get the stream Like above. And then wait for messages and do something with it. The reason I cannot just have the client receive a message back from the server immediately after sending one is because the client will send a message to the server, and then that message will be broadcast to all the clients that are connected. So each client needs to be listening for messages from the server.p

Negative 43464 pI have an outbound channel adapter in this case is SFTP but it would be the same for a JMS or WS at the end of a Spring Integration flow. By using direct channels every time there is a messaging flowing, it will be sent out synchronously. Now, I need to process messages all the way until they reach the outbound adapter, but wait for a predetermined interval before sending them out. In other words batching the send operation.

Negative 43464 pI am trying to figure out the individual App process elapsed time that is running in an Android device by core.

Im not sure if the problem is the DISTINCT keyword, or the function, or the use of FOR XML PATH, or all of it.  I am optimizing a view that takes 15 mins to run, and the execution plan says 90 of the work is in the DISTINCT sort.  So I am looking for a way to get rid of it.p  pThe actual view query is really big, but an example of this section isp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT p.PersonName, dbo.fnSizesp.PersonId as Size FROM dbo.Person p JOIN dbo.Size s ON p.PersonId  s.PersonId codepre  pThe DISTINCT is in there to get rid of the extra Bob rows, because Bob has many sizes.  I need to keep the multiple sizes on Bobs row, but I dont want multiple rows of Bob.  Is there a more efficient way to do that other than using DISTINCTp  pSecond, word on the street is that functions are best avoided if you are going for speed.  I dont see a way to use FOR XML PATH outside the function, because I cant get it to work on just one column.  So I am looking for a way to produce the multiple values on one row.p

Negative 43464 pIm generating PDFs using iText and it works fine. But I need a way to import html styled informations from an existing PDF at some point. I know i could just use the XMLWorker class to generate the text directly from html in my own document. But cause Im not sure whether it actually supports all html features Im looking to work around this. Therefore a PDF is generated from html using XSLT. The content of this PDF then should be copied to my document. There are two ways discribed in the book iText in Action. One that parses the PDF and gets you the text or other informations from the document using PdfReaderContentParser and TextExtractionStrategy. It looks like thisp  precodePdfReader reader  new PdfReaderpdf PdfReaderContentParser parser  new PdfReaderContentParserreader TextExtractionStrategy strategy forint i1iltreader.getNumberOfPagesi strategy  parser.processContenti, new LocationTextExtractionStrategy document.addnew Chunkstrategy.getResultantText  codepre  pBut this only prints plain text to the document. Obviously there are more ExtractionStrategys and maybe one of them does exactly what i want but i couldnt find it yet.p  pThe second way is to copy an itextpdf.text.Image of each side of the PDF to your document. This is obviously not a good idea, cause it will add the entire page to your document even if there is only one line of text in the existing PDF. Its done like thisp  precodePdfWriter writer  PdfWriter.getInstancedocument, new FileOutputStreamRESULT PdfReader reader  new PdfReaderpdf PdfImportedPage page forint i1iltreader.getNumberOfPagesi page  writer.getImportedPagereader,i document.addImage.getInstancepage  codepre  pLike I said this copys all the empty lines at the end of the PDF aswell, but i need to continue my text immediatly after the last line of text. If I could convert this itext.text.Image into a java.awt.BufferedImage I could use getSubImage and informations i can extract from the PDF to cut away all the empty lines. But i wasnt able to find a way to to this.p  pThis are the two ways i found. But cause none of them is suitable for my purpose as they are my question is Is there a way to import everything except the empty lines at the end, but including textstyle informations, tables and everything else from a PDF to my document using iTextp
