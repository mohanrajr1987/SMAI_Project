Positive 57799 pSome days ago i assisted to a project meeting as part of my career and they were discussing about this new product a fiscalization software, in theory a  huge system and had to be a web solution. Somebody asked why not using Symfony2 and the guy i think was the architect toll him that, because the dimensions of the sw and the amount of data maybe a Spring framework was a better approach... and the war began. p  pSo, my question is, in which context is better using one or another framework I dnt think that the language benefits is so important given that php has evolved very much after the 5.4 version, so that of i do this in java but you dont in php is not longer applied. Besides, these both frameworks are great, so where should be or not applied one or anotherp
Positive 57799 pI have a few entities that have a few associations. They are loading up fine now. So I basically have a customer entity, that relates to an address entity. I also have a receipt transaction that relates to a customer. p  pWhen I retrieve a small set of customers I want to retrieve their related receipts but that set is huge. I want just the receipts from the last 2 weeks. p  pI thought that I could use a custom repository then use a function like customergetRecentReceipts but that doesnt work since the customer entity doesnt know about the repository. And from reading on this forum, people seem to say not to use the repository this way. How should I structure things to limit the loading of my receipt entities. Im trying to avoid loading all then sorting them with a php routine. p

I also found a hrefhttpwww.zeitoun.netarticlescometandphpstartthis examplea, but it doesnt seem to work in webkit even after a fair bit of tinkering I got it to work everywhere else. a hrefhttpsimonwillison.net2007Nov16This announcement from the safari bloga seems to suggest that its possible with xhr, but I couldnt find any code or documentation, nor I could get it to work.p  pDoes anyone know of a technique, script, library or demo that accomplishes HTTP streaming comet in Webkit browsers Safari and Chrome p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter a bit more tinkering, I found that there are two things that need to be done in order to get http streaming working in Safari via XHRp  ul liThe response needs to have a ContentType multipartxmixedreplaceli liThe response needs to send a few noise characters before the browser begins to display updates consistently. Im assuming this has something to do with filling some internal buffer.li ul  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pI finally got it to work in all browsers using an iframe technique. The caveat to the solution is that only WebKitbased browsers should receive the multipartxmixedreplace header.p
Negative 57799 pIm mostly familiar with Java, C and C in which there are ways to control that only one thread is accessing a resource at any given time. Now Im in search for something similar but in PHP 5.x.p  pTo formulate my problem with one examplep  pI have an ASCIIfile which only stores a number, the value of a page load counter. At application deployment the file will simply hold a 0. For each access the value will be incremented by one. The goal is to keep track of page loads.p  pThe problem comes when many users are concurrently accessing the page containing the counter. When thread A has read the current value, lets say it is 11, another thread which we call B reads the value, still 11. Then the first thread A increments the read value and writes 12 in the file and closes it. Then the second thread B, increments the read value, which was 11, gets 12 and writes that into the file. The value 12 is stored in the file, when it really should have been 13.p  pIn another programming language I would have solved this using a mutex. I understand there are mutexes, shared memory and other funcionality as part of modules. But I would like a solution which works on most servers out there. Platform independent. Installed on most cheap web hosts. Is there a good solution to this problem And if there isnt, which way would you take if using a strongdatabase is not an optionstrongp
Negative 57799 pI have written a program in C to parse large XML files and then create files with insert statements.  Some other process would ingest the files into a MySQL database.  This data will serve as a indexing service so that users can find documents easily.p  pI have chosen InnoDB for the ability of rowlevel locking.  The C program will be generating any where from 500 to 5 million insert statements on a given invocation.p  pWhat is the best way to get all this data into the database as quickly as possible  The other thing to note is that the DB is on a separate server.  Is it worth moving the files over to that server to speed up insertsp  pEDIT  This table wont really be updated, but rows will be deleted.    p

Negative 57799 pas I learned the hard way, Flash streams your .swf, that is, it can start playing back the file even if only the first couple of frames are loaded.p  pNormally, when loading an external .swf you would just register a handler to the COMPLETE event of the Loader or URLLoader class and that would be it. Example exception handling, etc. omittedp  precodevar loaderURLLoader  new URLLoader loader.addEventListenerEvent.COMPLETE, completeHandler loader.loadrequest   function completeHandlereventEventvoid      trigger starting playback here  codepre  pHowever, if the .swf file is the main swf, that is, the one referenced from the html, I can only access the root.loaderInfo property, that is, this p  precoderoot.loaderInfo.loader.addEventListenerEvent.COMPLETE, completeHandler codepre  pgives me the error iThe loading object is not sufficiently loaded to provide this information.ip  pThe workaround that does the job but makes me cringe is having a timer and polling the bytesLoaded property like thisp  precodevar PollerTimer  new Timer500, 0 Poller.addEventListenerTimerEvent.TIMER, waitForLoad var eEvent waitForLoade   function waitForLoadeventEventvoid   if root.loaderInfo.bytesLoaded lt root.loaderInfo.bytesTotal       if Poller.running Poller.start      return     else       Poller.stop        completeHandlerevent    codepre  pThere has to be a better solution than this.

Negative 57799 p2D spatial indexing questionp  pWhat do you call a data structure that is essentially an infinite quadtree whose nodes contain neither absolute coordinates nor absolute scales  in which the coordinate system of each node has been normalized to the unit square 0,01,1, and in which the toplevel node is not fixed absolutelyp  pIts a quadtree, of course  but what emtypeem of quadtree is it  Is there a common name  Ive seen dozens of types of quadtrees named and defined in the literature, but not this particular one.p  pTo render a scene, you are given some starting node not necessarily the root, its size in pixels, and its location on the screen.  You then draw all objects within the node by scaling their coordinates using a current transformation matrix, which you push on the stack and halve as you go down the tree.  The absolute coordinates of the nodes are thus available only though temporary work variables during rendering, and are not contained within the data structure itself.p  pIf an object within a node moves outside of the node e.g., outside the unit square, you pass it to the parent for reassignment to another node.  If an object becomes fragmented for example, an asteroid hit by a bullet, the smaller portions are passed down to children nodes, who must scale the coordinates appropriately to maintain the unitsquare normalization within each node.p  pThe key difference here from traditional quadtree implementations used in spatial indexing is that the coordinates of objects are always relative to the coordinate system of the node within which they are contained. This relativism applies not only to position but also to scale.p  p Infinite for the lack of absolute coordinates even doubleprecision floatingpoint coordinates impart limits on position and size when used for absolute positioning.p

We are using server and and client side validation on the MVC website as well as in the SOAP API Layer.p  pTo avoid having to manually write client side validation we are implementing strongly typed views in conjunction with the Html.TextBoxFor and Html.ValidationMessageFor HTML helpers, as shown in Step 3 a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20100115aspnetmvc2modelvalidation.aspx relnofollowherea.  We also create custom models for each form where one form takes input for multiple domain objects.p  pThis is where the problem begins, the HTML helpers read from the model for the data annotation validation attributes.  In most cases our forms deal with multiple domain objects and you cant specify more than one type in the ltPage ... InheritsSystem.Web.Mvc.ViewPageltMvcApplication.Models.SomeModelgt  page directive.  So we are forced to create a custom model class, which would mean duplicating validation attributes from the domain objects on to the model class.p  pIve spent quite some time looking for workarounds to this, such has referencing the same MetadataType from both the domain class and the custom MVC models, but that wont work for several reasonsp  ol lipYou can only specify one MetadataType attribute per class, so its a problem if a model references multiple domain objects, each with their own metadata type.pli lipThe data annotation validation code throws an exception if the model class doesnt contain a property that is specified in the referenced MetadataType which is a problem with the model only deals with a subset of the properties for a given domain object.pli ol  pIve looked at other solutions as well but to no avail.  If anyone has any ideas on how to achieve a single source for validation logic that would work across MVC client and server side validation functionality and other locations such as my SOAP API I would love to hear itp  pThanks in advance,p  pMatthewp

Negative 57799 pIve an app which uses the MPAudioPlayerController to access the iPod music library, and an AVAudioPlayer to overlay audio on top of the music.  Ive used a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibraryDOCUMENTATIONAudioConceptualAudioSessionProgrammingGuideConfigurationConfiguration.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40007875CH3SW2this documentationa as a guide. Specificallyp  blockquote   pFinally, you can enhance a category to automatically lower the volume of other audio when your audio is playing. This could be used, for example, in an exercise application. Say the user is exercising along to their iPod when your application wants to overlay a verbal messagefor instance, Youve been rowing for 10 minutes. To ensure that the message from your application is intelligible, apply the kAudioSessionPropertyOtherMixableAudioShouldDuck property to the audio session. When ducking takes place, all other audio on the deviceapart from phone audiolowers in volume.p blockquote  pBut Im not seeing this behavior.  In fact, what I see or hear, rather is that if I setup the AudioSession with kAudioSessionPropertyOtherMixableAudioShouldDuck set to true, the MPAudioPlayerController initial volume gets reduced, and if I then call pause and then play again on the MPAudioPlayerController the volume level gets increased to normal levels.  Playing the AVAudioPlayer does not have any affect on the audio level...p  pSo Ive set up a simple test case to reproduce this.p  pIn a ViewController headerp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import ltMediaPlayerMediaPlayer.hgt import ltAudioToolboxAudioToolbox.hgt import ltAVFoundationAVFoundation.hgt  interface MusicPlayerVolumeTestViewController  UIViewController ltAVAudioPlayerDelegategt      UIButton musicButton     UIButton soundButton     AVAudioPlayer audioPlayer     MPMusicPlayerController musicPlayerController  property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UIButton musicButton property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UIButton soundButton property nonatomic, retain MPMusicPlayerController musicPlayerController   IBActionmusicAction  IBActionsoundAction  end codepre  pand in the implementationp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Setup our Audio Session     OSStatus status  AudioSessionInitializeNULL, NULL, NULL, NULL         We want our audio to play if the screen is locked or the mute switch is on     UInt32 sessionCategory  kAudioSessionCategoryMediaPlayback     status  AudioSessionSetProperty kAudioSessionPropertyAudioCategory, sizeof sessionCategory, ampsessionCategory     We want our audio to mix with other apps audio     UInt32 shouldMix  true     status  AudioSessionSetProperty kAudioSessionPropertyOverrideCategoryMixWithOthers, sizeof shouldMix, ampshouldMix     Enable ducking of the iPod volume level while our sounds are playing     UInt32 shouldDuck  true     AudioSessionSetPropertykAudioSessionPropertyOtherMixableAudioShouldDuck, sizeofshouldDuck, ampshouldDuck     Activate our audio session     AudioSessionSetActiveYES      Setup the Music Player to access the iPod music library     self.musicPlayerController  [MPMusicPlayerController applicationMusicPlayer]     [self.musicPlayerController setShuffleMode MPMusicShuffleModeSongs]     [self.musicPlayerController setRepeatMode MPMusicRepeatModeNone]     [self.musicPlayerController setQueueWithQuery[MPMediaQuery songsQuery]]      Setup a AVAudioPlayer sound to overlay against the Music Player audio     NSURL soundURL  [NSURL URLWithString[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourceoverlay ofTypemp3]]     NSError error  nil     audioPlayer  [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURLsoundURL error amperror]     if audioPlayer              NSLogCould not create audio effect player , [error localizedDescription]          [audioPlayer prepareToPlay]    IBActionmusicAction      if self.musicPlayerController.playbackState  MPMusicPlaybackStatePlaying              [self.musicPlayerController pause]          else if self.musicPlayerController.playbackState  MPMusicPlaybackStateStopped            self.musicPlayerController.playbackState  MPMusicPlaybackStatePaused              [self.musicPlayerController play]         IBActionsoundAction      if audioPlayer.playing              [audioPlayer pause]          else              [audioPlayer play]       codepre  pIve wired up a couple UIButtons.

And, more buglike, is that when I pause and then play the MPMusicPlayerController the volume of the music increases to the level it would have been if I did not setup the AudioSession.p  pIm interested to know if anyone else has had this experience, and if so if youve found a work around or can tell me that Im doing something wrong.

Negative 57799 pSo, I am a fairly new programmer working towards an undergraduate Comp Sci degree with a very small amount of work experience. In looking for internshiptype jobs for my program, I have noticed that what Ive heard from several profs  working with databases makes up 90 of all modern computer science jobs  looks like it is actually true. However, my program doesnt really have any courses with databases until 3rd year, so Im trying to at least learn some things myself in the mean time.p  pIve seen very little on SO and the internet in general for somebody like myself. There seem to be tons of tutorials on the mechanics of how to read and write data in a database, but little on the associated best practices. To demonstrate what I am talking about, and to help get across my actual question, here is what can a hrefhttpwww.csharpstation.comTutorialsAdoDotNetLesson01.aspxeasily be found on the internetap  precodepublic static void Main       using var conn  new OdbcConnection              var command  new OdbcCommand         command.Connection  conn         command.CommandText  SELECT  FROM Customer WHERE id  1         var dbAdapter  new OdbcDataAdapter         dbAdapter.SelectCommand  command         var results  new DataTable         dbAdapter.Fillresults            then you would do something like     string customerName  string results.Rows[0][name]   codepre  pAnd so forth. This is pretty simple to understand but obviously full of problems. I started out with code like this and quickly started saying things like well it seems dumb to just have SQL all over the place, I should put all that in a constants file. And then I realized that it was silly to have those same lines of code all over the place and just put all that stuff with connection objects etc inside a methodp  precodepublic DataTable GetTableFromDB string sql       code similar to first sample       string getCustomerSql  String.FormatConstants.SelectAllFromCustomer, customerId DataTable customer  GetTableFromDBgetCustomerSql string customerName  string customer.Rows[0][name] codepre  pThis seemed to be a big improvement. Now its supereasy to, say, change from an OdbcConnection to an SQLiteConnection. But that last line, accessing the data, still seemed awkward and it is still a pain to change a field name like going from name to CustName or something. I started reading about a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa581776.aspxusing typed Data sets or custom business objectsa. Im still kind of confused by all the terminology, but decided a hrefhttpwww.informit.comarticlesarticle.aspxp1273361to look into it anyway.a I figure that it is stupid to rely on a shiny Database Wizard to do all this stuff for me like in the linked articles before I actually learn what is going on, and why. So I took a stab at it myself and started getting things likep  precodepublic class Customer      public string Name get set     public int Id get set      public void Populate               string getCustomerSql  String.FormatConstants.SelectAllFromCustomer, this.Id         DataTable customer  GetTableFromDBgetCustomerSql         this.Name  string customer.Rows[0][name]            public static IEnumerableltCustomergt GetAll              foreach  ...                 blah blah             yield return customer                codepre  pto hide the ugly table stuff and provide some strong typing, allowing outside code to just do things likep  precodevar customer  new CustomercustId customer.Populate string customerName  customer.Name codepre  pwhich is really nice. And if the Customer table changes, changes in the code only need to happen in one place inside the codeCustomercode class.p  pSo, at the end of all this rambling, my question is this. Has my slow evolution of database code been going in the right direction And where do I go next This style is all well and good for smallish databases, but when there are tons of different tables, writing out all those classes for each one would be a pain. I have heard about software that can generate that type of code for you, but am kind of still confused by the DALORMLINQ2SQLetc jargon and those huge pieces of software are kind of overwhelming. Im looking for some good notoverwhelminglycomplex resources that can point me in the right direction. All I can find on this topic are complex articles that go way over my head, or articles that just show you how to use the pointandclick wizards in Visual Studio and such. Also note that Im looking for information on working with Databases in code, not information on Database designnormalization...theres lots of good material on that out there.p  pThanks for reading this giant wall of text.p

Negative 57799 pI have a webapp written in PHP using a MySQL database backend. This question could just as easily apply to any language and application trying to use an SQL database and MVC OOP design.p  pstrongHow do you keep your SQL code restricted to the Modelstrongp  pTheres a rather longer story specific to my case behind the question.  As previously mentioned Im working on a PHPMySQLAJAX website.  I designed it using OOP and MVC design principles  with a Model, View and Controller.  I managed to keep the view elements  such as markup and styling  restricted completely to the View and to make them reusable fairly easily.  I thought I had done the same with SQL code.  But as work has progressed, its become pretty clear that the Model needs some serious refactoring.p  pThe way Id found to keep the SQL in the Model was to encapsulate every single SQL query in its own Query object.  And then when I needed to call some SQL in the View or Controller I would access the query through a factory.  No SQL code exists in the Controller or the View.p  pBut this has become extraordinarily tedious.  I dont think Im actually gaining anything by doing this and am spending far too much time creating queries with names like SelectIdsFromTableWhereUser.  The factory for the queries is approaching thousands of lines.  A bit of searching in Eclipse has revealed that the vast majority of these queries are used in one or two places and never again.  Not good.p  pI know that in good MVC you want to keep the SQL completely separate from the Controller or the View.  But at this point, it seems to me like it would have been better to just place the SQL where it was needed in the code and not bother trying to bury it and database code deep in the Model.  These queries are only being used once, why bother encapsulating them  p  pIs it that important to keep the SQL separate from Controller or the View  What is gained by doing this  What is lost by allowing it to spread  How do you solve this problemp  pstrongEditstrong Per request, heres a little more detail on my model.p  pThere are two portions to it.  The Tables portion and the Queries portion.  The Tables portion holds the domain objects  mostly designed as wrappers around class objects that are exact analogues of the tables in the database.  For example, there might be a database table codeFoocode that has fields codeidcode, codenamecode, and codetypecode.  There will be a Table object codeclass FooTablecode that has an array with fields id, name and type.  It would look like thisp  precodeclass FooTable extends MySQLTable      private id     private data     private statements      public function constructid, dataNULL, populatefalse            Initialize the table with prepared statements to populate, update and insert.  Also,           initialize it with any data passed in from the data object.           public function getfield      public function setfield, value      public function populate      public function update      public function insert   codepre  pIf theres a codefooBarcode database table that has a one to many relation one codeFoocode many codeBarscode with fields codeidcode, codefooIDcode, and codebarcode then there will be a codeFooBarcode Table object codeclass FooBarTablecode which will look pretty much exactly the same as the above codeFooTablecode.p  pThe codeFooTablecode and many codeFooBarTablecode objects will both be contained in the codeFoocode object.  Give the codeFoocode object factory an id to a codeFoocode table and it populates itself with codeFoocodes data and all of its codeBarcodes and their data.     p  pThe Query objects are used for pulling out those codeFoocode ids in the order they are needed.  So, if I want the codeFoocode objects ordered by date, vote or name, I need a different query object to do it.  Or if I want to select all codeFoocode objects that have a codeBarcode in a certain range.  I need a query object.p  pMost of the time I use the Table objects the wrappers, not the base tables to interact with the database.  But when it comes to selecting which table objects, thats where the queries come in.p  pDuring original design I didnt think there would be too many queries and I thought they were going to be things that would see reuse.  Since there might be several places where Id want the codeFoocodes in date order.  But it hasnt worked out that way.  There are way more of them than anticipated and most of them are one offs, used once in some View or Command and then never again.  I also thought the queries might encapsulate fairly complex SQL and it would be good to have them as objects so that I would always be sure to give them the data they needed and it would be a relatively sanitized environment in which to test the SQL query itself.  But again, it didnt work out that way.  Most of them contain pretty simple SQL.p

Surprised at such a simple solution thanks I tried it but unfortunately, only the first line showed up in zenity and nothing else.p  pstrongFix attempt 3strongp  pAfter doing some straceing and inspecting gits source code, I realise that git outputs all its progress information anything past the Initialized message on stderr, and the fact that this is the first line and my assumption that its because of cat quitting early on EOF was a coincidencemisguided assumption git doesnt EOF until the program ends.p  pThe situation seemed to become a lot simpler, as I shouldnt have to change anything from the original code at the start of the question and it should work.

Negative 57799 pI have an iPad App which shows a whole load of information and related images. For instance I can access to the section Events, from which I can choose one. Every single one has different dates or side events. Once I choose the side event, I charge some small views, which contain the title of the news a small image as a preview and a short text in a ViewController which has a ScrollView. This previews can be a lot. There are no leaks due to my code I analized with Instruments and the only ones I can find are due to NSXMLParser bug, but I have noticed that the live bytes dont slow down, ever, they only grow. Every time I have to update the content of the ScrollView I take care of inserting the following codep  precodeif  bannerVideo      [banner release]    banner  nil   codepre  pDo you by any chance know what could be the reason for such a constant growthp

This is cluttering the code and other coders are constantly messing it up with their own interpretations which dont use the specific codeCompanyMessagescodeclass which is needed to format the messages to be read by the monitoring tools. So I am looking for a way to get rid of emallem code above and just provide all methods which need tracelogging with annotations like codeLogBeforelogLevelcode amp codeLogAfterlogLevelcode. p  pThe reason I choose this solution is to make it so other developers dont have to learn anything new but to use annotations instead of code. Im working in a server environment in which we deploy hundreds of web applications and dozens of developers. So I have been looking for a way to implement this in a web application without a lot of extra coding or additional large libraries. This means Im looking for a small, stable AOP implementation using annotations similar to those I proposed, easy to configure in each web application. Performance is also important. What is the simplest example to implement this with AOP p  pEdit I did find a hrefhttpwww.javacodegeeks.com201101aspectorientedprogrammingspringaop.html relnofollowsomething very similara to what Im looking for, but this has a couple of problems. All classes that need logging must be configured, which would be more resource intensive than just using annotations. Would the spring configuration codeltaopaspectjautoproxygtcode fix thatp

Negative 57799 pI may be overthinking this, but I see all sorts of potential problems....p  pI have a table that Ill call Master. Among other items, it contains a field called Serial. I emthoughtem this would be a static itemi.e., that it would never change once initially assigned, for any given row in Master. I now find out that it emcanem change, and not only that, I need to store history of those changes.p  pI can break Serial out into a separate table, where each row will have a MasterId, EffectiveDate and Termination Date the current Serial for a Master row would be the one and only onecodeenforced row with a Null TerminationDate. So far, so good....p  pNow the problem that Im asking about I have a bound form built on a Select from Master that includes Serial. p  pWhat I emthinkem I want to do, to make this changeability transparent to the user, is to shortcircuit any changes that are made to the Serial text box, probably in the text box BeforeUpdate event. Id then use code to Terminate the current row in the Serial table amp insert a new row, which becomes current and is displayed in the text box. I would I think need to cancel the update in the forms recordset, emwithoutem losing any changes the user has made to other fields....p  pIts at this point that my brain goes out to lunch, since Im still much more comfortable with unbound forms amp Save buttons. Can I do this, as proposed What tricks amp traps do I need to know about If need be, I can make the Serial field on the form readonly, and require a popup to edit it, but Id rather avoid that if I can.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHope this helpsp  pstrongBeforestrongp  precodetable Master   Id             AutoNumber  PK   Serial         Text20   other fields codepre  pCurrent frmMaster RecordSource p  precodeSELECT Id, Serial, yada, yada FROM Master WHERE blahBlah codepre  pstrongAfterstrongp  precodetable Master   Id             AutoNumber  PK   other fields  table Serial   Id             AutoNumber  PK   MasterId       Long   Serial         Text20   EffDt          DateTime   TermDt         DateTime codepre  pNew frmMaster RecordSource p  precodeSELECT Master.Id, Serial.Serial, yada, yada  FROM Master LEFT JOIN Serial ON Master.Id  Serial.MasterId  WHERE Serial.TermDt is Null AND blahBlah codepre  pAn edit on the form should result in  p  ol liSelected row in Serial gets TermDt filled Now.

My remaining stumbling block may not even be an issue though if thats the case, can someone explain why.p  pThe use case of adding a Master is pretty straightforward, but in the use case of an update that changes the Serial Im still confused if codetxtSerialcode is bound to codeSerial.Serialcode, and the user changes the contents of codetxtSerialcode, wont Access attempt to Update the contents of codeSerial.Serialcode to match How does Adding a Serial row on change which looks like it should work a treat, prevent the Update of the existing Serial rowp

When I checked the localStorage file size in Chromes cache folder it is 2MB. Its an sqlite db. It looks like the browser is using the actual localStorage database size, not the size of the data stored inside it. Which of course sucks, but is probably standard behavior. I guess the longest string you can store in localStorage is somewhere around 2,500,000 charactersp

Negative 57799 pI need to do SELECT query from java code on table that contains 1kkk rows , so the result set will be near 1kk rows. thats why I need to limit it, and run select query many times and each time to retrieve 10k rows only. After I get 10k rows I update it so in the next SELECT they wont be retrieved.   The problem is  in each select oracle looking from first row in the table so it reduces the performance.     How can I use OFFSET for avoiding oracle looking from first row and pass over already updated rowsp
Negative 57799 pI am using boostsharedptr to organize my pointer data in my game engine.p  pI tried to make a very short example to show my problemp  precodeclass CSceneNode  public     CSceneNodeCScene p  parentp       void foo          parentgtnotifyThatFooWasCalledOnMemysharedptrversionofthis           CScene parent   class CScene  public     void addNode          nodes.pushbackboostsharedptrltCSceneNodegtnew CSceneNodethis           void notifyThatFooWasCalledOnMeboostsharedptrltCSceneNodegt node          foowascalled[node]  true           stdlistltboostsharedptrltCSceneNodegt gt nodes     stdmapltboostsharedptrltCSceneNodegt, boolgt foowascalled  codepre  pThus the problem is CScene creates CSceneNodes and owns these in boostsharedptrs into a list.p  pNow the child needs to notify the parent of a change. This is easy, as I passed the pointer of CScene onto CSceneNode, the node knows its parent. As the node will not live longer than the parent, it is ok to just pass a pointer.p  pBut the parent also needs to know who it is that calls it back, and theres the problem. The parent doesnt know the raw pointers, it only knows shared pointers, so the only way to find out which child is calling is searching over all nodes to find that one with the same raw pointer inside, or create another map mapping from raw pointer to sharedptr. This last one then needs extra maintenance when a node is deleted. I could also pass the sharedptr to the child itself to help it send itself back, but that seems stupid.p  pCan anyone tell me what to do Is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 57799 pIm relatively new to Android, and Im trying to port an app from iOS, which does something slightly unconventional.p  pMy app has an inhouse xml language for representing GUI kind of our own nibxib in iOS or reslayoutwhatever.xml in android, believe me, we had no choice, and an inflation mechanism that inflates this xml and builds a view controller and view instances. p  pAs a result, in iOS, my app had several live UIViewController instances of the same class added and removed from the navigation stack as necessary which were all inflated once from different XMLs and remained alive as long as the app was.p  pNow, Im a bit unsure about the correct way to do this in Android. Ideally, I would like to be able to create instances of an Activity class, each with its views inflated from our xml language, and do the navigation between then. However, to my understanding this is not possible in Android since activities are started by intents, and created by class.p  ol liIs it true that I would not be able to keep activities alive and at the same time  not on stack i.e. back always kills activitiesli liIf so, does this mean I need to inflate the activities and all their views from xml, every time I navigate forward  serious performance issue, or is there an alternativeli liIs it reasonable to at least save the parsed xml structure in an Application subclass, so the inflation will be fasterli liWould it make sense to only send on creation and save for persistency an activity identifier to the new activity instance, and have it go to my Application subclass, and inflate itself  get its state by identifierli ol  pIn general, assuming having the GUI inflated from XML is a must, and I would like to minimize the need to reinflate the GUI, what would you suggest as the cleanest solutionp  pAny other tips will be greatly appreciated Thanksp

Negative 57799 pSo far I have been able to wrap my brain around RoR fairly well. But this certain scenario, which I do plan to make use of quite a bit, has me a little stumped.p  pCurrently in my application I have a view setup named dashboard.html.erb. This view requires a high level of customization by the user, they will need to have the ability to add and remove widgetspartials as they see fit. These partials are not designed to use data from the dashboard controller.p  pMy first question is, what would be the best practice way to get data into these partials My initial thought was to use a ajax get request for each partial that is being displayed, however this seems like unnecessary overhead.p  pMy second question is, when using a controller that does not require a specific view, but instead returns json data, what are the best practices for creating this controller actionp

Negative 57799 pI have a table with 150x150 cells which each have a colored background and a small imagesymbol in them. Additionally each cell can have zero or more of its borders set also. The user can change and add borders and change the cell color and cell. This all works pretty well using jquery and it is just a plain html table.p  pAt the end of the user experience I am making a pdf of this table for them to download. This is a big job and takes a while, which is not my main concern now. jQuery gathers the table data in an array and sends it to php to recreate it as an image using the gd library.p  pSo for each cell I was drawing a rectangle of the correct color on a large image, loading the symbol image and resampling it on to the large image, drawing the borders and imagedestroy the symbol image, it worked but took 1 minute. I changed my strategy to make a small colored rectangke impose the image on it and cache it in an array to be quickly used again.

Ive been unable to call the command line svn update username user password pass because of this. Yet Watin needs to be run in an interactive mode, and the service wont let me . Im able to get it to work if we manually log on to the server and run ccnet as command line.

Negative 57799 pI have recently started reading about dependency injection and it has made me rethink some of my designs.p  pThe problem i have is something like this Lets say i have two classes Car and Passenger For those two classes i have some data mappers to work with the database CarDataMapper and PassengerDataMapperp  pI want to be able to do something like this in codep  precodecar  CarDataMappergtgetCarById23  returns the car object foreachcargtgetPassengers as passenger  returns all passengers of that car     passengergtdoSomething  codepre  pBefore I knew anything about DI, I would build my classes like thisp  precodeclass Car      private id     private passengers  null      public function getPassengers         ifthisgtpassengers  null             passengerDataMapper  new PassengerDataMapper             passengers  passengerDataMappergtgetPassengersByCarIdthisgtgetId             thisgtsetPassengerspassengers                  return thisgtpassengers          codepre  pI would also have similar code in the PassengergetCar method to fetch the car the passenger is in.p  pI now understand that this creates dependencies well, I understood it before too, but I wasnt aware that this is wrong between the Car and the Passenger objects and the data mapper objects.p  pWhile trying to think of the solution for this two options came to mind, but I dont really like any of themp  p1 Doing something like thisp  precodecar  carDataMappergtgetCarById23 passengers  passengerDataMappergtgetPassengersByCarIdcargtgetId cargtsetPassengerspassengers  foreachcargtgetPassengers as passenger     passengergtdoSomething  codepre  pBut what if passengers have objects that they need injected, and what if the nesting goes to ten or twenty levels... I would wind up instantiating nearly every object in the start of my application, which would in turn query the entire database during the process. If i have to send the passenger to another object which has to do something with the objects that the passenger holds, I do not want to immediately instantiate these objects too.p  p2 Injecting the data mappers into the car and passenger objects and having something like thisp  precodeclass Car      private id     private passengers  null     private dataMapper  null      public function constructdataMapper         thisgtsetDataMapperdataMapper           public function getPassengers         ifthisgtpassengers  null ampamp thisgtdataMapper instanceof PassengerDataMapper             passengers  thisgtdataMappergtgetPassengersByCarIdthisgtgetId             thisgtsetPassengerspassengers                  return thisgtpassengers         codepre  pI dont like this any better, because its not like the Car is really unaware of the data mapper, and without the data mapper, the Car could behave unpredictably not returning passengers, when it actually has themp  pSo my first question is  Am I taking a completely wrong approach here, because, the more I look at it, the more it looks like Im building an ORM, instead of a business layerp  pThe second question is  is there a way of actually decoupling the objects and the data mappers in a way that would allow me to use the objects as described in the very first code block p  pThird question Ive seen some answers for other languages some version of C, I think resolving this issue with something like this described here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions130292whatistheproperwaytoinjectadataaccessdependencyforlazyloadingWhat is the proper way to inject a data access dependency for lazy loadinga As I havent had time to play with other languages, this makes no sense to me, so Id be grateful if someone would explain the examples in the link in PHPish.p  pI have also looked at some DI frameworks, and read about DI Containers and Inversion of Control, but from what I understood they are used to define and inject dependencies for non dynamic classes, where for instance, the Car would depend on the Engine, but it would not need the engine to be loaded dynamically from the db, it would simply be instantiated and injected into the Car.p  pSorry for the lengthy post and thanks in advance.p

Negative 57799 pMy explanation below rambles, boiling down, is there a way I can add a Row without firing off an event, such that I can add multiple rows and fire an event to update all of them at once Without having to add code to contain the table data in the custom modelp  pI have a custom TableModel which extends from DefaultTableModel so that I can use DefaultTableModel to keep track of data for me, whilst still having some custom methods of my own.p  pThe issue is, I was thinking it might be faster for me to have an addRowsString[][] val method, when I wish to add multiple rows. I could then fire a single event, probably fireTableDataChanged to update the rows all at once. For example, my current methodp  precodeJTable table1  new JTablenew dgvTableModelnew String[] ltvaluesgt,0, new String[] ltvaluesgt table1.addRownew String[] ltvalues heregt table1.addRownew String[] ltvalues heregt table1.addRownew String[] ltvalues heregt codepre  pI would then repeat the above as many times as necessary. The issue is, each of those will fire off a seperate event. It would be much faster I think, if I could do this using my custom table modelp  precodeJTable table1  new JTablenew dgvTableModelnew String[] ltvaluesgt,0, new String[] ltvaluesgt table1.addRowsnew String[][] ltvalues1 here, values2 here, . . . codepre  pand then in the table modelp  precodepublic void addRowsString[][] values     for String[] vals  values                   super.addRowvals        fireTableDataChanged  codepre  pI can code this in easily. The issue is again, that super.addRowvals line will fire an event each time through.

Adapter focuses on resolving incompatibilities between two existing   interfaces. It doesnt focus on how those interfaces are implemented,   nor does it consider how they might evolve independently. Its a way   of making two independently designed classes work together without   reimplementing one or the other. Bridge, on the other hand, bridges an   abstraction and its potentially numerous implementations. It   provides a stable interface to clients even as it lets you vary the   classes that implement it. It also accommodates new implementations as   the system evolves.p blockquote  pI dont fully understand the above statement, p  ol liDoes it mean that if I vary the adaptee or change the implementation of the original interface at design time then it is strongBridge Patternstrongli liThe differences sounds trivial, Is there any other differences in implementationabstcationli liHow can anyone tell what implementation is used strongafterstrong developmentli liCan anyone give me a good example of bridge pattern and how it can be changed during software lifecycleli ol  pUpdatep  pAgain from GoFp  blockquote   pRemember that an adapter makes two existing interfaces work together   as opposed to defining an entirely new one.p blockquote  pDoes it mean that changing the existing interface so that it can work with another interface is an implementation of strongAdapterstrongp  pUpdate2p  pJust found this incredible article a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles3151IllustratedGOFDesignPatternsinCPartIIStrucIllustrated GOF Design Patterns in Cap  pThis is true Bridge Patter structurep  pI was missing the fact that the Bridge pattern lets you combine the different abstractions and implementations and strongextendstrong them independently img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu3pkn.gif altenter image description herep

Negative 57799 pI am using a hack to make a file upload input display the same across browsers. The trick is to basically set the opacity of the upload input to zero, and position a regular input overtop of it, with custom styling. After the user uploads a file, I am using jquery to grab the value of the filename and to store it in the input that is above it the fake input. p  pMy Jquery isp  precode    var browse  browse      .wpcf7file.onchange, function             fakeUpload.valthis.value.cssbackgroundf1f1f1, textindent72px             browse.cssbackgroundPosition , 5px 60px           input.wpcf7file.hoverfunction         browse.cssbackgroundPosition , 5px 28px     , function         browse.cssbackgroundPosition , 5px 4px      codepre  pAs you can see, there are two things being done here taking a value from the .wpcf7 input and storing it as the value of fakeUpload. The div, browse is more or less a button that indicated the status of the upload. After the user selects the file, the browse button goes to an inactive state.p  pThe problem is after the user goes to this inactive state, the hover effect below it still remains active. After the use uploads the file on change of input I want to disable all hover effects. What is the best way to go about this p  pIf you need to see my htmlcss let me know, but I figured it is pretty straightforward jquery question.p

This is what happens when checkbox music is true so the music is playing, if you then toggle music it works fine. But, if you then want to toggle music back on, it works too, but then the pause doesnt work anymore. In pause I call mPlayer.pause, and that works fine if I havent toggled music on or off. If I have toggled music on or off, pause doesnt work anymore for some reason.p  pThis is pause code p  precodepublic void pauseGame          if mMode  MODEPAUSE              mMode  MODEPAUSE             if mPlayMusic                   return                          if mPlayer  null                   mPlayer.pause                                codepre  pSo thats my problem. The same problem occurs with toggle sound if I toggle sound off, it works and there is no sound anymore sounds like when my fish eats another fish or game over sound, but when I toggle sound on again, it doesnt work no sound is played when it should be played.p  pMy guess is that it has something to do with the booleans. I dont know whats wrong with my code though, what am I doing wrongp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 57799 pSituation I am developing a device application that runs from a single page load and a main module. The application communicates through two API calls. The application requires a current authentication state acquired from an API call to apilogin sent via POST. The API call used to save and populate the data of the view renderings is communicated by an API call sent to api via POST. Both calls are made to the same protocoldomainport.p  pProblem In IE9 only, Chrome and FF work as expected, the data returned is not valid for the second API call to api. In IE9, the developer tool network panel shows that the call is being made to api with all of the parameters that are suppose to be made. However the response shows a failure response as if I was still making a call to the login api with invalid parameters.p  pHow is this possible even though I am configuring the http.post to expire immediately on both calls and cache is set to false on both calls How can I fix it or work around it Below is the code that I am using.p  pEDIT Forgot to mention that I am viewing this from on a

Negative 57799 pI have a really hard time searching for this, because I have no idea how to call it.p  pIll try to describe the process I want, and see if any of you know such an editor. I have a website that has the same html component repeated in them, for example, a menu. I can define how the menu looks with css, but I cant as far as I know add the same piece of html to every html page with a simple line. What I do, is copy the menu over to every place. If I change the menu, I need to do it all again. I know this can be achieved by using a dynamic server, with something like php or jsp, but I dont need it to be dynamic.p  pI was wondering if there was a way to do this. I thought possibly there was an editor, where I can edit html using includes, and then compile the htmls after modification to produce the htmls I will replace on my server.p  pThanksp

Negative 57799 pI have a program that runs a least squares fit to some data. This procedure is run in a separate thread and controlled from a dialog box. This dialog box has a QPlainTextEdit that shows fitting updates and a final report. p  pThe dialog was created in Qt Designer, the code is run into QtCreator and my Qt version is 4.8.1.p  pThe problem I am running into is somewhat erratic. When I run the procedure a first time, everything is fine. Then if I run it again, sometimes the program crashes with the messagep  pterminate called after throwing an instance of stdbadalloc   what  stdbadalloc The program has unexpectedly finished.p  pI tracked the problem to a call to the clear method of a QPlainTextEdit. Here is some code.p  precode Snippets of the class definition class QLSQDialog  public QDialog, public UiQLSQDialog    QOBJECT public   QLSQDialogQWidget parent  0   ...   void UpdateDisplayconst QString ampmsg, int iter, double norm   Update values of chi, etc on displays signals   void Run            Signal to run a LSQ procedure   ... private slots   void onbtnRunclicked   ... private   void Enablesbool running    Enable and disable features depending on running state of LSQ fit   ...

I call a codetxtInfogtclearcode when the object is  created to show an empty text edit. When I click on a Run tool button its default slot emits a Run signal that will start the new thread. The codetxtInfocode QPlainTextEdit is updated in this thread until it finishes in fact the thread emits a signal that is caught in the main application that in turn calls the codeUpdateDisplaycode.p  pIf I click on the run button a second time, then I get the crash and the error. If I replace codetxtInfogtclearcode, codetxtInfogtdocumentgtclearcode, by codetxtInfogtsetPlainTextcode or by codetxtInfogtdocumentgtsetPlainTextcode the problem is the same crash at second execution. Occasionally, but not frequently, I can run a few times of the order of 10 before crashing.p  pFinally, if I comment out the codetxtInfogtclearcode line, then I can run the routine as much as I tried in one test I got tired after running it about 80 times.p  pMy only almost random guess is that the problem is somehow related to the update from the thread which emits a signal that is caught and in turn just calls the codeUpdateDisplaycode function. The reason I think so is that if I comment out the signals and just create a new button to call the codeUpdateDisplaycode with some bogus information, everything is fine.p  pA codeqAppgtprocessEventscode before the offending line has no effect.p  pI am stuck here. Any ideas are welcome. For instance, is there any test I can do to verify that calling the codeclearcode method is okp

Negative 57799 pI have a Values.java class that is tied to multiple activities. Values.java can obtain the current running activity and uses that to open up the options menu associated with that activity. Each activity has an item labeled start and cancel. How can this Values.java class call the start or cancel option of the current running activity The reason Im asking for this is because each activities start or cancel button are heavily integrated with its activity, i.e. one makes a thread, or is associated with values related to that activity. Im not sure if what Im asking for is possible on the android platform.p

Negative 57799 pI have an Adobe Air mobile application that communicates with Django via TastyPie. To use the app people have to register first. Therefore they have to supply their email and password. Afterwards they will be able to login. I thought it would be the best idea that after entering a successful usernamepassword combination, the apikey will be sent back to the mobile app where it will be cached, so the user is logged in.p  pPlease tell me if you think there is a better way for registering and logging in users.p  pInside Django I have a UserRessource class that I use to register new users when sending data via POSTp  precodeclass UserResourceModelResource     class Meta         allowedmethods  [get, post]         queryset  User.objects.all         resourcename  auth         authentication  Authentication         authorization  Authorization         fields  [username, email]      def objcreateself, bundle, requestNone, kwargs         username, email, password  bundle.data[username], bundle.data[password], bundle.data[password],          try             bundle.obj  User.objects.createuserusername, email, password         except IntegrityError             raise BadRequestThat username already exists         return bundle codepre  pThat works very well.p  pBut now Im struggling with the actual login process. In my opinion it would be best to send username and password via GET and https to this ressource and if those are valid, return the users api key. But would that be possible And is it clean Usually TastyPie would show all users currently in the DB if you send a GET request to that ressource. But I dont need that data, so I could overwrite that somehow. I already checked a hrefhttpdjangotastypie.readthedocs.orgenv0.9.9resources.htmlhttpdjangotastypie.readthedocs.orgenv0.9.9resources.htmla but I dont get it to work. Is it even possible to overwrite that behaviourp  pSo the actual questions are strongWhats the best way to sign in a user using ApiKeyAuthenticationstrong And strongIs my approach right and clean or do you have a better methodstrong and strongDo you have any examples for this casestrongp  pThanks alot in advancep

Negative 57799 pSo Im trying to reimplement the OAuth1 OAuthConsumer and OAuthServiceProvider samples from DotNetOpenAuth using MVC 4 Webapi instead of WCF. I have everything going up to the point in the Callback endpoint. When it makes the ProcessUserAuthorization call it seems to take a different path in the DotNetOpenAuth code in the MVC 4 version then it does in the sample. In the sample it makes a call to the DatabaseTokenManager.GetRequestToken method. However in the MVC 4 version it calls the GetAccessToken method. Im using the same Consumer project in each case. I copied the OAuth.ashx from the original sample to the MVC 4 version. I created a new token manager, using the same database but not using EntityFramework, Im using PetaPoco for DB access.  The question I have is why is this happening, and if anyone has done a sample of OAuth1 using MVC4WebApi. It would be nice to see this in action under current web frameworks.p  pHere is the call stack code

Negative 57799 pIm trying to implement a custom widget in wxWidgets version 2.8.12, essentially a modified single line wxTextCtrl. It takes a text input that consists of two sets of 8digit hexadecimal numbers separated by a space, and I want the control to automatically handle that space. For example, if the user types 18 in twice no press of the space bar required, the resulting contents of the text control should bep  precode12345678 12345678 codepre  pIf the user were to then place their cursor after the first 3 and backspace three times, that space should automatically adjust as they edit, resulting inp  precode45678123 45678 codepre  pEssentially, the space should be completely transparent to the user.p  pI have this, for the most part, done.

Negative 57799 pso basically I have a KML file that I load up, and I have 2 different sets of points that I present on there. However, I want to be able to present one set at a time, I figured the simplest way to do this is to split the set into 2 different KML files, and then load the appropriate file depending on set, or if there is another way of doing this, it could work for me as well. Thanks a lot.p

Negative 57799 pBefore you dismiss this question as a repeat, this question is different than the many other similar questions on SO because the strongfunctionstrong in the error message is strongcompletely unrelatedstrong to the strongDLLstrong.p  h3The app and version infoh3  pIve got a 32bit app in Visual Studio 2008 RTM which uses a MATLAB Compiler 4.17 R2012a generated DLL, Glib 2.32.4, binaries from GStreamer SDK 2012.9 32bit, and Qt 4.8.3vs2008, all running on Windows 7 x64 SP1.p  h3The problemh3  pThe strongdebug build runs finestrong, but in release I get the infamous codeThe procedure entry point libXXXInitialize could not be located in the dynamic link library libglib2.00.dll.code The bizarre thing is that this libXXXInitialize function which does exist in the MATLABbased DLL is strongtotally unrelatedstrong to libglib2.00.dll.p  h3My researchh3  pI checked the obvious, ensuring that all libraries were compiled with VS2008 except for GStreamerGLib which is compiled with mingw, but since its straight C there shouldnt be any issues, and checking for any other versions of the DLLs in the path. It seems like it must be some sort of linker problem.p  h3Update 1h3  pIn Dependency Walker x86, it shows this codelibXXXInitializecode as an unresolved parent import from not only libglib2.00.dll, but all the other GLibGStreamer DLLs as well, however the function is correctly resolved in the DLL where it should be found, libXXX.dll.p  h3Update 2h3  pI removed the call to codelibXXXInitializecode and called codemclInitializeApplicationcode from the MATLAB Compiler Runtime, and now that function is failing to be resolved from the glib DLL.p  pstrongHowever I found a solutionstrong at least temporary, changing the linker options from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybxwfs97628vvs.9029.aspx relnofollowcodeOPTREFcodea to codeOPTNOREFcode fixed the problem so the linker emkeeps functions andor data that are never referencedem. The bizarre thing is, I certainly use the codemclInitializeApplicationcode function explicitly, and if I turn on codeVERBOSEREFcode, it doesnt show it being removed.p  h3Update 3h3  pFinally found mention of this somewhere else, on the a hrefhttpsourceware.orgbugzillashowbug.cgiid12633 relnofollowbugtracker for binutilsa.

Negative 57799 pI am curious about the pros and cons of using user agent detection in a web server to determine which version of a JavaScript resource to send to the client.p  pIn particular, if some web browsers support a feature natively while others require a verbose JavaScript workaround, is it better to serve the workaround to everyone and run it only if its needed clientside, or to serve the workaround only to the browsers that require it and send a thin wrapper around native features to the restp  pWhat problems could arise with that second approach, and might they outweigh the benefit of smaller responses for the supporting browsersp
Negative 57799 pI have a couple of issues with SQLite query.

Negative 57799 pRight now as part of my android app I have a .csv file that contains aobut 15,000 lines stored on the sd card of the phone. Every time my app launches it reads in those 15,000 lines into two parallel arrays. I do this for 3 files so in total I have 6 arrays storing 15,000 elements each. I need to search through these items quickly while maintaining order.p  pIm worried if I keep the code the way it is Im going to start running out of memory on phones and having the app crash.

Negative 57799 pIm at the point where I think I should give up on this project. I have hit dead ends at every attempt.p  pThe basic concept is that I have an INI file that is read by my main page. My main page has two list boxes that get the option information from the INI file using php. When An option is selected in list box one, I call an on change java function that should change list box two.p  pI thought I could do this by having PHP create all the list boxes from the ini first, and have them set to displaynone. Then the Javascript would turn the display to Block, depending on the option selection in list box one.p  pThe problem I keep running into is Javascript not able to read directly from the INI, and PHP cannot do onclick events unless the whole page reloads.p  pIs this even possible to dop

Negative 57799 pI try if it possible to respect the Separation of concerns while programming in javascript and html. In many situations, I have to execute some code after the page is loaded and I use the document ready function of jQuery to do that. I prefer to put my javascript code in a separated file. The problem is that I have a script file that I use to a couple of html files and the document ready function should not be executed in all of these pages. For this reason, I put a script tag directly in my html and the document ready function in this tag but the rest of the javascript code is in my javascript file. p  pIs it a good practice to put the document ready function in the html to promote reusing the script file in different contexts or is there any good practices to achieve this problemp  pThank you.p

Negative 57799 pIve been investigating an issue in my DirectX 11 C application for over a week now, and so Im turning to the good people on StackOverflow for any insight that may help me track this one down.p  pMy application will run mostly at 6090 frames per second, but every few seconds Ill get a frame that takes around a third of a second to finish. After much investigation, debugging, and using various code profilers, I have narrowed it down to calls to the DirectX API. However, from one slow frame to the next, it is not always the same API call that causes the slowdown. In my latest run, the calls that stall always for about a fifth of a second are p  ul liID3D11DeviceContextUpdateSubresourceli liID3D11DeviceContextDrawIndexedli liIDXGISwapChainPresentli ul  pNot only is it not the same function that stalls, but each of these functions mainly the first two the slow call may be from various places in my code from one to the next. p  pAccording to multiple profiling tools and my own high resolution timers I placed in my code to help measure things, I found that this hiccup would occur at consistent intervals of just under 3 seconds 2.95.p  pThis application collects data from external hardware and uses DirectX to visualize that data in real time. While the application is running, the hardware may be idle or running at various speeds. The faster the hardware goes the more data is collected and must be visualized. I point this out because it may be useful when considering some of the characteristics of this bugp  ul liThe long frames dont occur while the hardware is idle. This makes sense to me because the software just has to redraw data it already has and doesnt have to transfer new data over to the GPU.li liHowever, the long frames occur at these consistent 3 second intervals regardless of the speed the hardware is running. So even if my application is collecting twice the amount of data per second, the frequency of the long frames doesnt change.li liThe duration of these long frames is very consistent. Always between 0.25 and 0.3 seconds I believe it is the slow call to the DirectX API that is consistent, so any variation on the overall frame duration is external to that call.li liWhile field testing last week when I first discovered the issue, I noticed that on a couple runs of the application, after a long time probably 20 minutes or more of continuous testing without interacting much with the program aside from watching it, the hiccup would go away. The hiccup would come back if we interacted with some features of the application or restarted the program. Doesnt make sense to me, but almost like the GPU figured out and fixed the issue but then reverted back when we changed up the pattern of work it had been doing previously. Unfortunately the nature of our hardware makes it difficult for me to replicate this in a lab environment.li ul  pThis bug is occurring consistently on two different machines with very similar hardware dual GTX580 cards. However, in recent versions of the application, this issue did not occur. Unfortunately the code has undergone many changes since then so it would be difficult to pinpoint what specific change is causing the issue.p  pI considered the graphics driver, and so updated to the latest version, but that didnt make a difference. I also considered the possibility that some other change was made to both computers, or possibly an update to  software running on both of them, could be causing issues with the GPU. But I cant think of anything other than Microsoft Security Essentials that is running on both machines while the application runs, and Ive already tried disabling its RealTime Protection feature to no avail.p  pWhile I would love for the cause to be an external program that I can just turn off, ultimately I worry that I must be doing something incorrectlyimproperly with the DirectX API that is causing the GPU to have to make adjustments every few seconds. Maybe I am doing something wrong in the way I update data on the GPU since the lag only happens when Im collecting data to display. Then the GPU stalls every few seconds and whatever API function that happens to get called during a stall cant return as fast as it normally wouldp  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanks, Timp  pstrongUPDATE 2013.01.21strongp  pI finally gave in and went searching back through previous revisions of my application until I found a point where this bug wasnt occurring. Then I went revision by revision until I found exactly when the bug started happening and managed to pinpoint the source of my issue. The problem started occurring after I added an unsigned integer field to a vertex type, of which I allocate a large vertex buffer. Because of the size of the vertex buffer, this change increased the size 184.65 MB 1107.87 MB to 1292.52. Because I do in fact need this extra field in my vertex structure, I found other ways to cut back on overall vertex buffer size, and got it down to 704.26 MB.p  pMy best guess is that the addition of that field and the extra memory it required caused me to exceed some thresholdlimit on the GPU. Im not sure if it was an excess of total memory allocation, or an excess of some limit to a single vertex buffer. Either way, it seems that this excess caused the GPU to have to do some extra work every few seconds maybe communicating with the CPU every few seconds, and so my calls to the API had to wait on this. If anyone has any information that would clarify the implications of large vertex buffers, Id love to hear itp  pThanks to everyone who gave me their time and suggestions. p

Negative 57799 pFiles are categorized by fileextension. So my question is, how to identify the file type even the file extension has been changed. p  pFor example, i have a video file with name codemyVideo.mp4code, i have changed it to codemyVideo.txtcode. So if i doubleclick it, the preferred text editor will open the file, and wont open the exact content. But, if i play codemyVideo.txtcode in a video player, the video will be played without any problem.p  pI was just thinking of developing an application to determine the type of file without checking the fileextension and suggesting the software for opening the file.

Negative 57799 pIm writing a memory manager.  I allocate a large chunk of dynamic memory and split it into various sized memory pools.  The size ranges from 8 to 256 in multiples of 8.  When a memory request comes, depending on the size, I allot a memory block from one of the pools.  I maintain a hash table that maps the required size and the memory pool.br I dont want to keep bookkeeping information in the allocated memory and so I use a singly linked list per each pool to keep track of the free blocks.   My question is i As the block size is uniform across all blocks in a memory pool, I have decided not to sort the blocks. i.e. When a memory request comes, Ill allocate the first block in the memory pool and when its freed, Ill insert it in the front of the free list.  This way, both memory allocation and freeing will be faster. Also, as the block size is the same in a pool, fragmentation wont occur.  Do you see any problem in thisp

Negative 57799 pI looked at several other questions to try to find an answer to this but I couldnt. Heres the thing, I have a emREALLYem big table that will keep growing indefinitely. When I say emBIGem I mean I have around 10 million rows for a query bounded for 6 hours of data. We have data for several months just so you can see how big it is. p  pWell, justified the size problem, I want to make a very simple query Group by a column and sum the values of another column. Out of that I want the biggest 10 sums, for example, and the sum of all other not in the top 10. I know there are ways of doing this, but I would like to do it without having to compute the totals table twice. For that I used Table variables. Im using SQL SERVER 2012. p  precodeDECLARE sumsTable TABLEoperationName varchar200, operationAmount int DECLARE topTable TABLEoperationName varchar200, operationAmount int DECLARE startTime DATETIME DECLARE endTime DATETIME DECLARE top INTEGER  SET top  10 SET endTime  03112013 SET startTime  03102013  grouping by operationName and summing occurences INSERT INTO sumsTable SELECT operationName, COUNT AS operationAmount FROM [f6f87bf033ab488286742cb31e5e49c4] WHERE TIMESTAMP gt startTime AND TIMESTAMP lt endTime GROUP BY operationName  selecting top ocurrences INSERT INTO topTable SELECT TOPtop  FROM sumsTable ORDER BY operationAmount DESC  Summing others and making union with top SELECT OTHER AS operationName, SUMoperationAmount as operationAmount FROM sumsTable WHERE operationName NOT IN SELECT operationName FROM topTable UNION SELECT  FROM topTable ORDER BY operationAmount DESC codepre  pMy question is fit this is a good way of doing it, if there are better ways, faster ways... am I committing any crimes Can I get rid of the table variables without making all the summations more then oncep

Negative 57799 pI am new in developing iOS apps.

When you choose the profile, you get into a menu where you have some different functionalities Once in this menu, I might use Navigation Controller.p  pMy problem is that I dont know how to manage these two first views. I dont know if I have to declare them in the appDelegate, or if I can do it nesting one to other, I mean, I do the first view, and when I pressed the button, I declare the new view. Once in the new view, when I pressed a row in the table view, I make the another view. p  pI know it is a little bit confusing, so I hope you could understand it quite well.p  pEDITp  pI want to clarify that I am not using storyboards. My main doubt is what to do with all de view controllers, Do I have to declare all of them in the appDelegate or Can I declare each view in every controllerp

Negative 57799 pBeen banging my head against the walls for just short of a week trying to wrap my head around Facebooks newest SDK for Android  3.0  , Seems to me Facebook has managed to overcomplicate something that wasnt broken in the first place.  p  pAll I want to do is make the code from onCreate work from onClick.The code for the activity ive written to get this far is below and yes, it does currently work upon launching. logs a user in ,makes a request to my api and does what its suppose to. p  pI dont need nor do I want to manage Facebooks sessions anymore than I absolutely have to , I simply want to let a user login using their fb credentials , open up a session , make a single request to grab the users info , send it up to my API and takeover using my own APIshared prefssessions. If its easier to point me in the direction of a snippet that would illustrate how i could do this w. the permissions ive set below vs. editing my activity that would more than answer my question as well.p  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.Arrays import java.util.HashMap import java.util.List  import org.json.JSONArray import org.json.JSONException import org.json.JSONObject

Negative 57799 pIm trying to make an executable from a couple ruby files on Windows, so I installed Ocra. I thought I understood the process of how Ocra works, but cant seem to get the executable working correctly. The problem I am having arises with requiring other ruby files.p  pThe ruby program by itself compiles correctly and functions how I want it to, and Ocra seems to create a working executable, however, when I attempt to run the executable, I get the following errorp  pcustomrequire.rb36in require cannot load such file  MainMenuDialog.rb LoadErrorp  pMy main program is called JobManager.rb and it is creating a new MainMenuDialog object, therefore I include MainMenuDialog.rb in the top of the file as suchp  precode ltlt File.expandpathFile.dirnameFILE  ..lib  Other requires here requireMainMenuDialog.rb codepre  pAgain, the program compiles and runs perfectly fine by itself including the require statements, and when I run the command emocra JobManager.rbem it successfully runs the programs, checks for dependencies, and creates the executable. I just cant run the executable because of the LoadError described above. p  pAny thoughts on what Im doing wrong Thanks in advancep

Negative 57799 pI want to have a worker thread that can 1 send messages to the UI thread to change things in the GUI, and 2 receive messages from the UI thread to control the worker threads behavior.p  pThe first part is easy Create a Handler in the UI thread and let the worker thread send messages to it. Works like a charm. The worker thread uses Thread.sleep to perform an efficient delay, wakes up to do things, sends an update to the UI threads Handler, and repeats.p  pThe next part is apparently difficult in Android. The worker thread must have a Looper to create a Handler so it can RECEIVE messages, and Looper.loop is a blocking call which means the worker thread is now 100 committed to running the Looper and cant do the other things it is currently doing do things, send update message, sleep, repeat.p  pThis implies I need a THIRD thread just to run the Looper for the worker thread, which is ridiculous. It should be possible to have the worker thread do useful things, AND process a message if and when one arrives. This yields an efficient system with the minimum number of thread objects and minimal overhead. I cant figure out how to implement this behavior in Android.p  pSo... how does a worker thread support a Handler and do anything else useful Thanksp

Negative 57799 pBasically I want to be able to click a div, have it move 50px to the left, click it again, have it move 50px down, click it again and move 50px to the right, and click it again and have it move back to its original position so that if I click it a 5th time the cycle starts over again. Ive read an entire book on jQuery but I am still very new to this. I tried using an if statement where it would check the css of the div and if it was such and such it would animate it to the correct position but the problem is, animating an object with jquery doesnt change its css, so I wouldnt be able to check its css the next time to animate it to the next position. Now, I may be on the totally wrong track with the if statement. I dont need someone to write my code for me, just looking for the correct IDEA. Is there a handler I should be aware of An event I need to catch How is this type of thing usually taken care of with jQueryp  pTo sum it up how do you make an object animate in a cyclical manner more than two animations upon successive clicks with jqueryp

That is problem 1.p  pBecause I didnt find a quick solution, I tried to add the image of the middle button not via codeSmallImageSourcecode, but by adding it as codeltImagegtcode for the content of the button. However, the button would remain empty. That is problem 2.p  pMy third solution was to add images to the left and the right button, too. Unfortunately there is nearly no margin between the image and text, which looks quite ugly. I tried several things to enlarge the margin like adding a codeltStyle TargetTypeImagegtcode to the codeltRibbonToggleButton.Resourcesgtcode, but although the emeditorem accepts it and displays the spacing at designtime, the margin is gone again at runtime. That is problem 3.p  pDoes anybody have an appropiate solution to any of the three problems I cannot get it to work. The number of the problems is also the preference of the alternatives, 1 being the most favourite to use with an appropiate hack.p

Negative 57799 pYes, this question has been answered in a variety of ways, none of which, are answered in a way that fit my needs.  So, therefore Im asking mine specific to my situation.p  pIve tried, probably 5 or 6 different ways for setting up a mail SMTP server on my spare computer at home that Ive also set to run my website.  My ISP blocks several ports like 80 and 25 that allow for hosting web servers, mail servers, ftp servers. etc.  Luckily, my domain registrar had a way to forward my traffic to a specific port where then I used some options in my router to do port translation and redirect traffic from one port specified in my account settings on my registrars site to go to port 80 on my web server computer, which worked just fine, and my website is up.  p  pHowever, Ive come to find out that by default, when setting up an MX record so I can set up a mail server, their system by default sends traffic to port 25. So rather than the web server pointer that I can specify  012.345.678.9108080, the MX record has to be something like mail.mydomain.com or simply mydomain.com.  There is no way in their options currently to specify a port like you can for the website.  So, I guess this is a 2 part question.  1.  Did I just happen to choose a crappy domain registrar or specifically, is this a capability offered by default by a lot of other domain registrars that Im just missing out on  and 2.  Is there any other way to make this happen  My ISP charges and arm and a leg for Business accounts that unlock port 25, and Id like to not have to go that route.  I understand you can set your SMTP server to listen and send out traffic on a different port, but that does me no good if my domain registrars MX record is still forwarding to port 25 for incoming mail.  Any help or advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.p  pEDITp  pI left out the obvious possibility that I could be messing up my setup in regard to the fact that Ive never successfully set up an SMTP server before so Im quite new to this.  With that sad, could I be confused on how mail servers operate, is there a difference or possibility of an ISP blocking incoming traffic on a port vice outgoing  What I mean is, am I confused in that if Ive set up everything properly, should I be able to receive listen or port 25 no matter what, and then have to send outgoing mail out on an unblocked smtp portp  pIve yet to try sending out mail from my server due to the fact that I dont want to have things set up wrong and then get my IP blacklisted, so Ive only tried experimenting with trying to receive email and as Ive said, Ive tried about 5 or 6 all very confusing and seemingly incomplete or not very detailed tutorials on how to set up an SMTP server, and I have yet to get incoming mail either.  As a personal note, it seems weird to me that out of the several tutorials Ive searched and read, that not one bares nearly any similarity to the next with regard to the first part of installing postfix from there, it all becomes different.  This doesnt help me understand what I could be doing wrong if indeed that is what is happening.  Finally just for continuity, I did go to a hrefhttpport25.icannotconnect.com relnofollowhttpport25.icannotconnect.coma and it did indeed say BLOCKED.p  pThanks again.p

It would throw IndexOutOfBoundsException for any other index that is out of bounds.p  pHowever, since elementDataindex access ap  precodeprivate transient Object[] elementData codepre  pI cannot make it work, because my class doesnt see it since its private.p  pAlso, I dont want to use any external libraries for this, simply because I think there are none that suit my needs, since I dont want a real circularArray, but only a part of its functionality, rest of it being of the regular ArrayList.p  pSo I have two questionsp  pHow can I make this work Is there a way to do it without copying the whole ArrayList class along with AbstractCollection, Collection and Iterable into my program That seems like bad design even to me.p  pIf I can somehow make it work, is there anything else I should watch for If I make the changes described above, would that change the behaviour of the class only the way I want it to, or could there be any other undesired behaviour changesp  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks for the answer, heres what Ive donep  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList  public class CircularArrayListltEgt extends ArrayListltEgt      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L      public E getint index              if index  1                      index  size1                   else if index  size                      index  0                   return super.getindex       codepre  pIt will wrap around the ArrayList, but only by one.

Negative 57799 pIm using OpenGL ES 2.0 to create the following scenep  pDraw a background image on the entire screen and above it draw another overlay image that fades in and out alpha changesp  pI also need to use codeScreen blendcode to blend the overlay and the background textures.  p  pSo I created a shader that blends the two textures, I thought that I can use a uniform coderandomAlphacode to change the overlay texture alpha over time and create a fade animation, but the following code doesnt do the trick, the overlay texture opacity doesnt changes  p  pI know there is an Alpha Blend that I can use to blend the overlay and the background textures, but the problem is that I want the final overlay after opacity changes to blend the background with a Screen Blend not an Alpha Blend p  pThis is how my fragment shader main method looks like  p  precode void main        mediump vec4 background  texture2DbackgroundTexture, backgroundCoords      mediump vec4 overlay  texture2DoverlayTexture, overlayCoords       overlay.a  randomAlpha        add overlay to background using screen blend      mediump vec4 whiteColor  vec41.0      glFragColor  whiteColor  whiteColor  overlay  whiteColor  background      codepre  pClearly I missing something important here..br How can I change the textures opacity how can I create the fade effectp

The relationships are based off the first matching node of each entry, NOT all the matching nodes.p  pIve modified the code, but I cannot seem to figure out why the graph does not render properly.  p  pThe section of the code that does this, is located between lines 64 through 128, located below.

Negative 57799 pI am trying to create a word game that can encrypt a word and shift the characters a certain number by what the user inputs, decrypt that encryption, and check if the word is a palindrome. The problem is I do not know how to keep the input going, so after i encrypt or check if it is a palindrome the program ends so i cannot decrypt what has been encrypted. p  pFor exampleIf the user inputs the word hello and selects to encrypt the word, with a key of 3 it should display khoor. Then i would like to be able to continue by decrypting khoor back to hello but the program ends.    p  pAlso the when the user inputs a key number, the characters shift 7 more characters than the input number. p  precodeimport java.util.Scanner  public class WordPlayTester  public static void mainString [] args  String word, reverse String original int key 0 String Menu 1Encrypt n2Decrypt n3Is Palindrome n0Quit nSelect an option  Scanner in  new ScannerSystem.in System.out.printlnType any word       String toUpperCase       word  in.nextLine System.out.printlnMenu     int choicein.nextInt    ifchoice1       System.out.printlnInsert a Key number    int select in.nextInt         for int i0 i lt word.length i           char c  word.charAti          if c gt A ampamp c lt z              c  charc  65             int n  cselect             n  n  26             if n lt 0                 n  n  26                          c  charn  65                    System.out.printc                     else ifchoice2       System.out.printlnInsert a Key number    int select2 in.nextInt         for int i0 i lt word.length i           char c  word.charAti          if c gt A ampamp c lt z              c  charc  65             int n  cselect2             n  n  26             if n lt 0                 n  n  26                          c  charn  65                    System.out.printc               ifkey0              System.out.printlnWord has not been encrypted yet.                else ifchoice3        int length  word.length       for  int i  length  1  i gt 0  i           reverse  reverse  word.charAti       if word.equalsreverse          System.out.printlnYour word is a palindrome.       else          System.out.printlnYour word is not a palindrome.                else ifchoice0              System.exit0              else               System.out.printlnMenu              codepre  pThank youp

Is there some CSS I can apply to make the box expand to fit its children, but also have codeoverflow visiblecodep  pNote that codeoverflow autocode just creates scrollbars, which is no good either.p

A common response is Never use codeeval orcodeexec they are evil, but I really like the power and flexibility of executing the code.  Using codebuiltins Nonecode I dont think will work for me as I will want to import other modules e.g. codeimport numpy as npcode in my above code. A number of people e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma95580012530083herea suggest using the codeastcode module but I am not at all clear on how to use itcan codeastcode be used with codeexeccode. Is there simple ways to whitelistallow specific functionality e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10661079restrictingpythonssyntaxtoexecuteusercodesafelyisthisasafeapproachherea Is there simple ways to blacklistdisallow specific functionality  Is there a magic way to say execute this but dont do anythinh nasty.p  pBasically what are the options for making sure codeexeccode doesnt run any nasty malicious codep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMy example above of normalising an array within my inputconfiguration file is perhaps a bit simplistic as to what computations I would want to perform within my inputconfiguration file I could easily write a methodfunction in my program to do that.  But say my program calculates a property at various times.  The user needs to specify the times in some way. Should I only accept a list of explicit time values so the user has to do some calculations before preparing the input file note even using a list as configuration variable is not trivial a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma67592562530083see herea. I think that is very limiting.  Should I allow startendstep values and then use codenumpy.linspacecode within my program  I think that is limiting too whatif I want to use codenumpy.logspacecode instead  What if I have some function that can accept a list of important time values and then nicely fills in other times to get well spaced time values.  Wouldnt it be good for the user to be able to import that function and use it  What if I want to input a list of user defined objects  The thing is, I dont want to code for all these specific cases when the functinality of python is already there for me and my user to use.    Once I accept that I do indead want the power and functionality of executing code in my inputconfiguration file I wonder if there is actually any difference, security wise, in using codeexeccode vs using codeimportlibcode vs a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma676922530083imp.loadsourcea and so on.  To me there is the limited standard configparser or the all powerful, all dangerous exec.  I just wish there was some middle ground with which I could say execute this... without stuffing up my computer.p

Negative 57799 pstrongBackgroundstrongbr Some time ago I asked a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18291829efficientmanipulationofalistofcartesiancoordinatesinpythonherea regarding the most efficient method for finding the neighbours of every point   in a set of data by comparing each point against every other.

Negative 57799 pIm currently making a drawing app, which Im using a story board so i can implement a game with it was well.

Negative 57799 pI have a ViewControllerA that has roughly 15 buttons in my case they represent levels, When a level is pressed it segues to ViewControllerB. Now it doesnt make sense to manually ctrldrag and create segue for each button.

Negative 57799 pIm looking for a way to improve the following query.p  pIt collects members of organizations that have a membership of any organization in 2013. p  pIve been able to determine that the subquery in this query is the real performance killer, but I cant find a way to remove the subquery and keep the resulting table correct.p  pThe query simply collects all PersonID and MemberId for people that have a membership in this calendar year.

Negative 57799 pI need to learn how to change a transliteration of a text to another writing system. Apparently the best way would somehow involve regular expressions and perl, probably from command line Ive been using regular expressions earlier in Notepad and TextWrangler, so I know some basics already. If there is some really good and relatively easy and customizable way to do this in Ruby or something else, I can start learning that as well. There is a constant need to transliterate linguistic sample texts in my field in Uralic linguistics, where many different variants of transliteration systems are used. So it is worth investing some time.p  pSo the material I have now consists of lines with a sentence on each line. Some lines have other data like numbers, but those should stay as they are. I want to keep the punctuation marks as they are, this is just about converting one set of unicode letter characters to another. I searched the site but a lot was about converting from ascii to unicode and so on  this is not the problem here.p  pSo the original text is like this in broad FinnoUgric Transcriptionp  precodemdis ivan velyny peora ctvdnej kurs vyl. codepre  pAnd I would need it in a form like thisp  precodei      . codepre  pThis continues for some thousand lines.p  pThere is a clear correspondence between characters used, but it is sometimes complex and involves dealing first with some digraphs and consonant  vowel combinations, etc. As you see from the example, in some situations latin i corresponds to cyrillic  but in some positions can remain as i. Different texts have different solutions, so I would need to adjust the rules in each case. I understand I would need to run a long series of regular expressions in a very specific order to make it work. This order I will figure out myself, but I need to know into what kind of tool I have feed these rules in and how to do it.p  pI also have often situations where I would like to have the original sentence and transliterated one separated by a tab, so that the lines would have a form like thisp  precodemdis ivan velyny peora ctvdnej kurs vyl.    i       . codepre  pOf course there are many more questions, but after learning these basics I think I can move forward independently.

Negative 57799 pIve been working on this VBA code for a while and since Im a complete noob I feel like I havent gotten anywhere. Ive been researching a ton, but cant seem to combine answers to help with my scenario.p  pEssentially what Im trying to do is grab data, line by line, from one worksheet and extrapolate it to another worksheet. I believe this will involve loops and Im so new with VBA I dont know how to do it. p  pHeres the logic Im attempting For each row on worksheet 1, I would like to perform 3 different copy and paste activities to worksheet 2 and then it will loop down to the next row on sheet1 and do the 3 activities and so on. This will continue downwards until column A is blank in sheet1. Sheet1 data starts at A3 and sheets2 paste area starts at A2.p  pThe first activity is to copy cells F3,D3,A3, and H3 in that order so F3 will be A2, D3 will be B2 etc from sheet 1 to sheet 2 to A2,B2,C2, etc. A destination functions cant be used because I need just the values and no other formatsone of the many issues Ive ran in to.p  pThe next activity is to copy cells F3,D3,A3 and I3 from sheet 1 to sheet2  pasted below the previous copy and pasteagain no formats just values. Also to note, some of these may be blank except A column but I still need that row there with at least column A datathis goes to say with all these activities.p  pThe third activity is to copy and paste sheet1s F3,D3, and A3 a certain number of times referencing K3s numberand each copy and paste will be in the next available blank cell. So if the number in K3 it will look like it created 3 rows in sheet2totaling 5 rows on sheet2 since activity1 and 2 each create their own row.p  pAfter these three activities are completed for row 3 on sheet 1, it will then move to row 4 and do the previous three activities and paste to sheet2. And again it will be pasting no formats and in the next blank row on sheet 2. Also again, this loop will stop once the cell in Column A is blank.p  pBelow is my incomplete code.

Negative 57799 pAlright I am in a rather difficult situation, or at least I think so anyway. I have been doing some research on how to fix my problem but have really come up empty handed.p  pI need to be able to reindex the rowid of my table after I delete a row. That way at any given time when I want to update or index a row by the rowid it is accessing the correct one.p  pNow for those of you asking why. Basically I am interfacing a homebrewed db that was programmed in C and is really just a bunch of memory locations all accessed like they were a db table. So what Im trying to say is they can look up a row by searching for a value in the table, or by simply saying i want row 6. Lastly the table could consist of really anything, and any values which means they dont create a column as an index and ultimately the only thing for me to index their row by row number is the rowid to my knowledge.p  pSo I have found that VACUUM would do what I want or need but it appears that the system that database is in isnt giving sqlite privileges to write so when VACUUM is run it comes back with and error. ERROR 14 or Unable to open the database file I also know that my db is open so that isnt the issue but not having write privileges is the only reason I can come up with I have also read some stuff about the auto increment or something like that but didnt really understandthink that was going to be able to fix my problem.p  pAny suggestions or ideas from the sqlite or database geniuses out that would be appreciated. p

Negative 57799 pFigured this out in excel  just need to convert it to SQL  thought I would write this here in case anyone has looked at this and started to reply.p  pIm currently looking at outstanding orders and future estimated deliveries for a range of products where there can be multiple orders and deliveries.  I have a large table  see imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLIORz.jpg altp  pI have no reputation so unable to paste an image in here and Im unable to draw it out using spaces,p  pA positive in the Quantity column represents a reserved order from a priority area that has first pick when any future order comes in.  Similarly a negative represents a delivery For example if we look at product Ap  pstrongWeek 1strong  There is a priority order for 60.p  pstrongWeek 2strong  40 are delivered meaning 40 are allocated to the 60 in priority order week 1 still 20 outstanding.p  pstrongWeek 3strong  A New Priority order takes effect for 20 combining with the 20 outstanding from Week 2 to create 40p  pstrongWeek 3strong  at the same time in week 3 an order comes in for 50  this can satisfy the current outstanding request for 40 leaving 10 left overp  pstrongWeek 5strong  A new priority order take effect for 20, taking the 10 remaining and creating an outstanding order of 10.p  pIve been looking for a way to nicely look at the effect of the priority orders such that the estimated quantity and therefore cost can be seen. i.e. for product Ap  pstrongWeek 1strong  Initial Demand for 60   can be ignored as nothing deliveredp  pstrongWeek 2strong  40 delivered        40 at costp  pstrongWeek 3strong  40 delivered        40 at costp  pstrongWeek 5strong  10 delivered        10 at costp  pI think there may be an easy solution but having been looking at it for a while now I cant see the wood from the trees.   I think there is an issue with when a large enough order comes in and there is sufficient quantity to cover the priority order yet the remaining has effectively been reserved by the priority department and needs to be rolled over. Any help or prompts much appreciatedp

The UIWebView appears the way I want, perfectly underneath the translucent navigation bar, however when you refresh the UIWebView, it jumps up 64 pixels every time, eventually returning to the top of the web page if you hit refresh enough times.p  pI already know this is caused by the UIWebView scrollview inset to be set automatically by the storyboard, but I want to leave that be as I like having the UIWebViews content flow underneath the translucent navigation bar.p  pIs there a way I can fix this 64 pixel jump up every time without the user seeing it happen Basically when the user taps refresh, it should refresh to that position of the page and not jump anymore.p  pI appreciate any help offered.p

The problem is that the elements that get moved to the right push the edge of the page off to the right so the user could scroll to the right and see nothing but whitespace.p  pIm using the TweenMax library.p  pHere is my HTMLp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classlogocircles idlogo1gtltimg srcimglogo01.pnggtltdivgt     ltdiv classlogocircles idlogo3gtltimg srcimglogo03.pnggtltdivgt     ltdiv classlogocircles idlogo2gtltimg srcimglogo02.pnggtltdivgt     ltdiv classlogocircles idlogo4gtltimg srcimglogo04.pnggtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd the matching CSS...p  precode.logocircles      textaligncenter     margintop50px   .logocircles img      width250px     heightauto     opacity0.8    Set height adjustments  logo2, logo3, logo4      margintop250px    set horizontal position adjustments  logo1      marginleft600px   logo2      marginleft200px   logo3      marginright200px   logo4      marginright600px  codepre
Negative 57799 pI have some questions on the transports tab on a proxy service. I explain   in my proxy service A, i have a publish component to call an asynchronous jms based service, called B. p  pThe service B reads the message, sent by the publish component, in a jms queue. For example  jmslocalhost7001interne.queuep  pthe problem is the publish component never post the message on the queue if the protocol of the transport configuration on the service A is set to http. But if i change this setting to local all works fine. p  pDid any one can explain how this works please  p

Negative 57799 pIn my project Im using Neo4js CoreAPI through codeGraphDatabaseServicecode. In Tests we have an codeEmbeddedGraphDatabasecode where everything works as expected. I then wrote some tests to see how my implementation behaves on a codeRestGraphDatabasecode, just to find out, that most of it fails The GraphDatabaseService is obtained by GraphDatabaseFactory of the RestAPI, so without an codeinstanceofcode check I do not know which one it is Some examplesp  pIf I use codeGlobalGraphOperationscode everything will fail, because GlopalGraphOperations are not supported by the codeRestGraphDatabasecode. Strange enough that codeGlobalGraphOperations.atcode doesnt throw but all methods from GlobalGraphOperations.p  pThen I thought ok Ill use Cypher to get the same behavior.  I tryed to implement a Method like thisp  precodepublic getNodesWithLabelString label, GraphDatabaseService graphService     tryTransaction tx graphService.beginTx         ExecutionEngine ee  new ExecutionEnginegraphService         throws NullPOinterExeption in execute method         ExecutionResult result  ee.executeMATCH n  label   RETURN n         result.columnAsn         ... mapping of Nodes       codepre  pSearching through the API I see, that there is a codeRestCypherQueryEnginecode which is initialized via a codeRestAPIFascadecode. Problem here is, that the methods are not interchangeable, do not implement the same interface, and the return types are completeley different i.e. codeExecutionResultcode vs codeQueryResultcodep  pSo my question is Is there a way, to get the same behavior from Neo4j where the used technology Rest vs. Embedded doesnt matter Some kind of a technology independed Wrapper will suit my needs.p  pby the way, Im using Neo4j in Version 2p

I need to add a tolerance.p  pIs there a way to do a deep equals with a tolerancep  pThe only way right now I have found is to iterate over every single node, check if it is a number, and do a tolerance check instead of an equals. But this method is quite bulky because you have to check whether the node is an object, an array, a string... etc... and do specific things for each. I just want custom behavior for Numbers.p  pIs there a more elegant way of doing this Any 3rd party librariesp

Negative 57799 pIm having a problem with correctly building a container that stores class specimens of different types that are all inheritors of a single abstract class. The registerthe container stores a pointer to the array of these specimens, that has the type of the abstract class. Whenever I try to access data contained in the specimens I only succeed in retrieving parts that can be found in the base class too. For example, an overloaded ltlt used on the register that contains elements of all three inheritors, will only write the abstract class parts on screen, and will neglect anything not present there. Now I dont really know if the problem is with printing out the otherwise correctly stored elements, or the storing is already done in an inappropriate form, so that would be my question how should this be done properly Heres the codep  precodeclass Register private int elementNum type  pData friend stdostream ampoperatorltltstdostream amp os,const Register ampv  class type int a int b  class type2 public type int c int d  codepre  pThe other two inheritors behave the same way as the type2.

Negative 57799 pI have a context menuitem which is activated if an image is rightclicked, the exact same way that codecontextcopyimagecode is activated.p  pIs it possible to tiepair that menuitem to the codecontextcopyimagecode therefore eliminating the need to add extra duplicate eventlisteners and showhide handlersbr Adding an observer to codecontextcopyimagecode defeats the purposep  pIf not, is it possible to use the eventlistener that codecontextcopyimagecode usesp  pUpdatebr I am trying to reduce listeners. At the moment, script has a codepopupshowingcode listeners. On codepopupshowingcode, it checks for codegContextMenu.onImagcode and if true, it shows the menuitem. Firefoxs codecontextcopyimagecode does the exact same thing. I was wondering if it was possible to tie these 2 in order to removereduce the inscript event listeners.p  pI was also chatting with Dagger and he said thatp  blockquote   p... the state of builtin items isnt set from an event handler, its   set from the constructor for nsContextMenu, and there are no   mechanisms to hook into itp blockquote  pSo it seems, that is not possiblep

Negative 57799 pIve recently made a selenium script to automate the process of generating testdata through a webpage in Firefox.

Negative 57799 pi have made a flip using css3 transitions and it was working great until i introduced bootstrap popover to it. Actually at first i had no problem with popover too, it was cooperating with the flip just fine. p  pI have a flip which contains a wrapper. this wrapper has two panels, one panel contains a form and other panel contain a button which flips the whole wrapper and the other side can be seen which also has the similar structure. and my popover is for form validation. now it was working fine and then one fine day it started behaving differently. i have not changed my code. Popover is working fine but now i click on the button to flip it is not flipping and the weirdest part is when i try the same thing with 3 or 4 attempts it works finep  phow can that be possiblep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pactually when i click on textbox to get a popover and then click outside to hide it, after this when i try to click the button which makes the flip it dont work. strongBUTstrong when i do the same process again flip button works.p  pstrongALSOstrong when i dont use the popover flip works fine.p

Negative 57799 pIm new to databases, so I apologize in advance for a noob question.p  pI need to plan a database logging print jobs performed by some printers. These printers come in multiple versions, and each version may produce different sets of fields in the job log. However, some of these fields will be the same in logs produced by all printer versions. A very simplified example would be p  pPrinter version 1.0 may produce log record with the following fields [Job ID], [Date], [Printer Version], [Media Height], [Media Width]p  pWhile version 2.0 may produce these [Job ID], [Date], [Printer Version], [Cyan Toner Used mg], [Magenta Toner Used mg], [Yellow Toner Used mg], [Black Toner Used mg]p  pAll this log data should be saved in the same database and the users may run queries on only one printer version, on several or even on all printer versions for example, a query asking to return all jobs within a certain time period, regardless of the printer or its version. In addition, there will be some calculations, of various percentages, etc.p  pNew printer versions may appear in the future, each with its set of fields, and it is currently unknown which fields will stay common among all the printers.p  pHow should I approach this This is not a traditional EmployerEmployee database scenario, since were dealing here with basically the same conceptual objects print job records, with slight variations thereof. So should I...p  ol li...create a single database for all printer versions But then there will be nulls in fields for printers that dont provide data for these fields.li li...define a table for each printer version But then there will be identical fields appearing in all of them like [Date]. Wouldnt that be kind of wastefulli li...define a core table containing all common fields [Job ID], [Date], [Printer Version] in the example plus other tables one for each version containing the fields unique to that version But which fields will be common in the future is unknown.li liany other ideasli ol  pOf course I need to take into consideration performance issues, since these tables will grow very large over time millions of records. Not many users though. And... Im doing all of this on Access.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 57799 pIm looking to implement a threadsafe task queue in WP8. Basically it can even just be a list of actions. Im not sure what best practices are for making this happen.

The tasks being ran are mobile service requests and I want to avoid using the same mobile service class instance at the same time.p

Negative 57799 pMy VB.NET application uses config.xml file to store all configurations. This file is written often every 20 seconds or so as it also stores state of users session etc. From time to time, users report this file to be suddenly of zero length or full of unknown characters and application is thus not executable.p  pI tracked the problem to find out that this happens when file is written short before power failure or even normal shutdown . I tested it with notepad   I edited the file and unplugged power cord immediately after editing, then after reboot, file was corrupted. File is usually empty after initiating system shutdown, or it is full of zeros bitwise after power outage. So this doesnt look like issue of my application, but rather general OS or diskFS issue.p  pThis is happening on more than ten different PCs. All have Win7, NTFS, some have SSD disk, some not.p  pCan this be prevented Can I ensure that file contains either data before the edit or data after the edit, but never ends up in corrupted statep
Negative 57799 pIve recently noticed a significant performance issue with my app. I essentially have the following layout... img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAumKQ.png altenter image description herep  pstrongDESCRIPTIONstrong brIn short, there is a codeViewPagercode that holds 3 codeRelativeLayoutcodes as pages. Inside each page there a number of codeTextViewcodes. I recently noticed a lot of lag when I type into the codeEditTextcode that has a codeTextWatchercode on it to perform a quick SQL query for autocompleting. My HTC One M8 stutters and lags as I input text, but I know it isnt the querying that is slow because I measured queries taking only about 7 ms.p  pI used method profiling, Systrace, and plain old codeLogcode debugging and concluded that each time I typed a character in the codeEditTextcode about strong1,700strong calls to codeonMeasurecode were being made on the codeTextViewcodes within codeRelativeLayoutcode A, B, and C. Cumulatively, there are only about 15 independent codeTextViewcodes across the pages. I noticed that strongeach codeonMeasurecode is being called hundreds of times instead of just once or twicestrong like it usually might.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong brI dont know why typing in the codeEditTextcode in page B would cause other codeTextViewcodes in pages A and C to also get remeasured. More importantly, does anyone have insights on why codeonMeasurecode is being called so often And, does anyone know of a solution to significantly reduce the number of calls to codeonMeasurecodep  pstrongDETAILSstrong brThis may help I was actually able to cut the the number of codeonMeasurecode calls to about 900, by removing codeRelativeLayoutcode 2 which could suggest the propagation of codeonMeasurecode calls starts outside of the codeViewPagercode.p

Negative 57799 pIm trying to use .NET Remoting Client Activated Objects in order to keep clients authentication information during multiple calls instead of implementing a session management system which requires client sends session id in each call. As MSDN statesp  blockquote   pWhen the client submits a request for a server object using new operator, an activation request message is sent to the remote application.

Thank you for the answers in advancep
Negative 57799 pIm new to this, so please bear with me. Ill do my best to provide as much information as possible.p  pI have a system which is using Entity Framework 6.1.1, jQuery UI Combined Library 1.11.1, and ASP.Net MVC 5.1.2 Database First. I have implemented FullCalendar version 2.0.4 by Adam Shaw, into my project which has to read events from the database and display it on the calendar. The way I have coded it is mainly for testing purposes before I use it properly, so I havent really adhered to any naming conventions. I have searched through many websites looking for answers and I havent found any so far.p  pI am having a couple of problems with this though, but Im not sure if I should ask both here or separate them into different threads. Firstly, all my events seem to be showing at the exact current date and time. For example, if I have event A which should show on 20140824 and event B which should show on 20140826, as stated in the database, when I run the application, they would all show at 2001 20140827 the time i just typed out that text.p  pSecondly, my events arent draggable or droppable at all. See below for the code.p  pThis code is in my Model Classp  precodepublic partial class Event      public Event              this.Bookings  new HashSetltBookinggt         this.EventTags  new HashSetltEventTaggt           public int EventID  get set      public string EventName  get set      public string EventDays  get set      public NullableltSystem.TimeSpangt EventStart  get set      public NullableltSystem.TimeSpangt EventEnd  get set      public Nullableltdecimalgt EventDuration  get set      public Nullableltintgt NumberOfEmployees  get set      public string EventLocation  get set      public string EventDescription  get set      public Nullableltintgt EventRating  get set      public Nullableltintgt QuestionnaireID  get set      public NullableltSystem.DateTimegt EventDateCreated  get set      public NullableltSystem.DateTimegt EventDateUpdated  get set      public string EventSupplier  get set      public string EventPicture  get set       public virtual ICollectionltBookinggt Bookings  get set      public virtual Questionnaire Questionnaire  get set      public virtual ICollectionltEventTaggt EventTags  get set   codepre  pThe dates that I am pointing to in the database is EventDateCreated and EventDateUpdated. I am using EventDateCreated as start and EventDateUpdated as end.p  hr  pThis is the code that is in my controllerp  precodepublic JsonResult GetSchedules           var calendarObjects  new Listltobjectgt         double start         double end           foreach var item in db.Events                        start  ToUnixTimestampConvert.ToDateTimeitem.EventDateCreated             end  ToUnixTimestampConvert.ToDateTimeitem.EventDateUpdated              calendarObjects.Addnew                              id  item.EventID,                 title  item.EventName,                 Start  start,                 End  end,                 allDay  false                                return JsoncalendarObjects.ToArray, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet        private static long ToUnixTimestampDateTime date              var ts  date.ToUniversalTime.Subtractnew DateTime1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0         return longMath.Truncatets.TotalSeconds      codepre  pThe code shown here is looping through the database class Events, and getting all the event details. EventDateCreated and EventDateUpdated is sent to the method ToUnixTimestamp which converts the date into a UnixTimestamp, which then goes back to the GetSchedules method and assigns those dates to the calendarObjects list. Once all the details are assigned, it goes to the return code to send it to the view, which will then render the details on the calendar. Up to that return code, when hovering over the calendarObjects.ToArray, it shows all three events in my database, with all their details, including the different dates for each event.p  hr  pThis is the code in my Index viewp  precodeltscriptgt      document.readyfunction e           calendar.fullCalendar              header                  left prev,next today,                 center title,                 right month,agendaWeek,agendaDay             ,             defaultView month,              allDaySlot false,             timeFormat Hmm,             editable true,             disableDragging false,             droppable true,             selectable true,             slotMinutes 15,             dayClick function date, allDay, jsEvent, view                  createEventdate             ,             events EventsGetSchedules,                       ltscriptgt codepre  pFinally, the details are sent to this view, the Index view, which then renders the calendar. However, as mentioned, all the events are shown on the same day at exactly the same time as when i ran the application as shown in the link belowp  pa hrefhttppho.to6uuhO relnofollowCalendar Viewap  pWhy arent the events showing on their respective dates, and why cant I drag and drop themp

Negative 57799 pOk, here is the problem...p  pI store all my saved workouts in the Google Datastore as Text objects. When I view my saved workouts, the server returns all of the saved workouts in a big Array of JSON objects.  I parse these and display them by name on my JSP page.p  pAll works fine.p  pNow if I want to use a saved workout again, I simply pull that workouts JSON from the Array, and use jQuery ajax to call a servlet which forwards to showWorkout.jsp to display the workout again using the JSON passed in.p  pThe problem seems to be that an ajax call requires a callback.  Is this correctp  pAs you can see, Im trying to forward to showWorkout.jsp from the servlet I passed the JSON into.  The callback seems to be preventing this.  The showWorkout.jsp never shows and the current page does not change.p  pCan I use the callback to call the showWorkout.jsp and include the JSON to display the workout  I would rather NOT have the entire JSON as a query parameter in the URL.p  pOR... can I disable the callback and allow the servlet to forward to the JSPp  pThanksp

Also, I need to identify IDs that are present in Table2 but missing from Table1 and mark a column in Table 2 so that it indicates a missing entry.p  pBoth the tables are identical in their structure Number of columns,the column names, the indexes.p  pMy idea is to do the followingp  ul liFor each record in table 2, find its existence in table 1 this could be done by writing a query If the record with this ID does not exist in table 1, mark this record with a flag to indicate its invalid entry.  If the record with this ID exists in table 1, overwrite the entry in table 2 with entry in table 1. Also, maintain this ID information in some data structure. After iterating through all the records in table 2, write a query that will fetch records from table 1 such that the ID maintained in the above mentioned data structure is not part of Table 1. Insert these records into Table 2 now.li ul  pEnd result should be like thisp  pTable 2 p  precodeID FieldA   FieldB 10   Z         V  gt This row will be marked with a flag to indicate its an invalid entry 8    K         L  gt This row will be marked with a flag to indicate its an invalid entry 1    X         Y 2    C         D 3    E         F 4    G         H 5    I         J     codepre  pThere can be millions of records in both the tables.

Negative 57799 pI have an offline webapp which has to play audio files offline. The links to the audio files are served by using an ajax call to a php script in the server. The audio files itself would be stored in the server and would be downloaded from the links to the app if it is online.p  pThe webapp itself can be run online or offline. In online mode, it calls the php script to get the audio links and has to cache all the audio files.

Im not sure if localstorage supports audio, and Im not sure if cache manifest can be dynamically made from an ajax call.p  pWhat would be a good way to go about doing thisp

Negative 57799 pDoes anybody know what the setting is to allow VBA access to the fields in the Forms underlying DAO Recordset please I know this is possible as evidenced by the answer at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma19018261470014httpstackoverflow.coma19018261470014ap  pFor some reason I am no longer able to use the field names of the underlying DAO recordset which happens to be a query in my VBA code. p  pSo I used to be able to do p  pcodemyvalue  FieldNamecode p  prather than p  pcodemyvalue  Me.Recordset.FieldsFieldName.Valuecodep  pI realise this probably isnt the best practice but I have a lot of legacy code working like this and now the database forms are regularly falling over so Im faced with a massive unexpected clean up job to get it working again.p  pI thought I was imagining it so I restored an old copy of the database and sure enough I am able to use the fieldname on its own but not in the latest version. The only thing I can think of that has changed is that the database got corrupted by someone inadvertently working on it in Access 2010 so I created a new database and imported all of the objects from the old one. I have checked the VBA libary references and Options and they are identical. This makes me think it must be a database setting but I have been through them all and cant see any differences.p  pAlso Intellisense used to list the underlying fieldnames along with the regular form controls but this is no longer the case either.p  pUpdate  I have found that codemyvalue  MeFieldNamecode works but for some reason I used to be able to do codemyvalueFieldNamecode but that if I do that the value is always codeEmptycode.p

Negative 57799 pSo I have looked through a bunch of questions on Stack Overflow and other parts of the Internet, and I cannot seem to find any related topics to my problem.

Negative 57799 pI have a question on databases and how information is displayed in regards to Primary and Foreign keys.p  pFor example, there are three tables codeEmployeescode, codeEmployeeticketscode and codeEmployeecommentscode.  Each codeemployeecodecan have multiple codeticketscode and also multiple codecommentscode.  A foreign key is placed in the Employee tickets and Employee Comments table.  My application is built in vb.net with Visual Studio and it is a desktop application.  How can I query say.. Employee Name Jon Doe and display all of his tickets in a grid as well as all of the comments people have made on him over time  I have created a View on the sql database which returns all of the information I require but for each ticket listed under Jon Doe the View displays and Employee Name for every single ticket.  Is there a way to display the employee name only once and then every ticket listed under that particular individual without displaying the Employee Name again or do I have to make Separate windows to segregate all of this  p  pThis seems like a really dumb question and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to correctly display what is required in this situation.p  pHere is an example of what I am trying to explainimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comojViM.png altenter image description herep  pSo for troy there is one employee name entered in the Employee Names table, There is one CWB ticket entered in the CWB table but there are TWO PQ Cards entered in the PQR Ticket table.   How Can I Display    only one row for Troy and one Row for his CWB because there are only one of each entered in the tables then the two rows for the PQR Cards under his name  p  pI have created a view which gathers this information all into the one single view itself then bound the datagridviews to this View. p

When I start scrolling down nothing remarkable should happen until the bottom of the shorter div touches the bottom of they viwing area.p  pIn this moment this shorter div must freeze and as I keep scrolling down it should always be docked to the bottom of the viewing area.p  pAt this moment, if I start scrolling up the shorter div sgould undock and keep scrolling until its upper edge touches the upper border of the viewing port.p  pAs a summary the longest div should be scrollable naturally but the shorter div should never disappear from view and this is accomplished by docking it to the lower or upper edge of the window.p  pHere is a semi working solution that I came up with a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLaod7wLr relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netLaod7wLrap  precode    ltdiv classparentgt     ltdiv idcol1gt          Header         ltdiv classcontentgt ltdivgt         Footer     ltdivgt     ltdiv idcol2gt         Header         ltdiv classcontentgt ltdivgt         Footer     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pand CSSp  precode.parent     positionrelative   col1, col2     width350px     colorwhite     displayinlineblock     positionabsolute  col1     backgroundgrey   col2     backgrounddarkgrey     right0   col1 .content     height2000px   col2 .content     height1600px  codepre  pMy idea was to detect the shortest div touches one of the edgest of the viewing area and then adjust its position to FIXED. When a croll direction changed I bring it back to ABSOLUTEp  pI succesfully detect OnScrollUpDown events and make proper checks but when I change positions of the element form FIXED to ABSOLUTE I get a jumpy behavior.p  pI start wondering if this approach with juggling FIXEDABSOLUTE is the a correct one. Maybe there is a plug in that would accomplish this behavior. p  pAny help would be highly appreciated. p

Negative 57799 pI have a situation where we are using jersey client to request for updating a project specific database value and once this is completed, we assert the response to be a HTTP.OK. A subsequent API invocation is performed to check if the value has been updated and used for assertion. The steps arep  ol liInvoke a postget call   For actions say adding a commentli liAssert for a HTTP.OK on the response which is received immediatelyli liAssert for the action for which the postget call was invoked using appropriate methods to check say, comment has been updatedli ol  pIssue now is that this flow passes when we run the test individually, but in an environment, where there are parallel tests which are running I am talking about close to 8000 tests it is seen that the step 2 assertion passes but the step 3 assertion fails intermittently. p  pI am suspecting that the server is handling the request asynchronously and the step 2 assertion of HTTP.OK does not essentially mean that the comment was updated successfully. This may be because the assertion was performed much before the backend could complete the update. p  pWe have seen that adding a sleep between step 2 and 3 has helped, but is there any cleaner way to handle this I cannot give details if the server side code uses Suspended to handle this process as I do not have access to the code. p  pDo comment in if you feel that the information is inadequate, I am starting on jersey for the first time and may not have expressed the problem accurately. p
Negative 57799 pIm more of a designer than a coder, so apologies if this question seems boneheaded and the answer obvious. p  pAnyway, with that caveat out of the way... Im trying to create a page where the images are in a row that extend off the right edge of the screen, so that the user can scroll to see more images. Other interface elements like the logo and nav are fixed in place.p  pYou can see the page here a hrefhttpwerewolf.phantomlimb.net relnofollowhttpwerewolf.phantomlimb.netap  pand the CSS here a hrefhttpwerewolf.phantomlimb.netwolf.css relnofollowhttpwerewolf.phantomlimb.netwolf.cssap  pTo remove the spaces between the images I have floated them left.p  pMy question is that in order to prevent the images from wrapping, even with a height attribute on the container div and display block I have to give the div a width value, in this case 4000px. A width of auto for example makes the images wrap onto a new line, which is what I emdontem want p  pAs I may not always know the exact width of the combined images, is there a width value I can use that will force the images to stay in a single row, or some other CSS trick p  pMany thanks. p  pJp

Negative 57799 pWhat i mean by the title is we have a system with different submodules, each with their own MVC web application. I thought about creating a REST service that accesses the database and gives data to the applications so no application themselves can access a database directly. The API calls on all the methods that access the database and an application chooses, which to use etc. Basically the web applications models arent themselves mapped to any database entities which is commonly done in MVC applications like in ASP.net with entityframework. p  pWhy i thought about this idea in the first place is because i couldnt figure out how to map models to database tables without having to map to all of the tables and their attributes switching some off for some applications, were using Phalcon and have hundreds of unused models in each application. How bad of an idea is creating a REST API for thisp

Negative 57799 pI am trying to solve regression task using recurrent neural network I use pybrain to build it. After my network is fit I want to use it to make predictions. But prediction of recurrent network is affected by its previous prediction whih in turn is affected by prediction before it etc.p  pQuestion is  once network is trained and I want to make predictions with it on a dataset, how to properly kickstart the prediction process. If I will just call .activate on first example from a dataset for predictions that means that the recurrent connection will pass 0 to network and it will affect the subsequent predictions in an undesireable way. Is there a way to force fully trained recurrent network to think that previous activation result was of a some special value If yes, which value is the best here maybe mean of possible activation output values or smth like itp  pUPDATE. Ok, since no one had any ideas within a day on how to do this with recurrent network in pybrain, let me maybe a bit change a formulation to forget about pybrain. Consider that I build a pybrain network for regression for example, predicting price of a stock. Network will be used with a dataset which has 10 features. I add one additional feature into the dataset and fill it with previous price of from a dataset. Thus I replicate a recurrent network aditional input neuron replicates recurrent connection. The questions arep  p1 In the dataset for training I fill this additional feature with previous price. But what to do with the FIRST record in a training dataset I dont know previous price. Should leave it 0 It should a bad idea, previous price WAS NOT zero. Should I use mean of prices in training dataset Any other suggestions 2 Again, same question as 1 but for running fully trained network against test dataset. While running my network against test dataset I should always pick up its prediction and put the result into this new 11th input neuron before making next prediction. But again, what to do when I need to run first prediction in dataset since I dont know previous pricep

Negative 57799 pIm building a Java application. I have this class called Application, which contains arraylists of users objects and groups objects. Inside of the classes User and Group, some methods such as sending a message to another user needs to get another User object searching by email, username, or another field within the arraylist of users in the class Application. Since Application is the container class, I dont want to have instances of it inside the contained classes Users or Groups. p  pAs I just going to have one instance of the Application class, I was thinking to make this class and its attributes static in order to be able to access the searching methods from classes User and Group, but Im also not sure about if its a good idea or a proper use of static classes.

Negative 57799 pIm trying to set up some Django models so that one model can be linked to others of the same name, which I would like to be able to edit in the admin interface . The purpose is so that when records are deprecated those that replace them can retain a link to the original deprecated record.

The thing field, being a link to another model, shows up there and is editable but the replacesdeprecated field does not.

Negative 57799 pIf I have codeifObject.keysobj lt 2code then I have a bug that might slip past my tests if I dont test it with objects with property counts below and atabove 2. i.e. it should have code.lengthcode.p  pIf my linter were to check for type on either side of lt,,lt, then it could warn about this.p  pAlternatively, how else could you catch this I already know that more high quality tests would catch this. The problem with that is you never know when you have enough high quality tests. If a linter or other tool had the ability to warn of types in this situation then this would be automatically caught.p

Negative 57799 pI want to develop an app, which is not a game, that is structured in a way as if it contains levels. As an example, lets say the app defines certain tasks for this week and then next week the tasks are changed. Its good to note that the tasks could hold objects that might be changed like selecting  a certain value for it example, todo tasks gets checked. p  pBefore starting to develop the app, I was thinking of the best way to implement those predefined tasks. Since the tasks will be separated as weekly or daily tasks, first thing came to mind is to create a Plist for each week or just one Plist holding all the weeks. I dont know how much as of performancewise Plist can hold such operations like reading, modifying, etc.  Core data also came to my mind as a solution but it might be harder to prefill a core data database with the values Plists is much easier or I could fill core data from the plist. However, Im still uncertain on which is better in performance.p  pIf any game developer or anyone who encountered such apps can help me on which design pattern is the best for such levelbased app, Ill really appreciate it. It might share some common design pattern with game apps.  p

Then run the test function, which adds the script and add codewith self.scriptcode around the git command and then resumes the function.p  pIs there anyway to do it  is a decorator bad way to implement it  This is not a cosmetic requirement. I need this because in some of my commands there is retry logic, for which I need to provide more than one script to mockproc and run multiple times.p
Negative 57799 pThe issue appears sometimes on several machines in our domain The user starts my .NET 4.0 application, but nothing happens.

Negative 57799 pI have a C Windows Forms app that launches other processes.  When the form closes, I need to shutdown those processes and make emsureem theyre gone so that they dont hang around as zombie processes.  My strategy is that I send the processes a shutdown command over a socket bridge, and wait for them to close gracefully.  After 3 seconds however, if they are still around, I force close them kill them.p  pOriginally I used an strongawait Task.Delay3000strong instruction that lived in the Forms emClosingem event.  However that didnt work.  By the time the strongawait Task.Delay3000strong statement tried to return, the main thread was already gone so the code after that statement that force closes the child processes if theyre still around strongemnever executedemstrong.  To solve the problem I changed strongawait Task.Delay3000strong to a plain strongThread.Sleep3000strong statement.  Now the code following the strongThread.Sleep3000strong executes since the thread is never switched away from as before.p  pHowever, thats 3 seconds where my app appears to be unresponsive.  What technique could I use instead to make sure the code after the 3 second wait definitely executes, without blocking the main UI threadp

The addon loads all the tabs in the series perfectly.  The first script runs smoothly on the first tab. When tested separately, each of the scripts runs the search result like they should.p  h2The problemh2  pWhen everything is finished, not all the tabs display the search results. Several of the search boxes are left blank as if the scripts never ran on those tabs.  The script of the first tab always works, but the scripts on the rest of the tabs have a random chance of not working. I noticed the codeconsole.logStep 4, search  count  is shuttin downcode is never executed. I think this means the worker is never destroyed. That might be causing these issues. The worker for each script should be destroyed after the script runs the following codeself.port.emitmyMessagecode This little segment of code is at the top of every script.

Negative 57799 pI am implementing ANN in python and Im a beginner in both. My problems are  1. The error is very high even with 5000 iterations 2. On denormalizing using the formula op  maxmin  mean , the result is coming out to be outright wrong. They are all centered around one value and there is not enough difference between them to actually be considered as the output.  3. There are times when the outputs vary considerably from 0.00x to 7e5 to 0.999x. Why does this happen 4. To avoid the problem of denormalizing in the end, I tried removing all the sigmoid and desigmoid and tried to use the raw inputs. But it failed as the values became large enough to output NaN very quickly even though my inputs do not exceed 20.p  pMy inputs is a 10x8 matrix and target is 10x1.

Negative 57799 pI know this question is asked so many times but some issue is still not clear to me. strongemPlease dont mark it as duplicateemstrong. I am little bit confused with View. Is View create a table internally or execute sql query internally when I select data from view I know view treated as virtual Table and using view I can also do DML operation. But if View execute sql query internally every time when I select data from View, then what is the requirement of adding extra additional layer. In View I can do complex join query and in stored procedureSP also I can do.p  pSo I mean, in place of View, I can easily use direct SP without doing extra effort by creating View and again SP for that View and calling from c back end.p  pI mean, using View it will be faster or not, I dont know.

Negative 57799 pSay I have a point in a Vector3, and my FPSController Im using the standard one that comes with Unity 5 moves a magnitude of 10 away from this Vector3.  I want to not allow movement, in any direction, beyond magnitude 10.  Ideally, I would anticipate which direction the player pressed to move in, test that vector, and if its below magnitude of 10 then itll allow the movement to proceed.  That way, if youre at 10 and press back, you wont be able to move but if you press forward then no problem.p  pI know Im being a bit abstract here.  From what I understand the FPSController.cs script is using the CharacterController component.  Ive studied the FPSController code for awhile tonight and notice its doing all sorts of calculations on the local position, but the magnitude needs to be between two world coordinates.  p  pI know how to calculate the magnitude already, all I need to know is how to test the anticipated direction.  I have a feeling its easier than I think  p

Negative 57799 pI have a WCF service which exposes two endpoints one TCP and another REST. I have a method in WCF which return a Stream of file. From my client application, I use Async calls to start download the file  and save it as a local file. After the completion of the thread I need to return to the main thread so that I can update the UI. For this I use Dispatcher.Invoke. p  pThe problem is that the rest endpoint seems to download and save the file, but TCP endpoint throws me time out error. Another issue I have is in both endpoints when the code completes and return to line Dispatcher.Invoke it just hangs and does not proceed.p  pI have debugged it and the service call is working on a worker thread as expected but somehow the whole application hangs when I try to use the Dispatcher.Invoke to come back to main threadUI.

I am not expecting huge files though typically between 25 MB. p  pCan you please let me know what I am doing wrong here  I expect the download and write to file complete and then move to main thread.

I animate its size in the codelayoutSubviewscode method of its parent view thuslyp  precode voidlayoutSubviews    [super layoutSubviews]   self.shapeLayer.frame  self.bounds   CGPathRef p  [self bezierPathForOverlay].CGPath   if something irrelevant to this question is true      CABasicAnimation basicAnimation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathpath]     basicAnimation.fromValue  [NSValue valuestart                                  withObjCTypeencodeCGPathRef]     NSValue pW  [NSValue valuep                     withObjCTypeencodeCGPathRef]     basicAnimation.toValue  pW     [self.shapeLayer addAnimationbasicAnimation                            forKeyFKCShapeAnimationPath]      self.shapeLayer.path  p  codepre  pMy understanding is that because I dont set a duration, the duration of the implicit codeCATransactioncode that the system has created will be used, and the shape should change size at the same speed as the cell. Any other properties relating to the timing that I didnt set would be treated similarly.p  pIn practice, however, though the speed is close, it does not seem to be the same, leading to unsightly visual artifacts.p  pIm hoping to avoid a solution that involves in current versions of iOS the durationanimation curve for this animation is this, hard code it  in summary, my question is How can I exactly match animation properties of system animations with Core Animation animationsp
Negative 57799 pI was wondering strongdifference between these two techniques used for creating HTML elementsstrong. I cant find any difference.

Negative 57799 pAs part of account registration I send an email to the new user with a onetime verification link which confirms the existence of their email address and automatically signs them in. However, Ive noticed that the verification script is run when the email is opened  before the link itself is clicked. My assumption is that my email client Outlook.com in this case has some sort of crawler which is following the link in the email when it is opened.p  pAssuming Im correct and if Im not, please correct me, and leaving aside what is potentially a severe breach of privacy as thats offtopic here is there anything I can do to stop this from happeningp  pTo confirm that it is indeed Outlook.com I checked the User Agent, which is codeMozilla5.0 compatible MSIE 10.0 Windows NT 6.2 WOW64 Trident6.0code Im using Chrome on a Mac and the remote address, which is code132.245.26.156code owned by Microsoft.p
