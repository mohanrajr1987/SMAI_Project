This works OK but its a little burdensome usually this also means protecting the constructor and adding a factory method to the class to ensure that all instances are created inside a sharedptr.p  pI just wanted to know how other people had tackled this problem.

Negative 3829 p[UPDATE] Chosen approach is below, as a response to this questionp  pHi, p  pI ve been looking around in this subject but I cant really find what Im looking for...p  pWith Code tables I mean stuff like maritial status, gender, specific legal or social states... More specifically, these types have only set properties and the items are not about to change soon but could. Properties being an Id, a name and a description.p  pIm wondering how to handle these best in the following technologiesp  ul lipin the database multiple tables, one table with different codekeys...pli lipcreating the classes probably something like inheriting ICode with ICode.Name and ICode.Descriptionpli lipcreating the viewpresenter for this there should be a screen containing all of them, so a list of the types gender, maritial status ..., and then a list of values for that type with a name amp description for each item in the valuelist.pli ul  pThese are things that appear in every single project, so there must be some best practice on how to handle these...p  pFor the record, Im not really fond of using enums for these situations... Any arguments on using them here are welcome too.p  p[FOLLOW UP]p  pOk, Ive gotten a nice answer by CodeToGlory and Ahsteele. Lets refine this question.p  pSay were not talking about gender or maritial status, wich values will definately not change, but about stuff that have a Name and a Description, but nothing more. For example Social statuses, Legal statuses.p  pUI I want only one screen for this. Listbox with possibe NameAndDescription Types Ill just call them that, listbox with possible values for the selected NameAndDescription Type, and then a Name and Description field for the selected NameAndDescription Type Item.p  pHow could this be handled in View amp Presenters I find the difficulty here that the NameAndDescription Types would then need to be extracted from the Class Namep  pDB What are procons for multiple vs single lookup tablesp

Im currently working on a monitor app that needs to show the contents of a database in a datagrid Im using the a hrefhttpwindowsclient.netwpfwpf35wpf35sp1toolkitdatagridfeaturewalkthrough.aspx relnofollowWPFToolkita grid btw. The grid binds to a table in my ADO.NET DataSet and it works fine. If I modify the DataSet through a button in my UI the grid updates and everyone is happy binding and ADO.NET is nicely described in a hrefhttpbea.stollnitz.comblogp21 relnofollowthis bloga. However, the database will be updates by other applications and the monitor app needs to display those changes automatically. The DataSet is updated through polling the database for various reasons listening to postevents from the DB is not applicable but the changes are not displayed in the grid.p  pAs far as I have understood this is a feature of WPF databinding. You cannot update the source from another thread than the UIs. In my mind this is insane. There must be thousands of apps out there where data is entered from another user or application.

The Date that changed and a project name to checkdates.php using GET and adding the data to the URL string.  This Ajax call loaded the page in a div with the ID status  and php page displayed what the outcome of the date check was.    p  pThe Old code used prototype to pull in the data as a function and I used the onChange event on the form elementsp  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srcprototype.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function checkDatedate,project     ifdate     new Ajax.Updaterstatus, datechecker.phpdatedateampprojectproject,  method get       else      alertenter a valid date           ltscriptgt codepre  pThe code Im trying to move over to jquery now looks likep    precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction      inputdateto.changefunction      var datevalue  this.val     status.loaddatechecker.phpdatedatevalueampprojectlt echo COOKIE[department] gt                inputdatefrom.changefunction      var datevalue  this.val     status.loaddatechecker.phpdatedatevalueampprojectlt echo COOKIE[department] gt                    ltscriptgt codepre  pI think it may be an issue probably with how im pulling in my data or how im asking it to check the .change feature because its not firing.   Any assistance would be wonderful.

Negative 3829 pI have a PHP application that calls web services APIs to get some objects before rendering a web page that incorporates those objects. In some cases these APIs are really slow seconds and that is not acceptable from a user experience point of view. Two things I know I can do...p  ol liUse ajax and make these calls in the backgroundli liTime out the call and degrade gracefully if it is taking too longli ol  pNeither is ideal, so I was thinking about using memcache the PHP extension for memcached to cache the object that I get from the 3rd party web service. The objects will be loaded many times by different users loading the same page, so this seems to make sense. p  pThe objects are relatively small 1k.p  pDoes this sound like a reasonable approach I know memcached was originally designed to alleviate database load, so Im wondering whether there is a gotcha somewhere that Im not seeing.p  pThanks.p

Negative 3829 pWhen writing my own flat file databases I try and keep the file sizes as small as possible, when designing mySQL databases I put all my tables into one database Im under the belief that mySQL stores each table in its own file. Im new to sqlite and my ethics clash  a whole database stored in one file.p  pI know the recommended size is about 2GB per database for sqlite, and I dont expect to reach that size, but is there any upside to splitting the database For example splitting a database into two, one with various settings tables numerous tables, low number of rows, the other with various content tables few tables, many rows in each.p  pI have a good understanding of filesystems, and know I shouldnt bother this much about it, but there is a gut feeling I just cannot shake of wanting to separate the database.

Negative 3829 pIm an 18 years old trainee and Im discovering scala which I like very much . To get familiar with the scala actors I wrote a small simulation with some gears and one controller. The ActorApplication creates N gears with random speed. The controller calculates a synchronization speed and starts the gearactors. The gears synchronize to this given speed step by step 1 or 1. The simulation is finished when all gears have reached the synchronization speed. I developed the simulation in scala 2.7.7  and it worked as I expected it see output below. However, when I swichted to the current 2.8.0SNAPSHOT I discovered strange behavior.  This is the codep  precode   Created by IntelliJ IDEA.

Negative 3829 pIn general, if you have a class that inherits from a codeThreadcode class, and you want instances of that class to automatically deallocate after they are finished running, is it okay to codedelete thiscodep  pSpecific Examplep  pIn my application I have a codeTimercode class with one codestaticcode method called codeschedulecode. Users call it like sop  precodeTimerschedulevoidobj, ampcallbackFunction, 15  call callbackFunctionobj in 15 seconds codepre  pThe codeschedulecode method creates a codeTaskcode object which is similar in purpose to a Java TimerTask object. The codeTaskcode class is codeprivatecode to the codeTimercode class and inherits from the codeThreadcode class which is implemented with pthreads. So the codeschedulecode method does thisp  precodeTask task  new Taskobj, callback, seconds taskgtstart  fork a thread, and call the tasks run method codepre  pThe codeTaskcode constructor saves the arguments for use in the new thread. In the new thread, the tasks coderuncode method is called, which looks like thisp  precodevoid TimerTaskrun      Threadsleepthisgtseconds     thisgtcallbackthisgtobj     delete this  codepre  pNote that I cant make the codetaskcode object a stack allocated object because the new thread needs it. Also, Ive made the codeTaskcode class codeprivatecode to the codeTimercode class to prevent others from using it.p  pI am particularly worried because deleting the codeTaskcode object means deleting the underlying codeThreadcode object. The only state in the codeThreadcode object is a codepthreadtcode variable. Is there any way this could come back to bite me Keep in mind that I do not use the codepthreadtcode variable after the coderuncode method finishes.p  pI could bypass calling codedelete thiscode by introducing some sort of state either through an argument to the codeThreadstartcode method or something in the codeThreadcode constructor signifying that the method that is forked to should codedeletecode the object that it is calling the coderuncode method on. However, the code seems to work as is.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 3829 pI noticed that the Grails hibernate plugin does not support the hibernate load function  Does anybody know why that is  In all of the documentation that I have seen, it seems that the accepted way to delete an object from a db is to do a get with the object id followed by a delete.

Negative 3829 pI should start by saying Im not now, nor do I have any delusions Ill ever be a professional programmer so most of my skills have been learned from experience very much as a hobby. p  pI learned PHP as it seemed a good simple introduction in certain areas and it allowed me to design simple web applications. p  pWhen I learned about objects, classes etc the tutors basic examnples covered the idea that as a rule of thumb each database table should have its own class. While that worked well for the photo gallery project we wrote, as it had very simple mysql queries, its not working so well now my projects are getting more complex. If I require data from two separate tables which require a table join Ive instead been ignoring the class altogether and handling it on a case by case basis, OR, even worse been combining some of the data into the class and the rest as a separate entity and doing two queries, which to me seems inefficient. p  pAs an example, when viewing content on a forum I wrote, if you view a thread, I retrieve data from the threads table, the posts table and the user table. The queries from the user and posts table are retrieved via a join and not instantiated as an object, whereas the thread data is called using my Threads class.p  pSo how do I get from my current state of affairs to something a little less stupid, for want of a better word. Right now I have a DB class that deals with connection and escaping values etc, a parent db query class that deals with the common queries and methods, and all of the other classes Thread, Upload, Session, Photo and ones thats arent used Post, User etc  are children of that. p  pDo I make a big posts class that has the relevant extra attributes that I retrieve from the users and potentially threads tablebr Do I have separate classes that populate each of their relevant attributes with a single query If so how do I do thatbr Because of the way my classes are written, based on what I was taught,  my db update row method, or insert method both just take the attributes as an array and update all of that, if I have extra attributes from other db tables in each class then how do I rewrite those methods as obbiously updating automatically like that would result in errors  p  pIn short I think my understanding is limited right now and Id like some pointers when it comes to the fundamentals of how to write more complex classes.p  pEdit  p  pThanks for the answers so far theyve given me lots of pointers and thoughts and a lot of reading material. What I would like though is maybe an idea of how different people have decided to handle a simple table join with any amount of classes Did you add attributes to the classes Query from outside the class then pass the results into each class Something else p

Negative 3829 pIm reading the book Clean Code and am struggling with a concept.

If I do need to access properties, they should be on a Data Structure, which could be returned from a method on my object  With this approach, it seems that I would need a GetHeight and SetHeight method for my Height property on my object, rather than just using emgetem and emsetem of the property.p  pMaybe Im not understanding exactly what is being suggested, but this is my understanding of emObjects hide their dataem.  If you could help me understand this, Id greatly appreciate itp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 3829 pI have a SQL Server database and Entity Framework Model setup with POCO objects, this is working fine. However, I have also created a Sqlite database from the SQL Server database using a simple conversion process. p  pSo I have created another EDMX file for the SQLite database, which I would like to use my existing POCOs generated from the SQL Server model and map them to the database. Unfortunately this maps the SQLite primary key integer columns as int64 this seems to be the underlying integer type in SQLite, when they are simply ints in the SQL Server database. p  pThis means when I try to map the new SQLite EDMX to my existing POCO objects generated from the SQL Server EDMX by the POCO T4 Template, the objects cannot be mapped at runtime and throw exceptions because the id columns differ in type.p  pDoes anyone know of a fix for this, for example is there a way to convert values in the entity framework edmx file If there isnt I would consider this a fairly major limitation of the entity framework.p  pThanks for any assistance.p

Negative 3829 pWith the current developments regarding Oracle announcing its intention to charge for a pro or whatever you call it version of JVM, and IBM announcing its intention to support OpenJDK, things are getting quite complicated for a large set of Java developers.  We have a large piece of work in Java, and we did not have any issues in choosing our licensing terms up until now. It appears that well have to switch to OpenJDK where IBM will be putting their support. But OpenJDK is GPL V2, and as far as I know, any code linking to GPL V2 must be GPL V2.  We also have some JNI code, which is going to get even larger. Given these facts, does it mean that if we use OpenJDK to run our software, well have to switch to GPL for our licensing Needless to say, this would blow away our whole licensing amp business model setup. p

But how do I go about the transition from SQL Server to MySQL How does this influence my queries inside my code is it the same code syntax Will I have to recreate the table definitions In my project I used LINQ to SQL. p  pAm I forced to look for a host with SQL Server capabilities i.e. licenses I hope not...p  pThanksp

Negative 3829 pDoes there exist an algorithm which, given an ordered list of symbols a1, a2, a3, ..., ak, produces in On time a new list of the same symbols in a random order without bias Without bias means the probability that any symbol emsem will end up in some position empem in the list is 1k.p  pAssume it is possible to generate a nonbiased integer from 1k inclusive in O1 time.

Then when they press the Register button, it fades in the others.p  pHowever, when you press submit that doesnt work  because the wrong form handler is managing it.p  pThis is what my regular registration form looks like which works, btw at codedeviseregistrationsnew.html.erbcodep  precodelth2gtSign uplth2gt  lt formforresource, as gt resourcename, url gt registrationpathresourcename do f gt   lt deviseerrormessages gt    ltpgtlt f.label username gtltbr gt   lt f.textfield username gtltpgt    ltpgtlt f.label email gtltbr gt   lt f.textfield email gtltpgt    ltpgtlt f.label password gtltbr gt   lt f.passwordfield password gtltpgt    ltpgtlt f.label passwordconfirmation gtltbr gt   lt f.passwordfield passwordconfirmation gtltpgt    ltpgtlt f.submit Sign up gtltpgt lt end gt  lt render partial gt devisesharedlinks gt codepre  pThe applicable part of my routes file looks like thisp  precodedevisefor users, pathnames gt  signup gt register,                                    signin gt login,                                    signout gt logout   devisescope user do     get login, to gt devisesessionsnew     get register, to gt deviseregistrationsnew     get logout,   to gt devisesessionsdestroy codepre  pSo the behavior I want is as followsp  pThe user goes to login, they see only two form fields username  password. They press enter it logs them in.p  pIf they press Register, without doing a pageload, I would like the right form with the additional form fields required first name, last name, etc. to appear and when they press enter it does the registration. I would also like the URL to change from codemyapp.comlogincode to codemyapp.comregistercode  without a page load. If they pressed Sign In without filling out the form, it should take them back to the login page codemyapp.comlogincode with only the two fields username  pass showing.p  pThat way when I link directly to codemyapp.comregistercode it goes directly to that one page with the correct form fields and it functions properly.p  pBasically functionality similar to the way github now manages browsing through a repo with no page refreshes but the URL changes.p  pSuggestionsp

Is there a way i can modify this line as the user types it or is there any other way to achieve this So that the file only fetches the row data for that route and not the entire database as the database about 50,000 entries.p  pAny links to examples or tutorials are appreciated.p
Negative 3829 pIn reference to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq52009231586this questiona about read and write, Im wondering if each open file description has its own read and write buffers or if perhaps theres a single read and write buffer for a file when it has been opened multiple times at once. Im curious because this would have an effect on what exactly happens with overlapping writes to the same file. Perhaps this is something that varies among Unixesp  pTo my understanding, file description refers to the infooptions about an open file, such as the current marker position. File descriptor, in contrast, refers to just the number used in a process to refer to a description.p

Negative 3829 pI am looking for a fast binary serialization framework to use in Windows Phone 7 for a project I am migrating from Windows Mobile 6.5 Protobufnet works great in WM6.5, but it is still far from prime time in WP7, so I was wondering if anyone knows of a good alternative in the mean time.p  pI need a framework that supports serializing a wide range of types custom types, arrays of custom types, collections of custom types, builtin types, serializable types in the framework,etc.p  pI have found a couple, but they are not that much faster than DataContractSerialization but definitely more compact.

Negative 3829 pWhats happening is im performing a read of some records, say Car where color  red, and it returns 10 cars. Then I iterate over those 10 cars, and update a date in that car object, i.e. car.setDate512010. Then I perform another read from Cars where color  green. I have sql logging turned on and I noticed when i call query.list it actually prints out some update statements to the Cars table, and I end up getting a lock wait timeout. Also note, this is all done in a single database transaction, so I can understand the lock wait timeout  it seems like i have a lock on the table im reading from, and in that same transaction im trying to update it before i release the lock on the table. But it seems like it shouldnt be trying to run the sql to update those records until the end of the transaction when i call commit This is all using hibernates HQL to perform the reads. Im not calling anything directly at all to do the saves, im just doing car.setDate. p

Negative 3829 pIm currently developing a web app where I make use of digital signing of forms using the portuguese citizen card and java applets.p  pEverything have been going smoothly with the regular forms until I reached a problem with inputs of type file. The app supports attachments so I created a separated attachment manager where the user can submit or review the attachments. When submitting it is necessary to be there two ways of doing it normal upload or sign the file and then upload.p  pMy first idea was to let the user select the file in the input typefile and if heshe clicked on sign and upload it would launch a java applet to generate the signature to be putted in a hidden input. The problem lies in the security restrictions of html that makes the file chosen value inaccessible from javascript which also denies access to the java applet in some browsers.p  pI also thought of calculating the hash of the file to be signed on server side and then sign it on client side but that also isnt an option. The determination of the hash and its signature must all be on client side legal reasons.p  pAnother idea was to use something like JUpload but it doesnt support some cases were the connection is over a SSL channel with client certificate which can happen depending on how the login was made on the web app.p  pLastly I even had this absurd idea of open the file on the applet, sign it and then store it on a hidden input in base64. Obviously this creates a huge constrain on file size.p  pSo my question is What is the best approach to this problem Any suggestionsp  pThanks in advance p

Yet in real scenarios stack size can be smaller like 256 kilobytes and there could be more branches with smaller objects that would induce a total allocation size enough to overflow the stack.p  pThat makes no sense. The worst case would be 700 kilobytes  it would be the codepath that constructs the set of local variables with the largest total size along the way. Detecting that path during compilation should not be a problem.p  pSo the compiler produces a program that tries to allocate even more memory than the worst case. According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7089035atwhatmomentismemorytypicallyallocatedforlocalvariablesinc70895597089559this answera LLVM does the same.p  pThat could be a deficiency in the compiler or there could be some real reason for doing it this way. I mean maybe I just dont understand something in compilers design that would explain why doing allocation this way is necessary.p  pWhy would the compiler want a program allocate more memory than the code needs in the worst casep

Negative 3829 pstrongHeres the storystrong Ive created an application that starts at boot time and perform some action at specified interval. To achieve that Im creating a service that uses an codeAlarmManagercode to create repeating event which is then handled by codeBroadcastReceivercode which does the heavy work. When the service is destroyed user choose to exit the application the event has to be cancelled, so the service has to keep reference to the same codePendingIntentcode that was used to start it.p  pstrongThe problemstrong Service has to call codestartForegroundcode to ensure it doesnt die so it can maintain the reference to codePendingIntentcode.

I have similar code in my Edit View and the state is populated correctly in that View that is, the state associated with an existing Provider.Location shows selected in the DropDownList for the user to edit if desire, but in both the Create and the Edit Views the selection made by the user is never registered in my Model specifically the Provider.Location.StateId coming in from the POST.p  pLooking at the HTML produced I see thisp  precodeltdiv classeditorlabelgt     ltlabel forLocationStateIdgtStateTerritoryltlabelgt ltdivgt ltdiv classeditorfieldgt     ltselect idStateId nameStateIdgtltoption valuegt[Choose]ltoptiongt         ltoption value1gtAlabamaltoptiongt         ltoption value2gtAlaskaltoptiongt         lt more options ... gt     ltselectgt     ltspan classfieldvalidationvalid datavalmsgforLocation.StateId datavalmsgreplacetruegtltspangt ltdivgt codepre  pI suspect I need to somehow convey the Location.StateId relationship instead of just StateId as I see above but I cant figure out the correct syntax to do that.

Negative 3829 pI have been trying to get a Berkeley DB up and running for a C project I have. I downloaded and built the .NET version from Oracle. For the most part, it is working the way I would expect and performing like a champ. But the one issue Im having trouble with has to do with duplicate keys. p  pFirst, every time I try to use the .putNoDuplicate method it throws an error even though the key is not a dupe.p  precodedb.PutNoDuplicatek, v codepre  pThe output on the console says Illegal flag specified to DBput, and an exception is raised with error code 22. The exception itself contains no info.p  pSo I figured, OK, maybe this method is buggy, Ill just do the check myself. I changed the code to p  precodeif db.Existsk     throw new System.Data.DataExceptionDuplicate key else     db.Putk, v codepre  pThis works, but is emextremelyem slow. For reference, it adds roughly 10,000 records almost instantaneously when only db.Put is called, but slows to roughly 40 records per second when doing the above db.Exists check. That just cant be right. p  pCan anyone offer any insight on what is going on Thanksp  pEDIT So Ive figured out part of it. The slowness on the db.Exists check was happening because the BerkeleyDB code routinely throws, and internally handles, an exception when the function returns false. When I run the release build of the code, the speed is back up where I would expect it. But I would still love to know why the putNoDuplicate call is failing in the first place. p

Negative 3829 pSuppose I need to call a free GlobalInitializer before my constructor initializes any member variables.  For examplep  precodeclass Foo    public     Foo  bar             calling GlobalInitializer here is too late        Bar bar  codepre  pCalling GlobalInitializer in Foo is too late because I need to call it before bar is initialized.

Is there a cleaner design pattern or refactoring which will achieve the same resultp  pstrongAdditional Notestrong  GlobalInitializer is an expensive call that I want to avoid unless the user instantiates a Foo.  There are guards inside GlobalInitializer against multiple calls.  Also, there may be other classes, say FooBar, that also need to call GlobalInitializer, but in one process, GlobalInitializer will actually do work once if Foo or FooBar is instantiated or not even once if there are no instantiations of Foo or FooBar.p

Negative 3829 pI am working on a web application that will be going live soon, and I am now trying to figure out the best way for handling sending email from the application.  I understand completely HOW to send email from the application using the MailMessage and SmtpClient classes, however my question is from a different angle.  My main purpose at my job before this project was support of old applications that had been developed before my time.  In these applications, when they needed to send email, they hard coded any of the messages into the actual message with all of the HTML tags embeded directly into the C code.p  pThe application that I am working on will have a template for the emails to be sent in, as a sort of styling container, and the different messages will be embeded into the main content divs of the template.  I would like to avoid hardcoding these templates in this application, so I have been trying to figure out the best way to layout my project.  I have thought of using a t4 template, and reading the different t4s into the application and applying a String.Format with the specified parameters to add namesemails to the messages to be sent.  However, I am not sure this is the best way to do it.p  pMy other idea was to define a class for each type of message, however this would end up hardcoding messages again, which as I said I dont want to do.p  pMy question is, how have you approached this in the past  What worked, and what didnt and for what reasons  I have looked all over online, but either the only content out there is on HOW to send the message, or I have not used the right Google power words.p

Negative 3829 pIm working on an ASP.NET project that contains a few hundreds of ASPXASCX files, which seem to keep calling each other. And its a complete mess and its not clear which page is called from which other page.br And to make it even more complex, this is all used to just generate a single webpage thats printed to PDF te generate a report of 20 to 60 pages. So, hundreds of files for one webpage. And I like the concept but now I need to make small adjustments to fix some bugs.br Another complex problem is the fact that these pages dont contain any real text. The report is multilingual so each and every line of text is languagedependant and read from a large database containing all texts for each of the 8 languages we support. So, a quicksearch for a specific text wont work.br And of course, all documentation could be printed on a piece of paper the size of a stamp. So, no one knows how and where each and every control or page is used.  p  pWell, I want to start creating this documentation first, if it can be done fast and simple. So Im looking for a tool which can analyse all this code and generate something more humanreadable than hundreds of files. A simple Worddocument or PDF file would be nice.br Does such a tool exist Is it freep

Negative 3829 pI had a different problem first, so I made this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9794765javajpanelmouselistenerdoesntworkoveritscomponentsJava JPanel mouse listener doesn39t work over its componentsap  pThe answers led me to arrive at a java GlassPane. I saw the other posts on SO about this and they all point to this article a hrefhttpweblogs.java.netblogalexfromsunarchive200609awellbehavedg.html relnofollowhttpweblogs.java.netblogalexfromsunarchive200609awellbehavedg.htmla.p  pI used the example from the article FinalGlassPane.java and set it up exactly as in the test appp  precodeGlassPane glass  new GlassPanethis getRootPane.setGlassPaneglass GestureListener gl  new GestureListener glass.addMouseMotionListenergl glass.addMouseListenergl glass.setVisibletrue if glass instanceof AWTEventListener      AWTEventListener al  AWTEventListener glass     Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit.addAWTEventListeneral,             AWTEvent.MOUSEMOTIONEVENTMASK  AWTEvent.MOUSEEVENTMASK  codepre  pBut I still have the same problem, the glass prevents me from being able to click any buttons JButton below it.p  pIf youve been kind enough to read my initial SO question and think glassPane is not for me, please post me an alternative solution, otherwise please tell me why this isnt working.p  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongEDIT IT WORKS but stops working when I add my own MouseListenerstrongp  pNotice in my code I was adding my own codeGestureListenercode, I cant add my own MouseListener to this implementation  thats what makes it not work. I took those lines off and the glass pane is now working correctly.p  pThere is this notice in the code FinalGlassPane.java regarding MouseListener which I dont really understand, so my new question is how can I add my own MouseListener to this glass panep  precode   If someone adds a mouseListener to the GlassPane or set a new cursor   we expect that he knows what he is doing   and return the super.containsx, y   otherwise we return false to respect the cursors   for the underneath components   Override public boolean containsint x, int y      if getMouseListeners.length  0 ampamp getMouseMotionListeners.length  0             ampamp getMouseWheelListeners.length  0             ampamp getCursor  Cursor.getPredefinedCursorCursor.DEFAULTCURSOR          return false          return super.containsx, y  codepre  pstrongADDITIONAL INFOstrongp  pIf I always return false in the codecontainsint, intcode method the buttons always work, but my MouseListener on the GlassPane doesnt. If I always return super.containsx,y then the opposite happens MouseListener on the GlassPane works but I cant click any components underneath.p  pstrongFINAL EDITstrong So I came to the conclusion that I cant or dont have a way with Java 6 to allow my Application to have 2 layers which can receive MouseListener events mousePressed, mouseReleased at the same time. In the end I used the solution on my original question, which was to create a custom JButton and have that add the MouseListener to each instance.p

Negative 3829 pI know I have to be doing something wrong, but again I dont fully understand what Im doing as it is.  Im creating a form which will have multiple buttons linked to JavaScript functions to do stuff. Im at the very basic point of having these two buttons on the same page, and when you onMouseOver, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseOut it changes the image of my button.p  pI know there are other ways to do this better ways but Im trudging on in this direction to at least get a better understanding of how JavaScript works. I know Ill have somewhat more complicated things to do down the road that may require something like this and I want to be sure I understand it when I get there.p  pThe problem Im having is that the second button does not do anything when you try to use it. The first button works fine, but the second button doesnt And when you try to use the second button, it makes the first one go off. So if I onMouseOver button 2, button 1 will show the affect. I tried copying my image files into a new set so they arent using the same images, but that just showed me what when I use button 2, the functions set up for button 2 are being applied to button 1.p  pAnyway, heres the HTML code....p  precodeltinput typehidden  value0 idtheValue  gt  ltpgtlta  hrefjavascriptaddElement  gtltimg idbutton onMouseOverhoverover onMouseOuthoveroff  onMouseDownclickadd onMouseUprelease    srcimagesadddefault.png nameadd width43 height21gtltagtltpgt   ltinput typehidden  value0 idtheValue2  gt  ltpgtlta hrefjavascriptaddProduct  gtltimg idbutton2   onMouseOverhoveroversecond onMouseOuthoveroffsecond  onMouseDownclickaddsecond onMouseUpreleasesecond   srcimagesadddefault2.png nameadd2 width43 height21gtltagtltpgt codepre  pAnd here is the JavaScript....p  precode Button Animation 1   function hoveroff  document.images.add.srcimagesadddefault.png      function hoverover  document.images.add.srcimagesaddhover.png   function clickadd  document.images.add.srcimagesaddclick.png   function release  document.images.add.srcimagesaddhover.png       Button Animation 2  function hoveroffsecond  document.images.add.srcimagesadddefault2.png   function hoveroversecond  document.images.add.srcimagesaddhover2.png  function clickaddsecond  document.images.add.srcimagesaddclick2.png  function releasesecond  document.images.add.srcimagesaddhover2.png     codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong here How do I get these links to actually work separately from each otherp  pPlease teach me wise ones.

Negative 3829 pHey guys Im creating a Facebook Application as my summer project and am very interested in making it accessible on mobile devices.

Negative 3829 pOS Xs a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationUserExperienceReferenceSearchKitReferencereference.html relnofollowSearch Kit Frameworka allows to create and access search indexes. However, it is not possible to access an existing search index when the name of that index is unknown. All functions of the framework which may be used to access an existing search index SKIndexOpenWithData, SKIndexOpenWithMutableData, SKIndexOpenWithURL ask for the index name. This is not the same as the file name of the file in which the search index data is stored. p  pWhen I try to access an existing search index file by calling SKIndexOpenWithURL without knowing the name of the index, the function doesnt return a valid SKIndexRef. Passing NULL as index name as suggested by the frameworks documentation doesnt work because then the Search Kit Framework only tries to use an index name of IADefaultIndex. p  pAs an example, if I create an index file with an index name like thisp  precode    NSString path  UsersTimDesktopsearchindex.skindex     NSURL url  [NSURL fileURLWithPath path]       NSString name  myIndex               SKIndexType type  kSKIndexInverted                         SKIndexRef skIndex     skIndex  SKIndexCreateWithURL bridge CFURLRefurl, bridge CFStringRefname, SKIndexTypetype, CFDictionaryRefNULL      .. codepre  pI can later only open the file and access the stored index if I know the index name myIndex. If I try to open the file without having or knowing the index name, the following code sample will failp  precode    NSURL skURL  [NSURL fileURLWithPathUsersTimDesktopsearchindex.skindex]     SKIndexRef skIndex     skIndex  SKIndexOpenWithURLbridge CFURLRefskURL, NULL, true     if skIndex NSLog couldnt open index codepre  pHowever, the name of the search index is surely inside that index file. Does anybody know of a way to retrieve that name or to otherwise access a search index file without knowing the search index name Im aware that according to the framework documentation there is no possibility of using the framework to get that index name, but it should nevertheless be possible.p

It bothers me greatly that I have codescriptcode and codemyMaincode emandem codemaincode.  It also bothers me that I have to execute coderunStatecode within codemyMaincode and that I have to feed an initial state into coderunStateTcode in my main function.  Im wanting to have my script, so to speak, directly in the myMain function because the entire point of myMain is to be able to run the append and sum directly in myMain and right next to the print operations.

In a sense, they also had to be lifted into the StateT monad, though the correct way of thinking of in is that they had to be emrunem in the monad hence, coderunState script newcode.p  pIm not sure I completely get it, but I will work with it for a while, read the MonadState code, and write something about this when it finally works in my head.p

Negative 3829 pIve been after a specific navigation pattern. First Ill explain how Id like it to behavep  pIf you imagine a web page with a large header or nav bar. When the page is scrolled down everything lower down on the page scrolls up whilst the header stays static underneath.p  pA very close example of this is here a hrefhttpinspectelement.comdemosresponsivemobilenav relnofollowhttpinspectelement.comdemosresponsivemobilenavap  pIn fact I tried contacting the author to no avail. p  pIf you imagine that example but when scrolled up the grey bar then fixes to the top of the screen On scroll up the grey bar needs to detach again and start scrolling. p  pIve seen this work in many places and Ive even built my own. The big issue is that all examples Ive seen dont update immediately on iOS. The example above does and I think uses jquery animate, but I have the issue of detaching the grey bar without it jumping in ios. p  pIf anyone can help I would be very grateful. p  pMikep

Negative 3829 pMy universitys wireless login page is slow because it has a blocking js file that sometimes errors out. Typically you have to wait two timeout periods because they separate the username entry and password entry.p  pI was wondering if there was an easy way to force chrome to cache an empty file. I think I can do it by temporarily redirecting that domain to my local machine, requesting the same file and sending caching headers. I really want to know if it can be done via javascript ... possibly a bookmarklet. Itd be nice to be able to distribute this to other students.p  pFor the record, I did inform them of the problem and that they could simply push the file down but got a canned response that they had no solution.p
Negative 3829 pI need to populate my map with annotations. Each annotation has corresponding Place resource that is being fetched from remote server. Each Place has associated Category  it is fetched from the server too as a separate resource.p  pLets assume that to populate a given region I need to fetch 100 places, each belonging to the one of 20 categories actually there are much more of them. p  pI use AFNetworking to fetch the both of resources. I try to cache both places and categories for offline use, so before the annotations are displayed on map, I write fetched resources to the Core Data tables.p  pEach place retrieves its associated category resource by demand and I need to write both a place in the places table, and category in the categories table. p  pBecause of fetching is being done asynchronously, when writing particular category to table I cant know if maybe another place thread attempts to write the same associated category to categories table.p  pSo, the question is what is the pattern for working with Core Data tables, when they need to be populated with information retrieved asynchronously Specifically how any given thread which is going to write a category could know that there is already one trying to do thatp  pUPDATE 1 My current problem is that currently I am having the duplication of categories. My guess is that obviously each category which attempts to be written is not aware about the parallel write of the same category.p  pUPDATE 2 The most simple description of my case is the followingp  pI create a new Category entity with some fields in one thread and in the meantime in another thread I create exactly the same Category entity with the same fields aiming to be the same Category object like the first thread has.p  pOne thread wins calling em[managedObjectContext saveamperror]em, but then before the actual record is appeared in the PersistentStore, the second does call the save too. The question is how to prevent the duplication of records in categories tablep  pUPDATE 3 I am considering both variants of using managed object contexts 1 reusing one shared moc instance by all threads 2 instantiate a new moc on each threadp  pThanks p

Negative 3829 pI have a JButton, in a JPanel, in a JApplet, that when clicked, does some stuff, changes the contents of the JPanel, then should repaint. However, it doesnt seem like its repainting anything more than the button its self and the JPanel is repainting its self too. However, I think I need to have the JApplet repaint itsself. Essentially, Ill click one of the buttons, the buttons will change, but the JLabels wont show up. Once I rezise the applet, or in the browser make it so small that the sides of the browser touch the applet, it all resets and looks great  One of the buttons code is as followsp  precodereset.addActionListenernew ActionListener              public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                              resets the vars             questions  0             wrong  0             correct  0             clears the JPanel             overallJP.removeAll             adds new question, and buttons             rand  generator.nextInt10             JLabel tmp  new JLabelAnswer the Question nqArr.getrand.getQuestion             overallJP.setSizenew Dimension500,700             overallJP.addtmp             overallJP.addbuttonArea             overallJP.repaint             setVisibletrue             repaint                       codepre  pAnd the other buttons look similar. I think the problem is on the repaint at the bottom. Is there a way to call the JApplets repaint from inside this anonymous function The reset button is declared in the init of the applet.

Negative 3829 pMy current setup has one large monitor and one smaller monitor.  I have VS 2010 expanded to fill both monitors, and I have two horizontal Tab Groups set up on the larger and one on the smaller.  Problem is, every time I run the program, VS automatically repositions the dividers so that theyre evenly spaced across the combined monitor space, causing the middle panel to be split down the middle.  I then have to move the dividers back where I want them  one right between the screens and one halfway across the larger screen.  Then when I stop the program, it resets them AGAIN, and I have to constantly repeat this process, which is not only really annoying, but also slow and unresponsive when dealing with the very large codebase Im currently working on.  Is there some way to tell VS to just leave my window positioning alone between running and stopping executionp

Negative 3829 pI have a library written with C that uses standard streams to read and write objects. I also have a Python interface generated with Swig that Im using to access the library.

Negative 3829 pI am developing .NET WEB Api REST Service using framework 4.5 and the architectural direction now is to separate functional areas of our API. In other words, placing controllers into separate assemblies, e.g. having controllers in assemblies like company.web.administration, company.web.claims, etc.p  pAfter experimenting with it, I noticed the power of the MVC framework. I can place controllers into separate class libraries but as long as these libraries are in the bin folder, they strongdont even have to be referencedstrong. MVC finds them in the assemblies and API calls work fine.p  pBut under this architecture, the problem arises that we might get large number of these controller libraries.

As part of the interface, I need to display a marker on a map of a known, smallish area based on a latitude and longitude that update behind the scenes every so often.

For example, an UserManager and a PhoneManager.p  pBecause Im having quite a few problems with making all those Managers static, I was wondering if I could solve it with a ManagerManager.p  pThat ManagerManager would be static, and on creation, it would instantiate all the other Managers.

But, with the advantages of the class not being static.p  pDoes this work Suggestions to improve are welcome as well. p

Negative 3829 pI wonder why the following generic definition does not produce a compiler warningp  precodeclass MyClassltT extends Listgt   codepre  pand how the above definition is different top  precodeclass MyClassltT extends Listltgtgt   codepre  pWhenever you read about generics, you read about how raw types should be avoided and consequently, whenever you handle generic types, you get a compiler warning. The raw type inside of the first definition does however not create such a warning.p  pSecondly, I wonder how the exact subtyping definition between raw types and generic types are. According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2770321whatisarawtypeandwhyshouldntweuseitthis summarya, raw types are kind of an optout of type checking such that type checking is simply inactive whenever a raw type is involved. Is this assumption correct And how does this effect the above raw generic definitionsp  pThank you for your helpp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I understand what you are saying. However, this is not what I am confused about.

The second is however allowed. How can I perform the first call without inner raw types I dont see why the compiler would forbid the first. Shoulnt any parameter valid wildcard parameter imply code extends MyClassltgtcodep  pstrongUPDATE 2strong I found out by trial and error, that I can solve the problem by definingp  precodepublic ltT extends MyClasslt extends Tgt void callBound2T node       Do something  codepre  peven though I do not quite understand why. But there is even more confusion, when looking at this example this is a very simple version of what I am actually trying to do.p  precodepublic void call      genericCall1new MyFilterltMyClassltgtgt, MyClass.class     genericCall2new MyFilterltMyClassltgtgt, MyClass.class   public ltT extends MyClasslt extends Tgtgt void genericCall1MyFilterltTgt filter, Classlt extends Tgt filterBoundary     Do something.   public ltT extends MyClasslt extends Tgt, U extends Tgt void genericCall2MyFilterltTgt filter, Classlt extends Ugt filterBoundary     Do something.   class MyClassltT extends MyClassltTgtgt    class MyFilterltT extends MyClasslt extends Tgtgt   codepre  pWhy is codegenericCall1code prohibited and codegenericCall2code is not Again, I found the solution by an academic guess instead of true understanding.

Negative 3829 pIn a previous questionanswer I learnt how databinding in Windows Phone does TypeConversion for codestringcode to codeImageSourcecode using the codeTypeConverterAttributecode  see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma16753488373321httpstackoverflow.coma16753488373321ap  pIm now looking at the same problem in WindowsStore apps where codeTypeConverterAttributecode a hrefhttpanswers.flyppdevportal.comcategoriesmetrocsharpvb.aspxIDf8a0af25714143398889b791166f450edoesnt exista.p  pIf I use WinRT databinding then clearly the databinding layer still manages to do the correct conversion. The a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappswindows.ui.xaml.controls.image.sourceMSDN documentationa saysp  blockquote   pthis behavior relies on underlying type conversion that processes the string as a URI, and calls the equivalent of the BitmapImageUri constructor. p blockquote  pHowever, I cant see any metadata anywhere about how it knows what conversion to do.p  pIm trying to build my own databinding implementation  so being able to mimic what WinRT does would be very useful.p  pIs there a queryable metadata hint somewhere which tells the Xaml databinding what conversion to apply Or is this codestringcode to codeImageSourcecode conversion somehow baked into the runtime, hidden from the CLR layer p  pIf it is hidden, is there a list anywhere of known automatic type conversions so that I could cache them in my databinding implementationp

Negative 3829 pIve been a good JavaScript programmer and adhered to the a hrefhttpjavascript.crockford.comcode.htmlcoding conventionsa enlisted by a hrefhttpcrockford.comDouglas Crockforda. However JavaScript has evolved since then and I believe the naming conventions are now outdated.p  pFor example Crockford saidp  blockquote   pDo not use codecode underbar as the first character of a name. It is sometimes used to indicate privacy, but it does not actually provide privacy. If privacy is important, use the forms that provide a hrefhttpjavascript.crockford.comprivate.htmlprivate membersa. Avoid conventions that demonstrate a lack of competence.p blockquote  pHowever JavaScript now allows you to create nonenumerable properties. Hence it makes sense at least to me  youre allowed to disagree to prefix nonenumerable properties with an underbar to indicate that the property is nonenumerable.p  pWhy should you do sop  ol liBecause a hrefhttpworrydream.comLearnableProgramminglanguagevisual feedback is importanta scroll down to the readability section in the linked article.li liBackwards compatibility. You can filter out properties that begin with an underbar in codefor incode loops.li ol  pLets take another example of what Crockford saidp  blockquote   pGlobal variables should be in all caps. JavaScript does not have macros or constants, so there isnt much point in using all caps to signify features that JavaScript doesnt have.p blockquote  pAs I see it there are two problems with the following conventionp  ol liMost JavaScript programmers dont write global variables in all caps. Its just not natural.li liJavaScript now allows you to create nonwritable properties. Hence it makes sense to use all caps for such properties for the same reasons as I stated above for nonenumerable properties.li ol  hr  pAll thats well and fine, but whats the real question you ask Look at the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobalObjectsObjectdefinePropertiescodeObject.definePropertiescodea function. The problem is that you need to supply a property descriptor for each property you want to define. This is too verbose. For instancep  precodevar o  , x  0  Object.definePropertieso,      E          value Math.E,         enumerable true,         configurable true          x          enumerable true,         configurable true,         get function               return x         ,         set function y              x  y                codepre  pInstead it would be much better if you could simply dop  precodevar o  , x  0  defineo,      E Math.E,     get x          return x     ,     set xy          x  y       codepre  pThe codedefinecode function would be defined as followsp  precodevar define  function       var defineProperty  Object.defineProperty     var has  Function.call.bindObject.hasOwnProperty     var getDescriptorOf  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor      return function obj, props          for var key in props             if hasprops, key                 definePropertyobj, key,                     getDescriptorOfprops, key       codepre  pHowever now you cant make a property codenonenumerablecode, codenonconfigurablecode or codenonwritablecode easily. Hence I modified the codedefinecode function as followsp  precodevar define  function       var defineProperty  Object.defineProperty     var has  Function.call.bindObject.hasOwnProperty     var getDescriptorOf  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor      return function obj, props          for var key in props              if hasprops, key                  var descriptor  getDescriptorOfprops, key                  if key.charAt0                       descriptor.enumerable  false                  if key.charAtkey.length  1                       descriptor.configurable  false                  if hasdescriptor, value ampamp key  key.toUpperCase                     descriptor.writable  false                  definePropertyobj, key, descriptor                             codepre  pNow properties beginning with an underbar are nonenumerable, properties ending with an underbar are nonconfigurable and data descriptor properties which dont have any lowercase alphabets are nonwritable.p  pSo my question is this  is there any way to make properties nonenumerable, nonconfigurable or nonwritable easily while still adhering to Crockfords naming conventions I know that my own naming conventions have more merits. However I dont want to abandon Crockfords conventions too hastily.p

Negative 3829 pIm having a little bug in my program where you give the computer a random number to try to guess, and a range to guess between and the amount of guesses it has. After the computer generates a random number, it asks you if it is your number, if not, it asks you if it is higher or lower than it. My problem is, if your number is 50, and it generates 53, you would say l or lower or something that starts with l. Then it would generate 12 or something, you would say higher or something, and it might give you 72. How could I make it so that it remembers to be lower than 53p

Negative 3829 pI ran into a deadlock when implementing Karger Min Cut algorithm in Python. I broke my head but still cant figure out why my implementation does not work, while it works fine with pencil and paper...p  pConsider a graph with four nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 and five edgesp  pcode[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]code.p  pIn python, I represented them by two lists p  precodenodes  [1, 2, 3, 4] edges  [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]] codepre  pMy idea is randomly choose an edge, say code[1, 3]code, collapse it, remove codenode  3code from nodes list as if 3 is merged into 1 and, remove edge code[1, 3]code from edges list.p  pNow the two lists look like p  precodenodes  [1, 2, 4] edges  [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]] codepre  pAs 3 is merged into 1, the edges list is further updated to p  precodeedges  [[1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 4], [1, 4]]  codepre  pby changing all 3 in the resulting edges list to 1. p  pThis completes the first loop.p  pIn the second loop, suppose edge code[1, 2]code is randomly chosen from the edges list, then repeat the above steps I got so thatp  precodenodes  [1, 4] edges  [[2, 1], [2, 4], [1, 4]]  codepre  pwhich is further changed tocode[[1, 1], [1, 4], [1, 4]]code. As code[1, 1]code indicates a self loop, it is removed and the resulting edges list for this round is code[[1, 4], [1, 4]]codep  pAs the number of nodes is two, the process ends and the number of min cuts is 2, the length of the final edges list.p  pSo my implementation in Python is as followsp  precodeimport numpy as np   nodes  [] edges  []   f  openkargerMinCut.txt, r  The txt file has the form of an adjacency list  The link to the txt file is at the very end            for l in f     v  l.split      The first element of each line is a distinct      vertex and is appended to nodes list.         nodes.appendintv[0]     for u in v[1]          Edges list has the form as described in my 4 nodes example          above, which is unlike what in an typical adjacency list for          an undirected graph is. Here, if node 1 and node 2 share           an edge, then edge [1, 2] only appears once in the edges          list, edge [2, 1] is not, which is why I used set below.         edge  [intv[0]]         edge.appendintu         count  0         for edg in edges             if setedg  setedge                 count  1         if count  0             edges.appendedge  f.close   while lennodes gt 2      Number of current edges     m  lenedges      Choose a random edge uniformly      idx  np.random.randintm     edgeChosen  edges[idx]      Two corresponding nodes of the chosen edge     i  edgeChosen[0]     j  edgeChosen[1]       Remove the second one from nodes list     nodes.removej      Remove the chosen edge from edges list     del edges[idx]       Change all js to i     for ed in edges         for e in ed             if e  j                 e  i       Remove those [i, i] edges self loop     for ed in edges[]         if lenseted  1             edges.removeed   print lenedges codepre  pThis is just one run of the Karger Min Cut algorithm. Although those for loops in the while loop is inefficient, I just wanna have a try on this idea. I experimented the above code on an input with 200 nodes and 2000 edges. p  pBut no matter what I did, Python gives the following error after successfully removing a couple of nodes and edges p  precodenodes.removej ValueError list.removex x not in list codepre  pwhich is kind of funny. If codexcode is not in nodes list, it means codexcode is one of the js previously included in a chosen edge and was either removed or changed to the corresponding i. p  pHowever, I cannot find what is wrong with my code.

So there are cells which arent filled, until I add a new test.  Do you have any idea what I can do  p  pThank you very muchp

Negative 3829 pIm building an API and trying to figure out Authentication in a number of contexts.p  h2Sessions and Password Authenticationh2  pThe API needs to serve clientside applications we create and deploy, and handle authenticated requests using a password. Its not a great idea to send the password with every request, so it makes more sense to first hit a login endpoint and get a session id. The webapp in question is written in AngularJS, and should track its own session in localStorage to mitigate session hijacking and remove the dependency on cookies to track sessions.p  pThe webapp would need to send the session identifier with every request, and currently does so in the body of the request. This fragments pretty easily and becomes tightly coupled with the API. I would much rather pass all authentication information in one waythrough a header, preferablyinstead of in a number of different fields spread across the request body, url and headers.p  h3Session Storageh3  pa hrefhttpredis.ioRedisa is awesome, of course. Session storage is straightforward and automatically garbagecollects. Unfortunately, sessions in redis are difficult to manage I cannot easily revoke all sessions for a given user. Adding that capability by storing sessions in a true redisdatastructure instead of the global keyspace removes the ability to add keyed TTLs. My current solution is to store a list of sessions in the MongoDB user collection, and garbagecollect expired sessions on session activity loginlogout, for instance.p  pThe sessions are stored in redis with the a hrefhttpsgithub.comvisionmediaconnectredisconnectredisa module, but as they are sent with every request arent included in the cookies. At the moment, I have a small piece of middleware that takes the session identifier out of the request body and puts it into a codereq.cookiescode object.p  precodevar express  requireexpress var RedisStore  requireconnectredisrequireconnect  var app  express app.usefunctionreq, res, next    req.cookies  session req.body.session  app.useexpress.session   store new RedisStore     client redisClient,     prefix session   ,   key session,   secret all mine  codepre  pThis approach works fine, except that codeexpress.sessioncode ends up setting the cookie when express responds, and thats not the desired behavior.p  pHow do I set this up properly in the context of Expressp  h2API Keysh2  pOur API should also support API keys for thirdparty applications to gain limited and controlled access to our system. The most common mechanism I know of to do this is to distribute API keys to interested developers, and have the developer pass the API key in as part of the request. This runs into the same dilemma that sessionpassword authentication runs into every API expects the API key in a different part of the request, from the body to the url to the headers.p  h2Expansion and Open Standardsh2  pWhile we do not plan on supporting Open authentication standards like OpenAuth and OpenID at initial release, we do wish to create a framework in which the addition of said standards is straightforward. Part of that could be to unify how authorization credentials are handed to the API, as with sessionpassword and API Key backed authentication.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7802116 titleCustom HTTP Authorization HeaderAnother questiona asks whether customizing the HTTP codeAuthorizationcode header is a good idea, or if a custom header is a better idea.p  h2CRUD Supporth2  pIn order to support the CRUD paradigm for RESTful APIs, it makes sense to not provide authentication information in the body as that would limit all API requests to POST requests, whereas CRUD recommends use of a variety of HTTP methods.p  h3TLDRh3  pTwo thingsp  ol liHow can we use a module like a hrefhttpsgithub.comvisionmediaconnectredisconnectredisa without using cookiebased sessions.li liHow should we configure authentication information for maximum flexibility and interoperabilityli ol

Find all entries in the question table, where question.surveyId  surveyId. 2.

Negative 3829 pI am developing a webapp with jquery mobile and in an html file I have a datarel attribute of a link set to dialog. Datatransition is set to fade. The problem is, that after clicking a button which is linking to another html file Chrome says Error loading page. I found the solution for that and adding relexternal does the job, but it destroys my fade transition. Firefox seems not to have this strange behaviour and links me to the desired page without having relexternal, so the transition works. I could stay with Firefox, but Id like to test my app on different browsers. Any suggestions Many thanks in advancep

Negative 3829 pIm building an iOS 7 app to run on iPads and iPhones.  The physical devices I have for testing are an iPhone 5 and an iPad 2.p  pThis has all been working fine but recently, a new issue has appeared.  p  pAfter I build for the iPad, Xcodes title bar says that my build was successful  but then, a second or two later, a red circle with an exclamation mark appears on the right end of the title bar  indicating that I have issues currently, 6.p  pThis only occurs when I am building for the iPad.  The emulator and the iPhone builds do not do this.p  pThe iPad build, itself, appears fine.  I can load it onto the iPad and run and debug it.  I can see the effects of my latest changes in code there so I know Im not running a older version.p  pIf I click on the red circle in the Xcode title bar, Im shown what the issues are and they seen very unlikely to me.p  pAn examplep  precodeextern PIMG gImage lt complaint Unknown type name PIMG codepre  pI use the PIMG symbol all over my code.  The code is identical for both the iPhone and the iPad and the iPhone builds this fine.  If I replace the symbol with UIImage  which is what it symbolizes, and then rebuild, this partucular line no longer gives me trouble but the others continue to appear.p  pAnd note, that after I replace PIMG with UIImage  and rebuild, there still remain dozens of other instances of the PIMG symbol scattered through my code that are not provoking errors.p  pIn an effort to fix these issues, I have done Cleans before I build and I have gone to the Organizer and cleared the derived data for this project.  p  pNone of these actions seem to have any effect.p  pI know that Xcode is constantly working in the background.  If, for example, I change a variable name at the top of a subroutine, XCode knows that Ive done this quite quickly and it shows me that variables lower down are now undefined and highlights them.p  pIm wondering if it is this background system that is getting confused about whether or not my symbols are all resolving correctly.p  pAny thoughts on what might be happening and how to further debug itp

Negative 3829 pI have been able to create a grid using an image file serves as the empty circles, a loop, and GridLayout, but I am well aware that theres more functionality needed like for dropping the token, though no animation is necessary yet so I scrapped it and now Im back to an empty grid. I am stuck and Im not really sure how I can accomplish this. My code is a mess at the moment so Im not sure if itd even make sense for me to post it.p  pMy main problem is how to build a grid, which will then just be filled with a solid color Im cancelling using an image file, it seems a little more complicated as far as Im concerned with empty circles, that I will be able to fill up with an image file of a token once the player clicks on a button that corresponds to the column he chose and then reset everything after the game is over. In other words, a rectangle of solid color and with empty circles to be filled up by tokens, but not with solid color, but an image file.p  pI have been trying to familiarize myself with codepaintcode but I only started learning GUI last week so there are still likely some more things Ill have to learn to probably understand it in a considerable degree.p  pI am running out of options tantamount to my knowledge of GUI Swing in particular and I have been trying to work on this for a week now.p  pAny hintsp

Negative 3829 pI have a JContextMenu that I open in a JDialog by calling the MouseListener is registered to the JDialogp  precodemenu.showe.getComponent, e.getX, e.getY codepre  pThe menu itself has an ActionListener registered on the menuitems. It opens fine and the actions are performed as expected, until I open another menu for example the applications main menu or a context menu on another component that overlaps something else. For example if a menu in the main menu bar overlaps a dialog or if a context menu is opened that reaches outside the window. Then the clicks on the context menu of the JDialog just close the context menu, as if you had clicked beside the menu to close it the other menus in the application are still fine though.p  pIts as if the click goes through the menu. If I select a menu item with the arrow keys and press enter, it does the action just fine.p  pIf I specify e.g. the main window of the application as invoker in the codemenu.showcode, then it seems to always work but of course it opens on the wrong location. What seems to work is registering the mouse listener on the content pane of the JDialog instead.p  pCan anyone explain what can cause this behaviour Should a JDialog not be used as invoker of a context menu for some reasonp  pI also tried using codesetComponentPopupMenucode, but that only seems to exist for JComponent and not JDialog or its content pane. Using it on a component inside the JDialog works, but so does the other method of using a mouse listener and codemenu.showcode.p

Negative 3829 pIve got this really deep code Im working with, which layersuponlayers down uses strongRequest.Filesstrong to access any files uploaded to a webform and does some processing on them. I dont really have the authority to modify the code at that level, so hence my problem.p  pMy mission is to create a generic function that will accept a simple stringlist of URLs and extract the data from them in order to perform the exact same processing that would be done if these files were uploaded via the webform. In order to do this without being allowed to modify the lowlevel code, I need to find a way to programmatically assign data to strongRequest.Filesstrong from within my c code so that when it gets called later on its filled with my data.p  pMy plan is to open a stream to the URLs to extract the file data, massage the data into some compatible object list, then hopefully do something like...p  precodeRequest.Files  MyFileListFromURLs codepre  pmakes sense, ya Except its not seeming that easy. Anyone want to offer some guidance perhaps there is a more correct way to do this, such as indirectly adding files to strongRequest.Filesstrong by some other methodp
Negative 3829 pI just went through the tutorial on writing a Java servlet using the example at a hrefhttpwww.vogella.comtutorialsEclipseWTParticle.html relnofollowhttpwww.vogella.comtutorialsEclipseWTParticle.htmlap  pWhat isnt clear to me is how developers implement methods inside this servlet that can be called by a client. The doGet method is where the http request lands. One way is to pass in a querystring, post body or header that contains information indicating a method to execute and then just create a class with methods to carry out based upon which method was indicated.p  pOr is there a more builtin way that a Java servlet can wrap methods and method parameters in the client callp

Negative 3829 pI have a project where we write a small amount of data to a file every 5 minutes. The idea is to look at how this data changes over a period of hours, days, and weeks. p  pOne of the requirements is to store this data in a secure format. We already have an encryption scheme for sending this data across a network as a byte[] array via DataIO streams. p  pThe question I have is this, is there a way to write encrypted byte[] arrays to a text file in such a way that I can read them back out My biggest problem at the moment is that Im reading Strings from the files, which messes up the byte[] arrays. p  pAny thoughts or pointers on where to gop
Negative 3829 pIm currently implementing a sparse matrix for my matrix library  it will be a hash table. I already implemented a dense matrix as a nested vector, and since Im doing it just to learn new stuff, I decided that my matrices will be multidimensional not just a 2D table of numbers, but also cubes, tesseracts, etc.p  pI use an index type which holds n numbers of type codesizetcode, n being a number of dimensions for this particular index. Index of dimension codencode may be used only as an address of an element in a matrix of appropriate dimension. It is simply a tuple with implicit constructor for easy indexing, like codeMatrix[1,2,3]code.p  pMy question is centered around the hashing function I plan on using for my sparse matrix implementation. I think that the function is always minimal, but is perfect only up to a certain point  to the point of codesizetcode overflow, or an overflow of intermediate operation of the hashing function they are actually codeunsigned long longcode. Sparse matrices have huge boundaries, so its practically guaranteed to overflow at some point see below.p  pWhat the hashing function does is assign consecutive numbers to matrix elements as followsp  precode[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ...]T transposed 1dimensional matrix  1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6 9 2dimensional matrix codepre  pand so on. Unfortunately, Im unable show you the ordering for higher order matrices, but I hope that you get the idea  the value increases top to bottom, left to right, back to front for cube matrices, etc.p  pThe hashing function is defined like this p  pcodevalue  x1d1x2d1d2x3d1d2d3x3...d1d2d3...dn1xncodep  pwhere p  ul lix1...xn are index members  row, column, height, etc  x1, x2, x3, ..., xn li lid1...dn1 are matrix boundary dimensions  one past the end of matrix in the appropriate directionli ul  pIm actually using a recursive form of this function simple factoring, but complexity becomes On instead of On2p  pcodevalue  x1d1x2d2x3d3...xn1dn1xn...codep  pIm assuming that elements will be distributed randomly uniform across the matrix, but the bucket number is codehashkey mod numberOfBucketscode, so it is practically guaranteed to have collisions despite the fact, that the function is perfect. p  ol liIs there any way to exploit the features of my hash function in order to minimize collisions li liHow should I choose the load factor Should I leave the choice to the user Is there any good default value for this caseli liIs the hash table actually a good solution for this problem Are there any other data structures that guarantee average O1 complexity given that I can roll the index into  a number and a number into an index mind the codesizetcode overflow I am aware of different ways to store a sparse matrix, but I want to try the DOK way first.li ol
Negative 3829 pI realise that this question has been asked a lot and ive read the first 2 pages of google about it but i couldnt find an answer that worked.  Basically i want a ListView with custom items, each one should have a checkbox. How can i make it so that when i click a checkbox the equivalent of listView.setItemCheckedint, boolean... would happen  Some of the answers ive found required having another boolean in the list objects, or some would reuse the checkboxes so they reappear checked further down the list. Is there a way to have a checkbox modify something in the listView or how could i add multiple listeners to a list item For example when i clicked the text something would happen but clicking the image would trigger something else Thanks.p

Negative 3829 pAs an example, at work we have an offers table with a start and end date. If the offer is always running it may be that the start of end date has a NULL value. I came a across a query which was having to do something like thisp  precodeWHERE  ISNULLenddate OR enddate gt 20140101 000000  ... codepre  pI wanted to see if using BETWEEN would work, even if the start of end date was NULL.p  precodeselect 20140424 145442 BETWEEN 20140424 145441 AND 20140424 145443  1 select 20140424 145442 BETWEEN 20140424 145443 AND 20140424 145441  0 select 20140424 145442 BETWEEN 20140424 145443 AND 20140424 145443  0  select 20140424 145442 BETWEEN 20140424 145443 AND NULL  0 select 20140424 145442 BETWEEN NULL AND 20140424 145441  0 select 20140424 145442 BETWEEN NULL AND 20140424 145443  NULL select 20140424 145442 BETWEEN 20140424 145441 AND NULL  NULL codepre  pIt seems to make sense when you get the NULL result for the last two queries as MySQL cant say for certain that the date is between the 2 values but from the data it does it its not false. As we are using NULL for effectively low and high values, we could take NULL as true for this business logic.p  pIs this actually what MySQL is saying here Or is this more of a quirk and should not be relied onp  pServer version 5.6.1664.256log Percona Server GPL, Release 64.2, Revision 569p

Negative 3829 pThis is part of the jquery script I use to automatically showhide sidebar based on screen size, both on document load and afterwards during screenbrowser resize e.g. landscapeportrait modes. Yes, I use it in combination with media queries, but that is not the issue here. jQuery is needed to do the auto part and for toggling not shown here.p  precodeltscriptgt     document.readyfunction          var sidebar  sidebar         var advsearch  advsearch  autohide function         var resize  function              if window.width gt 650                   sidebar.show                 advsearch.hide              else                  sidebar.hide                 advsearch.show                               resize         window.resizeresize      ltscriptgt codepre  pThe problem exists with some Android 2.1 devices and their stock browser. The above script automatically hides sidebar on a slightest screen size change function updates and continuosly monitors users screen size, and when I browse the page and toggle to show sidebar, the smallest scroll on page triggers jquery function, which thinks the screen resolution has changed and revisits the function  effectivle hiding again sidebar that was just toggledactivatedp  pReason for this is most probably because of Android 2.1 browsers vertical scroll bar that somehow affects screen size during page vertical scroll, so the content of sidebar div can never be properly reached by the user. This does not happen in newer versionsdevices, but it is annoying.p  pSolutionsp  pBasic idea is to drop later part of the jquery code and make the script less smart solution I currently use.p  pSecond idea is to retain jquery autohide function, but to add some tollerance to the window.resize function. E.g. when the screen is resized up to 10px from the current size whichever it is, resize function will not be triggered.p  pFor example, let us say current screen size is 400px, so the condition to hide sidebar by above function is fullfilled again doesnt matter if sidebar div was displayed or hiden before via toggle button for e.g., it will NOT be hidden untill windowscreen size of the devicebrowser does not pass 389px or beyond 411px.p  pI have trouble creating the logic that will set up a range condition for resize function. Also, another problem would be how to temporarely fix comparing variables 390px and 410px in above example, because the moment screen changes, the variables used for relative comparison will be recalculated.p  pAny idea for this solution Thanksp

Negative 3829 pAndroid keyboard has a button that switches the input language. How can I change the input language  programmatically without using this button My app has different textboxes where the user enters information in different languages and when the user switches from one field to another the input language will be changed automatically to the correct one. Android keyboard is a standalone application, so I need to manage this language changing from my application. The only thing that I found is switchToNextInputMethod method in InputMethodManager class but Im not sure if it fits.p

Negative 3829 pstrongEDIT I think I might have a roundabout way to deal with the issue.strongp  pstrongSince Im starting from the zpk representation, just split the higher order filter into two smaller order filters.strongp  pstrongFor example, instead of designing a filter with 5 poles and 5 zeros, design Filter A with three poles and three zeros and Filter B with two poles and two zeros. Then filter with Filter A and then filter with Filter B. This should be equivalent and I tested it at low sampling rates since at low sampling rates I dont see this issue seems to have positive results.strongp  pIm using the scipy.signal module to implement a filter where I designate 5 zeros all at 100Hz, and 5 poles all at 1Hz. Im looking at the frequency response of the digital filter and it doesnt look like the analog filter at low frequencies.p  pIve noticed that if I lower the sampling rate, then it matches pretty well eg. lowering from 16384Hz to 4096Hz. Or if I lower the order of the filter, then it matches better too.p  pCould someone explain how to match the analog and digital frequency responses betterp  pExample images below.p  p4096Hz black analog filter magnitude, blue digital filter magnitude notice some difference at low frequenciesp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comlsbzhtV.png altx title4096Hz frequency responsep  p16384Hz the match a low frequencies is worsep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.compjtdm8q.png altx title16384Hz frequency responsep  pFor examplep  precodeimport numpy as np import scipy.signal import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   define zpk filter and sampling rate z  np.array[2np.pi100., 2np.pi100., 2np.pi100., 2np.pi100., 2np.pi100.], dtypenp.float64 p  np.array[2np.pi1., 2np.pi1., 2np.pi1., 2np.pi1., 2np.pi1.] k  1. 100.5 samplerate  16384   get analog coefficients analogcoefficients  scipy.signal.zpk2tfz, p, k   get digital coefficients digitalcoefficients  scipy.signal.bilinearanalogcoefficients[0], analogcoefficients[1], samplerate   get frequency response wa,ha  scipy.signal.freqsanalogcoefficients[0], analogcoefficients[1], 220 w,h  scipy.signal.freqzdigitalcoefficients[0], digitalcoefficients[1], 220 w  w  samplerate  2 np.pi wa  wa  2 np.pi    plot frequency response  blue   digital magnitude  black  analog magnitude fig  plt.figure plt.titleDigital filter frequency response ax1  fig.addsubplot111 plt.semilogxw, 20  np.log10absh, b plt.semilogxwa, 20  np.log10absha, k plt.ylabelmagnitude [dB] plt.xlabelfrequency [Hz] plt.grid plt.axistight plt.xlim[0.001, samplerate2] plt.show codepre  pThanks.p
Negative 3829 pI need to insert a data from a table which has a foreach loop inside. I used to work with webforms so Im newbie to mvc. I always encountered this scenario in webforms using gridview control and just implement the findcontrol command and it works fine. But in mvc, I could hardly get the solutions how to do it. I already search online but cant find any articles that fits my needs for this type of issue. So far, what Ive got is if I insert a data from a first row of the table it will insert the record but if I insert them from the second, third, and so fourth, it will no longer insert the records into my database table.

Negative 3829 pI have a webapp that renders a chart as per the user input by pulling out the data from a oracle database. I want the chart to be rendered on a new popup window so that the chart is persisted from different user input. i want to do this so that the user can render multiple charts in separate popup windows with different filters for the data to acquired from the db with the same button click multiple clicks and separate filter values of course and then do comparison between the charts as per they wish. so if there are 10 diff filters and the user wants to see the graphs with any combination of them  he will specify separate filter values each time and hit the button to render the chart in a separate new pop up and the previous popup with previous chart should persist.  I am not really good with javascripts. i found some solutions to use modal popups from ajax and some other with the help of javascripts  none of which seems to serve my purpose. any help would be really appreciated.  i am using .net 4.5, asp and c thanks.p  pEDIT 1 for DJ KRAZEbr So here is the basic layout of my page sorry that i have to hide most of the part because of security reasons. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIgfYL.jpg altImagebr As evident all the filters are there to be used to filter out a database and then plot the result as the chart shown. The code behind is absolutely simple C, nothing fancy. Now what I want is to render that chart in a separate popup window not attached to the page itself so that the chart persists if the user decides not to close it and another popup window opens when the user hits submit again with different filter values. so far i have referred to this example and some other javascript related example that does open popups but will not persist if the user has to change the filters a hrefhttpajlearning.comblogshowgridviewpopupwindowaspnet relnofollowlink to exampleap

Were only serving up static content, but since IIS in running in integrated mode I was under the impression that HttpModules were executed for all requests, not just those in the ASP.NET pipeline.p  pThe HttpModule has been reduced to the simplest possible level  logging when the module is created, disposed of, a request begins and a request ends, as belowp  precodeusing System using System.Web using System.Collections.Specialized using System.IO  public class ServerLoggingModule  IHttpModule      public ServerLoggingModule             using StreamWriter file  new StreamWriterCLocalIISAuthlogsiis.log                    file.WriteLineCreated module                   public string ModuleName              get  return ServerMaskModule            public void Dispose              using StreamWriter file  new StreamWriterCLocalIISAuthlogsiis.log                      file.WriteLineDisposed of module                        public void InitHttpApplication context              context.BeginRequest  new EventHandlerServerLoggingModule.BeginRequestHandler         context.EndRequest  new EventHandlerServerLoggingModule.EndRequestHandler           protected static void BeginRequestHandlerObject sender, EventArgs e              using StreamWriter file  new StreamWriterCLocalIISAuthlogsiis.log                      file.WriteLineBeginRequest                    protected static void EndRequestHandlerObject sender, EventArgs e              using StreamWriter file  new StreamWriterCLocalIISAuthlogsiis.log                      file.WriteLineEndRequest                codepre  pThe request reaches the point in the pipeline the module resides at, but just seems to skip the module.

Negative 3829 pHello stackoverflow community, p  pI am afraid this is another beginners question, but my search has not really helped me to implement what I need to do, so I am hoping that someone can give me some more concrete advice here.p  pI have a 4D matrix from which I want to extract certain values they are technically points in a coordinate system. I then want to measure the distance between these values and a point on a linear function in the following wayp  pMy first set of data points would be set1  Matrix1,1,,1, my second set2  Matrix1,1,,2 and so forth. Each of these sets would then be compared against one point on the aforementioned linear function which is different for each dataset and I want to store the results in a separate vector for each dataset. At first I started using the squeeze command to store the sets as separate vectors, but its becoming a bit laborious. Any ideas on how to improve this Should I just write a very elaborate loop to extract the right values form the original 4D matrix without storing them separately firstp  pAt this point I would also ideally like to have a function that iterates over each point in each dataset vector and then calculates the distance between the point and the specified point on the linear function before storing it in a difference vector.  So it would be something likep  precodefor i1lengthset1 difference  pdist2set1i,Y,euclidean codepre  pSorry if this is unclear, I always find it difficult to describe these issues verbally. I am happy to answer any questions. p  pThank youp

Negative 3829 pOur application has a table called cargoitems. It can be seen as kind of a queue to later process these items. Initially there was a SINGLE job which took 3000 entries and processed them one after another. Later on, somebody decided to start 3 other instances of the same job. What happened is quite obvious, many of the items were processed twice. p  pMy job is to make these processes working correctly if at the same time many instances are running. The solution I am going for now is to mark 3000 entries in the database with a jobid and later on fetch all of these entities and process them isolated from the other processes. p  pMy current approach for flagging this rows is the following p  precodeUPDATE cargoitem item SET jobid  SOMEUUID, jobts  now FROM       SELECT id    FROM   cargoitem    WHERE  stateNEW AND jobid is null     LIMIT  3000    FOR UPDATE     sub WHERE  item.id  sub.id codepre  pBasically this approach locks the 3000 rows for a update. I am not sure if it is a good approach though. p  pOn another a hrefhttpdba.stackexchange.comquestions69471postgresupdatelimit1threada I read about using advisory locks for this scenario. p  pWhat do you guys think about the current approach and using advisory lock insteadp  h2strongUPDATEstrongh2  pAs suggested, Id adapt the update statement like this p  precodeUPDATE cargoitem item SET jobid  SOMEUUID, jobts  now FROM       SELECT id    FROM   cargoitem    WHERE  stateNEW AND jobid is null     ORDER  BY id    LIMIT  3000    FOR UPDATE     sub WHERE  item.id  sub.id codepre  pThx Erwin and Tometzky for the hint.

Negative 3829 pI am building an application where the user can see a contactlist similar to contactlist in WhatsApp. Therefor I thought about 3 steps to get this list In the first step all phonenumbers from the phone should be collected in an arraylist. In the next step this arraylist should be send to the server to check which numbers are matching who has the same application. The matching numbers should be returned. In the last step the application should collect the fitting names to the returned numbers for displaying names the user has created in his phone. The first and the third step ist still working, but the second step is quite tricky. I tried to use for and foreach loop, but its not working... In the current running version I insert one existing number in the code and it is working.

Negative 3829 pIm dealing with the following problem in graphs matchings. Let G  V,E be an undirected graph, and let S,T subgroups of V be two sets of vertices with no common neighbours. That is, there exist no vertices s in S, t in T, and v in V such that s,v t,v in E note that there may still be edges between S and T or within S or T.p  pI wanna show that if there exists a matching in G in which all vertices in S are covered, and also a possibly different matching in which all vertices in T are covered, then there also exists a matching in G in which all vertices in S union T are covered.p  pI think the solution is related to the algorithm for finding maximal matching with augmenting paths, and the fact that no common neighbors exists.

Negative 3829 pSo Ive got a concept of how to do this  but actually implementing me is a bit of a stumper for myself mostly due to my lack of regex experience  but lets get into it.p  pId like to parse through a php file that could contain something like the followingp  precodeltphp function Something   gt  lthtmlgt ltbodygt lt Something gt ltbodygt lthtmlgt  ltphp  Some more code or something gt codepre  pIf interpreted exactly  the above is worthless jibberish  but it is a good example of what Id like to be able to parse, or interpret...p  pThe idea is that I would read the contents of the above file, and break it out into an ordered array of its respective pieces while tracking what type each segment is, so that I can either simply echo it, or run an eval on it.p  pEffectively, Id like to end up with an array something like thisp  precodeFileSegments  array  FileSegments[0][type]  PHP FileSegments[0][content]       function Something            FileSegments[1][type]  HTML FileSegments[1][content]       lthtmlgt     ltbodygt  FileSegments[2][type]  PHP FileSegments[2][content]  Something codepre  pAnd so on...p  pThe initial idea was to simply include or require the file in question, and grab its output from the output buffer  but it dawned on me that I would like to be able to inject some top level variables into each one of these files before evaluating the code. To do this, I would have to eval my injected code, with the contents of the file after said injection  but in order to do this with the ability to handle raw HTML in the file too, I would have to basically write a temporary clone of the whole file, that just had my injected code written before the actual contents... Cumbersome, and slow.p  pI hope youre all following here... If not I can clarify...p  pThe only other piece I feel I should note before finalizing this question is that I would like to retain any variables or symbols in general  for instance the Something function  created in segments 0 and 2, for instance, and pass them down to segment 4... I feel like this might be achievable using the extract method, and then manually writing in those pieces of data before my next segment executes  but again Im shooting a little in the dark on that.p  pIf anyone has a better approach, or can give me some brief code on just extracting these segments out of a file, I would be ecstatic.p  pemcheersemp  pETA It dawns on me that I can probably pose this question a little more simply If there isnt a simple way to do the above, is there a way to handle a String in the emexactem same way that require and include handle a Filep

Negative 3829 pI cant find any documentation on what coveralls provides coverage reports for in Rails, and I need something for views coverage. Does coveralls provide views coveragep
Negative 3829 pI have a Movieclip level 1, MC with around 10 frames. There is a different movieclip level 2, Move Jump etc animation on each frame. Inside each of the level 2 movieclips, there are about 30 movieclip symbols level 3, Head Arm etc each spamming about 100 frames with around 3050 keyframes. Each level 3 symbol has around 10 frames, on each frame I have a particular skin graphic.p  pI have all the level 2 and level 3 symbols instance named same label across timeline for the same object, and I have the right frames stop and labelled. I also understand that everytime I enter a new frame in not just level 1 but also level 2, I have to reset all the level 3 symbols to the desired frame, because my previous settings will be destroyed upon leaving frame.p  pI got it working by doing level1.gotoAndStoplevel2name  level1.level2.level3.gotoAndStopskintype and then loop over a nasty nasty number of poses X bodyparts. AND this process needs to be performed in an ENTERFRAME event since everything will be reset again. Needless to say, I really really dont want to do it this way.p  pOne of the alternatives is breaking the graphics up and have many many level 2 poses movieclips inside my level 1 MC movieclip mage hit by warrior 3rd attack, warrior hit by rogue 4th attack.... Thats what I used to do before. But for this project, a simple calculation tells me I need to make 200 animations that way, which is not feasible. I can also get rid of level 1 MC and have the poses saved into an array, but the bodyparts still need to be refreshed every frame.p  pIm hoping that theres a relatively quick fix to this that I managed to miss, as it seems like such a basic feature, Im sure many flash games will have to go through it dress up, or anything with customization  animation really. Yet somehow Ive been searching for days and cant find a cure. The authortime ability to simply swap out graphics within a symbol to replace every frame of every animation in the entire file also suggests that theres gotta be a more universal approach to these swapping. I hope you can prove me rightp  pI do have 2 things that I dont know if I should even bother trying 1 Drag the MC onto frame1 my only frame, where I currently have nothing but code. 2 Declare each bodypart individually AND declare MC, then have MCs parts link to these bodyparts. Basically, I just need a viable method to keep these bodyparts from resetting everytime the animation goes to a new frame, my flash knowledge is not enough to tell me whether if its even possible to have these global graphics bank independent of frames.p  pAnd yes I know Im probably not doing it in the most clean way possible, but I simply animate better with visuals, so while I CAN start from shapes and animate everything using strictly code I REALLY want to move away from it. The art style is pretty important in this project.p  pUPDATE For now, I went for the ugly route. Everytime the MC changes animation, I do p  pMovieClipDisplayObjectContainerMC.getChildByNameMC.move.Hand.gotoAndStopMC.skinnamep  pAnd repeat that for all 35 body parts. Turns out that flash replaces all frames of hand in the MC.move, which makes life a lot easier. The alternative is to poll for every single frame, but the direct consequence is MUCH slower fps. Instead, right now I only need to switch graphics whenever there is a change to the moves.p  pThis works, but Im aware that it slows down performance quite a bit. In fact it can slow down performance in the same magnitude as the actual vector rendering. Limiting the swapping to only move changes is really not optional but mandatory.p

Negative 3829 pemWhat is the best way to approach the database design for a groupbuying siteemp  pIf you are not familiar with group buying, people purchase a deal, and when n amount of people purchase the deal, the deal is activated and the product is shipped to the people who ordered the deal. However, the deal does not ship until n people buy it. Moreover, the requirement is that a single deal can have many groupbuys, meaning that once n amount of people buy the deal, the deal does not close, but rather restarts for k amount of times.p  pWhat I thought of was to have a deal table that has many group tables where each of the groups represents one of the k number of times the deal can be group buyed, and each group table has n amount of order tables. The group is activated when the group table has the correct n threshold number of orders for that deal.p  precodeAn example     Deal gt Group gt order                    gt order                     gt Group  codepre  pstrongSome problems I have with this designstrongp  ol lipUpon initialization of the deal, you have to create all the n group rows that will be related to the deal, even though some of the n groups may not have any orders especially if nobody purchases the deal. Thus, someone could easily specify to be able to groupbuy the deal 100,000 times making us create 100,000 rows, even if nobody group buys their product. Plus, if that person wants to delete their deal, we have to delete 100,000 rows.pli lipKeeping track of the groups is a pain. When you process an order how do you know which group to add the order to What if somebody or everybody wants a refund within a group, then which group do we add a new order to, since their might be one group with some people, and another group with some people. pli ol

Negative 3829 pSo far as Ive seen, Clojures core functions almost always work for different types of collection, e.g. codeconjcode, codefirstcode, coderestcode, etc. Im a little puzzled why codedisjcode and codedissoccode are different though they have the exact same signaturep  precodedissoc map dissoc map key dissoc map key amp ks disj set disj set key disj set key amp ks codepre  pand fairly similar semantics.

Negative 3829 pI have an MVC application which allows users to sell items and upload images associated with each item. I am using Azure Blob storage to store the images. Once the image is stored in Azure, the MVC backend might retrieve it and resize it usually shrink it before sending it to the client, depending on requirements. Is there anyway I can request a file from Azure and have Azure resize it for me This would save on the expense of sending a large image file to my MVC controller, which I then resize and stream to the client. Of course, I know I could save multiple copies of each image in Azure, each with the size I might need.p

Negative 3829 pCurrently, I have an MFC C visual studio project that is built to a DLL. Lets call it the strongFinalDLLstrong.p  pI need this strongFinalDLLstrong to be configurable. So, I want a GUI such that the users can generate the strongFinalDLLstrong based on the information the enter via GUI. Please consider that I dont want to make the sources available at any points.p  pI do not have a clear idea how to integrate these steps. The solution I came up with was to have something like a button in my GUI, so that when it is clicked, the strongFinalDLLstrong gets generated based on the information entered via GUI. Is it possible to do something like that Probably I need another DLL library, as the information entered via GUI can be calls to functions that are used inside the strongFinalDLLstrong source.p

Negative 3829 pI have a problem that has similar symptoms to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28478797mobilefirstadapterisnotdeployingThis questiona where adapter deployment hangs at 66 complete. As Im not sure its the same problem Im starting this new question.p  pUsing MFP 7.0.0, freshly installed on a new instance of Eclipse Luna.p  pI have a SQL Adapter that normally can be deployed with no difficulty, and these days if one edits the source that deployment occurs automatically.p  pAs it happens I want to use a database only accessible via a VPN. So initially I developed some SQL scripts in the Database perspective. Using a JDBC URL of this formp  precodejdbcdb2the.vpn.host60006STUDENT codepre  pMy scripts work just fine. Now with the VPN still active I attempt to modify my SQL adapter to use that URL, automatic deployment kicks in and bingo, we get to the p  blockquote   pDeploy Mobile First adapter 66 p blockquote  pstage and nothing further happens, ever, this is not just a few minutes timeout, it will sit there for hours. As soon as I drop the VPN the deployment completes. p  pSo my question is twofoldp  p1. It seems clear that some aspect of the adapter deployment code is not resilient to network issue  its clearly not acceptable to hang indefinitely. I speculate that this may hint at the underlying cause of the referenced question.p  p2. There must be some network peculiarity here. I assume that the deployment process is having trouble reaching the server when the VPN is active. How can I diagnose thisp

Negative 3829 pIve two same MySQL databases present at two different servers. Initially both the databases have the exactly same structure and contained the same data. p  pBut later on few new recordsnew users got added to both the tables.

Replacing the codeboostthisthreadsleepforcode with codestdthisthreadsleepforcode fixes the issue however, I need the interruptible feature of codeboostthreadcode and the interruption point that codeboostthisthreadsleepforcode provides.p  pHere is some sample code illustrating the issuep  precodeinclude ltboostthread.hppgt include ltboostchrono.hppgt  include ltchronogt include ltiostreamgt include ltthreadgt  void boostThreadFunction      stdcout ltlt Starting Boost thread ltlt stdendl    for int i  0 i lt 10 i           auto sleeptime  boostchronomilliseconds 29000  100  i       auto mark  stdchronosteadyclocknow        boostthisthreadsleepfor sleeptime       auto duration  stdchronodurationcastltstdchronomillisecondsgt          stdchronosteadyclocknow   mark       stdcout ltlt Boost thread ltlt stdendl       stdcout ltlt tSupposed to sleep fort ltlt sleeptime.count                   ltlt  ms ltlt stdendl       stdcout ltlt tActually slept fort ltlt duration.count                   ltlt  ms ltlt stdendl ltlt stdendl       void stdThreadFunction      stdcout ltlt Starting Std thread ltlt stdendl    for int i  0 i lt 10 i           auto sleeptime  stdchronomilliseconds 29000  100  i       auto mark  stdchronosteadyclocknow        stdthisthreadsleepfor sleeptime       auto duration  stdchronodurationcastltstdchronomillisecondsgt          stdchronosteadyclocknow   mark       stdcout ltlt Std thread ltlt stdendl       stdcout ltlt tSupposed to sleep fort ltlt sleeptime.count                   ltlt  ms ltlt stdendl       stdcout ltlt tActually slept fort ltlt duration.count                   ltlt  ms ltlt stdendl ltlt stdendl       int main      boostthread boostthread ampboostThreadFunction    stdthisthreadsleepfor stdchronoseconds 10    stdthread stdthread ampstdThreadFunction    boostthread.join     stdthread.join     return 0  codepre  pHere is the output when referencing Boost 1.58 as an include directory and running on my workstation Windows 7 64bitp  precodeStarting Boost thread Starting Std thread Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29000 ms         Actually slept for     29690 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29000 ms         Actually slept for     29009 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29100 ms         Actually slept for     29999 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29100 ms         Actually slept for     29111 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29200 ms         Actually slept for     29990 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29200 ms         Actually slept for     29172 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29300 ms         Actually slept for     30005 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29300 ms         Actually slept for     29339 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29400 ms         Actually slept for     30003 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29400 ms         Actually slept for     29405 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29500 ms         Actually slept for     29999 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29500 ms         Actually slept for     29472 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29600 ms         Actually slept for     29999 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29600 ms         Actually slept for     29645 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29700 ms         Actually slept for     29998 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29700 ms         Actually slept for     29706 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29800 ms         Actually slept for     29998 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29800 ms         Actually slept for     29807 ms  Boost thread         Supposed to sleep for  29900 ms         Actually slept for     30014 ms  Std thread         Supposed to sleep for  29900 ms         Actually slept for     29915 ms codepre  pI would expect the codestdthreadcode and the codeboostthreadcode to sleep for the same amount of time however, the codeboostthreadcode seems to want to sleep for 30 seconds when asked to sleep for 29.1  29.9 seconds.

Negative 3829 pOk, Im at my wits end with this.  I need to write a server and client that can be run on different machines connected to the internet not on the same networkrouter.  Ive tried RMI, RMIIIOP, EJBGlassFish, CORBA and nothing I do works over the internet.  I must have followed 30 tutorials, examples and guides, but they are all designed to be run on a single machine which doesnt work when attempting to connect remotely from a different computer.p  pAll I want is a hello world type example where the server is launcheddeployed from computer 1 and the client is run on computer 2 and they can exchange simple objects and variables over the internet.  So I can deconstruct it and see what Im doing wrong.p  pPlease, please, please can someone point me in the direction of a tutorial or just code that specifically communicates over the internet.p  pIve been all over Oracle, netbeans, coderanch, stackoverflow and found nothing that has helped.p  pIm using NetBeans 8.0.2 with GlassFish 4.1 on Windows 7 both computersp  pstrongEDIT  to clarify question.strongp  pI have written a program that works in a similar way to Teamviewer where I can monitor the screens of multiple computers on the same network and if needed interact with those computers.  My software essentially grabs screenshots and transmits them as byte arrays as well as sending various simple data objects containing screen, system, mouse and keyboard information.  This works fine with RMI but I want to expand it to be able to support computers who are not on the same network, so via the internet.  I have read here RMI is not suitable and my testing has confirmed that.  So my next logical step was to EJB or RMIIIOP but I simply cannot get those to work over the network let alone over the internet.  So Im really asking here for some help to understand what Im doing wrong, hence the hello world over the internet request.  I have very little experience with this and every example is always local, so I need to bridge the gap from local to internet.  I think part of my misunderstanding was that I thought Glassfish exposed my server experiments to the internet and not just locally.  As you can see, I have some gaps in my knowledge that I was hoping you may be able to help me fill.p

Negative 3829 pIve a project to add persistent routes on a list of servers which I need to do through Powershell. Our environment has 2 NICs for every server , one production one backup. For this I need to fetch the Backup IP address of the computer , replace the last octet by 1 and use it in the route add command.

Negative 3829 pI have an application in java, it connects to a database and write some reports. I want to write those reports at an specific hour every day. First I was going to use the task scheduler from windows server, but apparently it has problems executing my jar. So I though I could use a Thread in java and execute the part of my code that makes the reports as I said at an specific hour every day. This means I have to let my application running all the time, it doesnt feel right, but is my only option for the moment. p  pstrongThe problem here is thisstrongp  pWhen I run my program, it wait till its time to call the class that will create my reports, the problem is that at first the memory consumed by java is 11 000 KB for instance, when it executes the reports part the memory reaches almost 10 000 KB this is reasonable I think, because Im connecting to a database and writing files,etc., then when its time to write those reports again, it will get to 120 000 KB, and the next time 130 000 KB, it doesnt goes higher, but I want to know if theres a way to return to 11 000 KB once I executed the part of the reports. I read about calling the garbage collection but it doesnt work, neither does setting to null my objects.  Do you guys have any idea about why does this happenp  pThank youp

Negative 3829 pI am using subprocces.Popen to run linux commands in python. I am trying to use this command to ssh into a different machine, and see whether it prompts me for a password. p  pHowever, I have no idea how to grab the resulting prompt and use it in the python script. p  pFor example, if I use subprocess.Popen to call the command echo Hello World I can then use the communicate method to grab the resulting stdout from running that command.p  pBut here is what I am trying to do use Popen to run ssh hostname echo Hello  and then grab the result of that for use within the python script. So if the ssh runs into a prompt for the password, I want to be able to have the output of that prompt in the python script to use as a string. Finally, I want to be able to exit out of this prompt equivalent of typing C when using linux terminal. However, when using Popen and communicate, it simply just shows the prompt on the actual linux stdout and doesnt grab the prompt.p  pI was also hoping to suppress this prompt from ever showing on the actual linux terminal stdout.p  pHere is the code that I have been using this code works when grabbing normal stdoutp  precodep  subprocess.Popen[ssh, hostName, echo Hello], stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.PIPE sshOutput, err  p.communicate codepre  pOf course, the password prompt is not stored in sshOutput, which is the issue.

Negative 3829 pI am trying to make an app that uses 3D physics and detects when the various nodes in the scene have all come to rest. The logical way to do this would seem to be testing their isResting property on their physics body. However, no matter how stationary the objects are, this value is never set. I have checked that allowsResting is true and am testing the attribute as follows, but I have never seen even one object at rest despite logging out its status on each update. Ive also tried putting this in the didRender function.

Negative 3829 pMy ionic app has a timera simple setInterval that ticks every second which works perfectly fine when the app is in the foreground. However when the app goes to the background and comes back to the foreground after 10 minutes, the time displayed in the app is wrong the time is much less that it should be. I have tried adding the timer into a directive and also using the native DOM manipulation apidocument.getElementById, etc methods, but they both didnt work. I think the ionic framework is doing something to the view and bindings when the app goes to the background. Has anyone experience such a issue and if so how did you guys manage to fix itp

Negative 3829 pThis code is some basic code to set up tabs in Android.p  precodefinal ActionBar actionBar  getActionBar actionBar.setNavigationModeActionBar.NAVIGATIONMODETABS codepre  pIf you write this code in a project where targetSDK lt 20 or compileSDK lt 20 I dont know what the difference is between versions of compileSDK and targetSDK then it is fine.p  pHowever, if you have compileSDK higher, e.g. 23, then Android Studio will tell you that the code above is deprecated and moreover is removed from SDK, I guess. p  pAnd it will crash my app if i run it on device btw on Android level 20, though the target of project was set to 23 and compiled version too 23, so it crashes because it is deprecated and removed from SDK level 23.p  pQuestionsp  blockquote   p1 What happens if I compile my project with compileSDK version and    targetSDK version set to 20 where there is no problem with being   deprecated and   try run it on Android with SDK 21 or 23 where these    functions are obviously removed from SDK Will the app crash or work p      p2 What happens if I decide to target the high SDK e.g.  23 That   is, I will leave the old code mentioned above and will use some    new code for tabs, which appeared in SDK 23 or so which  didnt   exist in lower SDK then I will try to run the application on    Android with lower SDK, e.g. 20. Will the app crash or workp blockquote  pstrongeditstrongp  pBtw now i launched project with targetSDK and compileSDK 20 on Android with level 22 and it worked.p  pSo it seems the only thing that really matters is the compileSDK version Doesnt even matter on the SDK version of device but it really matters the compileSDKp  pBecause as i said about the two tests  project with bad HIGH SDK launched on device with good LOW SDK  crash. Project with good LOW SDK launched on devide with bad HIGH SDK  not crash.p  pBut the logic of course say that it must also matter on android version of device eg to access some new functions.. or really only matter on compiledSDK or at least from view of backwardsfunctionallityp  pNeed some opinions of experts on this.p
