Positive 644 pI am planning on creating a small website with JavaEE where a user can vote but only every 5 minutes. There are two buttons. One to vote yes and the other to vote no. I want the buttons to only be clickable every 5 minutes. Whats the best way to do thisp  pI thought of getting the users IP and entering it into my DB along with the timestamp. Everytime a user would vote I would get their IP from the DB and check if 5 mins have passed since their last vote. What do you think of this solution Is this best practisep  pI am trying to avoid a login or any other sort of authentication. I plan on using JSF, Java, mySQL and AJAX.p
Positive 644 pI am using an updatePanel in ASP.NET, and on the same page there is a radio group.  I am using javascript code which accesses the name attribute of the radio input fields.  Then it makes a new element with an ID  to the name of the radio input field.  To make the UpdatePanel work, I removed codeltxhtmlconformancemodelegacygtcodep  pBefore I did that, the name rendered for a radio button by asp would look like strongMyControlCountrystrong, which can be used inside a selector string by jQuery as well.  But after removing, it looks like this  strongMyControlCountrystrong, which throws an exception like  strongSyntax error, unrecognized expressionstrongp  pIs there any way I can remove the xhtmlconformancemode entry from my web.config, yet keep the old control naming schemep

Positive 644 ptldr How do you include a file in the DOCTYPE declaration of an XHTML file The solution from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma65091031016716this answera doesnt work, giving different types of errors in the different browsers.p  hr  pLonger versionbr I am interested in defining character entities for XHTML files. One disadvantage of XHTML5 is that you cant use entity references such as codeampnbspcode and codeampeacutecode, only the five basic XML ones.p  pReverting to the XHTML 1 DOCTYPE would work since the XHTML DTD contains definitions for all the entities but then the validator complains about all the new XHTML5 features in the file.p  pReverting the file type to codetexthtmlcode would also work, but then it wouldnt be XHTML any more Defining new entities doesnt work in HTML, only in XHTML.p  pSo the solution is to actively add all the entity names to the DOCTYPE declaration.p  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltDOCTYPE html    [       ltENTITY nbsp   amp160gt       ltENTITY eacute amp233gt    ] gt codepre  pThis works great But including hundreds of entities this way would not be very efficient.

Negative 644 pWhats the best way to handle Boolean values that derive from a UISwitch setting, and are stored in an NSMutableDictionary that is saved to the users directory as persistent settings Specifically, whats the best way to keep boolean values distinct from numeric values in an NSMutableDictionary that gets written to and read from the file systemp  pp  padded Thanks to Adrian and Ben. So, the upshot is that if stored via [NSNumber numberWithBool] this is what I have been doing there is no convenient way to determine if that value originated as a boolean value, correct p  pThe second part of this is that the NSMutableDictionary that Im storing is originally created by creating it via a plist that has Boolean values. These values have the class NSCFBoolean when first read in. Right now my strategy is to compare the value Im working with in the dictionary with the corresponding entry in the plist.p  pThe reason this matters is that Im generating interface elements on the fly to allow the user to manipulate these values, and Im associating booleans with a UISwitch. If I lose the original class by converting to a number, I get an inappropriate user interface element.p  pIm considering substituting arrays as the stored value, where the first value is the stored value, and the remaining entries are the choices where two choices exist, it is treated as a boolean... in other cases, they serve as picker values. But this seems cumbersome, if reliable.p  pAny ideas welcome...p

Negative 644 pI have a page with a few hidden fields in it. Those get filled with values by a script JSjQuery when the user has finished selecting a couple of options.p  pNow, if I click a link on that page, go to the linked page and then hit the backbutton, FF and Safari are able to read out the values of the hidden fields. So the function to read out the values seems to be correct its not complicated anyway.p  pBut IE and also Opera, even though I set history.navigationMode to compatible shows me empty values, even though I can see the correct values in the generated sourcecode of IE.p  pI also added a test function, to show me the values onunload, which worked fine. But hitting the backbutton IE still doesnt recognize them.p  pI have no idea what the problem here is. Anyonep  pThanksp
Negative 644 pThe problem is simpler than codeknapsackcode or a type of it, without values and only positive weights. The problem consists of checking whether a number can be a combination of others.

Negative 644 pYeah, so this one through me or a loop for a while until I figured out what was going on.  With Apple releasing the final version of Xcode today, and iOS 4 coming out yesterday, I finally started to look into porting my apps to iOS 4.p  pSo I downloaded the new SDK, and got to work.

What is the difference between SDK 4 and 3 that would cause a Bad Exc Error  Any ideas  Or perhaps its an issue with cocos2d and that needs to be updatedp  pstrongEditstrong  I did some messing around and found that by removing this line of codep  precode BOOLccTouchBeganUITouch touch withEventUIEvent event      CGPoint touchPoint  [touch locationInView[touch view]]     touchPoint  [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGLtouchPoint]     if  [super containsTouchLocationtouch]  return NO     [self.engine playerHitRedDotself]     [self.parent removeChildself cleanupYES] REMOVED THIS LINE     return YES  codepre  pThen it works.

Negative 644 pNot sure if this is the best approach but I have some string which represents the orientation of some blocks. For example 3V6V means a row of 3 vertical blocks, and a row of 6 vertical blocks. 3V6V6V means row of 3, 6, 6 all vertical. 4H4H4H4H would be 4 rows of 4 horizontal blocks. i.e. every 2 characters constitutes a row. Each item will either have just horizontals or just verticals, no mix and match. What I need to do here is add the total of the digits to determine the total number of blocks. How can I do that I was thinking do some kind of string.split and then if an array item is a number, add it to a running total. Is there a better approach to this 4H4H4H4H would be 16 and 3V6V6V would be 15. Can someone point me in the right direction There must be a fairly easy way to do this.p  pThanks,br ck in San Diegop

Let me put forth what I DO know to save everyone some time.p  p1 When you create an IBOutlet, your view controller automatically retains this outlet.p  p1a When you dont create an outlet, the frameworkthe nib releases your objectslike uilabels or uiviews for you.p  p2 When you do self.myOutlet  nil, you effectively release an outletproviding that you have synthesized your properties correctly. This is because the setter releases the outlet and assigns it to nil.p  pWhat I dont knowp  p1 The MAIN question If you do self.myOutlet  nil in viewDidUnLoad, do you still need to do anything in dealloc Can you make the assumption that viewDidUnload always called before deallocand therefore your retained views are releasedp  p2 If you dont synthesize a property for that outlet, what happens Shouldnt the framework release it automaticallysince you dont have a retain property If you do have to release it, how do you do it and wherein viewDidUnload or deallocp  pIf anything is wrong, please point it out to me. Any clarifications at all would be very helpful.p

Negative 644 pI have a View with one codeUITextViewcode in the top half, one codeUIImageViewcode on the bottom half and a button in the middle, between them. What Im trying to do is every time I press the button, the codeUITextViewcode must change the text it gets it from a codesqlitecode db. I managed to do that, but now I want to animate the text change. So I want the codeUITextFieldcode to fade out to the left, then fade in from the right with a the new text inside.p  pNow i followed the ViewTransition documentation and created a second codeUITextViewcode so I can animate between them. The only problem is that animation happens to the entire view. So even the image and the button slides in every time. I just want to animate the text views. How would i go about doing that p

Negative 644 pSo far Ive implemented a gaussian blur filter entirely in the space domain, making use of the separability of the gaussian, that is, applying a 1D gaussian kernel along the rows and then along the columns of an image. That worked fine.p  pNow, given only with the size N of the NxN convolution matrix of the space domain, I want to achieve the exact same blurred image over the frequency domain. That means that Ill load the image into a matrix numpy, Im using python, apply the FFT on it then I have Gx,y, and then I have to have also a filter Hu,v in the frequency domain that also resembles the shape of some 2d gaussian, with its center value being 1.0 and then having values falling off to 0 the further away from the center I am. I do then the multiplication in frequency domain before I have to consider to do a centershift of H and then apply the iFFT.p  pThe trouble I have is to find the exact formula i.e. to find sigma, the stddeviation that will result in the corresponding Hu,v. From the space domain, if I have been given a masksize N, I know that the stddev sigma can be approximated as sigmamaskSize122.575, e.g. for a mask size N15 I get stddev2.71845 for ex2sigma, just considering 1D cases for now.p  pBut how do I get sigma for the frequency domainp  pFunny thing is btw that in theory I know how to get sigma, using Mathematica, but the result is pure bogus, as I can demonstrate herep  precodegauss1d[x, sigma]  Exp[x22 sigma2] Simplify[FourierTransform[gauss1d[x, sigma], x, omega], sigma gt 0] codepre  pThe result is E12 omega2 sigma2  sigmap  pThis is bogus because it turns, in the exponent of the E function, the 1sigma into a sigma. Consequently, if you draw this, you will see that the standard deviation has become a lot smaller, since the Hu,vgaussian is a lot thinner. However, it should actually be a lot wider in the frequency domain than in the space domain It doesnt make any sense...p

Negative 644 pI have read what I believe to be the relevant parts of the Quartz 2D Programming Guide, but cannot find an answer to the following they dont seem to talk a lot about iOS in the documentp  pMy application displays a drawing in a codeUIViewcode. Every now and then I have to update the drawing in some way, e.g. change the fill colour of one of the shapes I keep codeCGPathRefscode to the important shapes to be able to redraw them with a different fill colour later. As described in the Section Drawing With a CGLayer on page 169 of the aforementioned document, I was thinking of drawing the entire drawing into a codeCGContextcode that I would obtain from a codeCGLayercode, like sop  precodeCGContextRef offscreenContext  CGLayerGetContextoffscreenLayer codepre  pThen I could do my updating offscreen into the codeCGContextcode and draw the codeCGLayercode into my UIView in the codeUIViewcodes drawRect method, like sop  precodeCGContextDrawLayerAtPointviewContext, CGPointZero, offscreenLayer codepre  pThe problem I am having is, where do I get my codeCGLayercode from My understanding is I have to make it using codeCGLayerCreateWithContextcode and supply a codeCGContextcode as a parameter from which it inherits most of its properties. Obviously, the right context would be the context of the codeUIViewcode, that I am getting with p  precodeCGContextRef viewContext  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext codepre  pbut if I am not mistaken, I can only get that within the codedrawRectcode method and it is not valid to assume that the context I am given there will be the same one next time the method is called, i.e. I can only use that codeCGContextcode locally within the method.p  pSo, how can I get a codeCGContextcode that I can use to initialise my codeCGLayercode to create an offscreen codeCGContextcode to draw into and then draw the entire layer back into my codeUIViewcodes codeCGContextcodep  pPS While youre at it if anything above does not make sense or is not sane, please let me know. I am just starting to get my head around Quartz 2D.p
Negative 644 pIm currently creating an iOS app that uploads files to a server. As multiple uploads can be queued and have metadata attached that I want to store persistently, Im using Core Data to model and store uploads. Im also using codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to display all uploads in a table view. So far so good.p  pIm now implementing a progress indicator and thats where Im unsure if my implementation is really a good idea. Ive added a codefloatcode property to my model which gets updated by my upload controller as the upload progresses. Im then updating my codeUITableViewCellcode subclass with the help of codeNSFetchedResultsControllerDelegatecode and this works pretty well. However, it doesnt really make sense to actually strongstorestrong this property persistently, since uploads cant be resumed if the app gets terminated. Im only using the property to connect my upload controller and view controller. Is there a better way to do this without losing the convenience of codeNSFetchedResultsControllercodep

Negative 644 pI am learning about a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiProgressiveenhancementProgressive Enhancementa and I have a question about AJAXifying views. In my MVC 3 project I have a layout page, a viewstart page, and two plain views.p  pThe viewstart page is in the root of the Views folder and thus applies to all views. It specifies that all views should use codeLayout.cshtmlcode for their layout page. The layout page contains two navigation links, one for each view. The links use codeHtml.ActionLinkcode to render themselves to the page.p  pNow I have added jQuery and want to hijack these links and use Ajax to load their content on the page dynamically.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function           theLink.clickfunction               .ajax                 url this.attrhref,                 type GET,                 success function response                      mainContent.htmlresponse                                           return false               ltscriptgt codepre  pThere are two ways I can think of to do this, but I dont particularly like either onep  p1 I can take the entire Views contents and place them in a partial view, then have the main view call the partial view when it is rendered. That way, using codeRequest.IsAjaxRequestcode in the controller, I can return codeViewcode or return codePartialViewcode based on whether or not the request is an Ajax request. I cant return the regular view to the Ajax request because then it would use the layout page and Id get a second copy of the layout page injected. However, I dont like this because it forces me to create empty views with just a codeHtml.RenderPartialcode in them for the standard GET requests.p  precode    public ActionResult Index              if Request.IsAjaxRequest             return PartialViewpartialView         else             return View      codepre  pThen in Index.cshtml do thisp  precodeHtml.RenderPartialpartialView codepre  p2 I can remove the layout designation from viewstart and specify it manually when the request is NOT Ajaxp  precode    public ActionResult Index              if Request.IsAjaxRequest             return View  Return view with no master.         else             return ViewIndex, Layout  Return view with master.      codepre  pDoes anyone have a better suggestion Is there a way to return a view without its layout page It would be much easier to explicitly say dont include your layout if it is an ajax request, than it would be to explicitly include the layout if its not an ajax.p

I am using codefbme[id]code to retrieve the id of the facebook user so that i could use it retrieve the players information from the database to initialize the game  so called load from previous saved game progess.p  pFor the save game to work, my idea is to store the facebook users id, fbme[id] as a codeSESSIONcode variable or codeGLOBALScode variable, so that when the .swf game loads, it will in turn load initializeplayerstats.php which will load players information from the database. the initializeplayerstats.php is suppose to retrieve the stored variable, either codeSESSIONcodeor codeGLOBALScode and matches the id with the database and return results accordingly. but somehow, the variables dosent seem to be retrieved and hence could not load any data from the database.p  pIn my fbmain.phpp  precodeltphp  fbconfig[appid]  XXX fbconfig[api]  XXX fbconfig[secret]  XXX  try      includeonce facebook.php  catch Exception o      echo ltpregt     printro     echo ltpregt   Create our Application instance. facebook  new Facebookarray             appId gt fbconfig[appid],             secret gt fbconfig[secret],             cookie gt true,           session  facebookgtgetSession loginUrl  facebookgtgetLoginUrl                 array                     canvas gt 1,                     fbconnect gt 0,                     reqperms gt email,publishstream,statusupdate,userbirthday, userlocation,userworkhistory                    fbme  null if session      echo ltscript typetextjavascriptgttop.location.href  loginUrlltscriptgt     exit  else      try          uid  facebookgtgetUser         fbme  facebookgtapime      catch FacebookApiException e          echo ltscript typetextjavascriptgttop.location.href  loginUrlltscriptgt         exit         Session based graph API call. if session      try          uid  facebookgtgetUser         fbme  facebookgtapime      catch FacebookApiException e          de        function dd      echo ltpregt     printrd     echo ltpregt   gt codepre  pAnd in my index.php codes summarized to make reading neaterp  precodeltphp sessionstart includeonce fbmain.php config[baseurl]  httpwww.xxx.comxxxdevelopmentindex.php   method 1, tried to use session variable.. not working.

Negative 644 pI was building out a little project that made use of HTML localStorage. While I was nowhere close to the 5MB limit for localStorage, I decided to do a stress test anyway. p  pEssentially, I loaded up data objects into a single localStorage Object until it was just slightly under that limit and must requests to set and get various items. p  pI then timed the execution of setItem and getItem informally a hrefhttpejohn.orgblogaccuracyofjavascripttimeusing the javascript Date objecta and event handlers bound get and set to buttons in HTML and just clicked Pp  pThe performance was horrendous, with requests taking between 600ms to 5,000ms, and memory usage coming close to 200mb in the worser of the cases. This was in Google Chrome with a single extension Google Speed Tracer, on MacOSX.p  pIn Safari, its basically 4,000ms all the time.p  pFirefox was a surprise, having pretty much nothing over 150ms. p  pThese were all done with basically an idle state  No YouTube Flash getting in the way, not many tabs nothing but Gmail, and with no applications open other than background process  the Browser. Once a memoryintensive task popped up, localStorage slowed down proportionately as well. FWIW, Im running a late 2008 Mac  2.0Ghz Duo Core with 2GB DDR3 RAM.p  pp  pSo the questions p  ol liHas anyone done a benchmarking of sorts against localStorage get and set for various different key and value sizes, and on different browsersli liIm assuming the large variance in latency and memory usage between Firefox and the rest is a Gecko vs Webkit Issue. I know that the answer can be found by diving into those code bases, but Id definitely like to know if anyone else can explain relevant details about the implementation of localStorage on these two engines to explain the massive difference in efficiency and latency across browsersli ol  pUnfortunately, I doubt well be able to get to solving it, but the closer one can get is at least understanding the limitations of the browser in its current state. p  pThanksp

Negative 644 pIve created a unit test suite for a project Im working on. My unit tests used to run very quickly... 200 of them would run within a few seconds. Typically each test would take less than 10 milliseconds. Now while using Valgrind and Gcov each test can take over 1.5 minutes to run Has anyone had any experience with very slow unit tests Does Valgrind, gcov, or Google Test cause significant slowdown of program execution in any particular situations Whats even more confusing is that some of the unit test run just fine i.e. very quickly while others take many seconds to run. And often, when running the unit tests again, the same tests take a different amount of time to run. Im basically trying to figure out where the bottleneck is.

Negative 644 pIm building a generic survey engine where end users can generate and design their own surveys including UI design. Im interested in building or perhaps even buying a custom WinForms designer which would be able to output design in XML format. Id then save the XML to database and when users load a survey, XML would be parsed and the form would be dynamically generated based on the XML data. Building my own C to XML converter is an option, but Id like to avoid it since users would have to use Visual Studio to get ahold of WinForms code and then run a custom tool to generate XML output, which is a pretty clumsy solution besides I cant force customers to buy VS.p  pId appreciate it if anyone could point me in the right direction.p  pThanksp
Negative 644 pI would like to know if its possible to force the camera to send video in landscape mode width  heightp  pLets say that we have a little app for android which send the image captured from the camera using SIP. What is happening is that the size of the video depends on how you have your mobile. If you have your mobile vertially the camera captures a portraitsize video, and if you have your mobile horizontally the camera caputres a landscapesize video. I guess this is because of the Camera.Preferences, it makes the size of the surface based on the camera real sizes.p  pWhat I want is to have the mobile in portrait mode, but I want to show the video in landscape format, of course it will be resized to fit in the screen as your screen is on portrait mode. Is there any way to do thatp  pI think of some possibilities and maybe to force the camera to record in landscape mode, even if the phone is in portrait mode. I dont know if this is possible.p  pI think of making a bridge which resizes the video and show it like a landscape video it was. This option should be more complicated.p  pI dont know for sure a lof of code that you have to make, just if anyone has a reference link or some code that resizes video in the way I am looking for, or the Classes that I have to use to do it. I really have been looking for information and didnt really find anything that helps me. Any help is really appreciated.p

Negative 644 pI am redesigning a few databases into one encompassing database, and I have noticed the previous designers of the old databases like to store categories in their own tables. For example, say that there is a table boatsbid integer, bname string, color integer, and in the application there is a dropdown box allowing the user to specify the colour of the boat, then there is a table colorcid integer, cname string. I would have not included the color table, and just put the colours as strings in the boats table. I realize that this decreases redundant storage of colour names, but is the added runtime cost of joining the boat table with the colour table worth it Also the dropdowns are populated with SELECT cname FROM color statements, while I would have defined a view on SELECT DISTINCT color FROM boats to populate the dropdowns.p  pThe example is simple, but this happens multiple times in the system I am redesigning, even for categories with only two options. This has resulted in many tables with only 2 fields. Some only have 1 field I havent figured out what those are for yet, but I think they are only to populate the dropdowns, and the actual tables contain the values as well.p

Negative 644 pWhat Id like to do is iterate through a navigations list items, and fade each element in, sequentially, but with the flexibility of having two delay options the option to wait for each previous animation to complete before proceeding with the next animation, andor a custom delaytimeout milliseconds between the start of each animation not a delay between the end of one animation and the start of the next animation.p  pNaturally, I could use nested callbacks and call each list item specifically, but thats rather inefficient codewise, and would only load each element oneafteranother, which is okay in some cases, but in others I might want to have them load nearly simultaneously, with a possible slight delay to emulate some of the Flash based navigations Ive seen. Hense why I say that the custom delay option should be between the start of one, and the start of the next.p  pFor what its worth, the navigation elements are first being hidden via codenav li.hidecode but I suspect you already guessed that might be the case. p  pHow might this sort of effect be accomplishedp

Negative 644 pThis is really a general question.p  pI have an ecommerce webapp that I built solo about 4 years ago.  At the time, I made the decision to use Struts as my mvc framework.  As years passed working on other projects, I came to appreciate and feel much more comfortable with the feature set and flexibility offered by Spring MVC.p  pThe service layer is solid, and is built using the spring framework.p  pId like to refactor my current web layer to now use Spring MVC.  But as I have mentioned previously, I wrote the app solo and its more of a side project.  The point being that I do not have time, nor do I want to risk throwing away and completely reengineering the web layer from scratch. p  pSo Im asking the community on what their strategy would be for this refactoring effortp  pIdeally, I would like to tackle pieces at a time, and ultimately mix the two technologies until eventually when I can completely turn off Struts.p  pAll new functionality for my site would best be developed in Spring MVC.p  pThe good thing is that my existing views, which is currently using apache tiles, would not have to change much, with the exception of removing struts tag libraries and replacing them with Spring MVC.p  pOne requirement Id like to keep is that the URLs should not change.p  pIn other words, the ActionServlet and the DispatcherServlet would have to map to separate paths but somehow go to different implementations.p  pFor example, how can I say that mysite.comshowproduct maps to a Spring Dispatcher servlet, but mysite.comshowcategory maps to a Struts action servlet.p  pYour thoughts are appreciated.p

Negative 644 pShot in the dark but I thought Id try to post in hopes of some genius out there...p  pstrongBackgroundstrong I am trying to added automated unit testing to a huge unmanaged C project.  For various reasons within our group, we want to use MSTest.  As a result, classes and functions from an unmanged MFC C project need to be called from a managed C project.p  pstrongProof of Feasabilitystrong I have accomplished this on a small scale to prove that it does, in fact, work.  This is what I didp  ol liCreate an unmanaged MFC C project SOURCE with few classes and functions compile as a static library .libli liCreate a managed C project WRAPPER that links to the aforementioned static library.  Each wrapper class simply creates a pointer to an object of the corresponding class in the SOURCE and calls each of its functions, just like one would expect a wrapper class to do.  Compile as a dynamic library .dll.li liCreate a C project CSHARP.  Add a reference to the WRAPPER dll.  Now you can call the WRAPPER function directly which, in turn, call the unmanaged SOURCE functions.li ol  pThis works.  I can share the example project if you want to see it.  The next step was taking the concept and getting to work with our gigantic, highly coupled codebase.p  pstrongWhere Im at nowstrong Long story short, I have the WRAPPER project building successfully and creating a DLL.

Negative 644 pI have been trying to find an answer to this vital question for a few months but to no avail. So I am posting it here since stackoverflow is the best place for technical questions.p  pI made an Android app, name of which Ill not mention at this stage. It syncs with a central MySQL database via a webservice on LAMP, which also I created. It all works just great, no problems whatsoever. As the users use the app and perform certain actions, data from their devices gets uploaded to this central server which is running in a data center. As other mobile devices syncs with the database, they get updated with the newer data. At the initial install, app gets a few hundred K of data downloaded via few hundred queries.p  pNow the problem is that the app has started to get so many downloads that I can foresee Ill not be able to keep up with the sync. For a while I have been optimizing the code both on the Android end and on Web end with iPhone version still under development, and also using caching techniques, but still, the communication between thousands of mobiles devices and one single database is reaching its limits. Everyday the number of downloads are more than previous day. Now I am extremely worried how to handle this situation.p  pI have been looking into using Amazon DynamoDB, have also went over its SDK, tutorials, etc. and am ready to spend a few days and switch this whole sync thingy to Amazon. But this will eventually cost me heavily, for which Ill have to charge for the app or use a better advertisement scheme. But thats another issue.p  pUnfortunately Googling for weeks hasnt helped me on figuring out how to efficiently handle large syncs with thousands of mobile devices, which might get into tens of thousands or probably hundreds of thousands.p  pIn short, what to do to, lets say, deal with 100K devices using my app and in need of keeping in sync with a central databasep  pKindly answer if you have faced a similar situation and know how to deal with it in real life.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 644 pWhy are people using Spring DI vs. JSR330 DI  I see many projects still going forward at a huge speed with spring DI oblivious to the JSR330 specification.  Many dont even know it exists.  Was it not marketed enough and spring wasp  pI do see posts of Guice vs. spring, but the real argument should be JSR330 vs. spring since spring does not implement the spec yetand hopefully one day it will.  Any ideas on why such a large portion of the community seems oblivious to JSR330 and not evolving to itp  pNOTE I should make a correction here.  Spring 3.0 does implement JSR330 and even has a way to override the default bindings much like guice except you have to supply an xml file instead of a Module file written in java.  p

Negative 644 pI have a requirement to nest enums in Java.

For examplep  precodeEvent.Draw.Square Event.Draw.Circle Event.Draw.Triangle Event.Draw.Poly Event.Draw.Line  Event.File.Load Event.File.Save  Event.Screen.Zoom Event.Screen.Flip  Event.Ui.New Event.Ui.Close codepre  pHow I would envisage this in code would be the following, but obviously its not right. Any pointers please on how to obtain this with enumsp  precodeprivate enum event      Draw Square, Circle, Triangle, Poly, Line,     File Save, SaveAs, Load,     Screen Zoom, Flip, RotateCW, RotateCCW,     Ui NewWorkspace, Close     codepre  pThen I would like for a case statement or conditional structure to be able to act upon say Event.Screen, or Event.Screen.Zoom. See the following methods for examplep  precodepublic void evenTriggeredEvent event      switch event          case Event.Draw             drawEventevent.Draw     case Event.UI             uiEventevent.Ui     case Event.Screen             screenEventevent.Screen     case Event.File             fileEventevent.File     default do nothing      end switch end eventTriggered   public void drawEventEvent.Draw event       switchevent.draw          case Event.Draw.Square             workspace.addSquare         break     case Event.Draw.Circle             workspace.addCircle          break       case Event.Draw.Triange         workspace.addTriangle          break      default do nothing      end switch  end drawEvent codepre  pThanks for taking the time to read my post and I look forward to your suggestions.p  pAndrew.p
Negative 644 pI have two classes this is C that are very similar except they each contain their own nested class and enum.p  pI would like to refactor them to both inherit from a single abstract class, but Im running into a problem because the methods are all tightly coupled to the nested class types.p  pMy first plan was to pull out the ItemDetails Class, but it is linked to the ItemType, which is an enum that is specific to each view item class.

Negative 644 pBy the amount is unknown I mean that at the time of creation of whatever data structure I use to store them in, I dont know how many objects there will end up being to store.

Im wondering what would be the most efficient in time and space, but mostly time way to go about doing this in java. p  pI emdoem have a cap on the max number of objects that there will be in the thing, so I was considering just making an array of this size. But I didnt want to waste space, and the array could end up being more than twice as big as the number of elements that actually get stored in it. p  pI was also considering a LinkedList, because I thought maybe it would be more efficient to iterate through it than having to create an iterator from something else like a hashmap and iterate through that.

Negative 644 pLets say a user wants to delete a post and you want to perform this asynchronously, youd probably do something like...p  precode.posthttpsmysite.comexecsremove.phpamppostid  post codepre  pOr you wouldnt, because you dont want someone to be able to just copy that link with the users post id and trick them into deleting it. So instead I do this...p  precode.posthttpsmysite.comremove.phppostid  post  ampvisitsession  visitsession codepre  pI plugin their secret visit session id which is called via ajax earlier in the script and changes every time they login. So unless a user can guess their random id the link will fail and the user will be safe...p  pThen I wondered whats stopping someone from creating a webpage to steal this users visit session id Couldnt a malicious person essentially just copy and paste my ajax request in their own site and do something like this...p  precode.ajax type GET,   url httpsmysite.comvisitsession.php,   dataType json,    success functiondata      window.location  httpsmysite.comremove.phppostidPOSTIDampvisitsession  data.visitsession   codepre  pSo if a user set up a site with that little script in it, and then linked it to the user they wanted to trick into deleting their post, wouldnt it do just that Assuming the user is currently logged into my site.p  pAssuming Im right in my thinking here, what can I do to prevent this from happeningp  pEDIT Instead of polling the visit session variable inside my javascript file I know I could just do something like...p  precodeltscriptgt visitsession  ltphp echo SESSION[visit] gt ltscriptgt ltscript srchttpsmysite.comjavascriptmain.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pThis would prevent a malicious user from polling it on behalf of another user.

Negative 644 pI will try to describe the problem as best as I can. I have a GUI designed in C CLI Visual Studio 2010 with some OpenGL.p  pI have a loop, this is what gets done or should get done 1. Read line from a file, parse it into parts 2. Call a wait function for a certain period of time  no action to be taken during this period but GUI should be usable  emergency stop buttons, etc 3. Once time elapses, go back to reading line from file.p  pI could definitely do this on the microcontroller side in C using interrupts, but I dont know how to achieve the same thing here. My original idea was to start timer, when the event handler for elapsed time fires, call a function that would in turn call the reading function again. But I dont think that would work well, as at the end of reading the entire file, all those functions will return to their callers. This could also be a mess because file can technically have infinite number of lines run out of memory with all these calls. What I mean here is basically a huge loop of recursive functions best I can describe them, where A will call B, but B will call A, after which A calls B again.p  pI have found this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions181643waitwindowinawindowsapplicationWait window in a windows applicationa with the suggestion about using a delegate, but C doesnt accept anonymous delegates. I also dont know if this does what I want. Where will the following code snippet return to after time elapses I know this is for C, but the idea should be the same, rightp  precodeTimer t  new Timer t.Interval  2000 t.Tick  delegate  Close t.Stop t.Start codepre  pI have thought about threading, but I dont know how that will solve my problem. I need the wait timer to trigger another instance of file reading, which would involve calling a function, resulting in my endless function calls worry.p  pThere is also this, that I looked at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.timercallback.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.timercallback.aspxa , which uses TimerCallback . But that would suspend the thread until timer fires, right This would mean that the GUI would be unresponsive.p  pWhile unresponsiveness is something I of course want to avoid, I could do it. Or perhaps it is better to put the whole filereadingwaiting block into its own thread and let it delay whatever it wantsp  pId appreciate the advice. p

Negative 644 pIn this article a hrefhttpjava.sun.comproductshotspotwhitepaper.html2 relnofollowhttpjava.sun.comproductshotspotwhitepaper.html2ap  pit is stated thatp  blockquote   pThe JDK includes two flavors of the VM  a clientside offering, and a VM tuned for server applications. These two solutions share the Java HotSpot runtime environment code base, but use different compilers that are suited to the distinctly unique performance characteristics of clients and servers. These differences include the compilation inlining policy and heap defaults.p      pThe JDK contains both of the these systems in the distribution, so developers can choose which system they want by specifying client or server.p      pAlthough the Server and the Client VMs are similar, the Server VM has been specially     tuned to maximize peak operating speed. It is intended for executing longrunning server applications, which need the fastest possible operating speed more than a fast startup time or smaller runtime memory footprint.p      pThe Client VM compiler serves as an upgrade for both the Classic VM and the justintime JIT compilers used by previous versions of the JDK. The Client VM offers improved run time performance for applications and applets. The Java HotSpot Client VM has been specially tuned to reduce application startup time and memory footprint, making it particularly well suited for client environments. In general, the client system is better for GUIs.p blockquote  pDoes this mean that if one wants to run an application with the serverflag, one has to compile with a certain mode to get it to work properlyp

Negative 644 pIs it possible to tell PayPal through the NVP to not send a response to the IPN handler  For instance I use the IPN for payments I receive through a store I have running FoxyCart.  However the store Im setting up now doesnt use a 3rd party cart, Im just using the API response to handle handle everything.  Because of this I dont want PayPal to send a response to the IPN.  p  pIve scoped out the notifyurl param, but that appears to only change where the IPN response is sent to.  p  pI would prefer for this store that no IPN response gets sent at all, while allowing the other store to continue using the IPN it has always been.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 644 pI have a system that has a materialized view that contains roughly 1 billion items, on a consistent two hour basis I need to update about 200 million 20 of the records.

I am curious as to the performance impacts between refreshing on an interval vice refresh never and renamereplace the old materialized view with the new one.

Negative 644 pI need a PHP function that can assert that two arrays are the same while ignoring the values of a specified set of keys only the value, the keys must match.p  pIn practice, the arrays must have the same structure, but some values can be ignored.p  pFor example, considering the following two arraysp  precodeArray      [0] gt Array                      [id] gt 0             [title] gt Book1 Title             [creationDate] gt 20130113 170107             [pageCount] gt 0            Array      [0] gt Array                      [id] gt 1             [title] gt Book1 Title             [creationDate] gt 20130113 170107             [pageCount] gt 0           codepre  pthey are the same if we ignore the value of the key codeidcode. p  pI also want to consider the possibility of nested arraysp  precodeArray      [0] gt Array                      [id] gt 0             [title] gt Book1 Title             [creationDate] gt 20130113 170107             [pageCount] gt 0               [1] gt Array                      [id] gt 0             [title] gt Book2 Title             [creationDate] gt 20130113 180107             [pageCount] gt 0            Array      [0] gt Array                      [id] gt 2             [title] gt Book1 Title             [creationDate] gt 20130113 170107             [pageCount] gt 0               [1] gt Array                      [id] gt 3             [title] gt Book2 Title             [creationDate] gt 20130113 180107             [pageCount] gt 0           codepre  pSince I need it for testing, I have come up with the following class that extends a hrefhttpwww.phpunit.demanual3.8enwritingtestsforphpunit.html relnofollowPHPUnitFrameworkTestCasea and uses its assert functionsp  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeclass MyTestCase extends PHPUnitFrameworkTestCase      public static function assertArraysSameexpected, actual, array ignoreKeys  array              selfdoAssertArraysSameexpected, actual, ignoreKeys, 1           private static function doAssertArraysSameexpected, actual, array ignoreKeys  array, depth, maxDepth  256              selfassertNotEqualsdepth, maxDepth         depth          foreach expected as key gt exp               check they both have this key             selfassertArrayHasKeykey, actual               check nested arrays              if isarrayexp                 selfdoAssertArraysSameexp, actual[key], ignoreKeys, depth               check they have the same value unless the key is in the toignore list             else if arraysearchkey, ignoreKeys  false                 selfassertSameexp, actual[key]               remove the current elements             unsetexpected[key]             unsetactual[key]                    check that the two arrays are both empty now, which means they had the same lenght         selfassertEmptyexpected         selfassertEmptyactual       codepre  pcodedoAssertArraysSamecode iterates through one of the arrays and asserts recursively that the two arrays have the same keys.

Negative 644 pso I have a site already in production using the carrierwave gem with images stored on amazon s3. my uploader uses the codestoredircode method to specify a particular structure to put in processed images. p  pwell, now in my dev environment Ive added the carrierwavedirect gem to start uploading directly to S3. The problem is this gem completely overrides the storedir and filename defaults in my uploader. I cant push my fully working uploader live because all my old image links will be broken.p  pits my understanding that the CWdirect gem would upload a raw image file to a temp directory on S3, then S3 responds and gives you a codekeycode variable so you can grab this file and process it as you see fit. so, should i be using a completely separate image uploader class in carrierwave to process the images and place them in the correct folders meaning Ill have one uploader dedicated to carrierwavedirect that uploads wherever this gem seems to want to upload to and Ill use another uploader.rb class linked to my real model that keeps my current storedir and filename structure p  pIn any case, my basic question is, how can I use CarrierWaveDirect gem if I already have CW running in production with images in a specific folder structure p

When I type spotifyapptest in the search bar, I get something like this p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNmdSX.png althttpimg834.imageshack.usimg8347153spotifyh.pngp  pNote, in the screenshot it says spotifyapptutorial, but I get the exact same result as displayed when I type spotifyapptest, saying failed to load applicationp  pAlso, I use Spotify version 0.8.7.111.gaf8d06ed245p

Negative 644 pI want to deliver dynamically generated Javascript or JSON files in an ASP.NET MVC 4 project in VS 2010.  I do this by returning codePartialViewsomescript.jscode in the action method.  I then create the file codeViewsMyControllersomescript.js.cshtmlcode containing the Javascript.  Im also careful to set the codeResponse.ContentTypecode appropriately.p  pThis seems to work fine from the browser.  However, VS 2010 treats editing codesomescript.js.cshtmlcode as an HTML file, naturally.

Negative 644 pMy ASP.NET MVC web application creates some data on behalf of a user and stores it in a SQL database in a record with a numeric primary key.  I access the data via the primary key.p  pI want my authenticated users to be able to navigate to a URL that contains the numeric primary key, but I dont want to expose the actual key value.  So, it seems to me that I would want to encrypt the numeric key using a symmetrical encryption algorithm with a password consisting of a string baked into my code plus the loggedin users UserID.  The resultant URL would look something like codehttpsfoo.com123abccode, where 123abc is the encrypted key value converted from bytes to characters.  In theory to my beginner brain this encrypted value, even if acquired by a malicious party, would not be useful unless that party could log in to my website using the users credentials.p  pstrongQuestion 1strong Is this the correct way to do this sort of thing, andbr strongQuestion 2strong Can someone who knows this stuff point me at a simple symmetrical encryption API that I can use for this purpose.p

Negative 644 pThe purpose of this question is which programing language would be best suited for accomplishing this and is their a program that could do this for me Often times I have to setup a static IP address, netmask, gateway DNSs and DNS suffixes for Windows that are created as a vm through vsphere. All this information Im typing in is always the same except for the static IP address. Im working with any version of Windows from XP to 8 including server builds. Is there anyway I can simplify or automate part of my task As it is I cant even copy and paste a list of suffixes as Windows makes you input one at a time. Would a language such as Power Shell or using .bat files be helpful Would it be enough exporting the codeHKEYLOCALMACHINESYSTEMControlSet001servicesTcpipParameterscode from a working computer and inserting it to the new builds registryp

Negative 644 pI am storing data in 2 multimaps. The data is a struct the consists of 6 variablesp  precodestruct data      int var     string var     string var     string symbol     int price     int var  codepre  pNow I need to sort the data in the multimaps by codesymbolcode. If the symbols are the same, then go by codepricecode. In one the multimaps I go from codepricecode high to low and viceversa in the other. For example, In codemultimap1code, I have codesymbol1 50code codesymbol1 45code. In codemultimap2code, I have codesymbol2 30code codesymbol2 35code. Because I am sorting by two values, I used a struct as the key for the multimaps. The struct consists of the symbol name and price to sort the data. p  pIf the following question is possible which I dont think is, then I think, the second part of my question does not need to be answered. Is it possible to search throughout the two multimaps using only part of the key. For example, I want to be able to find all of the data with the same symbol, regardless of price, using the codemultimap.equalrangecode or any other method or algorithm to do this. The problem is that the key has two values, and I want to search with only 1 of the 2 values.p  pI dont think this is possible, so I created 2 more multimaps using a string as the symbol to search for the symbol names with codedatacode as the values. Now I can find all the symbols with the same name. The problem I am now facing is that the data in the two multimaps are not linked. What I want is, if I modify the data in codemultimap1searchcode the multimap used for searching, then it also modifies the same data in codemultimap1code, or at least be able to modify the same codedatacode values in both multimaps. Keep in mind that the the data in the 2 multimaps are not in the same order. Is this possible Do you guys recommend using another data structure to this I can only use the C STL. I dont have access to boost or any other libraries. Also, the main focus for this program is efficiency.p  pAlso, in general, how do you modify values in multimaps. Do you remove it and insert another value If you are modifying a lot of values, is there a better data structure to use I am going to be doing a lot, inserting, searching, and modifying and possibly removing.p

Negative 644 pI have a couple of pages with multimedia content flash, and I want to be able to search its contents through an page.p  pSince its content isnt searcheable, and I have a document with all the wordimage descriptions that are going to appear in each page, I was thinking of writing this content in several pages linking them to the respective page with multimedia content,and use a search engine to index this information.p  pBut this looks like overcomplication. So I though of using javascript and insert each pages keyword to its own array, and when the user searches it compares with each array and prints This content is available in the following pagesp  pThis seems simple, but I would like to have some opinions from more experienced people  either  for problems that Im going to run into  or bettereasier solutions.p  pI ask that anyone who contributes consider that Im not that experienced with programming.p

Negative 644 pSuppose you have an object that does some work internally on a private dispatch queue think thread for those not familiar with GCD.  This object notifies its delegate at various times throughout the work its doing.  It is a bad idea to call the delegate methods from the private queue the code is currently running on, or should they be called on a more wellknown queue  If the latter, what queue It seems like main queue may not always be what you want.  p  pstrongOption Astrongp  precodedispatchasyncprivatequeue,       Do some work...

Option B is probably safer, but mainqueue is just an example how should the two really decide on what queue they should usep  pThanksp

Negative 644 pIm using Linq2Sql to return the results of a stored procedure. The sproc provides 100,000 records in under 2 seconds.

Looking at my network traffic seems to confirm that the code is going back out to the database for each object. Setting DeferredLoadingEnabled to false didnt help.p  pThe funny thing is, I thought that a disadvantage of stored procedures was that they dumped all of the data back at you at once, rather than as an IQueryable  p

Negative 644 pAccidentally the same stored procedure was run twice at one time on our MS SQL Server 2008 R2. They were run from the same SQL Server Management Studio client and I tried to cancel them both. After 45 minutes neither process has cancelled. I read somewhere that it would help to close the query windows in SSMS so I did. However the tables the stored procedure should be writing to is still locked even though almost 20 hours has passed. I guess there is a deadlock. I hit cancel seconds after the stored procedure was initiated.p  pThe table the stored procedure is reading from is not locked. The stored procedure is in CLR. It reads from a table, manipulate data and then use SqlBulkCopy to insert into three other tables.p  pThe data in the tables the SP writes to can very easily be recreated. However I can neither drop nor truncate them due to the lock. I also tried KILL SPID with no result.p  pI have been thinking about restarting the server, but I guess it would not help because of SQL Servers data integrity.p  pI would really like some input on how release the lock.

So here is my codep  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions   self.window  [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]]   [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]is it correct to call it here  LoginVC loginObj  [[LoginVC alloc]init]  self.navigationController  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllercellPhoneNumber]  self.tabBarController  [[UITabBarController alloc]init]  self.window.rootViewController  self.tabBarController  [self.tabBarController presentViewControllerself.navigationController animatedNO completion]  return YES  codepre  pI am calling code[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]code on second line right after codeuiwindowcode codealloccode codeinitcode. Is it correct do this or I can experience problems like viewcontroller not receiving events or orientations notifications p

Negative 644 pI am trying to find out the best way to Assert, Should i be creating an object with what i should return and check that it has equal to the expected result p  pOr should I be running a method against a mock to ensure that the method was actually called.p  pI have seen this done both ways, I wondered if anyone has any best practices for this.p  pOf course its quicker and easier to write a unit test to assert that a method was called on the mock but quicker and easier is not always the best way  although sometimes it can be.p  pWhat does everyone assert on, that a method has been called or assert the results that were returned p  pOf course its not best practice to do more than 1 assert in a unit test so maybe the answer is to actually assert the results and that the method was called  So I would create 2 unit tests, 1 to check the results and 1 to check that the method was called.p  pBut now thinking about this, maybe this is going too far, if i get a result that i suppose I can assume that my mock method was called.p  pI would really appreciate some feedback on this area.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 644 pI have a task to compare some Teradata Views with actual Oracle Tables. I need a script for that.I have taken Java approach in which I connect to a specific schema from Oracle and than call the codeSELECT  FROM alltables order by TABLENAMEcode query and write this into a file. I do the same for other schema but now my problem is Teradata. Can you people please suggest me some script or query by which I can get proper details like it does with Oracle.p  pThere is no complex Java Code but if you still want I can post it.p  pEditedp  pOkay now I have a schema in Oracle which has all the tables.so views for those tables are created in Teredata. I have to compare oracle tables and Teradata views every morning and send the differances. So I use codeSELECT  FROM alltables order by TABLENAMEcode in Oracle and for Teradata I use codeSELECT  FROM dbc.tables WHERE tablekindV AND databasenameSCHEMA order by TableNamecode so now when I compare them I dont get accurate results, so I wanted to know does any script exists or how do I approach.p

Negative 644 pI am a Google lover, and as thus Ive hunted around pretty thoroughly before arriving here. Perhaps Im just being inattentive, or my skimming habit is coming back to bite me, but I dont believe Ive found the answer yet.p  pIve seen solutions to similar problems, but I dont think any of them are applicable here. emI want to overlay two PNGs of the same size in an elementem this in itself is simple, but the context is a little more complex. Ive worked with HTMLCSS for a long time now, and Im learning JavaScript currently as such, Ive been making an HTML game. This game involves creating animals with different characteristics, and Ive drawn PNGs for each of the characteristics and saved them separately with transparent backgrounds. Here, for reference, is an examplep  pThe base imagep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comA2bAhYw.png altFrog base imagep  pEyelashes I want to overlay for female frogsp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comaf54sl3.png altFemale eye spritep  pI am familiar with using positionabsolute to overlay images, but I cant give an absolute position the creatures will be displayed automatically to a div alongside each other using innerHTML, which presents two problems one, not every creature will be in the same absolute position, and two, some will not be visible until the user scrolls down. Ive also thought about setting the background image as one image, but there will be scenarios which require the overlay of up to four individual images, so that wouldnt work. Ive come across some mysterious possibilities regarding jQuery, but since I havent gotten that far in my learning yet, Id appreciate very much if someone is able to help me. The only other alternative is to manually overlay and save every possible combination as an image, which would require several hundred images, so I fervently hope I can avoid that path at all costs.p  pIf Im just being stupid and the solution is already in one of the possibilities Ive considered and discarded, please let me know.p

What can be causing this I am pretty sure I didnt modify the variable in between, I am also pretty sure I didnt modify the variable using some pointers accidentally.p  pWhat can be causing this I am really confused Can it be related that I for example used whole available stack space of some function  and because of this compiler automatically 0ifies my variableor something similar I have some long code inside a single function f.p  pHeres whole details on usage of pointsEntered variable in my code how it is used.p  precode   Let the user input points     s32 pointsEntered  0   int pointsCounter  0   while1          ifpointsCounter  3        return  User entered wrong points 3 times, exit function       bool retStatus  false      retStatus  inputPointsamppointsEntered       iffalse  retStatus  If user didnt enter amount, exit this function        return       ifpointsEnteredgtatoiuserAmount           PromptBoxfalse, 0, Points should not be moren than current points        pointsCounter          continue            break      PROBLEM pointsEntered   is OK here but as it will be shown below, it gets modified down the way  even though I dont change it directly    char intTest1[50]   sprintfintTest1, 1pentered d, pointsEntered  Here the value is OK It shows value that I entered, e.g., 220   PromptBoxfalse, 0, intTest1         Let the user enter 4 digit pin code    u8 pinEntered[5]  0   bool retStatus1  false   retStatus1  inputPinpinEntered   pinEntered[5]0   iffalse  retStatus1  If user didnt enter amount, exit this function      return    char intTest2[50]   sprintfintTest2, 2pentered d, pointsEntered  Here pointsEnetered is OK   PromptBoxfalse, 0, intTest2       Compute hash of pin code   s32 siRet1  0   u8 pinVerify[25]0   u8 hashResult[16]  0   memcpypinVerify,pinEntered,4   memcpyamppinVerify[4],XXXX,21   siRet1  sdkMD5hashResult,pinVerify,25    char intTest3[50]   sprintfintTest3, 3pentered d, pointsEntered  Here pointsEntered has changed    PromptBoxfalse, 0, intTest3      convert string hash code to byte array    unsigned char val[16]  0   unsigned char  pos  pinHash   sizet count  0    WARNING no sanitization or errorchecking whatsoever    forcount  0 count lt sizeofvalsizeofval[0] count          sscanfpos, 2hhx, ampval[count]      pos  2  sizeofchar       char intTest4[50]   sprintfintTest4, 4pentered d, pointsEntered   PromptBoxfalse, 0, intTest4      Does the pin hash match     if siRet  SDKOK ampamp memcmphashResult,val,16        MsgBoxPIN OK,,0,SDKKEYMASKESC  SDKKEYMASKENTER      else        MsgBoxPIN doesnt matchexiting,,0,SDKKEYMASKESC  SDKKEYMASKENTER     return        char intTest[50]   sprintfintTest, pentered d, pointsEntered   PromptBoxfalse, 0, intTest   codepre

Negative 644 pi have a big problem with tetrahedral mesh... I want to create a a tetrahedral mesh 3D for a finite volume time domain code, giving as input two files .node and .ele.p  pThe format of .node is First line lt of points  lt of attributes lt of boundary markers 0 or 1 Remaining lines list  of points         [attributes] [boundary marker]     ... p  pThe format of .ele is First line lt of tetrahedra  lt of attributes Remaining lines list of  of tetrahedra          ... [attributes]     ... p  pFrom these 2 files, the Mesh class that i have developed, creates the Faces of each Tetrahedron starting from the nodes IDs and then create the Element Tetrahedron using the information of 4 nodes and 4 faces. The problem is that, with only these files, i dont have the information of the shared faces of each element, and so i have to do checks within the face list, in order to eliminate the doubles. This procedure takes a lot of time.. Does anybody knows a more intelligent method to overcome my problemp  pP.s i can also generate file .face and file .neigh the first lists all the faces not considering the doubles and the corresponding nodes, the second gives me information about the neighbour element of each tetraedron in terms of elements id not in terms of shared id faces.p  pThe format of .face is     First line lt of faces      Remaining lines list of  of faces         [boundary marker]     ... p  pThe format of .neigh is     First line lt of tetrahedra lt of nei. per tet always 4      Remaining lines list of  of neighbors              ... p  pMy problem is that my procedure takes a lot of time to identify the shared faces and delete them... I was asking if there was a more intelligent way to do that maybe using particular data structure or other methods with the information that i can generate .node, .ele, .face, .neigh p  pThanksp

Negative 644 pIm about to implement a memcached class which can be extended by our database class. However i have looked at many different ways of doing this.p  pMy First question was, what is the point in the codeMemcachedsetcode as it seems to replace the value of the key. Does this not defeat the object of caching your resultsp  pMy Second question was, technically speaking what is the fastestbest way to update the value of a key without checking the results every time the query is executed. If this happens, the results been retreived would have to be checked constantly so there would be no point in caching as the results would constantly be connecting to the mysql database.p  pLastly, What is the best way of creating a key most people recommend using MD5 however using MD5 on a PDO query would be the same regardless.p  pI.E.p  precodekey  MD5SELECT  FROM test WHERE category codepre  pthe category could produce many different results however the key would be constantly replaced.

Negative 644 pMy target language is C, but this is a question over object oriented programming in general.p  pSuppose I have a class for which testing equality takes a nontrivial amount of time, but I also have a hash value that I have computed over it. I can rely on the data to stay the same for the life of the object.p  pIs it common practice to cache the hash value, and use that to test for inequalityp  pTo make this example more concrete, I have a class that contains a potentially long list of 2D locations, and I expect to make many many equality comparisons over it. I create the hash value upon construction by mixing the hashes of all of the locations.p  pWhen testing for equality, I check the hash values first. If the hashes are equal, I do the exhaustive, pointbypoint equality test. Otherwise I call them unequal.p

Negative 644 pIm trying to align one large image in the center of the div.entrycontent on this page a hrefhttprowanibbeken.co.ukbanksidepowerstationbanksidelondon relnofollowhttprowanibbeken.co.ukbanksidepowerstationbanksidelondona i.e. I dont want the smaller images to effect the centering of the large image whilst Id like the purchase button table at the bottom to be in line with the large image. So far the main problem has been the div. After trying every centering method under the sun Im still unsure why its shifted to the right and has messed up the alignment of the whole page. If anyone has any advice on this that would be great. Thanks in advance Rowanp

Negative 644 pI was wondering if anybody ran into the same issue as I am facing now.p  pWhat Im trying to do is have a workflow that checks the condition of a field optionset of a form. If the field has option 1, 2 or 3 then create new record with certain shared attributes, otherwise start a child workflow. The child workflow is a Dialog process, not a workflow process which informs the user that the record was not created and why. For some reason I cannot select the dialog workflow from the dropdown list of available child workflows...p  pBoth the parent workflow and the dialog workflow process are based on the same entity.p  pIf anybody has any ideas on how I could debug this or any clues in general I would greatly appreciate your feedback.p  pThanks for taking the time to read this postp
Negative 644 pWhen working with Claims based identity with AspNet, in my case just using the templates coming with Visual studio 2013.p  pTaking the EntityFramework implementation of Microsoft.AspNet.Identity and looking at the User Model class. p  pIs it the intention that one put profile info into claims or to extend the user model with additional properties p  pAn example would be, I want to add a country associated with each user and edits the registration flow such user can give this information. Should I put this on the user or add it as a claim for that user.p

Negative 644 pI use an online questionnaire service like Survey Monkey to run surveys. Ive written a novel question type using JavaScript and HTML5 that allows respondents to draw a picture during the course of the survey currently the data generated is 3x0255 integers per canvas pixel. p  pFor a variety of reasons, I cant get the questionnaire service to store this output, so Id like to set up an Apache server on a Raspberry PI and add some code to my JavaScript which submits the data to this server, which could then store it in a text file it would have to deal with 100s of users, perhaps simultaneously. p  pIm familiar with python and cosmetic JavaScriptHTML, but I have no idea what Id enter into google to try and learn what I need to, let alone where to begin. Hoping someone can point me in the right direction.p  pThanksp

Negative 644 pI am reading about the difference between kmeans clustering and kmedoid clustering.p  pSupposedly there is an advantage to using the pairwise distance measure in the kmedoid algorithm, instead of the more familiar sum of squared Euclidean distancetype metric to evaluate variance that we find with kmeans.  And apparently this different distance metric somehow reduces noise and outliers.p  pI have seen this claim but I have yet to see any good reasoning as to the mathematics behind this claim.  p  pWhat makes the pairwise distance measure commonly used in kmedoid better  More exactly, how does the lack of a squared term allow kmedoids to have the desirable properties associated with the concept of taking a medianp

Negative 644 pI am using the samples provided by Amazon to make an app to upload videos to the server S3. The sample generates a bucket and stores an image there. In my case, I am using previously generated bucket to store the videos, but if I erase the bucket generation code the video upload stops in the way. The generated bucket is not used to store the video.

Negative 644 pAfter successful purchase I save receipttransactionID into codeNSUserDefaultscode. Same information is sent to server to keep a record.p  pLateron demand when user want to download content from my own server, my app will send receipttransactionID to server. It will find stored receipt by transaction ID sent from app, verify both stored and new receipts with Apple. If some of the keys matched then provide downloadable content.p  pHowever, nowadays its not hard to get hold of codeNSUserDefaultscode and extract receipttransactionID. Even if I place information in keychain, its possible to capture receipt from internet connection.p  pNow if someone will have receipttransactionID, can send a request to my server and get content from any PC. How can I patch this logic without using cryptographyp

Id like to keep a connection to each client alive while the user is using the application, to allow the server to push updates.p  pI believe that async IO is often recommended for these kinds of longlived connections, to avoid having lots of threads sitting idle. But what are the issues in having threads sitting idle I find the threaded model mentally easier to work with, but I dont want to do something that is going to cause me major headaches. I guess Ill have to experiment, but I wondered if anyone knows of any previous experiments along these linesp

Negative 644 pI want that a maven project can be used as a black box jar. This is needed because second project was born its way, and I dont want to integrate its code by hand. So the best way is that this project is going to save its data on db, but it should use a service offered by the wrapper project to save them.p  pThe idea is simple, the secondary project can expose just a method to which I will pass the service that offers the save method as a parameter.p  pThe secondary project should not have configuration files, but should rely on the father applications properties.p  pAny idea to do this fast and almsot good Thanks for any suggestion.p  pEDIT 20130307 The idea behind this is that the second project should generate a classic jar library that looks a properties file into the classpath of the host project. Something like QuartzSpring... you import jar and you provide the properties file.p

Negative 644 pIs it possible to selectively apply changes from one branch to another with Gitp  pMore specifically, I use a public codedevcode branch for GitHub and a private codemastercode branch for deployment.

In my case its a few css classes and a feed.p  pIm new to Git but Ive made my research p  ul lipcodegit merge nocommit noffcode can be used followed by a codegit mergetoolcode to chose what I want in case of a conflict. The problem is that it only works for conflicts Git cant automatically merge, so what I want to stay different gets replaced before I get the chance to use my mergetool.pli lipcodegit difftool cachedcode is useful as it allows me to see the differences, but I need to copy what I want to keep from there and manually replace it with a text editor, as I cannot simply choose and save like I can with mergetool.pli lipcodegit cherrypickcode seems to apply a specified commit to another, but what I want to stay different may be scattered to different commits, and these commits may not only include what I want to stay different. I cannot see this working unless I make millions of commits that would drive me mad.pli ul  pAlso to be clear, strongI dont want one branch to become anotherstrong, what seems to be the case with a merge. strongI want two separate branches with their respective differences and apply changes from one to the other.strongp  pIs there a better workflow that would allow me to keep a development and a deployment version by applying their changes and keeping a few differences I dont mind using separate repositories or different tools if it leads to a solution.p

Negative 644 pThere are two Pages A and B. On a small device, A should be displayed by default and B should be available with a swipe event.

Negative 644 pBeen banging my head against a brick wall for sometime with this problem. Was hoping I may be able to get some help here.p  pBasically, my game has an inventory system with a number of different objects. There are different classes derived from the base class Object and they use virtual functions in order to have different behaviour with the same function call. p  pOriginally, I had a list inventory as well as a listiterator invIter. The iterator would call the functions I needed for the right object in the inventory but would only call base class functions. I read from another answer that the reason for this is because you lose the polymorphic nature when you do this but having a list of pointers would remedy it.p  pSo I changed the list and iterator so they were Object pointers and found out the supposedly correct way to access the functions and variables of the inventory objects. However, when these functions or variables get accessed at runtime, the program has an unhandled exception and breaks.p  pThis is my code which causes the issue....p  pHeaderp  precodeinclude Object.h include ltvectorgt include ltlistgt  using namespace std  class Player  public     Player      void addItemObject     void printInventory      listltObjectgt inventory  private         listltObjectgtiterator invIter         codepre  pcppp  precodeinclude Player.h include Object.h  include ltiostreamgt    PlayerPlayer     void PlayeraddItemObject newItem      inventory.pushbackampnewItem     return    void PlayerprintInventory      cout ltlt YOU ARE CARRYING n     forinvIterinventory.begin invIterinventory.end invIter                      cout ltlt invItergtgetName ltlt ,             cout ltlt nPRESS RETURN TO CONTINUE...     cin.ignore1     return  codepre  pAny help is much appreciated, Ive honestly hit a dead end myself.p

Instead, strongjust let users pick a new one right awaystrong  which is what they want to do anyway.p      pIf a user forgets their password, send them a secure onetime reset link, using a randomly generated reset token stored in the database.

Negative 644 pI have worked on triangle mesh for a while. The mesh is reconstructed from range images captured via one 3D scanner. Currently I am very interested in using parametric surfaces to represent one mesh. It says from one book that emParametric surfaces are defined by a vectorvalued parameterization function that maps a 2D parameter domain to the surface.em  However, the parameter domain is always written as u, v instead of x,y. In my view, parameter domainx,y is very straightforward.  p  pIn computeraided geometric design where NURBS surface is popularly employed, the NURBS surface is represented by parameter domain u,v, is it difficult to find the parameter domainu,v from cartesian coordinates of pointsp

Negative 644 pLets say we have a problem where there are several cities with variable path costs in time taken between them, and we have 2 salesmen that must visit every city at least once, between the two of them. p  pNow, suppose we have an algorithm that given a salesman and a set of cities, can devise an optimal path for that salesman. What we want to do is split up the cities in such a way that assigning one set to the first salesman and the other set to the other salesman gives us a solution that allows the total time taken to be as low as possible. What is a good way to do this We want a solution thats good, but not necessarily optimal.p  pMy thought was that we could use some sort of heuristic to determine whether a given split was good or bad, but there are a lot of cities and so picking the split is hard. Im not entirely sure how to go about this.p  pTo clarify each city must be visited by at least one salesman, not both.p  pEdit its more a Hamiltonian path, we dont need to return to the origin city.p

Negative 644 pOk, so I found out theres a close event on an ajax get request when user closes brower or goes to diff page, before the server had a chance to reply.

Negative 644 pI am using C with MSTest and one thing I find completely incomprehensible is why unit test classes are not excluded by default from code coverage analysis.p  pThe code coverage analysis tool strongmuststrong surely be able to determine that a class is a test class. The class is decorated with a [TestClass] attribute after all. The way to exclude the class is by adding an [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] attribute so the tool can happily inspect attributes.p  pstrongSo is there any reason at all why a developer or development team would want to include code coverage analysis for test classesstrong p  pAnswer The intent of code coverage for test classes is to show test code that is not being executed and acts as an alert to the quality of the test code.p  pI think what was confusing me is that there appear to be two different code coverage definitionsp  p1 Measure the coverage of applicationproduction code by a test suitep  p2 Measure the coverage of all code when running a test suitep  pI have always understood code coverage under the first definition which completely excludes test code from the picture.p  pSo my question should really be why code coverage is reporting my test code as not executing when it actually is, but that is probably a different question.p

Negative 644 pWere using a semiagile process at the moment where we still write a designspecification document and update it during the development process.p  pWhen were refining our requirements we often hit edge cases where we decide its not important to handle it, so we dont write any code for that use case and we dont test it. In the design spec we explicitly state that this scenario is out of scope because the system isnt designed to be used in that way.p  pIn a more fullyfledged agile process, the tests are supposed to act as a specification for the expected behaviour of the system, but how would you record the fact that a certain scenario is explicitly outofscope rather than just getting accidentally missed outp  pAs a bit of clarification, heres the situation Im trying to avoid We have discussed a scenario and decided we wont handle it because it doesnt make sense. Then later on, when someone is trying to write the user guide, or give a training session, or a customer calls the help desk, exactly the same scenario comes up, so they ask me how the system handles it, and I think I remember talking about this a year ago, but there are no tests for it. Maybe it got missed of the plan, or maybe we decided it wasnt a sensible usecase, or maybe theres a subtle reason why you cant actually ever get into that situation, so I have to try and search old skype chats or emails to find out the answer. What I want to achieve is to make sure we have a record of why we decided not to support that scenario so that I can refer back to it in the future. At the moment I put this in the spec where everyone can see it.p

Negative 644 pI am using Tabhost in Android app for navigation.  All works well, however one of my tabs is for Messages and if the user has at least 1 message, Id like to add a textview to the tab icon showing the number of messages the user has.  So basically I have the icon and the text Messages below, and would like to have an additional textview on the top right of the tab icon showing the message count.p  pIve found posts related to adding text to the tab, however it merely modifies the existing tab indicator textview.  Is it possible to have an additional textview on the tab that I can reference and have set to visibility gone normally, and if messages exist update the visibility to visible and show the countp  pIm guessing Ill need to create a custom XML layout for this tab and use it when calling p  pcode.setIndicatorMessages,res.getDrawableR.drawable.tabmessagescodep  pAny insight or examples are greatly appreciated, thank youp
Negative 644 pIve been having this issue for a few days now and it is really starting to annoy me as I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong.

Negative 644 pThe effect Im trying to achieve is upon clicking a button a circle made up of 8 triangles spins around. When it stops the triangle at the top of the circle is selected. Then a fancybox overlay relative to the selected segment is opened this last part doesnt work yet. The order the segments are selected appears random to the user but it can be preset as Ive done in the CSS currently 3rd  6th  1st  8th  2nd  5th  7th  4th.p  pIve created a codepen to show my current progress on this which you can see by visiting the link below as its quite hard to explain.p  precodehttpcodepen.iomoypenDrbAL codepre  pOn clicking the Spin button the circle rotates 3 times 1080 degrees  an additional 270 degrees so the 3rd listitem is positioned at the top of the div  this works fine.p  pMy 1st question is On the 2nd click of the button, the circle needs to rotate 3 times again and then a bit more to position the next selected listitemsegment 6 at the top of the div and so on for each of the remaining items. Is there a way to do this without having to add 1080 to the amount the circle has already rotated So the value is always code1080degcode  the additional amount the circle needs to rotate to position the relevant segment at the top of the div. Otherwise the last items value is going to be something like 10000 degrees If this has to be done I guess Ill have to live with it and get my maths hat on.p  pThe 2nd question is Once the circle has finished rotating, how can I display the related fancybox overlay The IDs are currently the title of each overlay but could easily be overlay1, overlay2, etc to match the classes of spin1, spin2 set on the spinning wheel after each spin.p  pThanks, hope someone can helpp

Negative 644 pI am trying to write large files 500 MByte to disk using Node.js. I figured out that while the first few files are being written in a few seconds typically, 3 to 5 seconds, starting with around the 10th file things tend to get slower and it wont recover.p  pThe setup consists of a server that accepts files via a TCPIP socket and pipes them to diskp  precodevar fs  requirefs,     net  requirenet,     path  requirepath  var counter  0  net.createServerfunction socket    console.timereceived   console.timewritten    counter    var filename  path.joindirname, temp  counter  .tmp   var file  fs.createWriteStreamfilename,  encoding utf8     socket.pipefile    socket.onceend, function       console.timeEndwritten       file.oncefinish, function       console.timeEndreceived    .listen3000 codepre  pI send the data from the terminal using codenccode in the following wayp  precode while [ true ] do cat input.tmp  nc localhost 3000 done codepre  pRunningp  precode time cat input.tmp gt devnull codepre  phas shown that cat reads the files in always the same time. If I replace the output path of the Node.js script to codedevnullcode the writing, too, always happens in the same time.p  pSo the problem apparently is related to actually writing to disk.p  pI first thought that it emmayem be a problem with concurrent reads and writes, but the problem even persists when I runp  precode while [ true ] do cat input.tmp  nc localhost 3000 sleep 5 done codepre  pIf I run the same test with an even larger file twice as large, i.e. 1 GByte then it takes around half the time until the writing gets slower.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve changed my Node.js application to write everything to a emsingleem file, which gets appended on and on and on the server now looks like thisp  precodevar fs  requirefs,     net  requirenet,     path  requirepath  var filename  path.joindirname, temp.tmp var file  fs.createWriteStreamfilename,  encoding utf8   net.createServerfunction socket    console.timereceived   console.timewritten    socket.pipefile,  end false     socket.onceend, function       console.timeEndwritten    .listen3000 codepre  pNow the problem is gone, so apparently it has to do with writing multiple files in a row. At least emIem cant see where I am writing multiple files at the same time am I, so I can not think of a reason why this should happen. Especially the usage of codesleep 5code should make sure that the OS has really written everything to disk.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pI originally tested using Node.js 0.10.32. As soon as I switch to 0.11.13, the effect is not gone completely, but it takes emwayem more time until it happens. In the original setup, the problem arose at around 10 cycles, with Node.js 0.11.13 it happens earliest on cycle 30.p  pAny idea what might cause this behaviorp

Unfortunately that build file doesnt build a JAR that works from the command line.  Some Netbeans magic allows the demos to run in the Netbeans console.p  pI resolved this by making a command line program and in the Main for that program I can call the same Listener or Publisher code.  I can run the new Publisher from the command line and the old Listener receives the files.  However ...p  pWhen I run the new Listener from the command line it never receives the messages from either Publisher.  p  pWhen I run the new Listener from within Netbeans never receives the messages from both Publishers, run separately of course.  p  pI am not seeing any errors in the Listener demo when on the command line.  I dont see anything in the debugger either, since the Listener program seems to work from inside Netbeans.p  pMost of all Im looking for a viable command line example of both Listener and Publisher programs.  p  pI would like to know what goes awry with the Listener program when it runs from the command line.  I wondered if theres an issue with the Listener running in a separate JavaVM  However a Listener running in Netbeans can hear the Publisher program when it is run from the command line  Seems that separate VMs is probably not the problem.  Any ideas on things I might tryp  pThe last issue of course is to ask what diagnostics, statuses or options I can check on the nonworking program with some println statements.

Negative 644 pI implemented this REST API guide a hrefhttpwww.yiiframework.comwiki175howtocreatearestapi relnofollowhttpwww.yiiframework.comwiki175howtocreatearestapia just so you know the context.   I have this rule in the main.php configs URL manager codearrayapidelete, patterngtapiltmodelwgtltiddgt, verbgtDELETE,codep  pUp until today it was working all fine. I implemented the DELETE call to apicomments and based on the example code my API was replying with an error if the ID parameter was missing. Starting today though the whole URL rule emstops applyingem if the ID is not there.   So if I send DELETE apicomments the URLmanager skips it entirely. Same if I send DELETE api without the method, it still doesnt apply.  In both cases, based on the above line of code, and as far as I am aware, it should direct me to api controllers delete action, should it notp  pWhat could be wrong I honestly dont know of changing anything even remotely connected to URL managing.p  pThank you.p

Negative 644 pIm using Django 1.7. Ive got a default custom manager that filters on an active boolean field. According to the docs, it needs to be the default manager to work with related fields ie. accessing User.storyset only shows active Story objects.

Negative 644 pI have made a client and a server application to screenshare my desktop to the client. I do this by screen capturing my desktop using the robot class, saving the image as a PNG, and then sending it to the client, which is then read and displayed on the client. This works, however, there is a 24 second lag time until the image is displayed. I would like to get it as efficient as possible, like Skype ScreenSharing seems instantaneous. Is there a better way of going about this or is this as good as JAVA can get I read something about video streams, but would this be faster or is there a better way than either of thosep

Negative 644 pId like to do a tournament shuffling. For example i have 15 players and id like to create a playoff table. p  pSo my idea would work in a way that id write all the players in the column, lets say its column B. Then the so called macro will draft a number for every player in range 1playerCount one number for one player. After that the players are assigned in the playoff table which is really easy to do in Excel with borderlines. p  pIn coding manner it could work in a way that every person in a column gets drafted a number. The numbers are in a list. So lets say we have 15 players, at first there are numbers 115 in a list. Then a list gets shuffled basically same as drafting a random number but we dont have to start searching for unassigned numbers. First element or last, doesent matter will be assigned for the player. So now players all get random numbers which will draft them into the table. These numbers 115 could represent the column X maybe, where the names should go into and then the values in this column change.p  pMy question is  how hard would it be to implement this kind of thing As a Java Programmer i watch this idea and id think that doing something in JAVA it shouldnt take long and would be pretty easy. The problem with JAVA is that then the UI needs to be coded and creating UI which makes playoff tables isnt the easiest solution. p

Negative 644 pSuppose, in Django 1.6, you have the following model codep  precodeclass FooManagermodels.Manager     def getqueryset         return ...  i.e. return a custom queryset  class Foomodels.Model     foomanager  FooManager codepre  pIf, outside the codeFoocode model definition e.g. in view code or in the shell, you dop  precodeFoo.objects  FooManager Foo.objects.all codepre  pyoull get an exception in the Django internal code on codeFoo.objects.allcode due to a variable named codelookupmodelcode being None.p  pHowever, if you instead dop  precodeFoo.objects  Foo.foomanager Foo.objects.all codepre  pThe codeFoo.objects.allcode will work as expected, i.e. as if codeobjectscode had been defined to be codeFooManagercode in the model definition in the first place.p  pI believe this behavior is due to Django working its magic in creating managers during model definition just as it works magic in creating model fields. p  pMy question is there any reason NOT to assign codeobjectscode to an alternate manager in this way outside of the model definition It seems to work fine, but I dont fully understand the internals so want to make sure.p  pIn case you are wondering, the context is that I have a large code base with many typical references to codeobjectscode. I want to have this code base  work on different databases dynamically, i.e. based on a request URL parameter. My plan is to use middleware that sets codeobjectscode for all relevant models to managers that point to the appropriate database. The rest of the app code would then go on its merry way, using codeobjectscode without ever having to know anything has changed.p

Negative 644 pI have a Django web server that accepts requests from clients. In addition, I have another server, written with a hrefhttpstwistedmatrix.com relnofollowTwisteda. I wrote a Twisted protocol  its server half is running on the server, and I have a very easy to use client protocol as well.p  pOccasionally the Django server receives requests that need to initiate a request to the Twisted server. This may obviously be a long operation, so it cannot be synchronous. Im having trouble incorporating a Twisted client inside the Django project to make these requests.p  pSimplifying the architecture a bit, it looks something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comonVHq.png altenter image description herep  pInitially, I created a global thread instance in the views.py file of my Django project that runs Twisteds reactor loop, and whenever a request was received through the Django server, Id add it to the reactor asynchronously to be performed by that thread. This worked fine with the codepython manage.py runservercode script, however when I ran it on my Apache server I would sometimes get the requests on the Twisted server and sometimes wouldnt.p  pIm assuming this is because Apache also runs several threads, each of which tries to create that reactorthread. Since there may only be one reactor per process, only one thread succeeds while the others fail, therefore only some requests make it through  the ones in the winning thread this is just a theory, I havent verified it.p  pI believe my options arep  ol liSomehow share my reactorthread instance among all Apache threads so that theres really just one reactor. Not sure exactly how to do this  everything I find online talks about sharing strongdatastrong through Djangos DB, not sharing instances.li liRun the Twisted client as a separate process on the Django server machine, and send requests from Django with some RPC method that is not Twistedbased  otherwise Id be back in square one of running a Twisted client inside Django, which I cannot seem to be able to do....li ol  pAny advice on what is the correct solution  how to implement it Is there another way Im not thinking ofp  pThank you.p

So i have BaseFragment, which binds service for all Fragments neededp  precodepublic abstract class BaseFragmentltTgt extends CustomListFragmentltTgt      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         getActivity.getApplicationContext.bindServicenew IntentgetActivity.getApplicationContext,                  WeekplanUpdateService.class, connection, Context.BINDAUTOCREATE       codepre  pWhen i go to next activity, it fragment will bind service, and my previous fragment will call request again, and will have counts.

Negative 644 pIm a little bit confused with the behaviour of springboot when overwriting specific autoconfigurations.p  pI like to partly overwrite the BatchAutoConfiguration, but I guess, my question is not specific to BatchAutoConfiguration. Actually, I just want to overwrite two methods of this class codepublic BatchDatabaseInitializer batchDatabaseInitializercode and codepublic ExitCodeGenerator jobExecutionExitCodeGeneratorcode.p  pTherefore, Ive written the following code     package ch.test.autoconfig.autoconfigurep  precodeimport org.springframework.batch.core.launch.JobLauncher import org.springframework.boot.ExitCodeGenerator import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfigureAfter import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfigureBefore import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.batch.BatchAutoConfiguration import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.batch.BatchDatabaseInitializer import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.batch.BatchProperties import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.batch.JobExecutionExitCodeGenerator import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition.ConditionalOnBean import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition.ConditionalOnClass import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition.ConditionalOnMissingBean import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.EnableConfigurationProperties import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcOperations  import javax.sql.DataSource     Im using the same annotations as defined in BatchAutoConfiguration...   Configuration ConditionalOnClass JobLauncher.class, DataSource.class, JdbcOperations.class  AutoConfigureAfterHibernateJpaAutoConfiguration.class ConditionalOnBeanJobLauncher.class EnableConfigurationPropertiesBatchProperties.class   ... but I add AutoConfigureBeforeBatchAutoConfiguration.class to take precedence over BatchAutoConfiguration AutoConfigureBeforeBatchAutoConfiguration.class public class JavabatchAutoConfiguration       Bean     ConditionalOnMissingBean     ConditionalOnBeanDataSource.class     public BatchDatabaseInitializer batchDatabaseInitializer          System.out.printlnEntering overwritten batchDatabaseInitializer         return new BatchDatabaseInitializer           Bean     ConditionalOnMissingBean     public ExitCodeGenerator jobExecutionExitCodeGenerator          System.out.printlnEntering overwritten jobExecutionExitCodeGenerator         return new JobExecutionExitCodeGenerator       codepre  pAs mentioned in the code, Im using the exact same annotions for the class and methods, as they are definend in codeBatchAutoConfiguration.classcode. The only exception is adding codeAutoConfigureBeforeBatchAutoConfiguration.classcode. Since this should take precedence over BatchAutoConfiguration, I assumed, that this would kind of overwrite the original.p  pTo test is, I use the following pom.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt  ltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0          xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance          xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0          httpmaven.apache.orgxsdmaven4.0.0.xsdgt       ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt      ltgroupIdgtch.test.autoconfigltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtautoconfigtestltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt1.0SNAPSHOTltversiongt      ltparentgt         ltgroupIdgtorg.springframework.bootltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtspringbootstarterparentltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt1.2.3.RELEASEltversiongt     ltparentgt      ltdependenciesgt         ltdependencygt             ltgroupIdgtorg.springframework.bootltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtspringbootstarterbatchltartifactIdgt         ltdependencygt     ltdependenciesgt ltprojectgt codepre  pAnd Im using the this simple job with a main methodp  precodepackage ch.test.autoconfig  import org.springframework.batch.core.Job import org.springframework.batch.core.Step import org.springframework.batch.core.StepContribution import org.springframework.batch.core.configuration.annotation.EnableBatchProcessing import org.springframework.batch.core.configuration.annotation.JobBuilderFactory import org.springframework.batch.core.configuration.annotation.StepBuilderFactory import org.springframework.batch.core.scope.context.ChunkContext import org.springframework.batch.core.step.tasklet.Tasklet import org.springframework.batch.repeat.RepeatStatus import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean     Created by U802552 on 01.06.2015.

As the report also states, the original BatchAutoConfiguration class has a positive match for the same codeConditionalOnBeancodecheck.p  pIf I comment codeConditionalOnBeanJobLauncher.classcodeon the class and codeConditionalOnBeanDataSource.classcodeon the codebatchDatabaseInitializercodemethod, everything works as expected.p  pDoes anybody have an explanation for this behaviourp  pThanks Hansjrgp

Negative 644 pI am debugging some java legacy code which is using a lot of stored procedures. All of them are in source code and in DB.

Its important to do it with code behind. Thanks in advancep

Negative 644 pBasically Im asked to prepare a project which will be trained using past system metrics and then predict weather the system is going to face an error in future or not.p  pI divided the whole project into 2 models namely Predictive model amp Forecasting Model.p  pI use Bayesian Classifier in Predictive model where it uses real time system metrics to Predict weather the dataset corresponds to an error state or not.p  pI plan on using Time series forecasting to predict future metrics by observing trends and apply Bayesian on foretasted metrics thus helping me forecast weather an error is coming up or not.p  pMy dataset consists of cpu usage mem usage server io response times real time orders and sometimes there are huge fluctuations in these values like orders drop to 0. Im thinking to corelate each system metrics and how it affects my orders and then apply Time series on that. p  pBut the problem Im facing is that Im new to Time series amp Forecasting models. Even I saw some articles where is was mentioned Forecasting using Bayesian classifiers as well as Random Forest or CUSUM but Im at loss on how to implement it. How to start and how to forecast future statesvalues.p  pI didnt even find any relevant links. Any leads would be gratefully appreciated. Im using Python amp Matlab. p  pI can also use regression models or Support vector machines but how to define model function in regression I dont know neither how to train in Neural network. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 644 pOne of my friends was asked this question on hadoop MapReduce  We have multiple stores and each stores have many customers visiting and buying stuff. the dataset consists of Store, Customer, Quantity purchased. Need a MapReduce code to get the Top 2 customers for each store. p  pThe solution which i thought of was to do a secondary sort on qty in descending order  store  qty makes the composite key and in the reducer just display first 2 values or customers for each Key store  qty, qty is part of composite key. This works if the customer is unique, but if the customer has visited the same store multiple times then how do we do itp  pThe solution is to loop thru each value, add qty for each customer, sort it by qty in the reducer. This would mean i will be doing the sort logic all over again and not sure if i can use a TreeMapHashmap etc since there might be memory constraints.  p  por the solution is to write 2 MapRed which runs one after the other. The firs one to get a sum of qty purchased for each customer and store. The second MapRed to sort by qty and get the top 2 buyers. p  pAny other way of achieving this Also considering memory constraints p

Negative 644 pIm working in a CQt project for Embedded Linux where we are constantly duelling against the limitations of our processor specially when it comes to updating the graphs in the user interface. Thanks to those limitations and specially our situation some time ago when things were even worse, I try to optimize the code always when I can and if the costs of optimization are minimum. One of such optimizations I was doing is to always use the correct integer value for the situation Im handling qint8, qint16 and qint32 depending on how big is the value I need.p  pBut some time ago I read somewhere that instead of trying to use the minimal size of integer when possible, I should always prefer to use the integer value related to the capacity of my processor, that is, if my processor is 32bit oriented, then I should prefer to use qint32 always even when such a big integer wasnt required. In a first moment I couldnt understand why, but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1097467whyshouldiuseintinsteadofabyteorshortincsharpthe answer to this questiona suggest that is because the performance of the processor is greater when it has to work with its default size of integer.p  pWell Im not convinced. First of all no actual reference was provided confirming such a thesis I just cant understand why writing and reading from a 32bit memory space would be slower then doing it with 32 bit integer and the explanation given wasnt much comprehensible, btw. Second there are some moments on my app when I need to transfer data from one side to the other such as when using Qts signals and slots mechanism. Since Im transferring data from one point to the other shouldnt smaller data always give an improvement over bigger data I mean a signal sending two chars not by reference isnt supposed to do the work quicker then sending two 32 bit integersp  pIn fact, while the processor explanation suggests using the characteristics of your processor, other cases suggests the opposite. For example, when dealing with databases, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19038646doesusingsmallintdatatypeoverintinmysqlactuallysavememorythisa and a hrefhttpdba.stackexchange.comquestions4968whentousetinyintoverintthisa threads both suggests that there is an advantage even if just in emsomeem cases in using smaller versions of integer.p  pSo, after all, should I prefer to use small types of int when the context allows or not Or is there a list of cases when one approach or the other is more likely to give better or worst results e.g. I should use int8 and int16 when using databases but the default type of my processor in all other situationsp  pAnd as a last question Qt normally have intbased implemenations of its functions. In such cases, doesnt the cast operation annihilates any possible improvement that one could have by using minor integersp

We can fire search requests to this engine and get some results to show to the user.p  pThe idea is to change our application so that we can search ANY kind of resource a database, a webpage, etc. We should be able to plugin any kind of resource adapter pattern, fire search requests to them and combine all different kinds of responses img, text, objects etc to a single JSON response.p  pI am thinking of implementing a single interfacefacade that will forward a search request to different clients. An adapter might be needed to transform all results into the same response format.

Negative 644 pThis may be a stupid question, but I have read that using the onbeforeunload event to detect when a page is closed or navigated away from is unreliable. Im trying to record this event for a pageview tracking application. Something else I thought of was to open a web socket connection and then record when this connection closes. Is this something that would work or is it overkill and would add too much unnecessary overhead to the page The app is using a javascript tracking code inserted into the page to be tracked and is logging to a Rails backend.p

Negative 644 pIm really stuck here. I am working on a project at work that requires me to merge several images into one. I have seen several posts describing how to do it using PIL, but none of them answered the question of what to do if you have any arbitrary number of channels. p  pThe project is specifically an algorithm for image segmentation. The data supplied to it will be data gathered from an xray microscope of various biological samples. The final product is a collection of many grayscale images, each one representing a different elemental channel. Meaning, there is a grayscale image of the location of Fe, K, P, Si, etc., in the sample. This is no different than pulling an RGB image apart into 3 separate, onedimensional images arrays.p  pIt is simple to merge those RGB channels back together so that p  pcodeR 2,3,6... 3  G 5,5,7... 4  B 1,3,2 ... 2codep  pbecomesp  pcodeRGB [2,5,1, 3,5,3, 6,7,2,... 3,4,2]codep  pBut I need to know how to do this when there are more or less than three channels. Some of the users of the microscope gather dozens and dozens of elemental channels, while some gather 2 or 3. I can fairly simply build the final array of data as shown in the example above, I just dont know how to actually write it to an image. Here is a shortened version of what I havep  precodedef mergeImagesimageList      allData  []     allSizes  []     mergedData  numpy.zerosmaxallSizes, lenimageList      for image in imageList         data  ImageFileDataimage         allData.appenddata.GetImageData      for data in allData         allSizes.appenddata1.GetImageSize      try         for i in rangelenallData             for j in rangelenallData[i]                 mergedData[j][i]  allData[i][j]         return True      except         qt.QMessageBoxImage merge failed.         return False codepre  pWhere codedatacode is an image object, and data.GetImageData simply returns a list of integer intensity values since each image given should be grayscale. p  pI have tested this, and codemergedDatacode ends up being correctly built, as a 2dimensional array with as many components for each pixel as there are images. p  pBut for the actual segmentation part of my algorithm to work, I need to pass it an emimage fileem, not the raw data. Im sure I could make it so it can accept the raw data, and work fine, but I dont want to have to do that yet because I would also like the merged image to be viewable. p  pSo I want to be able to write codemergedDatacode to an image file, to do an assortment of things. p  pHowever, PIL says that it does not support userdefined image modes, and to call codeImage.writecode, you emmustem supply the image mode as an argument none of which go beyond 4 channels. p  pSo I dunno, if anyone here has experience with Image Processing that would be fantastic. Im not even sure if an image with an arbitrary number of pixel values emcouldem be viewable. Maybe I would have to map a color to each component. I dunno. Before I even get to viewing, though, I want this to be able to write codemergedDatacode to an image file. p  pThank youp

Negative 644 pIm going through a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdatadatamongodocs1.7.2.RELEASEreferencehtml relnofollowSpring Data MongoDB  Reference Documentationa and Im finding the examples to be a bit too simplistic.p  pIn particular Im trying to understand how to handle stale data in concurrent environments. For instance, imagine I have the following entityp  precodepublic class Person       private final String username     private final String firstname     private final String lastname      [...]   codepre  pNow if I use codeCrudRepositorycode to saveupdateremove my entities, then imagine a scenario in which two threads retrieve the same entity, one of them removes it, and the other one updates its codelastnamecode field. If the codedeletecode call completes before the codesavecode call then my entity will be removed and then recreated, when the expected behaviour would be for the codesavecode operation to fail.p  pSo far Ive seen two options for getting around this issuep  ol liUse codeVersioncode annotation. Could not find any documentation saying Spring Data supports optimistic locking in MongoDB using versioned documents. If anyone can point me to a link itd be appreciated.li lipUse codeMongoOperations.findAndModifycode and fail if it returns codenullcode. The downside to this approach is that I can no longer implement my repository API to have get entity and save updated entity kind of semantics. e.g. p  precodeUser user  userRepository.findByUsernameuniqueUsername user.setLastNameArcher userRepository.updateuser codepreli ol  pI would have to push some of this to the repository I guessp  precodeuserRepository.updateLastnameuniqueUsername, Archer codepre  pBut Im a little bit worried my repository interfaces will grow uncontrollably if every type of update I want to do requires a new method.p  pI realise I havent actually stated a question yet, so here it goes whats the bestpractice for designing an application using Spring Data for MongoDBp

Im using a 9DOF sensor 3 axes of accelerometer data, 3 axes gyroscopic, and 3 axes of magnetic data to determine its roll, pitch and yaw and also its direction.p  pHow is it possible to identify accurately the location of the robot in Cartesian x,y,z coordinates relative to its starting position I cannot use a GPS since the movement is less that 20cm per rotation and the robot will be used indoors.p  pI found some indoor ranging and 3D positioning solutions like a hrefhttpswww.pozyx.iostoredetail2 relnofollowpozyxa or by using a fixed camera. However I need it to be cost efficient.p  pIs there any way to convert the 9DOF data to get the new location or any other sensor to do that Any other solution such as an algorithmp

Negative 644 pMy objective is to have an agentset named ships hatch at another agentset named ports and listed in index containing 2 locations representing the start and end of a pathway.

Negative 644 pI have a UITextView showing some dynamic content that can vary in size.  The textview has no scrolling allowed and its size is independent from the content.
