Negative 88155 pI have a scenario in a system which Ive tried to simplify as best as I can. We have a table of lets call them artefacts, artefacts can be accessed by any number of security roles and security roles can access any number of artefacts. As such, we have 3 tables in the database  one describing artefacts, one describing roles and a manytomany association table linking artefact ID to Role ID.p  pDomain wise, we have two classes  one for a role and one for an artefact. the artefact class has an IList property that returns a list of roles that can access it. Roles however do not offer a property to get artefacts that can be accessed.p  pAs such, the nhibernate mapping for artefact contains the followingp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltbag nameAccessRoles tableArtefactAccess orderbyRoleID      lazytrue accessfield.camelcaseunderscore optimisticlockfalsegt     ltkey columnArtefactIDgt     ltmanytomany classRole columnRoleIDgt ltbaggt codepre  pThis all works fine and if I delete an artefact, the association table is cleaned up appropriately and all references between the removed artefact and roles are removed the role isnt deleted though, correctly  as we dont want orphans deleted.p  pThe problem is  how to delete a role and have it clear up the association table automatically. If I presently try to delete a role, I get a reference constraint as there are still entries in the association table for the role. The only way to successfully delete a role is to query for all artefacts that link to that role, remove the role from the artefacts role collection, update the artefacts and then delete the role  not very efficient or nice, especially when in the unsimplified system, roles can be associated with any number of other tablesobjects.p  pI need to be able to hint to NHibernate that I want this association table cleared whenever I delete a role  is this possible, and if so  how do I do itp  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 88155 pPlease bear with me if this question isnt well formulated.

Negative 88155 pIve been having to do some basic feed processing. So, get a file via ftp, process it i.e. get the fields I care about, and then update the local database. And similarly the other direction get data from db, create file, and upload by ftp.

Negative 88155 pI started experimenting with Spring Roo just recently. It does a very nice job helping one build a domain model with integrated persistence rather quickly. As it adds persistence functionality in aspects, I started think about the following questionp  pRoo adds finders load an instance of a class from the database which meets variable criteria in an aspect to the actual classentity. In DDD this is IMHO the responsibility of repositories. Repositories are explicit classes which show up in the design. Of course as an aspect the repository functionality is hidden in an entity and is pretty much invisible.p  pSo here is the question Is an aspect a real substitute for a explicit repository class Are there any downsides to the Roo AOP approachp

Negative 88155 pMy point is, if you dont understand the abstraction of a framework, you can still decompile it and understand it, because you know the language e.g. Java. However, when bytecode generation happens, you have to understand even a lower level  JVM level bytecodes. I am really affraid of using any of such frameworks, which are many. Most of the time I think the reason for bytecode generation is simply lack of language features such as metaprogramming. Do you agree What is your opinion and argument How do you take over the problem with leaky abstractions in those frameworksp

Negative 88155 pI have an mxml panel in which Im using a repeater. The panel can be resized horizontally and I would like for the repeated components to resize together with panel. Here is a simplified example of how things look likep  precodeltmxTitleWindow xmlnsmxhttpwww.adobe.com2006mxml layoutvertical ...gt     lt scripts and some controls gt     ltmxVBox width100gt         ltcoreRepeater width100 dataProvidermodelgt             ltns1MyItemRenderer width100 gt         ltcoreRepeatergt     ltmxVBoxgt ltmxTitleWindowgt codepre  pWhen I resize the component, the width of the repeated items does not change.p  pThere also buttons and event handlers, which add and remove items from the model. When this is done, the repeater updates to display the correct number of items and all the items are resized correctly. p  pI have not been able to get the items to resize when the root panel is resized. I can see, that the VBOx around the repeater is getting a resize event. However, the repeated items are not getting the event. I tried to dispatch a resize event to the repeated items manually from a resize handler I hooked up to the VBox but that didnt help.p  pI also tried adding and removing a dummyitem from the ArrayCollection which is the dataProvider because that triggers a correct resize otherwise as mentioned above However, doing this in the resize handler of the VBox just leads to the repeater not showing any items at all.p  pIs there any way to get items in a repeater to resize with their enclosing containerp  pThe ItemRenderer Im using resizes correctly when used in a mxList. It is built so it can work both with the data property set by the List container an getRepeaterItem when used in a Repeater. In this particular case, I cannot use the List as a container because of the way it behaves with regards to controlling its height via the rowCount, height and maxHeight properties which doesnt work out for me in this particular case I spare you the details.p

Negative 88155 pI am working on a program for the mapping and playing of the popular tabletop game DampD D Right now I am working on getting the basic functionality like dragging UI elements around, snapping to the grid and checking for collisions.p  pRight now every object when released from the mouse immediately snaps to the nearest grid point.

Negative 88155 pIm a little confused about using release vs. debug versions of a dll for a live site.

Whats infuriating, though, is that if I were writing to the DB with a DataAdapter which would be far slower, the bad rows in the DataSet would have HasErrors turned on so I could easily find them and take care of things.

Negative 88155 pI came across an issue some time ago that I never did get to the bottom of. Hopefully somebody can shine a light on it. What causes certain browsers Chrome, Opera and Safari to render a page differently when I change the DOCTYPE from strict to transitional. I know the general cause of this is quirks mode being triggered, but both the XHTML and CSS for both files validate according to the w3c validator.p  pI can only assume that these browsers use different internal style sheets for the two DOCTYPEs, but have no real idea why they would do so. I was just hoping somebody could confirm why this happens.p  pThe difference that can be seen is the space between the bottom of the header image and the border of the menu bar. In the aforementioned browsers there is no gap between the two when using a transitional DOCTYPE, but there is when using strict in IE and FF the gap is present on both. I eventually worked out that adding codedisplayblockcode to the img tag stops the gap appearing in all cases which was my objective.p  pa hrefhttpshare.tibstudios.comtransitional.html relnofollowtransitional examplea, a hrefhttpshare.tibstudios.comstrict.html relnofollowstrict exampleap

The problem is not unique to this query, the data dictionary, views or tables as far as I can tell it applies to any set of tables or views from the two or three Ive tried.p  pAnyway, try to run this query and you get ORA00918 because both codeUSERTABLEScode and codeUSERTRIGGERScode have a column called codeSTATUScode so to get the query to run the codeWHEREcode clause needs to be changed to codeTRG.STATUScode.  Ok, cool, but try instead joining another table.p  precodeSELECT  FROM USERTABLES TAB JOIN USERTRIGGERS TRG ON TRG.TABLENAME  TAB.TABLENAME JOIN USERCONSTRAINTS CON ON CON.TABLENAME  TAB.TABLENAME WHERE STATUS  DISABLED codepre  pThis query, without qualifying which STATUS column you mean, magically works  Never mind the semantics or what the query returns, there is no error.  codeUSERCONSTRAINTScode even has a column called codeSTATUScode too, so how come it doesnt know what to do when there are two columns to choose from but its okay with even more ambiguityp  pThis is all on 10.2.0.3.0 by the way, and in essence ORA00918 stops being raised if you have more than two tables in your query.

These tables are critical for activity tracking of certain type of users whos data i need to preserve indefinitely and some are critical lookup tables. So a mixture of system locked values and user tracked values.p  pIdea is if someone wants to destroy the data they need to kill that database. Is there a way to do thisp

Negative 88155 pWhat I currently have is is a multiparty, multichat app P2P at that, which uses the older .NET v2.0 method. Intranet only.p  pWhat Im after is how to dynamically create WCF endpoints versus a static endpoint defined in the config file  I can do the rest. Ill be using a generic message vs. static predefined, so this allows for dynamic message passing.  Ill use the HTTP transport in WCF to send and receive plain old XML POX messages that is, messages that consist solely of XML payloads without any enclosing SOAP envelope.p  pOR should I just assume that the same base port is all that is needed for every workstation and merely use that as the sole port, and that theres no network clash conflict e.g. 2 guest workstations simultaneously communicating with the same host workstationp  pId like to move it to WCF, but the endpoint thing has got me e.g. cant seem to figure it out.p  pHistory My current chat app uses the older .NET v2.0 method.  I have about 50 workstations and each is assigned a static port, e.g. 50100, 50200, 50300, etc.  This allows for up to 99 ports in the range of 50100  50199 port 50100 is the base port, and ports 50101  50199 are host ports which allows up to 99 host chat sessions simultaneously. The workstation can host several chat sessions on, say, ports 50101 thru 50105.  They can also join be a guest on chats within the port range of the other workstations.p  pEach workstation is listening on their base port, e.g. 50100.  When a chat request comes in on their base port, the requesting server provides the dynamically created port to join the chat request as a guest.  In this example, workstation A base port 50100 gets an invite from workstation B to join on port 50235 50200 is Workstation Bs base port for incoming chat requests. BTW I use a web service to track when users are online or not.  The chat app registersunregisters with the web service when openingquitting.p  pCurrent WFC model With WCF, I dont see how this model above can be ported no pun intended into the WCF model.  The config file shows a single port for all workstations.  Can multiple chats occur on the same port, both as host and guest  I would think not.p  pThe short of it being, how could I dynamically create endpoints purely in C code, no static config file endpoint, or can I I cant seem to find any examples.p  pThat is, the base workstation port endpoint will listen for chat requests it will create an endpoint to send a chat request to another workstations base port endpoint, and will create an endpoint when invited to a chat.p  pThx,p  pGaryNp

Negative 88155 pI have been building cubes for the last six month and was doing well until I was approached with a new task. This new task was to setup a cube that uses Teradata as its data source so I get to building the cube and I am able to select a data source and test connection that goes fine. I am able to build a data source view selecting tables from within our teradata infrastructure. I am able to explore the data at the datasource level. So I build the cube and select my measures and build a dimension to go with this cube. so when I go to process this cube I get and Idbconnection error saying that the teradata client has thrown an exception. Keep in mind I am able to right click on the tables in the data source view and explore the data. If anyone has any insight on what I may be doing wrong and if any other information is needed let me know.p

Negative 88155 pImplementing math functions for various things is simple enough. codeint mulint,intcode, codeint  powint,intcode, even codedouble divfloat,floatcode are easy to do and can be implemented with loops or recursion. These are the same methods used to perform these functions by hand or in the head. To multiply, just repeatedly add the number. To divide, repeatedly subtract it. To get the power, repeatedly multiply. And so on.p  pOne mathematical function that Ive always wondered about however is roots. For example, how would you write a function to calculate the square or cube, etc. root of a number ie, codedouble rootfloat num, float rootcode I tried looking around and could not find an algorithm or method of doing this.p  pWhen I try to calculate a root by hand, I usually use the guess method start with an approximate number, add a fraction, multiply, see how far off it is, add a smaller fraction, multiply, check again, and repeat until satisfied. I suppose that could work, but surely there is a betterand fastermethod regardless of how much faster a computer can do it than by hand.p  pObviously LUTs are not relevant since it would have to be generic enough to take any operands unless you are writing a game with a finite set of data. The a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMethodsofcomputingsquareroots relnofollowWikipedia articlea mentions the guess method and lists some ancient ones from long before computers were invented as well as some pure math and even calculus methods including some that have infinity as a component.

And thats just for emsquarerootsem, let alone cuberoots, and such.p  pIs there no easy root calculation method How do calculators do it How do computers do it No, simply doing codedouble powa,0.5code wont work because then how would codedouble powfloat,floatcode be implementedp  pAm I just incorrectly grouping root functions with simpler functions Are they more complex than they seemp

Negative 88155 pIve just been playing with jQuery for a little while  been using YUI for awhile and while I really appreciate a lot of what the jQuery library has to offer, Im finding it to be quite a pain to step through jQuery code in the debugger and Im wondering if there are any tricks other than the obvious thingsp  pTake a simple function like thisp  precodefunction findFirstShortChildparent      var result  null       parent   li.eachfunction          if this.cssheight lt 10              result  this             returnfalse     break out of each function                   returnresult  codepre  pIf the function isnt working as intended and I decide I want to step through it, it is not intuitive at all.  In fact, you cant really step through it at all.  You would have to go through all sorts of jQuery code in a bunch of places.  You cant step into the code.eachcode loop because it isnt actually a traditional loop.  Im surprised at how unproductive I feel in the debugger compared to other libraries.  So, here are my issuesp  ul liYou cant step through line by line or youll end up in a whole bunch of jQuery functions.li liYou cant get into the inside of the each loop without either going through a lot of jQuery stuff or setting a breakpoint and letting it hit the breakpoint.li liYou cant see what any of the intermediate values like this are or why it might be getting a bogus value for the height without stepping through miles of foreign jQuery code.li liYou cant break out of the each loop like you do in a traditional loop with break or return because it isnt an actual loop.  The loop is inside the .each function.  What looks like a loop here is just the internals of a function call.li liWhat if I want to know why Im getting a bogus height value in the loop.  Is there any way to figure that out without stepping through a lot of jQuery codeli ul  pSo, what am I missing here  Is it just a lot less convenient to step through this kind of code  Am I missing some magic techniques built into the jQuery framework to help with this  Or is the price you pay for using this style library that you have to completely change how you debug problems.  p  pIs this what you have to dop  ul liAssign intermediate values to local variables in a trouble spot so you can more easily inspect them without stepping through jQuery functions.li liMove from breakpoint to breakpoint rather than stepping through things a line at a time.li liLearn how to step into and through jQuery calls efficiently to answer some kinds of questions.li ul  pHow do you all do it  What am I missingp  pI should mention that I use Firebug in FF5 and the builtin debugger in Chrome Chrome more often than Firebug now.  And, yes Im using the debug nonminified version of jQuery when debugging.  So, this isnt a question about which debugger you use, but how you use the debugger to effectively step through jQuery code.p

Negative 88155 pI have recently taken a position at a large corporation as a Web Developer for one of the companys divisions. For my first task I have been asked to create a web form that submits data to a database and then outputs the id of that data to the user for reference later. Easy, right Unfortunately not. Because this is a large company that has been around for a long time their systems are relatively antiquated and none of their servers support serverside technologies PHP, ASP etc... and since they are such a large company Corporate IT is pretty much a black hole and there is not any hope of actually getting such tech implemented.p  pSO To my question... is there ANY way to do this without serverside To me the answer is no and I have spent the last week researching on sites like this and others without finding any miraculous work arounds. Really all I have at my disposal are things I can implement without involving IT, so things I can just upload to a webserver.p  pAlso as a note The web server it is on is supposedly an IBM Web Server IHS and the database I am supposed to be connecting to is a MS Access database and the company restricts us to using IE for any web access. As this form is on an internal company INTRAnet site IE is the only browser it will be accessed from.p  pI know this is a ridiculous situation but unfortunately that is what I am stuck with.

Negative 88155 pI have an image on a page. I cannot change the page. When you click on the images this page has, a function run and processes the image. The image is not a button. To make the image respond to clicks, the page developer added a listener to it. In fact, every image on that page has a listener. The listener is listening the img tag.p  pWhen you click on an image, the Javascript checks to see if that image should respond to a click and then runs or not a function.p  pI am developing some automation to fill the form where this image is. This automation script needs to fill the form and click on that image. How do I click on that image using javascriptp  pWhat should I look on the code to discover the method that runs when the image is clickedp  pMy problem is this as the listener is attached to all images on that page but just some respond to the clicks, I suppose that the function attached to the listener has to receive a reference to the image that needed to be process... this is what complicates everything...p  pIf you guys want, I can zip the page and the javascripts and put it here. p  pthanksp

Negative 88155 pIt will use Skypes API or Google TalkVoice. The apps front screen is very simple. The app is meant to be an intercom through skype, so it will have its own skype account and will call another specific skype account.p  pAt the top will be a status bar. It could say Not Connected, Calling, Connected, and No Answer. Below that should be the spot where the video comes in through the skype api. At the bottom should be a Push to Call button and when in the middle of a conversation, a Push to End button. In the bottom right of the screen should be an invisible button to enter the admin backend. When clicked, a passcode will popup set the first time the app is opened.p  pOn the backend, the app will allow the user to enter the apps skype username and password. It will also ask for the skype username it should be contacting. Below that is should ask for an email address. The email address should be used when the app says no answer, an envelope should popup and say Send Message. If the user clicks on it, the app uses the androids default email address to send an email to the email address entered in the admin section. The last part is there should be two boxes on it. If the first one is checked, the front page should remain the same. If the second one is checked, the front page should change a little. Everything should remain the same but shrink a little and at the top should be a search bar and a scrollable list of all the skype users contacts.p  pIf skype wont work, I would want it built through Google TalkVoice.p  pCan I do that using Skype API or Google Talk p

Negative 88155 pIm not really into C design patterns, so my doubt is potentially simple although a little specific. The real application of this question is harder to explain, so let me simplify it.p  pSuppose I have an array, in which I want to store prime numbers. The number of primes this array contains is defined by codeNUMBEROFPRIMEScode, a constant defined at compile time.p  pThus, we havep  precodeunsigned primes[NUMBEROFPRIMES] codepre  pIf the size was fixed, I could precompute the primes and initialize the array as usualp  precodeunsigned primes[NUMBEROFPRIMES]   2, 3, 5, 7, ...  codepre  pBut that would be rather ugly if codeNUMBEROFPRIMEScode were, lets say, greater than 200. I want some way to run a function at runtime, but before main, that will put those primes numbers there. Of course I could dop  precodeunsigned primes  makeprimesNUMBEROFPRIMES codepre  pwhich would allocate the necessary memory and run before main. The main problem is this array would be in a header file, but its value would contain something thats hidden inside the corresponding .c file. what I thought I could do isp  precode Header file  unsigned primes[NUMBEROFPRIMES]   C file  int nothing  initializeprimes  This function would write the  values to the array, using things that are not available in the header it is in the .c, so it can reference them, and return anything  codepre  pAnother way is obviously putting codeinitializeprimescode in the header file, and asking the user to call it inside the main function like some libraries codeinitcode function. However, Id like not to force codemaincode to contain a call to this function.p  pMy question is if there is any elegant way to do this that is universally acceptedused, or if this is ridiculous and I should ask codemaincode to call an codeinitcode function to avoid unnecessary, obscure code.p  pAs I said, Im not working with anything related to primes this is just an example with the same challenge.p  pBest regards.p

Negative 88155 pI am working on a project where I have to use a Fortran library in C. In the Fortran library there is a common block containing a complex16, 4x4 array. Now in C, a complex variable is simply a struct containing two elements and since it is complex16, the elements should be long double, which is the corresponding C data type in Fortran. So I have a struct with two long doubles. p  pI am to access the elements of this array. Good  thing is, I can already do that along with all other common variables of the library. The problem is that elements that I import from the array are,p  p1 Not in the order as the should be, strongeven after taking into account the difference in the array structure of C and Fotranstrong.p  p2 While most elements are right, two are very different from what they should be.  p  p3 I get the right elements except for the two only if I use double instead of long double. When I use long double and the correct character conversions I get something entirely different which clearly points to a problem with conversions. p  pI have exhausted every explaination I had but nothing works. My code for priting arrays in C is the followingp  precodefor j0jlt3j     printfs, n     fork0klt3k                     printfs d s d s s LE s LE s,           , k1, , ,j1, , ,           long doublemssmmixing.neunmx[k][j].dr,            ,           long doublemssmmixing.neunmx[k][j].di,           n                  codepre  pAdditional Info Since I have to mix Fortran Object files, I am using gfortran to compile the C files. If I use GNU C compiler instead, it throws errors about not recognizing gfortran routines. This might also be a source of problem, may be the gfortran does not recognize long doubles in C.p  pAny help will be useful. p

Negative 88155 pI did a test of NFS service over Cisco ASA 5505 firewall.p  pWith normal interface default ACL, which is permit ip any any on inside interface Level 100, deny ip any any on outside interface level 0. NFS server is connected to outside interface. Everything works great. By look at the the packets go through, I can see inside PC call NFS servers 111 port, negotiate  a port using portmap. Finished this TCP connection. Then NFS server outside PC use the negotiated port to connect to inside PC and transfers data. Cisco ASA firewall keep TCP states very well and remembered the negotiated port, thus let outside PC using this port to talk to inside PC even the outside ACL is deny ip any any. The firewall is fully stateful, every thing is great so far.p  pHowever, as long as I connected the NFS server outside PC to Cisco ASA firewall using VPN. Everything changed. By look at the packets, NFS can still go through firewall and negotiate a port by portmap. While after this TCP session is over. Firewall FORGET the negotiated port and block the outside PC using negotiated port to talk back to inside PC.p  pWith or without VPN is the only change. There is just one ACL, on inside interface, permit ip any any. The NFS server is set to can be access from any subnet. There is no NAT and no servicepolicies setup on this firewall.p  pCan anyone please explain why Cisco Firewall rules is not stateful anymore over VPN Is it designed to be What is the best way to let NFS working over VPN without open a range of dynamical ports on outside interfacep

Negative 88155 pIm making a customer administration software. There are several JPanels with much content on it, constantly communicating with a database. In the database is customer data, products etc.br  For a faster access to the database data, at first I load it all in its own ArrayList, e.g. codeArrayListltCustomergtcode. If the user changes this data, it has to be changed in both the class and the database.br  As the JPanel codeViewcode looks very full crammed with other JPanels and JTabbedPanes, switching through with the CardLayout, I thought it would be better to create an own class for every main JPanel and link them all with codeViewcode.br  For example an own class for the JPanel codeCustomercode, where all the customer data can be seen and edited, the same for products etc.br br  Does is make sense or is it inconvinient I only want to do so to outsource the code and to make the classes clearer, especially codeViewcode.br  Is there something like a design pattern dealing with this problemp

Negative 88155 pIm working on an App that has objects that must be available to all instances but also have synchronized access for certain methods within the object.p  pFor instance I have this objectp  precodepublic class PlanetID implements Serializable      public PlanetID          id  0           public long generateID          id         return id           private long id  codepre  pIts a simple object that creates a long id in series. Its necessary that this object generate a unique id every time. At the moment I have a static synchronized method that handles the Datastore access and storage along with the MemCache access and storage. It works for this particular method but I can already see issues with more complex objects that require a user to be able to access nonsynchronized variables along with synchronized variables.p  pIs there some way to make an object global and allow for both synchronized methods and nonsynchronized methods along with the storage of the object when those synchronized objects are accessedp  pEDIT I think people focused too much on the example I gave them and not on the bigger question of having a global variable which can be accessed by all instances and having synchronized access to specific methods while allowing asynchronous access to others.p  pHeres a better example in hopes it makes things a big more clearer.p  pEx.p  precodepublic class Market implements Serializable  public Market      mineral1  new ArrayListltListinggt     mineral2  new ArrayListltListinggt     mineral3  new ArrayListltListinggt     mineral4  new ArrayListltListinggt   public void addListingint mineral, String userID, int price, long amount  Doesnt require synchronized access     switch mineral      case MINERAL1         mineral1.addnew ListinguserID, price, amount         break     case MINERAL2         mineral2.addnew ListinguserID, price, amount         break     case MINERAL3         mineral3.addnew ListinguserID, price, amount         break     case MINERAL4         mineral4.addnew ListinguserID, price, amount         break        public void purchasedint mineral, String userID, long amount  Requires synchronized access     ArrayListltListinggt mineralList  null      switch mineral      case MINERAL1         mineralList  mineral1         break     case MINERAL2         mineralList  mineral2         break     case MINERAL3         mineralList  mineral3         break     case MINERAL4         mineralList  mineral4         break                  Listing remove  null     for Listing listing  mineralList         if listing.userID  userID             if listing.amount gt amount                  listing.amount  amount                 return              else                 remove  listing                 break                   mineralList.removeremove             Collections.sortmineralList   public JSONObject toJSONint mineral  Does not require synchronized access     JSONObject jsonObject  new JSONObject      try          switch mineral          case MINERAL1             for Listing listing  mineral1                 jsonObject.accumulatePlayer.MINERAL1, listing.toJSON             break         case MINERAL2             for Listing listing  mineral2                 jsonObject.accumulatePlayer.MINERAL2, listing.toJSON             break         case MINERAL3             for Listing listing  mineral3                 jsonObject.accumulatePlayer.MINERAL3, listing.toJSON             break         case MINERAL4             for Listing listing  mineral4                 jsonObject.accumulatePlayer.MINERAL4, listing.toJSON             break               catch JSONException e             return jsonObject   public static final int MINERAL1  0 public static final int MINERAL2  1 public static final int MINERAL3  2 public static final int MINERAL4  3  private ArrayListltListinggt mineral1 private ArrayListltListinggt mineral2 private ArrayListltListinggt mineral3 private ArrayListltListinggt mineral4  private class Listing implements Serializable, ComparableltListinggt      public ListingString userID, int price, long amount          this.userID  userID         this.price  price         this.amount  amount           public JSONObject toJSON          JSONObject jsonObject  new JSONObject          try              jsonObject.putUserID, userID             jsonObject.putPrice, price             jsonObject.putAmount, amount          catch JSONException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace                   return jsonObject           Override     public int compareToListing listing          return price lt listing.price  1  price  listing.price  0  1           public String userID     public int price     public long amount  codepre  pp

Could this be something to do with itp  pAlso, as a workaround, I can currently make use of the codecontactSearchProvidercode class to achieve this used by the overview when you intall codegnomecontactscode where you can type the name of a contact and theyll appear in the overview. I basically search for codecode which should return me a list of every contact. It seems roundabout though  I feel I should just be able to use the codegetallcode method to get all the contacts without having to search on an empty string...p  precode    const ContactDisplay  imports.ui.contactDisplay     cds  new ContactDisplay.contactSearchProvider     res  cds.getInitialResultSet[]       woohoo res.length is 31, and res[0], res[1], ... are all not null codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated by the way, is there any sort of documentation about for this I feel extremely inadequate when I stare at the source and try to deduce all the documentation from itp

Negative 88155 pThis is probably a bit of a limited, but valuable scenario. I have a SQL Server 2008 database with a table that has millions of records. There appears to be an intermittent problem with several of the records. Im trying to repro the problem. In an effort to do this, I finally got the ID of an offending record. I would like to generate an INSERT statement associated with this single record in my PROD database. Then I can easily migrate it into my TESTING database in an effort to repro and resolve the problem.p  pBasically, I need to generate a single INSERT statement for a single record from a single table where I know the primary key value of the record.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas of how I can accomplish this Essentially, I want to generate insert statements on a conditional basis.p  pThank youp
Negative 88155 pIm looking for some tips on how best to avoid a deadlock in the following scenario.  I have a custom table set up for our Magento site that stores some details about ordered items and how much the profit margin is.  I listen for the strongsalesorderinvoicesaveafterstrong event and insert rows into the table based on the info in the invoice.  I also compute an estimated profit based on the strongactualshippingcostsstrong field for every product.  Since this is only an estimate, we regularly import a CSV that contains the order number and the actual cost we paid to ship the order.  My code grabs the imported data, recomputes the profit for the items in each of the orders in the CSV, and updates the database table.  I had initially added a couple of columns to the strongsalesflatorderstrong and strongsalesflatorderitemsstrong tables and was storing everything in there rather than having my own custom table.  We started seeing some issues postcheckout for some customers though we couldnt officially attribute them to my code, in addition to some unforeseen issues with configurable products, so I switched to using a custom table.  This gave me the flexibility I needed and fixed my issues with configurable products.  It also does not seem to cause any issues postcheckout.p  pThis was great until the first time I tried importing a CSV of about 3000 order numbers with shipping costs.  The way I do the import is a bit ghetto but its the best way I could find to do it.  There are a few settings for my extension under the system config, one of which is a file import field.  If you select that field and choose a CSV file and click Save on the configuration page it grabs the file, parses it, and does the work to addupdate the necessary rows in my custom table.  Please let me know if you think this is part of the problem and if you have recommendations on what I should do instead i.e. should I be using the Dataflow classes and creating an advanced profile for this.  This takes a significant amount of time...much longer than it used to take when I was adding the data to the salesflatorder and salesflatorderitems tables.  This could be due to extra calculations and locating the parent of any child products...not sure exactly why its slower, but it is.  While this import is running, if a customer places an order, they can and likely WILL get a SQL Deadlock error.p  pMy question if youre still following all this is how to best avoid this.  For new orders, they are only inserts into the table, while the import is updating existing rows.  They should never conflict.  The only thing I can think of is that in my code for inserting the new rows I do attempt to load a record to make sure it isnt in the table already...could this be why its locking  Im not a SQL expert by any stretch, but I did find some information online about the different types of locks and setting priorities.  Is this possible through Magento or the Zend framework and would that helpp  pSorry for the longwinded question.  I hope you can follow it.  If you need more info, Ill do my best.  Posting the code is hard since its in so many different files, but let me know what you need and Ill provide what I can.p  pThanksp

Negative 88155 pemDisclaimer this question is strictly about mysql and database abstraction layers that support it.emp  pThe PHP website notes that using the codemysqlcode functions of PHP is highlighy discouraged. It instead encourages developers to use codePDOcode or codeMySQLicode.p  pHeres my question in regards to mysql, under all the abstraction, are PDO and MySQLi just being a safer, more objectoriented wrapper for the codemysqlcode functionsp  pAnd if thats true, arent frameworks like CodeIgniter and Symfony creating an unnecessary amount of wrappage by putting a layer on top of MySQLi which would then put a layer on top of native PHP codemysqlcodep  pIf it isnt true, I want to know why an experienced developer is discouraged from using codemysqlcode and what codePDOcode and codeMySQLicode actually do under the abstraction.p  pAlso, please dont tell me to go look at the code Will give 100 bounty.p

Negative 88155 pI am an amateur ASP.net developer working on my first job a friends website.  ASP.net v4.0, using VS2010.p  pHis company makes 3D models using a 3D printer.  The website is currently in development but can be found a hrefhttpwww.makemodels.com relnofollowherea.  I would be the first to admit that the code has been a bit rushed and hacked in, but my friend is quite happy with what he has so far.p  pOne of the requirements is that his customers need to be able to upload their model design files, which could be up to 100 MB each or maybe more.  I am struggling to get this to work properly.p  pI started by using the built in codeltaspFileUpload IDFileUpload1 runatserver gtcode tag and an animated gif image, similar to the idea described in a hrefhttpwww.asp.netwebformsvideoshowdoihowdoifileuploadswithanajaxstyleinterface relnofollowJoe Stagners tutoriala  thanks Joe, I like your presentations a lot.p  pThis worked ok for a small test file but doesnt give any indication of upload progress.

So I published it to our host a hrefhttpswww.123reg.co.uk relnofollow123Rega and it didnt work as expected.  The animated gif comes on when the upload starts, but the progress bar doesnt start moving.  The file input control and the submit button in an IFrame that should get disabled as soon as the upload starts take ages to become disabled.  Then the web page just hangs there.  After waiting for a while I clicked the page refresh button.  When the page refreshed it showed that my test file had been uploaded successfully.  I tried a 16 KB file and a 1.6 MB file.p  pSince this worked on my local machine, I suspect that this is happening because our website host 123Reg is using a web farm.p  pAnyway I thought this was going to be easy but it is not, and so I had a look for some opensource upload progress bars.  I had a look at a hrefhttpneatupload.codeplex.com relnofollowNeatUploada but it says By default, NeatUpload wont work properly on a web garden or web farm, and it also says to get it to work on a web farm Specify the same random 32hexdigit decryptionKey attribute in the  section of each servers Web.config.  But I dont think I have access to 123Regs server config files.p  pMy friend has suggested that perhaps we could use a service such as dropbox, but I had a look and I have no idea how to add this to our website.  This might be a good option since they might be optimized for uploads.p  pAny advice or suggestions would be very much appreciated  thanks.p  hr  pEDIT The story so far ... still struggling with this.p  pI looked into using dropbox in detail and other cloud storage providers such as SkyDrive etc.  Seems that these services are designed around providing applications that interact with individual users storage.  I wanted all users to be able to upload files to MY dropbox folder but without sharing customers should not have access to other customers design files.  Anyway I carried on, setup a dropbox account, installed the a hrefhttpsharpbox.codeplex.com relnofollowSharpbox SDKa and reprogrammed my upload code the bit inside the task action.  This seemed to work ok on my local machine, it was a bit slower because it was uploading to the dropbox server I didnt need the Thread.Sleep.  I published the website to the 123Reg server and got a similar, unusable experience as before.p  pSo far I had been testing on IE9, and I just happend to try it out with Chrome and I noticed a funny thing.  Just after clicking the upload button but before the page refreshed Chrome showed an upload  complete dialog in the bottom left.  This ran to 100, then my controls started to show some action before the whole page started to hang again.p  pAccording to MSDN the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.httppostedfile.aspx relnofollowHttpPostedFilea By default, all requests, including form fields and uploaded files, larger than 256 KB are buffered to diskp  pSo does this mean that my Task is being started emafterem the painful part of waiting for the upload which is actually happening between the client and a buffer  If this is the case then it would not make sense to make it more painful by then sending the file off to dropbox right  And my progress bar is tracking the progress of the wrong bitp  pToday I am going to check the error handling of my code since I have a feeling that the reason it is hanging is because it is not recovering from an exception properly.  It certainly feels like I am learning a lot by doing this.p

Negative 88155 pI want to implement a driver in Linux, that has a Ethernet stack but the data going out on hardware will be a serial port. Basically, I want to register my serial port as a Ethernet driver. Does anyone have any idea if this is possible I want to be able to push IPv6 andor UDP packets out of the serial port and in a similar way receive the packets via a serial port and pass it up the Ethernet stack.p  pI do not want to use the solution of serialtoethernet convertorsexternal hardware that convert a serial port to a ethernet port but have that in my PC itself.p  pI tried PPP over the serial port and it works well. I am also told that I can do FTP, HTTP etc using the PPP.

Negative 88155 pI am new to multithreading in Java and dont quite understand whats going on.p  pFrom online tutorials and lecture notes, I know that the codesynchronizedcode block, which must be applied to a nonnull object, ensures that only one thread can execute that block of code. Since an array is an object in Java, synchronize can be applied to it. Further, if the array stores objects, I should be able to synchronize each element of the array too.p  pMy program has several threads updated an array of numbers, hence I created an array of codeLongcode objectsp  precodesynchronized grid[arrayIndex]     grid[arrayIndex]  a.getNumber  codepre  pThis code sits inside the coderuncode method of the thread class which I have extended.

If I click on the text view the click event is called. I am not able to figure why the viewpager in not flipping the pages if the swipe starts from the text view with click event.p  pTo find out the reason for the bug I added a ontouchlistener to the viewpager and found that the touch event of the viewpager is called when the swipe happens on the part of the page where there is no text view and the touch event is not called at all if the swipe starts on top of the text view. If I remove the onclicklistener of the textview then the entire viewpager flips properly without any issue. So the problem is that the click event of the textview is stopping the touch events of the viewpager. Please tell me if I am doing something wrong in my create page code. The view which I create in this function is added to the viewpager through the pageadapter as shown in the tutorial I mentioned in the beginning. p

Negative 88155 pI wonder if it is possible to install a background hadoop cluster. I mean, after all it is meant to be able to deal with nodes being unavailable or slow sometimes.p  pSo assuming some university has a computer lab. Say, 100 boxes, all with upscale desktop hardware, gigabit etherner, probably even identical software installation. Linux is really popular here, too.p  pHowever, these 100 boxes are of course meant to be strongdesktop systems for studentsstrong. There are times where the lab will be full, but also times where the lab will be empty. User data is mostly stored on a central storage  say NFS  so the local disks are not used a lot.p  pSounds like a good idea to me to use the systems as Hadoop cluster in their idle time. The simplest setup would be of course to have a cron job start the cluster at night, and shut down in the morning. However, also during the day many computers will be unused.p  pHowever, how would Hadoop react to e.g. strongnodes being shut down when any user logs instrong Is it possible to easily pause preempt a node in hadoop, and moving it to swap when needed Ideally, we would give Hadoop a chance to move away the computation before suspending the task also to free up memory. How would one do such a setup Is there a way to signal Hadoop that a node will be suspendedp  pAs far as I can tell, datanodes should not be stopped, and maybe replication needs to be increased to have more than 3 copies. With YARN there might also be a problem that by moving the task tracker to an arbitrary node, it may be the one that gets suspended at some point. But maybe it can be controlled that there is a small set of nodes that is always on, and that will run the task trackers.p  pIs it appropriate to just codestopcode the codetasktrackercode or send a codeSIGSTOPcode then resume with codeSIGCONTcode The first would probably give hadoop the chance to react, the second would continue faster when the user logs out soon as the job can then continue. How about YARNp

Negative 88155 pI am using Webkit notifications on my web page to notify users of an update in the page which updates regularly using AJAX. I am using the prefixed emwebkitNotificationsem rather than the nonprefixed version to maintain as much backwards compatibility as possible. I create a notification, retain a reference to it in an elements data using jQuery, add an emonCloseem handler function to it, then show it. The notification appears in the notification centre as it should, and functions properly. If I attach an emonClickem handler to it, that functions as expected also. However, when I dismiss the notification either by clicking close if I have it as an alert, or by clearing it in the notification centre if it is just a banner my emonCloseem handler is not called in Chrome. I still have a reference to the notification on my web page, and if I call the cancel method on it the notification is no longer visible in the notification centre then the emonCloseem handler does get called.p  pAs far as I can tell, this problem is unique to Chrome running on Mountain Lion I havent tested it on previous versions of OSX but I presume that functions in a similar way to Windows, since the notification centre did not exist then. Using Safari on Mountain Lion, the emonCloseem is properly called when dismissing the notification, and it is also called when dismissing the notification from Chrome under Windows.p  pDoes anybody have any idea why this should be so, and if there is some way to correctly receive the emonCloseem eventp  pI have set up a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netAzxC9 relnofollow titlejsFiddlejsFiddlea for people to test this.p  pJust to clarify, Im running version 22.0.1229.79 of Chrome, and the test works on version 6.0.1 of Safari.p

Otherwise                   it will esc KeyTable as well                                   setTimeout function  keys.block  false, 0                                  Dispatch click event to go into edit mode  Saf 4 needs a timeout...          setTimeout function   nCell.click , 0          codepre  pFrom what I can tell, the cell isnt made editable until the return key is hit, after which is now has a click event attached to it. Is there a way for me to attach a click event, in my case I want a dblclick, to the cells before I ever hit return Ive tried binding a function to the td.focus and and example td with no luck. I would like each cell to respond to a dblclick from the load, but also respond to the keys.p

Negative 88155 pIve written an application which listens to a port and receives some packets,according to my customized protocol, the packets are either 49 byte to 1500 byte, which i can tell from data length in the packet. the way i should interpret and deal with data in 49 byte packets and bigger packets are different.p  pThe problem is that when i receive packets less than 1374 byte everything is ok, but when the packet length gets more, i receive the following exception and i also lose 4 last bytes of my dataive tested with a 1384byte packet and i lost the last 4 bytesp  pException which is raised     Index was out of range.

Negative 88155 pI have flexslider set up on a responsive site. The slider I am creating takes both landscape and portrait orientation images. I have codesmoothHeight truecode set so the height adjusts to fit the images.p  pAt the largest media query the flexslider container is 750px wide. This is fine for landscape orientation images but portrait orientation images become way too big. The width of the portrait image gets set to same size as the container  750px wide, and so the height is at least double that and so you cannot view the whole image without scrolling.p  pIn the css I tried setting codemaxheight 750pxcode which solves the height problem but flexslider then stretches the image to fit 750px wide by 750px high.p  pDoes anyone know of any way to get flexslider to preserve the aspect ratio and adjust the width of the image based on the codemaxheightcode So that the portrait images would be 750px high but maintain their aspect ratio.p

Lets say one domain is called mydomain.com, and the other is called yourdomain.com. There is a 2 way trust between both domains, and I have validated that trust.li liI have added some dummy users in mydomain.com and yourdomain.com, some with the same names and some with different onesli ul  pNow, what I want to do is to check which users in mydomain.com exist in yourdomain.com as well.

This is also stated in the a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanxhtmlglBlendFunc.xml relnofollowdocumentation for glBlendFuncap  blockquote   pTransparency is best implemented using blend function GLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA with primitives sorted from farthest to nearest. Note that this transparency calculation does not require the presence of alpha bitplanes in the frame bufferp blockquote  pAnd in the a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgarchivesresourcesfaqtechnicaltransparency.htm relnofollowOpenGL transparency FAQap  blockquote   pWhen using depth buffering in an application, you need to be careful about the order in which you render primitives. Fully opaque primitives need to be rendered first, followed by partially opaque primitives in backtofront order. If you dont render primitives in this order, the primitives, which would otherwise be visible through a partially opaque primitive, might lose the depth test entirely.p blockquote  pBut as the viewing angle can change when I change the render effects codemodelViewMatrixcode, the farthesttonearest order depends on the current viewing angle.p  pIs there a way to have OpenGL automatically render my primitives in the right order, and if not, what would be the best way to proceed I think that calculating the zposition of depending on the current viewing angle and ordering a few thousand triangles for each frame or, more precisely, each time the viewing angle changes, which can be each frame would be too cost intensive, especially as Id need to push this order to the GPU for each frame.p  pNote that Im not concerned with using textures just colored vertices.p

Negative 88155 pI am quite new to web development. I am working on a website hosted on amazon ec2 server. The site is in python using django framework. I am using memcached to cache some client information. My site and caching works on local machine but not on the EC2 server. I checked memcached server and found out that it was not able to set the keys. Is there something I might need to change in settings.py so that keys are set appropriately on the server or something else that I might be missing. p  pEDIT Found out the problem. I added a new middleware for setting keys in the memcache. That is not getting called. It works perfectly on the local machine. On the server I am using gunicorn as the app server and nginx as the reverse proxy. Can any of these cause the problems. Also I tried to reload nginx but that didnt help either. p

Negative 88155 pOne week ago my professor talked about garbage collection and its responsiveness. Basically he said that if you use garbage collection you will always have a very small delay before the code will be executed.p  pNow you can say that the user will not recognize the delay because it is very small.p  pI am working on a game engine for my final bachelor exam and I am currently deciding which scripting language I will choose for my engine.p  hr  pNow I have the following situation.  Lets say you create a game with a first person camera. And lets also say that the gamelogic is written in a language with a garbage collection.p  pstrongWouldnt this imply that the user will encounter more input lag than playing a game where the gamelogic is written in a language without garbage collectionstrongp  pNow input lag is very difficult to predict because there are so many systems that will produce a delay.p  pfor example codeinput gt gamecode executing gt  graphics rendering gt rendering on the screencode.p  pstrongIs it roughly predictable how much delay I will have If I use a language with gc vs a language without gcstrong  codelt1ms, lt10ms lt100mscodep
Negative 88155 pOk, Im a bit new to iOS programming, and Im not too sure how to phrase the question but hopefully someone could point me in the right direction. Im trying to create something like a news app. The interface would be entirely large image tiles, some larger, some smaller, with a title over each image. Now is it sensible to create a couple of those tiles with images and titles in interface builder and then in the app just loop them for a couple of times for every category that i have in my JSON array.p  pFor example Id have 3 tiles for Sports, then 3 tiles for Politics etc etc.p  pIs this accaptable way of doing things or should I do everything programmaticalyp  pThanks for any help, hopefully the question made sense.p

Negative 88155 pI have a singleton service class on IIS as part of a web application the service to be a singleton for data caching reasons. Browser clients that make requests to the service can have one of three results p  p1 There is data in the cache and the data is not expired stale  we return this data. Very fast.  2 The cached data is expired, but another request is already querying the database. We returned the cached data.  3 The cached data is expired and no requests are making queries to the DB. This request moves forward to make the query. p  pHowever, database queries that target stored procedures with the same name have to be queued requirement. p  pThus, I wrote this queue class that is designed to queue these queries and run them consecutively, instead of concurrently. These queue classes are created as needed and stored in a list in the singleton class. When a request moves to part 3, it finds the queue class that matches its stored procedure name and submits the request to the queue class. It then waits until the data is returned from the DB so it can service the HTML request. p  pUnfortunately, after a few hours with this code in place, the server process maxes at 100. p  pI am not sure what the best way is to go about improving it, because multithrread coding is not my specialty. p  pThe queue class code looks like this p  precodepublic ReportTable GetReportTableReportQuery query    lock queue        queue.Enqueuequery     Monitor.Pulsequeue       lock queue        var firstQueryInQueue  queue.Peek     while inUse  firstQueryInQueue  null  firstQueryInQueue.GetHashCode  query.GetHashCode            Monitor.Pulsequeue       Monitor.Waitqueue           inUse  true     firstQueryInQueue  queue.Dequeue     var table  firstQueryInQueue.GetNewReportTable     inUse  false      Monitor.Pulsequeue     return table     codepre

Negative 88155 pI am writing a program for Windows that eventually has to launch a different preexisting .exe that sits on the same computer. It passes multiple parameters to this .exe file. I am reading the actual command and parameters and constructing the command but I also tried hard coding it with the same results. Heres the hard coded version I picked this out of an older C program that uses the same.exep  pcodesystemcIQapturedmon26IHD p2 cIQapturemontable101Tx8.txt 11 0 0codep  pSo in the original program inside codeint cdecl mainint argc, charargvcode this use of system works. In my C program inside a C class method when I issue the command the correct program launches but it immediately puts up an error dialog stating that an error has occurred. I echod the system string used to launch the exe out to the console. Right after it fails, I copy and paste the same line that was echod and this time the exe runs without error. This is repeatable. In case it was timing related I tried adding a 10 second delay before issuing the system command but it didnt matter. Plus the original older program doesnt require a delay. This implies to me that the string is correct and the target program works. Somehow the system invocation is different from a direct command line invocation. The program compiles and builds fine. Im using Visual Studio 2010.p  pDoes anyone have ideas on how to make the system invocation work like the command line invocation p

Negative 88155 pI have a working Java program that uses the Tanuki wrapper.  The problem I have is that the wrapper log file is not UTF8 encoded, but appears to be ASCII.  The wrapper configuration file begins withp  precodeencodingUTF8 include ....Tomcatconfwrapperlicense.conf wrapper.java.command.loglevelINFO wrapper.lang.encodingUTF8 wrapper.debugtrue codepre  pThe wrapper starts and it starts the JVM successfully.  But when I edit the wrapper logfile, Japanese characters for example are present as question mark characters, i.e., ASCII character 0x3f.  I doublechecked by loading the log file in a hex editor.p  pThe Tanuki Wrapper log file is put into a directory that contains Japanese characters  for testing purposes.  The log file is successfully created in that folder, so the wrapper is clearly able to read and process the UTF8 characters.  But when it logs the folder name in which it will create its logs, the folder name is logged as all ASCII 0x3f characters .p  pHow can I get the Tanuki Wrapper to encode its log file in UTF8p

Negative 88155 pIm consuming a WCF service in my project for which Ive added the reference using Add Service Reference.... I expected it to generate a clean proxy with a ServiceClient entity and  the Interface. Instead, I see that it has created a MethodNameRequest, MethodNameRequestBody, MethodNameResponse, MethodNameResponseBody entities for each OperationContract method.p  pSo while invoking the service methods, the proxy passes to the service method an instance of MethodNameRequest with the input parameters of the method as the properties of the RequestBody. See below an example of a call to AboutInformationGet method which doesnt accept any parameters.p  precode        public WCFDynamicInvocation.PostingService.AboutModel AboutInformationGet          WCFDynamicInvocation.PostingService.AboutInformationGetRequest inValue  new WCFDynamicInvocation.PostingService.AboutInformationGetRequest         inValue.Body  new WCFDynamicInvocation.PostingService.AboutInformationGetRequestBody         WCFDynamicInvocation.PostingService.AboutInformationGetResponse retVal  WCFDynamicInvocation.PostingService.IMIGQPostingthis.AboutInformationGetinValue         return retVal.Body.AboutInformationGetResult      codepre  pI believe this behavior is what one would expect to see in a Webservice Proxy. Hence I suspect that the WCF service is not properly configured.p  pDid someone here face this issue What would be the change to be done at the service so that the proxy generated is similar to the WCF service.p  pCheers.p

Negative 88155 pIm trying to wrap my head around how to design a RESTful API for creating object graphs. For example, think of an eCommerce API, where resources have the following relationshipsp  pstrongOrder the main objectstrongp  ul liHasmany Addressesli liHasmany Order Line items what does the order consist ofli liHasmany Paymentsli liHasmany Contact Infoli ul  pThe Order resource usually makes sense along with its associations. In isolation, its just a dumb container with no business significance. However, each of the associated objects has a life of its own and may need to be manipulated independently, eg. editing the shipping address of an order, changing the contact info against an order, removing a lineitem from an order emafterem it has been placed, etc.p  pThere are two options for designing the APIp  ul liThe Order API endpoint intelligently creates itself AND its associated resources by processing nested resource in the content sent to codePOST orderscodeli liThe Order resource only creates itself and the client has to make followup POST requests to newly created endpoints, like codePOST orders123addressescode, codePUT orders123lineitems987code, etc.li ul  pWhile the second option is simpler to implement at the serverside, it makes the client do extra work for 80 of the usecases.p  pThe first option has the following open questionsp  ul liHow does one communicate the URL for the newly created resource The codeLocationcode header can communicate only one URL, however the server wouldve potentially created multiple resources.li liHow does one deal with errors What if one of the associons has an error Do we reject the entire object graph How is that error communicated to the clientli ul  pWhats the RESTful  pragmatic way of dealing with thisp

Negative 88155 pI have a silverlight user control where I have a textbox and a button.

Negative 88155 pI am working on a simple iPhone app that is loading data from the web service RSS feed inside UITableView. The first time app is loading, i am using a counter with initial value of 1 to load the first page of the feedp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     counter  1         [self fetchEntriesNewcounter]   codepre  pWhen the user scrolls down to the bottom of tableview, i am using the following method to load more data in the tableview by fetching the next page of rss feed by incrementing the counterp  precode voidscrollViewDidEndDeceleratingUIScrollView scrollView      float endScrolling  scrollView.contentOffset.y  scrollView.frame.size.height     if endScrolling gt scrollView.contentSize.height                     NSLogScroll End Called         counter         [self fetchEntriescounter]       codepre  pThe counter is incrementing each time user scrolls down to the bottom of tableview, hence calling the next page of the rss feed. To this point, everything is working fine.p  pBUT, if the user after reaching at the bottom, scrolls up multiple times, the counter also gets incremented multiple times, hence a different page of the rss feed is reached and added to the bottom of the tableview.p  pTo be more precise, if the user has reached to the bottom and scrolled up 3 times, instead of loading the second page, it will load the fourth page 3 times scrolled plus 1 already added in the startp  pstrongHow can i restrict to not add another page entries if the one before it was not loadedstrongp  pKindly do not suggest alternative strategies for handling more rows at the bottom of tableview or any third party libraries like NMPaginator and PartialTable etc. Thanks in advancep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI have closely observed the app by running it again and again. It seems like if the user scrolls to the bottom that increments the counter before tableview is finished loading the page data including images that is already requested, it will just ignore loading the one that is currently loading and start loading the next one based on the incremented counter.p

Negative 88155 pI have a couple security questions on the OAuth 2.0 User Credential Grant type and possible security attacks. So from what I understand so far, when I exchange my users username password client ID and client secret for an access token over HTTPS that is completely safe. Now say for an example if I have a first party mobile application for a service that is doing the user authentication and I keep the access token on the device.p  ol liIf the access token is compromised some how the compromised access token can be used to make subsequent requests to say for example the API service. Is there any way to prevent this other than just not getting the access token out thereli liIf your doing all API requests over HTTPS I shouldnt have to be worried what so ever about the access token being compromised over the wire or have to worry about any replay attacksli ol  pSo basically my concerns about possible security flaws with this specific type of grant. Im pretty sure if the access token doesnt get compromised and all traffic is over SSL it should be fine.p  pId love to hear someones expert opinion not the biggest OAuth person.p

I need to prevent the field labels textboxes being edited, but I cant use the Allow Edits [No] property of the subform because that locks the dropdown and prevent the field labels being changed and I cant lock the specific field label textboxes, because they need to change when a new value is chosen in the drop down list.p  pAny suggestions I rarely use Access or VBA, so am a bit stumped.

Negative 88155 pI have a form with many fields which I post back using the standard form tagp  precodeusing Html.BeginFormSubmitForm, ControllerName, FormMethod.Post      fields and submit button  codepre  pAlso on my form I have a grid which lists contractors, and I have a a button which adds contractors to the list. The way I do it is to create the button as a submit and use the form submit action to do the work. Im pretty sure this isnt the best way to go about it. Heres is the action on the controllerp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult SubmitFormstring btnSubmit, SupplySelectionViewModel model      switch btnSubmit              case addContractor              if model.ContractorId gt 0                              add contractor to parent record and reload whole page                  return RedirectToActionEdit, new  id  model.ProposalId                           else                              ModalState.AddModelErrorSelect a contractor                  Return view with error                 return ViewEdit, model                       case save              if ModelState.IsValid                              Save whole model and redirect back to home page                           Return to view with validation erros             return ViewEdit, model       codepre  pAs you can see I use the name of the button to decide what to do add contractor or submit the form. What I would like is to have the add contractor as an actionlink and post to a separate action. How would I do this without passing the whole model back as I add a model error if no contractor has been selected I know I could do the validation using jquery but lets just say I want to keep all validation server side for now.p

But if I remove the commit method the bookmark and tags still get inserted. But their is no insert to the junction table.

Negative 88155 pIm working on an application that uses a scroll load system of 20 or so results loading into a feed at a time as you scroll. This feed consists of constantly added user generated content. Which means the result set can change per query that is offset by X.p  pSo lets say we load 20 results, then scroll, another 20, and then before scrolling more to load the next 20, another user has uploaded a new piece of content, which effectively would present a duplicate in the next set of 20 results for the feed because were using OFFSET to get additional results, and the total result set is getting shifted by 1 with this addition of new content that falls into the conditions of the query.p  pWhat is the best and most efficient way around this Weve dabbled with using the id of a row in a where condition to prevent duplicate results, and only using limit without offset for new results fetched.. so we could do WHERE id lt 170 LIMIT 20, WHERE id lt 150 LIMIT 20, WHERE id lt 130 LIMIT 20, etc.. to control and prevent duplciates... HOWEVER, this does not work in every possible scenario as our result sets arent always ordered with the id column ordered by DESC..p  pSoo.. what other options are there..p

Negative 88155 pIm new to CodeIgniter but want to perform best practices from the start.  I have a simple authorization call that needs to be able to be called from several controllers.  Hence Im thinking it should be placed in either a library or a helper function.  The call would take the users id and a required authorization level, grab their information from the DB, make sure they have that level of access, and return true or false.p  pLets say authuser,5p  pMy first instinct is to make this a library, but it seems odd to place it directly in a library because there are DB calls, which I would think should go in a model.  It appears that only the Session library contains calls directly to the DB for when database session storing is turned on.p  pSo, I could access the DB directly within the library, or try to link to an external Model.  Looking it up on the web, Im only finding people who have trouble with both routes.  Before I dive too deeply into getting one of them to work, Id appreciate any opinions out there on how to go about this.p  pThanks, Jeremyp

The problem that i am facing is that the signatures of the Encrypt and Decrypt methods in asp vs C are different. here is my asp code for decrypting, which wraps the decrypt code.p  precodeFunction AESDecryptsCypher  if sCypher ltgt  then      Dim bytIn     Dim bytOut     Dim bytPassword     Dim lCount     Dim lLength     Dim sTemp     Dim sPassword      sPassword  MyPassword      lLength  LensCypher     ReDim bytInlLength21     For lCount  0 To lLength21         bytInlCount  CByteampH amp MidsCypher,lCount21,2     Next     lLength  LensPassword     ReDim bytPasswordlLength1     For lCount  1 To lLength         bytPasswordlCount1  CByteAscBMidsPassword,lCount,1     Next      bytOut  DecryptDatabytIn, bytPassword   this is the problem child      lLength  UBoundbytOut  1     sTemp       For lCount  0 To lLength  1         sTemp  sTemp amp ChrbytOutlCount     Next      AESDecrypt  sTemp  End if  End Function codepre  pHowever, in c i am struggling to convert this function because the c equivalent of DecryptData has more paramsp  precodepublic static byte[] DecryptDatabyte[] message, byte[] password,              byte[] initialisationVector, BlockSize blockSize,              KeySize keySize, EncryptionMode cryptMode         ... codepre  pwhat values can i use for initialisationVector, blockSize, keySize, cryptMode so as to be able to decrypt the same way the classic asp code does.p
Negative 88155 pIt is so great that code completion is already there but two things are also important to have 1 refactoring  renaming all the incidents of same variable function  2 when you select a variable it  to highlight all the occurrences of that variable p  pI wonder if the 1,2 are available yet as I need a JavaScript IDE to have both plus codecompletion. I badly searched for all three Eclipse too. but then Eclipse doesnt have codecompletionp

Negative 88155 pIve seen many examples looping through array using foreach and implode function to build sql string for MySQL Insert query.

The stack is just next to the part of uboot which begins at TEXTBASE, then the volume would be calculated to determine the highest address of stack since this part goes down. Is that right    p  pI mean isnt that too simple for the term of set up stack because it is so necessary for running C programs.p

Negative 88155 pI am overriding the codeequalscode method in a Java class and found a conundrum that I cant explain. p  pThe standard codeequalscode contract states thisp  ul liIt is reflexive for any reference value x, x.equalsx should return true.li liIt is symmetric for any reference values x and y, x.equalsy should return true if and only if y.equalsx returns true.li liIt is transitive for any reference values x, y, and z, if x.equalsy returns true and y.equalsz returns true, then x.equalsz should return true.li liIt is consistent for any reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equalsy consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified.li liFor any nonnull reference value x, x.equalsnull should return false.li ul  pTherefore, the standard codeequalscode method would be constructed like sop  precodepublic boolean equalsObject other      if null  other return false     if this  other return true     if other instanceof MyClassName return false     MyClassName that  MyClassName other     return this.myMemberVariable.equalsthat.name  codepre  pGiven class codeFoocode and and class codeBar extends Foocode, both with a member variable codeString bazcode, the standard codeequalscode method inside codeFoocode looks likep  precodepublic boolean equalsObject other      if null  other return false     if this  other return true     if other instanceof Foo return false     Foo that  Foo other     return this.baz.equalsthat.name  codepre  pWhereas the standard codeequalscode method inside codeBarcode looks likep  precodepublic boolean equalsObject other      if null  other return false     if this  other return true     if other instanceof Bar return false     Barthat  Bar other     return this.baz.equalsthat.name  codepre  pIf I had objects codeFoo foo  new FooTestcode and codeBar bar  new BarTestcode, and I called codefoo.equalsbarcode, this would return codetruecode. If I called codebar.equalsfoocode, by the symmetric clause of the codeequalscode contract, this is broken because inside codeequalscode of codeBarcode, codeother instanceof Barcode is codetruecode, making codeBarcodes codeequalcode method return codefalsecode, which isnt correct, it should be codetruecode, by logic both objects codeString bazcode are equal to each other, and by the symmetry clause, where if codex.equalsycode, codey.equalsxcode is inherently codetruecode.p  pIm aware of the codegetClasscode vs codeinstanceofcode argument for overriding codeequalscode and dont want another one of these arguments.p  pThis brings me to my actual question.

Negative 88155 pI am in the process of refactoring a c OpenGL app I made technically, an app that makes heavy use of the thin OpenGL wrapper in Qts QQuickItem class. My app is performing ok but could be better.p  pOne of the issues Im curious about relates to the use of codevirtualcode functions in very timesensitive frame rate algorithms. My OpenGL drawing code calls many codevirtualcode functions on the various objects that need drawing. Since this happens many times per second, I am wondering if the codevirtualcode dispatch could bring down the frame rate.p  pI am thinking about changing to this structure instead which avoids inheritance by keeping everything in one base class, but where the previously codevirtualcode functions now simply contain codeswitchcode statements to call the appropriate routine based on the classs type which is really just a codetypedef enumcodep  pPreviouslyp  precodestruct Base   virtual void a0   virtual void b0   struct One  public Base   void a...   void b...  codepre  pConsideringp  precodestruct Combined    MyEnumTypeDef t essentially holds what type of object this is    void a      switch t       case One        ....        break        case Two        ....        break              codepre  pWhen function codeacode is called very often in OpenGL drawing routines, I am tempted to think that the codeCombinedcode class will be considerably more efficient since it does not require the dynamic dispatch on virtual tables.p  pId appreciate some advice on this issue, if this is wise or not.p

Negative 88155 pI am new to SI. I am using the code from the SI TCP Multiplexing example as a starting point for an app server I am writing. The caller of the service already exists and will be sending the payload prefixed by a byte length header. I am having a bit of trouble with the correlation of the response. As you can see below, I changed the Multiplexing example to first add a correlation id header to the incoming request before pushing on to the publishsubscribechannel. The rest of the code is pretty much the same as the example.p  pSo, the problem. The correlation id header is not available on the call to MessageController from the TcpSendingMessageHandler which serializes the message payload and sends it. Should I enrich the payload to include the correlation id no correlation header or is there a simpler way of doing all of this  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. p  precodeltgateway idgw       serviceinterfaceis.point.tokens.server.MessageGateway       defaultrequestchannelinputgt ltgatewaygt  ltiptcpconnectionfactory idclient             typeclient             hosttcpClientServer.address             porttcpClientServer.port             singleusefalse             serializerbigEndianFormatSerializer             deserializerbigEndianFormatSerializer             sotimeout10000gt  ltchannel idinput datatypejava.lang.Stringgt  ltheaderenricher inputchannelinput outputchannelenriched.inputgt      ltcorrelationid expressionheaders[id]gt ltheaderenrichergt  ltpublishsubscribechannel idenriched.inputgt  ltiptcpoutboundchanneladapter idoutAdapter.client                                      order2                                      channelenriched.input                                      connectionfactoryclientgt lt Collaborator gt  lt Also send a copy to the custom aggregator for correlation and      so this messages replyChannel will be transferred to the      aggregated message.

Negative 88155 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY52Ce.jpg altThis is how the program should be p  pBut I cannot quite seem to figure out what the problem is. The assignment wants me to create a phishing scanner that will assign a point value to each based on my estimate of its likeliness to be in a phishing message. Write an application that scans a file or text for the terms and phrases. For each occurence of a keyword or phrase within the text file, add the assigned point value for the total points for that word or phrase. For each keyword or phrase found, output one line with the word or phrase, the number of occurences and the point total.

The minimum sizes of the  QWidgets are 350x200, 200x100, and 450x450.p  pSo the problem Im having is when I resize the QStackedWidget, it has a minimum size of the largest QWidget within it. So if I switch to the second QWidget, which is the QWidget with the size of 200x100, the QStackedWidget will only size down 450x450 because of the largest QWidget inside of it.

So I have values ranging from E3E210 and if I add or change a value at E211. I want it to automatically sort that range E3E210 or if I change a value at E205. I also want it to go to the cell that it was sorted to if possible. So If I add a value at E211 and it sort to lets say E150.

Negative 88155 pI need to be able to globally replace certain data in django results and perform operations on it.p  pI already have a custom manager doing exclusions based on another database eg CRMData.filteredobj which works fine however I have instances requiring certain things to be grouped, I then need to perform totalscounts of the new grouping for example I get a result using annotateCountname egp  pPizza 20 Beer 5 Tea 3 Nerds 2p  pAnd for example I need to combine Pizza and Beer so the list becomes Beer amp Pizza 25 Tea 3 Nerds 2 Banana 1p  pAnd the list must now be populated with the next highest number.p  pIve attempted doing something likep  precodeCRMData.objects.extraselectname1 case name where Beer OR Pizza then Beer amp Pizza else name codepre  pWhich outputs a result with the extra column but I cannot perform p  precodeCRMData.objects.extraselectname1 case name where Beer OR Pizza then Beer amp Pizza else name.valuesname1.annotateCountname1 codepre  pAs I get ap  precodeCannot resolve keyword name1 into field codepre  pIve tried a few different things like adding .groupby to the end but I still get the same error.p  pIdeally I want to be able to transact using the queryset methods as theres a lot of preexisting code built around it, the goal is to add this as a custom manager method that preceeds other methods but Im not sure if this is possible.p  pIve toyed with the idea of placing the results into a panda dataframe and using that but if anyone has any suggestions if this isnt possible Id be grateful although it will mean a lot of rewriting of code.p  pThanks in advancedp
Negative 88155 pI recently installed  codemcryptcode into the default installation of PHP in OS X 10.9 after getting everything configured and installed, I went to turn on the so in the codephp.inicode. I noticed that there wasnt a default codephp.inicode so I copied the codephp.ini.defaultcode, renaming it, adding the codeextensionmcrypt.socode and restarting Apache.p  pUpon doing this my codephpinfocode page shows nothing, and none of my php scripts work.p  pI can run codephp icode from the command line and see what should be displayed in the codephpinfocode, the codecryptcode library shows up there, and there are no errors.p  pIf I remove all codephp.inicode files from codeetccode or codeprivateetccode, and restart Apache, PHP starts working again.p  pLooking at the codephpinfocode, it shows codeetccode as the location of the codephp.inicode file. Is there some default location that codephp.inicode gets an ini file when one is missingp  pI assume it must be something in the codephp.inicode that is causing an error and keeping php from working, but using the default ini file causes the same result.p

Negative 88155 pI want to write a single codebase plugin that works with both codeNode.jscode and codebrowsercode. I am writing the base code in Node.js and then converting it to have support for browser version using the node module codebrowserifycode. All my codeGETcode and codePOSTcode requests works fine when I execute the code in codeNode.jscode. If I write the codeajaxcode request, its works fine for browser. I am using codehttpcode node module for making request to remote server. How can I make the remote server request work in browser version without writing any separate codeajaxcode request The main idea is to keep the same codebase and get it to work in both ways. I have the following sample code written in Node.jsp  precodevar http  requirehttp  function Test      var self  this   Test.prototype.getdata  function      var fetch  http.requesthttpstackoverflow.com, functionres          var result           res.ondata, functionchunk              result  chunk                  res.ondata, functionchunk              console.logresponse.................             console.logresult                   fetch.onerror, functione          console.logerror..........         console.loge          fetch.end     return hello world   API  new Test  module.exports  API codepre  pNow when I execute the code in codeNode.jscode by calling codeAPI.getdatacode, it works fine for me. But after I convert the code using codebrowserifycode and then call from the codeHTMLcode file by codeAPI.getdatacode I get the following error codeXMLHttpRequest cannot load httpstackoverflow.com. Origin httplocalhost is not allowed by AccessControlAllowOrigin.code when I run in chrome. Any idea how to make the same codeNode.jscode codebase work without writing codejsonp ajaxcode for browser.

Negative 88155 pI currently have a VS installation with no extensions to see how that works out. For navigation that means making heavy use of codeCtrlcode aka codeSearch Solution Explorercode. While the search itself is ok, it has one major drawback for me that makes it a pain to use for me both with keyboard and mousep  pSolution with two projects, one collapsed, one openedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comH4QMB.png altenter image description herep  pUse codeCtrlcode and start typing until match found from collapsed projectp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comH2u6p.png altenter image description herep  pWhat I want now is to simply clear the search and return to the previous view. Seems like a pretty standard requirement, no But there seems to be no such functionality built in. Problem with the current commands that come close pressing codeEsccode, clicking codeBackcode or codeHomecode buttons in Solution Explorer Toolbar is all the same they have the extremely annoying behaviour that they insist on suddenly uncollapsing the previously collapsed project and track the match found Btw the codeTrack Active Item in Solution Explorercode option is turned of in the options. This makes no sense from a UX point of view You select some kind of undo command, the search box clears which is expected, but then suddenly theres an item visible from a previous searchp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combEwTQ.png altenter image description herep  pSo if the collapsed project has like 50 items in it, solution explorer is now useless visually since it litters the screen with stuff you dont want to see, and worse you have to manually collapse the project again to return to the previous view.p  pIs there a way around this I thought maybe keyboard shortcuts for BackHome would be different, but the commands do not seem to be registered. I looked into codeEnvDTE80.DTE2.ToolWindows.SolutionExplorercode but it has no propertiesmethods that have anything to do with this issue. And somewhere in the tree there is a codeMicrosoft.VisualStudio.PlatformUI.SolutionPivotNavigatorcode which is probably the class responsible for this behaviour, but I have no idea how to access itp

Or overriding codeonPostExecutecode from the calling codeActivitycode, and so on, and so on. p  pNow, strongin terms of memory consumption and speed of executionstrong, which approach is the BEST to usep  pstrongNOTEstrong If we take the rating of SO experts, I saw that guys with 20k rating suggest either codeMessagecode or codeInterfacebasedcode approaches.

Negative 88155 pIm trying to create a walker in WordPress that will display categories in a particular structure.

Instead, Im looking to create a menu thats hardcoded in my header.php file. My main reason for this is so that any new categories I add will automatically be shown if they have posts assigned to it. From my understanding, If I were to use the AppearanceMenus section inside WP Admin then Id have to enter the menu and add any new categories each time I create them.p  pFrom the above, Im not sure how to tackle the fact that I need to show only some Pages home, about, contact but show all Categories that have posts and in the format as shown in my code.p  pAny input would be appreciated.p  pThanks, Jamesp

Negative 88155 pI am building an application to do some image analysis tasks. I need to be able to do some image manipulations i.e. rotate, zoom, change center point, etc. in order to get a specific section of the image to do the analysis on. I am using wxPython for my gui so the image being displayed needs to be of type wxImage to scale and then convert to wxBitmap. My image data, though, is a 2D array of floats. In order to create a wxImage the data needs to be in RGBA format. So, right now, I am converting the image to RGBA and doing the rotations with scipy.interpolate.rotate, zoom by cropping the image, etc. and save all the information for the section I want. I then perform the same operations, with the newfound parameters, on the original float array data once the section has been found. p  pSo, the problem is, rotating the RGBA image is incredibly slow since the images are around 2000x2000, even using next door neighbor NDN interpolation mode0. When I interpolate the float array for the analysis, the speed isnt too bad as long as I use NDN or linear. p  pMy questions, then, arep  ol liIs there a better way of doing this without all of the data conversionsli liIf not, then is there a faster way to rotate the RGBA data The quality is not a huge concern since I am only displaying the data and finding parameters I use the untouched float array for analysis. li ol  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 88155 pI have a client that is a minor, local government agency that tasked us with building two WordPress based sites. Upon completion of the first, an issue arose when they logged into the site at their offices.  p  pstrongWhen logged into the WordPress dashboard, none of the built in font icons are workingstrong.  This includes the WYSIWIG editor, the toolbar on the left hand side of the dashboard, and every other place that these icons are used. p  pThe browsers the client has available are FF 17 and IE 9, with preference given to IE 9.  In either case, the font icons are not showing.  Worse, in FF they have JavaScript disabled, which has further ramifications.  p  pUpon further investigation, my team and I have come under the impression that they have certain security settings enabled that disallow the downloading of fonts.p  pAccording to their IT professionals,  they are following National Guidelines that prevent them from changing any security settings, andor installing or updating any browsers.p  pMy goal is to find some kind of work around for this issue, such as a fallback imageicon that will load in place of the fonticons.  Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

It needs to output data coming from another class.p  pThe solution Ive found right now is have a Printer class a test replacer for the actual outputting class with a emqueueem attribute.

Negative 88155 pI am reading security concepts of WCF in Programming WCF Services book. In that i got points like generally transport security is good for intranet scenarios because of pointpoint etc.p  pFor internet scenarios, we can use message security as the better choice. I already worked at basic level in REST based wcf. So i use webHttpBinding. As i knew that the Message security is based on WS standards and the webHttpBinding is rest based it is not possible to apply Message security in the webHttpBinding. p  pBut if take a scenario like i am creating a public API for internet in REST wcf as the methods are used in handheld devices also.

Negative 88155 pI have a class basically a linked list,  so lets call it codeListcode that uses another class to store data the nodes, so lets call the class codeNodecode. codeNodecode has methods that must be called from codeListcode, but calling them from elsewhere could be messy. I need other parts of my program to use references of codeNodecode, but to change them only through codeListcode.br In C I would create another class lets call it codeOpaquecode that has a private pointer to codeNodecode and expose some members of codeNodecode, and if this was passed to codeListcode, the pointer to the actual codeNodecode would be unpacked and used internally, but in C I have not thought of a way to hide the reference to the codeNodecode from the rest of the program without also makking it inaccessible to codeListcode.br Is there any way to do it or some Cspecific idiom that has the same functionalityp  pCLARIFICATION I would like to make it visible to the codeListcode class only. I already know about the codeinternalcode keyword.p

Place this update statement in a stored procedure, and such logging goes away.  br br I know there are system variables such as SET SERVEROUTPUT ON, SPOOL, etc. that can be used along with DBMSOUTPUT.

Negative 88155 pFor the project i am working on i have a slave device that communicates using modbus protocol.  All i need to do is be able to read the holding registers on the device via modbus RTU.  The device has an RS485 output.  I have already purchased an RS485 to usb converter cable that include an FTDI chip.  And also a usb to micro usb cable to connect that to the tablet.  So far i have been able to write a simple java program in netbeans to connect through the usb port on my laptop and read data from the holding registers on the device.  So i do not have a problem with communicating with modbus.p  pThe problem i am having is with sending the modbus communication through the micro usb port.  My tablet is set up as a host, and i have been able to recognize that a device is attached.  I am also able to connect to the port that the device is attached to. Im just getting very confused on how to use the micro usb protocol to send modbus communication over. The code i have for modbus on my laptop just needs a port number to communicate through, but i dont think it is that simple with an android tablet. I have been going through this a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivityusbhost.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivityusbhost.htmla and understand for the most part what is going on, but i cant figure out how to use this information to send modbus communication over.  any help would be great p

Negative 88155 pMy main problem I cant phrase this in a SQL  Access formatted question...p  pI have my primary table X which has all of my VM information.  X then left joins the VMs to a table containing storage, call it Y.  Y then left joins that storage to a disk called Z. That gives me an entry for every time there is a row in X  every row in Y  every row in Z.  But Y may link to multiple values in X.  Thus it could appear more than one, just not more than one of the same value in X.  Does that make sensep  pThen I have a separate table which also joins off of X.  This table has application information for the VMs.  I am trying to LJ A onto X, providing even more duplicates.  The ideal solution is to build an application where you can run another query but I dont have that option.  Is what Im trying to do possible in Microsoft Access Or any DBp

Negative 88155 pI use a JSON API to get data for a website. I am aware of various methods that I could make it secure, but my situation is different from common methods.p  pBecause of cross domain issues, I had to create an API folder with various PHP files that do cURL requests to the REStful API. I then request these local PHP files through AJAX on my site. On the next release it should be JSONP to avoid this issue.p  pMany of these JSON requests contain sensitive information so the first thing I did was check for the HTTP Referrer so people dont just grab the URL when inspecting the JavaScript code and try to run it on their browser. This is obviously not safe nor should I rely on it.p  pAny data I may try to post to the request will be through JavaScript so something like an API key or token would be visible and would defeat the whole purpose.p  pIs there a way I can prevent these PHP files to be run outside the website or something Basically make them inaccesible for visitorsp

Negative 88155 pIm working on custom value picker inspired by UIPickerView. It looks like that img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIMmFv.png altTechnical prototype screen 1p  pAs you can see, one of the main features of this picker is the central cell the should be wider than others to make its neighbours visible beside of the central frame. When you scroll the picker with a pan gesture it should dynamically change central value and adjust cells according to the logic above. And it works just perfect img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdOc3i.png altTechnical prototype screen 2p  pThe problem is in the tap gesture. When the user select any item on the picker by performing tap on it the picker trying to scroll to that item. But since its offset was changed by the custom layout UIScrollView scrolls to the wrong point. And it looks like that img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPHegA.png altTechnical prototype screen 3p  pWhen I trying to scroll to the offscreen cell all things works fine  that cell was not affected by the layout and its coordinates are correct.

Our router has the right ports forwarded, the server runs server software for things like http, svn, games, etc. Ive got a domain name registered that always points to our external IP address. For all intents and purposes, Ive got a typical webserver set up. My friends can game on my server by connecting via the domain name, I can push and pull svn projects, etc.p  pThe only problem is that I also need to use my server when Im connected to my home network the same network as the server. Using the domain name results in Windows resolving it to our own IP address, and my router is too retarded to realize it just needs to forward it back into our network to the server as per the usual. Ive done some looking around, configuring, telnetting and DNS overriding, but I have it on good authority that our ISP apparently crippled the DNS override feature of their routers to prevent this exact scenario. Apparently they dont like internal loopbacks.p  pI now basically have to keep 2 configs for each of my servers services one config that specifies the domain name for when Im abroad, and a second that specifies the servers internal IP for when Im at home. Its frustrating because it just isnt always possible.p  hr  pI want to instantiate a global DNS resolution requestresponse listener that will do the following if the requested domain name matches a given string, override the IP in the response with one of my choice.p  pIve looked things up like easyhook, dllimport, msdn pages, etc, but I still cant figure out where to actually start, which classes I need to get access to, and so on.

Negative 88155 pIve written a python program which processes a list of CIDR specd IP address blocks into a database.  This involves checking for duplicates or address overlaps, both within the list with the existing database table.  If duplicates or overlaps are found, an error report is written to a pythoncreated temporary file and vim is called to show the list of addresses and the error file side by side in a vim split window.  I want the split to be off center so that the pane with the list of addresses is narrower than the pane with the longer error statements.p  pIf the name of the error file were fixed I could set things the way I wanted to, outside of the program, save a vim session, and then load it from the command line within the program.  What I want to do is to strongstart vim with the proper asymmetric vertical splitstrong and load the address block list into the narrower window and the error file, with a dynamically created name, in the 2nd, wider window.  I can create a split using something like code30vscode. or resize and existing split with vertical res 30 in a .vimrc file but the asymmetry is overridden if I use the O option to load two files.  Is there any way to do this in vim using a dynamically generated temporary file as one of the editing targetsp

Negative 88155 pEdit I have identified the problem to be similar to the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4800490cannotgetridoftexturewrappingseaminopenglrq1herea but I still cant come up with a solution since my problem is a little different.p  pI am using C and HLSL and need to have my texture coordinates wrap so that the texture is tiled across a triangle.br After the coordinates are wrapped into 01 range they will be rotated, so I cant simply use the texture sampler AddressU and AddressV properties set to wrap, because they need to be wrapped and THEN rotated, so it cant be done inside the sampler.br The solution here is simple, just use the fractional part of the texture coordinate and it will wrap.brp  pHere is an example of a pixel shader that will tile the texture 36 times 6  6 p  precodeinput.tex  6.0f number of times to tile  2 input.tex  fracinput.tex wraps texCoords to 01 range return shaderTexture.SampleSampleType, input.tex codepre  pThis does tile the texture, but can create a problem at the boarder where the texture wraps. The tiles have to divide evenly into the space they are being displayed on or it creates a seam where the boarders meet. My square that the texture is drawn to is 800x600 pixels, so tiling by 5 will divide evenly but 6 will not and will cause seams along the Y axis.br I have tried using the modulus operator codeinput.tex  input.tex  1code to wrap the coordinates but I get the exact same results. I have also tried changing the texture filtering method and the AddressU and AddressV properties along with countless different methods of debugging. brbr I had some luck using this code. If the x coordinate is too high it gets set to 0, and if it is too low it gets set to 1.p  precodeinput.tex  6.0f input.tex  fracinput.tex if input.tex.x gt 0.999f input.tex.x  0 if input.tex.x lt 0.001f input.tex.x  1 return shaderTexture.SampleSampleType, input.tex codepre  pThis only fixes the problem in certain spots though, so it is definitely not a solution. brbrp  pHere is a picture that shows a texture left and what it looks like when wrapped manually right. You can see that not everywhere that the boarders touch has this error. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGKECa.jpg altenter image description herebrbr I have also tried not changing the texture coordinates to 01 range and rotating them around the center of each tile instead of 0.5, 0.5 but I get identical results. Also my texture coordinates are completely independent of the vertices and are calculated inside the pixel shader.brbrp  pAnything I have seen relating to this issue has to do with having a high value at one pixel and then a low value at the next, for example u  0.95 and the next pixel u  0.03, which causes it to interpolate backwards across the texture. But when I rotate my texture coordinates nothing changes at all. Even when each tile has a random rotation applied to it. In this case the edges have all sorts of different values bordering each other, not just a high value on the left side and a low value on the right side, but the area where the seam occurs never changes.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPhciA.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 88155 pIm using parse.com as my backend. I have 2 tables post and comment. A post have multiple comments, so it is a one to many relationship. so I have comment point to the post which is easy but also an array on post that list all the comments this post have. I imagine if I used MongoDB or any other NoSQL it will be the same.p  pOn front end, I have 2 modules post and comment. Each have a resource that is hooked with the backend. Each module also have all the CRUD pages that create, read, update and delete. When I write the view part, a post need to display all the comments below, so my post module depends on comment module and will use comment resource to find all comments for this post.p  pBut when I write the create part for comment, I found myself need to update the post array and add the newly created comment to the array. Which means I need the post resource to update the post. The post resource is in the post module so now my comment module depends on post module and created a circular dependency.p  pI have 2 solutions Im going to share, but I want to know if anyone have anything betterp  ol lipI use angularuirouter in my project. After a comment is created, I route back to a post state called app.post.commentCreated . This state is handled inside the post module. It will update the post array of comments.pli lipI separate the post resource and comment resource to their own module called postResource and commentResource and make post and comment module depends on both. I have not done this yet. Im about to.pli ol  pDo you have anything betterp  pThank you very muchp

Users can scroll to see the rest of the content, and no overlapping occurs.p  pHowever, on iPhones, it seems that the content shifts when zooming in, as if not registering that there is a padding from the left of the screen to keep the text where it should be.

Negative 88155 pIs there a way to universally multiply physics2D calculations on the canvasp  pIm trying to make a set of canvas UI elements with 2D physic properties. The objects contain images and text, but need to respond to gravity, impacts, and overlapping collision boxes with other GUI elements. p  pIve added 2D RigidBody and boxCollider components to my objects. However, they move very slowly. If given a gravity, they fall slowly. If overlapped, they push each other apart slowly.p  pIve figured out that this is due to the canvas having a very large scale. My objects are effectively very big and very far away. p  ul liI cant modify the canvas scale. It needs to be huge or I get render artifacts. li liI cant just modify gravity because it doesnt provide a universal fix. Things fall faster, but they dont push apart or spring right.li liI cant modify the timestep because it affects the whole world, not just the canvas. li ul  pMy canvas objects have widths akin to 80, where unity physics expects widths akin to 1. How can I get them to behave like they have a width of 1p  pIs there some universal scaling factor for canvas based physics, or am I simply misusing the canvas for something it is not intended forp

Negative 88155 pIn my company, we started our first project with ReactJs. Because in the end this might grow into a large system, we decided to use Flux to keep things organized. Although there are quite some examples, they mostly are not based on usage in a complex system.p  pOne of the things that we would like to realize is a UI that makes use of widgetlike components. For example, we have a component that displays information of a customer. This widget will be used on a tabpage with info of an invoice, but also on another tabpage with a customer card in the same browser window. And there will be some other components in which this widget will be used.p  pSo I have a React component that should listen to a change event of a store. However this component itself does not know what store to listen to, because I can have an invoice store, but also another store that has customer info that should be displayed.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26793023fluxreactcomplexreusablecomponentthisa question that gives some info on how to create a reusable component, but it does not give some tips on how to use a component with multiple stores.p  pOne thing that I consider is to pass the store to be used as a parameter into the reusable component. Would this be a wise thing to dop  pThanks in advance for your reactionsp

Negative 88155 pI have a thread reading from a specific plcs memory and it works perfectly. Now what I want is to start another thread to test the behavior of the system simulate the first thread in case of a conectivity issue, and when everything is Ok, continue the first thread. But I think Ill have problems with that because these two threads will need to use the same port. p  pMy first idea was to abort the first thread, start the second one and when the everythings OK again, abort this thread and restart the first one.p  pIve read some other forums and people say that aborting or suspending a thread is the worst solution, and Ive read about syncronization of threads but I dont really know if this is useful in this case because Ive never used it.p  pMy question is, what is the correct way to solve this kind of situationsp

Negative 88155 pWe have 2 fairly large automation projects going, both using BDD. One is in Lettuce for a desktop app, the other is for a website using JBehave we are just getting started with the web project.p  pWe have tried using Thucydides for reporting for our JBehave project, and started implementing tests using that.

Luckily, we found Allure early enough. p  p2 questionsp  p1 We spent 2 days trying to make Allure work with JBehave, but the only example on GitHub isnt working well all scenarios are reported together without breakdown by individual stories or scenarios.  Also, JBehave doesnt have an AfterStep decorator and its a requirement for us to save screenshots after each step, successful or not. Thucydides for all its faults took care of that. Does Allure have something similar If not, then at least is there a working example of how to make it report stories and scenarios correctly when run from JBehavep  p2 I havent tried yet, but doesnt look like there is an adapter for Lettuce Python.  Can someone recommend a way to produce Allure reports from Lettucep  pThanks a lotp

I have done a bunch of reading and was pointed towards using HAL....I then found that his function had been deprecated and replaced by udev. I did a bunch more reading and found out how to use UDEV and created the folowing rule which i have proved works by linking directly to a ripping scriptp  precode    ACTIONchange, SUBSYSTEMSscsi, KERNELs[rg][09], ATTRSvendorTSSTcorp, MODE0660, GROUPoptical, RUNhomejlivin25myscriptsDiscTypeTest.sh codepre  pI realised that I needed an intermediate script that would do the work to determine what the optical media type is.

Negative 88155 pI am developing an app which will have numerous user and product information. When I used to develop for desktop or web platforms, I would load all the pertinent data from the database into the model during application initialization. In other words, when the application would load, it will populate the entire Model hierarchy with data from the database. This required more memory but that wasnt an issue on the desktop and web platforms as much. My question is in the iOS platform, should I load only those data that will be presented in the view at any one time to manage memory Or should I load all the data during app opening and hold the data in memory. Also, I am assuming the data will be loaded at the Model level. Is there any best practice regarding how database data can be loaded into a Model in iOS Should I make a database call inside init or is there a better wayp

Negative 88155 pIm new to FluxReact and Im having a hard time understanding some of the fundamental architecture decisionsp  ol liI know all stores are meant to be singletons, but are they all created at app start, or can the lifetime of a store be smaller, specific to the users actionsli liCan I have multiple instances of the same store type, each initialized with a different contextli ol  pUnfortunately, all the examples Ive seen seem too simplistic to answer these questions. Lets start with a hrefhttpsfacebook.github.iofluxdocschat.html relnofollowFacebooks chat app examplea. There are multiple threads each with messages. MessageStore holds all the messages for the entire app and a method called getAllForThreadid returns a filtered subset of messages. When a message comes into ANY thread, it emits a change notification that causes the MessageSection react component to refetch data regardless of which thread the user is viewing. This obviously doesnt scale. What if we had 10,000 threads each with lots of message activity Heres how I decided to solve the issuep  ol liEach MessageStore is initialized with a thread id.li liCreate a singleton MessageStoreFactory that creates and manages MessageStores.li liWhen the user clicks on a thread, instead of the React component subscribing to a global MessageStore, it asks the MessageStoreFactory for the MessageStore for emthat specificem thread.li liIf the factory already has a MessageStore for that thread, it returns it. Otherwise it creates one, kicks off an async task to fetch the initial data for it, and returns it.li liWhen the React component is torn down lets say the user navigates away from it, it notifies the Factory that its all done with the Store. Using reference counting or some other cache logic would allow the Factory to prune unused stores.li ol  pHow far off base am I with this approach Is there a simpler approach that still scalesp

doesnt work for the POSTp  pEDITbr When SecretAuthenticationFilter tries to compare the HMAC sent, with what it thinks the HMAC should be they dont match. The reason is the MD5Hash of the content doesnt match the MD5Hash of the received content. The RestClient hashes the content using a JavaScriptSerializer.Serialized version of the content, but then the PostRequest passes the object as JsonMediaTypeFormatted. p  pThese two types dont get formatted the same. For instance, the JavaScriptSerializer gives us dates like this EnteredDateDate1434642998639p  pThe passed content has dates like this EnteredDate20150618T115638.63904070400p  pI guess I need the hash to use the same data thats passed, so the Filter on the other end can confirm it correctly. Thoughtsp  pEDIT Found the answer, I needed to change the SetupClient code from using this linep  precodevar json  new JavaScriptSerializer.Serializecontent contentMD5  Hashing.GetHashMD5OfStringjson codepre  pTo using thisp  precodevar json  JsonConvert.SerializeObjectcontent contentMD5  Hashing.GetHashMD5OfStringjson codepre  pNow the sent content formatted via JSON will match the hashed content.p  pI was not the person who wrote this code originally. p

Negative 88155 pI have injected a DLL into an external application that is based on the QT framework. I then use the command QApplicationallWidgets and iterate through the list of widgets to find a QGraphicsView that represents the window I want to interact with. The buttons and other controls in the scene are all derived from QGraphicsObject. I dont have the source, so I can only cast to QGraphicsObject and not the actual type. The list of methods from the metaobject is incomplete, which is to be expected, because I cast to a QGraphicsObject. I can find the method names using IDA though. Is it possible to call a particular method, and how would you do itp

Negative 88155 pstrongThe Problemstrong For beginners, what is the fastest  simplest way to get two programs running in different languages and running on different computers to send simple messages to each otherp  pstrongMy Detailsstrong I have two computers, one running a program in Visual C, and one running a program in Visual Basic both off of visual studio 2013, although I may need to do this with some older visual basic code, pre .NET era. They are running in different languages for a combination of hardware and legacy reasons. The communication would be simple a simple binary trigger onoff signal would work, or if it was easy a single character, word, or string describing the programs status.p  pstrongWhat Ive Triedstrong I know little about communication protocols and this sort of thing, but I understand that Socket programming might be a simple way to do such communication. It sounds like the TCP Protocol would suit me fine. Unfortunately all examples that I have seen communicate using the same programming language e.g. C to C or basic to basic. I also understand that an alternative might be to run some basic code from within C or viceversa, but this seems like a somewhat cumbersome solution.p  pUsing some online guides, Ive been able to get my two computers to communicate with each other when they are both using C via the Winsock tool, but when I try to mash a C Server with a Visual Basic Client, they fail to connect. The code I am using, which has largely been hijacked and slightly modified from the following websites a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.sockets.tcpclientvvs.110.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.sockets.tcpclientvvs.110.aspxa and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms738545vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms738545vvs.85.aspxa is below, in case youd like to look at it.p  pstrongSummary Questionsstrongp  ul liIs a direct socket communication between Visual C and Visual Basic Possibleli liAre there better alternativesli liAm I an idiotli liIs there somewhere a beginner should go to learn about these types of thingsli liLet me know if there is anything I can do to clarify the question.li ul  pstrongThe Visual Basic TCP Clientstrongp  precodeImports System Imports System.Text Imports System.IO Imports System.Net Imports System.Net.Sockets Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic  Public Class GetSocket  Shared Sub Connectserver As [String], message As [String]     Try          Create a TcpClient.

Negative 88155 pSo we have tons of sale data and product data. We want to run a variety of reports and I am struggling on the best approach to do so. A lot of the data is redundant and since there is a ton of data I want to make sure I save as much resources as possible to make the reports fast and avoid the dreaded Fatal error, memory exhausted message.p  pThere are 8 different datasets. Each one is unique in itself but data could be shared be shared between them all. Some of the data is displayed in graphs others are displayed in tables.p  pWhat I was planning on doing was crating a few classes that would gather all the data and start to organize it. I was trying to build a central hub of data in an arrayobject that I can then pick bits and pieces of it to display the datasets I would need. Doing so the problem I run into is it becomes very linear. To give you an example, here is a bit of code from what I have startedp  precodeclass Reports     public soldData  array    public sizes  array    public products  array     public function construct         thisgtgetSoldData        thisgtgetSizes        thisgtgetProductData         public function getSoldData         data  thisgtdbgtfetchAssocSELECT productid, price FROM orders WHERE sold  1 AND UNIXTIMESTAMPcreated BETWEEN 1388534400 AND 1440555051        foreachdata as d             thisgtsoldData[d[productid]]  arrayprice gt d[price]                 public function getSizes         productIDs  implode,, arraykeysthisgtsoldData        data  thisgtdbgtfetchAssocSELECT id, name, abbr FROM sizes WHERE id IN productIDs        foreachdata as d              thisgtsizes[d[id]]  arrayname gt d[name], abbr gt d[abbr]                 public function getProductData         productIDs  implode,, arraykeysthisgtsoldData        thisgtproducts  thisgtdbgtfetchAssocSELECT  FROM products WHERE id IN productIDs      codepre  pBasically I have to grab one set of data before I can move on. You cant go out of order on this or the whole thing collapses in on itself. Also my end size of the class Reports is huge because it contains thousands of keys and nested arrays.p  pI feel like my thought process and approach to this is over complicated. I do these big allinone queries so I can limit the MySQL footprint to save resources. I will grab a bunch of IDs and run one query to pull a bunch of the same unique data back.p  pI am curious to see what problems this approach poses and if the StackOverflow community could shed some helpful pointers or tips to achieve my goal.p

Negative 88155 pSo right now Im trying to make a game where you keep running right and have to jump over obstacles. Ive made it so that the ground is made out of two big blocks, and when you are a fourth of the way on the second block the first block get moved in front of the second block. This is my code for this.p  precode    public void updateGround     ifplayer.getPosition.x gt blocks[1].getGeneratePoint         swap the blocks in the array         Block tempblock  blocks[0]          blocks[0]  blocks[1]         blocks[1]  tempblock          Body body1  blocks[0].getBody         blocks[1].getBody.setTransformbody1.getPosition.xgBlockSize2B2DVars.PPM,                 0,0       codepre  pI wanted to stress test this so I made the block size kinda small and just left it running but I notice after awhile my guy stops running. I realised by using the b2drenderer and other testing that somehow the player is making contact with the second block and it stops right where the second block begins.p  pIs this some sort of bug or did I do something wrong I know for sure that neither ground block change their y value or their angles cause their set to be 0 and I have even tried making it so that the ground block go into eachother, but the player still stop where the second block begins.p
Negative 88155 pSo I have this really, really strange problem with getting data using socket from server which is working on my PC to Android app. All in local network for now. It is strange, because I wrote server and client apps both using sockets to send and get data and it works really great. I tried to do exactly the same on Android and it gets only first response from server, but not the rest after sending token. I searched through SO and saw piece of advice that available method is not right so I changed it and its still not working as I wish it would. I think there is something wrong with serverside app or android app works way too fast for server and it sends data after ending transmission on android, but I tried to give it a bit of time and nothing...p  pThis is server app in general it gets token, lets say RAM then it gets output from linux process and sends it straight to android appp  precodeimport java.net. import java.util.ArrayList

Im using part of code from tutorialspoint.com. If you need classes for getting data for ram, cpu, storage, temperatures or uptime processes let me know. For now Ive spent around 4 days trying to figure out what is wrong with my code for android because servers sends data correctly, Im 99 sure. Please help me. Im powerless and I want this app wake to work so so badly right now Actually I made this work using tomcat server, but I want my own server in here.p  pThanks.p

Negative 88155 pAs part of an assignment, I have to write a method that will print out repeating values in a linked list, as well as how many times they occur. Below is the method codeprintRepeatscode which uses the helper method codecountRepeatsListNode nodecode.p  pThe issue is that the output of my method prints repeating values over and over again.

Negative 88155 pIve developed an Internet application in C and I want to sell it however I dont want it to be illegally copied everywhere. It requires the Internet to function, so it seems like an active Internet licensing scheme would be appropriate. Im looking for a licensing program that requires active validation from the parent server for its ongoing use, and I should have the ability to shut the program down or licensing key if there are too many copies running off of its licensing keyor whatever simultaneously. Does anyone know of any licenses like this p  pIm sure they exist, but I dont really know what theyre called to effectively search for them.p
