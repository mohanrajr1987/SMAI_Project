Positive 72390 pI have a situation where passing ownership of a raw pointer may throw an exception. There are several such blocks, and it would be inelegant to wrap each in a trycatch just to delete pointers which werent accepted. Instead Im using a codeuniqueptrltAgtcode to manage my pointer with RAIIp  precodeuniqueptrltAgt anew A obj.takea.get  pass ownership to obj, might throw a.release  release pointer since obj is now responsible codepre  pSo the idea behind this is to keep ownership of the raw pointer in the current function until it has been successfully passed to codesomebody.takecode. This seems like a very nice pattern to me, but is it really Any pitfalls Im overlookingp
Positive 72390 pMy development environment has RHEL 5.8 which does not support GCC 4.8 modern C11 compilers.  I anticipate that someday well get there, so I have a header file where I define macros based on C11 support levels so I can do something like thisp  precodeif definedCPP11autotypeinference ampamp definedCPP11rangebasedforloops   for auto vit  args else   stdvectorltstdstringgtconstiterator vit, vend   for vendargs.end,vitargs.begin vit  vend vit endif     process arguments...     stdcout ltlt Processing  ltlt vit ltlt  ltlt stdendl     . . .     end process arguments loop codepre  pSo, what Im trying to do in C98 is the equivalent of the iterator strongreferencestrong or is it more accurate to say a dereferenced iterator, like belowp  precodefor autoamp it  args   stdcout ltlt Processing  ltlt it ltlt  ltlt stdendl codepre  pFor the life of me, I cannot figure out how to get a dereferenced iterator or iterator reference in C98.

In any case, is it more costly to use codefor autoamp it  veccode than codefor auto it  veccodep  pThank you in advance for your insight.p

Positive 72390 blockquote   pDesign and code a class named codeTextcode that manages a dynamically allocated array of strings. Upon instantiation, a codeTextcode object receives nothing or a reference to an unmodifiable string. The string holds the name of the text file that contains the records to be stored in an object of this class. If the file does not exist, the codeTextcode object assumes a safe empty state. If the file exists, the oneargument constructor allocates memory for the number of records contained in the file and copies them into memory. To review the syntax for reading from a text file using an codeifstreamcode object see the chapter in your OOP244 notes entitled emCustom File Operatorsem.

Positive 72390 pOkay, Im trying to implement a range tree in ndimensions using variadic templates.  I have the basic setup working, but I want to be able to optionally pass a compare function object in the template list to sort the tree by something other than stdless.  p  pMy first thought is that I could overload the template list with a version that includes a pair as the first element, with the pair containing the type and the compare funcition.  But I cant see to get the template declaration line to compile.  Visual C 2015 starts with C2079 stdpairfirst uses undefined class T.p  pAnyways, on to the code.  Heres a  small snippet to show what Im trying to dop  precodetemplate ltclass... Argsgt class rangetree   template ltclass T, class... Argsgt class rangetreeltT, Args...gt  public   map ltT, rangetreeltArgs...gt  gt tree  codepre  pThis all works normally.  But when I add another version of rangetree, with a pair as the first template member, I have problemsp  precodetemplate ltpairltclass T, class Comparegt, class... Argsgt class rangetreeltpairltT, Comparegt, Args...gt public   map ltT, rangetree ltArgs...gt , Comparegt tree  codepre  pThis is the part I can seem to get formatted in a way that the compiler is happy.  The idea is to optionally pair template members with compare functions if something other than less should be used.p

They have to constructed directly into the memory allocated by the container.p  pFor that, I decided to use placement new and delegate the memory management completely to the container implementation found some useful information about placement new at a hrefhttpwww.drdobbs.comcppcallingconstructorswithplacementnew232901023 relnofollowdrdobbsa.p  pA running example is found a hrefhttpcoliru.stackedcrooked.comadefd059e8250c685 relnofollowherea. Please note, that the use of codenew uint8t[size]code and codestdqueuecode is just to keep the example simple.

My concern is while the emunderlyingem integral type used to represent the numeric range of the individual enumerators is perfectly capable of representing code0code as a value, that 0 value does not map to the constants themselves. Its this differentiation that is confusing the integral type range vs the range of the enumerations enumerators. codetcodes value seems to be well defined from the perspective of an codeintcode, but it is not well defined in the sense that as a scalar, it does not map to one of the enums constants.p  pMy searching resulted in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27935026thebehaviorofvalueinitializinganenumthis SO posta, however the top answer was emveryem technical and I didnt quite understand.

Positive 72390 pHere is the problem I was thinking about lately.

It is very ugly, requires extra effort, introduces redundant moves, gets in the way of copy elision and probably has many other problems.p  pMy second thought was a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiContinuationpassingstyle relnofollowcontinuationpassing stylea, which works quite well but turns member functions into member function templates.

Negative 72390 pIve seen lots of articles and questions about mysqli, and all of them claim that it protects against sql injections. But is it fool proof, or is there still some way to get around it. Im not interested in cross site scripting or phishing attacks, only sql injections.p  pWhat I should have said to begin with is that I am using prepared statements. That is what I meant with mysqli. If I use prepared statements without any string concatenation, then is it foolproofp
Negative 72390 pIm starting to write my first Delphi application that connects to an SQL database MySQL using the ADO database components.  I wondered whether  there was any best way of storing the names of the fields in the database for easy reference when creating SQL queries later on.p  pFirst of all I made them a simple constant e.g. codecUserTableUsername, cUserTablePasswordcode, but then decided that was not a particularly good way of doing things so I am now storing them in a constant record e.g.p  precodetype    TUserTable  record      TableName  String      Username  String      Password  String  end  const UserTable  TUserTable             TableName  users       Username  Username       Password  Password      codepre  pthis allows me to create a statement likep  precodequery.SQL.AddSELECT   UserTable.Username   FROM   UserTable.TableName codepre  pand not have to worry about hard coding the field names etc.p  pIve now run into the problem however where if I want to cycle through the table fields for example if there are 20 or so fields, I cant.  I have to manually type the record reference for every field.p  pI guess what Id like to know is whether there is a way to iterate though all field names at once, or singularly or am I going about this the wrong way  Perhaps I shouldnt be storing them like this at allp  pAlso, Ive made a Database class which basically holds methods for many different SQL statements, for example GetAllUsers, GetAllProducts, etc.  Does that sound correct  Ive taken a look at a lot of DelphiSQL tutorials, but they dont seem to go much past showing you how to run queries.p  pI suppose Im just a little lost and any help is very welcome.

Negative 72390 pIn my application, I have the following recurring pattern where I get the feeling that this is an incomplete or warped version of some common pattern that Im not aware of. In my implementation, I cant seem to find a good way to implement a particular operation, as described below.p  pA collection of objects, lets call them sources, produces data if you call a method on them. An instance of a hrefhttpjava.sun.comj2se1.5.0docsapijavautilconcurrentScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html relnofollowScheduledThreadPoolExecutora from codea hrefhttpjava.sun.comj2se1.5.0docsapijavautilconcurrentpackagesummary.html relnofollowjava.util.concurrentacode is used to periodically do readings on the sources and put the data on a common outbound queuep  pre o       method calls     o       lt           o                                o o  o      data           sources             thread pool          outbound queue pre  pThe sources, the thread pool and the queue are members of a class that provides methods to add sources and to retrieve the head of the queue.p  pBelow is the code to add a new source. Im wondering what happens if I remove a source from the collection.p  precodepublic void vAddSourceISource src      this.rgSources.addsrc     final ISource srcT  src      q is the outbound queue, which is a private member in the class      defining this method.

If I remove the identifier from the collection, the object is still there, hence the thread pool will continue to read from it as if nothing happened.p  pAm I understanding this correctly And what would be a typical approach if you wanted the thread pool to take note of the removal and also discard the sourcep

Negative 72390 pIm trying to use code contracts with .NET 3.5 in a large desktop application project, which also have a mixed mode C DLL dependency, written in old managed C syntax.p  pThe real solution consists of at least 20 projects, but lets assume that there is only A, B, C, and D projects, and the mixed mode M project. C depends on A, B and M. A, B and C are all configured to perform runtime checking, and the code rewrite works well. Now I wanted to add some contracts to one of the higher level assemblies to, called D. D depends on all the others, A, B, C and M too. Now the code rewrite fails for D with the following message Ive changed the namesp  precode15gt    Reading assembly C from builddebugC.dll resulted in errors. 15gt    ccrewrite  error  Rewrite aborted due to metadata errors.

But the C assembly in its own can be coderewritten succesfully, while it also references M.p  pI also think that the problem doesnt lie directly in the D assembly, because Ive tried it with other higher level assemblies in the same solution and they cant be rewritten by the code contracts tool if they reference C.p  pThe version Im using is 1.2.21023.14p  pIve also asked this question in the CodeContracts MSDN forum but havent received any answers yet, so I thought Id try here. Im interested in any workaround or idea related to this.p

Negative 72390 pIs it possible to deserialize object properties, using any of the standard serializers, without creating a new objectp  pProblem is, the objects in question are very complex they can only be created by a special factory, and their types are dynamically generated at runtime, but they have some known properties, which I would like to store in external file preferably xml, but binary is OK too, and later possibly after application is restarted, I want stored properties to be set back to the object I provide.p  pIt seems all the standard serializers can only generate a new object for me which also requires a public parameterless constructor, from which I would have to manually assign all the properties. This is not much different from manual serialization, which I would like to avoid, since a set of serialized properties is quite large and is probably going to change a few times during project lifetime. At this point Im quite close to writing my own lightweight serializer, but maybe someone could suggest a more standard way of doing such thingsp

Negative 72390 pI work for a fulfillment company and we have to pack and ship many orders from our warehouse to customers. To improve efficiency we would like to group identical orders and pack these in the most optimum way. By identical I mean having the same number of order lines containing the same SKUs and same order quantities.p  pTo achieve this I was thinking about hashing each order. We can then group by hash to quickly see which orders are the same.p  pWe are moving from an Access database to a PostgreSQL database and we have .NET based systems for data loading and general order processing systems, so we can either do the hashing during the data loading or hand this task over to the DB.p  pMy question firstly is should the hashing be managed by DB, possibly using triggers, or should the hash be created onthefly using a view or somethingp  pAnd secondly would it be best to calculate a hash for each order line and then to combine these to find an orderlevel hash for grouping, or should I just use a trigger for all CRUD operations on the order lines table which recalculates a single hash for the entire order and store the value in the orders tablep  pTIAp

Also, there would be no limit to the number of templates and instances created.p  pPurely from a serverpersistence perspective, what is the best way of creating a system like this Would I need to create a new database table for each created template and then insert the form instances as records into the table How well would this scalep

Negative 72390 pIm using VS 2010 to build the deployment package for a web application. I manually deploy it to the IIS 6.0 server using the deployment ccommand script it generates. All the stuff gets copied under the Inetpub default website properly. The only issue I have is that the folder permissions keep getting reset once I deploy.p  pSay my website is under the folder Mywebsite. I grant certain user XYS full control to this folder. All is well. The next time I deploy, user XYZ no longer has full control and the permissions gets reset.p

Negative 72390 pIve got a page containing a lot of images, which are initially hidden from view as Im using tabbed divs ie. hiding some divs using CSS displaynone.p  pTherefore, when then page loads, it takes ages to load all of the images, which looks like the page is slow as the loading bar on the browser doesnt complete for 10 seconds.p  pI would like a way of not loading images until they are visible on the page.p  pIve played around with a hrefhttpwww.appelsiini.netprojectslazyload relnofollowjQuery LazyLoada, however this only seems to load images when scrolling the browser which doesnt work for tabbed divs.p  pTherefore, is there a way of changing LazyLoad to work like this, or is there a better way of doing thisp  pThanksp
Negative 72390 pThis is a best practice question, and I expect the answer to be it depends. I just hope to learn more real world scenarios and workflows.p  pFirst of all, Im talking about different changes for the same project, so no subrepo please.p  pLets say you have your code base in an hg repository. You start to work on a complicated new feature A, then a complicated bug B is reported by your trusted tester you have testers, right.p  pIts trivial if the fix for B depends on A. You simlply ci A then ci B.p  pMy question is what to do when they are independent or at least it seems now.p  pI can think of the following waysp  ol liUse a separate clone for B.li liUse anonymous or named branches, or bookmarks, in the same repository.li liUse MQ with B patch on top of A.li liUse branched MQ Ill explain later.li liUse multiple MQ since 1.6li ol  p1 and 2 are covered by an a hrefhttpstevelosh.comblog200908aguidetobranchinginmercurialexcellent bloga by Steve Losh linked from a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1405604managingreleasebranchesinmercurialslightly related questiona.p  pThe one huge advantage of 1 over the other choices is that it doesnt require any rebuild when you switch from working on one thing to the other, because the files are physically separated and independent. So its really the only choice if, for example, A andor B touches a header file that defines a tristate boolean and is included by thousands of C files dont tell me you havent seen such a legacy code base.p  p3 is probably the easiest in terms of setup and overhead, and you can flip the order of A and B if B is a small andor urgent fix. However it can get tricky if A and B touches the same files. Its easy to fix patch hunks that  failed to apply if A and B changes are orthogonal within the same files, but conceptually its still a bit risky.p  p4 can make you dizzy but its the most powerful and flexible and scalable way. I default codehg qinitcode with codeccode since I want to mark workinprogress patches and pushpull them, but it does take a conceptual leap to realize that you can branch in MQ repo too. Here are the steps mq  hg mqp  ol licodehg qnew bugAcode make changes for A codehg qrefcodeli licodemq branch branchA hg qcicodeli licodehg qpop mq up rtipcodeli licodehg qnew bugBcode make changes for B codehg qrefcodeli licodemq branch branchB hg qcicodeli liTo work on A again codehg qpop mq up branchA hg qpushcodeli ol  pIt seems crazy to take so many steps, and whenever you need to switch work you must codehg qci hg qpop mq up ltbranchgt hg qpushcode. But consider this you have several named release branches in the same repository, and you need to work on several projects and bug fixes at the same time for all of them youd better get guaranteed bonus for this kind of work. Youd get lost very soon with the other approaches.p  pNow my fellow hg lovers, are there otherbetter alternativesp  hr  pUPDATE codeqqueuecode almost makes 4 obsolete.

Negative 72390 pIm sorry if the title isnt clear, but this is a weird problem.p  pI codegit checkoutcode to my stage branch and codegit pullcode to get my partners latest changes which he pushed last night to the stage branch on the remote repository, and sure enough, they merge to my local stage branch. codegit log ltbranchgtcode shows five commits he performed last night.p  pI then switch over to the master branch to pull that from the repo because he told me he merged those changes to the master branch after testing them. But when I codegit checkout stagecode to get back to my stage branch it says Im ahead of the remote branch by 5 commits. I codegit log originstagecode and it shows none of the five commits I just pulled from that repository the only remote repository on this project. codegit log stagecode shows the five commits on my local stage branch, so Im at a loss at how the remote branch could have gone back in time immediately after serving me my partners latest commits.p  pIm pretty new at this, so Ill appreciate your patience with me, as Im still trying to grasp DCVSs and theres a good chance Im simply misunderstanding something really basic.p
Negative 72390 pWhen you have a derived object with a move constructor, and the base object also has move semantics, what is the proper way to call the base object move constructor from the derived object move constructorp  pI tried the most obvious thing firstp  precode DerivedDerivedampamp rval  Baserval    codepre  pHowever, this seems to end up calling the Base objects emcopy constructorem.  Then I tried explicitly using codestdmovecode here, like thisp  precode DerivedDerivedampamp rval  Basestdmoverval    codepre  pThis worked, but Im confused why its necessary.  I thought codestdmovecode merely returns an rvalue reference.  But since in this example codervalcode is already an rvalue reference, the call to codestdmovecode should be superfluous.  But if I dont use codestdmovecode here, it just calls the copy constructor.  So why is the call to codestdmovecode necessaryp

When they click on a contact, the fields should be filled in as they already are, not be blank with a Hint. Problem now is that the fields arent populated, everything else works just fine but all the fields just have hints instead of the text the user filled in for the contact upon creation. Here is the codep  pContacList.classs code...p  precodeOverride     protected void onListItemClickListView l, View v, int position, long id          super.onListItemClickl, v, position, id         mDbAdapter  new TagDBAdapterthis         mDbAdapter.open         Cursor cursor  mCursor         cursor.moveToPositionposition         Intent intent  new Intentthis, AddEditContact.class         intent.putExtraTagDBAdapter.KEYROWID, id         startActivityForResultintent, ACTIVITYEDIT      codepre  pCode for the AddEditContact.classp  precodeOverride     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         this.initLayout         mDbAdapter  new TagDBAdapterthis         mDbAdapter.open         Bundle extras  getIntent.getExtras         mRowId  extras.getLongTagDBAdapter.KEYROWID         ifmRowId  null              mContact  mDbAdapter.fetchContactmRowId             mfirstNameEditE.setTextmContact.getFirstName             mlastNameEditE.setTextmContact.getLastName             mphoneNumberEdit.setTextmContact.getPhoneNumber             memailEditE.setTextmContact.getEmail             mhomePhoneEditE.setTextmContact.getHomePhone             mworkPhoneEditE.setTextmContact.getWorkPhone               codepre  pFetch contact codep  pHere is the code for fetchContactp  precodepublic Contact fetchContactlong rowId throws SQLException          Contact contact  new Contact         Cursor mCursor               mDb.querytrue, DATABASETABLE, new String[] KEYROWID, KEYFIRSTNAME, KEYLASTNAME, KEYNAME, KEYNUMBER,                      KEYEMAIL, KEYHOMEPHONE, KEYWORKPHONE, KEYROWID    rowId, null, null, null, null, null         ifmCursor  null              mCursor.moveToFirst                  whilemCursor.moveToNext              contact.setFirstNamemCursor.getStringmCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrowKEYFIRSTNAME             contact.setLastNamemCursor.getStringmCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrowKEYLASTNAME             contact.setNamemCursor.getStringmCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrowKEYNAME             contact.setPhoneNumbermCursor.getStringmCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrowKEYNUMBER             contact.setEmailmCursor.getStringmCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrowKEYEMAIL             contact.setHomePhonemCursor.getStringmCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrowKEYHOMEPHONE             contact.setWorkPhonemCursor.getStringmCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrowKEYWORKPHONE                  return contact      codepre  pSo Im getting the extras from the intent and getting the KEYROWID, and if it isnt null, setting the text of the EditTexts to the getters for the contact object I got from the fetchContactlong rowId class, which returns a Contact object.

Negative 72390 pIts a weird problem with stylesheets I have a window, child of class QWidget. I apply a stylesheet to it to ideally change the background of the entire window to an image with a repeatx and repeaty, tiling it.p  pThe stylesheet pipeline works. If I use backgroundcolor and set it to say, red, the entire window will be painted red. however, if I use the backgroundimage, it does not. if i add a CHILD WIDGET using QtDesigner inside the window, the backgroundimage will work, just inside that child widget, but not outside of it, all over the parent window. p  pObviously I am doing something wrong, but am really clueless as to why  the backgroundcolor would work on the entire window, but the backgroundimage wont, unless theres a child widget, and then, only inside of it. p
Negative 72390 pIm developing some image processing software in C on Intel which has to run a bicubic interpolation algorithm on small about 1kpx images over and over again. This takes a lot of time, and Im aiming to speed it up. What I have now is a basic implementation based on the literature, a somewhatimproved with regard to speed version which doesnt do matrix multiplication, but rather uses precalculated formulas for parts of the interpolating polynomial and last, a fixedpoint version of the matrixmultiplying code works slower actually. I also have an external library with an optimized implementation, but its still too slow for my needs. What I was considering next isp  ul livectorization using MMXSSE stream processing, on both the floating and fixedpoint versionsli lidoing the interpolation in the Fourier domain using convolutionli lishifting the work onto a GPU using OpenCL or similarli ul  pWhich of these approaches could yield greatest performance gains Could you suggest another Thanks.p

However, unlike the instructions from the guide a hrefhttpteleal.orgprojectsclingsupportmanualclingsupportmanual.htmljavadoc.example.mediaserver.ContentDirectoryBrowseTestherea, I dont get back any actual media items, just storage directories in the browse result. This kind of makes sense as DLNA organizes things into a hierarchy like sop  precodeMusic     All Music     Artists         Fleetwood Mac         ...     Albums     ...

How do I get the top level of storage directories, then how can I browse each one of those directories My goal is to at least build a simple browser. p

Negative 72390 pI havent used OLECOM for quite some time as a developer, but I currently have a need to use some 3rd party OCX code libraries from a C program.p  pThe C program uses threading its a TCP socket server.  The OCXs are marked as Apartment threading model.  From my reading, I concluded that if I was careful to create one instance of each OCX per thread, and only to use that instance from the thread that created it, I should be OK.p  pI did also dop  precodemyThread.SetApartmentStateApartmentState.STA codepre  pbefore starting each thread.p  pShould this be enough to ensure safe use of the OCXsp  pThe symptom Im seeing is that threads can all create OCXs but on an apparently random basis, the calls to prepare and initialize the OCXs fail.  They dont seem to return any useful information as to why.p  pCan anyone explain what Im seeing, or give me a guide to using these OCXs safely from threaded codep  pAlternatively, should I just give up and create a single instance of each and all OCXs in one thread, and send all calls to them via a threadsafe queue or similarp

Negative 72390 pIm using UIImagePickerController in a popover on the iPad to take a picture with the front camera.  I set allowsEditing to YES and get the awesome built in Move and Scale view after taking the picture.  The crop rectangle in this view measures 320x267 on the screen despite the fact that the image is cropped to a 320x320 square a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu2246698moveAndScale.pnghttpdl.dropbox.comu2246698moveAndScale.pnga.  If i accept the image as is without resizing or moving it, there is a 25px high black bar across the top as if the crop rectangle has been positioned too high on the image a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu2246698cropped.pnghttpdl.dropbox.comu2246698cropped.pnga.  In fact, if i get that crop rectangle from the media info dictionary via UIImagePickerControllerCropRect it shows that the y origin of the crop rectangle is at 39.  This seems broken that the image would be incorrectly cropped by default and usually when it seems broken its because i did it wrong. Has anyone ever seen this or know of some setting to twiddle that will be good for my cropsp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 72390 pDont be put off by the long text, the points are quite trivial but require a bit of code to illustrate the problem. p  pstrongThe Setupstrong p  pSay I would like to create a trait, here modeled as a codeConvertercode of some kind, that itself is generic but has a typed method codeconvertcode that returns an appropriately typed result object, say a codeContainer[T]codep  precode trait Converter     def convert[T] input T   Container[T]     trait Container[T]   details dont matter codepre  pMy question is about type constraints on methods, in particular for enforcing equality, and has two closely related parts. p  pstrongPart 1strong Say now that there was a specialized container type that was particularly suitable for arraybased contents, like sop  precode object Container     trait ForArrays[U] extends Container[Array[U]]    codepre  pGiven this possibility, Id now like to specialize the Converter and in particular the return type of the codeconvertcode method, to the specialized codeContainer.ForArrayscode typep  precode object Converter     trait ForArrays extends Converter        the following line is rubbish  how to do this right      def convert[E,T lt Array[E]] input T   Container.ForArrays[E]        codepre  pSo that I can do something like thisp  precodeval converter  new Converter.ForArrays  ...  val input  Array A, B, C     val converted  Container.ForArrays[Char]  converter.convert input  codepre  pBasically I want Scala, if the type of converter is known to be codeConverter.ForArrayscode, to also infer the specialized return type of codeconvert[Char]code as codeContainer.ForArrays[Char]code, i.e. the matching container type plus the array type of the input. Is this or something like it possible and if so, how do I do it E.g. how do I specify the type parameters  bounds on convert what is provided is just a standin  I have no idea how to do this. Oh, and naturally so that it still overrides its super method, otherwise nothing is gained.p  pstrongPart 2strong As a fallback, should this not be possible, I could of course push the convert function down into the Arrayfocused variant, like so  p  precode trait Converter    now pretty useless as a shared trait  object Converter     trait ForValues extends Converter        def convert[T] input T   Container[T]         trait ForArrays extends Converter       def convert[E] input Array[E]   Container.ForArrays[E]        codepre  pOK. Now say I have an even more specialized codeConverter.ForArrays.SetBasedcode that can internally use a set of elements of type E the same as the input array element type to do some particular magic during the conversion. The set is now a parameter of the trait, however, like sop  precode case class SetBased set Set[F]  extends Converter.ForArrays      the following line is also rubbish...    def convert[E  F] input Array[E]   Container.ForArrays[E]  ...   codepre  pAgain, this is about the type parameters of the convert method. The difficulty here is how do I glue the type parameter of the class  codeFcode  to the type parameter of the method  codeEcode  such that the Scala compiler will only let the user call codeconvertcode with an array whose elements match the elements of the set Example p  precodeval set  Set X, Y, Z  val converter  new Converter.ForArrays.SetBased set  val input  Array A, B, C     val converted  Container.ForArrays[Char]  converter.convert input  codepre

The applet tag points a a class file, i.e., a compiled source file. Compiling a .java file creates a .class file, simple enough. But how does one get from an applet java file to an applet class file Attempting to compile via the command line or any IDE fails, because theres no main method. So far, the only way that Ive been able to get a class file for an applet is to compile the code either using Netbeans applet viewer or Run as an applet in Eclipse. Is there another way to obtain the class file Or do I have to compile using an applet emulator for lack of a better wordp

Negative 72390 pIm running jsf app on glassfish v3. Machine has poor internet connection, so my idea was to move static content css files, web graphics, fonts etc to external hosting using apache. I use jsf 2.0 resources, so links are generated like codejavax.faces.resourcescreen.css.htmllncsscode. Question is, how can I automagically redirect such resources to external machine The ideal way would be change it in one place maybe glassfish configuration rather than change every link in whole app. THanksp

Negative 72390 pI have a somewhat simple game that Im making and now that Im testing what I consider a bare bone version of the app on devices, I keep getting crashes over and over. Im fairly new at debugging on actual devices, so any help would be great.p  pThe really weird part is that it will usually crash when nothing is firing. No touches, no animations, nothing is happening. Ive tried running Instruments to check for memory leaks.

I wrote a wrapper around methods of foo.dll, call it FooWrapper, and with marshaling and a bit of hammering I finally make it work as you may know, when using codeDllImportcode all methods exposed need to be marked as codestaticcode and codeexterncode foo.dll exposes some methods and a callback function pointer when I try to connect two devices at same time in diffrent threads, my wrapper hangs when tryng to hook this callback function. I know that static stuff is thread shared, so I thinked about using different codeAppDomaincode for each FooWrapper istances.

Negative 72390 pIm working with some legacy code that I cannot edit that was originally compiled for and tested on PowerPC.  I am attempting to create a build system that will build it for generic linux box Ubuntu 11.10 x64.p  pIt has a custom interface similar to cblas that wraps an f2c version of the generic blas library included in clapack Ver. 3.2.1.  I.e. I compile liblapack, libblas and libf2c on the linux machine from the clapack source and link it with the following example codep  precodeint main      double a[3]  100,200,300      Scale all elements of a by 0.1      This uses a custom wrapper that seg. faults     mycblasdscal3,0.1,a,1   void mycblasdscalint N, double scale, double data, int inc      dscalint ampN, double ampscale, data, int ampinc  codepre  pcodemycblasdscalcode simply calls the blas library implementation codedscalcode.  However the library expects pointers for all data and this wrapper currently passes the address of codeNcode,codescalecode and codeinccode directly.  This scares me since they are passed by value and are often literals.p  pWhen executed codemycblasdscalcode often does nothing, i.e. codeacode is unchanged or it seg. faults.  With higher compiler optimizations e.g. gcc O3 it only ever seg. faults.p  pTo test the blas library, the following code works finep  precodeint main       This calls the library directly and works fine but I cannot edit      the rest of the code which is using the wrapped version above.     int size  3     double scale  0.1     int inc  1     dscalampsize,ampscale,a,ampinc  codepre  pMy only insight is something to do with the address and persistence of passbyvalue variables in the wrapper function since the seg. fault behavior gets worse with compiler optimizations.  I dont know enough to investigate further.  Any ideasp

Negative 72390 pAs discussed in Eric Lipperts blog post ema hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20091112closingovertheloopvariableconsideredharmful.aspx relnofollowClosing over the loop variable considered harmfulaem, closing over the loop variable in C can have unexpected consequences. I was trying to understand if the same gotcha applied to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiScala28programminglanguage29 relnofollowScalaa.p  pFirst of all, since this is a Scala question, Ill try explaining Eric Lipperts C example adding a few comments to his codep  precode Create a list of integers var values  new Listltintgt  100, 110, 120    Create a mutable, empty list of functions that take no input and return an int var funcs  new ListltFuncltintgtgt   For each integer in the list of integers were trying  to add a function to the list of functions  that takes no input and returns that integer  actually thats not what were doing and theres the gotcha. foreachvar v in values   funcs.Add gtv    Apply the functions in the list and print the returned integers. foreachvar f in funcs   Console.WriteLinef codepre  pMost people expect this program to print 100, 110, 120. It actually prints 120, 120, 120. The issue is that the code gt vcode function we add to the codefuncscode list closes over the v emvariableem, not vs emvalueem. As v changes value, in the first loop, all the three closures we add to the codefuncscode list see the same variable v, which by the time we apply them in the second loop has value 120 for all of them.p  pIve tried to translate the example code to Scalap  precodeimport collection.mutable.Buffer val values  List100, 110, 120 val funcs  Buffer[ gt Int]  forv lt values funcs   gt v funcs foreach  f gt printlnf   prints 100 110 120  so Scala can close on the loop variable with no issue, or can it codepre  pDoes Scala indeed not suffer from the same issue or have I just translated Eric Lipperts code badly and have failed to reproduce itp  pThis behavior has tripped many a valiant C developer, so I wanted to make sure there are no strange similar gotchas with Scala. But also, once you understand why C behaves the way it does, the output of Eric Lipperts example code kind of makes sense its the way closures work, basically so what is Scala doing differentlyp

Negative 72390 pI need advice about how Im supposed to be doing this.  I have a large application where all the code is on the main timeline in frame1.  Ive started trying to put the code in class files and telling certain movieclip components to use those class files for thier code.  So far I am mostly sucessful but perhaps this is not how I should be doing it.  p  pMain timeline has 8 buttons on it named O1 through O8.  I then have a movieclip component in my library which has its own set of O1 through O8 buttons inside it.  This component has been added to the stage it its own layer and given the instance name battleDashboard.  I used to access the buttons like this when it was all one big chunk of code no clases.  p  pO1                    button on the main time line in the main interface battleDashboard.O1    button inside battleDashboard componentp  pSince creating the class, Ive been accessing the buttos inside the component by using this.O1.  The class file is linked using the properties panel for the BattleDashboard movieclip component.  Its supposed to be called when a battle occurs and then return to the main interface, hiding itself when done.p  pBeing that Ive got over 10,000 lines of code in this app, I really want to have components have their own seperate code.  Im finding that I have to rewrite a lot of functions and include them in the class file that used to be shared.  I also have to spend time copying objects and variables using the public function set and then retreiving them afterwards using custom events.  Am I better off just leaving it all on the main timeline and just having external as files  p
Negative 72390 pI am new in the adsector, I have programmed two little ios games to test how useful ads are  and which revenue they earn.

Negative 72390 pIm using the Luminary LM3S8962 microcontroller and its included Library Guide, but this should be relevant to any ARM CortexM3s that have Nested Vector Interrupts.p  pYou can only register one interrupt service routine function with an entire GPIO Port. A GPIO port typically has 8 pins on it, each of which can be configured with an interrupt. For each pin, you can test whether or not an interrupt happened on it is pending, right and for each pin you can clear a pending interrupt, rightp  pIf a pin on the GPIO port triggers the ISR then the processor is in the ISR. Then what happens if another pin on the same port triggers an interrupt while were in the ISR We assume the code detects what pins have pending interrupts.  Is this ISR interrupted and a new one begins, with the same code, but an updated PinInterruptStatus register  I hope not  Is this ISR executed until completion, immediately executing the interrupt for the other pin right afterward I know ARM Cortex M3 implements tailchaining of interrupts  Or must there be a while loop that loops until all the pins have been cleared, clearing a pin after it has been processedp  pmaybe this will helpp  pa hrefhttpwww.ti.comlitgpnlm3s8962 relnofollowhttpwww.ti.comlitgpnlm3s8962ap

Negative 72390 pI am trying to step through a C project fossilscm that has a 2phase preprocessing stage.p  pFirst there is a custom built preprocessing program, that goes through the files and fixes certain projectspecific macros, creates the include headers, and a few other things. It creates a bunch of code.ccode and code.hcode files. The result is then compiled as usual, passing through the regular preprocessor.p  pI took the result from the first part and created a visualstudio project from it. When I tried to debug it, it was skipping my breakpoints. I found that every file begins with ap  precodeline 1 srcoriginalfilename.c codepre  pI can comment out this line and get debugging to work, but I would rather emuseem this line to get debugging in the original context.p  pSo...br How can I set it up so that it compiles the processed files, but uses the codelinecode directives to give me debugging capabilities in the original filesbr I tried just placing the codesrccode directory next to the files, and it works if I start the program by pressing codeF10code, but I dont know how to get the original files into the project explorer so that I can easily open them and place breakpoints without the compiler trying to compile them.p
Negative 72390 pI am testing a simple scenario that has a UITableViewController that has the cell segue to another UIViewController. Now during that segue, I need to pass some information to the UIViewController such as name and price of an item. I wanted to test the difference between using prepareForSegue and didSelectRowAtIndexPath to pass those 2 data points. It seems to work with the didSelectRowAtIndexPath but not prepareForSegue. After doing some debuggingp  p1I am wondering if prepareForSegue happens before any IBOutlet on the destinationViewController are initialized and so you cant effectively set them. So prepareForSegue seems to be more geared towards passing nonIBOutlet properties.p  p2If I am using a regular push segue, how can I access the segue.destinationViewController from the didSelectRowAtIndexPath method.p  pPS When testing the prepareForSegue, I am setting the segue in IB to push and when testing the didSelectRowAtIndexPath, I am setting the segue in IB to modal.p  pPS All resemblances to real names are incidentalp  precode   void prepareForSegueUIStoryboardSegue segue senderidsender      if [segue.identifier isEqualToStringitemDetailSegue]              NSIndexPath indexPath[self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow]          NSString theItemName[[self.itemsForSale objectAtIndexindexPath.row]objectForKeyName]         NSString theItemPrice[[self.itemsForSale objectAtIndexindexPath.row]objectForKeyPrice]          JuanDetailVC juanDetailVC JuanDetailVC segue.destinationViewController          juanDetailVC.itemName.texttheItemName         juanDetailVC.itemPrice.texttheItemPrice         void tableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      NSString theItemName[[self.itemsForSale objectAtIndexindexPath.row]objectForKeyName]     NSString theItemPrice[[self.itemsForSale objectAtIndexindexPath.row]objectForKeyPrice]      JuanDetailVC juanDetailVC JuanDetailVC self.presentedViewController      juanDetailVC.itemName.texttheItemName     juanDetailVC.itemPrice.texttheItemPrice   codepre  pThanksp

Negative 72390 pIm using CUDA 4.2 on a Quadro NVS 295 on a Win7 x64 machine. From the CUDA C Programming Manual I read thisp  pem...Streams are released by calling cudaStreamDestroy.emp  precodefor int i  0 i lt 2 i cudaStreamDestroystream[i] codepre  pemcudaStreamDestroy waits for all preceding commands in the given stream to complete before destroying the stream and returning control to the host thread.emp  pIs this really true I wrote a small code where I do more or less the following ill put only pseudocodep  precodetransfer input buffer to device cudaMemcpyToArrayAsync ... , stream[1]  launch kernel mykernel ltltltdimGrid, dimBlock, 0, stream[1]gtgtgt ...  transfer from device to host cudaMemcpyAsync.., cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream[1]  Destroy stream. In theory this should block the host until everything on the stream is completed ret  cudaStreamDestroystream[1]  codepre  pWith this example, it seems that the cudaStreamDestroy call immediately return to the host, i.e. not waiting for the cudaMemcpyAsync call and other strem instructions to finish. If I put a cudaStreamSynchronizestream[1] call befor destroying the stream, everything goes well but slower. So, what Im doing wrongp  pThank you very much for your responsesp

Negative 72390 pI am at a new company and I am building a wizard for a web app, .Net4.0. The user goes to a few separate screens during the wizard process and must return to the original screen before completion of the wizard. This is different from how they normally do this. But this is how it is TO BE DONE.p  pOne option is to store the result of each panel in the main screen in the DB. So then, when the user leaves amp redirects back. I could check for a querystring then call a datareader and populate original values appropriately.p  pThe option I chose I have created an object and I am storing the result of the user input into it. When users leave amp redirect back, check via querystring and populate control values via the BO.p  pI am storing the object in codeHttpContext.Current.Session.ItemBOcode and calling that.p  pMy question is, is that a bad way of doing this  If it isnt what things might I want to do to make sure that object is removed from the session no matter what when the user exits the wizard. If it is bad what would you do I am not afraid of constructive criticism, I am new at this.p

Negative 72390 pMy team got handed over some server side code in Java that generates random tokens and I have a question regarding the same p  pThe purpose of these tokens is fairly sensitive  used for session id, password reset links etc. So they do need to be cryptographically random to avoid somebody guessing them or brute force them feasibly. The token is a long so it is 64 bits long.p  pThe code currently uses the codejava.util.Randomcode class to generate these tokens. The documentation a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilRandom.htmlhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilRandom.htmla for codejava.util.Randomcode clearly states the following p  blockquote   pInstances of java.util.Random are not cryptographically secure. Consider instead using SecureRandom to get a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator for use by securitysensitive applications.p blockquote  pHowever, the way the code is currently using codejava.util.Randomcode is this  It instantiates the codejava.security.SecureRandomcode class and then uses the codeSecureRandom.nextLongcode method to obtain the seed that is used for instantiating the codejava.util.Randomcodeclass. Then it uses codejava.util.Random.nextLongcode method to generate the token.p  pSo my question now  Is it still insecure given that the codejava.util.Randomcode is being seeded using codejava.security.SecureRandomcode Do I need to modify the code so that it uses codejava.security.SecureRandomcode exclusively to generate the tokensp  pRegardsp  pEDIT Re Toms question  Currently the code seeds the codeRandomcode once at startupp
Negative 72390 pI have already put together code using the System.net.Webclient class to pull source code from a webpage, which I then use a string search on, to get specific information. This in itself works fine, but my issue is that the source code changes every few seconds, and I would like the data I have received to change accordingly. I understand that I could simply set up a loop to have this process repeat, but unfortunately my current code take a full 2.7 seconds to complete, and I would like to avoid this large lag time. In addition, I want to avoid spamming the webpage with requests if possible. I was thinking about a streamread that stays open, so that multiple requests wouldnt have to be sent, but I wasnt entirely sure how to go about this...p  pSo to sum it up, is there a way that I can pull updating information from a website using the System.Net namespace in a manner that is both fast, and avoids spamming the website with requestsp

Negative 72390 pIm building this application using PHP, MySQL and jQuery. Essentially its a checklist management application. p  pI have these checklists laid out as tables, much like a spreadsheet that can be edited asynchronously every time theres a change, its reported through an AJAX call to PHP which updates MySQL. p  pThe tricky part is that its possible for other people to be editing the same checklist at the same time, the content of the checklist is updated if jQuery notices a change between the JSON object it fires of an HTTP request periodically to ping the DB and the content in the HTML table row.p  pThis works fine for a limited number of items in my checklist, but when when my checklist numbers a considerable amount of rows, it kinda craps itself and lags out. I know that the inefficiency lays in the fact that every time an HTTP request is made for the most recent items in the checklist, I loop through every row in the HTML table and compare the contents of the row with the corresponding checklist item in the JSON object to see if there was a change.p  pI was wondering if theres a more efficient way to detect changes between my JSON object and what I have on the screen without looping through the DOMp  pEssentially, how do I keep a large dataset in sync asychronously with minimal DOM manipulationp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 72390 pI am attempting to code an iPhoneiPad screen that outputs a value based on what is entered in a text field and what is selected in a 2component picker. I have the basics done, right up to the point of having the enteredselected data appear, but short of performing the calculation. I have searched every resource I can find and have made use of all the relevant code I found, as you will see below.p  pSpecifically, I want to allow the user to enter a dollar amount in one text field, select what pay frequency hourly, monthly, etc it is, select what pay frequency they would like to convert it to, and see the results in the other text field when they tap a button. Another button would clear the fields, so they can convert another amount. More specifically, if they wanted to see what their weekly wage of 310 was semimonthly, they would enter 310 in the first field, select Weekly in the first picker component, select SemiMonthly in the other component, and tap the Calculate button. The other field would then show 671.67 310  52  24  671.67.p  pJust in case it is relevant, the View Controller this takes place on is tied to a Navigation Controller as one of 5 screens attached to one of 6 screens attached to the main View Controller it takes a couple of taps to get to this screen.p  pSo far, I can enter numbers into the two text fields and I can spin the 2 picker components and make their selections appear in labels, but thats where Im stuck. I can find no examples of how to implement it.p  pHere is my ViewController.h codep  precode    interface PayFrequencyViewController  UIViewController ltUIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSourcegt      UIPickerView payPicker     NSArray fromArray     NSArray toArray     NSArray fromValues     NSArray toValues     UILabel resultText     UITextField inputText  property strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UIPickerView payPicker property strong, nonatomic NSArray fromArray property strong, nonatomic NSArray toArray property strong, nonatomic NSArray fromValues property strong, nonatomic NSArray toValues property strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UILabel resultText property strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UITextField inputText  IBActionConvertidsender  IBActionClearidsender end codepre  pAnd here is my ViewController.m codep  precode    interface PayFrequencyViewController   end  implementation PayFrequencyViewController synthesize payPicker synthesize toArray synthesize fromArray synthesize toValues synthesize fromValues synthesize resultText synthesize inputText   idinitWithNibNameNSString nibNameOrNil bundleNSBundle nibBundleOrNil      self  [super initWithNibNamenibNameOrNil bundlenibBundleOrNil]     if self           Custom initialization          return self    voidviewDidLoad      self.fromArray  [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects                       Annual, Monthly, 48Year, SemiMonthly, BiWeekly, Weekly, Hourly, nil]      self.fromValues  [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects                         [NSNumber numberWithFloat1.0],                        [NSNumber numberWithFloat12.0],                         [NSNumber numberWithFloat48.0],                        [NSNumber numberWithFloat24.0],                         [NSNumber numberWithFloat26.0],                        [NSNumber numberWithFloat52.0],                         [NSNumber numberWithFloat2080.0], nil]       self.toArray  [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects                       Annual, Monthly, 48Year, SemiMonthly, BiWeekly, Weekly, Hourly, nil]      self.toValues  [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects                       [NSNumber numberWithFloat1.0],                      [NSNumber numberWithFloat12.0],                       [NSNumber numberWithFloat48.0],                      [NSNumber numberWithFloat24.0],                       [NSNumber numberWithFloat26.0],                      [NSNumber numberWithFloat52.0],                       [NSNumber numberWithFloat2080.0], nil]       [super viewDidLoad]     inputText.keyboardType  UIKeyboardTypeDecimalPad      Do any additional setup after loading the view.    voidviewDidUnload      [super viewDidUnload]      Release any retained subviews of the main view.      e.g. self.myOutlet  nil     self.toArray  nil     self.fromArray  nil     self.resultText  nil     self.inputText  nil    BOOLshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationinterfaceOrientation      return YES    NSIntegernumberOfComponentsInPickerViewUIPickerView pickerView       return 2    NSIntegerpickerViewUIPickerView pickerView numberOfRowsInComponentNSIntegercomponent       if component  0          return [fromArray count]          return [toArray count]    NSString pickerViewUIPickerView pickerView              titleForRowNSIntegerrow             forComponentNSIntegercomponent      if component  0          return [fromArray objectAtIndexrow]          return [toArray objectAtIndexrow]    voidpickerViewUIPickerView pickerView didSelectRowNSIntegerrow       inComponentNSIntegercomponent    IBActionConvertidsender       float valuein  [[fromValues text] floatValue]     float valueout  [[toValues text] floatValue]     [resultText setText[NSString stringWithFormat6.2f, result]]     [inputText resignFirstResponder]      float valuein  [[fromValues objectAtIndexrow] floatValue]     float valueout  [[toValues objectAtIndexrow] floatValue]     float input  [inputText.text floatValue]     float result  input  valuein  valueout     NSString resultString  [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat  , [toArray objectAtIndexrow]]    IBActionClearidsender      inputText.text       resultText.text      voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       [inputText resignFirstResponder]   end codepre  pMy apologies for the lengthy post and the improperly formatted code.

That website apparently runs on PHP too, so Id suggest that it is indeed possible to get the GPS data out of there using PHP.p  pI have tried googling the error message but all I get is some old 2005 or 2007 PHP bug, and a similar stackoverflow thread that noone answered  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10075066issuesextractingexifdataforexif23usingphpversion529Issues extracting exif data for exif 2.3 using PHP Version 5.2.9a.p  pSo... any ideasp

Negative 72390 pI just got a PermGen OOM in an Eclipse 3.6 development runtime, caused by the fact that I forgot to add the required startup parameters. Before noticing that I thought something else was wrong so I fired up JVisualVM and got the following screenshot out of itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfOfbo.png altOOM Permgenp  pUsed is almost equals to Size, but Max is still a bit bigger. Id expect an OOM if Used is approaching Max, not Size. The only vague explanation I have is that the JVM tries to allocate 2x the Used space which is bigger than Max. But still Id be thankful for comments.p

I cant instantiate the PackageReciever Android does that for me because its in the manifest. p  pI tried creating a new broadcast, so my PackageReceivers onReceive function looks like thisp  precodeOverride public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent      String action  intent.getAction     if action.equalsIntent.ACTIONINSTALLPACKAGE              action.equalsIntent.ACTIONPACKAGEADDED              action.equalsIntent.ACTIONPACKAGECHANGED          logger.debugCaught action of type   action          Intent i2  new Intent         i2.setActionMY.CUSTOM.ACTION         context.sendBroadcasti2        codepre  pThen, over in my main activity, I created a new BroadcastReceiverp  precodeBroadcastReceiver myReceiver  new BroadcastReceiver      Override     public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent          logger.warnI made it HOORAY       codepre  pAnd registered that receiver in the onResume and unregistered in the onPause function, like thisp  precodeOverride protected void onResume      IntentFilter filter  new IntentFilter     filter.addActionMY.CUSTOM.ACTION     registerReceivermyReceiver, filter     logger.debugRegistering receiver in onResume.     super.onResume  codepre  pIt sounded like a nice solution, but myReceiver never has its onRecieve function called. Ive tried making sure I dont unregister when I dont want to by simply removing the unregistration, moving the registration to the onCreate method of the activity, and none of that works. The net result there is that exceptions get thrown in the logger saying Ive leaked an IntentFilter, Did you forget to unregister No, I very purposefully didnt unregister... but... nevermind.p  pIm running out of ideas as to how to bridge this gap. Also, I cant just poll the installed applications and check version numbers. For reasons I cant get into here, we dont use version numbers. I need to know whether or not the user completed the installation that I kicked off.p  pHow can I send information from the PackageReceiver to the main activity Or, how can I catch the result of the installation in the main activity itselfp  pThanks to all who give it a stab. I checked other stackoverflow questions, but none seem to have the answers Im looking for.p

Negative 72390 pstrongSummarystrongp  pWhat are the pros and cons of splitting pure functions into passive objects that describe the algorithms and active objects that can execute those algorithms Note that the situation is greatly simplified by the fact that the functions have no side effects.p  pstrongDetailstrongp  pThe portion of the code Im writing in Python 3 will largely adhere to functional programming.p  pThere is some immutable data. There are some algorithms. And I need to apply those algorithms to the data, and get the result.p  pThe algorithms could be represented as regular functions, which will be transformed using standard operations e.g., I may compose two functions, then freeze some parameters using codefunctools.partialcode, then passed the resulting function to another function as an argument. Many of the lowerlevel functions would be memoized for performance reasons.p  pBut an idea occurred to me that perhaps I should instead represent algorithms as passive objects. Such objects wouldnt be able to execute anything themselves. When Im ready to execute, Ill feed the algorithm object and all the inputs it expects into a special computation object. This would match my mental model of an algorithms far better, but Im concerned that I might be missing some problems with this approach.p  pAlgorithm objects could be implemented in a variety of ways perhaps even multiple implementations could be allowed. Lets say my algorithms are instances of an abstract class Algorithm then its subclasses could representp  ul listrings of text in a domainspecific language that Ill create li lisome kind of execution trees that Ill constructli lieven regular Python functionsli ul  pI have never done this before, so I wanted to get some feedback on this idea. Does it offer any real design advantages, apart from my subjective feeling that its more natural Does it lead to any problemsp

Negative 72390 pI am trying to apply conditional formatting to my pivot table, but cant seem to get it right despite a lot of research.p  pLets say there is the following raw data rangetable describing how much different sales agents have sold per year broken down into product categoriesp  pstrongsales agentstrong  strongyearstrong  strongproductstrong  strongsales amountstrongp  pThe respective pivot table would have strongsales agentstrong as a row, strongyearstrong and strongproductstrong as columns and strongsales amountstrong as the value field.p  pNow I would like to apply conditional formatting to the value fields depending on a yearonyear comparison. As an example, if the strongsales agent Astrong has sold more strongcar insurancestrong in strong2012strong compared to strong2011strong, then the respective cell sales agent A, 2012, car insurance should be coloured in green.p  pMoreover this should also work on a subtotals basis, i.e. if the total sales volume of strongsales agent Astrong in strong2012strong is higher than in strong2011strong, then the respective cell strongsales agent Astrong, strong2012strong should be green as well.p  pI tried to use relative references within the conditional formatting dialog, but this is quite static i.e. always using the previous column and doesnt work for all columns nor sub totals.p  pThe other option would obviously VBA, basically walking through the whole pivot table identifying the column and row headers and then using GetPivotData to determine the format. But I would like to avoid that.p

I suppose that in this design the average rating and comment retrieval is done by join queries or something similar.  Im a total noob in database design but I try to adhere to best practices , is this design more or less ok or am I overlooking something p  pI can definitely think of other possibilities  maybe comment andor rating can be an entitytable by itself and the relationships are between 3 entities.

But I doubt this is not the correct approach. I believe there could be any other approach for this. Besides if table grows huge there could be performance issues because of increase in joins and also sql queriesp  pIs creating widest possible table with all possible attributes as columns is right approach Please let me know.

Negative 72390 pI have a codeImageViewcode that contains two bitmaps a background and a pattern painted on the foreground. What I want to do is erase the pattern painted on the foreground so that the full background is revealed on the erased parts. The erasing part I have figured out and this works. p  pMy problem is that when I erase the touch position is inaccurate. This is because the codeBitmapcode on the foregrounds canvas isnt the same size as the codeImageViewcodes canvas.

This is bad from a performance perspective since A we already have the files contents in memory and B there are are large number of bottomlevel directories, so were forced to reload and reparse the same common files multiple times.p  pWhat Id like to do is emparseem every LESS file in phase one, and then merge the ASTs as necessary during phase two.p  pIn order to do this, I need to prevent LESS from evaluating codeimportcode nodes during parsing.  Then in phase 2, I can manually find the codeimportcode nodes in the AST and merge in the alreadyparsed ASTs recursively, since they can include their own codeimportcodes.p

And the difference between my best answer and the two very fast answers below seems to be their use of codeforeachcode inside the codewhile loopcode to assign values directly to the main codedatacode array. PHP strongfunction calls are supposedly expensivestrong, and this example seems to prove that strongthey really arestrong. Both of the best answers gave me results in under 300 milliseconds. My best answer only worked fast when I filtered out numeric values, otherwise it ran into 30 second server timeout.p  pSo, I guess if you are processing massive amounts of data, use emconstructsem and emnot functionsem whenever you can.p  pNote about the yes I know theyre deprecated mysql functions One answer suggested that I use codemysqlfetchassoccode instead of codemysqlfetcharraycode. Actually, codemysqlfetchrowcode is supposed to be fastest, but the change made absolutely no difference in the speed of page loading with this data set about 48,000 results. I also tried using codemysqlresultcode. The PHP docs say that its slower when retrieving multiple rows, and it is a lot slower.p  pThis took 6.27 seconds to load, versus about 0.27 seconds 270 milliseconds for the similarly structured best answer.p  precodei0 whiledataparts  explode,mysqlresultresult,i,0      i     ifi gt 99999          break          foreachdataparts as value          data[value]  1       data  arraykeysdata codepre

This went on and on with several refresh cycles going through 100 or so threads of 100 CPU.  Finally it settled down with a dozen or so Java threads each had about 10 CPU time.

Negative 72390 pIm running into issues when using the VelocityTracker class. Velocity tracking seems to work very well if you are measuring the velocity of touch events on a nonmoving view, but as soon as the view starts moving with your finger using using translateYX or setYX, the velocity is completely random I think the velocity is calculated using the views position. Does anyone have any suggestions for getting an accurate velocity of your movement when swiping a viewp  pNotes I am using the touch events from my Views onTouchListener for Velocity tracking. p  pCheersp

Negative 72390 pI feel like what I am trying to do should be really easyand it is making me feel dumb, but since I cant figure it out I think I am miss understanding how HTTP POST.p  pHere is how I think should happen The controller creates QuoteDimensionViewModel QDVM then sends it to the view. The View creates webpage which contains the textboxes for various variables in the model. The user fills in those textboxes. The user clicks the buttom which generates the HTTP post, then the model is updated with the new values from the textbox and sent to the controller. The controller does it stuff and we all live happily ever after.p  pHere is what I think is happening When the user hits the button and a new QuoteDimensionViewModel is being created and only the values with text boxes associated with them are getting filled. So in this case I dont have a textbox for the variable Eid, so the value for Eid could be 5 in the Get but when Post the value is always 0. This causes a problem when trying to Validate the Data with IValidatableObject.p  pstrongTLDRstrong I basically want to send a model with X variables to a view, then change Y of those variables.

If I decrease the width from 25 to something lower, it will fit, but if I scale the page, they will still wrap, as the div on the right hits the rightmost table cell.p  pHow should I setup the layout to keep them inside the divp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltstyle typetextcssgt             html,body, div                  display block                 height 100                 width 100                               container                  position absolute                 height 300px                 width 100                          .sideBySide                  position absolute                 float left                 height 100                           galleria                  backgroundcolor0C0                 left 0px                 right 300px                 width auto                           tagit                  backgroundcolor 099                 right 0px                 width 300px                           table                  position absolute                 margin 0px                 padding 0px                 display table                 height 100                 width 100                           .tablerow                  position relative                 margin 0px                 padding 0px                 display tablerow                 width 100                 height 25                           .tablecell                  position relative                 margin 0px                 padding 0px                 display tablecell                 float left                 height 100                 width 25                  padding 20px                           .kuva                  position relative                 margin 0px                 padding 0px                 width 100                 height 100                  backgroundcolor 999                       ltstylegt     ltheadgt      ltbodygt         ltdiv idcontainergt             ltdiv idgalleria classsideBySidegt                 ltdiv idtablegt                     ltdiv classtablerowgt                         ltdiv classtablecellgt                             ltdiv classkuvagtCell1ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                         ltdiv classtablecellgt                             ltdiv classkuvagtCell2ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                         ltdiv classtablecellgt                             ltdiv classkuvagtCell3ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                         ltdiv classtablecellgt                             ltdiv classkuvagtCell4ltdivgt                                                ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt              ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 72390 pSo I want to execute a bash command from PHP on my web server. I can do this using codeshellexeccode. However, one of the commands I want to execute is codecurlcode. I use it to send a code.wavcode file to another server and record its response. But when invoked from PHP, codecurlcode doesnt work.p  pI reduced the error to the following small example. I have a script named codephpscript.phpcode which containsp  precodeltphp vershellexeccurl F fileuploads201372417314329097flash.wav httpotherserver echo ver codepre  pThe curious thing is that when I run this php script from command line using codephp phpscript.phpcode, the result I get is p  precodeStatus 500 Internal Server Error Contenttype texthtml codepre  pHowever, if I run codecurl F fileuploads201372417314329097flash.wav httpotherservercode directly, I get the response I was expectingp  precodeverdict  authentic codepre  pEdit I should probably mention that if I put some bash code inside the codeshellexeccode argument which does not contain codecurlcode, the bash command executes fine. For example, changing the line to codever  shellexececho hello gt worldcode puts the word hello into the file world provided it exists and is writable. End edit.p  pSomething is blocking the execution of curl when it is invoked from PHP. I thought this might be PHPs running in safe mode, but I found no indication of this in php.ini. Is there a way to test this to make 100 sure Whats blocking curl and, more importantly, how can I bypass or disable this blockp  pAnd yes, I realize PHP has a curl library. However, I prefer to use commands I can run from the command line as well, for debugging purposes.p  pcheers, Alanp

Negative 72390 pIm code reviewing a WCF service. In the header of each message we inject data that the service is going to use later to build a connection string to a DB. Thats because the service is going to be used by a number of different sites, each with its own DB that the service has to query.  We use wcf extensibility. We have a custom MessageInspector that, after receiving the request, extracts the data from the message header, creates a context that implements IExtension and adds it to OperationContext.Current.Extensions. Before sending the reply the custom context is removed from the Extencions collection.p  pThis is a fairly common pattern, as discussed herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1895732wheretostoredataforcurrentwcfcallisthreadstaticsafeWhere to store data for current WCF call Is ThreadStatic safeap  pand herep  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS319cac6666e84dfe9a82dfd289c9df1fwcfdoesnthavesessionstoragesowhereshouldonestorecallspecificdataforumwcfhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS319cac6666e84dfe9a82dfd289c9df1fwcfdoesnthavesessionstoragesowhereshouldonestorecallspecificdataforumwcfap  pThis all works fine as long as the service receives a request, processes it, sends the reply and receives the next request. But what if the service receives a request and before being able to reply it gets a second request I built a small console application to test it. I send 2 messages from 2 different threads, I made the wcf service wait for 2 seconds, to ensure the second request comes in before the first one is completed and this is what I getp  pSite Id  test1450  Session uuid2caf47cf7d464d729275d9c037fa0e70id2  Thread Id 6p  pSite Id  test1450  Session uuid2caf47cf7d464d729275d9c037fa0e70id3  Thread Id 22 p  pIt looks like wcf creates 2 sessions executing on 2 different threads, but Site Id is the same. It shouldnt. Judging from this it looks like OperationContext.Current.Extensions is a collection shared between threads.  Right now Im inclined to think my test is wrong and I missed something.p  pHas anyone tried something similar and found out that OperationContext.Current is not thread safep

In the initialization code.pep.pepcode I would like to assign codeconstrainTocode to peps grandparent element, of class pepgrandparent. Since the grandparent size can change, I want a dynamic assignment of codeconstrainTocode.p  pThe a hrefhttpsgithub.combriangonzalezjquery.pep.js relnofollowdocumenteda option for codeconstrainTocode is parent or an array [top, right, bottom, left].

If I resize the browser note the  width spec in css  an artifice for dynamic behavior the pep remains constrained to its old codeconstrainTocode.

Negative 72390 pPlease helpp  pI work for a telecoms company, everyday I receive stacks of emails from our ISP notifying me a customer is about to exceed there broadband data allowance. I am then required to contact each customer manually and inform them of the situation and advise a recommended solution. p  pThe strongproblemstrong is this is they are coming in quicker than I can contact customers. p  pWhat I would like to do is automate this process The email from the ISP can not be forwarded as it contains confidential information.p  pThe system would need to extractscrape the following datap  ul liTelephone number, current data usage, data reset date. li ul  pThis extracted data would need to be extracted into an email template. p  pIt gets trickier  Now the system would need to establish which customer to send this email toop  pThe only way to identify a customer from the information contained in the email is the telephone number. I guess I would need to create a directory with each telephone number and associated customer email address. p  pIs this impossible to achieve How would you guys go about achieving something like this Any advice would be massively appreciated  In fact you would be a life saver. p  pThanks, p  pChris  p
Negative 72390 pIve been bumping my head against the good old, p  precodeTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSGenericException, reason  Collection ltNSArrayM 0x14d5e120gt was mutated while being enumerated. codepre  pIve had to contend with this a couple of times before and usually its fairly easy to identify where the offending code is. Only in this current case, Ive checked everywhere in my code and cant find which array it is talking about.p  pSo my question is is there any tool or debugger command I can use to help me pinpoint where in my code this thing is blowing up I see the address of the array, but I dont know how to resolve this into a location in the code, if thats even possible at all.p

Negative 72390 plets say some blocking IO is done in Java such as a long running db query. Is there in general a way in Java that some Java database driver can tell the JVM scheduler that the call has left the JVM and is now being processed by some external system The JVM could then assign the thread that served the db query for some other operation until the reply from the db has arrived. This way the blocking db query would effectively become nonblocking. p  pJust wonder whether this can be done on the JVM in general. I do Java for many years now, but I admittedly dont know what the Java scheduler is doing in such a situation.p

Negative 72390 pI am passing an array from my MVC5 EF6 controller to the view. When I assign the object to a javascript var, the compiler issues a 314 sytax error. The code works fine, so it is not a big deal however, I cannot publish my webapp because of it. I have to exclude the offending view and then publish separately. The pesky line of code causing this trouble isp  precodevar sizeArray  Html.RawJson.EncodeViewBag.Sizes codepre  pEnclosing the thing in quotes doesnt help because JSON.parse throws a fit of illegal characters.

I can combat this by overriding some CSSp  precode.revealmodal      padding 0     maxwidth 950px  always will be maximum image width      background transparent  codepre  pHowever I cant figure out a good way to center the popup horizontally in the window after doing this.

Negative 72390 pIve had a discussion with collegues this morning concerning forloopoptimization. It was pretty much the situation as described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5116188cforloopoptimizationquestionthis questiona, however the code was CCLI and the method called a property emfrom a different assemblyem. Im aware that in this case the compiler cant optimize the loop by inlining the function. However, the subject was image processing and the properties called were width and height of an image, i.e.p  precodefor unsigned int y  0 y lt image.Height y      for unsigned int x  0 x lt image.Width x           Do something with pixel x,y       codepre  pFor a 5M grayscale image, that loop took about 450 ms, whereas when saving width and height to local variables before executing the loop, the time consumption was about 10 ms These numbers are only given to show the magnitude of the difference.p  pOf course, we are heading for the local variable solution now, but I wonder whether the naive forloop given above is actually bad design When writing such code, I wouldnt expect any real compiler optimization, but calls to emtrivialem properties like width and height of an image Id expect to return their value way quicker. So isnt the whole problem due to bad design of the image library authors When using trivial properties, shouldnt I prever readabilityp
Negative 72390 pMy two entities are Book and Category. A book can have many categories, and a category can have many books.

In other wordsp  precodeBook book  [Book insertNewObjectIntoContextcontext] Category category  [Category insertNewObjectIntoContextcontext] [book addCategories[NSSet setWithObjectcategory]] BOOL result  [category.books containsObjectbook]  Should be YES codepre  pYet, I get codeNOcode in my app. codebookscode returns an empty set.p  pI triplechecked that the relationships are marked as inverse. What else could be at play here Or is there something Im missingp  pWould it hurt if I set the inverse relation manually If I do everything works like a charm.p
Negative 72390 pIm currently developing a site that uses the checked variable to apply rules to the CSS. Ive got a checkbox input that when triggered, should accomplish two things. The first thing it should do is expand a div from a height of 0 to 200 when checked, and back to 0 when unchecked. I had no problems with triggering that first task. The second thing that ishouldi be accomplished upon checking the box, is a transform rotate45deg of a div with a bb in it that should rotate 45 degrees into an bxb not an actual x, but a rotated .p  pIve currently got my code setup to display the animation on hover, but thats just for illustrative purposes, that wouldnt be in my final code. So hover over the bb to see what Im trying to accomplish with the checked input.p  pIf youre willing to take a look at my a hrefhttpcodepen.iomtthwbckmnpenActwn relnofollowcodea, and tell me what Im doing wrong, Id be greatly appreciative Let me know if you have any questions.p  pbNote Ideally Im looking for a pure CSS solution without the need for JS.

Negative 72390 pI have defined a range of cells as a table in Excel 2010.  I keep the sheet protected so that other users cannot mistakenly alter formulas.  Ive had to use a macro tied to a button to allow other users to add rows when the sheet is locked.

Negative 72390 pI have a system of cities and events that happen in those cities.  When a user creates an event, it is associated with a city, and therefore a time zone.  Im confused about Rubys various implementations Date, Time, DateTime and how to handle the saving and displaying of event times relative to a citys time zone.p  pI have a datetime column in my database.  My HTML form has a field for city and therefore that citys time zone and I use datetimeselect to give the user fields to enter the events date and time.  The idea is that if the user has selected Seattle, and then a time of 7pm on April 1, the user should not have to worry about time zones at all, and the assumption is that they are setting it for 7pm Seattle time.  I want to either save this datetime as UTC after making the adjustment from Seattle time to UTC or apply the Seattle time zone to it without altering the specified hour.  Since I am using mass assignment when I save my form data to the database, Im guessing I need to alter the data adjusting for time zone before saving, otherwise, it will assume that this 7pm time is already UTC, which of course it isnt.p  pWhen I display this information from the database, it will be in the context of a time zone, so when displaying this event, the system knows it is in Seattle and will therefore show 7pm as the original user who created the event intended.p  pHow should I handle this  What implementation should I use Date, Time, DateTime, and what conversions should be done on saving and loading the data from the database so users always see local timesp

On my laptop one such file with only 730 records is taking about a minute to do its stuff.p  pI did consider making the insert   ... on duplicate key update into a prepared statement inside the SP but some of the other tables have many more fields and I could find no good guide on how to write such a complex one.p  pHere is my stored procedurep  precodeDROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS impLuRacodes DELIMITER  CREATE DEFINERrootlocalhost PROCEDURE impLuRacodes   BEGIN DECLARE done INT DEFAULT 0 DECLARE vATID varchar10 DECLARE vCode varchar10 DECLARE vIssType varchar10 DECLARE vCategory varchar10 DECLARE vCNumber int4 DECLARE vCDesc varchar255 DECLARE vColCode varchar6 DECLARE vLLike int3 DECLARE vLifeS int3 DECLARE vPropS int3 DECLARE vBusS int3 DECLARE c1 CURSOR FOR       SELECT ATID, Code, IssType, Category, CNumber, CDesc, ColCode, LLike, LifeS, PropS, BusS       FROM luracodestemp DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done1 OPEN c1 REPEAT    FETCH c1 INTO vATID, vCode, vIssType, vCategory, vCNumber,                    vCDesc, vColCode, vLLike, vLifeS, vPropS, vBusS    INSERT INTO luracodes  ATID, Code, IssType, Category, CNumber,                 CDesc, ColCode, LLike, LifeS, PropS, BusS     VALUESvATID, vCode, vIssType, vCategory, vCNumber, vCDesc,            vColCode, vLLike, vLifeS, vPropS, vBusS     ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE            ATID vATID, Code vCode, IssType vIssType, Category vCategory,            CNumber vCNumber, CDesc vCDesc, ColCode vColCode, LLikevLLike,            LifeS vLifeS, PropS vPropS, BusS vBusS UNTIL done END REPEAT  CLOSE c1 END  codepre  pAlternatively, is it possible to put the Select inside the Insert ...

I have only one spam bot tracing me ten times a day with the same spam mail. I have even added a mandatory check box to validate that the user is not a bot. Is there an alternative option besides Captcha Maybe someway to block this one user The bots email address is invisible in my emails. I do not want to add Captcha, because it will ruin the cohesiveness to my website as well as become a pain in the butt for my users, as no one I have met enjoys tracking that annoying photo. p  pwww.thesunkenweb.com is my website for reference. p  pThanks for the help everyone Happy codings to you all...p

Negative 72390 pI am using codeNLopt librarycode, codeCOBYLA algorithmcode, in C for minimizing a log based cost function. I have already implemented the same using codefmincomcode in Matlab. The Matlab function performs much better than codeNLoptcode. It requires a much smaller number of optimizations than NLopt and also converges to a minimum value much better than NLopt.p  pI believe that the supplementary options used for the algorithms are different. I have tried to copy the same parameters for NLopt as for the default in fmincon in Matlab and it still does not give similar results.p  pI need to know how to converge in a fashion similar to Matlab, if it is possible, using COBYLA in NLopt.

Negative 72390 pI have a question about a possible fix for airspace issue in wpf. By airspace i mean the problem of using wpf and win32 windows at the same time and the fact that win32 windows come on top always.p  pI have a win32 window that I want to incorporate into my wpf app. But I want to use all the fancy wpf stuff there also like putting something above it etc...p  pI know this is not possible because of airspace issues. p  pMy win32 window is only a video window so it has no keyboard or mouse active parts. So my idea was to copy window content periodically using PrintWindow win32 function into some memory space where I would pick it up using Interopbitmap then I could use that interopbitmap as a source.p  pAlso I would hide that win32 window so its not showing supposedly printwindow works off hidden windows.p  pUnfortunately I dont know much about win32 programming so I failed so far. Does anyone else have experience with this Or maybe has another solution for escaping the airspace issuesp  pI was doing something like thisp  precodethis.dispatcher  Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher Utilities.GetClientRectthis.hwnd, out rect  width  rect.Right height  rect.Bottom  this.dc  Utilities.CreateCompatibleDCIntPtr.Zero this.hBitmap  Utilities.CreateCompatibleBitmapdc, width, height Utilities.SelectObjectthis.dc, this.hBitmap this.BitmapSource  InteropBitmapImaging.CreateBitmapSourceFromHBitmapthis.hBitmap, IntPtr.Zero, Int32Rect.Empty, System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapSizeOptions.FromEmptyOptions codepre  pand then periodically from another thread 5 times per second i did thisp  precodeUtilities.PrintWindowthis.hwnd, dc, WindowPart.Client this.dispatcher.BeginInvokeDispatcherPriority.Render, Actionthis.BitmapSource.Invalidate codepre  pI just got a black screen so that obviously doesnt work.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 72390 pIm new to both Angular and Dart, and Im writing an app which has categories that are hierarchical.  This is represented by their IDs being a slashdeliminated list of the path to that category including its parents  in other words, category1 for toplevel category, category1category2 for a child, category1category2category3 for a grandchild.p  pId like my URL scheme to reflect this hierarchy ie for category2, categoriescategory1category2.p  pThis is my current RouteInitializerFn Im then pulling out the categoryId parameter in the controller for categoriesp    pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodevoid routeInitializerRouter router, RouteViewFactory views    views.configure     subcategories  ngRoute         path categoriescategoryId,         viewHtml ltcategoriesgtltcategoriesgt,     ,     categories ngRoute         path categories,         viewHtml ltcategoriesgtltcategoriesgt,     ,     codepre  pThis appears to trip up on the slashes, though the value of categoryId for URL categoriescategory1category2 is category1.p  pThe AngularJS docs suggest this is possible in JS land a hrefhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgapingRouteprovider relnofollowhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgapingRouteproviderarouteProvider  the docs for the path parameter Ive tried changing my path to various permutations of whats there without any luck, nor can I find anything relevant in the issue tracker.p  pAny thoughtsp  pEditp  pOK, think Ive figured this out. The culprit is a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularroute.dartblobmasterliburltemplate.dartL6 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comangularroute.dartblobmasterliburltemplate.dartL6a  specifically, the regex which matches the value of a parameter is any character except the start of a string or  at least once. I think the fix is to change that regex to be r. all the old unit tests still pass, as do the new ones I hacked up.p  pUnfortunately it doesnt look like theres a temporary workaround. You cant swap in a different implementation of UrlMatcher because the use of UrlTemplate is baked into the ngRoute method if one were to change NgRouteCfgs path parameter to be a dynamic type and assert it was either a String or a UrlMatcher which is what the innards of routehierarchical does, so you could pass it straight through that would also be a reasonable solution, but for the moment it looks like the path forward is to fix in head.p

Negative 72390 pIm writing a basic wrapper for the Webkit Storage API the new version of a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comchromewhitepapersstoragereference relnofollowthisa API for me to use. My current problem with it is the codequeryUsageAndQuotacode function.p  pMy wrapper around that particular function originally looked like thisp  precodeself.pers.getQuota  function      self.pers.queryUsageAndQuotafunctionusage,quota          return quota        self is a reference to the top level of this wrapper codepre  pHence, I would have called codevar quota  self.pers.getQuotacode and had the quota returned.p  pAfter that failed, I had a look at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14258744javascriptchainningreturnthisfromcallbackthis questiona and changed it so I used a userdefined callback instead. Now the function is thisp  precodeself.pers.getQuota  functioncallback      self.pers.queryUsageAndQuotafunctionusage,quota          callback.callquota       codepre  pHowever, executing this linep  precodeself.pers.getQuotafunctionquota      console.logquota  codepre  pshows codeundefinedcode in the log. I cant figure out why, because when I execute the underlying function codenavigator.webkitPersistentStorage.queryUsageAndQuotacode, I get the right number out of it.p

Negative 72390 pThis question is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19638773matplotlibplotslosetransparencywhensavingaspsepscomment2916137519640319a comment on another questiona.p  pIn matplotlibpython, I am trying to rasterize a specific element in my image and save it to eps. The issue is that when saving to EPS but not SVG or PDF, a black background appears behind the rasterized element.p  pSaving to PDF and converting to EPS does not seem to be a reasonable solution, as there are weird pdf2ps and pdftops conversion issues that make understanding bounding boxes very ... scary or worse, seemingly inconsistent.

Negative 72390 pWas hoping someone could help with this please Ive scanned through the forum and apple docs and cant find anything that matches my problem exactly.p  pIm trying to animate a custom Composite UIView derived class with overidden drawRect by changing a custom colour property emnotem one of the standard view properties like centre, alpha, backgroundColour etc, calling setNeedsDisplay and redrawing the view using drawRect over X seconds duration to produce a slow colour change from say, red to blue.p  pAt the moment, all CompositedrawRect does internally is clear the context the view has a default background colour set to clear and fill the view using the colour provided. This works fine the first time its called  the view appears on screen in the correct red colour.p  pMy problem is that when I try to animate the view by updating the colour property, even though drawRect is being called everytime I call setNeedsDisplay and the colour being fed into the view instance is correct the view doesnt update emon screenem until I stop calling setNeedsDisplay or rather, stop updating the custom view colour property. Its like every call to setNeedsDisplay pushes the view to the back of a list so it doesnt get updated on screen until it stops getting called even though drawRect is being called.p  pFor example  trying to change the colour from red to blue over 10 seconds, the view stays red for 10 seconds, then turns to blue in a single frame at the end of the property changing and presumably when I stop calling setNeedsDisplay rather than a slow fade between the two over the time duration.p  pAny ideas whats going on Im guessing I need to animate this using apples own animation property stuff but Id really prefer not to  Im trying to make this cross platform if possible and I dont see why my own method shouldnt work.p  pThe basicsp  pIn case it matters, my composite view instance is a subview of an UIImageView. I know imageview drawRect doesnt get called but I cant imagine this is a problem for its subviews  after all, my CompositedrawRect is definitely being called.p  pIm setting the right colour on my view instance  Ive debug printed this to be sure  so the colour provided to the view goes from red to blue over however many seconds  frames.p  pIm setting setNeedsDispay and drawRect is being called every time  again, debug printing confirms this.p  pThis is happening over multiple frames and the app goes through the drawing update at the end of every frame  I.e Im not blocking the render thread or anything  the app runs fine, it just doesnt update the view on screen even though its drawRect is being called, until I stop manipulating the property. Someone mentioned a similar problem where they were blocking the render thread in a single frame but Im definitely not doing anything like that.p  pIve tried messing around with the following but they all produced the same results i.e. view changed from red to blue in a single frame rather than a slow change over.p  ul lipUpdating the colour every frame but only calling setNeedsDisplay on my view every Xth frame 5, 10, 20, 30 etcpli lipUpdating the colour every frame but not calling setNeedsDisplay unless the corresponding drawRect call from the last setNeedsDisplay has happened i.e. set a flag to false in SetColour func, set same flag to true in drawRect, test against it when decided to call setNeedsDisplay  same results.pli lipsetting the view bounds with ContentMode set to redraw to force an update  same resultspli liptried calling setNeedsDisplay on the parent image view too  no change.pli ul  pIm guessing that this just isnt possible  can anyone explain why its not updating the v view onscreen even though drawRect is being called Any ideas how I should do this I dont think I would be able to do what I want to do if I tried animated one of the default view properties using apples internal animation system but if Ive got to use that....p  pThanksp  pp

However, I need to use this in our Symfony2 project. Symfony2 obviously relies on namespaces a lot.

I develop on Windows and because my project is supposed to be multiplatform, Ive set up Jenkins build server which builds using a Linux slave machine automatically after each push.p  pNow what I needbr Quite often the build on Linux does not work, because Im using treat warnings as errors and gcc gives different warnings than MSVC. Then I need to fix the build and I dont want to mess the repository with fixing commits often more commits are needed to fix all gcc warnings. It would be ok for me to have a single commit in the repo for a fix of the linux build.p  pI thought I could just clone the repository to a fixing repo like a branch using clone and do as many fixing commits as needed. Then just merge all these commits to the main repo as a single fixing commit. But then I need to make my fixing repo public i.e. clone the fixing repo to the remote server to allow jenkins to build the sources. But how to get rid of the fixing repo when the fix is finished It is probably not a good idea to allow users delete remote repositories, is itp  pPossibilities I seebr 1 forgot about branching using clone, do a named branch, fix, merge to master branch and close the fixing branch  strongprobably not a common solution in mercurial to create a named branch for thisstrongbr 2 just create a new head possibly set a bookmark, fix, merge to master head branch and close the fixing head can I close a head  strongbetter but I still have to do with all fixing commits in the main repositorystrongbr 3 using the cloned fixing repo, set up ssh access or even mercurialserver for Jenkins to my personal machine and let it clone from it, build and when the build is fixed, just merge all commit from local fixing repo to remote repository as a single commitp  pSome better solution Or do I want to do something unusualbr Thanks.p

Before we were usingp  precodelibxslt Version gt 1.1.26  libxslt compiled against libxml Version gt 2.7.8  libexslt Version gt 1.1.26 codepre  pSince the upgradep  precodelibxslt Version gt 1.1.28   libxslt compiled against libxml Version gt 2.9.1    libexslt Version gt 1.1.28   codepre  pMy hunch is that its now treating the XHTML as XML as opposed to HTML, which it did previously, and the XMl doesnt allow multiple ID values.p  pMy question is, has anyone seen this before or know what might be causing it, and whats the appropriate steps to either revert it or force it to ignore multiple id valuesp  pThere is no real option at this stage to roll back the changes so the server admin people say or to fix the websites as it would take too long. p  pAny ideas appreciated.p  hr  pstrongEDIT NOV 24 2014strong Looks like its an issue in libxml v2.9.1, and not a libxslt issue like I originally thought. I presume downgrading the version of libxml to lt v2.9.1 and recompile will work if you have that option to available to you.p  pI have also logged a bug report to xml[at]gnome.org p

Negative 72390 pI believe that when setting codepositionfixedcode on an item say navbar and codebodycode has codepositionrelative left150pxcode, the item fixed has no idea what it its supposed to do.p  pFrom my understanding, codepositionfixedcode was fixed based on the window.  If that is true, then body with codeleftcode shouldnt effect the position of the sticky menu.p  pA button triggers the push of codebodycode and a menu comes out from the left.  When closed, the body slides back into place.p  pIn Firefox, this works perfectly, as I have coded it.p  pIn Chrome, the navbar moves to the right as intended, and the sticky menu moves with it, but when you close the push menu, the fixed navbar stays in place.  Hovering over it can fix it sometimes, resizing window always fixes it.  I tried adding a class to the code that forced it to the left.  It generally speaking, kind of worked.p  pIn Safari, as soon as you scroll with the push menu open, the navbar jumps back to the left wall and does NOT behave as expected. p  pHere is a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethv6f38za4 relnofollowJSFiddlea demonstrating the issue. p  pIs there a way to push the page without effecting fixed elementsp  pstrongWhat is required to resolve this issuestrongp  pThank you.p

Now we can simply use codeMyTypecode instead of the long template and the type will also be displayed in error messages instead of the expanded template name.p  pBut now there is one Problem Depending on the template used, we sometimes need a codetypenamecode in the codetypedefcode inside the macro. For example, if the used template is an inner template of a template parameter codeTcode, e.g.codeTLongNamelt...gtcode, then we would need the codetypenamecode in  the typedef, i.e.p  precode   typedef typename TMPLltVAARGSgt Base codepre  pOf course, I could create two macros, one with the codetypenamecode and one without. However, that is quite cumbersome. Instead, I would like to have a macro that always compiles correctly for both scenarios. Is this possiblep

Negative 72390 pWe have a report which uses one dataset to retrieve a list of sales personnell assigned to records. This is a list of names meeting the criteria in the dataset query.  Those names are used as a parameter for the main portion of the report.  An ondemand snapshot of the report was created and subscribed to monthly with a file going to a shared folder.  At the time the subscription was created the number of sales personnel for the parameter was 10. Two additional sales personnel came aboard and based on the query should be part of the parameter.  However the subscribed report does not appear to reflect them.  From reading it appears the subscription uses the parameters at the time the subscription was created and does not change. The end result is the exported report does not include data for additional sales personnel. Is there a way to handle this from the subscription level as we would not have knowledge of additional sales people coming aboard to constantly redo the snapshot and subscription. Thank you,p

Negative 72390 h2Backgroundh2  pFirst let me explain the background. I am working on a project that attempts to marry a backend server that uses Web API configured via OWIN hosted on IIS now, but potentially other OWINsupported hosts in the future to a frontend using AngularJS.p  pThe AngularJS frontend is entirely static content. I completely avoid serverside technologies such as MVCRazor, WebForms, Bundles, anything that has to do with the frontend and the assets it uses, and defer instead to the latest and greatest techniques using Node.js, GruntGulp, etc. to handle CSS compilation, bundling, minification, etc. For reasons I wont go into here, I keep the frontend and server projects in separate locations within the same project rather than stick them all in the Host project directly see crude diagram below.p  precodeMyProject.sln server   MyProject.Host      MyProject.Host.csproj      Startup.cs      etc. frontend   MyProjectApp      app.js      index.html      MyProjectApp.njproj      etc. codepre  pSo as far as the frontend is concerned, all I need to do is get my Host to serve my static content. In Express.js, this is trivial. With OWIN, I was able to do this easily using a hrefhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesMicrosoft.Owin.StaticFiles relnofollowMicrosoft.Owin.StaticFilesa middleware, and it works great its very slick.p  pHere is my codeOwinStartupcode configurationp  precodestring dir  AppDomain.CurrentDomain.RelativeSearchPath  get executing path string contentPath  Path.GetFullPathPath.Combinedir, ......frontendMyProjectApp  resolve nearby frontend project directory  app.UseFileServernew FileServerOptions      EnableDefaultFiles  true,     FileSystem  new PhysicalFileSystemcontentPath,     RequestPath  new PathStringstring.Empty  starts at the root of the host    ensure the above occur before map handler to prevent native static content handler app.UseStageMarkerPipelineStage.MapHandler codepre  h2The Catchh2  pBasically, it just hosts everything in codefrontendMyProjectAppcode as if it were right inside the root of MyProject.Host. So naturally, if you request a file that doesnt exist, IIS generates a 404 error.p  pNow, because this is an AngularJS app, and it supports a hrefhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgguidelocationhtml5mode relnofollowcodehtml5modecodea, I will have some routes that arent physical files on the server, but are handled as routes in the AngularJS app. If a user were to drop onto an AngularJS anything other than codeindex.htmlcode or a file that physically exists, in this example, I would get a 404 even though that route might be valid in the AngularJS app. Therefore, I need my OWIN middleware to return the codeindex.htmlcode file in the event a requested file does not exist, and let my AngularJS app figure out if it really is a 404. p  pIf youre familiar with SPAs and AngularJS, this is a normal and straightforward approach. If I were using MVC or ASP.NET routing, I could just set the default route to an MVC controller that returns my codeindex.htmlcode, or something along those lines. However, Ive already stated Im not using MVC and Im trying to keep this as simple and lightweight as possible.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25916851wrappingstaticfilemiddlewaretoredirect404errorsThis usera had a similar dilemma and solved it with IIS rewriting. In my case, it doesnt work because a my content doesnt physically exist where the rewrite URL module can find it, so it emalwaysem returns codeindex.htmlcode and b I want something that doesnt rely on IIS, but is handled within OWIN middleware so it can be used flexibly.p  h2TLDNR me, for crying out loud.h2  pSimple, how can I intercept a 404 Not Found and return the content of note emnotem redirect my codeFileServercodeserved codeindex.htmlcode using OWIN middlewarep

Negative 72390 pCurrently Im working on doctrine module for favorites which can be reusable in any project and for any entity.p  pHowever there is problem with JOINs. I followed a hrefhttpwww.theodo.frblog201311dynamicmappingindoctrineandsymfonyhowtoextendentities relnofollowthisa article about dynamic mappings and it works great.. Well almost.p  pIve got codeUsercode, codeArticlecode and codeFavoriteItemcode entities, where codeArticlecode entity can be added to favorites. Probably link to that github project with readme would be better a hrefhttpsgithub.comCarrooiNetteFavorites relnofollowlinka.p  pThe problem is mainly in a hrefhttpsgithub.comCarrooiNetteFavoritesblobd415319e3f625c6f7610c6f9bae052004fd22232srcModelFacadesFavoriteItemsFacade.phpL97 relnofollowthata method which should return codeFavoriteItemcode by codeUsercode and codeIFavoritableEntitycode, which in our example will be codeArticlecode. As you can see, that method uses native query, but is it possible to use DQL I know that I would have to use join to table without association, but it seems that doctrine can do that just for onetomanymanytoone associations.. Im right Or is there any other way how to do that in DQLp  pAlso do you think there is any way at all how to select in one query DQL all codeIFavoritableEntitiescode by one codeUsercode I just cant imagine any.p  pThank youp
Negative 72390 pArticles on React.js like to point out, that React.js is great for SEO purposes. Unfortunately, Ive never read, how you actually do it. Do you simply implement codeescapedfragmentcode as in a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingdocsgettingstartedhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingdocsgettingstarteda and let React render the page on the server, when the url contains codeescapedfragmentcode, or is there more to itp  pBeing able not to rely on codeescapedfragmentcode would be great, as probably not all potentially crawling sites e.g. in sharing functionalities implement codeescapedfragmentcode.p
Negative 72390 pIn MS Project, the Leveling functionality doesnt seem to work as I would expect for tasks with the As Late As Possible constraint. It seems to try to overallocate a resource by default to make tasks finish later than they actually emneedem to finish. Instead, I want the leveling functionality to account for other tasks when deciding the start and end dates. Its ok if some of them finish well before the deadline, as long as its As Late As Possible, accounting for the other tasks.p  pPlease see the this screenshot for an examplep  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comrprcUKI.png relnofollowLeveling Error and Gantt chartap  pNotice 202 is ok because no other tasks have deadlines before 202 starts. But 201, 200, and 205 conflict. Instead, I would want 200 to finish on 312, and 205 to finish before 200 starts no overlapp  pIs there some way I can adjust the settings to get this to work as I want it top

Negative 72390 pI am displaying a hrefhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5qtoolbutton.html relnofollowQToolButtonas with icon plus text ema hrefhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5qt.htmlToolButtonStyleenum relnofollowQtToolButtonTextBesideIconaem outside of a tool bar. Each button has a QtAction associated with it which determines the used icon and the displayed text. All those buttons are placed inside a a hrefhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5QGridLayout.html relnofollowQGridLayouta. So far so good. p  pUnfortunately, it looks like that as soon as you add a QAction to a QToolButton, Qt automatically decides to shrink it down to the minimal size, which is not what I want given my QGridLayout.

This size could then be applied to my QToolButton and the dummy button would be destroyed again. Is there a more elegant  reliable wayp

Negative 72390 pI am using python and Im experimenting with using generators as coroutines. Meaning that Im using the yield expression to pass values into the generator and then sending messages back and forth between various of these generator coroutines.p  pI am trying to chain together coroutines into a loop that iterates a value, whilst remaining open to new values originating from outside the loop. In other words, the loop should be nonblockingp  pThis is the loopp  precodecoroutineA gt val  yield gt does something to val gt coroutineB.sendotherval coroutineB gt val  yield gt does something to val gt coroutineC.sendotherval coroutineC gt val  yield gt does something to val gt coroutineA.sendotherval codepre  pAnd from time to time I want to pass a new value from the outside of this loop to coroutineA, and then off it goes again.p  precodeEXTERNAL TO LOOP gt coroutineA.sendmessage gt loop continues from new value... codepre  pThe individual pieces work fine, but two issues arise when I try to connect them up. Firstly, how to instantiate these as a loop, which seems doable, but leads to a deeper issue as elaborated on beneath.p  pstrongTHE FIRST ISSUEstrongp  pWhen instantiating coroutineA,  coroutineB doesnt exist yet, so it isnt yet possible to tell coroutineA what its message target is. Basically a chicken and egg scenario.p  pIve tried creating a container function that instances each of these coroutines without message targets, and then creates a loop that manages the message on behalf of the coroutines like sop  precodedef func     A  coroutineA     nextA     B  coroutineB     nextB     C  coroutineC     nextC     messageA  A.sendNone     while True         messageB  B.sendmessageA         messageC  C.sendmessageB         messageA  A.sendmessageC codepre  pThe problem with this is that it doesnt then seem possible to pass messages in from outside the loop because the while loop just gets stuck doing its thing.p  pAnother way around this is to instantiate coroutineA with a nested yield expression so that the target can be passedin after instantiation timep  precodedef coroutineA     while True         val  yield         if val is not None             coroutineBtarget  val             while True                 val  yield                 if val is not None                     do something to val                     coroutineBtarget.sendotherval  A  coroutineA nextA  prime coroutine A.sendB  send in coroutineB target and step into inner while loop codepre  pHowever, when coroutineC tries to send a message to coroutineA I get a ValueError exception generator already executing. p  pSo both of these strategies basically lead top  pstrongTHE DEEPER ISSUEstrongp  pIt appears that generators as coroutines cant loop back on themselves, and it seems that the reason for this is that the send call is a normal method, so effectively trying to chain a callstack back on itself, i.e. doesnt allow recursion  reentry per David Beazleys a hrefhttpwww.dabeaz.comfinalgeneratorFinalGenerator.pdf relnofollowemGenerators The Final Frontierema pages 127 to 131.p  pSo its necessary to handoff the information to a queue system and then dequeue and start a new call. But when I try this, I seem to get stuck with While loops that block messages originating from outside of the loop.p  pemSo, long story short, how does one, on one hand, keep the loop cranking over on itself while, on the other hand, remaining open to new messages originating from outside the loopemp

Negative 72390 pWithin the NodeJS code, one can recognize a macro being used, to add information to a seemingly global struct, that allows the component to be available through that struct  or, possibly an array I didnt figure it out.p  pWhat I want to do is to create a similar model  where I have smaller components that are going to be statically compiled into the binary that then get all initialized in a row.p  pTraditionally, you might be doing something like thisp  precodeinclude mymodule.h namespace mymodule      int afunction ...  void initializemymoduleSomeContext ctx ... codepre  pAnd then within your main app, youd have a few of these codeinitializeXYZcode functions. But I will have about 20 and upwards of these components  and it would be a huge advantage, if all components were initialized automatically.p  pDoes anyone know of a structure or way of doing this For an almostreal example, lets consider this situation I am using the AngelScript scripting language and I want to initialize 5 components into it by iterating over entries in an arraylike structure.

Negative 72390 pI am working on a Silverlight application that implements a custom MediaStreamSource that is feeding a MediaElement with elementary H.264 NAL units. My stream starts off with a key frame, but I noticed that on average it takes about 20 frames to render one image. I have my GOP size set to 8 on my H.264 encoder. This video is coming from a security camera and is being viewed in a live stream application.p  pThe main issue is that this induces a decent amount of latency between when events happen in real life and when the image is actually rendered. A small latency is expected, but it turns out to be about 3 seconds from receiving the first frame until the first image is rendered. Shouldnt the first key frame theoretically contain enough information to decode an image For testing I have a sample Silverlight application that loads a captured H.264 stream from a file and internally buffers the entire file, this way once the MediaStreamSource opens, it immediately consumes 20 frames and renders the image with virtually no latency.p  pAny Microsoft  Silverlight  H.264 experts care to elaborate on why this might possibly be happeningp

Negative 72390 pI am looking for an algorithm and hopefully a .net implementation that can do the following I have the following datap  ol lia list of technicians each one with different skills could be more than one.li lia service time window e.g. 812li lia list of all previously scheduled jobs within this time window each with its required skillsli ol  pgiven a new job with required skills, I am supposed to check if the new job and be assigned to any of the technicians available previous jobs may be moved between technicians as long as their skills support it. also the service time window cannot be exceeded so a 1 hour job cannot scheduled for 1130p  pInitially I thought about doing bin packing FFD variant were I preload the bins technicians and when looking for a bin to place a job I would also check for skill matching. The job list would contain all previous jobs and the new one sorted descending by size and either the code stops because a job cannot be placed in any bin or it finishes after all jobs have been scheduled.p  pIn theory it could work but then I thought of the following scenariop  ul liTechnicians T1with skills S1 amp S2, T2with skills S2 amp S3li liPrevious jobs J1 requires skill S2, Duration the whole time window.li liNew Job J2 requires skill S1li ul  pA case could happen that J1 is assigned to T1 and then J2 has no place to fit. p  pSo I thought about adding a second sort to the job list Jobs will be sorted by size descending and then by the number of resources who can actually do them ascending. This would place J2 to be scheduled first as fewer technicians can do it. p  pIs there a specific algorithm for solving this or is my approach good enough p  pThanksp

Negative 72390 pstrongHello folks, Im at my wits end. Please helpstrong p  pstrongHeres the situationstrongbr We use Google Apps for Business. We have one Google Drive folder  Folder A  that contains about 30 subfolders. Each of these subfolders contains hundreds of files and folders within it. You can assume that I am the owner of all files and folders on Google Drive. I am also the Google Apps superadmin. Folder A has a very well thoughtout structure, with as many as eight levels of folders in the folder hierarchy. We need to share Folder A with 40 different computers  folder structure, files, everything. These 40 computers are display terminals, so each is used by dozens of people every day. Its crucial for us that all 40 computers have exactly the same folder structure because people have to frequently move from one display computer to another, and they have to make a presentation in which every second matters, so we cant have them spend 5 to 10 minutes each time figuring out the folder structure of the computer they are standing at. For business reasons  potential delays, we cant have people sign in using their individual Google accounts. brbr strongHeres what I didstrongp  ol licreated a new account displaydomain.com li lishared Folder A with displaydomain.com at can view permission levelli lion all 40 computers, logged in to displaydomain.coms Google Drive and synced everythingli ol  pstrongMy problem isstrong br For some reason, Google Drive allows users to move, delete, or do pretty much whatever they want to folders and files  even if they have only can view access. Yes, this doesnt affect the original shared folder  file, but is still a huge problem because p  ol lipIf any random user goes to any of the 40 computers and accidentally deletes a file or moves it, then this affects the other 39 computers as well because Google Drive syncs across all 40 computerspli lipEven if I share Folder A can view access only with 40 different new accounts display1domain.com, display2domain.com, ..., a user can still mess up the folder structure by going to  lets say  computer 17 and moving or deleting folders. So everyone who uses computer 17 from that point onwards will struggle because the folder structure has been tampered with. Yes, the original Folder A, owned by me, will still be in perfect condition, so there is no data loss. But I have no way of knowing that the folder structure for computer 17 has been messed up. So to make sure that every computer has the correct folder structure just like my original Folder A, I need to manually go to each of the 40 computers every day and check or resync to Google Drive. Thats going to be crazy pli ol  pSo ideally we need some way to make Folder A readonly, i.e., users can access the content but cant tamper with the overall folder structure or delete files. Were open to getting creative solutions and happy to do as much work as required, as long as its onetime work  Please do help Im happy to provide as much detail as you like. p  pMany many thanks for your generosity, Manitp
Negative 72390 pVery strange issue, no results that I could find from google searches.p  pI am running Windows 7 64 bit. Everything Windows related is up to date, and so are all USB drivers. My computer is a laptop from Puget Systems. My computer has three USB inputs one USB 2.0, and two USB 3.0s. 2.0 versus 3.0 doesnt really matter though, because this issue happens with all three drives.p  pHeres the issue When connected, USB devices are found, and recognized. 530 sec later, they disconnect, only to reconnect in a couple seconds. The cycle of disconnectingreconnecting continues indefinitely. I have not been successful with keeping USB devices connected for more than 30 seconds.p  pAt this point, it could be any number of things causing this issue. But this is where it gets weird. This issue ONLY happens with mobile devices, and it happens with ALL mobile devices. By mobile devices I mean phones and iPods. I have tested my Samsung Galaxy S4, an iPod Classic, an iPod touch, an iPod nano, a Droid Turbo, and an iPhone 5. This issue occurred with all of these devices. The issue did NOT occur at all with my 2TB Seagate backup harddrive, my 1TB WD harddrive, several USB pen drives, my external keyboard, or my wireless mouse USB receiver that is plugged in nearly 247 in my USB 2.0 drive. My Xbox One controller disconnected 3 times in a row once, but that only happened once so it might have been a fluke...p  pAnyways, what could be the reason for this strangely specific issue Does anyone have any answers or has anyone experienced something similarp

Negative 72390 pI have 2 sets of data stored in 2 different sheets. I need to run an analysis which prints out the strongnonduplicatestrong rows i.e. row is present in one and not the other found in the sheets and print them in a new sheet.p  pI can do the comparison fine  it is relatively simple with ranges and the codeFor Nextcode method. I currently store the nonduplicates in 2 different collections, each representing the nonduplicates in each sheet. However I am having trouble deciding how to proceed with pasting the duplicate rows on the new sheet.p  pI thought about storing the entire row into a collection but printing the row out of the collection in the new sheet seems nontrivial I would have to determine the size of the collection, set the appropriate range and then iterate through the collection and print them out. I would also like to truncate this data which would add another layer of complexity.p  pThe other method I thought was simply storing the row number and using codeRange.Select.Copycode and codePasteSpecialcode. The advantage of this is that I can truncate however much I wish, however this seems incredibly hacky to me essentially using VBA to simulate user input and I am not sure on performance hits.p  pWhich way should I proceedp
