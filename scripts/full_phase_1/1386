Positive 1386 pI have a main activity that has listview with a namepersonfriend and numberdebtp  pwhat i want to do is when you click a name it will move to another activity to show all history of number inputs that same name had, so when i update the number and enter the new activity it should show the initial number in first row of listview and the number i updated in the second row, and for that i even made a second table that always adds and doesnt update.p  pwhat happens is the second line does get added in when i update but then both lines are the same number the updated number and of course i checked the database table and it does show the numbers correctly as i entered them, but doesnt matter how many numbers i input, all lines in the ListView will show the same number which is the last number i updated for that name.p  pi am passing the values in an intent, so maybe its not the right method to do it but i dont know any other wayp  phere is the relevant code first from the main activity where i pass the datap  precodeprivate void listViewItemClick      ListView listView  ListView findViewByIdR.id.mydebtslist     listView.setOnItemClickListenernew AdapterView.OnItemClickListener          Override         public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View view, int position, long id               Intent intent  new IntentMainActivity.this, ViewFriend.class             Cursor c  Cursor parent.getItemAtPositionposition             intent.putExtraNAMEEXTRA, c.getStringc.getColumnIndexString.valueOfDBAdapter.KEYNAME             intent.putExtraDEBTEXTRA, c.getStringc.getColumnIndexString.valueOfDBAdapter.KEYDEBT             intent.putExtraDATEEXTRA, c.getStringc.getColumnIndexString.valueOfDBAdapter.KEYDATE             intent.putExtraLABELEXTRA, c.getStringc.getColumnIndexString.valueOfDBAdapter.KEYLABEL              startActivityintent                codepre  pnow the second activity with the listview that it is passed top  precodepopulate ListView public void populateViewString name     Cursor cursor  myDb.getByNamename     customAdapter  new ViewCursorAdapterViewFriend.this,cursor,0     ListView listView  ListViewfindViewByIdR.id.recentdebtlist     listView.setAdaptercustomAdapter   public class ViewCursorAdapter extends CursorAdapter       private LayoutInflater cursorInflater      public ViewCursorAdapterContext context, Cursor c, int flags          supercontext, c, flags          cursorInflater  LayoutInflater context.getSystemService                 Context.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE           Override     public void bindViewView view, final Context context, final Cursor cursor           TextView debt  TextView view.findViewByIdR.id.debtamount         TextView date  TextView view.findViewByIdR.id.dateinserted         TextView label  TextView view.findViewByIdR.id.debtlabel          String fLabel  getIntent.getStringExtraMainActivity.LABELEXTRA         String fDate  getIntent.getStringExtraMainActivity.DATEEXTRA         String fDebt   getIntent.getStringExtraMainActivity.DEBTEXTRA          debt.setTextfDebt         label.setTextfLabel         date.setTextfDate          String debtColor  debt.getText.toString          if debtColor.charAt0               debt.setTextColorColor.parseColor00A802         else              debt.setTextColorColor.parseColorFF0000                codepre  pnow the method that gets the relevant rows for that person name from the database helperp  precodepublic Cursor getByNameString name      Cursor cursor      db.rawQueryselect  from   FRIENDTABLE   where   KEYNAME    name   , null      if cursor  null          cursor.moveToFirst          return cursor  codepre

Positive 1386 pI could and still might do this research myself, but Im curious about the safety of  password fields in android apps. I became curious of this when I saw an app on the PlayStore Inputting which requires enabling of accessibility permissions. p  pDoes the android system prevent apps from accessing input when the user is focused on an edittext with its inputtype being password I assume yes but am interested in the subject, any extra info on how that works would be awesome. p

Positive 1386 pI am trying to pass the hour and minute from an EditText string into a calendar object and then put the hour and minute into a Bundle to be to set to a TimePickerFragment.

Positive 1386 pIm currently working on an OpenGL project in Android. Right now, Im trying to create a clip for items to be confined to when drawing, using the stencil buffer. My problem is that I would like to be able to create a clip shape, and then remove portions of that clipped shape later on much like in an Android Canvas calling clipPath with Region.Op.UNION and then another clipPath call with Region.Op.DIFFERENCEp  pBasically, my intention is to only draw to portions of the screen with a stencil buffer bit of value 1. Therefore, as I understand it, I should be able to draw to the stencil buffer with different glStencilOp functions that will allow me to draw with 1s in some areas, and then perhaps replace them later on with the default 0 in portions of those areas.p  pAs an example test, I tried to clip a doughnut on the screen, using something like thisp  precodegl20.glClearGL20.GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT  Clear stencil buffer. gl20.glEnableGL20.GLSTENCILTEST  Enable stencil test. gl20.glColorMaskfalse, false, false, false  Disable color drawing. gl20.glStencilMask0xFF  Set 0xFF as stencil mask.   Have stencil test always fail, replace drawn stencil bits with 1. gl20.glStencilFuncGL20.GLNEVER, 1, 0xFF  gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLREPLACE, GL20.GLKEEP,GL20.GLKEEP   Draw outer circle    Now, replace drawn stencil bits with 0. gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLZERO, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP   Draw inner circle.    Reenable color drawing.  gl20.glColorMasktrue, true, true, true  Now, items drawn will be confined to areas with 1 stencil bit. gl20.glStencilFuncGL20.GLEQUAL, 1, 0xFF gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP gl20.glStencilMask0x00   Draw a filled, colored rectangle to the entire screen.  codepre  pNow, as I understand it, this should result in a colored doughnut drawn to the screen However, as the code is written above, nothing is drawn to the screen.p  pHowever, if I only clip the outer circle and not try to get rid of the inner circle with the gl20.glStencilOpGL20.GLZERO, GL20.GLKEEP, GL20.GLKEEP call and subsequent inner circle drawing, a circle the size of the intended outer circle draws on the screen. p  pIve looked through the documentation that I could find, and everything that Ive read so far indicates that this should work. Is there something that Im missing here Any help is greatly appreciated.p  pAlso, if this helps at all I am using the ShapeRenderer from the LibGDX open source project to draw shapes. p

Positive 1386 pIm new to the whole android app process and Im trying to get my head around a few things. I am creating a recipe app in which recipes will be retrieved from a MySQL database. Users can search with a keyword and matching recipes are fetched and displayed in a ListView.p  pI will be using PHP, JSON, XML, etc... for the Webservices as suggested by many people and the database will be stored on my PC during development. Id p  pThe thing Im trying to understand is that as its a MySQL database running on my computer, would connections to the database only be accessible from my PC Meaning that if I wanted to develop at university, Id have to physically bring my PC with mep  pSo eventually when I export the app as an apk and send it to a few of my friends and family members for them to use, would the app still be able to communicate to the database located on my computer or would my database somehow have to be stored within the app itself p  pHow would the end user using the app be able to communicate to my PCs database if its using a localhost connection Thats what I am trying to understand.p  pIf theres any information out there that is useful that will help me understand, please share it with me.p

Negative 1386 pApologies if any of what Im about to say makes no sense or overlooks something obvious  my knowledge of CLR internals is spotty.p  pIf I understand correctly, then if I just build a solution for AnyCPU in VS2K5 or point MSBuild at that .sln file with those settings then the binaries only compile as far as MSIL. They then get JITted to 32bit if executed on a 32bit platform or 64bit code if executed on x64...rightp  pThe DLLs are used for a web app and hosted in the W3WP.exe process. Process Explorer tells me W3WP is a 64bit process.p  pBut when I use Process Explorer to check the properties on one of these DLLs in DLL view, it says Image 32bit. What givesp  pIf I run corflags against the dll in question it tells me ILONLY 1 , 32BIT 0 but PE PE32 . My understanding is that this means yes it is compiled only as far as IL, no its not limited to either 32 bit or 64 bit, but Im not entirely clear. Is the PE32 flag anything to do with it showing up as 32bit as per abovep

Negative 1386 pi have a small problem with a program that im writing. I have a table  stocks which contains informationproducts, barcodes etc. about items stored in a fridge. I then have another table  shop which acts like a shop,containing loads of products and their barcodes.some of the products in the shop table are in the stock table at the moment, and there is a boolenan field called stock which tells us if that product is in the stock table or not, if its equal to 1, it is in the fridge, if it is equal to 0, it is not in the fridge. Two fields in the stocks table are amount and quantity. The amount is what is in the fridge at the moment, the quantity is what has to be in the fridge at all times. When something is taken out of the fridge, that products amount amount drops by 1.  Each barcode in the stocks table has a matching one in the shop table. I need to make a query to the database from a python program which will order products from the shops table when the amountwhats in the fridge is less than the quantitywhats meant to be in the fridge at all times. So you need to take the barcode of a row in the stocks table where the amount is less than the quantity and match that up to the barcode in the shops table.

Negative 1386 pI have an application that needs to do a lot of impersonation, due to moving and creating many files across protected network shares.  Ive created a simple static class that has a method takes a user, domain, password and a delegate that contains code you need run under the impersonation context.p  pThe problem Ive been running into is when the CLR tries to bind to a referenced assembly under this context.  A FileLoadException is thrown with an Access is denied message.p  pIm led to believe that this is due to the impersonated user not having sufficient privileges to the .DLL file under the filesystem.  For example, I can write benign code just before the impersonation block, which accomplishes nothing other than to load types from the problem assembly before the context switches to the impersonated user, and this works great  However I dont really consider this to be an elegant solution  am I going to need to begin worrying about what types I can use under impersonation, making sure I put random codetypeofcode statements beforehandp  pWhat makes this more frustrating is that I dont run into this problem on my local development machine.  Its when the assemblies get shipped off to the beta environment does this problem occur.  And I dont have access to read the file permissions from the beta environment to try and mimic them on my location machine.p  pIn any case, I tried this solutionp  precode Defined above  System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity identity  System.Security.Principal.WindowsImpersonationContext context  context  identity.Impersonate  int tries  0 while  true       try              contextAction          catch  FileLoadException ex               if  tries gt MAXTRIES                        dont allow an infinite loop             throw                  if  String.IsNullOrEmpty ex.FileName                         if this is nullempty, we cant really recover             throw                  context.Undo  return to current logon         try                      var assemblyName  new AssemblyName ex.FileName              Assembly.Load assemblyName              tries             continue                  finally                      context  identity.Impersonate  reimpersonate                      finally               return to your current windows logon         context.Undo       codepre  pNo dice.

Negative 1386 pThis might be a dumb question to some of you and maybe I asked this question wrong, because I am new to c. But I notice when working in a lot of win32 applications, you use a lot of resources that are pointers. Why do you have to always acquire a objects pointer  why not initiate a new instance of the class. and speaking of that, I notice in most cases you never initiate new objects, but always call on methods that return that pointer. What if that pointer is being used somewhere else. couldnt you mess something up if you alter that pointer and it is being used somewhere else. p

Negative 1386 pI have an application with three layers Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access.  In the data access layer, I have an object called codeUnitcode, and I have another object called codeUnitcode in the business layer.p  pWhen codeInsertcode is called on the codeUnitcode object in the business layer, it calls the codeInsertcode method on the corresponding object in the data access layer, and passes itself as the parameter.  The problem I have is that the data access layer does not reference the business layer, and allowing it to do so would cause circular dependencies.p  pIs my approach flawed  If so, what would be a good solution to my problemp

Negative 1386 pIm working on a project in which I use Depency Injection. When registering a set of interfaces and classes, I need to point out the namespaces at which those interfaces and classes are located.p  pI dont like providing string constants though, mainly because it hurts refactorability.

Negative 1386 pSo Im trying to understand how SQL Server makes use of indexes on tables behind views.  Heres the scenario  Table A has a composite clustered index on fields 1 amp 2 and a nonclustered index on fields 3 amp 4.  p  pView A is written against Table A to filter out additional fields, but fields 14 are part of the view.  So we write a query that joins the view to another table on the nonclustered index fields.  p  pThe resulting query plan hits Table A with a clustered index scan instead of the expected nonclustered index seek.  However, if we replace the view in the FROM clause with the table, the query plan then hits the nonclustered index and we get the index seek we expected.p  pShouldnt the SQL engine make use of the index on the table the view is constructed on  Since it doesnt, why notp

Negative 1386 phere is the situation i have one machine which lives at my house lets call it housemachine and i have another machine at my office call this one officemachine. im using ssh with dsa key authentication and without password authentication to access homemachine from officemachine. i have set up an ssh server on homemachine and added the public key generated on officemachine to the authorizedkeys file on homemachine. this works fine  i can ssh in to homemachine from officemachine just using the key and no password.p  pnow the question i would like to be able to access homemachine when i visit other offices simply by using the public key belonging to officemachine. ie i would like to put the public key iddsa.pub on a usb drive and just copy it to the .ssh directory at another office. from what i have read on this site, others seem to have been able to do this type of thing, however it isnt working. when i try simply placing iddsa.pub on a new machine and doing codessh v userhomemachinecode the debug message ends withp  predebug1 Offering public key .sshiddsa debug1 Server accepts key pkalg sshdss blen 433 debug1 read PEM private key done type DSA debug1 Authentications that can continue publickey debug1 No more authentication methods to try. Permission denied publickey.pre  pmy temporary solution has been to set PasswordAuthentication yes in sshdconfig on homemachine, and just use a password to get to homemachine. however this voids the point of using keyauthorisation.p  pthanks in advancep

Negative 1386 pI wanted to scramble a String, to make it unreadable and so came up with this methodp  precodepublic String scrambleWordString startword       char[] wordarray  startword.toCharArray          char[] dummywordarray  startword.toCharArray          Random random  new Random          int r  random.nextIntwordarray.length1         int i  0          int j  r1          whilei lt r              dummywordarray[wordarray.length i1]  wordarray[i]              i                    while j lt wordarray.length 1              dummywordarray[jr1]  wordarray[j]              j                    String newword  String.valueOfdummywa            return newword codepre  pSO I first converted the string to a char array, and in my method I had to duplicate the char array dummywordarray. Passing once through this algorithm every lette rof the word will have changed position. But it wont be scrambled very well, in the sense that you could put it back together at a glance. SO I passed a given String of less than 9 characters through the method 7 times, and the words are fairly well scrambled, i.e. unreadable. But I tried it with a 30 character string and it took 500 passes before I could guarantee it was nicely scrambled. 500  Im sure there is a better algorithm, Id like some advice on either aimproving this method or ba better way.p

Negative 1386 pOkay, so I have a DropDownList control that contains 50 ListItems, one for each of the 50 states. The text value reflects each state name which makes each text value unique. However, the value property of each list item contains that states current tax rate, which means that some of the values are not unique. Postbacks on this control constantly change the selected item. Is there a work around for thisp  pTo duplicate, copy the code below into a new web form. It is just a simple DropDownList. Try selecting different states. Some of them stick, and others do not. For instance, try selecting Idaho as the state it reverts to Arkansas for some reason. This is happening before the OnSelectedIndexChanged event even fires because if I select Idaho and then read the selected item in the event method on postback, the selected item is Arkansas Very annoying.p  precode            Stateltbr gt             ltaspDropDownList BorderWidth3px AutoPostBacktrue BackColorffffcc IDddlBillingState                 runatservergt                 ltaspListItem Value0 TextNot SpecifiedgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4 TextAlabamagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value0 TextAlaskagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5.6 TextArizonagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextArkansasgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value8.25 TextCaliforniagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value2.9 TextColoradogtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextConnecticutgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextDistrict of ColumbiagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value0 TextDelawaregtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextFloridagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4 TextGeorgiagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4 TextHawaiigtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextIdahogtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6.25 TextIllinoisgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value7 TextIndianagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextIowagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5.3 TextKansasgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextKentuckygtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4 TextLouisianagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5 TextMainegtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextMarylandgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6.25 TextMassachusettsgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextMichigangtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6.875 TextMinnesotagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value7 TextMississippigtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4.225 TextMissourigtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value0 TextMontanagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5.5 TextNebraskagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6.85 TextNevadagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value0 TextNew HampshiregtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value7 TextNew JerseygtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5 TextNew MexicogtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4 TextNew YorkgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5.75 TextNorth CarolinagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5 TextNorth DakotagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5.5 TextOhiogtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4.5 TextOklahomagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value0 TextOregongtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextPennsylvaniagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value7 TextRhode IslandgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextSouth CarolinagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4 TextSouth DakotagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value7 TextTennesseegtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6.25 TextTexasgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4.7 TextUtahgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextVermontgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5.0 TextVirginiagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6.5 TextWashingtongtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value6 TextWest VirginiagtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value5 TextWisconsingtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspListItem Value4 TextWyominggtltaspListItemgt             ltaspDropDownListgt codepre  pI even tried disabling viewstate, then OnSelectedIndexChanged I would store the selected index in ViewState[selectedIndex] and retrieve it on postback and repopulate the drop down list.

Negative 1386 pIs there any way, with the Eclipse IDE, to have a master folder containing several related projectsp  pThe reason I want this is because I have several Maven webapps.

Negative 1386 pI have created a manifest file for a VB6 application that is running on Windows 7 not for any visual style changes, just to make sure it accesses the common registry and not a virtualised onep  pThe exe name is Capadm40.exe, the manifest is named Capadm40.exe.manifest and contains the followingp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standaloneyesgt ltassembly xmlnsurnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v1 manifestVersion1.0gt   ltassemblyIdentity version1.0.0.0      processorArchitectureX86      nameCompanyName.Capadm40      typewin32gt   ltdescriptiongtAdministers the Systemltdescriptiongt   lt Identify the application security requirements. gt   lttrustInfo xmlnsurnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v3gt     ltsecuritygt       ltrequestedPrivilegesgt         ltrequestedExecutionLevel           levelasInvoker           uiAccessfalsegt         ltrequestedPrivilegesgt        ltsecuritygt   lttrustInfogt ltassemblygt codepre  pHowever, this doesnt seem to make any difference. ie the application is still using the virtualised registry hive. What is also strange is the after I unticked the Run this program as an administrator option in the properties of the application exe, windows still shows a shield on the application icon, leading my to think this is some issue with my windows installation rather than a fault with the manifest. Any ideasp

Negative 1386 pI want to obtain an index that refers to the positions of NA values in a matrix where the index is true if a given cell is NA and there is at least one nonNA value before and after it in the column.

This way I would not select leading and trailing NA values. But this seems a bit messy, so Im wondering if there is a cleaner expression that does this without loops.p  pstrongEDITstrong To be valid an NA value only needs to have a nonNA value before and after it somewhere within the column, but not necessarily adjacent to it. For instance, if a column was defined by cNA, 3, NA, NA, NA, 4, NA, the NAs I want to find would be the ones at positions 3, 4, and 5, as these are enclosed by nonNA values.p

I do this because I cannot control when exactly the callback is called, and I know of no way to get the JNI environment or the object emliveem with no Java references whatsoever. So I save back that information at the time of object creation, where I do have the references.p  pInside of the C codeseekcode method, Im trying to invoke the Java codeseekcode method this wayp  precodevirtual void OnSeekfloat timeOffset      JNIEnv env     jvmgtAttachCurrentThreadvoidampenv, NULL     envgtCallVoidMethodbinding, mseek, jfloattimeOffset  codepre  pWhere codebindingcode is the codejobjectcode, codejvmcode the Java VM pointer and codemseekcode the codejmethodIDcode of the codeseekcode method I obtained before.p  pHowever, that invocation of codeCallVoidMethodcode will result in an access violation in codejvm.dllcode.

Negative 1386 pIm looking for a Ruby CMS or plugin that can strongserve and edit content located in a Git repositorystrong. Im sick of having my content in a db. Users, settings, comments, fine. But no more content.p  pEach live edit to a page will need to be automatically, immediately committed to prevent the need for serverside merging. Also, whenever new changes are pushed, they will need to be immediately updated on the filesystem.p  pRefinery CMS documentation seems to do something similar, although perhaps with a remote repository.p  pIve read about GitModel and gitblog, but Im still looking for something that matches my needs a bit closer. [EDIT GitModel is too hard to edit by hand when used with most CMSes, and gitblog uses static file generation.]p  pstrongEDIT My bias against databases for content only applies to sites that need a high degree of customization, and cant use any CMS asis.  Sites whose code evolves as much as its content. This is when the having content in a DB is an utter nightmare. When you need to fork the content and code at the same time, them merge them both into production later. DBs dont branch and merge.strongp  pI have such a site. p  pThe performance argument in favor of DBonly content is null and void. I wrote a CMS 5 years ago that synchronizes the database from the filesystem, where the filesystem is always the master copy. It scaled easily to 100,000 pages, maintaining 10ms response times and 2s reindex times. Fully searchable indexes of all the content, metadata, tags, dates, etc. And heck, I wrote it in the slowest, most painful framework on the planet, ASP.NET.  It actually emalmostem made ASP.NET bearable, and it has served various companies extremely well, since they had the same kind of site as mentioned above. p  pstrongSmall sites can simply use an inmemory cache, skipping the db content altogetherstrongp  pA valid argument for dbonly content is scalability of editing. Editors must all use the same server, although changes can be replicated outward. But in the case of quickchanging, highly customized sites who change code as often as content, distributedcommunity editing of said code and content is unlikely.  Communitydistributed editing can use a different system.p  pstrongSo far, the closest I have come is using Cloud9 to edit a git repository of content Nesta CMS, then push the changes via the command line. Its slow, but at least its webbased in case my dev machine isnt handy which I discover I misspelled my name in an article.strong Still looking for better options.p

Negative 1386 pAssume I have a RESTful web service, which holds information about an object that can be accessed at an url like a hrefhttpexample.commyobject relnofollowhttpexample.commyobjecta. I would like to be able to retrieve this information in two formats firstly, the XMLformatted plain data, and secondly, as a full HTML page, which may also include a javascript interface to change the object and PUT it back with AJAX.p  pWhat is the canonical way to achieve this Should I publish my object at two different urls like a hrefhttpexample.commyobjectformatxml relnofollowhttpexample.commyobjectformatxmla and ...formathtml Are there better ways than using a query string to distinguish the URLS here Or is it sensible to send something like multipart MIME data and can I rely on browsers being able to extract the HTML part Or is there some HTTP header field in the request I could usep  pWith PUT or POST requests sent in different formats, it is much easier as the server can check the format and parse it accordingly.p

What am i doing now, is that, for example, in codepackage1.module1code i write codefrom package1 import module2code, i.e. using full path to imported module. I do this because if i use codeimport module2code  this will not work when the module will be imported from another package codepackage2code. I also cannot use codefrom . import module2code  this will not work when running codemodule1code directly.p  pOK, so for codefrom package1 import module2code in codepackage1.module1code to work in both cases when running directly codepackage1.module1code and when importing it from codepackage2code i add these lines at the beginning of codepackage1.module1codep  precodeimport os, sys currDir  os.path.dirnameos.path.realpathfile rootDir  os.path.abspathos.path.joincurrDir, .. if rootDir not in sys.path  add parent dir to paths     sys.path.appendrootDir codepre  pFor me this works, but i feel this is not pythonic.

Negative 1386 pIm trying to fix a particular laboratory web application written in ASP.NET.  There is a page used for quick data entry, where the enduser uses a bar code scanner to input the data.  Each time they scan a bar code on a sample or test tube, it enters the actual data based on that bar code into a text field and tells the browser to tab to the next field.  There are two bar codes they are scanning, and two text fields receiving data input.  Many in fact all of the other fields may be already defaulted for a particular tray of samples, since that data doesnt need to change.  This data entry is all about speed.  Ive fixed the form so that the tabbing onblur event uses an AJAX call to a WCF service.  Thats very quick.  The problem is when they submit the form to save the test based on the sample specimen.  The form uses a full page postback.  My goal is to eventually redesign the backend architecture to eliminate the full page postback when saving the data and to use a WCF AJAX call for that as well.  But for now, Im just trying to figure out why the page is so slow.  It is in fact the postback that causes the slowness.  There are a few SQL queries slowing things down, Im thinking the slowness is due to a dropdown containing 11,000 collection sites in it.  The list loads each time the page loads.  Is there a way I can speed up the page load time with that much data in this dropdown  Do I need to change that dropdown to being some type of autocomplete control with the top 510 matches similar to how Google searches work or is there a way to improve performance by keeping the dropdown there, but reducing the page load time  Its currently taking about 3 seconds to load the page.  Does anyone know how to speed up the page load timep  pp  h19162011 updateh1  pMade a few changes.  These are times based on when we submit the form without validation errors.

Negative 1386 pI am learning how I can install Mercurial on our team system, but I am not experienced enough to make some decision.p  pFor our team, we have a server machine used as a repository. Every team member also has herhis own Linux RedHat installed machine. However, we do not do anything on our local terminals and we do everything on the server. Every member has a user directory on the server such as homeCassie, homejohn, ... and we save all our code and work there. When we turn on the local terminals, the GNOME system shows our personal files on the server not the local machine. Whenever everyone click the terminal application on desktop, it connects to her own home directory. Thus, we do not need to use SSH command to connect to the server. It is like the school multiusers system. Everyone has a user account and she logs into her own account to do her own work. I hope I can install a shared repository on that server and every one can do push, pull, etc. all kind of commands there.p  p1 Since we use a shared environment, does it mean that I need to install Mercurial on only the server and that is enough for everyone to do commit, push, pull, etc. commandsp  p2 By installing only systemwide Mercurial, does it eliminate the ability to do local commit If I would like to let everyone still have the local commit ability, how should I do itp  p3 I have searched online. Some people mentioned that for a shared network server, it is impossible to have locks for any two users if they are trying to access the same file at the same time. Does it imply my situationp  pIn sum, we do all the work on the server. I hope to find a plan to have Mercurial control on a repository shared by everyone when everyone still has local commit ability and the repository still has some locks protection if any two users try to access a file at the same time. If this scenario is feasible, can I just install the Mercurial on the server or I need to install Mercurial for both servers and users machines If it is impossible for the scenario, would someone please suggest me a plan to have version control for our systemp

Negative 1386 pOk, so I am reading about synchronization, and I read through various algorithms such as spinlocks, semaphores, and mutex to avoid race condition.p  pHowever, these algorithms cant prevent race condition in SMP when multiple proceses access the data exactly at the same time.p  pFor example, suppose thread 1 in processor A runs     lockmutex1     withdraw1000     unlockmutex1p  pand thread 2 in processor B runs     lockmutex1     deposit1000     deposit1000     unlockmutex1p  pWhen both threads run EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME, both threads will be in critical section simultaneously.p  pThe only solution should be in hardware level would be making each processors run slightly off to each other, but it defeats the purpose of parallelism.p  pIs there any hardware level support to avoid these situation where multiple processors try to acquire the lock at the exactly same timep  pthis is not a problem of atomicity, but rather problem of exact parallelism, and I wonder how SMP deals with it.p

Negative 1386 pIm trying to use emacs codecustomizegroupcode packages to tweak some parts of my setup, and Im stymied. I see things like this in my .emacs file after I make changes with customizep  pre classlangel prettyprintoverridecodetrampbackupdirectoryalist quote . . .emacs.dautobackups codepre  pThis was the result of putting the following into the customize text field p  precodeRegexp matching filename . codepre  pThis is a representative sample Im actually trying to change several things that want a regexp, and they all show this same problem. How many layers of quoting are there, really I cant seem to find the magic number of backslashes to get the goshdang thing to do what Im asking it to, even for the simplest regular expressions like code.code. Right now, the given customization produces  nothing. It makes no change from emacs default behavior. p  pBetter yet, where on earth is this documented Its a little difficult to Google for, but Ive been trying quite a few things there as well as in the official documentation and the Emacs wiki. Where is an authoritative source for how many dang backslashes one needs to make a regular expression in customizemode actually work  or at the very least, to fail with some kind of warning instead of failing silentlyp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong As so often happens with questions asked in anger, I was asking the wrong question. Fortunately the answers below, led me to the answer to the question that I needed, which was about quoting rules. Im going to try to write down what I learned here, because I find the documentation and Googleable resources to be maddeningly obscure about this. So here are the quoting rules I found by trial and error, and I hope that they help someone else, inspire correction, or both.p  pWhen an emacs customizemode buffer asks you for a Regexp matching filename, it is being, as emacs often is, both terse and idiosyncratic how often a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRichardStallman relnofollowthe creators personalitya is imparted to the creation.  It means, for one thing, a regexp that will be compared to the emwhole pathem of the file in search of a match, not just to the name of the file itself as you might assume from the term filename. This is the same sense of filename used in emacs codebufferfilenamecode function, for example. p  pFurther, although if you put codefoocode in the field, youll see codefoocode with doublequotes written to the actual file, thats not enough quoting and not the right quoting. You need to quote your regexp with the quoting style that, as far as I can tell, only emacs uses the codebacktickfoosinglequotecodescheme. And then you need to emescape that,em making it codex60backslashbacktickfoobackslashsinglequotecode and if you think thats a headache to input in Markdown, its more so in emacs. p  pOn top of this, emacs appears to have a rule that the code.code regexp special character does not match a codecode at the beginning of filenames, so, as was happening to me above, the classic code.code pattern will appear to match nothing to match all files, you actually need the regexp code.code, which then you stuff into the quote format of customizemode to produce codex60.code, after which customize paints emanotherem layer of escaping onto it and writes it to the customization file. p  pThe final result for one of my efforts  a setting such that autosave files dont gunk up the directory youre working in, but instead all live in one placep  pre classlangel prettyprintoverridecodecustomset variables   autosavefilenametransforms quote      [][][] .emacs.dautobackups2 t     .. .emacs.dautobackups1 t  codepre  pBackslashes in elisp are a far greater threat to your sanity than parentheses. p  hr  pstrongEDIT 2strong Time for me to be wrong again. I finally found the relevant documentation through reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7572411beginningandendofthestringinemacsregexpsanother Stack Overflow questiona, of course a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsemacsmanualhtmlnodeelispRegexpBackslash.htmlRegexpBackslash relnofollowRegexp Backslash Constructsa. The crucial point of confusion for me the backtick and single quote are emnotem quoting in this context theyre the equivalent of perls codecode and codecode special characters. The backslashbacktick construct matches an empty string anchored at the beginning of the string being checked for a match, and the backslashsinglequote construct matches the empty string at the end of the stringunderconsideration. And by string under consideration, I mean buffer, which just happens to contain only a file path in this case, but you need to match the whole dang thing if you want a match at all, since this is elisps global regexp behavior.p  pSwear to god, its like dealing with an alien civilization. p  hr  pstrongEDIT 3strong In order to avoid confusing future readers  p  ul licodecode is the emacs regex for the beginning of the buffer. cf a hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgperlre.htmlAssertions relnofollowPerls codeAcodeali licodecode is the emacs regex for the end of the buffer. cf Perls codeZcodeli licodecode is the commonidiom regex for the beginning of the line. It can be used in emacs.li licodecode is the commonidiom regex for the end of the line. It can be used in emacs.li ul  pBecause regex searches across multiline bodies of text are more common in emacs than elsewhere e.g. codeMx occurcode, the backtick and singlequote special characters are used in emacs, and as best as I can tell, theyre used in the context of customizemode because if you are considering generic unknown input to a customizemode field, it could contain newlines, and therefore you want to use the beginningofbuffer and endofbuffer special characters because the beginning and end of the eminputem are not guaranteed to be the beginning and end of a emline.emp  pI am not sure whether to regret hijacking my own Stack Overflow question and essentially turning it into a blog post.p

Negative 1386 pIm working on a message parsergenerator subsystem. Im creating an autogenerator that uses a database that contains all of the information about this protocol, including enum lists, to generate the code. One thing I came across is the need for hierarchical enumerations. p  pstrongupdatedstrongp  pI was trying to simplify things by not describing the emfullem problem, but the comments below make it obvious that I erred by simplifying too much.p  pThe Database being used will store things as simplified strings customer decision, but the protocol only speaks byte triplets aka Hierarchical Enum. The full problem could be described as suchp  blockquote   pGiven a set of unique strings that each correspond with a unique triplet, 1 find the triplet for any given string, strongandstrong 2 find the string for any given triplet. Make sure to account for Undefined and No Statement enumerations which do not have strings associated with them. [As one poster noted, yes it emisem insane.]p blockquote  pCaveat Ive been doing C for well over a decade, but Ive been doing Java this last year  my C is probably corrupted.p  pSo, to use an admittedly contrived example, givenp  precode There is only one category  POP P, COUNTRY K, CLASSICAL C enum Category POP, COUNTRY, CLASSICAL   There is one Type enum for each Category.  ROCK R, BIGBAND  B, COUNTRYPOP C  enum PopType ROCK, BIGBAND, COUNTRYPOP enum CountryType CLASSICALCOUNTRY, MODERNCOUNTRY, BLUEGRASS, COUNTRYANDWESTERN  ...   There is one Subtype for each Type  EIGHTIES E, HEAVYMETAL H, SOFTROCK S enum RockSubType  EIGHTIES, HEAVYMETAL, SOFTROCK  ... codepre  pWhen I get 0, 0, 0 Pop, Rock, Eighties, I need to translate that to PRE. Conversely, if I see PC in the Database, that needs to be sent out the wire as 0, 2 Pop, Country, NULL.p  pIm blatantly ignoring Undefined and No Statement at this point. Generating a triplet from a string seems straight forward use an unordered map, string to triple. Generating a string from a triplet that may contain a NULL in the last entry ... not so much. Most of the enum tricks that I know wont work for instance, Types repeat values  each Type enum starts at zero  so I cant index an array based on the Enum value to grab the string.p  pWhats got me is the relationship. At first glance it appears to be a fairly straight forward isa relationship, but that doesnt work because this case is bidirectional. The leaf  root navigation is very straight forward, and would be appropriate for a class hierarchy unfortunately, going the other way is not so straight forward.p  pI cannot hand roll this  I have to generate the code  so that probably eliminates any XML based solutions. It also has to be reasonably fast. The Java Solution involves using protected static variables, initialized on construction, and abstract base classes however, I do not believe this would work in C order of initialization, etc.. Plus, aesthetically, I feel this should be ... more const. Other code Ive seen that tackles this problem uses unions, explicitly listing all of the enum types in the union.p  pThe only other thing I can come up with is using Template Specialization and explicit specialization, but Im at a loss. I did a web search on this, but I found nothing that would tell me if it would even work. Still, if it can be done with a union, cant it be done with Template Specializationp  pIs it possible to do something like this using templates, specialization, explicit specialization Is there another, more obvious, solution i.e. a design pattern that Ive forgotten that Im missingp  pOh, before I forget  the solution must be portable. More specifically, it must work on Windows Visual Studio 2010 and Redhat Enterprise 6Centos 6 GCC 4.4.4 IIRC.p  pAnd, lest I forget, this protocol is emhugeem. The theoretical max on this is about 133,000 entries once I include Undefined and No Statement Ill probably have that many entries.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1386 pI recently set up some automatic scripts to help me manage incoming orders for a Magento store by using observers and Magento events. My problem is dealing with the question when exactly an order is placed and saved in the system depending on the selected payment type.p  pFor example if someone simply choses prepayment, the order is saved immediately and the customer is automatically forwarded to a success page  so no problems so far.p  pIf a customer pays via Paypal, the whole situation is completely different. After being redirected to PayPal, logging into the account and confirming the payment, the customer is not redirected to the Magento store. He can click on a link to return there which will also forward him to the success page but surely not everybody will do that and the problem is that the observer event I use only executes code if the user lands on that page. The event I am working with is checkoutOnepageControllerSuccessAction.p  pTherefore I need to know from where Magento gets the information whether a PayPal payment was successful, has been cancelled or whatever. I looked through some of the PayPal controller files under appcodecoreMagePaypalcontrollers and the only thing that looked close to a possible solution was the function successAction in StandardController.php. However, this function also seems to be triggered only when a customer choses to return to the Magento store so it doesnt help me.p  pDoes anybody have some experience with that issuep

Negative 1386 pI have a question about using semaphores in cortex m3. Ive found a thread ARM cortex mutex using bit banding a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2857452armcortexmutexusingbitbandingARM cortex mutex using bit bandinga .  There is a short description of the problem, and the last answer would be good for my problem  but I am not sure how can I implement it in cc.p  pIve never used bitbanding on the ARM my inclination instead would be to use loadexclusivestoreconditional for all such operations. Use a loop to loadexclusive the old value, compute the new value, and use a conditional store to write it back. Loop until the conditional store succeeds which it probably will the second time, if it doesnt the first.p  pI would be very grateful if someone could post a short code how to use it.p  pThanks, Martinp

Negative 1386 pFirst up we are emnotem doing TPH table per hierarchy, that would make this a lot simpler.p  pI have about 20 POCOs that all have similar properties in some cases.  The similar properties I care about are code.CreatedDatecode and code.UpdatedDatecode.  For some of the POCOs, codeUpdatedDatecode doesnt make sense, so they dont have that property.  codeCreatedDatecode will always exist, codeUpdatedDatecode may be null.  Sometimes theres a third field as well.p  pThe query to retrieve objects from the database always looks the same, regardless of which of the 20 POCOs Im querying.  However, the query was duplicated 20 times, one for each type of the object.  I was able to break out the retrieve part to an extension method off of codeIDbSetltTgtcode to do the initial lookup and joins, leaving the date range filtering as an exercise to the consumer.  Im now wanting to consolidate 20 nearlyidentical looking date range filters into one, but running into problems with query comprehension.p  pThe date filtering logic, per POCO, is that UpdatedDate should be checked and its value compared to a threshold.  If UpdatedDate was null or the property didnt exist, then CreatedDate should be used instead.p  pltbackgroundgtp  pI started by creating a static property getter on each POCO, which I named DateFields.  Its typed as an codeIEnumerableltExpressionltFuncltT, DateTimegtgtgtcode that looks like thisp  precodeget      yield return x gt x.UpdatedDate     yield return x gt x.CreatedDate     yield return x gt x.Date  codepre  pThese fields are returned in the order I want them checked, and are unique to each POCO.p  pI then created a predicate to check each value against a high and low rangep  precodepublic static bool DatesBetweenltTgt T value, IEnumerableltExpressionltFuncltT, DateTimegtgtgt dates, DateTime dateFrom, DateTime dateTo      var firstDate  dates         .Selectexpression gt expression.Compile         .FirstOrDefaultfunc gt funcvalue  null      if firstDate  null         return false      var minDate  dateFrom.GetValueOrDefaultSqlDateTime.MinValue.Value     var maxDate  dateTo.GetValueOrDefaultSqlDateTime.MaxValue.Value      var actualDate  firstDatevalue      return minDate lt actualDate ampamp actualDate lt maxDate  codepre  pHowever, as expected, when I try and use this in my codeIQueryablecode, I get a runtime exception, because theres no translation to DatesBetween in SQL.  I was hoping that by keeping the expression tree, I could ... I dunno ... keep EF happy.  The whole thing is used like thisp  precodereturn Entities     .GetEntitiesBySomeFieldfield  magic value     .Whereentity gt RepositoryExtensions.DatesBetweenentity, MyPOCO.MyDates, dateFrom, dateTo codepre  pIs what Im asking clear, and is there a way to accomplish this kind of generic filtering without doing an AsEnumerable   which does work, but doesnt accomplish my goal of filtering on the DB.p

But after navigating around in my app, I realized that I had accidentally added the wrong version of the jquery.autoresize.js file. So, I deleted that file and then added the correct version to the vendorassetsjavascripts folder. But, to my horror, when I reloaded the page, it is still loading the old javascript file. p  pI tried emptying my browser cache, then exiting and restarting the Rails server, but to no avail. I hacked a solution together by simply renaming my javascript file and referencing the new name, which worked fine. But there has got to be a better solution to this. p  pDoes the new asset pipeline cache the files you reference somehow If so, how can I clear that cache Thanks for any helpp
Negative 1386 pI am working on a project. I am trying to implement the core as independent jar file which can be run from command line or even a windows service. The core would be responsible to keep track couple of files and send some notification emails. The question is, what would be the best idea to keep GUI totally independent p  pThe GUI needs following interation with the corep  ul lisend list of filesli lireceive notifications from core regarding how much those files has been processedli lireceive status notifications regarding files i.e. SENDProcessingFailed etc to be displayed in GUIli lireceive information if there is incoming messages from coreli ul  pI had this software developed in Delphi and C. C was used to code the core logic and using Windows Messages and Callbacks, i registered Delphi GUI on C dllservice. I am confused how to implement it in java.p  ul liObserver patternli liSmall clientserver communication between core and guili ul  pP.S The reason i am discussing it here is to learn and explore better design for such softwares when coded in Java. I aint asking for Observer Pattern documentation or client server architecture. There could be other possible means which i am not aware of. So I am looking forward to any idea, design or framework.p

Negative 1386 pI have a question about a Database technique to store dependencies. I know there are out there a lot of them, but I cannot place them easily in the scheme I need.  I have created simple imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCgyuD.jpg altSkills examplep  pAs you can see what I need is to create a tree of skills like in games which depends on each other. So for example if someone goes and want to have skill 8 I can tell him that he needs to first have skill 1,2 and 5. p  pThis might be fine for hirearchial data in database, but what I cannot quite figure out is how to do this model dynamically. The problem I have is, that skills will be added all the time in all possible places in the tree. Never ending. An skills can be added on any level. p  pNow after this first question there is one more complication. I need the skills to have levels as well. So for example skill 1 can have 10 levels. and you can achieve skill 2 only after achieving skill 1 level 5. p  pFor people who play games like World of Warcraft should be understandable.p  pOne more note, Skills can be added anytime, but cannot be changed after adding. On normal basis. Just in case some of the skill would be extremely bad or something like that, then it would be removed, but that would occur just very rarely.p  pThank you for suggestions, links or any other materialsp

Negative 1386 pI am working on a multipage assessment form where the questionsresponses are database driven.  Currently I the basic system working with Html.BeginForm via standard ASP.Net MVC.p  pAt this point in time, the key to the whole system is the Strongly Typed Partial Views.  When the questionresponse is read from the database, the response type determines which derived model is created and added to the collection.  The main view it iterates through the collection and uses the Strongly Typed Partial Views system of ASP.Net MVC to determine which view to render the correct type of response radio button, drop down, or text box.p  pI would like to change this process from a Html.BeginForm to Ajax.BeginForm.  The problem is I dont have a clue as to how to implement the dynamic creation of the questionresponse in the JavaScriptjQuery world.  Any thoughts andor suggestionsp  pExtra infop  pThe reason for the change is the complex real time skippattern validation which needs to happen.  Some questions trigger skippatterns.  The skippatterns determine the accessibility and values of other questions.  When a user changes a question that triggers a skippattern, all the current answers need to be sent back to the server to be run through the rule engine.  p  pOne issue is that when an ASP.Net MVC input is set to readonly, its value is not posted back.  The solution is a hidden input with the current value.  This hidden value needs to be managed by JavaScript in both the case the value is changed by the user or by the rule engine.  p  pAll in all, it seems very complex to manage. It seems more logical that the ASP.Net MVC code simply provide a JSON model and jQuery simply builds the forms in the browser and then calls either the save action or the skippattern validation action, passing it the JSON model.  Seems to remove one layer of headachep  pHere is the current code to generate the dynamic formp  precodeusing Html.BeginFormnew  mdsId  Model.MdsId, sectionId  Model.SectionId       ltdiv classSectionTitlegt         ltspangtSection Model.SectionName  Model.SectionDescriptionltspangt         ltspan stylefloat rightgtHtml.CheckBoxForx gt x.ShowUnansweredQuestions Show only unaswered questionsltspangt     ltdivgt      Html.HiddenForx gt x.PrevSectionId     Html.HiddenForx gt x.NextSectionId      for var i  0 i lt Model.answers.Count i              Html.EditorForm gt m.answers[i]          codepre

Negative 1386 pI have a wav file pulled up in MATLAB, and I can see its sample rate. All I need to do is change this 1 number. Everything else in the file will remain uncahnged. The resulting sound would play at a different speed but would have an identical array of sample data.p  pThe reason I need to do this is because MATLAB seems to freak out when I tell it to open something sampled at anything other than 8k. All I need MATLAB for is to edit the file, so the sample rate really doesnt matter at all, since Ill be putting it back into a wav file when Im done. So I either need to be able to change the value in the wav file that stores the sample rate, or to get MATLAB to change the sample rate it prefers from 8k to the sample rate that my files were recorded at.p

Negative 1386 pI want to be able to draw shapes circles, polygons and rectangles on a Google map but I would like to place limits on the size area of the shape that can be drawn. So taking a circle as an example, the desired behaviour would be that as the user starts dragging the mouse from a certain point on the map to form the circle , the circle would hit an invisible boundary and just stop expanding.p  pIll define the emsizeareaem of the shape as the geographical area it covers. Ideally I would like to be able to stipulate limits on the geographical area that shape covers. So in the circle example, I could specify that the circle would stop expanding when the geographical area it covers reaches, say 10 square kilometres, regardless of the viewport zoom level.p  pI havent though how this would work for drawing a polygon but Im sure its a bit more complicated because of the fact that a polygon is drawn in stages multiple clicks... but one step at a time.p

Negative 1386 pI have a large collection of pictures with GPS locations, encoded as latlon coordinates, mostly in Los Angeles. I would like to convert these to 1 zipcodes, and 2 neighborhood names. Are there any free web services or databases to do sop  pThe best I can come up with so far is scrape the neighborhood polygons from the a hrefhttpprojects.latimes.commappinglaneighborhoods relnofollowLA times pagea and try to find out in which polygon every coordinate is. However this might be quite a lot of work, and not all of my coordinates are in LA. As for the zipcodes, this 2004 a hrefhttpwww.boutell.comzipcodes relnofollowdatabasea is the best I can find, however zipcodes are encoded as a single coordinates instead of a polygon. So the best I can do is find the minimum distance from a given coordinate to the given zipcodecoordinates, which is not optimal.p  pI was under the impression that googlemaps or openstreetmaps should be able to do this as they seem to know exactly where every neighboorhood and zipcode is, however I cannot find any APIs to do the lookups  queries.p

Negative 1386 pIs it bad practice to use a default name e.g. myproductname for a Hazelcast group if using a nonmulticast member discovery methodp  pMy worries are founded on the following scenario... If you have multiple Hazelcast groups on the same network but with different members what does this mean Will they function correctly as separate groups or will there be problems such as a message being sent to a member of the wrong groupp  pFor example if you had one group named dev that contained nodes A and B discovered through TCPIP configuration i.e. the members are explicitly defined running on a laptop and someone starts a new group also named dev on a different PC on the same network and has explicitly defined members C and D  will these clustersgroups function perfectly well in isolation of each otherp  pFurthermore if the first group explicitly defined its members but the second group used multicast discovery would that change anything Would the multicast group accidentally include members from the other groupp

Negative 1386 pI am reading the book a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1430241071Pro Spring 3a. It has a certain paragraph that really confused me. The paragraph is about autowiring in spring.

Using byName seems like a good   idea, but it  may lead you to give your classes artificial property   names so that you can take advantage of the autowiring functionality.    The whole idea behind Spring is that you can create your classes how   you like and have Spring work for you, not the other way around ...p      p...

Negative 1386 pWhat kind of type inference does Typed Racket do I found the following snippet on the Racket mailing listp  blockquote   pThe Typed Racket type system contains a number of features that go   beyond whats supported in HindleyMilner style type systems, and so   we cant use that inference system.

Negative 1386 pNot sure if this has been answered already but a quick search didnt turn up a satisfying result..br Im stuck with the following scenariop  ul liweb service with REST API and JSON formatted data blobsli liandroid client app talking to this service and locally caching  processing the datali ul  pThe we service is run by a German company so some of the strings in the result data contain special characters like German umlauts p  precode example resonse [               title  reward 1,          description  Ein grou00dfer Kaffee fu00fcr dich     ,               title  reward 2,          description  Eine Pizza fu00fcr dich     ,     ... ] codepre  pLocally the app is parsing the data using a set of classes which mirror the response objects e.g. emRewardem and emRewardResponseem classes for the upper example. Each of these classes can read and dump itself from  to JSON  however this is where things get ugly.    p  pTaking the example above org.json will correctly parse the data and the resulting strings will contain proper Unicode versions of the special characters  emu00dfem and  emu00fcem.p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodefinal RewardResponse response  new RewardResponsejsonData final Reward reward  response.get0   this will print Ein groer Kaffee fr dich Log.ddump server data, reward.getDescription  final Reward reward2  new Rewardreward.toJSON   this will print Ein groer Kaffee fr dich Log.ddump reloaded data, reward2.getDescription codepre  pAs you can see there is a problem with loading the data generated by emJSONObject.toStringem.br Mainly whats happening is that emJSONObjectem will parse escapes in the form of emuXXXXem but it will dump them as plain UTF8 text.    p  pIn turn, when parsing it wont properly read the unicode and instead insert a replacement character in the result string  above emuffffem as code point.p  pMy current workaround consists of a lookup table containing the Unicode Latin1 supplement characters and their respective escaped versions emu00a0em up to emu00ffem. But this also means I have to go over each and every dumped JSON text and replace the characters with their escaped versions each time I dump something.p  pstrongPlease tell me there is a better way for thisstrongp  pNote there is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5536140androidparsingspecialcharactersaouinjsonthis questiona however he had problems with local file encoding on disk.br My problem above, as you can see, is reproducible without ever writing to diskp  pstrongEDITstrong As requested in the comments heres the emtoJSONem method p  precodepublic final String toJSON      JSONObject obj  new JSONObject       mTitle and mDescription contain the unmodified      strings received from parsing.     obj.puttitle, mTitle     obj.putdescription, mDescription      return obj.toString  codepre  pAs a side note it makes no difference if I use emJSONObject.toStringem or a emJSONStringerem.

As odd as it sounds, and as unlikely as it is to happen, the first read can return the correctly computed hash value, and the second read can return 0 This is allowed under the memory model because the model allows extensive reordering of operations. The second read can actually be moved, in your code, so that your processor does it before the firstp blockquote

It calls WrapperStdHandle nicknamed AliasGetStdHandle, which jumps to WindowsGetStdHandle, the DLL function.p  pAnd we are done, now the assembly program can be linked, without changing anything in it. All the renaming machinery is done in the pascal program calling it.p  pThe only drawback the need for a wrapper function, but its not overpriced for a fine control of names.p  hr  h1Another solutionh1  pIf kernel32.dll is not specified in declaration of WindowsGetStdHandle, but with linklib kernel32, then the symbol gets visible in object files linked in the pascal program. However, it seems the linklib directive alone is not enough, one still has to declare in pascal some function refering to itp  precodeprogram dlltest  linklib kernel32  function WindowsGetStdHandlen longint longint stdcall    external name GetStdHandle  link myget.obj  function AsmGetStdHandlen longint longint stdcall    external name gethandle  const STDOUT  11  begin    writelnAsmGetStdHandleSTDOUT    writelnWindowsGetStdHandleSTDOUT end. codepre  pWith the following assembly program.

Negative 1386 pIn a distributed computing setup, I want to send an unorderedset to many nodes. I am aware of serialization in C e.g. by using codeboostserializationcode. My beef with serialization is that Im facing the costs to rebuild the codeunorderedsetcodedata structure on every node after receiving the serialized data.p  pMy idea is to write a custom allocator for unorderedset that allocates a fixed size of contiguous memory and returns the starting memory address after allocation. Then I want to grab the byte representation of the codeunorderedsetcode, sent it over the wire, and tell the receiving node that this chunk of memory is an codeunorderedsetcode.p  pWould that work Do you guys have alternative ideas how to tackle my problem Or do you have any relevant pointers e.g. to writing such an allocator Any feedback is appreciated. p  pThank youp

How can I get or generate a list of indices of the selected vertices in a Python scriptp  pI find the Blender Python API reference utterly confusing to navigate, and Google mostly points to outdated APIs. This is hopefully trivial for the Blender scripting pros.p  pThe indices should be consistent with the vertex indices in an OBJ export of the mesh.

Negative 1386 pI want to develop a web application in which client calls a service on server to do some action which involves some processing. Server will do all the necessary processing and when the updated data is ready it will push that data to client. Currently I am considering two approaches   1. Using ASP.NET WEB API with SignalR 2. Using WebSockets with WCF in .NET 4.5.p  pMy server will be on Windows Server 2012 but majority of my client will be IE 9 which I think do not support WebSockets.p  pAs written in the SignalR documentation that it automatically falls to Long Polling if WebSockets support is not present without changing the application code. Whether this is also supported by WebSockets in .NET 4.5 or I have to do it manually. Means whether I have to implement both the Pull method and push method on the server.p  pPlease guide me, which approach I will have follow.p  pIn later use case I want to build this web application using PhoneGAP to create mobile app for iOS, Android amp Windows Phone.p

Consider using a DataContractResolver or add any types not known statically to the list of known types  for example, by using the KnownTypeAttribute attribute or by adding them to the list of known types passed to DataContractSerializer.p blockquote  pso taken from the question mentioned in the first line i proceeded to add the code[DataContract]code, code[DataMember]code and code[KnownTypetypeofT]code attributes to the classes mentioned above. where codeTcode is of course the correct type.p  pwhat happens is that we send person objects through wcf to a receiving party, which works fine if the is no link between the codepersonPropertycode and the codepersonnelClassPropertycode, but if we add a codepersonpropertycode with a link to codePersonnelClassPropertycode, we get the exception mentioned above.p  pall the examples and questions i see online work the same wayp  pso concretely what am i doing wrong or what am i forgetting herep  pill try to update the question with more code to illustrate the objects we use.p  pstrongeditstrong I updated the structure of the codePersoncode object to show what i have done with the codeKnownTypescode. note that this also holds the codepersonnelClassPropertycode type, i have also did this for the codePersonPropertycode object, because that is the actual class that holds the codePersonnelClassPropertycode object, but a list of codepersonPropertiescode is used in codePersoncode. this doesnt work either.p

Negative 1386 pI need to run some business logic once and only once in a GeronimoTomcat cluster when a WAR or EAR deploys and before the applications starts serving to users.  p  pThe way Ive been doing this has been todate has been adhoc and is not fault tolerant.  I use a configuration file on node 1 and designate it the startup node.  When the application starts up in the cluster, every node writes its ip address to a database and then sleepwaits in a Servlet.init that was set to loadonstartup in web.xml.  When the startup node sees that all expected nodes have written their IP to the database, it runs the business logic.  When the startup business logic completes, it sends the allclear to the other nodes by writing a confirmation row to the database.  p  pAll of the nonstartup nodes periodically twice a second poll the database for this allclear signal, and when they see it, they finish their startup and return from Servlet.init.  At this point all of the nodes serve the application normally to users.p  pI havent had my startup logic fail yet, but I was wondering if there was some Java EE standard or robust 3rd party library approach to running my startup logic only once across my cluster.  Thanksp  pstrongEdit 20130721strong  I recalled that WebLogic Server had sophisticated startup facilities that might be useful in achieving the init only once in the cluster logic that I want to do in my GeronimoTomcat cluster.

Negative 1386 pmy problem is as followsp  pIm trying to add functionality to an HTML editor which is implemented in Java Swing using HTMLEditorKit and HTMLDocument classes. The idea is to provide a possibility to switch between different styles during editing of the text in the HTML editor. The different styles define backgroundforeground colors, fonts and the like.p  pI already managed to load a stylesheet file programmatically. The code for that looks as followsp  precodeclass HtmlEditor extends JFrame implements Keylistener, MouseListener   private HTMLDocument  mdoc  private HTMLEditorKit mkit  [...]   public HtmlEditor...       [...]     final URL formats  HtmlEditor.class.getResourceformats.css predefStyles  new StyleSheet predefStyles.importStyleSheetformats mkit.getStyleSheet.addStyleSheetpredefStyles      [...]  codepre  pThe style sheet file looks as followsp  precode.style1  backgroundcolorsilver  .style2  backgroundcoloraqua  .style3  backgroundcolorteal  codepre  pWith that style sheet added to the HTMLEditorKit instances StyleSheet I can already use the styles when inserting content into the HTML editor using its source editor in the source editor one can insert HTML code directly, e.g. ltspan classstyle1gtStyled textltspangt. To allow for use of the styles in the WYSIWYG part too I added a JComboBox into the Editors toolbar which displays the names of the styles from the formats.css the leading . from the style names is removed. In the JComboBoxs ActionListener Im now trying to set the class attribute. My code looks as followsp  precode    cbStyles  new JComboBoxltStringgtgetStyleNames     cbStyles.setToolTipTextSelect Style     cbStyles.setMaximumSizenull     cbStyles.addActionListenernew ActionListener           Override         public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              currStyle  cbStyles.getSelectedItem.toString              final SimpleAttributeSet attr  new SimpleAttributeSet             attr.addAttributeHTML.Attribute.CLASS, currStyle             mkit.getInputAttributes.addAttributesattr             meditor.requestFocusInWindow                   mtoolBar.addcbStyles codepre  pUnfortunately this does not seem to function. At least, after changing the style I do not get it applied to the text Im entering afterwards and in the source view the class attribute does not appear in the containing HTML component. I inspected the code in the HtmlEditor class that manages setting another font to see if I can use the same technique that is used for chaning the font for my purpose too. The respective action listener attached to the JComboBox that provides font selection looks as followsp  precode        cbFonts.addActionListenernew ActionListener          Override         public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              mfontName  mcbFonts.getSelectedItem.toString             final MutableAttributeSet attr  new SimpleAttributeSet             StyleConstants.setFontFamilyattr, mfontName             mkit.getInputAttributes.addAttributesattr             meditor.requestFocusInWindow               codepre  pAs we can see here the class StyleConstants is used to set the attribute to the new font. Whats puzzling me is that the StyleConstants class does not seem to provide a method for setting a class attribute. As can be seen in its Javadoc there are numerous methods for setting attributes like alignment, font family, boldness, etc. Possibly my approach is incorrect in a quite simple way. Maybe I did not yet properly understand the concepts of using CSS in an HTMLDocument. Any help would be appreciatedp  pFrom my understanding in HTML CSS can be used as followsp  pA ltstyle element inside the lthead part defines style classes. Examplep  precodeltstyle typetextcssgt .style1  backgroundcolorsilver  .style2  backgroundcoloraqua  .style3  backgroundcolorteal  ltstylegt codepre  pThen inside the HTML  these classes can be referenced through the universal attribute class inside of HTML elements. Examplep  pltspan classstyle1Text in style1ltspanp  pSo it should be possible somehow to insert the class attribute with a predefined style as its value into an element in an HTMLDocument that is managed by an HTMLEditorKit. My little HTML editor is to provide functionality to activate a style at a current caret position inside the document.  So lets assume the caret position is inside a paragraph like thisp  pltpSome text without style ltpp  pafter the word style before the closing paragraph tag.p  pNow I want to activate, lets say, style1. This should then result in a structure like the followingp  pltpSome text without styleltspan classstyle1 ltspanltpp  pAnd the caret position now should be inside the new ltspan element.p  pOr if caret were at the beginning of an empty paragraphp  pltpltpp  pafter applying a style the structure should look as followsp  pltp classstyle1 ltpp  pI assume that this should be no big deal but have no clue how to get this done.p  pIn between I tried another way to solve my problem but with no success.

Negative 1386 pIm trying to implement fully valid persistence ignorance with little effort. I have many questions thoughp  pstrongThe simplest optionstrongp  pIts really straightforward  is it okay to have Entities annotated with Spring Data annotations just like in SOA but make them really do the logic What are the consequences other than having to use persistance annotation in the Entities, which doesnt really follow PI principle I mean is it really the case with Spring Data  it provides nice repositories which do what repositories in DDD should do. The problem is with Entities themself then...p  pstrongThe harder optionstrongp  pIn order to make an Entity unaware of where the data it operates on came from it is natural to inject that data as an interface through constructor. Another advantage is that we always could perform lazy loading  which we have by default in Neo4j graph database for instance. The drawback is that Aggregates which compose of Entities will be totally aware of all data even if they dont use them  possibly it could led to debugging difficulties as data is totally exposed DAOs would be hierarchical just like Aggregates. This would also force us to use some adapters for the repositories as they doesnt store real Entities anymore... And any translation is ugly... Another thing is that we cannot instantiate an Entity without such DAO  though there could be inmemory implementations in domain... again, more layers. Some say that injecting DAOs does break PI too.p  pstrongThe hardest optionstrongp  pThe Entity could be wrapped around a lazyloader which decides where data should come from. It could be both inmemory and indatabase, and it could handle any operations which need transactions and so on. Complex layer though, but might be generic to some extent perhaps...

Negative 1386 pI tried to test my app in iOS 7, and then I find my view appears over the status bar... As I read, in iOS 7, the status bar is hidden. So how do I make it compatible to run both in iOS 6 and iOS 7 Should I have to make different .xib files for different iOS versions for each screenp  pI have been going through reading this If both versions of a standard app should have a similar layout, use Auto Layout to create a UI that works correctly in both versions of iOS. To support multiple versions of iOS, specify a single set of constraints that Auto Layout can use to adjust the views and controls in the storyboard or XIB files to learn more about constraints, see Constraints Express Relationships Between Views.p  pIf both versions of a standard app should have a similar layout, and youre not using Auto Layout, use offsets. To use offsets, first update the UI for iOS 7. Next, specify values that define the origin, height, and width of each element in the earlier UI as offsets from the elements new position in the iOS 7 UI.p  pBut when I use autolayout in .xib, it shows an error that autolayout is in a prior version to iOS 6.p  pHow do I fix this problemp

Negative 1386 pIve been adopting RabbitMQ in a new project. Ill need a clustered environment to support system failure and highdemand. On to the problem queues must be created as exclusive whenever a client connects. If the client disconnects, I want the queue to be deleted, freeing its resources. Furthermore, queue binding to topics must be limited with percredential permissions. p  pConcluding, I would like to constraint connection to create only exclusive queues that would autodelete when the connection closes and only bind such queue to a list of topics I would allow, configured per user account. p  pIm not being able to either limit queue creation to exclusive, nor limit the topics a client can subscribe to. I could impose this constraint based on VHOSTS, but that would require the dynamic creation of VHOSTS and probably hundreds of them. p  pIs this possible in RabbitMQ Is there a better approach to it Thanksp

The game worked totally fine before I made my JFrame fullscreen, but now the problem is it cannot receive focus, even though everything in it is still running enemy still chases player across screen, but player cant respond.p  pI added a focuslistener to the parent class, MyPanel, but it never lost or gained focus, until I used straight up mainPanel.requestFocus, but the output told me that it gained focus then immediately lost it. I even tried setFocusablefalse on the JFrame. p  pWhen I used setVisibletrue on JFrame, then revalidate, the output changed, and I was told the mainPanel.requestFocusInWindow changed to true. The output then told me that mainPanel gained focus, lost focus, and then gained focus again. The whole time, however, my mac just responded by beeping every time I pressed a key. Sometimes, requestFocusInWindow returned false, but it still said mainPanel gained, lost, then ultimately gained the focus.p  pIn the second part of the documentation on requestFocusInWindow, it says thisp  pThis method returns a boolean value. If false is returned, the request is guaranteed to fail. strongIf true is returned, the request will succeed unless it is vetoed, or an extraordinary event, such as disposal of the Components peer, occurs before the request can be granted by the native windowing system.strong Again, while a return value of true indicates that the request is likely to succeed, developers must never assume that this Component is the focus owner until this Component receives a FOCUSGAINED event.p  pThat part is way over my head, so even if you cant solve this, if you know what that means, that might put me on the right track.p  pI will be posting updates on this if I find a solution.p

Negative 1386 pI have a class, codeDevicePointercode, that encapsulates a codestdsharedptrltDevicegtcode.  Various classes that need to hold a pointer to a Device derive from codeDevicePointercode.  Before I started using codesharedptrcode, codeDevicePointercode had an codeExposecode function that would return a raw pointer to a Device.  Now Im using sharedptr to hold the Device pointer, Im not sure how to return it.  Note that the only reason codeExposecode should be called is to dereference the pointer.p  pThis is what the original Expose looked likep  blockquote precodeDevice  Expose const   return MyDevice  codepre blockquote  pand would be used like thisp  blockquote precodeDeviceExposegtExecuteFunctiona, b, c codepre blockquote  pNow codeMyDevicecode is a codestdsharedptrltDevicegtcode, Im not sure how to return it for dereferencing.  The obvious choice isp  blockquote precodestdsharedptrltDevicegt Expose      return MyDevice  codepre blockquote  pbut I worry about performance, particularly the creation of a new temporary codestdsharedptrcode.  So I need some way of saying you can dereference this pointer but you cant copy it.  The original still needs to be shared because many objects will hold a reference to it.p  pI hope Ive articulated my question adequately.  Thanks.p

Negative 1386 pI have the following understanding of the codegit add filecode and codegit checkout  filecode but I am not sure if it is correct.p  pWhenever we edit files with a text editor, we do it in the working directory. Each time we can move file to the so called codestaging areacode by executing codegit add filenamecode. If we edit the file again after codegit addcode we change the file in the working directory and in this way, in the working directory we have the file in a new state while in the codestaging areacode the file is in the old state.p  pWhen we use codegit addcode again, we bring the file in the staging area to the new state the state from the working directory.p  pIf we do codegit checkout  filenamecode, I assume that we take a file from the staging area and use it to overwrite the file in the working directory. In this way we can bring the file in the working directory to the old state. Is it correctp  pWhat is also not clear to me, is if we copy or move the file from the staging area. In other words, does codegit checkout  filecode change the state of the file in the codestaging areacode. Can we say that after codegit checkout  filecode the file in the staging area change the state of the file to its previous state in the staging area p

Negative 1386 pFirst id like to mention that ive been researching about this for few days and although i found some answers that should have been helpful i was unable to use them correctly due to the fact that i am not that much into programming yet and got no experience and might be missing something. p  pStraight to the point, i have a registration form and i need field validation i already have the one that validate email and empty fields for others but i need to add to the code a part that would reject numerical entries in name fields and alphabetical characters for ID field and to limit the length of a field. p  pLets start with the Name field which i want to allow alphabetical characters only here is my current codep  precode var fndocument.forms[myForm][FirstName].value if fnnull  fn      alertFirst name must be filled out   return false    codepre  pAnd thats my ID field which i want to limit to numerical entries only p  precode   var iddocument.forms[myForm][ID].value   if idnull  id      alertID must be filled out   return false    codepre  pI want to a couple of lines that would limit entries to a specific number of characters as well, how do i do thatp
Negative 1386 pstrongasync await support within actorsstrongp  pIm porting the actor lib Akka to .NET a hrefhttpsgithub.comrogeralsingPigeon relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrogeralsingPigeona I want to add strongasyncawaitstrong support eminsideem my actors.p  pThis gives me some problems right now since if I use the default scheduler, the await continuation will run wo respect to the actors concurrency boundarys. Meaning, the continuation may run when the actor is processing a message since that would lead to two threads accessing the actors internal state at the same time.p  pIf I could somehow schedule the the tasks to the actors own mailbox, and complete the task in the mailbox run, this would solve the problem.p  precode public class SomeActor  UntypedActor         protected override OnReceiveobject message                   if message is SomeMessage                           DoAsyncStuff                           private async void DoAsyncStuff                  var res  await something..           this code will not respect the actor concurrency boundary           since it can run at the same time as OnReceive           Console.WriteLineres          codepre  pI do have a thread static context for the actor, so when the actor is executing, this context is set.

So far so good.p  pI just dont know what to do next. Can I just over write the current TaskScheduler Is that thread static  I just want to apply this scheduler when an actor is running, it may not affect code running outside the actors.p  pIs this possible at all to apply custom task schedulers for specific actions onlyp
Negative 1386 pI get a cluster of which the nodes are connected in fat tree IB. The switches are Qlogic 12300.p  pThe problem I have is certain nodes cant talk with each other. Even there are other nodes, which can talk with both of the impacted nodes.p  pI used ibtracert to diag the problem. The amazing thing is if I run that command on a separate node which can talk with both the nodes, they are fine and reported a feasible route.p  pHowever the ibtracert command run into error if I issued it from the two impacted nodes.p  pCan I ask what the likely reason for thisp  pThanks. p
Negative 1386 pI am working on a 3D DICOM file. After it is read using MATLAB, for example I see that it contains some text information apart from the actual scan image. I mean text which is visible in the image when I do implay, not the header text in the DICOM file. Is there any way by which I can load only the raw data without the text The text is hindering my processing.p  pEDIT I cannot share the image Im working on due to it being proprietary, but I found the following image after googlingbr img srchttpwww.microsoft.comcasestudiesresourcesImages4000010832image7.jpeg althttpwww.microsoft.comcasestudiesresourcesImages4000010832image7.jpeg p  pNotice how the text on the left side partially overlaps the image There is a similar effect in the image Im working on.

Negative 1386 pI am looking into coding my own 3d audio rendering system as an educational project and because i have determined that technologies such as OpenAL are too deviceoriented and feature lacking for my use.  I would like it to be as flexible as possible.  To that end, I have begun considering how I should go about coding it such that I can build signal chains from smaller pieces in programs that make use of it.  I can conceptually handle the case in which everything is just acyclic paths, but dont know what to do with cycles.  That is, how does one handle the case when an object depends on its current output sample to calculate its current output signal, either directly or indirectly  The only two things I can think of are these the program enters an infinite loop and crashes, or I artificially add latency when such dependencies occur.  Research turned up no information on this issue.p

But when we compare the file that the browser saved to the file on the server, they are not the same.p  pThen I commented out the if mimeType  null line so that the MIME type would always be set to applicationoctetstream, and the downloaded file still wasnt identical to the one on the server.p  pAny idea why the downloaded file isnt exactly the same as the file on the serverp  pEDIT This is really strange.  I tested a text file, a PDF file, a ZIP file created in Windows, a JPG file, and they all download exact copies.  Just this file.tar.gz doesnt get downloaded exactly for some reason on the server its 882,273 bytes, and the downloaded copy is 881,968 bytes.p  pEDIT 2 When I use curl to download the file.tar.gz, it gets saved as an exact copy, so that tells me theres nothing wrong with the servlet code.  Chrome is modifying the file before it saves it for some reason.  Could Chrome be detecting that the file is a gzipped file and thinks that the server compressed the response when it really didnt, so it tries to uncompress it  Then again the file that Chrome saves is smaller than the file on the server...p

Negative 1386 pI am trying to implement a genetic algorithm for my Masters Thesis relating to satellite constellation design.  I want to obtain paretofronts for multiple objective functions.  I am writing my own algorithm based on a NonDominated Rank based Sorting Genetic Algorithm by Ashish Ghosh and Mrinal Kanti Das  a hrefhttpwww.isical.ac.inashMrinalfi08.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.isical.ac.inashMrinalfi08.pdfa  which is based on the NSGAII.  This algorithm uses elitism by combining the parent and child populations into a single set of individuals, size 2N, and then selecting the N best individuals to become the new child population, where N is the size of the initial population.  The fitness is based on nondominated fronts, the ranking within each front, and the spacing between individuals in that front. p  pThe algorithm I wrote works fine until nearly every individual in the combined parentchild population is in the first nondominated front they are all nondominated.  When this occurs, the only thing that distinguishes fitness between every individual is the spacing between individuals.  Therefore, I could have an individual that performs very well and should be passed on to the next generation, but it does not get selected for because it may be close to another individual.  If I take a plot of every solution over the entire GA run, there are some solutions in the first nondominated front at the end of the GA that are dominated by previous individuals that did not get passed on to the next generation.  This could be a problem with my code, but after thinking about the way the algorithm works, I am wondering if it is a problem with the algorithm.  p  pThanks for your helpp  pHere is my Pseudo Codep  ol lipInitialize random population of size N.pli lipCompute the fitness, f, of each individual for each objective function.pli lipClassify each individual into nondominated fronts nondominated solutions go into first front, then discard solutions in first front and the next set of nondominated solutions go into second front, until entire population is sorted into sets of nondominated fronts.pli lipAssign ranks to each solution, where the rank of solution i is the number of solutions that dominate solution i.pli lipCalculate the minimum distance between solution i and the next closest solution in the same front as solution i, for all i.pli lipCompute the new fitness value, F, based on front, rank, and minimum distancep  pThe average fitness value Favg is assigned to the first front where Favgi  N for all solutions i in front 1 and N  number of individuals in populationp  pThe average fitness for each individual in current front is then adjusted based on rank where, Fadji  Favgi  gi for all solutions i in current front, and where gi is the number of solutions in the same front as solution I having rank less than or equal to that of solution ip  pThe density factor is then considered where Fi  Fadji  1Min, where Min is the minimum distance between solution I and the next closest solution in the same front as solution i, and Fi is the final fitness value of solution ip  pIf Fj is the minimum fitness of solution j and Fj lt 0 then add 0  Fj to the fitness of all solutions to make them positivep  pThe Favg value is assigned for the next front, Favgii  Favgi  e, where e is some small value thereby ensuring the fitness values of front f is less than that of any solution of front f1pli lipNext perform the genetic operations tournament based selection, crossover, and mutation to obtain a child population of size N.pli lipCompute the fitness, f, of each individual in the child population for each objective function.pli lipCombine the parent population and child population into a single set of size 2N.pli lipNext repeat steps 36 to classify and compute the fitness F of the combined parentchild population.pli lipPerform elitism by sorting the fitness values, F, of the combined population.

That simple code is as follows, and the result will be undefined. p  precodefunction withSuccessobj console.logobj.parsed[0][2]  codepre  pWhy Please Help.  Thank you.p

Negative 1386 pI seem to be caught between two design guidelines.p  pI have a class that represents a threedimensional volume, that is made of blocks. This class provides simple modification methods, such as emAddBlockem or emRemoveBlockem.p  pThere are several things I need to do with this classp  pFirst, i need to know certain aggregate properties about the volume, with methods such as emGetTotalWeightem or emGetMaximumWidthem.p  pSecond, i need to perform transformation operations over this volumes, such as emShrinkem or emTrimem, which do pretty much what the names tell you no need to go into detail, volumes just change according to some rules, by adding or removing blocks. These operations have lots of logic in them.p  pMy question is If I add these query and transformation methods to the emVolumeem class, does this break the strongsingle responsibility principlestrong My classes responsibilities would bep  ul liHold the volume data, allowing simple modifications add and remove blocksli liProvide aggregate information about the volumeli liProvide transform capabilities for these volumes.li ul  pIf I decide this is too much responsibility, and that the emVolumeem class should just represent the volume, I would need to create classes such as emVolumeTrimmerem, emVolumeShrinkerem, and so on, for the transformations, and emWeightCalculatorem for the queriesp  pThis last option seems to neatly separate the concerns in different classes. However, if I look at the details of the emTrimVolume vem of my emVolumeTrimmerem, all it does is call operations over volume. At the same time, the emCalculateWeightVolume vem method of my emWeightCalculatorem seems to be mostly concerned with emVolumeem.p  pWhen I look at this kind of method, I feel compelled to use the strongMove Methodstrong refactoring. I look at the code and say this method is mostly concerned with the properties of another class, therefore i better move this method to this class. But this brings the responsibility back to the emVolumeem classp  pAny ideas on how should I approach this problem Am I understanding these guidelines wrongp

Negative 1386 pFirst, Ill claim no extreme expertise in SQL. p  pWhat I am trying to do is pull down some incident counts from a SQL Server database based on a couple of varying criteria and put them into SSRS in a line chart that shows monthly counts on top of each other.  Both of the queries that I had initially created pull down the right data but SSRS will not allow for using multiple data sets on one chart.  This is where I get hung up.  Im sure I can do some sort of subquerying to get both data sets into one just separating the counts into columns, but what Ive tried thus far aggregates the entire counts.p  pThe data I need is the reporteddate which is a datetime value and a count of incidents that occurred no need to aggregate the counts, or shouldnt be, since SSRS will allow me to group them by month, which is what the report should look like matching each of the 2 criteria.p  pBelow are the two queries that I am usingp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT vIncident.ReportedDate, COUNT AS Count FROM            vIncident INNER JOIN                          vIncidentMaxWorkLogCategory ON vIncident.IncidentID  vIncidentMaxWorkLogCategory.IncidentNumber WHERE        vIncident.Summary LIKE NIntelligent Incident for Impacted CI AND vIncident.CustomerFirstName  NBMC AND                           vIncident.CustomerLastName  NImpact Manager AND vIncidentMaxWorkLogCategory.WORKLOGTYPE IN General Information, Incident Task  Action,                           Working Log AND vIncident.ReportedDate gt 712014 AND vIncident.ReportedDate gt DATEADDyear,  1, GETDATE GROUP BY vIncident.ReportedDate FROM vIncident codepre  pSecond Queryp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT vIncident.ReportedDate, COUNT AS Count FROM            vIncident INNER JOIN                          vIncidentMaxWorkLogCategory ON vIncident.IncidentID  vIncidentMaxWorkLogCategory.IncidentNumber WHERE        vIncident.Summary LIKE NIntelligent Incident for Impacted CI AND vIncident.CustomerFirstName  NBMC AND                           vIncident.CustomerLastName  NImpact Manager AND vIncident.ReportedDate gt 712014 AND vIncident.ReportedDate gt DATEADDyear,  1, GETDATE GROUP BY vIncident.ReportedDate FROM vIncident codepre  pAs you can see, I am pulling down the reporteddate and a count.  If I simply bring those two statements together in a single statement [select query1 as filtered, query2 as base] and move the group bys to the outside, I get results, but it is the entire total for each value on every single line, and about 10k lines too many.p  pIs there a simple solution that will get me each date, and a single count for base and filtered using these 2 or similar queries  Thank you very much in advancep

Negative 1386 pWhen using the WebJobs SDK what is the proper way to move a BrokeredMessage to the deadletter queue  Usually I would just call msg.DeadLetter.  However, the SDK takes care of managing the life cycle of the brokered message.  It will call msg.Complete if the method returns successful, and it will retry the message if an exception occurs. I need the 3rd case of telling the ServiceBus queue to move the message to the deadletter queue as it is a bad message.p

Negative 1386 pSimplified Questionp  pIs it practical for a programmer to keep track of the addresses of variables, so that a variables address can be used as a point of data on that variable p  pOriginal Questionp  pI am attempting to wrap my head around how variables are stored and referenced by address using pointers in Go.p  pAs a general principal, is it ever useful to assign a variables address directly  I can imagine a situation in which data could be encoded in the physical virtual address of a variable, and not necessarily the value of that variable.p  pFor instance, the 1000th customer has made a 500 dollars of purchases. Could I store an interger at location 1000 with a value of 500p  pI know that the common way to do something like this is with an array, where the variable at position 999 corresponds to the 1000th customer, but my question is not about arrays, its about assigning addresses directly.p  pSuppose Im dealing with billions of objects.  Is there an easy way to use the address as part of the data on the object, and the value stored at that location as different datap  pfor instance, an int at address 135851851904 holds a value of 46876, 135851851905 holds 123498761, etc. I imagine at this point an array or slice would be far too large to be efficient.p  pIncidentally, if my question due to a misunderstanding, is there a resource someone can provide which explains the topic in deep, but understandable detail  I have been unable to find a good resource on the subject that really explains the details.p

For examplep  pcodecontext.transforma, b, c, d, e, fcodep  pHowever, the links also have these notesp  blockquote   pThe methods listed below remain for historical and compatibility   reasons as SVGMatrix objects are used in most parts of the API   nowadays and will be used in the future instead.p blockquote    blockquote   pMost of the API uses SVGMatrix objects rather than this API. This API   remains mostly for historical reasonsp blockquote  pDespite the pages saying that most of the API now uses codeSVGMatrixcode objects instead of specifying individual matrix elements, I cant seem to find documentation for this.p  pCan someone point me to some official documentation, or otherwise describe the API that makes use of codeSVGMatrixcode objects instead of specifying individual matrix elements p
Negative 1386 pI have been searching for a string library or set of tools which do not store strings on the heap, but only on the stack all are known for size etc at compiletime, but contents might vary. p  pI am not looking for char arrays, because I want to ensure typesafety boundary checks etc. Could you think of a library which does some not all  that would be impossible of the functions from the original stdstring libraryp  pAs I am working on a C project for embedded systems with very little memory  lt256 kb flash, I cannot use any std references, as they tend to include exceptions and references to other std libraries.p  pAn other reason why i dont want to use the stdstring library is that I do not want the available memory to fragment, hence the fixed length.p
Negative 1386 pOkay.p  pSo Ive been trying to implement a doublylinked list with a swap function. p  pIve found many sites online that explain how to do this  and in almost all of them including a few from Stack Overflow, an argument begins in the comments about whether or not the implementation is correct. I have tried several of them to no avail. In other words, I cant find a single definitive version of this algorithm. p  pI have tried at least 45 different algorithms from those I found online, as well as a few I tried to sort out myself, but I keep getting issues with the elements being sorted incorrectly. I am completely at my wits end. p  pHere is the most recent version I tried, which does not work p  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void PriorityQueueltTgtswapNode  n1, Node  n2     ifn1  n2         return     ifn1  0  n2  0         stdcout ltlt nPRIORITYQUEUE ERROR Trying to swap with nonexistent noden         return           Node  temp  new Node      tempgtprev  n1gtprev     tempgtnext  n1gtnext      n1gtprev  n2gtprev     n1gtnext  n2gtnext      n2gtprev  tempgtprev     n2gtnext  tempgtnext      ifn1gtnext  0         n1gtnextgtprev  n2     ifn1gtprev  0         n1gtprevgtnext  n2     ifn2gtnext  0         n2gtnextgtprev  n1     ifn2gtprev  0         n2gtprevgtnext  n1      delete temp   codepre  pI am beyond frustrated. Would somebody please, please, please help me out by showing me a complete, working algorithm. Not linking to a page with a broken algorithm and comments on how to fix it which I have tried a few times now, but just the algorithm. It doesnt even need to be code, just an algorithm. Please. I am so tired of trying to fix this and so behind schedule on this project and I will be so eternally grateful if someone out there can definitely help me solve this once and for all.p

Negative 1386 pIm currently trying to enable or disable validation if certain conditions. If the startdate or enddate has something entered it will validate both fields to check if valid, if startdate is entered then enddate must be too and vice versa.

I think i have go the correctly logic but i need to be able to clear the validation because if i enter the startdate and enddate then clear these the validation will still show. This also still happens if i click the clear button within the date textboxes.

Negative 1386 pIm trying to selectively enforce validations on a model. I want the model to enforce them when data is entered from users, but when running files in I want to ignore the validations sometimes.

Seemed great until I need to update from the file and now I basically have to switch the boolean on all the records. Here is some of my codep  precodeclass Identity lt ActiveRecordBase     validate validatespouseage, if gt webadd    validates ssn, length  is 9      def validatespouseage       if relationship  S  relationship  DP ampamp dob.nil ampamp webadd ampamp agelt16       errors.adddob, spouseunderage     end     true    end end codepre  pSo on the web form I just add a hiddenfiedl setting webadd to true and the validation runs and that gets saved to the record. But now when I want to run the following I have to set the boolean back to false or the validation will still run.p  precodeidentity.webaddfalse to allow it to be updated without validation fails identity.updateattributes     namefirst          line.FIRSTNAME,     namelast           line.LASTNAME      codepre  pIm sure there is a smarter way to do this. Why Im not just ignoring the validation completely is there are some validations that I want to run regardless of the data source. For example, the SSN needs to be there or it should fail out.p  pAny help would be more then appreciatedp

Negative 1386 pIve an application that popup a window with a ShowDialog. The ShowDialog can be called many times in the app life cycle.p  pSo, I wonder if that possible simply to set the Window location to CenterOwner by default like now. But if the user change the position of the window, in the life cycle of the main app, next time it will popup at the previous location.  But next time he will run the app, the window will popup in the CenterOwner.p  pstrongIs it possible without a lot of code behind strongp  pThanks. Hope Ive been clear.p

A EigenMap allows to access raw memory as a kind of EigenMatrix. The dataMap is of typep  precodeltconst EigenMatrixXdgt codepre  psince the associated memory is read only resultMap in contrast is of typep  precodeltEigenMatrixXdgt codepre  psince it must we writeable. The linep  precoderesultMap0,0  100 codepre  pshows, that resultMap is in deed writeable. While passing dataMap to the npMatrix where a const EigenMatrixXd is expected works, I could not find a way to pass resultMap in the same way. I am sure, the trouble comes from the fact, that the first argument of npMatrix is const, and the second is not. A possible solution I found is to definep  precodeEigenMatrixXd resultMatrix  resultMap codepre  pand pass this resutlMatrix to npMatrix. However, I guess, this creates a copy and hence kills the nice memory mapping of EigenMap. So my question is.p  pIs there a way to pass a EigenMap to a function which expects a nonconst EigenMatrixXd insteadp  pAs a side note I could change npMatrix to expect a EigenMap, but since in the real project, functions are already there and tested, I would rather not temper with them.p  pTo complete the question, here is the python file to call pyMatrixp  precodeimport ctypes as ct import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   Load libfit and define input types ct.cdll.LoadLibraryhomewmaderMethodsfdmbrefactorbuildpyinterfacelibpyfit.so libfit  ct.CDLLlibpyfit.so  libfit.pyMatrix.argtypes  [np.ctypeslib.ndpointerdtypenp.float64, ndim2,                                                      np.ctypeslib.ndpointerdtypenp.int32, ndim1,                                                      np.ctypeslib.ndpointerdtypenp.float64, ndim2, flagsWRITEABLE,                                                      np.ctypeslib.ndpointerdtypenp.int32, ndim1                                                      ]  data  np.arraynp.random.randn10, 2, dtypenp.float64, orderF result  np.zeroslikedata, dtypenp.float64, orderF  libfit.pyMatrixdata, np.arraydata.shape, dtypenp.int32,                               result, np.arrayresult.shape, dtypenp.int32 codepre
Negative 1386 pDoes it make sense to modify a mean.io generated mean stack project to work with mySQL instead of MongoDB  I just started a developing job, and Im making a project using the mean stack I guess without the m.

Negative 1386 pFor my project i made a dictionary that has a random double and a string that belongs to that double codeDictionaryltdouble, stringgt myDict  new Dictionaryltdouble, stringgtcodep  pFor this project i know that the double is a random value, and within the dictionaries all strings are unique, with the exception that about 80 one of them is twice in the dictionary. So what i want to do, is find the 2 strings that are a pair the same string and find the 2 double values that belong to these 2 string.p  pBasically my idea of doing this is by using codeIEnumerator counter  myDict.GetEnumeratorcode and use the codewhile counter.MoveNext  truecode to start another IEnumerator that loops again through all the entries of the dictionary and compares by string, so if will find the pairs this way. So for each entry in the dictionary, it will loop through the whole dictionary again to find pairs.p  pNow i get the feeling this might not be the best solution to handle this. Are there alternatives to find the pairs in the dictionary, or is this looping through the only real way of doing thisp

Negative 1386 pGood morning,p  pIm working on a small project to help people to take care of some vegetable species. So Ive done an expandableListView in order to group the species, and each group each specie has 7 children. When clicking on any child, Id like the program to call my itemtext.xml, where I put a textView only to show the text related to the clicked child of that group.p  pIm not managing to do this calling. So I decided to make it in another way using switch, just to see its layout working. But instead of calling a text page, Ive programmed it to show a simple toast message for each clicked childp  pHere is this part of the code linesp  precodeexpListView.setOnChildClickListenernew OnChildClickListener           Override         public boolean onChildClickExpandableListView parent, View v,                                     int groupPosition, int childPosition, long id               switch childPosition                               case 0                     Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext,                              Adubao da espcie   listDataHeader.getgroupPosition,                             Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                 break                 .                 .                 . codepre  pAnother point is that my main is getting too large because I intend to pool together more than 30 species on this project, with the same 7 children each one. So I ask for hints about that too, cause until last month, I had studied only C programming, and recently started studying object oriented programming, so until the moment I couldnt come with a good idea to reduce the code lines. So I ask for help from the more experienced on that too, if possible.

Negative 1386 pIn Java Collection Framework, a lot of implmentations mention about their performance in the Javadoc. For example, HashSets saysp  blockquote   pThis class offers constant time performance for the basic operations add, remove, contains and size, assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets. Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of the HashSet instances size the number of elements plus the capacity of the backing HashMap instance the number of buckets.p blockquote  pAnd ArrayLists saysp  blockquote   pThe size, isEmpty, get, set, iterator, and listIterator operations run in constant time.p blockquote  pBut LinkedLists says nothing about its performance.p  pI believe codepopcode and codepushcode method of LinkedList runs in constant time as linked list in computer science does. But Im worry that It is okay to suppose that when I implement a method which has a LinkedList parameter.p  pDoes LinkedList has any reason not to say its performancep

I noticed while troubleshooting this, that the following query was in the process list and never seemed to finishp  precodeSELECT  FROM   motorcycles        LEFT JOIN motorcycleyear               ON motorcycleyear.yearid  motorcycles.motorcyclevyear        LEFT JOIN motorcyclemake               ON motorcyclemake.makeid  motorcycles.motorcyclevmake        LEFT JOIN dealers               ON dealers.dealerid  motorcycles.motorcycledealer        LEFT JOIN motorcyclesubtype               ON subtypeid  motorcyclesubtype        LEFT JOIN fueltype               ON fuelid  motorcyclefuel WHERE  motorcycleid  3885         OR 1073  Sleep5            AND motorcycledealer  91  codepre  pAt first I thought it was a bug in the clients code, but then I determined it must be the result of SQL injection because of this partp  precodeWHERE  motorcycleid  3885         OR 1073  Sleep5            AND motorcycledealer  91  codepre  pSo it seems like some sort of sql injection DOS attack.  For technical reasons that I dont understand, this query never seems to complete.p  pI tried to reproduce it in a simpler context with a test table and a simple queryp  precodeSELECT  FROM   users WHERE  id  9000         OR 1073  Sleep5            AND foo  bar codepre  pBut as I expected, it finished in roughly 5 seconds.  So why does the former query never complete  Does it have to do with the joins  Id like to understand this out of pure curiosity at this point.p  pIf this is better suited for another stack exchange forum, feel free to migrate the question there.p  pEdit  And just to be clear, the former query the one that seems to be a DOS sql injection returns almost instantly if I replace with similar, but saner values likep  precodeWHERE motorcycleid  1 AND motorcycledealer  91 codepre

Negative 1386 pI am trying to convert an expression containing terms with various degrees of a symbolic variable codezscode into a polynomial in python using codesympy.Polycode so that I can then extract the coefficients using code.coeffscode.p  pThe expression I have is a highorder polynomial with independent, symbolic variable zs.  For some reason, when I convert the expression into a polynomial using sympy.Poly, it seems to chop off the terms with small coefficients.  Below is my function, and I included the line where I redefined it as a symbolic polynomialp  precodef  1.29096669270427e61zs33  6.24438995041203e59zs32  6.41125090009095e57zs31  8.30852813320818e55zs30  5.84175807723288e53zs29  1.88577332997761e50zs28  9.46504910106607e49zs27  2.28903644846359e46zs26  4.63321594171589e44zs25  1.78254194888339e42zs24  6.43406800910469e40zs23  1.20425521347205e37zs22  3.4116753522246e36zs21  1.92084369416715e33zs20  3.04107684362554e31zs19  2.89289551256439e30zs18  6.38382842182985e27zs17  5.46438700248253e25zs16  8.50501280745176e23zs15  1.6344595302306e20zs14  1.07764488797684e18zs13  3.47026242660686e16zs12  2.93966702403133e14zs11  5.25394006214533e12zs10  1.21642330162702e9zs9  1.16577645027166e7zs8  6.82117624588787e6zs7  0.000267513120031891zs6  0.00723589681411793zs5  0.134846078975788zs4  1.69035817278476zs3  13.5277365002646zs2  62.3459673862853zs  76.5029927727737 sympy.Polyf,zs codepre  pThis returns p  precodePoly2.93966702403133e14zs11  5.25394006214533e12zs10  1.21642330162702e9zs9  1.16577645027166e7zs8  6.82117624588787e6zs7  0.000267513120031891zs6  0.00723589681411793zs5  0.134846078975788zs4  1.69035817278476zs3  13.5277365002646zs2  62.3459673862853zs  76.5029927727737, zs, domainRR codepre  pAs you can see, the first several terms were taken out.p  pAt first I thought it was cutting off my highorder terms because there was some builtin cutoff for highorder polynomials, but I could not find that to be the case in any documentation.  I then discovered that the terms that are being cut off seem to be cut off because of the low coefficient value I assume sympy or python thinks that the term is negligible because its coefficient is so close to zero.  You can see in my function that the first term has a coefficient of approximately code1.3e61code.  I tested this theory using a simple example of a 2term polynomial with degree 1 that has a small term cut offp  precodeh  10e27zs  1 sympy.Polyh,zs codepre  pEDIT The code 1code should have been within the codehcode function, I just fixed it so it reads correctly. This does not change the output. This returnsp  precodePoly1.0, zs, domainRR codepre  pAs you can see, the term containing the coefficient code10e27code was dropped out of the polynomial, and only the constant code1.0code remains.p  pI could not find any information on this on multiple forums, or in the SymPy documentation unless I missed it.  I did, however, find that people were trying to do the exact opposite of what I was trying to do see a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicsympyPss3MQeIeUA relnofollowherea, for example they were trying to cut off terms with small coefficients, whereas I am trying to PREVENT python from cutting off those terms.p  pIs there a way to tell pythonsympy that I do not want those small coefficients set to zerop  pOr, to bypass this problem, is there another way to extract the coefficients from my original function in order without using codesympy.Polycode and code.coeffscodep

Negative 1386 pIn Fortran, there are two standard ways to return a result from a function. The first one is by assigning the return value of the function to the function name.p  precodefunction foo     integer  foo      foo  10 end function foo codepre  pThe second form, standardized in Fortran 90 is through a result variable.p  precodefunction foo resultres     integer  res      res  10  end function foo codepre  pCalling either form of the function returns the value 10. My question is, what was the rationale of the Fortran 90 committee for introducing result variables Were they standardizing a common practice Or were they allowing programs to be more modular by not tying the function name to a function result. For example, in the second version of codefoocode, the name of the function codefoocode could be changed to codebarcode and the function would still work as expected when called.p  pHowever, I may be wrong. Does anyone know what the actual rationale was for introducing result variablesp

Negative 1386 pI am trying to write a Python program that accesses a very large .txt file and reads lines randomly from it, multiple times, in parallel. I am using a machine with a lot of memory, so I am storing the file as an array of strings using code.readlinescode.p  pInitially, I was storing the array as a global variable, until I realised that a copy was being created for each process. strongIm looking for a way to store this array in shared memory to be accessed by all processes but not modified.strongp  pI tried storing the array in a codeManager.listcode, but the program just froze. Then I tried storing it as a codemultiprocessing.Arraycode of type codectypes.ccharpcode, which seems to work, except codemultiprocessing.Poolcode does not seem to take it as an argument.p  pA simplified examplep  precodefrom multiprocessing.pool import Pool import multiprocessing import ctypes import random  def main     file  openfoo.txt,r     sharedfile  openbar.txt,r     lines  file.readlines     sharedlines  multiprocessing.Arrayctypes.ccharp,sharedfile.readlines     file.close     sharedfile.close      processpool  Pool     numtimes  8     for i in rangenumtimes         processpool.applyasyncselectline, [lines,i]     processpool.close     processpool.join      processpool  Pool     numtimes  16     for i in range8,numtimes         processpool.applyasyncselectline, [sharedlines,i]     processpool.close     processpool.join  def selectlinelines,outfp     outfile  openstroutfp  .txt,w     line  lines[random.randint0,lenlines1]     outfile.writeline  main codepre  pIn the above example, files 07 are created correctly, with a line selected at random from codefoo.txtcode, but files 815 are not created at all, i.e. the processes do not run, and produce no error messages.p  pInterestingly, when I assign the processes manually as codemultiprocessing.Processcode objects, this seems to work as expected, but not with codePoolcode. Anybody have any idea whyknow a way around thisp  pstrongTLDR, does anybody know of a way to get processes spawned by a codemultiprocessing.Poolcode object to share an array of strings, without making a copy for each and without using a codemultiprocessing.Managercode objectstrongp  pstrongEDIT My question is more or less answered herestrong a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1675766howtocombinepoolmapwitharraysharedmemoryinpythonmultiprocessingHow to combine Pool.map with Array shared memory in Python multiprocessinga strongMy understanding is, to use a codeSynchronizedArraycode with Pool, it must be global, and to pass it explicitly, you must use codemultiprocessing.Processcodestrongp

Negative 1386 pI am not sure in understanding the Database Locks. I am using the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiIsolationdatabasesystemsRepeatablereads relnofollowrepeatable read isolation levela. According to wikipedia it keeps read and write locks acquired on selected data until the end of the transaction. Lets consider the following scenario Lets have two threads A, B. Thread A  begins a transaction. Lets say thread A retrieves a list of all users from table User. I am expecting here that Thread A acquired readampwrite locks on all users  Thread B begins another transaction, retrieves one concrete User u from table User and updates the User u then commits the transaction Since A acquired the locks, does the Thread B has to wait until A commits the transaction br Is the describes behavior to expect if using JPA br Is the lock acquired if the Thread A reads the users outside a transaction Lets say if I am using the Extended Peristence Context   p

Negative 1386 pI know there are a lot of naming conventions to build apps name database tables in the singular, models in uppercase, and packages all lowercase, but I havent found any recommendations to name related elements.

Negative 1386 pAs a programming exercise I thought it would be fun to try to write a program which uses multiple threads the generate a random number. This method would introduce the chaos of the OS scheduler to add randomness.p  pThe idea of 32 threads is that each thread will set a single bit of a number left shift and or with a random 01. They each generate the random bit from a Mersenne Twister engine and just and with 1. EDIT As Jarod42 pointed out, each thread cant share the same random engine. Assume each thread owns its own engine.p  precodestdmt19937 engsome stdseedseq to initialize codepre  pAt this point, I will describe my ideas towards implementation.p  pOne option is to launch the threads each time the function is called.p  precodeunsigned int GetRandom      stdvectorltstdthreadgt myThreads     stdmutex numMutex     unsigned int num  0     auto BitSetFunction  [amp]         stdlockguardltstdmutexgt numLockGuardnumMutex         num ltlt 1         num  eng amp 1          for int i0 ilt32 i          myThreads.emplacemyThreads.end, BitSetFunction          for stdvectorltstdthreadgtiterator itmyThreads.begin itmyThreads.end it          it.join          return num  codepre  pHowever the problem I suspected, and sometimes see, is that the creation of the thread is usually slower than the actual locking, setting of the bit, and unlocking. If that is the case the threads will just execute in order and it wont be as interesting. Also the overhead of creating threads for every call to get a random number is huge Im assuming.p  pIs there a more clever way I thought of creating an object and from its construction the threads are launched and always running but waiting on a condition variable to know when to crank out a new random number. The problem I hit there was on the destruction of the object, the threads are also destroyed and throw errors because theyre still executing.p  pIm just curious to hear some other ideas.p

Negative 1386 pI have an ETL process that will run periodically. I was using kettle PDI to extract the data from the source database and copy it to a stage database. For this I use several transformations with table input and table output steps. However, I think I could get inconsistent data if the source database is modified during the process, since this way I dont get a snapshot of the data. Furthermore, I dont know if the source database would be blocked. This would be a problem if the extraction takes some minutes and it will take them. The advantage of PDI is that I can select only the necessary columns and use timestamps to get only the new data.p  pBy the other hand, I think mysqldump with singletransaction allows me to get the data in a consistent way and dont block the source database all tables are innodb. The disadventage is that I would get innecessary data.p  pCan I use PDI, or I need mysqldumpp  pPD I need to read specific tables from specific databases, so I think xtrabackup its not a good option.p

But, for that, I needed 10 reputation points, which I, as a newbie, have not. p  pSo Im obliged to start from scratch. My suggestion was to develop even further the subject including the consequences of session handling at the database level. My doubt appeared when meddling with strongGrailsstrong and I developed a very simplistic app that created some entities  automatically persisted to the database by strongGORMstrong. p  pI didnt expect to be able to list those entities from another session i.e. from another browser Firefox vs. Chrome  in the same machine, since, for all purposes, these two requests represent different users and, the sessionhandling mechanism should transparently avoid one user accessing data from another. So, my question is how databases GORM, whatever take session in account and return data from the session user only. p  pMoreover, what is the bare minimum code necessary to get this  behavior in Grails in case it is not transparently provided by the frameworkp

Negative 1386 pIm an ELKI beginner, and Ive been using it to cluster around 10K latlon points from a .csv file. Once I get my settings correct, Id like to scale up to 1MM points.p  pIm using the OPTICSXi algorithm with LngLatDistanceFunctionp  pI keep reading about enabling Rtree index with STR bulk loading in order to see vast improvements in performance. The tutorials havent helped me much.p  pAny tips on how I can implement this feature p
Negative 1386 pI am keen to achieve a high level of security for credentials that are used to connect to external services, such as APIs that are billed.p  pIf I store credentials in a C library as a .so binary and access them using JNI with the application signing key, does that sound like sufficient protectionp  pIm trying to gauge the ease with which an attacker might be able to decompile or otherwise reverse engineer in order to access the credentials.p

Negative 1386 pTrying to find an example of how to build an application using solr 5.x with djangohaystack, but most examples online are using solr 4.x or solr 3.x. Can anyone give some instructions on how to work with solr 5.x using djangohaystack, or just offer some example project Thanksp
Negative 1386 pIm quite new to the Android and Java world Im trying to develop an app that need to get and insert information in a database. I searched on the net, and I found that the best solution is to use HTTP connection using PHP files with Jsons outputs as an interface between the application and the Mysql Db.p  pHowever, I cant figure out how to secure everything. Example To change the nickname of an user i connect my app to a php page with this codep  precodenickname  POST[nickname] id  POST[id] nicknameChangeid,nickname function nicknameChangeid,nickname global mysqli sql  UPDATE users SET nickname   WHERE id   stmt  mysqligtpreparesql stmtgtbindparamsi,nickname,id  stmtgtexecute  codepre  pVia post i pass the id of the user that wanna change nickname and the new nickname, how can i be sure that no one will manipulate that page passing to it ids of other users to change their nickname I read on the Net that an HTTPS connection may solve the problem, is that enoughp
Negative 1386 pI am trying to force the creation of a custom Alfresco content, which contains a imagejpeg. I create the content with a custom codeWebScriptcode. However, when I try to retrieve the preview, I get an error, as the codeThumbnail was not foundcode.p  pThe url I use to retrieve the preview isp  precodealfrescosapinodeworkspaceSpacesStoreltUUIDgtcontentthumbnailsmedium codepre  pI also append the following parametersp  precodeqcqueueampfcforce codepre  pto force preview creation on request. Conversely, when I go to Share, the preview is created in fact the previous url, without the parameters, shows the preview after visiting the content page in Share. Also, if I use the explicit preview creation service, it works, i.e. send a POST request to codealfrescosapinodeworkspaceSpacesStoreltUUIDgtcontentthumbnailscode with body codethumbnailNamemediumcode.p  pHow can I force the creation of the preview and obtain it with a single service invocationp  pThanks.p
Negative 1386 pSo I have the data the way I want it.  The only thing I need to change is adjusting the dates in the legend.  The way my data is structured in the line graph is the legend reads code20150101code , code20150202code , code20150303code, etc ..p  pI would like the legend in the graph to read codeJancode, codeFebcode, codeMarcode, codeAprcode, etc.p  pHeres the R code after the query.  The legend consists of the DateTrunc values.p  pI want to rename the legend, and ideally the axis, and title of the graph all in one function.

Negative 1386 pI have a python script which does many simulations for different parameters  strongcodeQcodestrong, strongcodeKcodestrong , plots results and stores it to disk.p  pEach set of parameters  codeQ,Kcode  produces a 3D volumetric grid of data 200x200x80 datapoints, which requires 100 MB of data. A part of this volumetric grid is then plot, layer by layer, producing 60 images.p  pThe problem is that python obviously does not release memory during this process.
