Positive 1926 pId like to dynamically add some new Types to a given Module based on some files found in a directory.p  pIm essentially trying to populate a bunch of codefile...code embed classes at the bottom of a Module.p  precodeThis is the module Im targeting to append embedded ByteArray subtypes see below buildmacros.AutoEmbed.buildsomefolder class Embeds      Empty on purpose, just let the Macro do its thing     At macrotime, it should generate these  filesomefolderuimain.xml class UIMAINXML extends flash.utils.ByteArray    filesomefolderconfig.template.json class CONFIGTEMPLATEJSON extends flash.utils.ByteArray   codepre  pWhat Ive been able to find so far is that I might have to alter the codeEmbeds.hxcode module.

Ive also looked into codeTypeDefinitioncode since it seems like the only way to define a new type from scratch. p  pThe problem with codeContext.getModule...code though is that it returns an array codeArrayltTypegtcode, not codeArrayltTypeDefinitiongtcode, so I cant append new codeTypeDefinitioncode to it plus I have to figure out how to write those, emughhem. Thats probably a bad assumption on my part, but I thought by simply appending more codeTypeDefinitioncode to it I could dynamically provide more types in the module.p  pIm still very new to Macros as you can tellp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIts true that I could just dynamically writeoverwrite a new codeEmbeds.hxcode file at compiletime with a strongFileSystem  File writestrong solution, but that implies needing to compile at least once before your IDEs autocompletion can pickup the generated codeEmbeds.code classes FlashDevelop in my case. Plus anytime new files are dropped in the defined folder, same problem you need to compile first before the IDE detects it. Yes, I really like autocompletion p

All Haskell functions must be parametric in their type parameters the functions must not care or make decisions based on the choices for these parameters. A function cant do one thing when a is Int and a different thing when a is Bool. Haskell simply provides no facility for writing such an operation. This property of a langauge is called parametricity.p      pThere are many deep and profound consequences of parametricity. One consequence is something called type erasure. Because a running Haskell program can never make decisions based on type information, all the type information can be dropped during compilation. Despite how important types are when writing Haskell code, they are completely irrelevant when running Haskell code. This property gives Haskell a huge speed boost when compared to other languages, such as Python, that need to keep types around at runtime. Type erasure is not the only thing that makes Haskell faster, but Haskell is sometimes clocked at 20x faster than Python.p blockquote  pWhat I dont understand is how are all Haskell functions parametric Arent types explicitstatic in Haskell Also I dont really understand how type erasure improves strikecompiling timestrike runtimep  pSorry if these questions are really basic, Im new to Haskell.p  pEDITp  pOne more question why does the author say that Despite how important types are when writing Haskell code, they are completely irrelevant when running Haskell codep

However, is it more efficient to declare them all on one linep  pIf I declare 3 variables on the same line and instantiate them all simultaneously, are they all bound to the same ObjectValue codeObject x,y,z  new Objectcode Or is x equal to a new instance of type codeObjectcode as well as codeycode and codezcode equal to new instances of codeObjectcodep  pIf I declare 3 variables on the same line and instantiate them all individually rather than do so on 3 separate lines, is it more efficient, or just a matter of opinion p  precodeObject x  new Object,y  new Object,z  new Object codepre

Positive 1926 pI am trying to create a class factory that uses a list of class types, calls overridden methods to find the class that matches the criteria, and then returns an instance of the matched class.

Negative 1926 pI am working on an attendanceovertime module for a schedule web app. The idea is that there is a table in MySQL of shifts, each shift having a start and end time.

Negative 1926 pIs it possible to limit CPU usage at SqlBulkCopy p  pWhen I execute my code see below, CPU usage on SQL server jumps to 100. Id like to limit this to, lets say, 50. Is this possiblep  pCodep  precodestring connectionString  ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[connectionString].ToString using SqlBulkCopy bulkCopy  new SqlBulkCopyconnectionString      bulkCopy.DestinationTableName  dbo.CSVFile     bulkCopy.BulkCopyTimeout  600     bulkCopy.BatchSize  1000     bulkCopy.WriteToServertableCSV  codepre  pEDIT This code is running on seperate machine from the db server. p  pWhy I need to limit CPU usage this SQL server has multiple databases, one of them is acceseed constantly from two computers, each of them does a couple of queries per second. This two computers operate two big machines, so every time one of this computer waits for his queries to execute, he stops his machine, waits for queries to execute and then runs his machine again.  So every time I run something on SQL server that consumes a lot of CPU, that stops some machines in production. p
Negative 1926 pIm doing some work with Genetic Algorithms and want to write my own GA classes. Since a GA can have different ways of doing selection, mutation, crossover, generating an initial population, calculating fitness, and terminating the algorithm, I need a way to plug in different combinations of these. My initial approach was to have an abstract class that had all of these methods defined as pure virtual, and any concrete class would have to implement them. If I want to try out two GAs that are the same but with different crossover methods for example, I would have to make an abstract class that inherits from GeneticAlgorithm and implements all the methods except the crossover method, then two concrete classes that inherit from this class and only implement the crossover method. The downside to this is that every time I want to swap out a method or two to try out something new I have to make one or more new classes. p  pIs there another approach that might apply better to this problemp

Negative 1926 pIm developing this app which as a very basic Ajax form and Im currently validating the form input through jQuery with its default validation plugin.p  pIm wondering if I should also do serverside validation after submitting the form or just ignore and assume everything is right since the clientside validation was successfulp  pTheres two things to keep in mind thoughp  pstrong1strong Although the form is capable of being submitted without JavaScript, the serverside script will not handle this behavior. I mean, the data will be processed and inserted into the database but it wont return anything, so the user would see an empty page after submitting the form. And besides, this application is strong on JavaScript and wont work without it its a Facebook application by the way.p  pstrong2strong Right now the application is very simple and theres only 2 options on that form. One is a textbox and its the only thing being validated its required and must be only digits. The other option is a set of radio buttons which by default will have one of them selected, so even if the user forgets about this option, something will be selected. Its basically the default value for this option there can be no default for the textbox though.p

Negative 1926 pMy problem is hydrating a Viewmodel from a Linq2Sql object that has been returned from the database.  We have done this in a few areas and have a nice layered pattern worked up for it but the latest item calls for some enums to be used and this has caused headaches all round.  Currently we pull back from the database then use Automapper to hydrate or flatten into our Viewmodels but having the enums in the model seems to be causing issues with Automapper.

Negative 1926 pFor a project Im working on I needed to create a treeview with dragdrop reordering. Before messing with the actual project, I subclassed treeview in a separate project and added handlers for the Drop, DragOver, MouseMove, and DragLeave events and implemented them as necessary. Drag and drop reordering works fine for the side project because I had it set up such that each TreeViewItem stores the item I am interested in in the Header property.p  pHere is some of the codep  precode       void MultiSelectTreeViewDropobject sender, System.Windows.DragEventArgs e              if e.Data.GetDataPresenttypeofTreeViewItem                      TreeViewItem sourceItem  TreeViewIteme.Data.GetDatatypeofTreeViewItem             TreeViewItem targetItem  e.Source as TreeViewItem              dynamic parent              if targetItem  null not dropped in the treeview                              isDragging  false                 return                          else if targetItem.Parent is TreeViewItem drag must start from either a treeviewitem...                              parent  targetItem.Parent as TreeViewItem                          else  ... or the root treeview                              parent  targetItem.Parent as TreeView                           Complete the dragdrop             must be same parent to successfully drop             ifsourceItem.Parent  targetItem.Parent                               var indexOfDropTarget  parent.Items.IndexOftargetItem                  parent.Items.RemoveAtparent.Items.IndexOfsourceItem                  parent.Items.InsertindexOfDropTarget, sourceItem                  sourceItem.IsSelected  true                                 isDragging  false      codepre  pThe rules of the treeview I need are that an item being dropped for reordering can only be reordered within the same parent.p  pThe code above works great, under the assumption that the treeviews children are all treeview items, each of which contains the data structure I am interested in.p  pWhen moving my new treeview class to the bigger project, I noticed that because the treeview is bound to a collection in the view model, e.Data is no longer a treeview item It is now the datastructure from the view model. e.Source is also no longer a treeview item, it is the entire treeview so I have no way of telling where I am dropping the item.p  pThe treeview is built automatically based off the datastructure in the view model. Each item has a Children property, and each item in the Children property can have their own children. My requirement is that the items within a Children property can be reordered, but a child could not be moved to the same collection its parent is stored in or one of its childrens collections.p  pMy question is this How do I get the TreeViewItem being dragged and the TreeViewItem being dropped upon I need to be able to see the parent of each and make sure they are the same.p  pAm I going about this the wrong way Should I be passing commands back to the view model insteadp  pThanksp

Negative 1926 pI know this question is probably very basic, but I am a beginner so I hope it is justified. I tried searching but could not really find anything basic on the topic. So... if I have a web app with users that are generating certain numbers over time and I want to create a pie chart and scatter plot of this data how would I do this I thought of making a bunch of jpgs with different charts at different values but that would be ridiculous so I am assuming there is an easier way to do this.

Negative 1926 pApologies in advance for the verbosity of this question. If you bear with me I think youll find its actually quite simple...just hard for me to explain given my limited Rails domain knowledge. p  pGiven this comment in a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsrailscommitaed135d3e261cbee153a35fcfbeb47e2e02b12e4 relnofollowan ActionController commit dated Aug 6ap  precode  Builtin HTTP verb semantics   Rails default renderer holds semantics for each HTTP verb. Depending on the  content type, verb and the resource status, it will behave differently.   Using Rails default renderer, a POST request for creating an object could  be written as     def create         user  User.newparams[user]          flash[notice]  User was successfully created. if user.save      respondwithuser        end   Which is exactly the same as     def create      user  User.newparams[user]       respondto do format        if user.save          flash[notice]  User was successfully created.          format.html  redirecttouser           format.xml  render xml gt user, status gt created, location gt user         else          format.html  render action gt new           format.xml  render xml gt user.errors, status gt unprocessableentity         end      end    end   The same happens for PUT and DELETE requests. codepre  pIve modified a very basic controller to use coderespondwithcode.

I think the default spec may possibly be written in an outofdate way. p  pFrom the commit comments codeSince the request is a POST, respondwith will check wether people resource have errors or not.

Negative 1926 pIn my Javascript and Flex applications, users often perform actions that I want other Javascript code on the page to listen for.  For example, if someone adds a friend.  I want my Javascript app to then call something like codetriggerEventaddedFriend, namecode.  Then any other code that was listening for the addedFriend event will get called along with the name.p  pIs there a builtin Javascript mechanism for handling events  Im ok with using jQuery for this too and I know jQuery makes extensive use of events.

Negative 1926 pOk, here goes.p  pBeing a Java developer Im still struggling with the memory management in ObjectiveC. I have all the basics covered, but once in a while I encounter a challenge.p  pWhat I want to do is something which in Java would look like thisp  precodeMyObject myObject  new MyObjectnew MyParameterObject codepre  pThe constructor of codeMyObjectcode class takes a parameter of type codeMyParameterObjectcode which I initiate onthefly.p  pIn ObjectiveC I tried to do this using following codep  precodeMyObject myObject  [[MyObject alloc] init[[MyParameterObject alloc] init]] codepre  pHowever, running the Build and Analyze tool this gives me a Potential leak of an object warning for the codeMyParametercode object which indeed occurs when I test it using Instruments. I do understand why this happens since I am taking ownership of the object with the codealloccode method and not relinquishing it, I just dont know the correct way of doing it. I tried usingp  precodeMyObject myObject  [[MyObject alloc] init[[[MyParameterObject alloc] init] autorelease]] codepre  pbut then the Analyze tool told me that Object sent autorelease too many times.p  pI could solve the issue by modifying the codeinitcode method of codeMyParameterObjectcode to say codereturn [self autorelease]code in stead of just codereturn selfcode. Analyze still warnes about a potential leak, but it doesnt actually occur. However I believe that this approach violates the convention for managing memory in ObjectiveC and I really want to do it the right way.p  pThanx in advance.p

I can see the name of the types involved and what happened add or remove but what Id really like is the Ids of the entities that are involved in the relationship change.p  pHere is what I currently have for tracking changes to many to many relationshipsp  precodevar changes  context.ObjectStateManager.GetObjectStateEntriesEntityState.Added  EntityState.Deleted  EntityState.Modified var auditTime  DateTime.Now  foreach var change in changes      if change.Entity  null ampamp change.Entity.GetType.EqualstypeofAuditTrail              continue           var detailsBuilder  new StringBuilder      if change.Entity  null amp change.State  EntityState.Added  change.State  EntityState.Deleted              detailsBuilder.AppendA link between entities          foreach var changedMember in change.EntitySet.ElementType.KeyMembers                      detailsBuilder.AppendFormat0, changedMember.Name             ifchange.EntitySet.ElementType.KeyMembers.IndexOfchangedMember lt change.EntitySet.ElementType.KeyMembers.Count 2                              detailsBuilder.Append,                           else if change.EntitySet.ElementType.KeyMembers.IndexOfchangedMember  change.EntitySet.ElementType.KeyMembers.Count  2                              detailsBuilder.Append and                                 detailsBuilder.AppendFormat was 0.ltbr gt, change.State       codepre  pHow can I get the details or even the actual entities involved in the relationship changep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter poking around on for a few more hours I have managed to find the information I need see attached image.

Negative 1926 pIve run into something very odd. The likelihood that its an error in my code is high, but I cant figure out why its happening.p  pFirst, heres an example page a hrefhttpdesignintellection.comquotes2011jan13designthinkingvisual relnofollowhttpdesignintellection.comquotes2011jan13designthinkingvisualap  pIf you notice the two nav tabs on the right of the page, when you scroll down they shrink in size and then become positionfixed as you scroll down the rest of the page. As you scroll back up they grow to their original size and go back to nonfixed positioning. If youre wondering why Im shrinking them Im eventually going to replace the text with an icon.p  pIve posted the code JS amp CSS to accomplish this effect below. I know it can be written better, but the main thing Im trying to discern is if Javascript is able to capture every specific scroll position. I say that because if you scroll slowly then the tabs behave as theyre supposed to, you can go up and down as much as you like. However if you scroll at a normal to fast speed then the size, margins and positioning fall apart and you get very strange behavior.p  pOn some level I feel like Im taking crazy pills, usually I would try to look for bugs, etc. but it seems so strange to me that it works when you scroll slowly and doesnt when you scroll fast.p  pjQueryp  precode    function      window.scrollfunction          var scroll  window.scrollTop          if scroll gt 80              theportfoliolink.csswidth2px, margintop0             theportfoliolink.addClasspagelinkportfoliostay             theserviceslink.cssmargintop108px                   if scroll gt 22 ampamp scroll lt 80              theportfoliolink.csswidth60px, margintop65px             theportfoliolink.removeClasspagelinkportfoliostay              var newwidth  60  22  scroll             var existingmargin  65             var newmarginservices  65  60  newwidth              if existingmargin lt 65                  var newmargin  65  67  newwidth                 var margintop  newmargin                          else                  var margintop  65                           theportfoliolink.csswidthnewwidthpx, margintopmargintoppx             theserviceslink.cssmargintopnewmarginservicespx                   if scroll gt 80 ampamp scroll lt 138              theserviceslink.csswidth60px, margintop108px             theserviceslink.removeClasspagelinkservicesstay              var newserviceswidth  60  80  scroll             var existingservicesmargin  theserviceslink.cssmargintop.replacepx,              var marginservicestop  108  60  newserviceswidth              theserviceslink.csswidthnewserviceswidthpx, margintopmarginservicestoppx                   if scroll gt 138              theserviceslink.csswidth2px, margintop0             theserviceslink.addClasspagelinkservicesstay                codepre  pCSS relevant code onlyp  precode.mainnav  positionabsolute left1102px top55px  .mainnavlink  displayblock width60px height22px margin65px 0 0 36px   .pagelinkportfoliostay  width2px margintop0 positionfixed left1102px top40px overflowhidden  .pagelinkservicesstay  width2px margintop0 positionfixed left1102px top83px overflowhidden  codepre  pAny ideas, etc. are much appreciated.p  pThanks Davidp
Negative 1926 pIm new to cucumber and currently stuck trying to organizestructure some featuresscenarios. The behavior Im trying to capture is that of users, guests and admins using my website. The website is basically for creating private and public todo lists.p  pAnd these are the specific scenarios I want to testp  ul liRegistered users can view their private todo lists but not someone elses private todo listli liGuests anonymous users can only view public todo listsli liAdmins can view all listsli liManaging todo listsli ul  pRight now Im going with something like thisp  precodeFeature Managing Todo lists   In order to be more productive   As a user of the site   I want to be able to manage todo lists  Background   Given a user named useroneemail.com with password secretone   Given a user named usertwoemail.com with password secrettwo   Given an admin named adminemail.com with password admin  Scenario useroneemail.com can view his own private todo lists Scenario useroneemail.com can not view usertwoemail.com private todo lists Scenario adminemail.com can view useroneemail.com and usertwoemail.com private todo lists Scenario useroneemail.com can create private todo lists Scenario useroneemail.com can delete todo lists they own Scenario adminemail.com can delete useroneemail todo list Scenario guests can view all public todo lists codepre  pThe problem Im running into is the setup for each scenario. For example, in the first scenario I have to assume codeuseroneemail.comcode is logged in. In the first codeadminemail.comcode scenario I have to assume the admin is logged in.

Negative 1926 pHi I am using EF 4 self tracking entities. I have three tables Questionnaire, Section and Page as followsp  precodeQuestionnaire Id Title WhenClosedShowPageId  Section Id QuestionnaireId  Page Id SectionId codepre  pSo that in the EF model Questionnaire has Sections and Section has Pages.  WhenClosedShowPageId is a nullable int that references the page to show when the questionnaire is closed.  All references have associations to maintain referential integrity.p  pThe problem comes when I mark all entities as deleted and attempt to save.  If WhenClosedShowPageId was null when I retrieved the data, then the delete works fine.  If WhenClosedShowPageId is set to a value then EF cannot work out the order in which to delete.  This is understandable.  However if I set WhenClosedShowPageId to null, mark the entities as deleted and save, the same thing happens. I would have expected EF to generate an update statement first to set WhenClosedShowPageId to null on the database and then for it to delete the entities.p  pThe only way I can see to get around the issue is to do two independent saves myself, the first to set WhenClosedShowPageId to null and the second to delete the entities.  This is a heavily layered app though and I dont want to have to create a special case just for this.p  pIs there any way around thisp  pDarrenp

Negative 1926 pI have an existing library written in C which wraps a much lowerlevel TCPIP API and exposes messages coming down the wire from a server proprietary binary protocol as .NET events. I also provide method calls on an object which handles the complexities of marshalling convenient .NET types like System.DateTime down to the binary encodings and fixedlength structures that the API requires for outgoing messages to the server. There are a fair number of existing applications both internally and used by third parties built on top of this .NET library.p  pRecently, weve been approached by someone who doesnt want to do all the legwork of abstracting the TCPIP themselves, but their environment is strictly nonWindows I assume nix, but Im not 100 sure, and theyve intimated that their ideal would be something callable from Java.p  pWhats the best way to support their requirements, without me having top  ol liPort the code to Java now including an unmanaged DLL that we currently PInvoke into for decompressionli liHave to maintain two separate codebases going forwards i.e. making the same bugfixes and feature enhancements twiceli ol  pOne thing Ive considered is to rewrite most of the core TCPIP functionality once into something more crossplatform C  C and then change my .NET library to be a thin layer on top of this PInvoke, and then write a similarly thin Java layer on top of it too JNI.p  pProsp  ul liI mostly spend my time writing things only once.li ul  pConsp  ul liMost of the code would now be unmanaged  not the end of the world, but not ideal from a productivity point of view for me.li liLonger development time cant port C sockets code to C  C as quickly as just porting to Java [How true is this]li liAt this point, the underlying API is mostly wrapped and the library is very stable, so theres probably not a lot of new development  it might not be that bad to just port the current code to Java and then have to make occasional bugfixes or expose new fields twice in the future.li liPotential instability for my existing client applications while the version theyre running on changes drastically underneath them. Off the top of my head I can think of 3264 bit issues, endianness issues, and general bugs that may crop up during the port, etc.li ul  pAnother option Ive briefly considered is somehow rigging Mono up to Java, so that I can leverage all of the existing C code I already have. Im not too clued up though on how smooth the developer experience will be for the Java developers who have to consume it though. Im pretty sure that most of the code should run without trouble under Mono bar the decompression PInvoke which should probably just be ported to C anyway.p  pId ideally not like to add another layer of TCPIP, pipes, etc. between my code and the client Java app if I can help it so WCF to Javaside WSDeathStar is probably out. Ive never done any serious development with Java, but I take some pride in the fact that the library is currently a piece of cake for a thirdparty developer to integrate into his application as long as hes running .NET of course , and Id like to be able to keep that same easeofuse for any Java developers who want the same experience.p  pSo if anyone has opinions on the 3 options Ive proposed port to Java amp maintain twice, port to C and write thin language bindings for .NET and Java or, try and integrate Java and Mono, or any other suggestions Id love to hear them.p  pThanksp  pEdit After speaking directly with the developer at the client i.e. removal of broken telephone AKA Sales Department the requirements have changed enough that this question no longer applies very well to my immediate situation. However, Ill leave the question open in the hopes that we can generate some more good suggestions.p  pIn my particular case, the client actually runs Windows machines in addition to Solaris who doesnt these days and is happy for us to write an application Windows Service on top of the library and provide a much more simplified and smaller TCPIP API for them to code against. We will translate their simple messages into the format that the downstream system understands, and translate incoming responses back for them to consume, so that they can continue to interface with this downstream system via their Java application.p  pGetting back to the original scenario after thinking about this for a couple of weeks, I do have a few more commentsp  ul lipA portable Cbased library with different language bindings on top would probably be the way to go if you knew up front that youd need to support multiple languages  platforms.pli lipOn nix, can a single process host both a Java runtime and a Mono runtime simultaneously I know in earlier versions of .NET you couldnt have two different .NET runtimes in the same process, but I believe theyve fixed this with .NET 4 If this is possible, how would one communicate between the two Ideally youd want something as simple as a static method call and a delegate to raise responses with.pli lipIf theres no easy direct interface support between Java amp Mono methods amp delegates, etc., one might consider using something like ZeroMQ with Protocol Buffers or Apache Thrift as the message format. This would work inprocess, interprocess and over the network because of ZeroMQs support for different transports.pli ul

Negative 1926 pIm looking to optimizeupgrade our web application from the traditional PHPMySQL, to a more efficient technology. Ive been researching node.js, socket.io and CouchDB, which look promising, but am looking for recommendations and some help in choosing the best technologies for what we want.p  pstrongSo, to outline the what is currently done...strongp  pWe have devices that capture data and sends it to an FTP server via .txt file. A PHP script runs every 5 minutes, scanning the FTP for .txt files that the devices send. The contents of the files are inserted into a MySQL database, and the .txt file deleted. Another PHP script that runs every 15 minutes will collate data from the database eg, sum values for last hour and produce an XML document, which are read by Flash dials.p  pObviously, there are plenty of issues here, and it is far from a realtime solution, which is what we are aiming for. The solution wed like is, that somehow, it could detect when the txt file is uploaded to the FTP, and only process the data then rather than having a set interval that runs. The data would still need to be added to the database, and be read by the frontend as soon as it is added to the database. Flash would be removed entirely, as its a little...ick...p  pWith exciting new technologies like node.js and Web Sockets socket.io, im sure we could improve this process greatly Im aware of Ajax being able to do something like this, but hear it has rather high overheads compared to Web Sockets. Im also a little hazy with how a database would work with node.js, not to mention the best option for what were after...p  pThanksp

Negative 1926 pIve found a few questions on this topic and ive tried the solutions, but I cant seem to get it right.  I have a TableLayout as the first child in a RelativeLayout and a SlidingDrawer as the second child.  The slide works fine, but clicking on the drawer when its open goes through to the items under the drawer.  p  pIve tried adding an ontouch listener with a return true to the opening of the slider, but all that seems to do is not allow me to open the drawer.  Also, anything that would be covered by the drawer if it was open, is unclickable.  p  pIf I change the return true to a p  pif slidingDrawer.isOpened     return true else     return falsep  pthis gives me a couple of problems.  While the drawer opens and i cannot click through to the lower layer, I also cannot click anything on the drawer or click the handle to close the drawer.p  pIm not sure what Im missing.  Id appreciate any help.p

Negative 1926 pHey all, I was able to do this via a SELECT CASE statement, however Im always trying to improve my code writing and was wondering if there was a better approach.  Heres the scenariop  pEach document has x custom fields on it. Theres y number of documents However theres only 21 distinct custom fields, but they can obviously have n different combinations of them depending on the form.p  pSo heres what I did, I created an object called CustomFields like sop  precode Private Class CustomFields     Public agentaddress As String     Public agentattorney As String     Public agentcity As String     Public agentname As String     Public agentnumber As String     Public agentstate As String     Public agentzip As String     ... more fields here .... End Class codepre  pThen I went ahead and assigned the values I get from the user to each of those fields like sop  precodeSet All of Our Custom Fields Accordingly         Dim pcc As New CustomFields         pcc.agentaddress  agent.address1         pcc.agentattorney  cplinfo.attorneyname         pcc.agentcity  agent.city         pcc.agentname  agent.agencyName         pcc.agentnumber  agent.agentNumber         pcc.agentstate  agent.state         pcc.agentzip  agent.zip ....other values set to fields etc. codepre  pNow the idea is based upon what combo of fields come back based upon the document, we need to assign the value which matches up with that custom fields value.  So if the form only needed agentaddress and agentcityp  precodeNow Lets Loop Through the Custom Fields for This Document         For Each cf As vCustomField In cc             Dim customs As New tblCustomValue              Select Case cf.fieldname                 Case agentaddress                     customs.customfieldid  cf.customfieldid                     customs.icsid  cpl.icsID                     customs.value  pcc.additionalinfo                 Case agentcity                     customs.customfieldid  cf.customfieldid                     customs.icsid  cpl.icsID                     customs.value  pcc.additionalinfo End Select              db.tblCustomValues.InsertOnSubmitcustoms             db.SubmitChanges codepre  pThis works, however we may end up having 100s of fields in the future so there a way to somehow EVAL yes I know that doesnt exist in vb.net the cf.fieldname and find its corresponding value in the CustomFields objectp  pJust trying to write more efficient code and looking for some brainstorming here.  Hopefully my code and description makes sense.  If it doesnt let me know and Ill go hit my head up against the wall and try writing it again.p

Negative 1926 plong story short, was just a dumb assumption by me, I was sure a column was a datetime and it wasnt  so dont expect to find anything interesting in this question, leaving it here so that dems gets his rightfully accepted answerp  pI wrote a simple query like thisp  precodeSELECT ID, MINDateMadeActive AS DateMadeActive FROM RecordStateField WHERE RecordStatusID in 2, 3 GROUP BY ID codepre  pWhere DateMadeActive is a datetime column. This returned what I expectedp  precodeID  DateMadeActive 1   20062011 161504 2   20062011 161428 codepre  pNow I inserted this into a new table, but inserting the result of MINDateMadeActive into a datetime column of another table gave me this errorp  precodeMsg 8115, Level 16, State 2, Line 1 Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type datetime. codepre  pSo to test this I change my select to thisp  precodeSELECT ID, CASTMinDateMadeActive as datetime AS DateMadeActive FROM RecordStateField WHERE RecordStatusID in 2, 3 GROUP BY ID codepre  pSame exception. I can write it like this and make it workp  precodeSELECT ID, CONVERTdatetime, MinDateMadeActive, 103 AS DateMadeActive FROM RecordStateField WHERE RecordStatusID in 2, 3 GROUP BY ID codepre  pSo I can get it working, but this confuses me. The a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms17991628vSQL.9029.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa for MINexpression says the return type should be the same as expression, but what seems to be happening is that MINdatetime is returning nvarchar255. I can confirm this by running thisp  precodeSELECT ID, MinDateMadeActive AS DateMadeActive INTO TestTable FROM RecordStateField WHERE RecordStatusID in 2, 3 GROUP BY ID codepre  pAnd I can see that the DateMadeActive column is of type nvarchar255.

Negative 1926 pFirst off, I am a complete noob, so please be gentle when explaining.  I have a program that loads a webpage UIWebview on the first view controller.

Negative 1926 pI have a rails 3jquery application where a user comes across a new person form. In the form, one of the things he can do is to add addresses as he is constructing the person.

Negative 1926 pI have been playing with Gallery View for sometime now and I have the basic stuff up and running. However, I have a problem with scrolling. I have tried to search in google and did not get a simple solution to this problem. I am loading images using a Base Adapter and once done, I need to move to a particular positionread auto scroll. The problem that I am facing is that, lets say I have 50 images loaded in the gallery and I want to move to the 30th position, I would just need to call gallery.setSelection30 and I should be done. This works only when called from a button click. However, I want the same to be done on the activity load itself. Once I bind the the BaseAdapter with the gallery, I am not able to find out when exactly the binding is completed. I would appreciate any help on this. This is how I am binding the adapter. p  precode        gallery  Gallery findViewByIdR.id.wpGallery     ImageAdapter imgAdapter  new ImageAdapterthis     gallery.setAdapterimgAdapter      codepre  pI want to move to the given position and also trigger the onClickEvent once it has moved to that position. p

Negative 1926 pSo I am troubleshooting some performance problems on a legacy application, and I have uncovered a pretty specific problem there may be others.p  pEssentially, the application is using an object relational mapper to fetch data, but it is doing so in a very inefficientincorrect way.  In effect, it is performing a series of entity graph fetches to fill a datagrid in the UI, and on databinding the grid it is ASP.Net Webforms it is doing additional fetches, which lead to other fetches, etc.p  pThe net effect of this is that many, many tiny queries are being performed.  Using SQL Profiler shows that a certain page performs over 10,000 queries to fill a single grid.  No query takes over 10ms to complete, and most of them register as 0ms in Profiler.  Each query will use and release one connection, and the series of queries would be singlethreaded per http request.p  pI am very familiar with the ORM, and know exactly how to fix the problem.p  pMy question is what is the exact effect of having many, many small queries being executed in an application  In what ways does itcan it stress the different components of the systemp  pFor example, what is the effect on the webservers CPU and memory  Would it flood the connection pool and cause blocking  What would be the impact on the database servers memory, CPU and IOp  pI am looking for relatively general answers, mainly because I want to start monitoring the areas that are likely to be the most affected I need to measure  fix  remeasure.

Negative 1926 pIm not really into typesafety as a concept but many consider it important for well written code and think that for some of the most important factors such as for code to scale well, be reusable, be robust etc... it needs to be type safe.p  pLanguages like C take typesafety seriously, they are statically typed and generics in C are considerably more typesafe than C templates. Even codeArrayListcode which is considered not as typesafe as codeListltgtcode being that it is a codeListltobjectgtcode is much more typesafe than for example a codeListltdynamicgtcode, which I think should be possible but is certainly obscure.p  pHowever I wonder, again using C as an example why there is still codenullcode. I like and approve of codenullcode but its not in keeping with the type safety of the rest of the language.p  pPerhaps in some respects null improves performance preventing everything needing to be constructed by default but it also requires extra timeconsuming runtime checking for the computer to throw null exceptions and the such.p  precodeString s  null int n  s.Length  error like a type error, even if technically it isnt codepre

I would suspect in normal circumstances emails longer than 40 or 50 characters would be pretty rare.p  pBut as data such as email addresses vary in length should they always be stored as a nvarchar so as to eliminate redundant spacep  pIf using nvarchar for an email column. In the event of an email address being changed, if the new email is longer than the previous email will this cause many page splits and therefor much of a performance costp  pWould you ever consider using nchar40 for an email address and compromising loss of storage space in return for no page split performance costsp  pOr would using nchar40 significantly increase database size thereby cause other performance hits on query speedp  pWould only use nchar when you know the size of data to fill the column be a reasonable rule to followp

But now, with twitter, Ive found this kind of categorization very difficult. p  ol lipDo I need to have a training set and if the answer to this question is positive, dont you think twitter is so temporal so if I have that set, my performance on future topics will be very poorpli lipI was thinking in getting a dictionary  mainly adjectives and cross my tweets with it and obtain a termdocument matrix but I have no class assigned to any twitter.

Negative 1926 pIm starting to develop a ASP NET MVC 3 application and I have sought to follow some good DDD pratices. I have the following situation which would like an opinion. One of the System features is the creation of activities which one or more users of the system will participate, a meeting for example. Any user with a certain access profile can create new activities, perhaps only the user who create an activity can change her. The question is Whats the correct place to insert this rulep  p In every setter of Activity entity Seems break the DRY.p  p In the repository at the moment of saving the changes In this case , what would be the correct moment to pass the user permissions  One more parameter to this method In the class constructorIn my model, the repositories are interfaces, if I adopt this option,  the dependency would be explicit only in the infrastructure layer where the repositories are implementedp  p Controller It seems to collaborate with an anemic model.p  pBy the way, questions abound...

Negative 1926 pDoes the difference between Mealy and Moore state machines have any real significance when it comes to a C implementation  What would that difference normally be   p  pA long time ago, it was much easier for me to understand MealyMoore advantagesdisadvantages when it comes to RTL.  The whole output depending on the current stateoutput depending on the current statecurrent input difference made sense, as did the fact that Mealys could be made with 1 less state in some cases also made sense.  Associating timing diagrams with each FSM implementation also made the difference between them more clear.   p  pSay Im making a state machine in C.  In one case a LUT depends on statecurrent inputs Mealy and in the Moore the LUT just looks up the current state and returns the next.  In either the output happens after the return from the LUT I think, though I could be wrong.  I havent thought of a clear way that a Mealy has an advantage when coded in C.  Topics like code readability, speed, code density, design ease, may all be relevant topics  from my perspective the two models seem almost the same.   p  pMaybe this difference is just a topic for academics  and in practice in C implementations the difference is negligible.  If you know the key ways a C state machine implementation would differ between Mealy and Moore, and if there are real advantages that are also significant Id be curious to know.  Id like to emphasize  Im not asking about RTL implementations.   p  pI did see one other MealyMoore post here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4009283mealyvsmooreMealy vs. Mooreap  pBut this isnt really the level of explanation I am looking for.  p
Negative 1926 pWe have a REST API, part of which displays a users catalog. A catalog is a list of products along with some overall catalog metadata e.g. amount of money left.p  pWe are at the stage of trying to add this metadata to catalog responses, but got stuck on our database design. The backing store is Amazons DynamoDB, which is just a keyvalue store. Notably it supports something like a primary key hash and secondary key range.p  pCurrently our database entries look likep  precode customerId xxx, productId yyyy, productPrice zzz  codepre  pWe can moreorless directly translate these into catalog entries, which yields a response ofp  precode products [ id yyyy, price zzz ]  codepre  pBut we want a response with metadata now, likep  precode metadata  moneyLeft 5 , products [ id yyyy, price zzz ]  codepre  pThe question is, stronghow do we store the metadata in our databasestrongp  hr  pstrongApproach 1 Separate Databasesstrongp  pCreate a separate metadata table, with primary key codecustomerIdcode, and columns for all metadata properties. Then query both tables two HTTP requests to DynamoDB, and assemble the results.p  pstrongApproach 2 Query Orientedstrongp  pRepurpose the current table to be specifically designed for this catalogdisplaying query. It will have two types of rows, something likep  precode customerId xxx, productId yyyy, productPrice zzz, type product   customerId xxx, moneyLeft 5, type metadata  codepre  palthough a bit more robust. Then we could do a query to select all rows from the table with codecustomerId  xxxcode, and in our server code transform them into the desired response by switching on the codetypecode property.p  hr  pIm leaning toward approach 2, because it seems like approach 1 is still stuck in relationalDB thinking, and it would involve two DB calls  HTTP requests. But its just so weird, Im not sure thats a good idea. Maybe theres a third approach I imagine the real answer is you should use a document database, but were pretty committed to DynamoDB by this point .p

Negative 1926 pI am having trouble packaging an application with both Swing and JavaFX components into a JAR file. Running it from Eclipse is fine.

Negative 1926 pI have been reading Qt documentation and playing around with the qobject tree. I was wondering if there is a way to remove widgets from inside the tree that would delete them from memory. p  pWhen embedding qwidgetsqobjects in each other and creating the tree, removing a widget with removeWidget from the qlayouts would remove them visually in the gui however the object still remains attached to the parent qobject objectparent is not 0, it will only be deleted once its parent is deleted such as going out of scope. I can only see that an qwidget can be destroyed only once the application terminates where the top widget wills everything underneath it or if the object goes out of scope. p  pFor example, say have a main window that has 2 stages the first one has about 100 objects embedded from one parent and the other has 200. The application starts at stage 1 and moves to stage 2 where it will never go back to stage 1. If I wanted this to be somewhat efficient, I would try to kill all the objects in stage 1 100 objects but because they are attached to the root node of the main window, it cannot be destroyed even using removeWidget.p  pI also tried to receive the pointer of a widget that was created without new operator and if I delete that object, the application would crash because it would call the destructor twice.p  pMy question is, is there a way to remove a node in the qobject tree where that node is not deleted because it is out of scope or when the application terminatesp  pSorry if this does not make that much sense. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pSorry if I have given the wrong idea. My question is to remove a node from memory before the application terminates or before the object goes out of scope.

Negative 1926 pI know that .NET Remoting has been replaced by WCF, but this is more of an academic question than anything else.p  pSuppose that you have a remotable class that is defined as followsp  precodepublic class MyObject  MarshalByRefObject   codepre  pAnd suppose that you have client code that instantiates a remotable object of type MyObject but does not use it as a remotable objectp  precodepublic static void MainString[] args     MyObject mo  new MyObject  codepre  pNow, suppose that I want to programmatically tell the type of mo.

However, when I place a breakpoint and hit F5, Visual Studio tells me that the type of mo is actually MyObject System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.TransparentProxyp  pWhat I want to know is how to tell, programmatically, that the underlying type of mo is TransparentProxy.p
Negative 1926 pI am trying to use a WPF combobox with a databinding on its codeSelecteItemcode property. When the user chooses a new selection, the codeSelectedItemcode changes, but my model is not updated properly, and the codeSelectionBoxItemcode item displayed in the combobox is not changed. p  pMore specifically, I have the following two elementsp  precodeltListView NamelvNodes ItemsSourceBinding PathNodes SelectedItemBinding PathCurrentNode, ModeTwoWaygt                     ltListView.ItemTemplategt                         ltDataTemplategt                             ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                                 ltTextBlock TextBinding PathNamegt                             ltStackPanelgt                         ltDataTemplategt                     ltListView.ItemTemplategt                 ltListViewgt codepre  pThis listview works as expected. The combobox that is having problems is defined like sop  precodeltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding PathCameraViews SelectedItemBinding PathCurrentNode.NodeInfo.Camera1, ConverterStaticResource EnsureBlank, ModeTwoWay NamecomboBoxTopCam SelectionChangedcomboBoxTopCamSelectionChangedgt                                 ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt                                     ltDataTemplategt                                         ltTextBlock TextBinding PathNamegt                                     ltDataTemplategt                                 ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt                             ltComboBoxgt codepre  pSo when the user selects a node from the ListView above, the ComboBox updates to display the camera that node is using. p  pNow the strange behavior. If the user clicks on a new item on the combo box, I can stop with the debugger and examine the codeSelecteItemcode property. This is always set properly, however the codeCurrentNode.NodeInfo.Camera1code property is not changed, and the string displayed in the SelectionBox is unchanged. p  pIt gets even stranger, however. If the user switches the node using the ListView defined earlier AFTER making such a selection on the ComboBox, the ComboBox again doesnt display the new value, but the codeSelectedItemcode is correct. If the user then changes the selected item in the ListView AGAIN, then it starts displaying the correct value, and is fine until the user messes with the combo box again. p  pNow I said earlier that my model is not being updated when the ComboBox changes, so I made an event handler to update the model for me you can see this in the definition of the ComboBox. This is defined as possiblep  precodeprivate void comboBoxTopCamSelectionChangedobject sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e              CameraViewInfo selCam  comboBoxTopCam.SelectedItem as CameraViewInfo         if selCam  null                      OTNode selNode  lvNodes.SelectedItem as OTNode              if selCam.Name  None                 selNode.NodeInfo.Camera1  new CameraViewInfo             else                 selNode.NodeInfo.Camera1  selCam  lt This line affects the behavior               codepre  pWhen I comment out the marked line in the above listing, the ComboBox displays the correct item in the SelectionBox, but doesnt update my model e.g. codeCurrentNode.NodeInfo.Camera1code is not changed. This happens when I use codelvNodes.SelectedItemcode OR when I use codeCurrentCameracode the databound property, it makes no difference which.p  pI know this is a pretty weird problem, and I did the best I could explaining it, if anyone wants more information debug output from databindings, code for the converter, information about equality operators etc I am happy to provide it, I would event be willing to upload a video showing the odd behavior if necessary, since its a little hard to make sense of from text alone.p  pUpdatep  h3Code for Converterh3  precodepublic class EnsureBlankConterter

I am changing the numbers and some small details, because most of the class is as stumped as I.p  pRequirements Create 3 processes, the first one will increment a shared memory variable totalvalue from 1 to 10000, the second from 10000 to 12000, the third from 12000 to 14000p  pThe process functions are labeled such process1, process2, process3 and the internals of those functions are as followsp  precodeprocess1     int k  0    while k lt 10000           k       totalgtvalue  totalgtvalue  1        printfFrom process 1  dn, totalgtvalue  codepre  pThe second would be k lt 2000 because it only needs to increment the shared value 2000 more and etc.p  pThe main portion of the program isp  precodemain     int shmid    int pid1    int pid2    int pid3    int ID    int status    char shmadd  char 0      Create and connect to a shared memory segmentt     if shmid  shmgetSHMKEY, sizeof int, IPCCREAT  0666 lt 0           perrorshmget       exit1         if total  sharedmem shmatshmid, shmadd, 0  sharedmem 1           perrorshmat       exit0         totalgtvalue  0     if pid1  fork  0       process1     if pid1  0 ampamp pid2  fork  0       process2     if pid1  0 ampamp pid2  0 ampamp pid3  fork  0       process3     if pid1  0 ampamp pid2  0 ampamp pid3  0           if shmctlshmid, IPCRMID, struct shmidds 0  1                 perrorshmctl          exit1              printftt  End of Program.n      codepre  pWhat I need is for the first process to finish, before the 2nd starts. I tried inserting a waitampstatus after the process1 or 2 or 3 calls and am at a loss. Any pointers no pun intended  there is more to implement, but I believe once I have this part I can handle the rest on my own. I have been intentionally vague in some regards, but I would like to finish this project and more importantly understand it and there are others who want a free lunch. I will provide anything else in the code that is required.

Negative 1926 pemstrongEditstrong The initial question was wrong, so some of the content might be a bit unrelated. But might give you a better impression of the way Im doing stuff.emp  pIve got a pretty strange problem with a codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode. First Ill describe the current situation of my app. Ive got multiple codeAlbumcode and codePhotocode entities, which are both subclasses of an abstract class codeAbstractItemcode.p  pIn my codeAlbumViewControllercode Im using to a codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to get all the codeAbstractItemcodes with the current codesuperAlbumcode. Like thisp  precode NSFetchedResultsController fetchedResultsController      if fetchedResultsController           NSFetchRequest request  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]          [request setEntity[NSEntityDescription entityForNameAbstractItem                                        inManagedObjectContextmanagedObjectContext]]          [request setSortDescriptors[          [NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKeytype ascendingYES],          [NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKeyname ascendingYES],          [NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKeycreationDate ascendingYES]         ]]          NSPredicate predicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatsuperAlbum  , self.parentAlbum]         [request setPredicatepredicate]          NSFetchedResultsController newController  [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequestrequest                                                                                         managedObjectContextmanagedObjectContext                                                                                           sectionNameKeyPathtype                                                                                                    cacheNamenil]          newController.delegate  self          self.fetchedResultsController  newController           return fetchedResultsController  codepre  pWhen I select an codeAlbumcode, another instance of codeAlbumViewControllercode is initiated and pushed on my navigation controller. In that case codeparentAlbumcode is set to the selected object.p  pNow when I add a new codeAlbumcode with the following code, the error occurs.p  precodeAlbum album  Album [Album itemInManagedObjectContextself.managedObjectContext] album.name  Test album album.superAlbum  self.parentAlbum  NSError error BOOL success  [self.managedObjectContext saveamperror]  if success      NSLogError , error  codepre  pstrikeThe method codecontrollerdidChangeObjectatIndexPathforChangeTypenewIndexPathcode gets called for with the type codeNSFetchedResultsChangeUpdatecode for the codeparentAlbumcode object. That ones isnt present in the current codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode. So it fails when it tries to update it in the collection view.p  pHow is it possible that an object that isnt in the current codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode is used for a notification And how can I fix this issuestrikep  pstrongEditstrongbr After posting the question, I realized that it actually isnt the codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode notifying about the wrong object. But it notifies about an object in the previous parent collection view, but it does that to its own collection view controller.p  pBut that might be just the problem The collection view controller receives a notification while it isnt visible, looks like it cant handle that at this moment. I handle the notification like thisp  precode voidcontrollerNSFetchedResultsController controller didChangeObjectidanObject atIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath forChangeTypeNSFetchedResultsChangeTypetype newIndexPathNSIndexPath newIndexPath          switch type          case NSFetchedResultsChangeUpdate             [self.collectionView reloadItemsAtIndexPaths[indexPath]]             break       codepre  pI was pretty sure it worked fine before. After iterating over the changes made since last commit, I get it to work again. It did work again after I removed the codeUICollectionViewcode header the supplementary view.p  pSo My codeUICollectionViewcode cant update items when it has an header and its not currently visible. That was a tough one to discover, but how can this be fixed Think its a really strange issue.p  pThe errors I getp  precode20121004 115421.148 PhotoLibrary[9195c07] [NSISObjectiveLinearExpression coefficientForVariable] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x968bae0 20121004 115421.151 PhotoLibrary[9195c07] CoreData error Serious application error.

Negative 1926 pIt may be a very basic low level architecture questions. I am trying to get my head around it. Please correct if my understanding is wrong, as well. p  pWord  64 bit, 32 bit, etc. This is a number of bits computer can read at a time. p  pQuestions p  p1. Would this mean, we can send, 4 numbers of a 8 bitsbyte length each for 32 bit Or combination of 8 bit byte, 32 bit 4 bytes, etc numbers at one timep  p2. If we need to send only 8 bit number, then how does it form a word Only first byte is filled and rest all bytes are padded with 0s or last byte gets filled while rest of the bytes are padded with 0s Or I saw somewhere like first byte has information as to how the rest of the bytes are filled. Does that apply here For example, UTF8. Here, ASCII is 1 byte, and some other chars take up to 4 bytes. So when we send one char, we send all 4 bytes together, but fill the bytes as required for the char and rest of the bytes 0s p  p3. Now to represent 8 digit number, we would need 27 bits remember famous question, sorting 1 million 8 digit number with just 1 MB RAM. Can we exactly use 27 bits, which is 32 bits 4 bytes   5 bits and use those 5 digits for something elsep  pAppreciate your answersp

Negative 1926 pI am using localhost to develop a website.  Recently i was surprised that a script i was using was fully executed and then redirected using headerLocationhttp.... with this being at the bottom.  I was surprised because i had read the header needed to be at the top of the page before any output was called.p  pTo see if there was a difference i then placed the header at the top of script.  I was redirect fine but the script was not fully executed.  I read up at httpstackoverflow.comquestions7213646phpheaderlocationimmediately that i may need ignoreuserabort and with phpfpm its fastcgifinishrequest to guarantee entire script execution.p  pI am novel programmer and so if somebody could go into the how to do this that would be great, if it really is a necessity.  However my first and main question is whether this is necessary as the script was working to start with.  In order words, is this just an oddity with localhost, and thus i will need to go the more complicated route when i host the website properlyp

I need to see the onthefly compilation error because there is clearly no actual problem with the dynamicallygenerated code.p  pSo how can I view the actual errorp  pI should note besides the Colorstring constructor, implicit conversion from string to Color also throws the CompiledAssembly exception when I try to use that in the dynamicallycompiled code. I suspect a connection there, especially since I have noticed in the past that the C compiler tends to invoke that implicit stringtoColor conversion sometimes for no reason at all faulty optimization. But regardless of that I am not aware of any limitations of dynamic compilation related to implicit conversion.p  pUnless someone instantly knows why my string constructor and string implicit conversion fail when dynamically compiled, I am hoping that someone can give me easy directions to view the actual dynamic compiler error, because the unable to load file or assembly isnt helping.p  pThanks so muchp

All of that amounts to a join operation on ids and an inversion of one of the original maps. Since Id, FullName and Name are always 111 it seemed to me that there should be some way to simplify this. I also discovered that the first two maps are never used again, and I find that the above code is a bit hard to read. So Im considering replacing it with something like this that to me reads much cleaner p  precodeTableltString, String, Stringgt relations  HashBasedTable.create  addRelationships1dataSource1, relations addRelationships2dataSource2, relations  MapltString,Stringgt idByName  relations.columnhasId MapltString,Stringgt nameByFullName  relations.columnhasName relations  null  not used hereafter codepre  pIn addRelationships1 I dop  precoderelations.putid, hasFullName, fullname codepre  pAnd in addRelationships2 where my query yields values for codeidcode and codenamecode I dop  precoderelations.putrelations.removeid,hasFullName, hasName, name relations.putname, hasId, id codepre  pSo my questions are thesep  ol liIs there a lurking inefficiency in what I have done either via processor or memory, or GC load I dont think so, but Im not that familiar with the efficiency of Table.

On the other hand, the top level now pretty clearly says, gather data from two sources and make these two maps from it. I also like the fact that it doesnt leave  you wondering ifwhere the other two maps are being used or not.li liDo you have an even better, cleaner, faster, simpler way to do it than either of the aboveli ol  pPlease Lets not have the optimize earlylate discussion here.

Im using the HttpURLConnection class for Http Requests and I just run a thread synchronized and wait for each request. Ive tried concurrently running the requests and I run into some issues.

Negative 1926 pAn assignment that Ive just now completed requires me to create a set of scripts that can configure random Ubuntu machines as nodes in an MPI computing cluster. This has all been done and the nodes can communicate with one another properly. However, I would now like to demonstrate the efficiency of said MPI cluster by throwing a parallel program at it. Im just looking for a straight brute force calculation that can divide up work among the number of processes nodes available if one node takes 10 seconds to run the program, 4 nodes should only take about 2.5.p  pWith that in mind I looked for a prime calculation programs written in C. For any purists, the program is not actually part of my assignment as the course Im taking is purely systems management. I just need anything that will show that my cluster is working. I have some programming experience but little in C and none with MPI. Ive found a hrefhttppeople.sc.fsu.edujburkardtcsrcprimempiprimempi.html relnofollowquitea a a hrefhttpscomputing.llnl.govtutorialsmpisamplesCmpiprime.c relnofollowfewa sample programs but none of those seem to actually run in parallel. They do distribute all the steps among my nodes so if one node has a faster processor the overall time will go down, but adding additional nodes does nothing to speed up the calculation.p  pAm I doing something wrong Are the programs that Ive found simply not parallel Do I need to learn C programming for MPI to write my own program Are there any other parallel MPI programs that I can use to demonstrate my cluster at workp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThanks to the answers below Ive managed to get several MPI scripts working, among which the sum of the first N natural numbers which isnt very useful as it runs into data type limits, the counting and generating of prime numbers  and the Monte Carlo calculation of Pi. Interestingly only the prime number programs realise a sometimes dramatic performance gain with multiple nodesprocesses.p  pThe issue that caused most of my initial problems with getting scripts working was rather obscure and apparently due to issues with hosts files on the nodes. Running mpiexec with the codedisablehostnamepropagationcode parameter solved this problem, which may manifest itself in a variety of ways MPIR barrier errors, TCP connect errors and other generic connection failures. I believe it may be necessary for all nodes in the cluster to know one another by hostname, which is not really an issue in classic Beowulf clusters that have DHCPDNS running on the server node.p

However, when I run it, I get the expected SQL error... but the value of i is set from 99 to 1.

I have managed to do this within a single Java file, but I cant make it work in separate files. Any input is appreciated.

Negative 1926 pI have taken apples simple FTP Sample and edited it to my needs. did not change the uploading partp  pIt reports that the upload went fine, and the file is indeed on the FTP  but if i download the file and open it jpg images mainly i get the error message that the file is corrupted. p  pthe only thing i have changed is that when the transfer is finished the connection is forced to close, instad of remaining alive waiting for other uploads. p  pi think that the program is assigining the last chunk of data to the upload stream and once that is done it assumes that it has finished, without wating for the stream to upload that last chunk.. is that possible is there a way to see if the networkstream outputstream has data in its buffer i seem to be able to do that only for the inputstream but not for the outpustream.p  pUPDATE after comparing the uploaded file with the original file with a hex editor i found out that the files are identical, except that the uploaded one has the final part chopped off. the chopped off part is not allways the same size. it varies between 0 and 256 kb...p  pUPDATE2br           codeNSLogntstrm zu, self.networkStream.streamStatuscode is allways returning 2 even while it is uploading. while uploading it should return 4 then after closing it returns 0. but never 4...p  pUPDATE3 the only solution i found so far is to put a timer in and wait 15 seconds before i close the connection. but this is not something i want to do because the program i used to upload MANY files and if for each file i ahve to stop 15 seconds its a huge pain.  any help appreciated.p

This was my original issue. Just to confirm the original solution worked, if I move my Select button into the save div containing the label for Location, it passes the correct location label labelAccordionLocation value for what ever row I have expanded but always passes the first rows name label value. It also works correct if the Select button is in the save div as the Name label labelAccordionName.p  pBased on the suggestion in my other post which worked flawlessly for my original example, it seems that I now need to figure out how to identify the div that contains each label so I can then pass its value when the Submit button is clicked.

Negative 1926 pHello StackOverflowers,p  pI am designing a game for Android where I plan on allowing the user to move in four different directions up, down, left, and right. I would like to implement this using either Sensor.TYPEACCELEROMETER or Sensor.TYPEORIENTATION. If I am doing only the abovefourspecified directions, is there an advantage to using Sensor.TYPEACCELEROMETER over Sensor.TYPEORIENTATION, or vice versa Thanks in advance for your answers, help, and suggestions.p  pJustin.p

Negative 1926 pIn Raphael you can load up images in the following mannerp  precodevar imageonepaper.imagesomeurl, x,y,width,height codepre  pBut the thing is that I am splicing the image, and I need several of those cuts, preferably without reloading the original image. That is because loading up only a single large image via http is faster than many small.

Negative 1926 pIve come across a very strange feature of the ListView. Hopefully someone can help me out here.p  pWhen you create a ListView on your Window, it comes with a default spacing between the border and the content. I guess its a padding of 2 left and right if you look at the Snoop information. The ListBoxChrome part of the ListView is in my case 363px wide. The ScrollViewer inside it is 359px. Theres nothing set on both these controls. Even a new project with a simple ListView has this issue.p  pOne workaround is to give the header cells a padding of 2, but for some reason the headers wont fill until the right and leaves me with a wider gap at the right.p  pSomeone here to help me outp  pSome screenshotsp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comAKbDfwQ.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comAKbDfwQ.pngap  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.compQtqMJ4.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.compQtqMJ4.pngap

Consider main block as a dictionary with around 10 characters for the title. In each main block there will be from 110 max 10 sub blocks which are also dictionaries. Each sub block will contain some plain text data. Strings with no more than 100 characters or maybe 200300.  p  pI will need to read this data and also mingle it around a bit swap a main block or two and swap a sub block or two.  p  pI need it to be as fast as possible since I already have quite some stuff in my app so I was wondering what should I use A Property List file or a SQLite databasebr SQLite database is basically a text file with a code wrapper around it that manipulates its contents so my guess is that in my situation a plist file will be faster...p  pAs said data will not exceed a few ten kilobytes hope not P.p  pEDIT To add a bit of information main blocks are views that need to be loaded in this order and sub blocks are subviews on main views that need to be in this order. Some data is data that will be fed to those views. So order of main views and subviews will be changed from time to time and data for sub views will be reloaded when the user decides to. Hope this helps a bit.p

Im trying to implement this using php and some bash scripting.p  pMy php script on server 1 runs a bash script on the same server.  The bash script uses [ssh t userserver screen sudo python pythscript.py] to attempt to run the python script on server2.  Please note that I am using the t option.  The bash script also has a scp command to copy a file from server1 to server2.  I have used keys to enable ssh commands from server1 to server2 without requiring a password.p  pWhen I run the bash script from the command line, it functions perfectly.  The screen on server2 is activated and the python program runs inside it.  I have run the bash script as the normal user, as root and as wwwdata the php script is run through apache and is user wwwdata.  Under any of the users, the bash script works as expected when run from the command line.p  pWhen I run the bash script via the php script click on an html form that fires off the php script, then the scp command works correctly and the file is transferred, however the python script does not run.  The output from the php line containing ssh ... screen ... returns Must be connected to a terminal., but Im using the t option and as I mentioned, the bash script runs as expected when run from the command line.p  pAny ideas what Im doing wrongp  pWhat is the best way to run a python script remotely using a web interfacep  pThanks, rb3p

Here is the Activity monitor report.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuUfri.png altActivity monitor reportp  pLooking at the report I can see a total real memory usage sum of about 105 MB.

I am not sure if this somehow effects the Virtual Memory a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPagingpaginga performance.p  pEDIT 2 I have also looked more at SpringBoard and its Virtual Memory usage is 180 MB. Is this normal I found some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3558931springboardmemoryallocationiphoneipadquestionsanswersa that seem to suggest that SpringBoard is responsible for autoreleasing objects it should be the process for managing the screen and home botton but I am not sure if it has also to do with memory management. Is this correctp  pAnother note. I am using ARC. However I am not sure this has to do much with the issue as there are no apparent memory leaks and XCode should convert the code adding releasedeallocretain calls to the compiled binary.p  pEDIT 3 As said before I am using ARC and Cocos2d 2.0.

Negative 1926 pThe short form of the question  How can I draw in my QGLWidget using my FBO as a texture, without just getting a blank white imagep  pAnd, some background and details...  I am using Qt 5.1 for an app that does some image processing on the GPU.  have a compositor class which uses a QOffscreenSurface, with a QOpenGLContext, and a QOpenGLFramebufferObject. It renders some things to the FBO. If the app is running in a render only mode, the result will get written to a file. Run interactively, it gets shown on my subclass of QGLWidget the viewer.p  pIf I make a QImage from the FBO and draw that to the viewer, it works. However, this requires roundtripping from GPU QImage Back to the GPU as a texture. In theory, I should be able to use the FBO as a texture directly, which is what I want.p  pI am trying to share between my QOpenGLContext and the QGLWidgets QGLContext like sop  pviewer  new tluiglViewerthis compositor  new tlplaybackglCompositor1280, 720, this viewercontextcontextHandlesetShareContextcompositorcontextp  pIs it possible to share between the two types of contexts Is this the way to do it Do I need to do something else to draw in the viewer using the FBO in the compositor Im just getting solid white when I draw the FBO directly instead of the QImage, so Im clearly doing something wrong.  p  hr  pSo I have figured out my problem.  I was misinterpreting the documentation for setShareContext which notes that it Wont take effect until create is called which I mistakenly thought meant you had to share the context after it was created.

Negative 1926 pIs it totally impossible to download a pdf file through an XHR request I know there are many other discussions already on this topic but sadly, I am still not satisfied with them. I am using AngularJs and making a request by using its codeHttpcode method. It is not returning any file download popup. But if I hit with the same URL in a new Browser Window then I am getting a popup. I have already tried a workarround and its working fine i.e. codedocument.location.href  urlcode but If I do this then I am unable to show the waiting image till the time the download popup is ready and appeared. So the work arround is not enough for me. I would like to do it with a genuine way through a request to the server through which I can handle the alternative flows of the outcome as well.p

Negative 1926 pIm trying to implement quicksort in C.p  pIve done it before in Python, but Im new to C and trying it out please dont suggest I just use codeqsortcodep  pWhat I dont understand is that since C doesnt handle arrays in the same way as Python, i.e. it cant pass them to and return them from functions, can only pass a pointer to one or rather, the start of a space in memory  how then can an array be used in a recursive functionp  pIf my first call takes codefloat array[]code, chooses a pivot, and sorts it. How can I then make successive calls for the lower and upper partitions, and glue them back togetherp  pUnless Im mistaken, the glueing together requires an iteration through, since you cant assign to an array. But we cant do that, because we dont know how much memory we need on each call  and the spaces need to be different, because we still need the one higher on earlier call...p  pIve tried code, Ive tried pen and paper, I just cant make this work  I understand recursion conceptually and practically, in Python, I just cant see how to do this in C. I expect theres some functionality or syntax I just dont know about.p  pGrateful as ever.p

Negative 1926 pMy application got some GameOver activity which gets called when the game is over. This activity contains its own AdView. Now my problem is, everytime the player loses the game and this activity gets called, it takes some time for the adview to laod.  The problem is, the user can press on the restart button without even having seen the adView because it wasnt loaded. When pressing on the button another acitivty starts. My solution now was a delay on the button  the user has to wait 3 sec. to be able to press on the button. Thats not good for the user, nobody likes to wait.p  pSo is there any way to store the already used adView in the background while another activity gets called and load the adview when the gameOver activity gets called the next timep  pWhat is the most efficient way to show ads without having to reload them on every activity p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1926 pFor some hours im trying to add the openDeclaration function to my own Eclipse plugin editor. Until now I didint really understand how the f3 functionallity is working. I read something about Hyperlinking, openAction, compilationUnit.findDeclaringNode but i cannot but the peaces together and understand how they work.p  pUntil now i think this works like this  While parsing the code, the tokens which are read will be added to the ast. The hierachy level is IJavaProjectIPackageFragmentRootIPackageFragmentICompilationUnitIType  IField  IMethod With jdt it is possible to work with this ast. Each Java file is represented with a compilation unit. If i press f3 a ActionHandler is started with takes the IjavaElement which i hover in this moment.p  pRigth now i have the IJavaElement in my Editor PlugIn but i dont know how to jump to the corressponding typemethod with the declaration in the compilation unit.  And i dont know what will happen if the declaring node is not in the same complilation unit. For example if its a basic type like string or date.p  pMaybe everything is more clear, if I could follow the way how the default java editor is doing that. But i dont know how i can do that.  Can someone help to get the peaces together or to show me how i can debugg the functionallity.p

Negative 1926 pI have recently stumbled upon the game a hrefhttpgabrielecirulli.github.io20482048a. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make bigger tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with value of either code2code or code4code. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of code2048code.p  pOne, I need to follow a welldefined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.p  pMy current algorithmp  precodewhile gameover      for each possible move         countnoofmergesfor2tiles and 4tiles     choose the move with large number of merges  codepre  pWhat I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values code2code and code4code, that is, I try to have code2code and code4code tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.p  pBut, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the abovep

Negative 1926 pI have a table on a page loaded into an IFRAME which has a GET query string in the calling URL to direct the proper table data.  In addition, I have a jQuery system which updates the cells of the table as well as posting data to a PHP script to update a database.p  pOn FF and Chrome, the update happens as requested, and the table cell text is updated correctly per the jQuery.  No problems.p  pOn IE, after the script is run and the data is updated, the browser reloads the IFRAME content using the URL without a query string which obviously breaks the display.  IEs Web Developer Network Monitor shows the IFRAME page request and states that it originated with a click on a hyperlink which obviously did not happen.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong emOn further testing using cookies to retain the query string data, it appears that something in the post is causing the entire frame to reload.

Negative 1926 pIm testing out a way to print out stdout from several subprocesses in Python 2.7. What I have setup is a main process that spawns, at the moment, three subprocesses and spits out their output. Each subprocess is a forloop that goes to sleep for some random amount of time, and when it wakes up, says Slept for X seconds.p  pThe problem Im seeing is that the printing out seems synchronous. Say subprocess A sleeps for 1 second, subprocess B sleeps for 3 seconds, and subprocess C sleeps for 10 seconds. The main process stops for the full 10 seconds when its trying to see if subprocess C has something, even though the other two have probably slept and printed something out. This is to simulate if a subprocess truly has nothing to output for a longer period of time than the other two.p  pI need a solution which works on Windows.p  pMy code is as followsp  pmainprocess.pyp  precodeimport sys import subprocess  logfile  openlogfile.txt, w processes  [             subprocess.Popenpython subproc1.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,              subprocess.Popenpython subproc2.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,              subprocess.Popenpython subproc3.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,          ]   while True     line  processes[0].stdout.readline      if line           sys.stdout.writeline         logfile.writeline      line  processes[1].stdout.readline     if line           sys.stdout.writeline         logfile.writeline      line  processes[2].stdout.readline     if line           sys.stdout.writeline         logfile.writeline      If everyone is dead, break     if processes[0].poll is not None and         processes[1].poll is not None and         processes[2].poll is not None         break  processes[0].wait processes[1].wait  print Done codepre  psubproc1.pysubproc2.pysubproc3.pyp  precodeimport time, sys, random  sleeptime  random.random  3 for x in range0, 20     print [PROC1] Slept for 0 seconds.formatsleeptime     sys.stdout.flush     time.sleepsleeptime     sleeptime  random.random  3 this is different for each subprocess. codepre  pstrongUpdate Solutionstrongp  pTaking the answer below along with a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions375427nonblockingreadonasubprocesspipeinpythonthis questiona, this is this should work.p  precodeimport sys import subprocess from threading import Thread  try     from Queue import Queue, Empty except ImportError     from queue import Queue, Empty  for Python 3.x  ONPOSIX  posix in sys.builtinmodulenames  def enqueueoutputout, queue     for line in iterout.readline, b         queue.putline     out.close  if name  main     logfile  openlogfile.txt, w     processes  [                 subprocess.Popenpython subproc1.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,                  subprocess.Popenpython subproc2.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,                  subprocess.Popenpython subproc3.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,              ]     q  Queue     threads  []     for p in processes         threads.appendThreadtargetenqueueoutput, argsp.stdout, q      for t in threads         t.daemon  True         t.start      while True         try             line  q.getnowait         except Empty             pass         else             sys.stdout.writeline             logfile.writeline             logfile.flush          break when all processes are done.         if allp.poll is not None for p in processes             break      print All processes done codepre  pIm not sure if I need any cleanup code at the end of the while loop.

Negative 1926 pIm new to f. Im wanting to return a list of search results to the front end. However, there could be several types of search results e.g. codeBlogResultcode,codeMovieResultcode, etc each with their own properties e.g. codeMovieResult.PosterIconcode. The UI will be aware of these types and will display each type accordingly. The core search API will not be aware of these types and is only providing a framework that a provider needs to implement including the type that it will return. For example, a codeBlogProvidercode would implement the necessary functions and its corresponding search result type. The application will register all of these providers together into the core framework such that all results should be returned in ranked order as a single list of items. It is highly likely that these providers will each exist in their own assembly, separate from both the application and the core search API.p  pMy OO brain wants to have a codeSearchResultcode class or interface that all the other result types inherit from. Is there a more functional way to handle thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong The application is an ASP.NET MVC application. Each result is represented by a partial view. The site itself does not need to be modified when a new search result type is added. There is only the new partial view. This does not violate the OpenClosed principle. Technically I could have the provider create the template for the partial view. However the ceremony code is not worth the effort.p

Negative 1926 pI have mock product data hard coded into a JSON file that I use to generate catalogue pages in my application. However, the ultimate plan is to allow users to add new products via a CMS style admin panel. p  pObviously I need this data to be persistent. The obvious choice would be to use MySQL or some other database, but since this a a pretty complex data structure with lots of nesting I cant imagine how that could be achieved painlessly. I could simply store the JSON in a text file on the server but then I lose the ability to manipulate it and have to send the whole set each time I make a change. Then again that would only be when people added and removed  products so perhaps it wouldnt be so bad. Perhaps I could decode the JSON with PHP, manipulated it and then reserialize it into JSON and save it into a text file.p  pSorry, Im rambling here.

Negative 1926 pI am looking to manipulate some records in my mongo db before I pass them on to an aggregate function.  In particular, I need to sum up some properties of the collection before I perform a sum on these properties.p  pThe summing of the properties cannot initially be done in an aggregation query because the property names vary in the original collection.  For example, I am starting with something likep  precode timestamp 1346774400000, foo3 12, foo45 13, foo9 2 ,   timestamp 1346796000000, foo7 33, foo2 5  codepre  pI need to modify each document to sum up the values for each property beginning with foo, then sum all these values for each document in the collection.  p  pI wrote a map operation to do so, which would produce something likep  precode timestamp 1346774400000, foototal 27 ,   timestamp 1346796000000, foototal 38   codepre  p...but I cannot perform an aggregate function on the output of db.collection.map.  p  pIs there any way to accomplish this or alternatively a better method to do so  I am not able to change the existing structure of the documents and I would like to avoid doing a map reduce operation and I do not want to offload this operation into code.p

Negative 1926 pSo I have a pretty specific problem that I am not sure how to handle. I am still in development of an Android app, and part of that app involves a ViewPager and a set of Fragments that act as sort of a wizard submittal of a report where the last report in the ViewPager is as submit button that sends data back to the report. My problem is when the report is submitted, I need to destroy the ViewPager so that when the user attempts to submit the report again, it is completely new. I am looking for a feasible way to accomplish this.p

Negative 1926 pI have a problem that I am having trouble resolving. Every two seconds a timerelapsed event fires and moves to the next item in a group of choices. While this is happening, the application is waiting to hear a command using the Microsoft.Speech speech recognition libraries. When it hears that command it is supposed to move to the next group of choices. Sometimes though, the command comes exactly when the timer elapses and because the speech recognition is moving asynchronously the speechrecogonized event will move the choices to the next group while the timer will move within its group. p  pTo control the movement through groups, I have created a set of modes. The timer will call a function based on the current mode. Speech controls what mode youre in and is changed within the speechrecognized event. I have tried putting the timer.stop at the very beginning of the speechrecognized event but that is useless. They are called together at the same time quite often.p  pI am a beginning to average programmer. I understand the concepts behind threads but dont really have much experience working with them.

Negative 1926 pIm working on a 2d game in java swing, where a procedurally generated environment is represented by a tiled array of lowres images.  Currently this is all within html tags for line breaks in a JLabel.  p  pOn top of this, I would like to display character sprites, which will not take up an entire tile, but will have some alpha components.  In the past, in JShtml and JScanvas, I have simply made sprite tiles with alpha channels and positioned them directly above a floor tiles, using tables andor absolute positioning.p  pIn java swing, however, absolute positioning and most of html for that matter doesnt seem to work so well.p  pSince a sprite will never be betweenoverlapping two floor tiles, the obvious solution is to make a bunch of precomputed image files outside the game  one for each character over each type of floor tile, however, this would scale disk space and work exponentially with the number of images used, and seems like it shouldnt be necessary.p  pFrom what Ive seen, it looks like it should be possible to create all these images in runtime as Bufferedimages, either by precomputing them all at startup, or making some each frame as needed.p  pIf I can do the above, I might also be able to put all the images I need into one big bitmap each frame, and display that.  This could also reduce nonsynchronized loading of frames if I overload the system.p  pOf the above options, what seems like the best or is there another obvious solution that I am completely missing  If the solution is to make composite images, could someone point me in the right direction as far as how to do that  Thanks a lot.p

Negative 1926 pOne of the benefits of Sidekiq over Resqueue is that it can run multiple jobs in the same process.  The drawback, however, is I cant figure out how to force a set of concurrent jobs to run in different processes.  p  pHeres my use case say I have to generate 64M rows of data, and I have 8 vCPUs on an amazon EC2 instance.  Id like to carve the task up into 8 concurrent jobs generating 8M rows each.  The problem is that if Im running 8 sidekiq processes, sometimes sidekiq will decide to run 2 or more of the jobs in the same process, and so it doesnt use all 8 vCPUs and takes much longer to finish.  Is there any way to tell sidekiq which worker to use or to force it to spread jobs in a group evenly amongst processesp

Negative 1926 pC offers some nice methods to serialize classes to XML and deserialize them afterwards. I currently have a set of XML files in a custom format, that is currently read by custom functions using XPath accesses. However this duplicates a lot of code. The least is that I have to write both a serialization and a deserialization routine.p  pHowever what I gain with this, is that I can verify the input as it is read XML files basicly are themes to modify the look of the application and therefore could be modified by a user by handp  pTo make it clear an examplep  precodestruct SText   string Text   int height   SColor color  struct SColor   int R,G,B  codepre  pand read byp  precodeSText text bool oktrue ok amp xml.ReadtextText, out text.Text ok amp xml.Readtextheight, out text.height ok amp xml.ReadRangetextColorR, out text.color.R, 0, 1 ok amp xml.ReadRangetextColorG, out text.color.G, 0, 1 ok amp xml.ReadRangetextColorB, out text.color.B, 0, 1 codepre  pI think you get the picture.p  pAs you can see, I basicly already have double stuff specifying XPath and element and could completely use the standard XMLSerializer from .NET. However that deserializer wont show any errors if the value of a field is invalid or even missing.p  pOnly thing I can come up is using a xsd file describing the structs, but then everytime I change the struct Id have to change the xsd too, although all the information structure and types is already there. Although Id have to check e.g. ranges afterwards somehow...

Negative 1926 pI had this bug at work today  wont be able to test it until I get back there after the weekend but thought someone might know the answer offhand.p  pI have two scripts, file1.php and file2.php.  They are located in the same folder within my codebase.  Said codebase includes many many files, including a global header file which calls several other files and pretty much sets up any file to run on our environment.p  pWhat I would like to do is run file2.php from within a codeshellexeccode or codeexeccode from file1.php.  However, when I do this, file2.php doesnt recognize the file header.php unless provided with the absolute filepath, and even when it is provided, not all calls to other files there are several codeincludecodes, coderequirecodes, etc, in header.php succeed  though some do.p  pAt the point where I left it, the latest file that was not included had been correctly identified by providing the complete filepath to it as well as opposed to only the relative one, but I received an unidentified function error on codeapachenotecode, which is a function bundled with PHP.p  pIm running these from the command line, and when I run only test2.php alone it works fine, but when it is accessed by way of codeexeccode from file2.php, this is my situation.  Is there something Im missing about codeexeccode  Is there a way to run the second file as if in exactly the same environment as the first one  I tried codeputenvcode with no success, but perhaps theres a trick involving thatp  pHelp or ideas greatly appreciated, though I wont be able to check for a couple of days.

Negative 1926 pI have WAS 6.1 on codencode physical nodes, one Application Server codeAScode for each node. I have a queue implemented in Websphere MQ which is consumed by an MDB pool one for each server.p  pI need, in some specific cases, to limit the number of messages consumed to a number codemcode, with codemcode possibly lesser than codencode. This is because each consumed message produces a call to an external system which could have overload issues.p  pNow I know I can do this in each codeAScode separately, but what if codemltncode and I want my MQ, in simple words, to work as in a monolithic environment Is there some shared configuration I can dop
Negative 1926 pIn my database I have a table KeyFrame which has several columns. Besides some general information about the keyframe, I have a column to identify to which video the keyframe belongs videoid. Also I have a column to store the information at which time the keyframe is shown in the video e.g. the keyframe is at second 2 in the video timecode.p  pNow another application sends me a list of strings in the form 12345123 where the first number is the videoid and the second number the timecode. This list can have several thousand entries.p  pNow imagine I get the following listp  precode1123 1124 1125 2123 2124 codepre  pWhat I currently do is, I create a huge SQL which looks something like the followingp  precodeSELECT k FROM KeyFrame k WHERE videoid1 AND timecode IN 123,124,125 OR videoid  2 AND timecode IN 123,124 codepre  pAs you can imagine, with several thousand entries, especially when the videoid is different, the SQL grows in size. However, thats not a big deal for the database. Executing the statement directly on the database only takes some milliseconds. But since I use hibernate to get my Entities, this takes a while. The main problem is the following line. With 22k entries in the list it takes more than 30 seconds to load all the entities, which is not acceptable because the other appliation will time out.p  precodeTypedQueryltKeyFramegt q  em.createQueryhqlBuff.toString, KeyFrame.class codepre  pstrongMy question isstrong how could I possibly speed up my application Is there any common name for this kind of problem and if so, whats the best practicep  pThank you in advance Janp  pPS Unfortunately I cannot use some kind of paging functionality in the webservice call. p

Negative 1926 pIm planning to modernize the photo gallery on my website. Currently I use the Colorbox plugin to open the large image and legend in a lightbox after clicking on a thumbnail. Google indexes the pictures and legends yet optimal.p  pMy new photo gallery should be responsive and I want to show not only the photo and legend inside of the lightbox, but also further information like date, location, camera, tags, etc. Thats why I will use the Ajax option rather than the standard gallery option of the lightbox plugin.p  pThe thumbnails are compiled dynamically based on filtering and sorting settings and the information about the photos is stored in a database. So I will use a PHP script to get the necessary information and to set up the HTML code for the Ajax call dynamically. That should be no problem.p  pMy question is Will the contents that is loaded via Ajax in the Magnific Popup be indexed by Google Unfortunately I do not think so, because if I make a Google search for a part of the text which is displayed in the Ajax Lightbox on a hrefhttpdimsemenov.compluginsmagnificpopup relnofollowhttpdimsemenov.compluginsmagnificpopupa, this page does not appear in the Google results...p  pIs there a solution Or can you recommend another responsive Lightbox wherein the Ajax content will be indexedp  pThank you for any suggestion Michellep

The database and application are on the same machine and the performance is terrible, the user wants to install the application at the 4 plants with sql server and the performance is going to be a even bigger problem due to the fact that multiple people will be accessing the application, we will have network bottlenecks. From Sql Server point of view i added indexes, updated the statistics, try to see if there is a way i can make the query fetch the results faster but from a report viewer and report designer point of view i am clueless any help will be much appreciated.p

Negative 1926 pI couldnt find any relative command to convert the file to little endian. As i receive the data file from system and I use the codesqlldrcode to load the data into oracle table.

Negative 1926 pI am working on a project that looks at a worksheet and dynamically creates a frame on a userform, a label with caption from a cell on the worksheet, a check box and two option buttons.  This process is iterated based on however many rows are on the sheet.  There are multiple sheets and each sheet has a userform associated to it.  In essence, each sheetform paring does the same thing.  I want to be able to either select the check box or one of the option buttons for each frame.  If the check box is selected, the option buttons should be disabled.  The option buttons work properly within each frame but aside from that, there is not any connection to the cells after they are created.  I have tried to incorporate WithEvents and Collections, but have not been able to figure it out.  Now I get an object does not source automation events error.  I started out hard coding all the innerworkings of the frames, so I know my logic for the check boxes and option buttons work, but I really want to be able to dynamically create these.  Any insight is greatly appreciated.p  pHere is the class ClassOLFp  precodeOption Explicit  Public Collect As Collection  Private WithEvents cbox As MSForms.Checkbox Private WithEvents optbtn1 As

Negative 1926 pWere running a Jersey 1.x based service in Tomcat on AWS in an array of 20 instances Periodically an instance goes bad over the course of about 4 hours its heap and CPU usage increase until the heap is exhausted and the CPU is pinned.

Negative 1926 pIm frequently using the dowhilecheckNextForNullgetNext looping pattern dont know if there is an official name for it in some of my projects. But in Java8, the use of Optional is considered as cleaner code than checking for null references in clientcode. But when using Optional in this looping pattern, the code gets a bit verbose and ugly, but because Optional has some handy methodS, I would expect that there must exist a cleaner way than the one I came up with below.p  pExamplep  pGiven the following class.p  precodeclass Item      int nr      Itemnr          this.nr  nr          an expensive operation           Item next          return ...someCondition....              new Itemnr  1              null       codepre  pIn which the first item always has nr1 and each item determines the next item, and you dont want to create unnecessary new items.p  pI can use the following looping dowhilecheckNextForNullgetNext pattern in clientcodep  precodeItem item  new Item1 do       do something with the item ....  while item  item.next  null codepre  pWith Java8Optional, the given class becomesp  precodeclass Item      ....      OptionalltItemgt next          return ...someCondition....              Optional.ofnew Itemnr  1              Optional.empty       codepre  pAnd then the dowhilecheckNextForNullgetNext looping pattern becomes a bit ugly and verbosep  precodeItem item  new Item1 do       do something with the item ....  while item  item.next.orElsenull  null codepre  pThe codeorElsenull  nullcode part feels uncomfortable.p  pI have looked for other kind of loops, but havent found a better one.

Negative 1926 pI am having trouble figuring out how to store client handles without blocking the server. I am following the concurrent server model detailed in The Socket Networking API by Stevens. p  pMy program creates tic tac toe matches between players. p  pThe structure of the program is this The server handles both TCPUDP connections. The client program can either query or connect to the server. If the client queries, the UDP socket handles the query by returning a list of the handles of already connected clients. p  pIf the client connects, the TCP socket handles the connection by 1. Asking the client for a handle and 2. Storing their handle. If there are two clients who are connected, a separate process is spawned to create a match between them but this is not relevant now. p  pIn my program, I am multiplexing the TCPUDP socket with codeselectcode. My current issue is how to deal with asking and storing client handles without blocking. p  pI have consideredp  ol licreating another thread to deal with asking and receiving client handle. li lipKeeping a list of of connected client sockets and add them to fdset data structure and multiplex between them in addition to the TCPUDP sockets.pli lipSpawning another process to deal with askingreceiving handles, but this is not probable since I am storing the handles in a global linked list data structure so that the server can return a list when queried.

Negative 1926 pIve an integration test where Im deploying 2 web services in Wildfly using Arquillian and ShrinkWrap resolver. Both services are independent such that neither is dependent on the other in any Maven dependency sense. Service 2 makes a HTTP call to service 1.

Even if the pointer is codeconstcode, the object it points to is nonconst, so indeed the nonconst member function codeAbarcode is called this is the whole point of the proposal in the paper, to avoid this seemingly awkward situation and propagate codeconstcode via a wrapper. Furthermore, they say that to avoid this situation, once can codeconstcastcode the pointer codemptrAcode in codeBfoo constcode, so it calls the desired codeAbar constcode. p  pI tried countless combinations but frankly I dont know how to codeconstcastcode the codeuniqueptrcode.

Is this possible What am I looking for I cannot find it in the Android API. p  pIdeally it would be a user opens this app I want to create and turn it on and then your phone thinks headphones are plugged in or something similiar and then when they play spotify, youtube, soundcloud, pandora, or any output that it is sent to these virtual headphonesspeaker and actually the sound is sent over the network to this pioneer device VSX1123K.p  pI would ideally like to create this with cordova or something, but if I have to build this native I will. p

The answer refers to a pane in the show output from window that does not appear in my version of luaedit.  My version only has an output window that is accessible off of the debug dropdown menu.  Though it does say show output from, there does not appear to be any way to change where it shows its output from.  The answer also refers to a green button to start debugging that is also not available in my version of the editor.  Instead, there are three buttons on the left side of the toolbar  a triangular start debugging button, a double horizontal line break now button and a square stop debugging button, all of which are blue.p  pSo...how is the problem to be solved for THIS version of this editor  Or is it a bug that the developers introduced because they had to fix an interface that wasnt brokenp

Negative 1926 pI work at home  I have a macbook with 2 two hardwired network connections. One goes through a VPN router to work, the other connects to my local network. Both are configured for DHCP, provide default routes, default search domains, and DNS resolution.p  pWhichever I connect first gets priority  the other is available, but DNS resolution doesnt work with that domain obviously. I connect my work NIC first, then my home NIC, so everything goes out through the VPN router by default, unless its specifically destined for the 192.168.168.024 network.

Negative 1926 pIm working on some development in Java touching an Oracle database.

Is there a better way to iterate through an Oracle database table in Java some of these tables are too big so I wont be able to load them wholesale into memory rather than this query  Is there a different type of query that I can use  Is there any known reason why this would be returning null when the same query works in SQL Developerp

Negative 1926 pI have a rather complex C99 conform shared library. It contains a large number of global variables and many short functions, but only a few are used by the user directly. p  pId like to refactor it into a threadsafe library. To do that, I would make the user pass a handle to each function. The handle would be a pointer to a struct which contains what were previously global variables. p  pPerformance is important in this case and I dont want to jeopardize it. What do I need to be careful about when implementing handles For example, a typical function looks like thisp  precodevoid calculate     for int i0 iltN i            particle[i].x  G  particle[i].y         otherfunctionthatdoessomethingtoparticle       codepre  pNaively, I would add a handle like thisp  precodevoid calculatestruct Handle h     for int i0 ilthgtN i            hgtparticle[i].x  hgtG  hgtparticle[i].y         otherfunctionthatdoessomethingtoparticleh       codepre  pwhich looks rather inefficient.

And what i wanted to do is, when i click one of the items of the menu, a child item by the way, it oppens an URL, like facebook or a website. I managed to do that but it oppens in a browser, in chrome. My idea was to oppen in the app, without closing it. I saw some tutorials and that is possible using a master detal flow activity. Is there any way to do with this simples expandable listview p  phere i have the code to open the url, but outsite the app, the one that opens it is the groupPosition 3, childPosition 0p  precodepublic boolean onChildClickExpandableListView parent, View v, int groupPosition, int childPosition, long id              int pos  childPosition             ifgroupPosition  5                 switchpos                      case 0                         Intent i  new IntentMainActivity.this, Contatos.class                         MainActivity.this.startActivityi                                           ifgroupPosition  3                 switchpos                     case 0                         Intent browserIntent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONVIEW, Uri.parsehttpswww.facebook.commoises.transporte.passageirosfrefts                         startActivitybrowserIntent                                           return false          codepre

Negative 1926 pso I am making this game in Swift and I have included the code of what I have done on the GameScene.swift file. I have 4 different objects that will need to be recreated at run time after every 0.2 seconds dont even know how to do that , however using the code I currently have, if I try to move the coin20, coin100, or coin50 image, they dont move, only coin10 gets moved to their location and is far too sensitive so it just moves around like crazy whilst the other images are static. I hope this question is specific enough since my past questions werent well received by answerers, if not please let me know how to improve, im just a beginner in programming.

Here are my findingsp  pAs an example, I use the huHU Hungarian dictionary files .dic and .aff, which is the one I would need to extend with specialized domain vocabulary for an application. To keep the example transparent to English speakers I have chosen a name McNamara which is not yet included in the huHU dictionaries. Since Hungarian is a morphologically very rich language, I need to care about the declination of the word, otherwise the stemming of the word will not work. p  pcodeMcNamaracode follows the same declination pattern as codeTamaracode which is already recognized and can be stemmed correctly, e.g. for the word Tamarval with Tamarap  precodeimport hunspell  hobj  hunspell.HunSpellusrsharehunspellhuHU.dic, usrsharehunspellhuHU.aff stem  hobj.stemTamarval printstem codepre  pwill output [Tamara], which is correct.p  pNow, if I try to call add with the new word and the example p  precodeimport hunspell  hobj  hunspell.HunSpellusrsharehunspellhuHU.dic, usrsharehunspellhuHU.aff hobj.addMcNamara, Tamara codepre  pThis will throw me a codeTypeError function takes exactly 1 argument 2 givencode. And yet the suggestion by RedX based on the C code seems logical. p  pAlso if I call the addMcNamara with a single argument, it only seems to add the new word for the current session, not for the next run of the script, e.g.p  precodehobj.addMcNamara printhobj.spellMcNamara codepre  pThis prints codeTruecode, but the next time I run the script with only the last line, it will return a codeFalsecode. p

Negative 1926 pWhich is the best way in terms of insert performance to implement autoincrement functionality in Oracle 11.2 when you need to retrieved the newly generated key using JDBCp  pI know there are identity columns in Oracle 12, but Im stuck with 11.2 right now.p  pLike many others, I have had no luck in getting the JDBC getGeneratedKeys to work with Oracle. I ended up having trigger in my Oracle 11.2 database that acts like a MySQL autoincrement function and inserts the NextVal from a table specific sequence to act as its primary key whenever there is an insert into that table. This made getting the newly inserted key difficult though, I ended up doing a 2nd query to get the newly generated key.p  pMore recently I discovered CallableStatement with return values and I see how these could be used to do everything with 1 call.p  pIs this last method generally a faster way of doing inserts when you also need that newly generated key or is there a better option for me that I am missingp

Negative 1926 pI would like to know what people recommend for geocoding city inputs from users. I am trying to get the LatLong of a city a user inputs.

Negative 1926 pIm struggling to understand how user pinned shortcuts in windows explorer work in relation to windows installer. I was under the impression that the User Pinned shortcuts were completely user handled, but it seems windows installer will find and modify user pinned shortcuts when installer shortcuts are removed. p  pThis is basically two related questions, one relating to emearlyem scheduling of uninstall, and relating to emlateem scheduling, and in particular emchangingem from early to late between versions.p  h2Cached internal icons from msis still work after upgradeh2  pExample Application v1.0 installs a nonadvertised shortcut on the desktop, and uses an icon internal to the msi. The user then does pin to taskbar. Both the taskbar and the desktop shortcut now references an icon copied from the msi into the icon cache, such as codeSystemRootInstallerCB24D0974E8F4E8E8FE3EACF5954DE56MyApp.icocode.  Application is upgraded to v2.0 via a Major upgrade with late scheduled removal of v1. The user pinned shortcut will not be corruptedremoved, it emkeepsem the same icon even though the icon presumably belonged only to the v1 installer Why does this work Is there ever a risk that the cached icon will be removed in the future, thereby corrupting the user pinned shortcutp  h2Early scheduling of uninstall corrupts user pinned shortcutsh2  pIf application is upgraded from v1.0 to v2.0 with a Major Upgrade using an emearlyem uninstall of the previous version, then as the application temporarily removes the installerprovided shortcut on the desktop, something also corrupts the user pinned shortcut. The only workaround I have found short of programatically hacking shortcuts back into place is to make the installer emnotem remove shortcuts at all, instead removing the .lnk via doing a codeltRemoveFile onuninstallgtcode for the shortcut. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21241828wixdonotremovepinnedtaskbaroninstallWix  Do Not Remove Pinned Taskbar on Installa Now, this hack works well enough for a chain of major upgrades that all have uninstall scheduled early, and as described in the previous paragraphs  late scheduling seems to always work even without hacksp  pHowever, what if v1.0 is already shipped with emlateem uninstall, and v2.0 is the first upgrade to uninstall the previous version earlyp  pemIs there any way I can influence the uninstall of v1.0 in the V2.0 msi Specifically, can I somehow persuade the v1.0 uninstall to skip the remove shortcuts stepemp
