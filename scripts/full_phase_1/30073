Positive 30073 pI have to insert many documents in a MongoDB collection, using the new C 2.0 driver. Is using either collection.InsertManyAsync...  collection.BulkWriteAsync... making any difference particularly about performance.p  pFrom what i understand from MongoDB documentation, an insert with an array of documents should be a bulk operation under the hood. Is that correct p  pThanks for your help.p

Positive 30073 pWe are planning to use MongoDB for a general purpose system and it seems well suited to the particular data and use cases we have. p  pHowever we have one use case where we will need to compare every document of which there could be 10s of millions with every other document. The distance measure could be pre computed offline by another system but we are concerned about the online performance of MongoDB when we want to query  eg when we want to see the top 10 closest documents in the entire collection to a list of specific documents ... p  pIs this likely to be slow Also can this be done across documents eg query for the top10 closest documents in one collection to a document in another collection...p  pThanks in advance,p  pFKp

Positive 30073 pI am experiencing this odd behaviour with mongo shell.p  pI know the documents are created because I can then call them up in the browser when I do a request, however when I run mongo shell and do a db.collectionname.count etc. it returns nothing.p  pMight happen because I didnt shutdown the server properly etc.  I am certain data is the only directory that mongod uses for database storage and I have tried deleting all filesdatabases in this directory and they are created again when Node.js application runs and the documents are created too, but mongo shell shows nothing in the collections after I insert data into them. The show dbs command will show the database and show collections shows the collections, but nothing that is in the collection.p  pAny ideas  Perhaps theres some way to flush cache or something else that may be effecting mongo shell p

Positive 30073 pGood Morning and day to all I hope this makes sense.

The connection last about 1 minute before it loses it. However now it doesnt connect at all.

Positive 30073 pSimple MEAN stack prototype, using yo and meanjs and its crud modules.  There are four typescollections of articles.  p  pStep 1 One view for user if its that users personal page auth, theyre loggedin, this user for this page  loggedin user, they can editdelete from the four collections of articles they have saved to their page so far, so good, no problem here.p  pArticle in Mongodb  p  pTitle xx,p  pDate xxp  pSource where the article was found.  this will be either 1 some news database or 2 a saved article from another users profile page see step 2 for applicable functionalityp  pUser the user that chose to save the article to hisher page  used to populate the correct page.  this means that duplicate articles are saved multiple times, once for each user that has saved a copy see step 2 for applicable functionality.  not worried about solvable redundancy for this stage of prototypingp  ps3 reference  want to use cloudfront so that each time a user saves a new article, it gets saved to s3 as well, and the mongodb has an automatically generated reference to the link in s3.  A secondary question that I would love if you can answer as well.p  pp  pStep 2 If viewing the user view for an external user, it will still display all of the four types of articles that the external user has saved think of it as viewing someone elses profile page, in a very simplified way.  Obviously, when viewing someone elses user page, with their 4 types of article collections, you cant delete or edit someone elses articles.  p  pYou can, however, ideally  this is where Im having trouble save one of this external users articles to your own page.  When executingcreating this save method  the new article in Mongodb need to create a new one, NOT saveupdate over the old one, since each user has their own set of collections and maybe there is an entirely better way to think about each user having their own setassociated you can show me, we need to be specific about the source and user fieldsp  pNew Article Source the external users profile page where the loggedin user found the article same value as user for the articles existingold copy...not the loggedin user, but the userowner of the profile page being viewedbr New Article User the loggedin user who is actively saving from another users page, but this will take place on another users profile page  and I need it to NOT be the external user, that goes in source.  this is the user who saved the article after viewing it someone elses page, NOT the user that had saved it to their page originally...Im simply not sure how to refer to each for the above with regards to scope, this., etc.p  pMy inexperience with CRUD Restful methods makes it hard for me to see how to accomplish the above for the new saved article source and user fields in mongodb.  Source  old user and owner of the profile page where the article was found, user  the loggedin user that just now saved it, after viewing it on someone elses page.br Would also be wonderful if you can solve the issue of automatically generating the s3 reference in the mongodb when the new mongodb item is saved.p

Negative 30073 pI have a manytomany relationship between photos and tags A photo can have multiple tags and several photos can share the same tags. p  pI have a loop that scans the photos in a directory and then adds them to NHibernate. Some tags are added to the photos during that process, e.g. a 2009tag when the photo is taken in 2009. p  pThe Tag class implements Equals and GetHashCode and uses the Name property as the only signature property. Both Photo and Tag have surrogate keys and are versioned. p  pI have some code similar to the followingp  precodepublic void Import      ...     foreach var fileName in fileNames          var photo  new Photo  FileName  fileName          AddDefaultTagssession, photo, fileName         session.Savephoto          ...   private void AddDefaultTags      ...     var tag session.CreateCriteriatypeofTag                     .AddRestriction.EqName, year.ToString                     .UniqueResultltTaggt      if tag  null          photo.AddTagtag      else          var tag  new Tag  Name  year.ToString          session.Savetag         photo.AddTagtag       codepre  pMy problem is when the tag does not exist, e.g. the first photo of a new year. The AddDefaultTags method checks to see if the tag exists in the database and then creates it and adds it to NHibernate. That works great when adding a single photo but when importing multiple photos in the new year and within the same unit of work it fails since it still doesnt exist in the database and is added again. When completing the unit of work it fails since it tries to add two entries in the Tags table with the same name...p  pMy question is how to make sure that NHibernate only tries to create a single tag in the database in the above situation. Do I need to maintain a list of newly added tags myself or can I set up the mapping in such a way that it worksp

Negative 30073 pYesterday, I asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions893036bestpracticesforbuildingasearchappthis questiona regarding best practices for a simple information retrieval system I am beginning to work on.p  pToday, my customer asked me if it is possible to allow them to add fields to the primary entity at a later date using the administration interface. That is, the application allows you to search across one database table let us call it Entities, which may have various associations to other objects, but the focus is on the Entities.p  pNow, of course, the skys the limit, and this is possible.p  pMy initial thought with this problem is to create two new tablesp  pstrongAdditionalFieldsstrong FieldID emPKem, FieldName, IsShownInSearchResults, and other metadata This is the table that would have its rows created by the admin interface. For instance, if the customer later decides they want to add the ability to track, say, the  eye color an Entity, they would create an AdditionalField with a FieldName of Eye Color.p  pstrongAdditionalFieldDatastrong FieldDataID emPKem, EntityID emFKem, FieldID emFKem, FieldValue This is the table relating the Entities to the their respective values for any additional fields added by the customer. For instance, with our eye color example, if we have two Entities EntityID 3 and 4 at the time the field was added and the new AdditionalField has a FieldID of 1, it is valid to have no eye color data associated with the entities. The customer could then choose, to add the eye color Blue to Entity 3, and wed insert a row to AdditionalFieldData like this emautogenerated PKem, 3, 1, Blue.p  pSince I want to easily search across these, I will simply require that all additional fields have string values.p  pFollowing the approach I posted in the previous question, Id be using LinqToSQL with a query similar to the following for information retrieval when a user performs a search of course, the logic for filtering will be more complex in practicep  precodevar results  from s in db.Stuff           where s.Name.ContainstextFilter                   s.Title.ContainstextFilter           select s codepre  pI would modify the query to look something like thisp  precodevar results  from s in db.Stuff               where ...existing filter logic...                      s.AdditionalFieldData.Anyafd gt afd.FieldName.ContainstextFilter               select s codepre  pSo my question is Is this reasonable Is there a better solution that I missed Are there any implications of this approach that I should be aware ofp  pPlease forgive my silly identifiers, its early for me p

Negative 30073 pApple just released some sample code on lazy loading images in a UITableView a week ago. I checked it out and implemented it into my own UITableView which is a drawRect one for fast scrolling, to see if there was a difference from what I was already doing.p  pAfter implementing I am not sure what is best the new code or what I already had. I am not seeing much of a speed improvement on my 3GS.p  pSandbox method Load images lazily, then save to local tmp folder in the sandbox. emEach timeem the cell is displayed it looks for whether an image with that filename is already located in the sandbox folder. If it is, it retrieves the image and displays it, if not it continues with the download, saves it locally and then displays it. The benefit with this is that the images wont be blank the second time you open the app. They will already be downloaded and ready for displaying.p  pCaching method This also loads the images lazily, however, now I include a UIImage on each object in the array thats displayed in the tableview. Instead of saving the image locally, I now download the image and put it into the array for the object. Now, instead of checking for the filename every single time, it jut check whether the UIImage  nil and uses the cached image or downloads if nil.p  pA small difference is also that the caching code resizes the image before caching it to the exact size of what is displayed in the cell, whereas the image used in the sandbox code example is actually a bit larger than what it needs to display, which means it has to resize on the fly when scrolling as well. I read months ago that this could be a bit expensive to do, and I am also not sure whether it makes much of a difference in terms of then using a cached image instead of the sandboxstored image and therefore more CPU intensive anyway compared to what you save from caching with the caching code above.p  pI guess my question would be whether I should even bother with the caching code Again, the new code wont immediately load images on a new launch, whereas the old code actually does because its already in the sandbox. Since I am not reusing images, I have a lot of images to load from the sandbox or cache so I am not noticing a huge difference in speed. In fact, on my 3GS its almost impossible to tell, in my opinion. The scrolling is not silky smooth, and I assume this is due to the large amount of images that I cannot reuse different image for each cell. I am also wondering whether the sandbox method would get slower once theres 1000 images in the folder, for example, eventually having it look through many more images than just 100 or so.p  pI hope I am making sense. I wanted to be pretty thorough with the details, and I am happy to give more details if needed.p  pThanksp

Negative 30073 pWere looking at how to do distributed configuration within our primarily Java based deployment. We have a number of applications and it makes sense to centralise the configuration of the applications. JNDI appears to be the standard choice, probably backing off to something like ApacheDS that way we can store non Java config in there as well. Here are some of the things that Ive considered. Has anyone tried something similar Any recommendationsp  h3Distributedh3  pThis would be for multiple applications on multiple machines, some of the applications would be clustered. The Directory Server should also ideally be clustered.p  h3Lightweighth3  pJNDI has a bit of a J2EE feel to it. Anyone use an alternative distributed configuration mechanism. The applications themselves tend to be relatively lightweight rather than full Java EE applications ok controversial whether Java EE is still considered heavyweight and requirements are certainly heavyweight.p  h3Supports fallbacksh3  pOften the same configuration applies to multiple applications e.g. multiple applications may connect to the same database. One the other hand, some applications may need specific configuration. Sometimes it is difficult to know in advance whether an application will use a global configuration or something specific, so being able to first search for application  host specific configuration and then falling back would be good. Im thinking of a structure something like thisp  pglobalhostapplicationinstance or globalapplicationhostinstancep  pso, start by checking to see if there is any configuration specific to this instance of the application on this host, then check if there is any configuration specific to this application for this host, then check to see if there is anything specific for this application, then try the global setting. Are there any best practices for this kind of thingp  h3Live configuration changesh3  pSpring allows configuration with a jeejndilookup and you can choose not to cache the value which means it is looked up each request.

Negative 30073 pI have a few static library projects which are used in a Mac application, Im working on porting these libs to the iPhone and I would like to use the project to build both the Mac and iPhone versions.p  pFor that purpose I setup an additional target for the iPhone. This looks like it should work but I see that if I try, for example, to add the UIKit.framework to the project, the framework appears in red.p  pThe problem is, as far as I can see, that in the main project settings base sdk is tiger dont ask. I think I cant change this because I still have a target for mac. Or should Ip  pSo the question is, is it possible to target both mac and iphone from the same project and if so, what should I do with the Base sdk setting in the main project settingp
Negative 30073 h2Summaryh2  pA brief description of why anyone would want to attempt this. In a Maven project, I have a need to run tests against classes in codetargetclassescode, and a need to debug using the Eclipse Servers plugin tomcat within the Eclipse IDE, which is loading classes and a number of other assembled resources in codetargetltnameversionpackagegtWEBINFclassescode.  When my main source folder has output set at the codeWEBINFclassescode directory, tomcat debugging works great in the IDE. When the ouptut is changed to codetargetclassescode, the tests work fine too, as the test resources are properly assembled and loaded outside the context of the package.p  h2Problemh2  pThe issue is that I have to manually change my main source directorys output based on the task at hand testing or debugging in tomcat. The configuration and build changes would be prohibitively complex based on other configuration files, etc. to merely work around this.p  pTherefore, is there a straightforward way to tell Eclipse to output source into two directories That way the incremental Maven build of Java class files will be copied into both places and I wont have such a fragile configuration.p

Also, the emsolutionem doesnt work for elements where the closing tag is strongforbiddenstrong, e.g.p  precodeltBRgt codepre  por p  precodeltBRgtltBRgt codepre  pHow would i include a codeltBRgtcode element in my HTML output, given that it is strongforbiddenstrong in HTML to close a codeltBRgtcode element.p
Negative 30073 pWe have a SQL Job 2005 that from time to time will fail due a deadlock. The error is as follows  p  pTransaction Process ID 52 was deadlocked on thread  communication buffer resources with another process and has been chosen as the deadlock victim. Rerun the transaction. [SQLSTATE 40001] Error 1205. The step failed.p  pThis is an overnight job which effectively loads a reporting database and performs various corrections to the data. There are no other DML statements running simultaneously. The error occurs about once a week on differing days and at different points in the data load process. So I am presuming it is not due to DML statements.p  pTurning on Trace Flag 1222 provides information that is next to useless log records below. Most of the articles that I have read are related to transactions and queries and therefore locks related to data pagestables but not many related to memorythreadsbuffer resources. p  pI ran PerfMon with all counters that seemed relevant Network related, Available threads, Available Work Items, Log Buffer Waits as well as the usual ones such as Processor amp memory related but there was nothing immediately obvious.p  pAny help would be appreciated as nobody seems to know how to resolve this problem.p  pCheersp  pPreetp  p06212010 081730,spid5s,Unknown,waiter eventewaitPortOpen typeconsumer

Negative 30073 pMost CAs are selling code signing certificates in different products, like Verisign or Certump  ul lipMicrosoft Authenticode  Allows you to sign EXE, OCX, DLL, bla...pli lipJava CodeSign  Allows you to sign Java codepli lipSoftware Publisher Certificate  Allows you to sign softwarepli ul  pWell, I am REALLY confused about this. What is the difference between all these products  except the PRICE I asked Verisign and other CAs a few times since I am curious, but got no answer.p  pI got a Authenticode certificate from Certum CA. I enrolled it in Internet Explorer, exported it as PKCS12 PFX and could sign EXE, DLL, ... as promised.p  pNow... I tried to import this PFX into Java with keytool, then I tried to sign a JAR. And it workedp  pAnd then there is the mysterious Software Publisher certificate as product. I dont know what I canshould sign with that... Mac Linux Isnt Microsoft Authenticode a Software publisher certificate too Isnt a EXE software That really confuses me.p  pSo, my question is now When I have ordered a Microsoft Authenticode cert, is it then illegal to use it to sign e.g. JAR files or if possible any other content There seems to be no technical difference between these certificates. All of those products should have the same codesigning EKUOID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3, which does not make any differences between EXE, JAR, Adobe Air and what the hell also exists around there. So, if all CodeSigning certificates are technically equal, why do I have to decide then if I want to be a Java Developer or Windows Developer or Software Developerp  pMaybe there are still differences in the certificate Maybe I get not enough rights in JARs when I use Authenticodecerts for signingp  pPS I do not use my software commerciallyp
Negative 30073 pI am attempting to write an app for the Android platform which is similar to a lot of code I have written in VB and C. I plan on using sensor data from the device and doing calculations on that data. I am still working a lot of this, but wanted to know since I was going to need access to the motion sensors of the phone, where would be a good place to start reading Specifically, is there some sort of predefined API, class or method already in place devoted to this Are there places where clear documentation can be found I am just trying to make sure I am not reinventing the wheel here.p  pGeneral Idea is to pull movement sensor data very rapidly, and calculate average moves or twitches of the phone while in use for a phone call. Obviously, when not on speaker phone. This data is collected for the length of the call at intervals, then sent to an offsite storage server where it is mapped for average, and peak movement patterns. This will then be used to generate visual patterns from the elderly or neurological patients with tremors. This is similar to Intels research on data from home phones, but applied with a targeted algorithm for discerning specific twitches and tremors from others over time, thus helping with diagnoses. p  pPlease be gentle. Thanks p

Negative 30073 pThe title is a bit confusing, so i will explain a bit more using examples. Just a note i am parsing a file format. Say we have a structure like thisp  precodestruct example     typeA a    typeB b    typeX x    typeY y    typeZ z  codepre  pSo far its ok. Now the problem is, that codetypeXcode, codetypeYcode and codetypeZcode can vary in size. Depending on flags in the file header metadata they can be either two or four bytes large. Another thing is, that there are several more structures like this about 40. Each of them use the codetypeXcode, codetypeYcode, codetypeZcode. Some all of them, some just one or two. And finally, most of them are optional, so there might be just four or five structures used, or 20 or 30...p  pI would like to know if anyone has some idea how to store such a varying set of data. I thought about using templates, but dont know if its the right way.p  pEDIT to clarify more memory is not a big issue, so i probably can afford wasting a bit of space. If typeX is four bytes then it is so for all structures. Hovewer they are not synced, so typeX can be 4 bytes, typeZ can be 2. Most structures might be used multiple times, so there can be 50 example1 structures, 10 example2 structures etc.p

Negative 30073 pWe have a custom panel class that animates its children via an internal DoubleAnimation object.  However, we want to expose the animations Duration dependency property as a public property of our panel so the user can change it in their XAML when using our panel.  But we dont want to expose any other part of the animation object, just the duration.p  pThe first thing that keeps getting suggested to me is to use the PropertyChanged notification, but that would only work for the setter, not the getter.  We also cant simply create a .NET property since XAML bypasses the .NET property altogether.p  pA coworker of mine had a clever idea... use twoway data binding between the outer property and the internal objects property, which actually seems like a pretty neat solution.

Negative 30073 pI am using ublasCompressed Matrix to work with UMFPACK, a sparse linear solver. Since I am doing a simulation, so every time the linear system is constructed slightly differently that might involve enlargingshrinking the coefficient matrix and some sparse matrix multiplications. The scale of the linear system is around 25k.p  pEven there is a binding patch for boost to work with UMFPACK, I still need to change the matrix from time to time, sometimes even figuring out the number of nonzero values would be timeconsumingideally, I have to give the number of nonzero values when I initialize a matrix. Also, I use ublasrange to append columnsrows dynamically.p  pSo my question is is there any efficient way to do this Right now its too slow for me. Transposing a matrix with dimension like 15k costs nearly 6s and appending about 12k rows is fastbecause I guess its a rowmajor matrix, but appending the same number of columns to the matrix can cost up to 20si guess for the same reason as above, so even I used a columnmajor matrix the total time required would be the same.p  pKinda getting desperate here. Any suggestion is welcome.p  pCheers.p

Negative 30073 pIm having an interesting problem trying to sign a SAML2 Assertion using IBMs JRE 6.0. If I run the code under a Sun JDK, it signs the assertions correctly and the signature verifies. If I run the exact same code under the IBM JRE, the Assertion is created correctly, but the signature wont verify. Again, this is the same code, indeed, as its running from Jetty, its the exact same Jetty config and WAR file as well. I have two instances of Jetty running on different ports with different JREs but pointing to the same Jetty home. The signatures generated under the Sun JRE validate, but those generated under the IBM JRE do not. Im frankly stumped and am running out of things to try, so any suggestions would be helpful.p

And someone branching from the branch for a patch release could have easily missed the tag and pulled codeC gt Dcode in to their new branch as well.li ol

When the user clicks for undo, the last inserted valuepath will be deleted and the next path will be quired.

Negative 30073 pIve done a lot of WPF and am now, for the first time, trying to get a grasp of Qt, so far fairly successful.p  pHowever, in WPF, Im used to encapsulate selfenclosed parts of GUIs in User Controls so that I can then easily reuse them across dialogs or rearrange an entire block without having to touch every single element. If, for example, I was building a main window that would show information about a hospital, about the area it is in and about its manager, I would encapsulate each of the three blocks in a User Control and my main window would just contain three instances of those controls.p  pWith Qt, I was as yet unable to identify the concept I should use for this type of encapsulation. Should I be casting those building blocks as custom widgets My guess is that Qt has a concept for that which I cant find because I dont know what its called.p  pThanks for your helpp  pFSp

Negative 30073 pWe have a computationally intensive service which is used to do a number of transformations. Its largely computationally bound CPU bound process. Essentially what happens is we have a message broker which sends messages to the processing service via Thrift.p  pNow we have multiple different processing services which run different algos to do processing on the messages  these messages are routed to one or more processing algos. Our message volumes are variable and so are the needs of the processing algos i.e. we can get many messages that contain XYZ then send to algo 1 otherwise send to algo 2. p  pWe would like to expand this into something that is horizontally scalable. So we have multiple nodes which are running the processing algos. Now depending on the messaging loads our Thrift requests should be sent to different servers assume that all services are running an instance of each processing Algo1 to 3. Say for example we are getting a large number of messages which we want to process on Algo 1 then we have two servers running algo 1 and the 3rd server looks after requests for the other two algos Algo 2 amp 3. p  pSo the system looks like thisp  precodeClient Request                               Coord amp Load Balancer Service  ... like zookeeper                                       ltgt                              Route messages to servers...

Negative 30073 pIm using Storyboard in full screen on Lion with Xcode 4.2 .

However, double clicking the controller zooms in beyond the point of controller fitting the screen, making positioning the new component nigh on impossible. Zooming out loses the controller focus and prevents adjustment of the new component.li liAdding a new view controller to the Storyboard makes all controllers, including the new one, disappear from view. They can only be made to appear onebyone by left clicking their View in the Storyboard components list on the left.li ol  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI actually solved this one before finishing writing the question  but thought Id post for others.p  pIt seems these bugs arise when you have the Storyboard open in two separate Xcode windows. Id left clicked the storyboard once in my main Xcode window so it loaded there, then I doubleclicked it to load in a new, separate window. With the original window open these bugs arise. However, as soon as one of the windows is closed, all issues disappear.p

Negative 30073 pIve been trying to fix these two bugs for a while and I feel like it has to do with a fundamental misunderstanding of what happens when I open up a new activity. Basically the program is a task management program. It works fine when I add new tasks without modifying the category, and the database updates fine and the main page of the application updates as I add new tasks to display these new tasks.p  pHowever, I recently added functionality for an add categories button. The purpose of this button is to open up a new listactivity that allows users to add new categories of tasks. Every time I open this from the task editing activity and then press the back button to get back to the main page, all of the tasks in the database get cleared. Wondering if anyone can tell me whats going on and why the data is getting wiped out.p  pheres the relevant code snippet from the front page the list view showing all of the tasksp  precodeprivate RemindersDbAdapter mDbHelper   Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 30073 pThe first time I saw this was when I experimented with the Netbeans Framework. If for example you wanted to create a menu on a UI form you would create files whose filenames would correspond to a menu entry.  So for example if you wanted File, Edit and About in your menu you would create actual files with those names and place them in a directory.  Maybe that directories name was Menu.  So in other words the content of your application was derived from  directories, their names and structure and the files that sit in them but not necessarily the data in the files.  p  pSo fast forward to now...my boss wants me to model a hierarchical relationship between data...my first inclination was to model it using a DB but when he shared with me his design he had conceptualized it by using the presence of files in directories to model the relationships.  At first I was like this is highly irregular but then I recalled Netbeans so I couldnt tell him that it was crazy or unusual without being a hypocrite since I had seen it before.p  pIs there a name for this approach  I guess my interest in it at this point is purely academic.p  pThanksp
Negative 30073 pI am trying to create an app that would be compatible and working on all the platforms. For the development of my app I have chosen Phonegap. I have tested my code on iOS and Android and it works fine as I tested it on device as well weas emulator. But when I tested the same code on Blackberry using phonegap and blackberry webworks, running the emulator through command prompt on Windows, it doesnt recognise or execute the code i have written in the  tag. Basically I have various  tags with 23 javascript files included and thus it doesnt execute any of the scripts in it. So because of this interface, core functionality is lost and a blank screen is all I get. I have tested the simple Javascript alert function by putting it in page load event of body tag and it works fine.p  pCan anyone please tell me what could be the possible reason for this Please do help me out with this as I am not move forward because of this problem. Any help would be much appreciated. p  pCheers, Prajaktap
Negative 30073 pI have a script that attaches actions to some objects in my HTML code. Say, a textarea with a class of codewithcountercode that updates the number of characters being typed on it a list that listens when a codemouseovercode happens a link that is being ajaxified and so on.p  pe.g.p  precodetextarea.withcounter.keydownfunction    var textlen  this.val.length    manipulate the spanetc that has the counter  a.ajaxlink.clickfunction    var loc  this.attrhref    load the value of href via .ajax to some div    yadda yadda  codepre  pThe initial scenario is this A relatively small amount of HTML is loaded from the database and then actions are being attached to it implementing the code snippet above. Now, I have this script that loads another chunk of same format HTML. The newly loaded HTML should receive the same actions. p  pThe bottom line of the problem is I dont want to attach these actions to the objectselements that I have attached these actions before. As newer chunk of HTMLs are loaded, the slower this attaching of actions happen. The actions are being attached to the previously loaded HTML remember that they have these actions when what I want to happen is that the actions must be attached strongonlystrong to the newly loaded HTML chunks. There are times that FF freezes and will ask if I want to continue the script process.p  pErgo, the question Is there a way where I can opt to bypass attaching of actions to the elements that I have attached actions beforep  pA million thanks, everyone.p

Negative 30073 pI have two inputs that together form a single semantic unit think an hours and minutes input together forming a time input. If both inputs lose focus I want to call some Javascript function, but if the user merely jumps between those two, I dont want to trigger anything.p  pIve tried wrapping these two inputs in a div and adding an onBlur to the div, but it never triggers.p  pNext I tried adding onBlurs to both inputs and having them check the others focus attribute through jQuery, but it seems that when the onBlur triggers the next element hasnt received focus yet.p  pAny suggestions on how to achieve thisp  pEDIT Someone questioned the purpose of this.

Negative 30073 pId like to add the ability to adjust screen gamma at application startup and reset it at exit. While its debatable whether one should tamper with gamma at all personal I find it useless and detrimental, but hey, some people expect being able to do that kind of thing.p  pIts just one simple API call too, so its all easy, rightp  pMSDN says emThe gamma ramp is specified in three arrays of 256 WORD elements each [...] values must be stored in the most significant bits of each WORD to increase DAC independence.em. This means, in my understanding, something like codewordvalue  bytevalueltlt8code, which sounds rather weird, but its how I read it.p  pThe Doom3 source code contains a function that takes three arrays of codecharcode values and converts them into an array of codeuint16tcode values that have the same byte value embothem in the upper and lower half. In other words something like codewordvalue  bytevalueltlt8bytevaluecode. This is equally weird, but whats worse it is emnot the same as aboveem.p  pAlso there exist a few of code snippets on the internet on various hobby programmer sites apparently one stolen from the other, because theyre identical to the letter which do some obscure math multiplying the linear index with a value, biasing with 128, and clamping to 65535.

Negative 30073 pI have a hierarchy of stuff I want to display at the same time in both outline view and a custom view.  Sort of analagous to the Buck and Yacktman Cocoa Design Patterns example in CH. 29, but with Outline instead of Table.

Also found that for some reason all the canInsert and its relatives have value NO for some reason I cant find or find with google.  So so far, it appears that NSTreeController is little help in coordinating my two views.

Negative 30073 pSo basically i have a little application that loads two plugins and codeconnectcode them. First plugin after its loaded it creates a label without any title  which will be added to main window. Second plugin creates an action which will be added to a menu. So my app  need just to load these plugins and to codeconnectcode them . What i mean by connecting them  i mean that label plugin contains a slot which will modify labels title , and action plugin has a signal declared. Application should codeconnectcode action plugin signal with label slot. I do not know how to do it exactly. My guess is that in action plugin class  implementation is to connect custom   signal with a standart signal triggered. But anyway this ways my app is not working as i expected.

Negative 30073 pi am creating a rails application and there is a part that is causing me some trouble on the way i designed my code. I am feeling that im doing this a bit too messy and i would like to know if there is a design pattern or generally a better way to do this. The situation is like this p  pI have a City model and the city can store wood, stone and gold. Those resources are changing over time based on their timestamps. They have their own attributes like amount, changedtimestamp. p  pNow, i thought that creating 3 separate models like woodproduction, stoneproduction and goldproduction seemed like a good idea, seemed pretty adequate. I also created delegators and virtual attributes so that i can execute something like p  precodecity.wood or city.stone codepre  pHowever, the problems arise when i want to change the amount or timestamp for a specific resource type. Say that a building costs p  precodewood gt 200, stone gt 100, gold gt 50 codepre  pto be created. So say that the building is created and i now have to reduce the resources from the city.  This would need me to do something like p  precodeself.woodproduction.updateattributechangetimestamp, Time.now self.wood  v self.save codepre  pThe problem with this is that its resource specific. I would much more like to have a setresource method that carries on with the procedure without caring about the resource type without using ifs and more spaghetti.p  pHow would you do it p

Negative 30073 pIn C, I was told that if a container class such as ListT is first upcast to a container interface such as IEnumerable, and then subsequently iterated over using foreach then runtime garbage will be created. Also, even when fully downcast, I was told that iterating over CollectionT also creates references on the heap. I understand that this is a result of a virtual call to GetEnumerator which may return a reference or value type result.p  pInspection of the MSDN docs for values types clearly lists all enumerations as value type. If an enumeration consists of an enumerator list then arent these enumerators of value type as per the docs are they boxed or completely unrelated to each other but with similar names or something else entirelyp  pIm not sure how to unify these two statements and I was hoping someone could explain it to me more plainly.p  pThanks.p  pEDIT Question rephrased taking into account commentor suggestions on use of words such as never and unnecessaryp

Negative 30073 pIm developing a web application using jQuery Mobile on the client side and PHP amp MySQL on the server side. The application works great on desktop browsers like Safari, Chrome and Firefox. However, on the iPad  where the application is opened as a web clip from the home screen  the application performs much worse. Scrolling works fine, but tapping a link to load a page from the server goes very slow.p  pA recording of the iPads screen shows that for example after tapping it takes 0,3 seconds before the tapped element is highlighted and the loader is shown. After 1,0 second from the start the lower half of the opened page is renderedshown below the loader. It then takes another 0,6 seconds before the upper part of the page is shown, making the total time required to load the page 1,6 seconds. A video showing this process played at 25 of the original speed can be found a hrefhttpcl.ly1x1y1j0K1c3e1s1x162N relnofollowherea.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comNKkEp.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4uuhR.jpg altLoading processap  pI understand that loading a page over WiFi takes some time, but I do not understand why rendering the upper half of the page takes an extra 0,6 seconds. Assuming that the page is fully loaded after 1,0 second because the lower half of the page is already shown then, I think that takes pretty much time as well, because it only takes around 0,5 seconds on Safari on my Mac. But that might be caused my the slower processor in the iPad and the lag of the WiFi connection.p  pHopefully someone knows some client side optimisations to make the application perform or feel faster. I already disabled animations within jQuery Mobile and I will try to optimise the server side myself.p  hr  pMaybe these things are important to knowp  ul liAll pages I return from the server have a full codeltheadgtcode with multiple referenced stylesheets and scripts.

Negative 30073 pI would normally post this on nvidias developer forums but they are still offline from last months hacking. If anyone knows of another good community for these types of questions I would love to know about them.  p  pI am developing some software designed to test human vision. Right now I have two tests written one that presents a stereoscopic image using nvidias 3D vision v.2 glasses and another test that displays letters on the screen similar to the charts you see in an eye doctors exam room. My problem is the during the chart test the 3D vision is getting triggered and causing the screen to look dim. I can enable and disable the 3D vision through the nvidia control panel between running the different tests but that is a less then elegant solution. I am using DX9 and Visual Basic to develop my code. In order to trigger the 3D in the Stereoscopic test I am using the NVSTEREOIMAGESIGNATURE Method that is described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7377861nvstereoimagesignatureanddirectx1011nvidia3dvision titleNVSTEREOIMAGESIGNATURE and DirectX 1011 nVidia 3D Visionherea. Basically the method involves making a backbuffer that is twice the width of the screen plus an extra column of pixel data in the middle where you insert a special signature that tells the video card that it is a stereo image and the left half of the backbuffer should be displayed to the left eye and the right half to the right eye. I dont do any of that in my code for the Chart test but the 3d Vision is still getting triggered and I cant figure out why. Is there a way to tell the video card to temporally disable the 3d Vision functionality in the codep  pThanksp
Negative 30073 pThe issue Ive found is very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24046thesafaribackbuttonproblemthis questiona, except that Safari on desktops seems to have resolved the issue. Essentially, the issue is this when a client is browsing on mobile safari and the page executes a javascript function on pagea.html, then navigate to pageb.html, then press the back button to go back to pagea.html, the javascript function wont run when the client pressed the back button to come back to pagea.html. It will skip the javascript call.p  pIve tried the solutions mentioned in the link above, but nothing seems to work for mobile Safari. Has anyone else encountered this bug How did you handle itp

Negative 30073 pI have an application written in Java where I am accessing data from an SQL database. In a few particular scenarios I have the ability to Query the database for information or I could write code in java to obtain the data i need based off of objects that are in scope. My question is this, is it more efficient to use queries when possible or write java code to achieve what is needed. Maybe a specific scenario would help.p  pI have a scenario where I query the database in order to get a list. After that i write some JAVA code to select only one of those particular objects from the list. In this scenario i used java to establish the object i needed.p  pAn alternative would be to query the database and in my query join two tables together and only return the one object that is needed. In this scenario I would use a Querying language to establish the object i needed. p  pAny Tips or advice would be appreciated thank you. p

Negative 30073 p1 Subquery is a query within a query and as such must start with a FROM clause and end with SELECT or GROUP BY clause. But Im puzzled why dont we also consider as a subquery those nested statements that only have a FROM clause  thus they dont end with SELECT or GROUP BY .  p  pThe behavior of codefrom c2  in collection2code is very similar to the behaviour of a subquery, since it enumerates the entire codecollection2code for every codec1code element. Since their behaviours are remarkably similar, why arent statements such as codefrom c2  in collection2code also considered as subqueries  you could argue that a subquery returns a result, but same argument could also be said of codefrom c2  in collection2code, since it does get converted into a call to codeSelectManycode  p  precode    var query  from c1  in collection1                 from c2  in collection2                  select ... codepre  pthank youp

As it is now, when the user clicks this box, it successfully expands its width, but the box doesnt open until you click again, requiring 2 clicks. The first click expands, the second click opens the box allowing you to select an item. Its like the first click triggers the set width event, then stops everything else and forces the dropdown shut. Ive tried onclick and it does the same thing, adjusts the width but closes the dropdown until you second click.p  pHow can I stop this from requiring two clicks What is causing the dropdown to close when setting the widthp

Negative 30073 pWhen implementing a view similar to an codeABPeoplePickerNavigationControllercode, Im not able to sort the list very quickly. The native contacts app loads the list instantly. Im dealing with 4000 contacts, so keeping load times down is important. I cant use the codeABPeoplePickerNavigationControllercode because I need to do a lot of custom UI work.p  pI was using codeABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllPeoplecode, then placing the people in codeUILocalizedIndexedCollationcode sections using sectionForObject and then sorting the sections using codesortedArrayFromArraycode. For 4000 contacts, my time was about 8 seconds.p  pI then switched to using codeABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllSourcescode and for every source, codeABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllPeopleInSourceWithSortOrderingcode and just appending each sources contacts to the unsorted array, then using the same codeUILocalizedIndexedCollationcode technique. This dropped the time down to about 5 seconds, I guess since the sections were mostly sorted already.p  pIs there any way to improve on this Any techniques Im not aware of Can I somehow load an codeABPeoplePickerNavigationControllercode data source without the view and use that Or is there a faster sorting methodp  pThanks very much. p

Negative 30073 pIm in the initial stages of developing a companion application to an existing POS program.  Basically Im looking for pin pad like functionality.

Is there a way to Unreserve the keypad in Windows so its still a HID device, but not seen as a keyboardp  pPossible Solution 2 There are samples of keyboard hooks, but these wont work either as the keypad output will still go to the POS application.

As for the 2nd if statement, it simply echos You didnt fill in all of the categories if even one field was left empty in the form compared to the first if statement that echos the specific field that was left empty.Like if you could break down each set of coding for me step by step that would be great.

Negative 30073 pMy app needs to get synced with other app users on there own devices. I also want to support offline editing, that are synchronized to the other collaborative users when the user gets connected to the internet.p  pSo the User A changes while he is offline some data in ohter words he would update database entries or add new records to the database. When User A gets connected to the internet, all changes and new records are delivered to the other collaborative Users. So User B will get the changesupdates and can insertupdate them into User Bs local device database.p  pBut I need to ensure that the ids of the database entries are unique along the whole system. Therefore I need to use something like UUID.p  pMy question Is it a bad idea to use a UUID String  Varchar as primary key in a android sqlite database table instead of an integer that would be auto incrementedp  pI guess there would be performance issues by using strings a UUID has 36 characters as primary key.p  pI guess indexing uuids instead of integers takes longer comparing string vs. comparing integers. I also guess that when Im using UUID, every time a new database recordentry has been inserted the database needs to reindex the primary key column, since they primary key index is not in a sorted order anymore which would be when I would use integer auto increment primary key, because every future record is added at the end, because the new auto incremented primary key is always the greatest number so far, so the index will automatically be in sorted order. What i also need to do is JOINS over 2  3 tables. I also guess that comparing strings on JOINS instead of integer would slow down the database query.p  pHowever I cant see any other possibility to implement such a collaborative syncing system, so I must use UUID, rightp  pAnother possibility would be to use a integer auto increment primary key and to use a second column uuid. So to work on the users local device, i would use this primary key integer for JOINS etc., while I would use the uuid column for syncing with the other users.p  pWhat do you guys think about that approach or is it in your opinion to much work, since you wont expect a big significant performance issue by ussing UUID directly as primary keyp  pAny other suggestionsp

Negative 30073 pI developed a program and a module in this has lots of shape classes. Consider a shape class such as a rectangle that I have here and a codedrawcode function that is continously called from my class.p  precodevirtual void draw  ifState  HOVERING  State  CLOSED                    rec.drawplayerContainer gluLookAtlookAtPoint  else ifState  OPENING  glPushMatrix          glTranslatefTweenable3Dpos.x,Tweenable3Dpos.y,Tweenable3Dpos.z glRotatefTweenable3DxRotation,1,0,0                         glTranslatefTweenable3Dpos.y,Tweenable3Dpos.y,Tweenable3Dpos.z rectShape.drawTweenable3Dpos.x, Tweenable3Dpos.y, Tweenable3Dwidth, Tweenable3Dheight glTranslatefofGetWidth2, ofGetHeight2,0 glPopMatrix  else  setPositionvidPlayerFinalPosition rectShape.drawvidPlayerFinalPosition, vidPlayerFinalWidth, vidPlayerFinalHeight ofCirclevidPlayerFinalPosition, 30 ofVec3f looks0,0,0 lookAtlooks   codepre  pThe codeTweenable3Dcode used in the second is nothing but kind of interpolated values for my animations. I am doing animations of rotations, translations and others in such a way.brp  pThe catch here is that my shape is inside a camera at the beginning. For the second if condition I have to perform some animations as I wrote above. However, when I include a camera in my program, it messes up and translates the coordinates to center of the screen my initial coordinates are at top leftbrp  pI have to do my own translation to correct this camera translation or try world to screenscreen to world etc.br I was just wondering if theres way I could some how get this object out of the camera, do my animations and stuff and later in other if conditions also put it back in the camera when required. It might not be correct to say that the object is out of the camera probably some mathematical function already there would help in getting that effectp

Negative 30073 pThere are situations when an ajax request fails and there is no reason to make a new attempt to resend the last request, eg when getting an error code 404, 405 etc  because a new attempt will result always in the same.p  pBut in some situations as server busy, timeout, and others would can be interesting to have a routine that keeps trying to resend the request, and when it reaches a limit, display a message to the user if they want to stop the attempts  like in gmail when user have his connection lost.p  pBelow I have the beginning of what I need.p  precode.ajaxSetup    error functionmsg,e         console.warnmsg  Example NetworkError 405 Method Not Allowed ...       console.warne  Exception obj      codepre  pGenerically beyond busy server, timeout and what else case I could do a retry And if so, how I can get the error code and the last request from ajax URL, post data...p

The success call is happening like it should, that is not the problem. Through the use of the frame name I am trying to force the newly opened windowtab to get refreshed when the link is clicked more than once.

Any way to force this behavior in IE 9  Or even just an explanation of why this is occurring in IE 9 would be great  is it a user level setting  From what I can tell, IE9 just does not know what I am pointing it towards when I use the frame name in codewindow.opencode.p  pAnother thing I should mention  the code.focuscode does not always focus the window on secondthirdetc clicks seems to depend on browser and browser settings  but I have already asked that question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14650354isitpossibletoputfocusonframeaftertriggertoopenframeisinvokedaseherea  Just including it here in case it is relevant.p  pThanksp

Negative 30073 pHello I am trying to create an app that shows where you are in a facility. First I made it tell me my longitude and latitude. Then I made the background of the app a picture of the facility and made a symbol that went on top of the map that would later become the symbol that represents where you are but at first I just gave it random numbers to place it somewhere on the map to make sure it worked. Then when trying to enter the coordinates for the symbol it crashes and force closes as soon as the app opens.

Negative 30073 pI am writing some code that needs to be as fast as possible without sucking up all of my research time in other words, no hand optimized assembly.p  pMy systems primarily consist of a bunch of 3D points atomic systems and so the code I write does lots of distance comparisons, nearestneighbor searches, and other types of sorting and comparisons.  These are large, million or billion point systems, and the naive On2 nested for loops just wont cut it.p  pIt would be easiest for me to just use a codestdvectorcode to hold point coordinates.  And at first I thought it will probably be about as fast an array, so thats great  However, this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3664272stdvectorissomuchslowerthanplainarraysstdvector is so much slower than plain arraysa has left me with a very uneasy feeling.  I dont have time to write all of my code using both arrays and vectors and benchmark them, so I need to make a good decision right now.p  pI am sure that someone who knows the detailed emimplementationem behind codestdvectorcode could use those functions with very little speed penalty.  However, I primarily program in C, and so I have no clue what codestdvectorcode is doing behind the scenes, and I have no clue if codepushbackcode is going to perform some new memory allocation every time I call it, or what other traps I could fall into that make my code very slow.p  pAn array is simple though I know exactly when memory is being allocated, what the order of all my algorithms will be, etc.  There are no blackbox unknowns that I may have to suffer through.  Yet so often I see people criticized for using arrays over vectors on the internet that I cant but help wonder if I am missing some more information.p  pstrongEDITstrong To clarify, someone asked Why would you be manipulating such large datasets with arrays or vectors  Well, ultimately, everything is stored in memory, so you need to pick emsomeem bottom layer of abstraction.  For instance, I use kdtrees to hold the 3D points, but even so, the kdtree needs to be built off an array or vector.p  pAlso, Im not implying that compilers cannot optimize I know the best compilers can outperform humans in many cases, but simply that they cannot optimize better than what their constraints allow, and I may be unintentionally introducing constraints simply due to my ignorance of the implementation of vectors.p

But still I am not getting any products. Also I have tried to change the date active . But it is not showing any products. So can someone kindly tell me what is the issue here Any help and suggestions will be really appreciable. Thanksp
Negative 30073 pI would like to ask some help form You I have a project with a lot of C source. Most of them compiled with gcc, but some compiled with Intel compiler. This later codes have a lot of inline asm codes in Microsofts codeMASMcode format. I would like to compile the whole project with gcc and modify as few code as I can. So I wrote a perl script which converts the intel format inline asm to GAS format. BTW I compile to 32 bit on a 64 bit Linux machine.p  pMy problem that I have to specify for gcc that in the inline codeasm...code which C variables are passed to the code adding the code [var1] m var1, [var2] m var2, ...code line at the end.p  pIs it a way to avoid this explicit specificationp  pMy tryingsp  pThe dummy test C code is simply replaces 4 characters the destination char array with the elements of the source char array I know this is not the best way to do it. It is just a stupid example. p  pIn the original function there is no explicit specification, but it can be compiled with Intel compiler shame on me, but I did not test this, but it should work with Intel compiler as I made it based on the real code. codeLOOPcode label is used a lot of times, even in the same C source file.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  void cpchar pSrc, char pDst      asm               mov esi, pSrc         mov edi, pDst         mov edx, 4 LOOP         mov al, [esi]         mov [edi], al         inc esi         inc edi         dec edx         jnz LOOP           int main      char src[]  abcd     char dst[]  ABCD      cpsrc, dst     printfSRC s, DST sn, src, dst     return 0  codepre  pResult is codeSRC abcd, DST abcdcodep  pThe working converted codecpcode code is compiled with gcc. p  pGAS ATampT format compiled codegcc ggdb3 stdgnu99 m32 o asm asm.ccodep  precodevoid cpchar pSrc, char pDst      asm         mov [pSrc], esint         mov [pDst], edint         mov 4, edxnt LOOPnt         mov esi, alnt         mov al, edint         inc esint         inc edint         dec edxnt         jnz LOOPnt          [pDst] m pDst          [pSrc] m pSrc          esi, edi, edx, al       codepre  pIntel format compiled codegcc ggdb3 stdgnu99 m32 masmintel o asm asm.ccodep  precodevoid cpchar pSrc, char pDst      asm.intelsyntax noprefixnt     asm         mov esi, [pSrc]nt         mov edi, [pDst]nt         mov edx, 4nt LOOPnt         mov al, [esi]nt         mov [edi], alnt         inc esint         inc edint         dec edxnt         jnz LOOPnt          [pDst] m pDst          [pSrc] m pSrc          esi, edi, edx, al          asm.intelsyntax prefix  codepre  pBoth codes are working, but it needs some code modification inserting the  characters, collecting the variables, modifying the jump labels and codejumpcode functions.p  pI also tried this versionp  precodevoid cpchar pSrc, char pDst      asm.intelsyntax noprefixnt     asm         mov esi, pSrcnt         mov edi, pDstnt         mov edx, 4nt     LOOPnt         mov al, [esi]nt         mov [edi], alnt         inc esint         inc edint         dec edxnt         jnz LOOPnt          asm.intelsyntax prefix  codepre  pBut it drops p  precodegcc ggdb3 stdgnu99 masmintel m32 o .asm.exe .asm.c tmpcc2F9i0u.o In function cp homeTAGVR20130311vrvrslicecodecsrc.asm.c41 undefined reference to pSrc homeTAGVR20130311vrvrslicecodecsrc.asm.c41 undefined reference to pDst collect2 ld returned 1 exit status codepre  pIs there a way to avoid the definition of the input arguments and avoid the modifications of local labelsp  pstrongADDITIONstrongp  pI tried to use global variable.

Negative 30073 pI am interested in utilizing lambda expressions to create a tree of property selectors.p  pThe usage scenario is that we have some code that does some recursive reflection on an object graph, and to limit the scope of recursion, were currently using Attributes to mark which properties should be traversed. i.e. Get all decorated properties of object, if that property is a reference type with decorated properties, repeat for each of those too.p  pThe limitation of using Attributes is that you can only place them on Types you control the source for. A tree of lambda expressions allows the scope to be defined on any arbitrary types public members. p  pIt would be handy to have a shorthand way to define these expressions, which reflects the structure of the object graph. p  pUltimately, Id love to have something like thisp  precodeSelectorltMyTypegt selector  new []          t gt Property1,         t gt Property2                          p gt NestedProperty1,                 p gt NestedProperty2           codepre  pRight now, the best I can do declares an instance for each node explicitly something like thisp  precodevar selector  new SelectorltMyTypegt      new SelectorNodeltMyType, Property1Typegtt gt Property1,     new SelectorNodeltMyType, Property2Typegtt gt Property2              new SelectorNodeltProperty2Type, NestedProperty1Typegtp gt NestedProperty1,         new SelectorNodeltProperty2Type, NestedProperty2Typegtp gt NestedProperty2     ,  codepre  pTheres nothing wrong with this code, but you have to write out the type arguments for each node explicitly, since the compiler cant infer the type arguments. This is a pain. And ugly.

Negative 30073 pI need to find out which thread currently owns the lock.  p  pIm writing a multithread server using ThreadPool that hosts independent application instances. When shutting down an application instance I call Monitor.TryEnter to either acquire the lock or timeout. If a timeout occurs I need to get which thread owns the lock so I can abort it. p  pIf there are no bugs in the applications I would never need to do this as each worker would lock and unlock the application instance on entry and exit to the application. But if there IS a bug, and for whatever reason the worker doesnt exit and is either deadlocked or stuck in an endless loop I want to be able to kill that thread and application instance, while letting the rest of my server live on. The application instance at this point is a lost cause.p  pSeems like a pretty straight forward requirement, but couldnt find anything built in to do it.p  pOne workaround would be to add a Thread member in the same context as the lock and have each thread update it as it acquires the lock. But that relies on everyone ALWAYS remembering to update it when a lock is acquired.p

Negative 30073 pFirst lets start off with I am writing a program in VB.net and have a database set up and everything works fine as of now. The program is user based and requires the user to log into the program and it will show them all of there user information, orders, settings, fees etc,  etc... and everything that is needed. The issue I have is right now I have each user set up with a different database. I have the user login and connect to a database that just holds the Users and initial program start up settings. Along with this it loads the users database address and password into the program so I can then access there database and pull from all the tables relating to them. p  pI feel that having a database for each user is a bit overboard but each database pertains to the specific person and the information can be sensitive including address, amount of money made, and many other things so I dont know how to set it up to be most productive because if i have 50 users I dont want to create 50 databases. p  pPlease help with this. Even if you just point me to several places to read and learn I would love that. p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 30073 pI just upgraded my app from CakePHP 1.3 to 2.3. The upgrade console is far from perfect, but after a day of debugging, Ive solved most of the issues.

One example in line 1 of a function in a controller, SESSION[key] gives me an empty array, in line 10 it will give me a nicely populated array, and in my view its empty again. Extremely frustrating.

Negative 30073 pI have an MVC application in PHP.  My M includes Domain Objects, Factories and Mappers.

I would use the Factories to supply default values as one of their tasks.p  pAs a side point is there any terminology to distinguish between new entities, versus those that are retrieved from the database  I dont like using new, since the new keyword precedes all object instances, even those based on data retrieved from the database.p

The source posted there using a BG image created in memory looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZTyPM.png p  ul liThe BG image is on the left.li liThe FG image a PNG with transparency is in the middle.li liThe combined image is on the right.li ul  pSo far, so good.  But then the person who asked the question commented that if the BG was a JPEG, it failed. Thinking they were mistaken, I altered my example to encode the BG image to a JPEG.  Now if I use codeBufferedImage.TYPEINTARGBcode or codeBufferedImage.TYPEINTRGBcode for the final image I get what they were referring top  h2codeTYPEINTARGBcodeh2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfny1I.png altCombined image using a final image that supports transparencyp  h2codeTYPEINTRGBcodeh2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comT0kFs.png altCombined image using a final image that does not support transparencyp  pI expected the result to be the same as the original for at least one of those more so the codeARGBcode variant.p  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.image.BufferedImage import javax.swing. import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream import java.net.URL import javax.imageio.ImageIO  class CombineImages       public static void mainString[] args          Runnable r  new Runnable               Override             public void run                  try                      URL urlImage1                          new URLhttpi.stack.imgur.comT5uTa.png                       Load the FG image                     Image fgImage  ImageIO.readurlImage1                     int w  fgImage.getWidthnull                     int h  fgImage.getHeightnull                      Create a nontrasparent BG image                     BufferedImage bgImageTemp                              new BufferedImagew,h,BufferedImage.TYPEINTRGB                      ByteArrayOutputStream baos                          new ByteArrayOutputStream                     ImageIO.writebgImageTemp, jpg, baos                     ByteArrayInputStream bais                          new ByteArrayInputStreambaos.toByteArray                     BufferedImage bgImageJpeg  ImageIO.readbais                      int result  JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog                         null,                         Use a final image with transparency,                         Transparency,                         JOptionPane.YESNOOPTION                      int type  resultJOptionPane.OKOPTION                          BufferedImage.TYPEINTARGB                          BufferedImage.TYPEINTRGB                       Create the final image                     BufferedImage finalImage                              new BufferedImagew,h,type                     Graphics2D g  finalImage.createGraphics                     g.drawImagebgImageJpeg, w, h, null                     g.drawImagefgImage, w, h, null                     g.dispose                      JPanel gui  new JPanelnew GridLayout1,0,5,5                      gui.addnew JLabelnew ImageIconbgImageJpeg                     gui.addnew JLabelnew ImageIconfgImage                     gui.addnew JLabelnew ImageIconfinalImage                      JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, gui                  catch Exception e                      e.printStackTrace                                                SwingUtilities.invokeLaterr       codepre

This 2nd script also contains an additional call to send me a test notification.p  pSo all told, with these two scripts setup and scheduled, my iOS devices should get a total of 3 push notifications every 15 minutes. I have them timestamped as well so that they show when the notification was sent from the server.p  pHowever, when I run these scripts either manually or just let them run on their own every 15 minutes, I almost never get all of the notifications. Sometimes I get none. Sometimes I only get the first test notification. Sometimes I get the first test notification, the real notification, but not the 2nd test notification which should have been sent by the exact same code that sent the real notification.p  pI have checked the logs on the portal and there are no errors coming back from APNS. I know the logging is working as Ive seen errors for invalid device tokens in the past.p  pI should also state that Ive sent these devices push notifications via APNS using a simple C application with absolutely no problem.p  pCan anyone give any suggestions or see what I may be doing wrong I have an app waiting to be reviewed and would love to get this issue taken care of.p

Negative 30073 pMy question is exactly as the Title says How would one go about creating and update profile page on a websitep  pCurrently, I store the users userid, username, and email after a successful login in SESSION variables.

The codeprocessupdateprofile.phpcode needs the SESSION stored userid in order to update that specific users row in the Users table in my Database.p  pHowever, when I print out the SESSION userid variable, it returns NULL, and the SQL query doesnt execute because the codeWHERE useridcode statement in my prepared statement fails. p  pThis is the code that starts the session at the top of my pagep  precode        function secsessionstart              sessionname  secsessionid  Set a custom session name             secure  false  Set to true if using https.             httponly  true  This stops javascript being able to access the session id.               inisetsession.useonlycookies, 1  Forces sessions to only use cookies.              cookieParams  sessiongetcookieparams  Gets current cookies params.             sessionsetcookieparamscookieParams[lifetime], cookieParams[path], cookieParams[domain], secure, httponly              sessionnamesessionname  Sets the session name to the one set above.             sessionstart  Start the php session             sessionregenerateidtrue  regenerated the session, delete the old one.               codepre  pAnd this is the code that stores the userid in a SESSION variable when the user logs inp  precodeuserid  pregreplace[09], , userid  XSS protection as we might print this value SESSION[userid]  userid  username  pregreplace[azAZ09 ], , username  XSS protection as we might print this value SESSION[username]  username codepre  pThanksp
Negative 30073 pI have a sheet which looks up a database which has paths to all available images for a certain code. What I want to do is when the user types in a code into the excel spreadsheet, it creates a button to the right of the table on the same row easy enough but then clicking that button brings up the user form. On this userform, I am wanting to list all the images on the database that match that code. Some codes may have 1 image and some as many as 5. I also want each of these labelled 1 to x with x being the final image.p  pOnce I have that, I want to be able to either have a user click one or more images to add them to the excel sheet by number reference, so if a user clicks 1, 3 and 4 I want it to put 1, 3, 4 in the cell next to the code. Either that or I may just have them click cancel and manually put in the numbers.p  pIs what I am wanting possible How would I go about it I have absolutely zero experience with User Forms in VBA but really want to see what they are capable of.p  pThanksp  pBenp

Negative 30073 pI have a Task object which has to undergo several processing. The process has many subprocesses taking Task from the input queue, process them and place them in a output queue for the next subprocess. The process has multiple processing path, and hence multiple exit points. I need some kind of tracking mechanism to find out, processing of an Task object is completed. For this, I have added a TaskWatch, which keeps the Task Id and waits for notification from the exit points. Each exit point, after completing its process, has to send a notification explicitly. Is there any way  mechanism  pattern through which each exit point intimates the TaskWatch about the completion. I am implementing it in Java.p

For a nonexistent address, codeconnectcode blocks for a while then returns code1code, and codeerrnocode is codeETIMEDOUTcode.p  pFrom the docs, if the server rejects the connection attempt I would expect codeconnectcode to return code1code and for codeerrnocode to be codeECONNREFUSEDcode or perhaps codeECONNRESETcode.

However, if I only specialize the twoargument version, then I run into the following problemp  pcodestdcommontypeltint, unsigned, boundedintegerlt0, stdnumericlimitsltunsignedgtmax  1gtcodep  pshould give mep  pcodeboundedintegerltstdnumericlimitsltintgtmin, stdnumericlimitsltunsignedgtmax  1gtcodep  pHowever, it does not. It first applies commontype to codeintcode and codeunsignedcode, which follows the standard integral promotion rules, giving codeunsignedcode. Then it returns the result of codecommontypecode with codeunsignedcode and my codeboundedintegercode, givingp  pcodeboundedintegerlt0, stdnumericlimitsltunsignedgtmax  1gtcodep  pSo by adding codeunsignedcode to the middle of the parameter pack, even though it should have absolutely no impact on the result type its ranges are entirely contained within the ranges of all other types, it still affects the result. The only way I can think of to prevent this is to specialize codestdcommontypecode for any number of builtin integers followed by codeboundedintegercode, followed by any number of builtin integers or codeboundedintegercode.p  pMy question is how can I do this without having to approximate it by manually writing out an arbitrary number of parameters followed by a codeboundedintegercode followed by a parameter pack, or is this not possiblep  pEDIT 2p  pThe reason that commontype will give the wrong values can be explained by this reasoning following the standard quoting from N3337p  pThe codecommontypecode of codeintcode and codeunsignedcode is codeunsignedcode.

Negative 30073 pEDIT  This is about doing Continuous Delivery with Maven and having it orchestrated with Jenkins.  Maven is definitively not designed for that, and this question is part of our effort to get an efficient workflow without using Maven releases.  Help is appreciated.p  hr  pWe use Maven SNAPSHOTs within major versions to ensure customers always get the latest code for that given version, which works well.  For technical reasons we have two independent Maven jobs  one for compiling sources to jars, and one for combining the appropriate jars to a given deployment.  This also works well.p  pWe then have Jenkins orchestrating when to invoke the various steps, and this is where it gets a bit tricky, because if we do the normal codemvn clean installcode in step one, this means that all the snapshot artifacts get recompiled, which in turn makes Jenkins think that all the snapshots emchangedem as their fingerprint  aka MD5 checksum  changed even if the sources used to generate the artifacts did not change, triggering emallem the downstream builds instead of just those which dependencies emdidem change.p  pI have so far identified these things as varying between buildsp  ul liMETAINFmaven...pom.properties as it contains a timestampli liMETAINFMANIFEST.MF  contains JDK and userli litimestamps in jar fileli ul  pI have found ways around the two first, but the latter is a bit more difficult.  It appears that AbstractZipArchiver which does all the work in zipFile and zipDir is not written to allow any kind of extension to how the archive is being generated.p  pFor now I can imagine four approaches but more ideas are very welcomep  ul liCreate a derivative of the current mavenjarplugin implementation allowing for a codetimestampltnumbergtcode attribute which is then used for all entries inserted into the jar file.  If not set, the current behavior is kept.li liRevise the Jenkins fingerprinting scheme so it knows about jar files and only looks at the entries contents, not their metadata.li liAttach a plugin to the codepreparepackagecode stage responsible for codetouchcodeing the files with a specific time stamp.  This requires all files to be present at that time meaning that the jar plugin cannot be allowed to touch the MANIFEST.MF fileli liAttach an extra plugin to the package phase which rewrites the finished jar file, zeroing out all zip entry timestamps in the process. li ul  pAgain, the goal is to make maven SNAPSHOT artifacts fully time independent so given the same source you get an artifact with the same MD5 checksum.  I also believe, however, that this could be beneficial for release builds.p  pHow should I approach thisp

Negative 30073 pHere is my problem Im developing a Chrome extension for Gmail and needs to apply some changes when the extension is updated.p  pFor example, I want to be sure that the extension will display an alert dialog within Gmail after the extension has been updated. This implies to check whether Gmail is already open in a Chrome window at the time of the update, and if not to create a listener in order to wait for Gmail to be loaded in the future and then to display the alert dialog. p  pThe code below does just that.

Negative 30073 pI am investigating the pubsub pattern because I am reading a book that highly advocates event driven architecture, for the sake of loose coupling.  But I feel that the loose coupling is only achieved by sacrificing readabilitytransparency.p  pIm having trouble understanding how to write easilyunderstood pubsub code.  The way I currently write my code results in a lot of onetoone channels, and I feel like doing so is a bad practice.p  pIm using require.js AMD modules, which means that I have many smallersized files, so I feel like it would be very difficult for someone to follow the flow of my publishes.p  pIn my example code below, there are three different modulesp  ol liThe UI  Controller module, handling user clicksli liA translator moduleli liA data storage moduleli ol  pstrongThe gist is that a user submits text, it gets translated to english, then stored into a database.strong  This flow is split into three modules in their own file.p  precode Main Controller Module define[pubSub] functionpubSub       submitButton.onclickfunction          var userText  textArea.val         pubSub.publishuserSubmittedText, userText          Translator module define[pubSub] functionpubSub       function toEnglishtext           Do translation         pubSub.publishtranslatedText, translatedText           pubSub.subscribeuserSubmittedText, toEnglish      Database module define[pubSub] functionpubSub       function storetext           Store to database           pubSub.subscribetranslatedText, store   codepre  pFor a reader to see the complete flow, he has to switch between the three modules.  But how you would make clear where the reader should look, after seeing the first codepubSub.publishuserSubmittedText, userTextcodep  pI feel like publishes are like a cliff hanger, where the reader wants to know what is triggered next, but he has to go and find the modules with subscribed functions.p  pI could comment EVERY publish, explaining what modules contain the functions that are listening, but that seems impractical.  And I dont think that is what other people are doing.p  pFurthermore, the above code uses onetoone channels, which I think is bad style, but Im not sure.  Only the Translator modules codetoEnglishcode function will ever subscribe to the pubSub channel codeuserSubmittedTextcode, yet I have to create the new channel for what is basically a single function call.  While this way my Controller module doesnt have to have Translator as a dependency, it just doesnt feel like true decoupling.p  pThis lack of function flow transparency is concerning to me, as I have no idea how someone reading such source code would know how to follow along.  Clearly I must be missing something important.  Maybe Im not using a helpful convention, or maybe my publish event names are not descriptive enoughp  pIs the loose coupling of pubsub only achieved by sacrificing of flow transparencyp

Ill do my best to explain how it is to be constructed here.p  pThe Graph type should be isomorphic to the followingp  precodedata Graph e v  Graph vertices  [v], edges  [e, v, v]  codepre  pWhere codeecode is the edge type, and codevcode is the vertex type, we include a list of vertices and a list of edges along with the vertices they connect.p  pWhat Im envisioning is a monad instance of this type as followsp  precodeinstance Monad Graph e where   return v  Graph v []   Empty graph with one vertex   m gtgt f    see below  codepre  pI have an idea of how to implement codegtgtcode which basically takes each vertex, maps it to a new graph, and then reconnects the vertex which built each graph correspondingly based on how the original graph was connected.p  pFor example, consider a function codefcode which takes a vertex and produces the complete graph on two vertices codeK2code from it. Then if we bound codeK2code itself to codefcode, wed get something likep  precodeAB      C    D codepre  pwhere the graph codeABcode was the original, and the graphs codeACcode and codeBDcode were produced from codeAcode and codeBcode respectively. In the end, codeAcode and codeBcode need to be connected since they were connected in the original graph. Note that codeAcode and codeBcode need not be emexactlyem the same, but they need to directly map to something in the new graph. Im leaving out some information for simplicity what are the edges of the graph, etc, but the main point Ive noticed is that for this to actually work as a codeMonadcode instance, codeAcode needs to be directly mapped to a vertex in codef Acode, and the same goes for codeBcode. In general, each vertex in the original graph needs to be mapped directly to a graph in the graph resulting from codefcode. p  pIf Im understanding correctly, this means that a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiRetract28categorytheory29 relnofollowstrongcodefcode must be a retraction for some other morphism codegcodestronga. If it is, we can clearly join the graph by connecting each morphed vertex in its resulting graph to the morphed vertices in the others, producing a new graph of the type we want.p  pMostly this is just an idea I had, but I really wanted to if there is any way to, in Haskell, emrequireem that codefcode be a retraction Is there a way to state this within the confines of the language in order to supply an appropriate instance of codeMonadcode for a graph, or to do this, must I say this is really only a monad if the function youre binding to is a retraction I suspect the latter, but I just wanted to check.p  pAlternatively, I may be understanding everything wrong Feel free to correct me or give me some thoughts of your own.p

Negative 30073 pCurrently Im using Parse.com in order to create multiple ParseUsers. This works perfectly and each user can login individually. However from here I want to expand my app to allow Users to create groups of users and therefore have data that is only relevant and shared between these Users. This will mean that when the User logs in, they can see a List of the groups they are members of and from there can share data simply just to those users of that individual group. What would be the best way to tackle this and does anybody have any examples or tutorials that I could follow in order to understand this conceptp  pIve considered creating a Group class and then making this store Users IDs in an array and then allow each User to store an array of the Group IDs that theyre currently members of. Im just not really sure how to broach this issue.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 30073 pI am trying to get an OpenGLbased rendering engine that relies on OpenGL 3.3 and GLSL 3.3 to run on Ubuntu 13.10 using an AMD Radeon 6950. I want to use the open source drivers coderadeoncode, which rely on Mesa for their OpenGL implementation. Ubuntu 13.10 only provides Mesa 9.2 implementing OpenGL 3.1 out of the box. It is however possible to install Mesa 10.1 implementing OpenGL 3.3 from a hrefhttpslaunchpad.netoibafarchivegraphicsdrivers relnofollowthis PPAa as explained in this threadp  pStackOverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14123895openglglsl33onanhdgraphics4000underubuntu1204OpenGL amp GLSL 3.3 on an HD Graphics 4000 under Ubuntu 12.04ap  pI used the exact same steps as explained therep  precode1. Add the PPA Repository    sudo addaptrepository ppaoibafgraphicsdrivers 2. Update sources    sudo aptget update 3. Distupgrade rebuilds many packages    sudo aptget distupgrade 4. Then I rebooted. codepre  pMesa 10.1 was successfully installed. However, codeglxinfocode, while it now reports that Mesa 10.1 is in use, still reports only OpenGL 3.0 compat profile and OpenGL 3.1 core profilep  precode glxinfo  grep OpenGL OpenGL vendor string X.Org OpenGL renderer string Gallium 0.4 on AMD CAYMAN OpenGL core profile version string 3.1 Core Profile Mesa 10.1.0devel git7f57408 saucyoibafppacuraga OpenGL core profile shading language version string 1.40 OpenGL core profile context flags none OpenGL core profile extensions OpenGL version string 3.0 Mesa 10.1.0devel git7f57408 saucyoibafppacuraga OpenGL shading language version string 1.30 OpenGL context flags none OpenGL extensions codepre  pWhy is that How can I enable OpenGL 3.3 As can be seen by comparison in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14123895openglglsl33onanhdgraphics4000underubuntu1204the StackOverflow threada that I mentioned, it is possible to have codeglxinfocode report OpenGL 3.3. I am aware that codeglxinfocode may report the wrong version numbers as per a hrefhttpwww.mesa3d.orgrelnotes10.1.html relnofollowthe Mesa 10.1 Release Notesa, however emthe rendering engine Im trying to run fails because of thisem.p  pI use the following code to spawn a windowp  precodeglfwOpenWindowHintGLFWOPENGLVERSIONMAJOR, 3 glfwOpenWindowHintGLFWOPENGLVERSIONMINOR, 3 glfwOpenWindowHintGLFWOPENGLPROFILE, 0  ifGLTRUE  glfwOpenWindow     windowDimensions.x, windowDimensions.y,     0, 0, 0, 0, 32, 0, GLFWWINDOW      THROWGLFW error failed to create window.  codepre  pWhen I try to run the rendering engine using this setup, the above exception gets thrown as OpenGL 3.3 is not supported. I can set codeGLFWOPENGLVERSIONMINORcode to code0code and then the window opens fine, but an exception will be thrown later as GLSL 3.3 shaders are required.p  pAlso note that the rendering engine runs fine when I use the proprietary codefglrxcode drivers and then codeglxinfocode reports OpenGL version 4.2, so the application itself really is not the problem, but the supported OpenGL is.p  pSo what am I doing wrong Why doesnt Mesa 10.1 support OpenGL 3.3 for me My graphics card certainly supports it.p  pHeres some additional information that may be useful.p  precode aptcache policy libgl1mesaglx libgl1mesaglx   Installed 10.1git1402041945.7f5740curagagds   Candidate 10.1git1402041945.7f5740curagagds   Version table   10.1git1402041945.7f5740curagagds 0         500 httpppa.launchpad.netoibafgraphicsdriversubuntu saucymain amd64 Packages         100 varlibdpkgstatus      9.2.11ubuntu3 0         500 httparchive.ubuntu.comubuntu saucymain amd64 Packages    lspci vv ...snip... 0100.0 VGA compatible controller Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Negative 30073 pI am using SecureSocial for authentication in my project.  I have an issue which have been halfly answered on stack overflow, Whenever I refresh my project because of a file change,etc, I have to relogin. Below are the related questionsp  ol lipa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13179886securesocialfakeloginwhendeveloping1845576318455763Getting logged out of securesocial on compile and on clustered serversapli lipa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9205959gettingloggedoutofsecuresocialoncompileandonclusteredserverssecuresocial fake log in when developingapli ol  pOn both questions, this behaviour is blamed on the SampleUserService which is memorybased. I can understand that. In my case, I have implemented my own UserService, which persists user login information to a database I know it because on refreshing the project I dont have to reregister and only have to log in. This is pretty annoying and time consuming while developing. To overcome this, someone provided an answer for the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13179886securesocialfakeloginwhendeveloping1845576318455763second questiona as followsp  blockquote   pSecureSocial by default uses the default Play cache for storing authenticators that match the cookies to the logged in user. The default play cache is EHCache and its configured using the ehcache.xml that you can find in the jars. The default configuration is strictly in memory which means that when the app restarts, it loses all the values. Fortunately, its pretty easy to overwrite the EHCache configuration to write to the disk.p blockquote  pHaving said above, I have the following questionsp  ol lipSuppose that I leave the EHCache settings as they are, which means that in any app  refresh, a new login is required. Now, suppose that you have 500,000 users active and logged in on 10 different machine and you want to do a rollout. Does this mean that all my 500,000 will have to login again I dont think if reality is this, cause we had get logged out several times per week or month from facebook or linkedin etc,..., Can someone explainpli lipSuppose that I do what is mentioned above changing the default settings for EHCache. which means persisting the cache. Is this a rightgood way to go in production is it just a workaround for the problem mentioned while development and should not go on production. If it should not go on production, then I this right that all of my 500,000 will have to login againpli ol  pIf I am missing something please tell me. Maybe my questions rise from my lack of knowledge about secure social plugin. Thanksp

What currently happens is the PDF file will open up just fine, but the search terms are not being used.

It should also probably be noted that the Javascript function is kept in a separate Javascript File and is not inline in the aspx page. And yes, we are correctly referencing the Javascript file.

Negative 30073 pIm writing a little desktop app using wxPython that does a bit of image manipulation, but Im finding its running rather slowly. p  pOne of the biggest problems at the moment is that I am using three channels of data RGB where I only really need one  greyscale images are fine for my purposes.p  pAt the moment Im manipulating the images by loading them into a numpy array. Once the processing is done, theyre converted into a wx Image object via the codeImageFromBuffercode function, which is then loaded into a codeStaticBitmapcode for the user interface. This seems like a lot of steps...p  pSo I have two questions  the first is how would you load a numpy array directly into a greyscale wx Image Is this even possiblep  pThe second is more general  what is the fastest way of dealing with images in wxPython I dont have much choice but to loop over the numpy arrays I need the mathematical functionality, but any way of speeding things up before and after this process would be welcomep

Negative 30073 pI am trying to calculate battery charging or discharging rate. I use ACTIONBATTERYCHANGED to receive the event and I wait for minimum 1 change. Then I divide difference in battery level by difference in time milliseconds. I multiply the result by 1000  60  60 to show the rate in  per hour unit.

Negative 30073 pI am new to using AngularJS and wanted to integrate with Grails using REST.

From an authentication standpoint I thought that perhaps using the a hrefhttpgrails.orgpluginspringsecurityrest relnofollowSpring Security REST plugina might be helpful in passing a token as a parameter to the BookController assuming I override the index method.  I could then look up the token and filter results in the REST response.  Does this seem like the proper approach  Thank you for any feedback, p

Negative 30073 pId like to build a collection of String any complex data structure like a collection that I can use, efficiently, as example to know where I can split a given string.br In example I had this String collection  p  ul liabaco code, exchange.li libold word can be bold.li litree folder, and tree of leaf.li ul  pand a given string  p  ul liomecodeexchangeuthercanbetreeofwordli ul  pand obtain, from algorithm, something likep  ul liome code exchange uther can be tree of wordli ul  pThe part ome and uther cannot be splitted, so will be left as is it would be nice if I mark this part like NOTRECOGNIZED.

Negative 30073 pI am working through Programming in Scala and it says that you can override a parameterless method with a field, ad gives the following examplep  precodeabstract class Element      def contents Array[String]     val height Int  contents.length     val width Int  if height  0 0 else contents0.length   class ArrayElementconts Array[String] extends Element      val contentsArray[String]  conts   val a  ArrayHello, mom printlna0 val x  new ArrayElementa printlnx.contents printlnHello,   x.height codepre  pHowever this code produces a null pointer exception for me.  Replacing val contents with def contents works fine.  I cant really understand where the null pointer exception is coming from, if the contents array is indeed being correctly passed.  It seems to be coming from the val height  contents.length line, because replacing those with def height also runs correctly.  What am I not understanding about this examplep

Negative 30073 pI am trying to overlay the actionbar with a TextView everytime the user pulls down to refresh the list view that is displayed exactly the way the Gmail app or the reddit sync app do it. I am using a SwipeRefreshLayout for the refreshing, but I guess thats irrelevant. I have a class HeaderTransformer that holds the TextView and uses a WindowManager to attach the textView to the display. The instance of the HeaderTransformer class is called from within a fragment which holds the SwipeRefreshLayout and the ListView to refresh. On the very first creation of the fragment, the TextView overlay works perfectly. However, if I rotate the screen or somehow recreate the fragment, the WindowManager does not attach the TextView and raises a BadTokenException. p  pHere is some codep  h1Fragment Codeh1

anything to indicate anything out of the ordinary. All the resources Ive looked at have said to swap getApplicationContext for Activity.this. I think the source of the error is that HeaderTransformer is holding a reference to the activityview that was destroyedremoved on orientation change. I attempted removing any reference to the view or activity being held by the instance of the HeaderTransformer instance and changed all the functions to be passed mHeaderView as a paramater instead of a local variable. I still get the BadTokenException. p  pDoes anyone know what could be causing thisp

codeitemDetailcode are on separate scroll bars and i want them to be on the the same one so the details move with the codeGridViewcode.p  pMy first thought is to use Grouped codeGridViewcode, with a one item group that has a different item template the details template, though this seems like a long way round to solve a simple problem.p  pIs their an easier wayp  pDetailed Requirementsp  ul lipPage must fit as many Tasks items on it as possible hence codeGridViewcode.pli lipPage must make use of all space.pli lipPage must account for their being 1 task and many tasks.pli ul  pBased on these requirements, I must ensure that if there is only one task in the list, that details of the task fills the rest of the space on the screen so that there is not a load white space. Similarly, if there are lots of tasks, I must fit as many of them onto the page as possible, so the user can see them.p

You build a very complicated system. When you modify 1 record in table1, you need to keep track of the related record in table2. To keep track, you can do like thisp  pstrongOption 1strong When you modify a record in table1, you will try to modify a related record in table 2. This could be quite hard in term of programming expecially for a very very complicated system. p  pstrongOption 2strong instead of modifying a related record in table2, you decided to delete old record in table 2 amp insert new one. This is easier for you to program.p  pFor example, suppose you are using option2, then when you modify coderecord 1,2,3,....,100code in table1, the table2 will look like thisp  pre Table2 rID    textID 101    1 102    2 ... 200    100 pre  pThis means the strongMaxstrong of autoincrement IDs in table1 is still the same 100 but the strongMaxstrong of autoincrement IDs in table2 already reached 200.p  pwhat if the user modify many times if they do then the table2 may run out of records we can use codeBigIntcode but that make the app run slowerp  pNote If you spend time to program to modify records in table2 when table1 got modified then it will be very hard amp thus it will be error prone. But if you just clear the old record amp insert new records  into table2 then it is much easy to program amp thus your program is simpler amp less error prone.p  pstrongSo, is it good practice to keep 2 related tables using autoincrement PK to have the same Max of autoincrement ID when table1 got modifiedstrongp

Negative 30073 pI need to shear and skew some images using python. Ive come across a hrefhttpscikitimage.orgdocsdevapiskimage.transform.htmlskimage.transform.AffineTransform relnofollowthis skimage modulea but I dont seem able to understand exactly how Im supposed to use this.p  pIve tried a few things, which obviously gave me errors, because as I suddenly realized later, Im not passing in my image to the function. I then noticed that the function doesnt take my image as an input parameter in the first place. So how should the transformation be applied Or is this even the right function to be looking at in order to skew or shear an imagep
Negative 30073 pSomewhat new to C. Im going to try and explain my problem as best as I can. p  pIm having a hard time getting at properties that I have made on a custom tool. I have many of these tools on my GUI so its not as simple as just typing it out explicitly with the property. These controls are contained within a List and I want to be able to easily access their properties which is part of their isolated and separate solution project. Here is my example of what I have so farp  precodeListltControlgt controlList  new ListltControlgt private void btnStartClickobject sender, EventArgs e              foreach var item in controlList             if item.Enabled                    customcontrol1.Code  8917237            customcontrol1.MacAddress  000000000001                 do other stuff based on the above credentials    codepre  pId like to be able to do the following in my if statementp  precode   item.Code  ....  calculation    item.MacAddress  ....  this will increment in hex depending on how many controls I have Enabled codepre  pso that each instance of item has that custom control property that I can change with a for loop or something. Note each control tool item would have a different MAC and code based upon a calculation.p  pIm not sure how to implement this. I guess my main problem is Im able to see the default list of properties like Visible, Enable, etc... but not my Custom properties. Doing something like codecontrolList[0].Codecode also does not help me, because of the same issue. Im obviously misunderstanding something here.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p

For OAuth1.0 to 2.0 migration, as recommended in a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappsmarketplacev1migratev2 relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comappsmarketplacev1migratev2a we created a new version of our Gmail Contextual Gadget, published it in Google Apps Marketplace, and associated it with the old version.p  pNow, to the question the old version of the gadget was installed in about 50 domains. What happens to them after September, 30 Do they migrate automatically Or what do we need to do so that our users could continue using our gadgetp  pUPDp  pAs soitof pointed out, Step 4 of the migration guide suggests that we call PUT a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comappsmarketv2upgradableApplistingIDcwsIDdomain relnofollowhttpswww.googleapis.comappsmarketv2upgradableApplistingIDcwsIDdomainap  pYet, I am unsure about how to proceed from here. Namely, what the migration strategy should be.p  pThe first thing is that we dont keep the list of domains where our gadget is installed,  we only have the number of domains. I suppose we could track the requests and build that list. p  pHere comes the second point do we fire that PUT requests manually It is not difficult for our 50 domains, but what if there were, say, 10000 My wild guess would be that we make the old version of our app fire that PUT request automatically, but I am not sure if thats a good idea.p  pI would welcome some advice, best practices, guidelines etc. on how it is usually done.p

Negative 30073 pI am using Python 2.7.5 on a recent vintage Apple MacBook Pro which has four hardware and eight logical CPUs i.e., the sysctl utility givesp  precode sysctl hw.physicalcpu hw.physicalcpu 4  sysctl hw.logicalcpu hw.logicalcpu 8 codepre  pI need to perform some rather complicated processing on a large 1D list or array, and then save the result as an intermediate output which will be used again at a later point in a subsequent calculation within my application.  The structure of my problem lends itself rather naturally to parallelization, so I thought that I would try to use Pythons multiprocessing module to subdivide the 1D array into several pieces either 4 pieces or 8 pieces, Im not yet sure which, perform the calculations in parallel, and then reassemble the resulting output into its final format afterwards.  I am trying to decide whether to use codemultiprocessing.Queuecode message queues or codemultiprocessing.Arraycode shared memory as my preferred mechanism for communicating the resulting calculations from the child processes back up to the main parent process, and I have been experimenting with a couple of toy models in order to make sure that I understand how the multiprocessing module actually works.  Ive come across a rather unexpected result, however in creating two essentially equivalent solutions to the same problem, the version which uses shared memory for interprocess communication seems to require much more execution time like 30X more than the version using message queues.  Below, Ive included two different versions of sample source code for a toy problem which generates a long sequence of random numbers using parallel processes, and communicates the agglomerated result back to a parent process in two different ways first using message queues, and the second time using shared memory.p  pHere is the version that uses message queuesp  precodeimport random import multiprocessing import datetime  def genRandomcount, id, q      printNow starting process 0.formatid     output  []      Generate a list of random numbers, of length count     for i in xrangecount         output.appendrandom.random      Write the output to a queue, to be read by the calling process      q.putoutput  if name  main      Number of random numbers to be generated by each process     size  1000000      Number of processes to create  the total size of all of the random      numbers generated will ultimately be procs  size     procs  4       Create a list of jobs and queues      jobs  []     outqs  []     for i in xrange0, procs         q  multiprocessing.Queue         p  multiprocessing.ProcesstargetgenRandom, argssize, i, q         jobs.appendp         outqs.appendq       Start time of the parallel processing and communications section     tstart  datetime.datetime.now          Start the processes i.e. calculate the random number lists           for j in jobs         j.start       Read out the data from the queues     data  []     for q in outqs         data.extendq.get       Ensure all of the processes have finished     for j in jobs         j.join      End time of the parallel processing and communications section     tstop  datetime.datetime.now     tdelta  datetime.timedelta.totalsecondststop  tstart      msg  0 random numbers generated in 1 seconds     printmsg.formatlendata, tdelta codepre  pWhen I run it, I get a result that typically looks about like thisp  precode python multiprocqueue.py Now starting process 0 Now starting process 1 Now starting process 2 Now starting process 3 4000000 random numbers generated in 0.514805 seconds codepre  pNow, here is the equivalent code segment, but refactored just slightly so that it uses shared memory instead of queuesp  precodeimport random import multiprocessing import datetime  def genRandomcount, id, d      printNow starting process 0.formatid      Generate a list of random numbers, of length count, and write them      directly to a segment of an array in shared memory     for i in xrangecountid, countid1         d[i]  random.random  if name  main      Number of random numbers to be generated by each process     size  1000000      Number of processes to create  the total size of all of the random      numbers generated will ultimately be procs  size     procs  4       Create a list of jobs and a block of shared memory     jobs  []     data  multiprocessing.Arrayd, sizeprocs     for i in xrange0, procs         p  multiprocessing.ProcesstargetgenRandom, argssize, i, data         jobs.appendp       Start time of the parallel processing and communications section     tstart  datetime.datetime.now          Start the processes i.e. calculate the random number lists           for j in jobs         j.start       Ensure all of the processes have finished     for j in jobs     j.join      End time of the parallel processing and communications section     tstop  datetime.datetime.now     tdelta  datetime.timedelta.totalsecondststop  tstart      msg  0 random numbers generated in 1 seconds     printmsg.formatlendata, tdelta codepre  pWhen I run the shared memory version, however, the typical result looks more like thisp  precode python multiprocshmem.py  Now starting process 0 Now starting process 1 Now starting process 2 Now starting process 3 4000000 random numbers generated in 15.839607 seconds codepre  pMy question why is there such a huge difference in execution speeds roughly 0.5 seconds vs. 15 seconds, a factor of 30X between the two versions of my code  And in particular, how can I modify the shared memory version in order to get it to run fasterp

I tried tracking all RC and beta releases for 4.3.0.Final and 4.2.0.Final but failed finding such a mention.p  pWe are currently using Hibernate 4.2.12.Final and I wonder whether we could just start using java8 or whether we need to upgrade to a newer version of hibernate 4.3.x presumably.p  pFor some context, we are using TomEE as an application server. The 1.7.0 is just released with support for java8. However in case we must upgrade to hibernate 4.3.x, Im a bit afraid that we cant use Hibernate 4.3.x together with TomEE as Ive seen this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma15771969516188However, Hibernate 4.3 JPA 2.1 is not supported by TomEE, because its Java EE 7.a.

Negative 30073 pI have a large collection of data to display in a datagrid 1000 records. I want to have this grid to be responsive and lazy load the data with Angular bindings. The Application requirement does not allow me to use Pagination concepts.p  pThe TestPan, Results, Additional Info are clickable links which would display inline contents in the same row like detail row with variable heights.p  pI am not sure how to approach this kind of design inside a datagrid like using JQuery DataTables or Angular UI Grid. I am sure that it can be displayed using bootstrap table but number of bindings would be a problem doing it in Angular way with 1000 rows. Each row would have 50 properties.p  pI am not a designer and not sure how to attack it. Any expert direction would be helpful.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZvKUg.png altenter image description herep

The image spill over the containing div and the heading overlap the column1.p  pIf I remove the width attribute from the fimage, then the image fits inside the containing div .ffocus. But the problem is that, it affects the rendering in desktop browser. I can probably use two separate stylesheets for desktop and mobile. But then it would require a lot of rewriting and duplication and the styles would be scattered. More importantly, the logic of the layout is very simple  the image is 35 of the containing div. So if the containing div resizes in the mobile or any other screens, then the image should resize automatically. The fact that removing the width fits the image inside the containing div also bears testimony that there are enough room to accommodate the image. For the rest of things, ie the overlapping of the header with the column, I am not quite sure of the reason of it failing. p  pI am completely clueless. I even tried to debug the mobile version using firefox remote debugger. So please help me with resolving this. p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 30073 ul liIs it possible to split an OpenCV application into a frontend and backend modules, such that frontend runs on thinclients that have very limited processing power running Intel Atom dualcore processors, with 12GB RAM, and backend does most the computational heavylifting s.a. using Google Compute Engine  li liIs this possible with an additional constraint of the network communication between frontend and backend being not fast, s.a. being limited to say 128256kbps li liAre there any precedents of this kind  Is there any such opensource project li liAre there some common architectural patters that could help in such design li ul  pstrongemAdditional clarificationemstrongp  pThe frontend node, need NOT be purely a frontend, as in running the userinterface. I would imagine that certain OpenCV algorithms could be run on the frontend node, that is especially useful in reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to the backend for processing s.a. colourspace transformation, conversion to grayscale, histogram etc.. Ive successfully tested realtime facedetection Haar cascade on this lowend machine, in realtime, so the frontend node can pull some workload. In fact, Id prefer to do most of the work in the frontend, and only push those computation heavy aspects to the backend, that are clearly and definitely well beyond the computational power of the frontend computer.p  pWhat I am looking for are suggestionsideas on nature of algorithms that are best run on Google Compute Engine, and some architectural patterns that are tried amp tested, for use with OpenCV to achieve such a split.p

Negative 30073 pIve been working on an app on and off for a few months starting with the first XCode 6iOS 8 beta release. One of my favorite features added is live rendering, made possible with the codeIBDesignablecode tag in Swift.p  pI havent been able to get a single thing to live render. I figured that must have been because it was a beta release, so I decided to wait for the full release to come out to try again. It still failed. I figured then that there might be artifacts from the beta releases in my code, so I scrapped it and started fresh. It still doesnt work. Granted, the errors are slightly more descriptive now.p  pHere is my codep  precodeimport UIKit  IBDesignable class MyButton  UIButton       let UNPRESSEDCOLOR  UIColorred 221.0256.0, green 249.0256.0, blue 14.0256.0, alpha 1.0     let PRESSEDCOLOR  UIColorred 166.0256.0, green 187.0156.0, blue 11.0256.0, alpha 1.0     var buttonColorValue UIColor      let TEXTCOLOR  UIColorred 72.0256.0, green 160.0256.0, blue 5.0256.0, alpha 1.0      required initcoder NSCoder          self.buttonColorValue  UNPRESSEDCOLOR         super.initcoder coder          Initialization code         self.setTitleColorTEXTCOLOR, forState UIControlState.Normal         self.setTitleColorTEXTCOLOR, forState UIControlState.Highlighted         self.setTitleColorTEXTCOLOR, forState UIControlState.Selected           override func touchesBegantouches NSSet, withEvent event UIEvent          super.touchesBegantouches, withEvent event         buttonColorValue  PRESSEDCOLOR         self.setNeedsDisplay           override func touchesEndedtouches NSSet, withEvent event UIEvent          super.touchesEndedtouches, withEvent event         buttonColorValue  UNPRESSEDCOLOR         self.setNeedsDisplay           override func touchesCancelledtouches NSSet, withEvent event UIEvent          super.touchesCancelledtouches, withEvent event         buttonColorValue  UNPRESSEDCOLOR         self.setNeedsDisplay           override func drawRectrect CGRect          buttonColorValue.setFill         let ctx  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext         CGContextFillRectctx, rect         UIBezierPathroundedRect rect, cornerRadius 5.0.fill       codepre  pHere are the errors I get when I try to build with one of these buttons in my storyboardp  precodeIB Designables Failed to update auto layout status Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool crashed  IB Designables Failed to render instance of MyButton Rendering the view took longer than 200 ms. Your drawing code may suffer from slow performance. codepre  pAs you can see in my code, I originally wanted this button to be rounded. I figured this might be the reason for this problem, though it surprised me that Apple would design a rounded rectangle drawing algorithm that inefficient. I switched to simply setting the color and drawing the rectangle asis. Still had problems.p  pI figure I hope, anyway that there is one small thing that Im doing wrong, because Ive googled and there is no one else that seems to have this problem. Seems like it might be some kind of infinite loopp  pIts not something thats necessary for me to continue, but getting live rendering to work will make development a lot faster and easier for me, because I will be able to see my interfaces and test them without having to run them.p  pThanks in advance to anyone who has a remote clue on how to solve this.p
Negative 30073 pI am using Visual Studio 2013. Regarding TFS workflow, there are issues I have when working on a bug or work item, after I am finished, I move the changes into a shelfset for further review, undo my changes by right clicking on the pending changes and clicking undo.  The move on to the next issue or enhancement.  The shelfsets can be indpendendly reviewed and then applied to whatever branch they are currently needed.  p  pThe problem I have is that undoing through visual studio does not completely reset the solution to a completely clean state.  There are often orphaned files around or projects that have references to nonexisting files or other such problems.  Id like to be able to completely nuke and reset my solutions from source control as if I am a new developer and I have not found an easy solution to do this.  p  pCurrently, the only way I can accomplish this is to go to Source Control Explorer remove the file system mapping for the project.  Go to the file system, removed the folder.  Go back into Source Control Explorer add the mappings back in.  And then Get Latest Version.  p  pIs there an easy way to completely reset a solution in Visual Studio with TFS p

Negative 30073 pI am trying to write a program which reads a student number 7digit string from a file, replaces the first 3 digits with xs, and prints the result into a new file. I can accomplish what Im trying to do using a printf statement printing to the screen, but when using fprintf the result in the new file isnt what i want. Here is the relevant line of codep  precodestudentno1234567 fprintffp2, sbbbbbbbxxxt, studentno codepre  pin a codeprintfcode statement, the result is xxx4567, as intended. In an codefprintfcode statement, however, when i open the new file it displays 1234567xxx. Im really not sure why, as other escape sequences such as codencode or codetcode seem to work the same in codefprintfcode statements as they do in codeprintfcode statements. If anybody could point me in the right direction as to why this is occurring, that would be great.p

and everythings runs correctly smooth with one client connected. When I connect another client simultaneously on my localnote that em2 clientsem are connected machine the client1 that I first connected just stop working and the second clientemclient2em works well... Why it happens like this Why when I connect multiple clients it handles just the las one connected and blocks the other ones.Im sure that everything i coded its very well written and documented. I dont get it why this is happening...Note that Im connecting to the same IP address like .ClientSockExe 127.0.0.1 5432 .. Im wondering if this is the reason why its blocks the client 1 and client 2 works well, but.. i tried to connect to my application from another computer to the ip address that my other computer hosting the server and it cant connect .. why it happens like thisp

Negative 30073 pIve been diving into htmlcss over the past few weeks and am now trying to optimize my code with the DRY principle along with SMACSSOOCSSBEM. I believe I have a decent understanding of it all, but theres one thing thats still unclear to me.p  pShould the DRY principle be applied 100 of the time Lets say, for example, you have texttransform uppercase being applied to two different classes. According to the DRY principle, youd remove the rule set from each individual class and place it under a commaseparated list of both classes. But after awhile, doesnt this make your stylesheet a complete mess, where every class is being declared multiple times on the same sheet Or does it really not matter what your sheet looks like, since you could simply search for uppercase in the search box if any future changes were neededp  pIt seems that you wouldnt be getting any performance improvements out of this scenario. Yes, youd be removing one property from your sheet, but youd also be adding an entirely new rule set and repeating the class name.p  pI understand it could be done either way depending on preference and each project, but Im more concerned with what might be the most efficient way especially when it comes to building large, complex sites. Id like to stay consistent throughout all of my projects moving forward.p  pAre there any sort of guidelines to go off of For example, maybe only combining duplicate code if the amount of properties youre removing is greater than X Or only combining duplicate code when theyre related semanticallyp
Negative 30073 pI am writing a webpage that has a select html tag. The contents of the select object are populated by a php processor that taps into a database. The database will be large, around 10,000 hits. p  pLets say for example the database has people. Now everytime a person visits my page, the php will query the database, pull the 10,000 people and deliver a page to the client.p  pThe problem is that the database doesnt change that often and I would like a way to cache the 10,000 names on the client so that only when the database is updated that new data is sent to the client.p  pNormally html GET requests are cached anyways, but the problem here is that php generates a new file every time even though the contents are the exact samep  pHow can I store that data on the client side so that I dont have to transfer all those hits all the timep  pThanksp

Im using the standard Windows console rather than a terminal emulator like MinTTY in both environments, and Ive observed that when the beep occurs in Cygwin on Windows 7, it uses the systems ldquodingrdquo sound. This is consistent between all Cygwin utilities so Im guessing something must be fundamentally different in the Cygwin stack causing all system bells to behave this way.

Negative 30073 pFor displaying a google drive html document in an iframe, we first share the file Public on the web and take the documnet ID of it. Then this is appended to hosting linka hrefhttpsgoogledrive.comhost relnofollowhttpsgoogledrive.comhosta running this link on browser will display the output of the html file, instead of simply displaying the contents of that file and given as src to iframe tag.     But my requirement is not to share the file publicly, since it has sensitive information. We can set the permission of the google site in such a way that only specific people can access it. For that, the html file should still be shared publicly, which shouldnt happen in my case.    Also, in this case, appending document ID of the file whose permission is restricted to hosting link a hrefhttpsgoogledrive.comhost relnofollowhttpsgoogledrive.comhosta will give 404 error.

However, a modest speedup over the first example I could gain by using plain python3 with map and mulp  precodefrom operator import mul for j in range0,N     for k in range0,N         sump  cmath.exp1j  summapmul,x, [l  m for l, m in ziprp[j], rp[k]] codepre  pwith a runtime about code2.0scodep  pAttempts to either use an if condition to not calculate the case codejkcode, wherep  precodernp[j]  rnp[k]  0 codepre  pand thus the dot product also becomes 0, or splitting the sum up in two to achieve the samep  precodefor j in range0,N         for k in rangej1,N     ... for k in range0,N         for j in rangek1,N     ... codepre  pboth made it even slower.

Negative 30073 pOk, so a little background to what Im doing. Im developing an OS with a small file system. Its written in part assembler and part C. Im trying to implement hot keys to make the system cycle through colors, swap foreground and background colors, clear the screen completely, etc. Heres the function Im currently working withp  precodePRIVATE void mytoyshellu16t key  u32t color  0 char fgcolor, bgcolor, newcolor   Colors newcolor  0x2a fgcolor  0x0E bgcolor  0x10  switchkey      case CD         ctrld set default color          newcolor  0x1E         color  newcolor         clrscreencolor,NOFILL         break      case CS         ctrls swap bg and fg color          bgcolor  color amp 0xF0         fgcolor  color amp 0x0F         newcolor  fgcolor  bgcolor         color  newcolor         clrscreencolor,NOFILL         break      case CF         ctrlf  cycle fg color          iffgcolor  0x0F             fgcolor  0x00         else             fgcolorltlt         color  bgcolor  fgcolor         clrscreencolor, NOFILL         break      case CG         ctrlg cycle bg color          ifbgcolor  0x70         break      case CQ         ctrlq  reset          Clears screen         clrscreenIOTATTYCOLOR,FILLBLANK         displaywelcome         break       codepre  pFor now just to verify that the functions are working, Ive hardcoded newcolor, fgcolor, and bgcolor. CTRLD does its correct function, as well as CTRLQ. CTRLS is supposed to swap the foreground and background colors. This is where I become confused. In order to swap the current colors on screen, I was told to the color with 0x0F or 0xF0 depending on which value I wanted to obtain for either fg or bg. However Im not sure how to get the current color thats being displayed on screen. The default is yellow on blue 0x1E. I also found that when I tried the other colors, anything above a hex value of 8 will give me the colors for 07 but it causes the screen to blink. Using the bitwise amp and  should allow me to get the corresponding values I need to swap. However my problem is obtaining the current color on screen. Im not sure if this is something I need to try to find within my file elsewhere, or if there is something built into C that I could use to get those valuesp  pEDIT I figured it out. Turns out I had an attribute in another file that was imported into this file called codecolorattrcode which contained the current color.p

Negative 30073 pIm dual booting Windows and Arch with GRUB using MBR, and I recently shrunk part of my Windows partition codedevsda2code to expand my Arch root partition which used to be codedevsda3code. To do this, I created a new partition from the space I trimmed from the Windows partition and moved my Arch distribution to it. This partition was called codedevsda4code, although it actually occupied the sectors between the nowshrunken codedevsda2code and the old codedevsda3code. I then deleted the old Arch partition codedevsda3code so that I could expand codedevsda4code to include the rest of the space on my SSD so, codedevsda4code was expanded to include what used to be codedevsda3code. I reinstalled GRUB, and everything is working fine now except for the nagging issue that the partitions under codedevsdacode now have a gap.

Negative 30073 pMy Python application running on a 64core Linux box normally runs without a problem. Then after some random length of time around 0.5 to 1.5 days usually I suddenly start getting frequent pauseslockups of over 10 seconds During these lockups the system CPU time i.e. time in the kernel can be over 90 yes em90 of all 64 coresem, not of just one CPU. p  pMy app is restarted often throughout the day. Restarting the app does not fix the problem. However, rebooting the machine does. p  pstrongQuestion 1strong What could cause 90 system CPU time for 10 seconds All of the system CPU time is in my parent Python process, not in the child processes created through Pythons multiprocessing or other processes. So that means something of the order of 60 threads spending 10 seconds in the kernel. I am not even sure if this is a Python issue or a Linux kernel issue. p  pstrongQuestion 2strong That a reboot fixes the problem must be a big clue as to the cause. What Linux resources could be left exhausted on the system between my app restarting, but not between reboots, that could cause this problem to get stuck onp  h2What Ive tried so far to solve this  figure it outh2  pBelow I will mention multiprocessing a lot. Thats because the application runs in a cycle and multiprocessing is only used in one part of the cycle. The high CPU almost always happens immediately emafterem all the multiprocessing calls finish. Im not sure if this is a hint at the cause or a red herring.p  ul liMy app runs a thread that uses codepsutilcode to log out the process and system CPU stats every 0.5 seconds. I have independently confirmed what its reporting with codetopcode.li liIve converted my app from Python 2.7 to Python 3.4 because Python 3.2 got a new GIL implementation and 3.4 had the multiprocessing rewritten. While this improved things it did not solve the problem see a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions27810561whyismypythonappstalledwithsystemkernelcputime2969375629693756my previous SO questiona which Im leaving because its still a useful answer, if not the total answer.li liI have replaced the OS. Originally it was Ubuntu 12 LTS, now its CentOS 7. No difference. li liIt turns out multithreading and multiprocessing clash in PythonLinux and are not recommended together, Python 3.4 now has codeforkservercode and codespawncode multiprocessing contexts. Ive tried them, no difference. li liIve checked devshm to see if Im running out of shared memory which Python 3.4 uses to manage multiprocessing, nothingli licodelsofcode output listing all resource a hrefhttppastebin.com1nebcamY relnofollowhereali liIts difficult to test on other machines because I run a multiprocess Pool of 59 children and I dont have any other 64 core machines just lying aroundli liI cant run it using threads rather than processes because it just cant run fast enough due to the GIL hence why I switched to multiprocessing in the first placeli liIve tried using codestracecode on just one thread that is running slow it cant run across all threads because it slows the app far too much. Below is what I got which doesnt tell me much. li licodeltracecode does not work because you cant use codepcode on a thread ID. Even just running it on the main thread no codefcode makes the app so slow that the problem doesnt show up.li liThe problem is not related to load. It will sometimes run fine at full load, and then later at half load, itll suddenly get this problem. li liEven if I reboot the machine nightly the problem comes back every couple of days.li ul  pEnvironment  notesp  ul liPython 3.4.3 compiled from sourceli liCentOS 7 totally up to date. codeuname acode Linux 3.10.0229.4.2.el7.x8664 1 SMP Wed May 13 100609 UTC 2015 x8664 x8664 x8664 GNULinux although this kernel update was only applied todayli liMachine has 128GB of memory and has plenty freeli liI use numpy linked to ATLAS.

Negative 30073 pFirst, I want to apologize for not googling this properly, but im not sure how to even frame the question. ill try to google the title p  pThe problem I have is that some of my spark scala file, within the editor, report is not a member of problems, while the Problems view or the package explorer or the editors tab, dont see any problems at all.p  pThe issue occurs when I goto definition for some function or variable, then close the definition editor. I cant go back to the definition, since according to the editor, that function call now points to a nonexistant function. Everthing still works fine, compiles and no problems are reported as a whole. However, the function call now is underlined in red and there is the red X on the sidebar. In order to be able to goto definition again, I need to restart eclipse. Then the weird problem disappears, until I goto definition again. oOp

Negative 30073 pIm doing a query for a report, and I need help with the INNER JOINs Ive been trying to make work for weeks. Its apart of a larger report query, but I need help in this final part taht is supposed to filter certain results.p  pEach row in codecwoworkorderlineitemcode represents a item on a certain work order grouped together by transaction sequences. This query is joining this and another table for a report, codecatcustitemacctactivitycode. That table shows different transactions dealing with a certain account.p  pThis certain section of the report is supposed to only show items that are charged as Estimate. This query works perfectly fine until an item gets changed to an actual price on a different transaction than when it was set up.p  pThe problem is that the table codecwoworkorderlineitemcode gets a new item inserted into it with a different transaction sequence transseq column and codecatcustitemacctactivitycode gets a new item as well. This happens instead of actually modifying the original row representing the item ean each table.p  pWhat this means is that the report is still showing the original item the setup item on the report even after the price was changed from Estimate to Actual.p  pHeres a pic of the two tables in my database. Seeing this will help me better explain the problemp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comSdcVG6V.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comSdcVG6V.pngap  pIn the example in the picture, the first table is codecwoworkorderlineitemcode. the transseq 1052833 is the tranasction when the items were set up. The query is only checking if these items are set to a price of ACTUAL and not ESTIMATE, which is represented in pricestatusenum column.  p  pThe 3rd row shows a different transaction, 1052834, where the customer changed the item price to an actual price, hence ACTUAL. p  pIn the second table, codecatcustitemacctactivitycode, you can see the actions completed by the customer. The only thing that seemingly connects the items from the first and second table is codertranslineitmseqcode from the first table, and codecustitemacctdetailitemnbrcode in the second. p  pSo this is what I think I need to do I need to make this query to check the second table to see if there is a MODIFYPRICE in codeitemacctactivitycodecode and then retrieve that rows codecustitemacctdetailitemnbrcode. Then make sure that the row in the first table is not joined where the codecustitemacctdetailitemnbrcode is equal to the codertranslineitmseqcode in the first tablep  pOriginal Query This query works if the pricestatusenum is not changed or changed in the same transaction when it is set up.p  precodeSELECT    DISTINCTca.custacctid                  FROM    cwoworkorderacct ca               INNER JOIN    catcustitemacctactivity acty                       ON                      ca.organizationid  acty.organizationid                            AND ca.custacctid  acty.custacctid                            AND ca.custacctcode  acty.custacctcode               INNER JOIN    cwoworkorderlineitem cli                                ON                          acty.organizationid  cli.organizationid                                AND acty.wkstnid  cli.wkstnid                                AND acty.transseq  cli.transseq                                AND acty.businessdate  cli.businessdate                                AND acty.rtllocid  cli.rtllocid                                AND acty.rtranslineitmseq  cli.rtranslineitmseq                     AND cli.pricestatusenum ESTIMATE codepre

Negative 30073 pI have a table called codeContactscode that contains the columnsp  ol liIdli liFirstNameli liLastNameli ol  pI have another table called codeContactsExtracode. It has the following columnsp  ol liIdli liContactId FK refers to Contacts Idli liPropertyId FK refers to Properties Idli liPropertyValueli ol  pThis is a KeyValue table that stores some extra contact properties. E.g. if contact has a emSalaryem property there is a record in this table for all emContactsem that stores the emSalaryem value.p  pAll Properties whether they are in the main codeContactscode table or not are stored in a separate table called codePropertiescode. In this table, those properties that come from codeContactscode FirstName and LastName are locked. But the user can add or remove custom properties these ones are not locked. The value of these new properties will be stored in codeContactsExtracode.p  pThe codePropertiescode table contains the following columnsp  ol liIdli liNameli ol  pWhat I would like to do is to display all the contact information using one SELECT. So e.g. in the above case there will be a result with columns emIdem,emFirstNameem,emLastNameem and also emSalaryem. The first three come from Contacts and the last comes from the KeyValue table. How can I join these information togetherp

Negative 30073 pI have a series of Android apps, and I need to coordinate their execution. On any given device, there can be any one of those apps installed, or any two of them installed, or any three of them, or any four, and so on. All of those apps can do one specific thing, and they all will try to do that thing from time to time. Now heres the problem at any instant, at most one of those apps should be allowed to do that thing. If any one app is doing that thing, none of the other apps should be doing it they should either wait for their turn, or simply pass. In other words, I need a global mutex or critical section mechanism on Android. In addition, I want to avoid NDK, if possible. What should I dop
Negative 30073 pSo my client want to add a feature to their job site whereby a user uploads a PDF or DOC CVResume file to a particular job that they are applying for. The system will then create a score whereby it evaluates how appropriate the candidate is for the job that theyre applying for. So in the job description, if it says 2 years banking experience, and in the CVResume file it says Barclays Bank  2 Years, then it adds more to this score for them.p  pI have advised the client that I do not think that this is the best way to go about things.

It has to show up, if for example a QLineEdit has the focus.p  pQt manual says, that this has to work out of the box, but the problem is that when a QLineEditObject gets focused the virtual keyboard shows up and hides directly after that. The same happens, when a QLineEdit of the QTCreator gets focused. So I conclude, that the problem is somewhere in the interaction of QT5 and the onboard application.p  pThe virtual keyboard works fine with other applications like firefox. Another keyboard like florence works fine with firefox AND my QT5 application.p  pDoes anyone have any idea Thanks in advancep

Negative 30073 pI am trying to add two buttons to a view that also contains a table view. I want the two buttons to fill the width of the screen for different screen sizes portrait only. There is a minimum width of say 100 units for the buttons to hold the text, but I would like them to be wider for larger screens. I would like the space between buttons to be at least 20 units and at least 20 units of space between the outside edges. This seems like it should be straight forward, but I cant make sense of the align and pin constraints in the Storyboard auto layout. So far, the tutorials I have seen are confusing and dont seem to cover the right amount of detail to help me. Please provide me with some guidance. Below is the layout before constraints are put in place. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com25jZL.png altenter image description herep  pAnd here is what the layout would look on a 4 iPhonep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commrjtQ.png altenter image description herep  pI have already spent a day trying different combinations of constraints, but continue to have problems. Just when I think I have something that works, it wont build because it says I have conflicts. p  pI am trying to use the following tools along with the align tools  not shown to create the proper constraints. I have tried selecting one or both buttons and then using the editor to set the constraints, but each attempt looks bad. Even when I choose Reset to Suggested Constraints, I get wacko results. Please help with suggestions on how to accomplish this seemingly basic task.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtGNOE.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4eS4M.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkDH4I.png altenter image description herep

Negative 30073 pstrongEDITstrong I emthinkem I solved the problem. I will add my own answersolution as soon as I am at work again tomorrow.p  hr  pI am working on a kernel module for the Linux kernel 3.16.x. My module is supposed to receive and send ethernet frames, so I created two threads. One for the receive part, one for the transmit part. It is working fine.p  pMy issue appears when I try to close the device file of the module and unload it. To be precise, it happens when trying to kill my threads. The machine I am testing on a virtual machine, with Ubuntu 14.04 freezes before there is any output whatsoever. However, when I remove the thread killing part from the code, it does not freeze anymore. That is why I am quite certain, the issue stems from the way I handle the killing of the kthreads.p  pHere are my two threadsp  pTX THREAD The semaphore txsem is uped in another part of the code.p  precodestatic int txtaskvoid par      devicegttxtaskrunning  1      allowsignalSIGTERM     while signalpendingcurrent ampamp devicegttxtaskrunning           wait until there is something to send          downinterruptibleampdevicegttxsem          if signalpendingcurrent              PRINTDdeviceTXtask Received kill signaln             break                    check if device is still initialized before continuing         if devicegtinitflag              break                   devicegttxtaskrunning  0     return DEVICERETOK  codepre  pRX THREADp  precodestatic int devicerxtaskvoid par      devicegtrxtaskrunning  1       task loop      allowsignalSIGTERM     while signalpendingcurrent ampamp devicegtrxtaskrunning          rxlen  kernelrecvmsgdevicegtsock, ampmsg,              struct kvec ampiov, 1, DEVICEPAYSIZE, 0          if signalpendingcurrent              PRINTDdevicerxtask Received kill signaln             break                   ifrxlen lt 0              PRINTDdeviceRXtask Got error when receivingn             break                    check if device is still initialized before continuing         if devicegtinitflag              break                   devicegtrxtaskrunning  0     return DEVICERETOK  codepre  pThese guys run until I try to close my device.

Negative 30073 pRecently at work, Ive been tasked with putting together an app that creates all of its views programmatically rather than via a storyboard. For the most part this worked well, aside from more backandforth between running the app and tweaking the views. As a fun side project I wanted to build a debug kit to assist those whore in the same boat.p  pWhat has really helped me with alignmentstyling is a 3rd party library for csslike styling a hrefhttpclassy.as relnofollowhttpclassy.asa, which allows me to see the boundaries of each layerview after adding the following snippet to the stylesheetp  precodeUIView      layer          borderWidth 1       codepre  pId want something similar, but with a label attached to the topleft corner naming the components class name. Effectively, what Id want is an autogenerated and autoattached label on each UIView, preferably one that can be toggled via a variable i.e. codedebugLabelcode. I tried to achieve that via the following codep  precodeprivate var debugLabelsEnabled Bool  false extension UIView      IBInspectable var debugLabel Bool          get              return objcgetAssociatedObjectself, ampdebugLabelsEnabled as Bool                  setvalue              objcsetAssociatedObjectself, ampdebugLabelsEnabled, value, objcAssociationPolicyOBJCASSOCIATIONRETAIN             let label  UILabelframe CGRectorigin self.frame.origin, size CGSizewidth 100, height 15             label.text  stdlibgetDemangledTypeNameself             label.font  UIFontname Courier, size 9             self.addSubviewlabel                codepre  pI then tried to test the above snippet via Classy, by setting codedebugLabelcode on codeUIViewcode as well. That had no effect. However, individually setting codemyView.debugLabel  truecode does work. Unfortunately, I cant expect the developer to manually set this property on each view. I want something along the lines of Classys logic, where I could toggle that label for all of the elements in view and those that may appear later.p  pstrongWhat Im basically trying to do is modify the initialization logic for all UIViews to do something extra without having to subclass because I want all existing elements inheriting from UIView to automatically execute this logic.strong Could someone help me out Is there a sane way to achieve that One way I was thinking of going up to root view controller and then recursively iterating through all of its subviews, but that wont handle views that are not currently shown, like Classy does. I dont mind switching to ObjC for this if needed, I would, however, prefer to keep the rest of my logic in Swift.p

Negative 30073 pSo, Im trying to get Jenkins working inside of docker as an exercise to get experience using docker. I have a small linux server, running Ubuntu 14.04 in my house computer I wasnt using for anything else, and have no issues getting the container to start up, and connect to Jenkins over my local network.p  pMy issue comes in when I try to connect to it from outside of my local network. I have port 8080 forwarded to the serve with the container, and if I run a port checker it says the port is open. However, when I actually try and go to myip8080, I will either get nothing if I started the container just with p 80808080 or Error Invalid request or server failed. HTTPProxy if I run it with p 0.0.0.080808080. p  pI wanted to make sure it wasnt jenkins, so I tried getting just a simple hello world flask application to work, and had the exact same issue. Any recommendations Do I need to add anything extra inside Ubuntu to get it to allow outside connections to go to my containersp  pEDIT Im also just using the official Jenkins image from docker hub.p

Negative 30073 pRecently I have taken over the maintenance of a commercial site. We develop it on a separate dev server and the live server is maintained by the customer. A couple days ago, I made a small change to one .php file to address some deprecated functionality internalencoding as the version was upgraded to PHP 5.6 Everything worked well on the dev site and appeared to work well on the live site. p  pHowever, this morning, I discovered that some parts of the live site are not rendering properly. Since the dev is working as required, I have spent the last several hours trying to find the difference between the two. Now, the update I mention may just be a coincidence, and it is thoroughly possible that I am dealing with a separate issue.p  pIf there is git installed and initialized on both servers, can I copy the code of the dev server to live easily I am relatively new to Git, so a lot of terminology and advanced stuff is confusing to me. What is the best way to go about itp  pP.S. I did the update to the live site using a folder mapped through SSHFS simply edited the file in Aptana and it saved directly to the server. Could this have caused some unexpected file corruptionp

While this should be fine, what is happening is that when they go to the site the saddress bar says a hrefhttpsitename relnofollowhttpsitenamea, we need it to say a hrefhttpsitename.domain.com relnofollowhttpsitename.domain.coma . Now this is an internal website, how can we force the full name. When we pint the sitename it shows the full name sitename.domain.com yet in the browser address bar when we type a hrefhttpsitename relnofollowhttpsitenamea it just goes to sitename not sitename.domain.com . Without redirection how can we fix this in IIS 7p  pThanks in advance p
