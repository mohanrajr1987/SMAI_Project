Positive 10402 pIm trying to create a program that uses a lot of linear algebra and OpenGL, and a colleague of mine recommended that I use the Eigen library to make things a lot simpler. After downloading and extracting the library off of Eigens official website and I clicked on the project, found the Link Binary with Libraries option, went into to the folder that resulted from the unarchiving eigeneigenbdd17ee3b1b3, and then found the Eigen folder. This folder contains all of the header files. p  pThe library showed up on the sidebar, and when I go into the correct subfolder the header files were all there too. According to the Eigen website, you only need the header files for the includes to work, but no matter how I set up the filepath in the include statement, even if what I can physically see what Im including on the sidebar, XCode tells me it cant find the file. Im using an older version of XCode 4. Any advicep

Positive 10402 pI am studying C with a textbook, and it has of course a lot of example source code for me to practice.p  pI had no problem with managing these code files when I was just studying with gcc, a text editor and terminal.p  pAnd now I wanted to use an IDE so I can get hints before compiling each source code, so downloaded one and trying to put every code file into a single project template the IDE offers.p  pThe code files are usually short, and always have main function for each, so creating a project and importing all of them prevented me from compiling I have multiple main function which I should have not.p  pHere is an example so I can describe what the problem I havep  pI now started 7th chapter in the book, so I created a project named ch7. And I have currently two example codes. The project cant be compiled with all the codes at once, so I commented every main function in each of the examples and made a new main.c, containing the main function part from the examples.p  pexample code 1 find.c  has 6 functions, including 1 main function I made it so its now in comment blockp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  int NUMADS  7 char ADS[]   ...      int sportsnobieberchar s  ...  int sportsorworkoutchar s  ...  int nstheaterchar s  ...  int artstheaterordiningchar s  ...  void findint matchchar   ...   int main  ...   codepre  pexample code 2 testdrive.c  has 7 functions and 1 structure, including 1 main function.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int comparescoresconst void scorea, const void scoreb  ...  int comparescoresdescconst void scorea, const void scoreb  ...  typedef struct  ...  rectangle int compareareasconst void recta, const void rectb  ...  int comparenamesconst void namea, const void nameb  ...  int compareareasdescconst void recta, const void rectb  ...  int comparenamesdescconst void namea, const void nameb  ...   int main  ...   codepre  pI commented the main function for each codes because I wanted to use them in a new main.cp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  include find.c include testdrive.c  this list will grow as I make more example codes and include them like this.  And yes, I know this part brings problem. I shouldnt directly include code files like this.  int mainint argc, char argv           statements for main function in example code 1           statements for main function in example code 2      this part is uncommented, because I am testing this one.           statements for other example codes will be here after...          returnEXITSUCCESS  codepre  pThis of course returned compile errors multiple definition of the functions.p  pI know I can make a header and put function declarations for every function existing in all the example codes, and then include that header to my new main.c.p  pBut is this the only way to manage all example codes in a single project in an IDE The files Ive shown here is only two, but a header for them should have 11 function declarations. And I have lot more example codes, from chapter 1 to 6, including about 30 c files and much more total amount of functions in each c file of course, some h, csv and txt files for specific example source codes. p  pIf I have to make a header for all of them, it wouldnt be only consuming lots of time but also will force me to add another few lines to the header every time I write a new code as I keep studying. p  pIt seems much ineffective compared with just writing a code file in a text editor, opening terminal and calling gcc to compile it.p  pSo I think there should be much effective way to manage such example code files in a single place, which shouldnt only be a project. I want to find a way in which I can get advantages of using IDE while code file management doesnt go too complicated.p

Negative 10402 pHow do I distribute a small amount of data in a random order in a much larger volume of datap  pFor example, I have several thousand lines of real data, and I want to insert a dozen or two lines of control data in a random order throughout the real data.p  pNow I am not trying to ask how to use random number generators, I am asking a statistical question, I know how to generate random numbers, but my question is how do I ensure that this the data is inserted in a random order while at the same time being fairly evenly scattered through the file.p  pIf I just rely on generating random numbers there is a possibility albeit a very small one that all my control data, or at least clumps of it, will be inserted within a fairly narrow selection of real data. What is the best way to stop this from happeningp  pTo phrase it another way, I want to insert control data throughout my real data without there being a way for a third party to calculate which rows are control and which are real. hr  Update I have made this a community wiki so if anyone wants to edit my question so it makes more sense then go right ahead. hr  Update Let me try an example I do not want to make this language or platform dependent as it is not a coding question, it is a statistical question.p  ulliI have 3000 rows of real data this amount will change from run to run, depending on the amount of data the user has.li liI have 20 rows of control data again, this will change depending on the number of control rows the user wants to use, anything from zero upwards.liul  pI now want to insert these 20 control rows emroughlyem after every 150 rows or real data has been inserted 300020  150. However I do not want it to be as accurate as that as I do not want the control rows to be identifiable simply based on their location in the output data.p  pTherefore I do not mind emsomeem of the control rows being clumped together or for there to be emsomeem sections with very few or no control rows at all, but generally I want the control rows fairly evenly distributed throughout the data.p

Negative 10402 pIm not sure how to ask this, but here goes the questionp  pIm migrating from J2SE to Qt. After creating some small applications in Qt, I noticed that Ive created way too many files compared to what I wouldve create if I was developing in Java I use Netbeans. p  pFor an example, for a GUI to Orders, Id have to createp  ol liMain Order Search Windowli liEdit Order Dialogli liManage Order Dialogli liMaybe some other dialogs...li ol  pFor Java, I dont have to create a new file for every new Dialog, the Dialog will be created in the JFrame class itself. So, I will only be seeing 1 file for Orders which has other Dialogs in it. However, in Qt, Id have to create 1 ui file, 1 header file, 1 cpp file for each of the Dialog I know I can just put the cpp in the header, but its easier to view codes in seperate files. So, in the end, I might end up with 3 if there are 3 dialogs x3 files  9 files for the GUI in Qt, compared to Java which is only 1 file.p  pI do know that I can create a GUI by coding it manually. But it seems easy on small GUIs but not some on complicated GUIs with lots of inputs, tabs and etc. p  pSo, is there any suggestion on how to minimize the file created in Qt p

Negative 10402 pIm working on a javascript extension for IE and Id like to capture the HTML of a page and add an anchor and highlighting around the current selection. Ive gotten this mostly working several different ways, but each approach has problems. Id like to leave the original page unmodified, which is harder than it seems. For example, Ive tried getting a TextRange and calling pasteHTML as followsp  precodevar rng  document.selection.createRange var h  rng.htmlText rng.pasteHTMLltspan STYLEbackgroundcoloryellowgt  h  ltspangt codepre  pand other variations based on this approach. The problem with that is that the htmlText method doesnt return partial HTML, so if the selection includes a closing codeltpcode but not the start, it disappears and wrecks the formatting of the source page.p  pIve also looked at calling execCommand with the BackColor and CreateBookmark methods to change the formatting, but again I end up changing the original page, which I dont want to do.p  pIs there some way to get a copy of the page with the selection set and wrap the selection in a span without modifying the original page and without losing any HTML tagsp  pstrongEDITstrong My end goal is to copy the modified HTML to the clipboard, so the source page is unmodified but the copied HTML text has the anchor and highlighting.p

Negative 10402 pOne of our TFS 2010 requirements is to support software projects that still use Visual Studio Team System 2008 for development. My question is whether a Build Server based on Team Build 2010 can compile 2008 code by itself. I mean connecting to TFS 2010 using Visual Studio Team Suite 2008, which means we are planning to install the Forward Compatibility Update on all development machines.p  pWe have an existing TFS 2008 system and according to that the build server requires VSTS 2008 to be installed in order to compile code and run automated tests. I would assume the same for TFS 2010 where VS 2010 Ultimate should be installed in the build server, but we are not sure whether VSTS 2008 is required as well in this use case.p  pI hope someone could share their thoughts about this.

Negative 10402 pI have a Joomla component which calls a helper function to create a captcha image. Everything works fine when sh404 is disabled, but when sh404 is enabled the session variable for the security image isnt being set correctly so when you submit the form you get Invalid Captcha message. The funny thing is if you submit another 56 times, it validates fine and submits. Ive tried just about everything I can think of  when I echo the session variable and submitted captcha code it appears that the session is a step behind  for examplep  pIf I submit the form the first time and echo the session variable and submitted code, it looks like the session variable is not being set in time  I get a blank value for the session variable.

Negative 10402 pI have a solution that uses NServicebus which contains at least 3 projects that are of interest for this scenario a publisher, a sweep, and a webservice. Basically the sweeps gather data for the publisher to store in a database and then publish to subscribers. The webservice gives access to the data stored in the publishers database.p  pWhen I built this solution on my dev box and deployed to the test environment everything was fine. Last week we started using automated builds on a build server and while it builds successfully, the services would not start up in the test environment. I found this to be because NServicesBus uses marker interfaces. The NServicesBus generic host uses reflection to check assemblies in the same directory as the host for those markers so it knows which to fire up. Unlike my local build the build server does not build each project into its own bin directory, it just dumps all the assemblies into a single bin directory. Since there are now multiple classes that want to be started by the host, it doesnt work out. Also, the webservice has a lot more assemblies to include than the publisher and sweep need so the end result is the same assemblies get deployed to three different directories. Its unnecessary and doesnt work.p  pIve been modifying the build like so to get around this, but its tedious and its not change tolerantp  precodeltCreateItem IncludeOutDir.

Negative 10402 pI seem to have a huge memory leak in a large Java application.

For example, the so, tmp and jar entries stay relatively stable and dont increase all that much in mapped items nor do their mapped size increase unexpectedly either as expected.p  pBut what does grow over time significantly is the number of mapped entries that are NOT assigned to a particular pathname.

Negative 10402 pi have an android application that can operate with or without a location. handling this case in an activity is straightforward i set a location listener and wait with a progress dialog, but allow the wait to be aborted by the user it so happens that if the location provider is disabled, theres no special error is just never returns the location ... nice.p  phowever, i also have a service that requires the location. the service may run before the activity,so i cant depend on the activity to get the location or not. p  pthe question is how to handle this case in the service. i can wait for the location, but since i cant rely on a user abort, how do i know when to stop waiting, and assume that no location is available it seems i could do something like,p  ol lischedule service with action get location, which sets the location listener, waits for updates, schedules the same service say 3 minutes later with action refreshli liin service action refresh, get the last known location, and be happy with that. it was either obtained or not. if its null, we know we have no location and weve done the best we can.li ol  pit seems like this will work, but its getting complicated as i can no longer use the simple intent service i assume, because if the intent service stops itself after onHandleIntent, then the on location changed event wont be received.p  panyway, its getting sort of complicated, so im wondering if theres a simpler way.p
Negative 10402 pI have a script that imports CSV files. What ends up in my database is, among other things, a list of customers and a list of addresses. I have a table called codecustomercode and another called codeaddresscode, where codeaddresscode has a codecustomeridcode.p  pOne thing thats important to me is not to have any duplicate rows. Therefore, each time I import an address, I do something like thisp  precodeaddress  new Address addressgtsetLine1line1 addressgtsetZipzip addressgtsetCountryusa addressgtsetCitycity addressgtsetStatestate address  DoctrinegetTableAddressgtfindOrCreateaddress addressgtsave codepre  pWhat codefindOrCreatecode does, as you can probably guess, is find a matching address record if it exists, otherwise just return a new codeAddresscode object.

To save each row in the CSV file which translates into several codeINSERTcode statements on different tables, it takes about a quarter second. Id like to get it as close to instantaneous as possible because I sometimes have over 50,000 rows in my CSV file.

Negative 10402 pIn the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms743230.aspxlisting relnofollowlist of sources for dependency property valuesa, along with the relative precedence, a local value is highest precedence for determining the base value.br Immediately after the local value are template properties from the templated parente.g. the parent ControlTemplate for a control that was created in the context of a template.p  pMy question is thissince a local value is listed as taking precedence over a template property, does this mean that a property value set explicitly local value on a control created in the template takes precedence over one set with a property trigger in that template  That seems to be what the rules imply, but properties set with triggers in a control template seem to override i.e. higher precedence local values set in the template.p  pOr does the local value in the precedence list refer to values set only on controls NOT created in templatesand therefore you cant really compare precedence between a local value and a property set via a trigger in the templated parentp

Negative 10402 pHow do I remove the horizontal padding to the left and right of custom left and right UINavigationBar items There seems to be  10 points of padding that iOS sets by default.p  pIm customizing left and right navigation bar buttons I have given up on trying to set my own backButtonItem, so Im just using the leftBarButtonItem.p  pIn either case left or right, pressing these custom buttons indicates that Apple seems to preserve some padding to the left of the leftBarButtonItem, and to the right of the rightBarButtonItem regardless of how wide I make the custom background and image properties of the UIButton I place inside the leftright bar button item as its custom view.p  pSince UIBarButtonItems have no frame I can access, I cant position them within their superview like I can normal UIViews.p  pAny suggestions on how to remove this default padding See screen shot attached to see the bit Im trying to reduce to a zero width.

Negative 10402 pIm doing some spare time coding around a hrefhttpculturegrid.org.ukCultureGrida. They have a SOLR API to access 1.2m cultural artefacts. Ive released a gem to consume their service, but Ive got a nice idea about using Datamapper with a SOLR adapter backend to do it in a better way.p  pI just found a project from last year on Github handily called a hrefhttpsgithub.comwinescoutdmsolradapterdmsolradaptera. Its a fork of someone elses work from 2008 and to use it you have to clone the project and run a rake task to install it not much use on heroku, so Id have to vendor it. Unfortunately that task is now broken because they didnt pin their gem versions, and Bones has changed considerably between version 2 and 3.p  pBasically  it needs a bit of a recode to get it to be a gem, and if Im going to do that I might as well release it myself and do it the way I know  using Jeweler instead.p  pSo, of course Ill drop all of the authors a line, but I just wondered what the ethics and etiquette are here. Do I include my username in the gem or do I use the original gem name Could that potentially trash someone elses installation, even though the gem is not listed on Rubygems.org Do I follow their numbering convention They seem to have chosen 1.0.0 and stuck with it, with no further activity. Or do I just start again from version 0.1.0p  pFailing that, do I just grab the bits I want, include it in my new project and give a hat tip That doesnt sound very useful for others who might want to do the same things.p  pOr perhaps I take the bits I find useful, make an entirely new gem called something like dmsolrbackend and go from scratchp  pOh, the dilemmas  what would you dop

Negative 10402 pIm doing a c project that requires a server to create a new thread to handle connections each time accept returns a new socket descriptor. I am using select to decide when a connection attempt has taken place as well as when a client has sent data over the newly created client socket the one that accept creates. So two functions and two selects  one for polling the socket dedicated to listening for connections, one for polling the socket created when a new connection is successful.p  pThe behavior of the first case is what I expect  FDISSET returns true for the id of my listening socket only when a connection is requested, and is false until the next connection attempt. The second case does not work, even though the code is exactly the same with different fdset and socket objects.

I tested it and even with tv being reset and the fdset being zeroed every time the server loops, select still returns 1 immediately.

Also, client does not send anything, just connects.p

So now I am in codeCentralFeed.jsfcode, but then any request that I send from here will bring back to codehome.jsfcode to login again. I walk through a debugger, so when I first login, the first time I get into the Filter, i successfully retrieve the codeusercode object from session by coderequest.getSession.getAttributeusercode. But after that, when I get back in the filter, I no longer the session attribute codeusercode anymore.

Back then, you show me how to force a logout when user log in somewhere else httpstackoverflow.comquestions2372311jsfhowtoinvalidateanusersessionwhenhelogstwicewiththesamecredentia.

I walk through the debugger, and here is what happen. When I first log in, the LoginServlet catch it. Then the line coderequest.getSession.setAttributeuser, usercode invoke the method codevalueBoundcode. Then the Filter got called, and the line codechain.doFilterreq, rescode invoke the codevalueBoundcode method again, this time, codesessioncode is not null so it get in the if and codesession.invalidatecode. I comment the session.invalidate out and it work. But as u might have guess, I cant force a log out when user login somewhere else. Do you see a obvious solution for this BalusC p

Negative 10402 pI have a C UserControl that hosts a TextBox.p  pWhen the custom control is disabled, I would like the TextBox to be rendered as if it were Disabled  ReadOnly i.e. not greyed out. Therefore, when the custom control catches the EnabledChanged it sets the hosted TextBox properties accordingly.p  pHowever, the Enabled state of the UserControl takes precedence over everything else and the TextBox is still rendered greyed out even though its internal ForeColor is correct.p  pTherefore, I decided to hide the hosted TextBox when the custom control is disabled and draw it myself. I can successfully render the TextBox border using the various ControlPaint.DrawXxx functions.p  pHowever, drawing the text results in a stretched output, when compared to the native rendering. That is, the text starts at the exact same pixel location, but character spacing is noticeably larger.p  pI use the TextBoxs own Font to perform the rendering so I dont know what Im doing wrong. The only justification that I can make is that the C TextBox is rendered directly by Windows using the ExtTextOut Win32 API and this results in the evident differences.p  pWhat options can I use to mimic the native TextBox rendering p

Negative 10402 pI have a requirement where in I need to have two threads of the same process rendering to screen using openGL ES.. I am newbie in android applications and havent done much application development before. I know a bit about openGL ES and I need to test some driver code urgently.  p  pI have two Activity of GLSurfaceView. I use setcontentview and the layout xml file for defining the layout. Each activity has its layout file separately. The size of the rendered displays are small around 10 of the screen and I have made sure that the positions of the display are nonoverlapping in the 2 layouts. Initially one activity is launched which in turn launches the 2nd activity through intent mechanism in the oncreate.p  p1 I tried have two activities to run at same time but i have not been successful at that. Some documentation referred that while one activity is running the other activity is possible to be in the visible state. I am not sure whether its possible to have both the activities to be visible at the same time.p  p2 Initially the implementation was that one activity launches the 2nd activity through intent mechanism in the oncreate. This resulted in 2 activities running but not simultaneously. Is there a way I can have both activities running simultaneously and displaying.p  p3 Later for creating the second thread I used the runnable mechanism and created a thread and invoked the 2nd activity through the run of runnable. While I could confirm that the thread was confirmed I could not see the 2nd activity running.p  p4 The constraint is due to the fact that I need to have separate eglCreateWindowSurface for each of the 2 rendering threads.p  pAre there any sampleexamples where I can see how 2 activities or 2 threads are running simultaneusly while displaying to the screenp  pI have gone through many tutorials and sample code and discussions to find some hint to my problem. Can someone help with some links or explanationsp

Negative 10402 pI have a WPF 3D application C .NET 4.0 that has a lot of 3D geometries. Now I need to color these geometries by applying a texture. The source for the texture is one large .PNG file like the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOfLV4.png altExample of resultsfilep  pThe .PNG file contains repeating sections. One section for each combination of Case, Deviation and Harmonic. Cases have one or more deviations nDev. Cases also have one or more harmonics nHarm.

Negative 10402 pIm new to Java and Ive been trying to implement an algorithm for finding the roots of a cubical equation. The problem arises when I calculate the discriminant and try to check where it falls relative to zero.p  pIf you run it and enter the numbers 1 5 8 4, the output is as followsp  precode1 5 8 4 p0.333333, q0.074074 disc10.001372, disc20.001372 discriminant0.00000000000000001236 Discriminant is greater than zero. codepre  pI know the problem arises because the calculations with doubles are not precise.

Negative 10402 pI am reading data 100 bytes at 100hz from a serial port.  My buffer is 1024 bytes, so often my buffer doesnt get completely used.  Sometimes however, I get hiccups from the serial port and the buffer gets filled up.p  pMy data is organized as a [header]data[checksum].  When my buffer gets filled up, sometimes a messagedata is split across two reads from the serial port.p  pThis is a simple problem, and Im sure there are a lot of different approaches.  I am ahead of schedule so I would like to research different approaches.  Could you guys name some paradigms that cover buffering in high speed data that might need to be put together from two reads  Note, the main difference I see in this problem from say other buffering Ive done image acquisition, tcpip, is that there we are guaranteed full packetsmessages.  Here a packet may be split between reads, which we will only know once we start parsing the data.p  pOh yes, note that the data buffered in from the read has to be parsed, so to make things simple, the data should be contiguous when it reaches the parsing.  Plus I dont think thats the parsers responsibilityp  pSome Ideas I Hadp  ol liCarry over unused bytes to my original buffer, then fill it with the read after the left over bytes from the previous read. For example, we read 1024 bytes, 24 bytes are left at the end, theyre a partial message, memcpy to the beginning of the readbuffer, pass the beginning  24 to read and read in 1024  24li liCreate my own class that just gets blocks of data.  It has two pointers, readwrite and a large chunk of memory 1024  4.  When you pass in the data, the class updates the write pointer correctly, wraps around to the beginning of its buffer when it reaches the end.  I guess like a ring bufferli liI was thinking maybe using a codestdvectorltunsigned chargtcode.  Dynamic memory allocation, guaranteed to be contiguous.li ol  pThanks for the info guysp

When a user clicks on office worker, isotope should sort to only show office workers, and the appropriate officerelated secondary filters any, secretary, midlevel, executive appear.  The user can then further filter using those secondary job types.  I can get this to work.  p  pBut the problem arises when the user then clicks on a different toplevel job category.  So, lets say a user has clicked on office worker and secretary.  Now, the user wants to see all laborers.  When the user clicks laborer the secondary office job type filter secretary is still active, and so the user sees no results.  What I want to happen is for the office job type filter to lose its filtering either by becoming inactive or defaulting to any so that all people in the laborer job category are shown.  Then the user can filter by the secondlevel laborer job types.  p  pHere is the isotope jquery Im currently using. p  precodeltscriptgt     function         var filtercontainer  peoplecontainer,         filters            filtercontainer.isotope             itemSelector  .person,             masonry                  columnWidth 80                                 filter buttons         .filter a.clickfunction         var this  this          dont proceed if already selected         if  this.hasClassselected               return                   var optionSet  this.parents.optionset          change selected class         optionSet.find.selected.removeClassselected         this.addClassselected          if.officeworker.hasClassselected             officetype.show             laborertype.hide             healthcaretype.hide                   else if.laborer.hasClassselected             officetype.hide             laborertype.show             healthcaretype.hide                  else if.healthcareworker.hasClassselected             officetype.hide             laborertype.hide             healthcaretype.show                     store filter value in object          var group  optionSet.attrdatafiltergroup         filters[ group ]  this.attrdatafiltervalue          convert object into array         var isoFilters  []         for  var prop in filters               isoFilters.push filters[ prop ]                   var selector  isoFilters.join         filtercontainer.isotope filter selector           return false                 ltscriptgt codepre  pThis accomplishes the combination filtering and makes the secondlevel job types show up only when the corresponding toplevel job category is selected.  But, when a new toplevel job category is selected after a secondarylevel filter is selected, it doesnt revert to any filtering for the secondarylevel and maintains the filtering for the wrong toplevel job category, making it so no results are shown in the isotope filtering.  Ive also tried putting all secondarylevel job types in a single sorting set.  That makes it so theres just one any and if a user clicks that, all results will be shown that fit the selected toplevel job category. But it doesnt automatically revert to any so its not much better than when the secondarylevel filters are split into three groups.  p  pHow can I make this work the way I wantp

Negative 10402 pI have a site where a csv of racehorse data is to be uploaded once a week.  The CSV contains the details of about 19,000 racehorses currently registered in the UK and is about 1.3MB in size, on average.  I have a script that processes that csv and either updates the horse if it exists and the ratings data has changed, or adds it if it doesnt exist.  If a horse is unchanged, it skips to the next one.  The script works, as it was running on the host I use as a test.  It took 5 or 6 minutes to run less than ideal, I know, but it worked.p  pHowever, were now testing on the staging version of the clients host, and its running for 15 minutes and then returning a 504 timeout.  Weve tweaked htaccess and php.ini settings as much as were able ... no joy.p  pThe host is in a shared environment, so they tell me that MySQLs LOAD DATA is unavailable to us.p  pWhat other alternative approaches would you try  Or is there a way of splitting the csv into chunks and running a process on each one in turn, for examplep  pThanksp  pAustenp

Negative 10402 pOK this question appears many times across many context on the web. However, I am yet to find a sufficient answer. It seems like there is no way of displaying globals in the DebugVariables view. A workaround this is to use the Expressions view. This is fine for watching the variables, but it wont let you change their contents, as in the Variables view.p  pNow, one could do so via the Memory view. This is OK when dealing with simple variables, but gets complicated when dealing with compound objects e.g., structures.p  pSo, how can you easily watch and change the values of globals and static variables in Eclipse CDTp

Negative 10402 pLets say I have a FB app Ive created, and for whatever reason the server code for the app is responsible for posting stories to the app users wall using a token.p  pNow lets say we want to take down that post at a later date  easy, right Because the app created the post, it owns it, and using the ID it received originally it can take that post down. I presume the ID I get back is actually an object id referring to my content, rather than specifically to the post on the users wall  correctp  pHeres the thing though. What if one or more friends of the user shared that story to their own wall  what if this happened a number of times, spreading through the friend relationship tree further and further. Does my app still have the power to remove all of these posts, because it created the original postp  pAdditionally, what if the original user deleted the post themselves from their wall, but not until it had been shared by hisher friends Would this have the same effect delete everywhere, or would it only be that one specific post being removed Would my app get an error when it tried to delete the post itself if the post had already been deleted by the user p  pThe reason I ask is because, if my app deleted the original post that it made to the users wall, I would want emallem of the shared posts or likes to also be deleted, no matter where they were down the friend chain. I dont want to delete my original post and assume all is well, only to discover that because it was shared several times down the chain that it is still visible somewhere. p  pIn case its relevant, the post my app will make would require a custom image and a specific return URL  I tried the codeuseridlinkscode graph API and it didnt work theres a bug with it. So Id be most likely using codeuseridfeedcode to make the post.p

Negative 10402 pOk, I basically have randomly placed graphics items on a graphics scene. I open a window and display these items. When I resize the window, I want this items to stay the same size but reposition proportionally to the window size. How I did this was I subclassed the graphics view and then when there was a resize event, it sent the resize object to my graphicsscene object. I was then able to do something like thisp  precodedouble scaleX  doubleeventgtsize.widthdoubleeventgtoldSize.width double scaleY  doubleeventgtsize.heightdoubleeventgtoldSize.height codepre  pThen I used these values to do thisp  precodederivedPointItemgtsetPos derivedPointItemgtpos.x  scaleX,                           derivedPointItemgtpos.y  scaleY  codepre  pThis works ok, but its not quite right if I resize the window really small or large. I think the problem is that the graphicsscene rect and the graphics view rect are not the same or something. Furthermore, I have a background which resizes to window sizep  precodevoid roiwindowdrawBackground QPainter painter, const QRectFamp rect       thisgtsetSceneRect0,0,rect.width,rect.height     paintergtsave     paintergtdrawImagerect, refimage     paintergtrestore  codepre  pThis is something I need in the program Im writing. Also, it allows me to see if the resizing works. I basically can set the background to be a polygon, then place points on the edges of the polygon. When I resize the image to be very large or small the points are no longer on the vertices of the polygon althought they are somewhat close. Anyone know a better way to do this or a way to fix it Thanks.p  pEDIT Heres the project Im working onp  pdropbox.comsmyxi8kvdl7x9ye2ncorr.tar.gzp

Negative 10402 pI currently work on a tracking project using a GPS receiver and a modem which sends the GPS positions to a server. Since this year there is a new modem available with an upgraded firmware library. The hardware design team at my company developed a new hardware using the new modem.p  pMy problem is now How can I build my application for both modem types from the same sourcesp  pWhat I mean by that is In the new firmware library there are some classes and methods available which I cant use with the old modem and the old firmware library. I use NetBeans as my IDE and therefore I can create easily different ant configurations to build the application for both modem types, but how do I implement that in my code. I cant have parts of the new firmware library in my code since it wouldnt even compile, I have to somehow dynamically link the correct firmware library. How is this done in Java Furthermore, the company which produces the modems has changed their company name, and all packages which I import are now codecom.newname.blacode instead of codecom.oldname.blacodep  pAnd thats mostly in all of my source files. Im sure there is a way to solve this problem in Java. Has maybe somebody a good example for such an issuep

Negative 10402 pIm wondering if there is a better way to parse a Varchar to an Int in TSQL  SQL Server.  I say parse because I need something more robust than the CASTCONVERT system funcs its particularly useful to return NULL when the parse fails, or even a default value.p  pSo heres the function Im using now, originally obtained from someones SQL blog cant even remember specifically who...p  pre ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[udfToNumber]      Str varcharmax  RETURNS int AS BEGIN     DECLARE Result int      SET Str  LTRIMRTRIMStr      IF Str OR Str IS NULL         OR ISNUMERICStr0         OR Str LIKE [ 09]         OR Str IN ., , ,                    SET Result  NULL     ELSE     IF CASTStr AS NUMERIC38,0 NOT BETWEEN 2147483648. AND 2147483647.         SET Result  NULL     ELSE         SET Result  CASTStr AS int      RETURN Result END pre  pAnd you could add a line before the end, like if Result is null, set Result  , or something like that.p  pIts not very efficient, because using it in a JOIN or WHEREINSELECT  where say the LEFT column is INT and the RIGHT is VARCHAR, and I try to parse the RIGHT  on any significantly large dataset, takes a lot longer than if I CAST the LEFT INT column to a VARCHAR first and then do the JOIN.p  pAnyway, I know ideally that I shouldnt need to do this kind of thing in the first place if my tablesdatatypes are created amp populated appropriately, but we all know the ideal world is very far from reality sometimes, so humor me.  Thanksp  pEDIT SQL Server versions 2005 amp 2008 boxes running 2005 will be upgraded soon so 2008specific answers are fine.p

Negative 10402 pThis is a problems Ive been investigating in the last week and cant find any solution. Found posts asking the same but never getting an answer, hopefully this will help others as well.p  pI have a codeWCFcode service that returns an object containing a codestreamcode inside it. I use codebasicHttpBindingcode with streamed transfer and Mtom to send it to the client.p  pClient calls the codeWCFcode service and closes the proxy immediately after it receives the response object.p  pNext, the client reads the stream it got from the WCF service and writes it to a file on the local disk. All of this works fine.p  pMy problem is when the client wants to abort the operation and stop downloading the data from the WCF service. If I call code.closecode on the stream, e.g codeserverReply.DataStream.Closecode then it blocks and reads the whole stream from the WCF service till its end before continuing. The stream can be quite large and the network is not always fast.p  pThis is very undesirable for both network resource usage, which is basically wasted on data that has no use anymore. And since codebasicHttpBindingcode allows only two concurrent TCP connections by default to the WCF service server, it blocks other connection attempts until the stream is read till its end.p  pI could increase the number of concurrent connections, but that would be a bad solution as it would create an opening for trouble. p  pFor example, 20 aborted downloads that are still downloading the data to throw it away. I need to make the transfer stop completely.p  pOn the client, the stream object is just a regular codeStreamcode class, so it only has the close method, nothing else.p  pCalling code.closecode or code.abortcode on the proxy object doesnt help, neither does destroying it using code.disposecode or any other method. On the server side, I handle the codeOperationContext.OperationCompletedcode event, but it is not fired until the data from the codestreamcode is read till the end.p  pSo the question is, how do I closeabort the stream without reading it entirelyp

Negative 10402 pSo lets say I have a WPF form with several text boxes, if you tab to the text box and it already has something in it, I want to select all the text in that box so typing will erase that text.  If you mouse click on the box, it probably means you want to change a letter somewhere, so do not highlight all in this case.  Seems easy enough, but a good solution as so far eluded me.  Heres what I have so far that is very emcloseem to working, but not quite perfect.p  precodeltStyle xKeyTextBoxStyle TargetTypeTextBoxgt     ltEventSetter EventGotKeyboardFocus HandlerEventSetterOnHandler gt ltStylegt codepre  pp  precodeprivate void EventSetterOnHandlerobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      TextBox txt  sender as TextBox     if txt  null txt.SelectAll  codepre  pSo when the box gets keyboard focus it selects all, so tabbing to the text box selects all the text perfectly.  However if the mouse clicks this method gets called as well, which also highlights the text, but the click then puts the cursor where the mouse clicked after.  So functionally its perfect, but it still bothers me that it flickers selecting everything when the mouse clicks.  Any better way to do this, or put some kind of check in my event to know that I gained keyboard focus from a mouse click and not a tabp

Negative 10402 psee update belowp  pWhile running within the VisualStudio 2010 environment, I can easily tell if my Winform application causes an exception.  I just have to go to Debug  Exceptions and make sure that both columns of checkboxes are checked.  I then run the application and if any exceptions then I get dropped straight into the offending piece of code.p  pHow do I determine exceptions during testing, when I give test build to a tester.  I do not want the tester to run within Visual Studio, just as a regular user.  I still want to know if there are exceptions and the pertinent details.p  pObviosualy, I should be able to control the process, so that when the code gets released normal execution happens.p  pYes, I know about and use trycatch blocks, but I am talking about a method similar to Visual Studio exception catcher and reporter, just possibly compiled into the product and used for deployment to beta testers.p  pMaybe Visual Studio has such a feature, in which case where and how to set up, or possibly a third party component.p  p[Update I added two subquestions, which you can find at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12731065unhandledexceptionnextlineorexitUnhandled Exception next line or exita.p  pThe solution mentioned below sounds great and with a tweak probably works, just not at the moment.p  pInside the Visual Studio both 2010 and now 2012 works great. The exception handler gets called, okay after VS breaks at the line and I say to continue. I decided to test outside the VS2012 IDE, good thing for that. The OS traps the bug, shows the standard an An Unhandled Exception Occurred dialog giving the details along with a continue and quit buttons. Selecting continue, just continues the application with no trapping into my uber exception handler. Selecting quite, whitesout the application and displays the standard close window dialog. The quit button also does not call my uber handler.p  pThe purpose is so that my exception handler gets called. I do not need an uber exception handler if I am working inside the VS2012 IDE. The purpose of the handler is for end users and beta testers, namely anyone other than myself and who will not have my development station.p  pSo unless I am missing something, the question is still open.p  pThere are code samples in the other question, enough to copy and paste and create a test application in a couple minutes time. ]p  pThanks in advance,p  pSarahp

Negative 10402 pLets first forget about Hibernate.  Assume that I have two tables, A amp B.  Two transactions are updating same records in these two tables, but txn 1 update B and then A, while txn 2 update A then B.  This is a typical deadlock example.

Negative 10402 pIm creating an app that has facebook integration to post images to a users wall.p  pIm using the prime31 unity plugin called Social Networking.p  pHeres my issue on a fresh run having no previous authorizations on Facebook and having uninstalled the app on the device to make sure there is no cached data, Ill login to facebook with email as the only permission. The device then switches from my app to the facebook app to ask the user for permission. I hit the log in button, then MOST of the time Ill just end up switching to my news feed in facebook without ever switching back to my app. Sometimes after switching to the facebook app instead of the permission screen Ill end up on a blank page with cancel as the only button up top, and pressing cancel does nothing Im stuck on that blank page. And sometimes Ill authorize and correctly switch back to my app.p  pEDIT Well this feels pointless, but I discovered the source of the problem so I thought I would share in case anyone else runs into this.p  pMy problem was that when I was building from Unity, I was usually hitting cmdB or buildappend. This overwrites the info.plist file, removing the URL injection that the prime31 plugin does for the app switch.p  pGoing into the build settings menu, hitting build and run, and pressing replace will run the code that inserts the URL into info.plist.p

Negative 10402 pI need some clarification on this subject as I just ran into an issue with loading swfs into a reused loader object.brp  pSo lets say I have 3 SWFs.br Main.swfbr childA.swfbr childB.swfbrp  pMain.swf has a loader object in it that gets reused myloader.loadchildA.swf and childA or childB swf will be loaded via user interaction.br Both child swfs have a com package with a class in that package called config.br The config files are different files for both classes just named the same.br both child swf also dispatch an event that the Main listens forp  pNow the problem I had was if childA was loaded first then after childB was loaded it would still show as childA. Basically, whichever one got loaded into that loader first would be the winner.br This drove me nuts as nothing I did would cause the swf to unload. Not until I found the following code.brp  precodevar appDomainApplicationDomain  new ApplicationDomain var contextLoaderContext  new LoaderContextfalse, appDomain contentPanel.loadnew URLRequeststr, context codepre  pI stumbled over this code on a post somewhere talking about how to truly unload a swf. Apparently, This also applies to how to truly load a swf.br As you can see a new appDomain is created and assigned to the context when loaded.br This works like a dream I can now load and unload all day long.brp  pMy confusion is the event that the child dispatches still works, when I dont think the Main swf should pick it up due to it not being in the same appDomain.br I mean shouldnt the event be blockedp

In these projects I use a generic Repository and a generic Unit of Work to persist the entities i.e. 2 small generic classes no mapping. By electing a core entity as the aggregrate root, other entities are added and updated on the client side and the core entity graph containing these changes is sent to the WCF service and used in the Logic Layer which creates the Repositorylt[core entity] and uses the UnitOfWorklt[core entity].SaveRepositorylt[core entity] to persist the STEs and their children to the database.p  pNow Microsoft is recommending that we not use STEs. a hrefhttpvisualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.coma3ac10a593654096bb58d9a1ba71db8fSee this articleap  pSo my question is, What isare the patterns that are now recommended by Microsoft for applications that are persisting client changes to WCF Services that use EFp  pI created a EF5 Model and examined the generated code. The there are no attributes for a WCF Service i.e. DataContract, DataMember etcp  pEF4 had a ADO.NET DbContext Generator with WCF Support template, but there isnt a EF5 equivalent.p  pOne site suggested I should use a partial class file and decorate the same properties in that file with these attributes. But unless .net 4.5 has introduced partial properties, I cannot see how that can be done.p  pAnother  a hrefhttpwww.dotnetconsult.co.ukweblog2PermaLink,guid,b9c1ff6588234a5eae077531c258a5ac.aspxbloga  suggested using DTO and Automapper, which means more mapping which is error prone especially when entity fields change type.p  pSo now that DBContext generated code classes are not Service enabled, does this mean that we need to write another set of classes POCOs that    p  ul lineeds to be mapped FROM the DBContext generated code classes after querying the database.li liholds the data state for the WCF Service clients    li liis updatable by that clients   li liis mapped by the clients    li lihas the ability to hold changed state so this can be sent back to the WCF Service   li lineeds to be mapped TO the DBContext generated code classes for persistenceli ul  pstrongIt seems we just took a great leap backwards to EF3.strongp  pIf you code both client and service that runs on your hardware, you dont need to be concerned about data structures at the client as they belong to you.p  pIf you also need to expose some of your service methods to non.NET clients you should do the 5 points above for those services anyway and use DTOs and Automapper in those occasions.These should be in a different WCF Service but implemented against the same Logic Layer, after mapping.p  pBut how many of these type of non.NET client services are be created in the day to day building of web applications in most software teamsp  pThis latest recommendation is confusing as it has not been explained as to WHY STEs are ALWAYS illconceived and what now, are the recommended patterns to be used for persisting client changes to WCF Services that use EF.p  pCan anybody inform me where I can find a good resource that solves this architectural design issuep  pP.S.p  pPlease dont recommend WCF Data Services or WCF RIA as we need a lot of control over how your data is retrieved and saved by clients.p  pPlease dont recommend Code First as we use Database First as we want to have and need to control the structure of that database and not have to generated for us.p

Negative 10402 pIm about to merge certain revisions from trunk into a releasebranch. Ive checked with mergeinfo how many revisions are eligible to get merged, and that were 42. Although its definitely possible and not too hard to check each revision log and decide whether it should be merged or not. I would then check the logs with TortoiseSVN and use the command line codesvn merge c rev1,rev2code function or codercode for ranges of course.p  pI was wondering if TortoiseSVN has a tool to make this cherrypicking a lot easier. Ive googled for it, but found out that only probably TortoiseGit has it.p  pAny other methods which makes this process easier and faster are also welcomep

Negative 10402 pWPF bindings uses CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture rather than CultureInfo.CurrentCulture which means they do not respect the preferences specified in Control Panels emRegion and Languageem dialog.p  pTo properly implement localisation in a WPF application it is therefore necessary to somehow assign CurrentCulture to the ConverterCulture of every binding.p  pThis is best done with a StaticResource declared in App.xaml but there is a problem the CultureInfo class has no public constructors. As a result, markup like thisp  precodeltApplication xClassScriptedRoutePlayback.App              xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation              xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml              xmlnssysclrnamespaceSystemassemblymscorlib              xmlnsglobclrnamespaceSystem.Globalizationassemblymscorlib              StartupUriMainWindow.xamlgt   ltApplication.Resourcesgt     ltglobCultureInfo xKeyCurrentCulture gt   ltApplication.Resourcesgt ltApplicationgt codepre  pgenerates a warning about the fact that CultureInfo has no public constructors. Despite this, the markup is sufficient to register an appropriately typed static resource in the namespace used by the designer, which stops markup references to StaticResource CurrentCulture from complaining in the rest of the app.p  pAt runtime the failure of this markup to create an instance of CultureInfo is irrelevant because the accompanying Startup code assigns it from CultureInfo.CurrentCulturep  precodeusing System.Globalization using System.Windows  namespace ScriptedRoutePlayback    public partial class App  Application        protected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e            base.OnStartupe       Resources[CurrentCulture]  CultureInfo.CurrentCulture          codepre  h2Finally, the questionh2  pWhat is the preferred way to mark up a StaticResource that refers to an existing object such as a singleton obtained from a static property of a class, especially when said class lacks public constructorsp

Negative 10402 pI currently have an Android application that has an intentfilter to receive images from the Gallery. It is important that the images are received in the same order that the user selected them in. This seems to be the default behavior on most devices, however on some devices so far Ive seen this on Motorolas running Android 4.x the order seems undefined. Does anyone know a way to declare in the intent that the images should be received in order Or a way once the images are recieved to determine the selected orderp  pHere is relevant code from the manifestp  precode ltactivity        androidlabelstringappname        androidname.activities.ImportImagesActivity gt         ltintentfiltergt               ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.SEND gt            ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt             ltdata androidmimeTypeimage gt        ltintentfiltergt        ltintentfiltergt               ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.SENDMULTIPLE gt            ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt             ltdata androidmimeTypeimage gt        ltintentfiltergt    ltactivitygt codepre  pAnd from ImportImagesActivityp  precodeprivate ListltUrigt parseIncomingData      ListltUrigt uriList  null      Intent intent  this.getIntent     ifintent  null          String action  intent.getAction         Single Image         if action.equalsIgnoreCaseandroid.intent.action.SEND              removed for brevity                               Multiple Images         else if action.equalsIgnoreCaseandroid.intent.action.SENDMULTIPLE              uriList   intent.getParcelableArrayListExtraIntent.EXTRASTREAM                    more code  at this point images have been recieved      return uriList  codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo give a little context, let me explain the general flow of the app. The user opens the Gallery and selects images. They choose to Share them with my app. My application receives a list of Uris which are then displayed using an internal gallery  backed by a custom Adapter class. The images display correctly based on the Uri list, strongthe issue is the order of the ListltUrigt is sometimes incorrectstrong. It is important to my users that the images appear in the same order they select them in. p  pstrongClarificationstrong When I use the term Gallery I am referring to the built in Android app Gallery.  When I use the term Share I am referring to the the Share button within the Gallery app. This allows the user to select from a list of services such as Facebook, Email, and in this case my app. p  pFor Example imagine a Gallery with 3 images, displayed in an arbitrary order A, B, and C. The user selects first C then A then B and chooses to share them with my app. On most phones my list will be correctly ordered C, A, B, on offending phones this order seems random. p  pI cannot use the creation timestamp because the creation time is generally irrelevant to the selection order. Adding custom meta data doesnt help either because I dont know the correct initial order.  p

Negative 10402 pI am attempting to add the following behavior to JQuery Accordionp  p1 Activate a section of the accordion based on internal page links codesection1code. This means if the user goes to URL codemypage.compage.phptestcode that I would use JS to activate that accordion section.p  p2 Make the headings of each section of the accordion copyable links to the url that would activate said section of the accordion. So if a user right clicks on the section title of the accordion and copied the link location it would put codemypage.compage.phptestcode on the users clipboard.p  hr  pI have 1 figured out, but it is code of my own writing.

If someone would care to point me in the right direction I would prefer using the authors code to my own, but if not, no biggie as this is completed.p  p2 is where I am at a loss.

Negative 10402 pLooking for some insight here... p  pOn my form, I have three ComboBox controls.  When the left most receives a selection, it calls a routine to enable and populate the 2nd, then the same happens for the 3rd when a selection is made in the 2nd.p  precode    Private Sub cboEquipmentSelectedIndexChangedsender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs Handles cboEquipment.SelectedIndexChanged      Me.transData.isMobile  IfMe.cboEquipment.Text  MOBIEQIP, 1, 0      If cboMembership.Enabled  False Then          Me.cboMembership.Enabled  True      End If      Call loadGroups  End Sub codepre  pThe method loadGroupsp  precode    Private Sub loadGroups      Dim cn As New SqlConnectionMy.Settings.MyConnectionString     Dim cm As New SqlCommandSELECT ...

After their initial load, I have to select an item from the list to get values as expected.p  pThe odd part is that once the 2nd or 3rd Combobox have been initialized, they seem to recall last settings.  For example, if I call the Reset method, which sets the .DataSource property to Nothing, clear the list, and set the Text to Nothing the next time I change the SelectedIndex on cboEquipment, the other boxes come back to life with SelectedItems and SelectedValues.  p  pThese values arent wrong according to the new DataTable, but it is odd that they remember at all they shouldnt have any reference, and behave as a fresh load.p  pOther points of interest the populate methods are called during the SelectedIndexChanged event.p  pAny thoughts would be greatp  hr  pUPDATE p  pThis behavior is tied in with the SelectedIndexChange Event bouncing around raise raise raisep  pRemoving and adding event handlers at strategic points has my code working as I wantexpect it to.p  pa hrefhttpwww.fmsinc.comfreeNewTipsNETNETtip12.asp relnofollowHerea is the article that put me on the right path...p

Negative 10402 pIs it possible to use the CreateIndex syntax of EF Code First Migrations to create a Covering Index see below for what a Covering Index is.p  pFor example I can create a simple index in a manual migration like sop  precodeCreateIndexRelatedProduct, RelatedId codepre  pIt has a final argument named anonymous arguments that specifies it can handle whatever the underlying provider supports  but its not clear how I determine what that support would be. Is this possible or do I need to resort to flat SQLp  pA Covering Index is one where the RDB stores duplicated data in the leaf nodes, not just pointers to the main table. Its essentially a duplication of a table reordered by the columns in the index, containing just the columns most used in that type of search.p

Negative 10402 pIm developing an app for windows phone 8 where the user needs to log on, and then the app will post to the wall of the user.p  pIve basically got this figured out, but after the first log on, I havent had to log in again. I tried deleting the browser data on the phone, checked my runtime directory, and tried to log out using FacebookClient.GetLogoutUrl and navigating to it, but it still thinks Im logged in.p  pHow is my login information being storedp  pAnd once I figure that out, is there a good way to determine this at runtime so that my app can configure itself accordinglyp

No change in linked libraries, environmental variables either. This is a VxWorks MIPS64 cross compiler, if that helps. I personally think it shouldnt change. But I observe that sometimes randomly, the instructions generated changes. I dont know whats the reason. Can anyone throw some light on thisp

Negative 10402 pI have a table that shows a month like a calendar. In each cell is a emdiv.fcdaynumberem that contains numerical date, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on to 31. Each cell also has an initially blank emdiv.fcdaycontentem where the event data can be appended. Im using the FullCalendar jQuery script, hence all the fc prefixes in the class names.p  pWithin this calendar are supposed to be links to upcoming events. I have a script that goes through each event to place it on the correct day in the calendar. It goes through each table cell and matches the text of the cell to the event date. An events date is found in emevent.dateem.p  pRight now I have thisp  precodevar tablecell  jaertable.fcborderseparate.finddiv.fcdaynumbercontainsevent.day.siblingsdiv.fcdaycontent codepre  pThe problem is that the emcontainsem selector is not specific enough. An event on March 3 will also appear on 13, 23, 30, and 31 basically any date with a 3 in it.p  pHow can I write the code for tablecell to get an exact match for emevent.dayemp

Negative 10402 pI want to embed tweets in an asp.net applicationpage. Something akin to the wordpress feature where all one has to do is paste the url for tweet in the editor and WP automagically embeds the tweet. Or maybe some sort of shortcode like [tweetnumericStringhere] and then this becomes a nicely formatted tweet. After much googling i have found a couple of potential solutions. One is clients side  a hrefhttpembedtweet.com relnofollowEmbedTweeta which i i just tried but does not work. I know twitter uses OAuth so this script may use their legacy api. The other solution is to work with OEmbed based on what i rad at twitters dev section. So before I start heading a potential blind alley Id like a little direction on what i should i look at to embed tweets with asp.net, Could be a client side solution too. Id rather use use a prebuilt solution but if i have to roll my own i can. Does Linq to Twitter or Twitterizer support embeding tweets Or should I use JSON.net to get the tweet info via JSONp

Negative 10402 pIve been having an issue with Quartz version 1.6 failing to reschedule a long running job after the first completion. There are other jobs that reschedule fine but they do not usually run longer than the reiterate time. Ive been referring to the DB for job status When the job starts it moves to state of BLOCKED, the prevfiretime is set and the nextfiretime is set 1 minute in the future.p  pe.g nextfiretime  9.50, prevfiretime  9.49p  pThe job then doesnt finish until say 9.55. Note The job is responsible for batch updates on a backlog of transactions. Sometimes it takes 10 seconds sometimes it takes 10 minutes but the backlog can get large so we want to avoid setting the interval to 10 minutes.p  pWhen the job finishes the status is set back to WAITING but the nextfiretime remains in the past. Strangly i tried to setup a test in my local enviroment with a job that iterates every 10 seconds and sleeps for 1 minute and the scheduler seemed to handle it ok.p  pWe use a custom Job Details Factory so I dont know if that could impact it.p  pIm hoping for some suggestions on how to fix this.

Negative 10402 pI have generated some java class files using Axis1 axis1.4.jar. I have a WS method call I can see its generated java code too. p  pSay this method call accepts a RequestA as parameter and returns  an object of type ResponseA.

AxisFault on its own turn extends RemoteException.p  pAs a result of this, the ResponseA object returned is not returned  to me but is thrown toat me as it is a RemoteException.p  pSo when I do something like thisp  precodetry      ResponseA x  cally  y is RequestA  catch Exception ex      ex.printStackTrace  codepre  pin my client code, the flow of control goes to the catch block and  I am actually catching what I should normally be getting in the x variable i.e. ex is what x would normally be.p  pAny idea what makes Axis generate my ResponseA class as a subclass of AxisFault Also, in general, when is a class generated by Axis, generated as subclass of AxisFaultp  pI think this is my current problem.

Negative 10402 pIm getting some odd behaviors loading breezejs in an application that also uses requirejs.p  pThe main issue is that if I setup require to load breeze plus its dependencies q and jquery, breeze fails to load unless knockout is setup as a dependency of breeze.  p  blockquote   pUncaught Error Module name ko has not been loaded yet for context   . Use require[]p blockquote  pThats fine if I actually wanted to use knockout, but Im using angular.  I guess it doesnt break anything to load knockout too, but its a waste of time to download if its never going to get used.p  pSo, my first question is why does breeze require knockout just because Im using requirejs  Seems like a bug to me.p  pThe other odd behavior WRT breeze and require is that if I load require and then breeze without using require, then breeze fails to load.  p  blockquote   pUncaught Error Mismatched anonymous define module...p blockquote  pSeems that breeze makes the assumption that if require is loaded, that breeze will be loaded by require.  But, this seems like a leap to assume.  I ran into this issue since I first discovered the previous issue.  I thought Id just load breeze myself instead of having require do it.  Of course, was still loading require since other parts of the app rely on require.  p  pSo, my second question is why does breeze have to be loaded before require  Just seems odd since the two libraries dont depend on each other.  Why is there a required load orderp

Negative 10402 pSo, my company has an iPhone app.  We are publishing the API to our server, and we need to authenticate the client app not the user, we want to know if this is the iPhone app that it claims to be.p  pWhat Id like to be able to do is have the application send our server the public key for the application in the Apple app store as part of its initial request.  Id then like our server to be able to ask the Apple store is this public key the key for the application I think it is  If it is, then we would issue a valid token for all other requests, if not bounce the request. p  pI realize this approach can be spoofed in that someone can just find the public key from a Jailbroken phone and pretend to be the app, but for the initial releases of the app, we dont care because we WANT people to use the app.  Later, we want to give attribution on API requests from partners who are authorized to send requests using the method described above, but for now there is no need to sign or genuinely authorize the requests with 2 or 3 legged oAuth.p  pSo, simply put  o  Is there a way for an iPhone app to ask iOS for the public key used to sign the app  o  Is there a way for a server or other program to ask the Apple store is this public key the key for the app that I think it isp  pIm essentially trying to use the Apple store as an authentication authority.  I know  they are already in that they have to be signed and approved by Apple, but I need a server requesttime validation.p  pThanks ahead of time.p

Negative 10402 pI am trying to get CouchDBlike response from Redis   by using ServiceStack WebServices to access data stored via ServiceStack .Net RedisTypedClient onto Redis.p  pNow the web services are described as providing a CouchDB layer onto Redis. However, unlike equivalent CouchDB calls to a CouchDB, I never get back json but only strings em to be clear I do get back json but with the payload is in string format.emp  pThis applies to getting items from Redis List, Set and HashSet collections. All the items via either the xml,json or csv web services always deliver the payload as a string.  Now I can see the serialized form of the type I stored in the string   such as a json array of strings or whatever, but the emdataem is not delivered as json or csv or xml but as a string. I cannot find a query flag .e.g. formatjson say  in any of the autogenerated documentation for these web services which does say it delivers the payload as a string which is what I see.p  pFurther apart from using the default jsv serializer through RedisTypedCLient I also tried  directly calling the ServiceStack json serializer to serialize as json not jsv and also the Newtonsoft json serializer. None of this makes any difference. I did not expect it too as I imagine the default services would likely only manage the expected jsv version and would deliver anything else as strings. However I did not expect this of the internal serialization format.p  pSo is it possible to get CouchDB like json responses from ServiceStackRedisBuiltinWebServicesp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHere is a typical query via the ServiceStack json web servicep  pa hrefhttpmyserver.comredisjsonsyncreplyGetAllItemsFromListidtest relnofollowhttpmyserver.comredisjsonsyncreplyGetAllItemsFromListidtestap  pThis is a Redis List collection containing strongly typed itemsp  precodetype TestItem gr,eType,pillar,offset      let mutable gr      gr         let mutable eType   eType      let mutable pillar  pillar     let mutable offset  offset     member x.Gr     with get gr     and setv  gr     lt v     member x.EType  with get eType  and setv  eType  lt v     member x.Pillar with get pillar and setv  pillar lt v     member x.Offset with get offset and setv  offset lt v     override x.ToString  sprintf s s s M x.Gr x.EType x.Pillar x.Offset codepre  pThe list collection was added using IRedisTypedClient InterfaceAPI and I am expecting back a json list of json objects  a set of keyvalue pairs each  pair corresponding to one of the four public properties in the type above.

It could be a list of a list of strings.

Negative 10402 pIm currently working in a project that involves the encryption of a few columns in an existing database. There is quite a lot of code already written against the current schema, a lot of which is in the form of custom linqtosql queries. The number of queries is in the neighbourhood of a 5 figure number, so modifying and retesting each and everyone of them would be way too expensive.p  pAn alternative we found is to keep the DB schema the same only altering the columns length slightly, which mean we dont need to change our current entity class definitions and instead, changing the expression trees onthefly, before they reach the l2sql codeIQueryProvidercode, and apply a decryption function on the columns I need. I do this by wrapping the pertinent codeTableltTEntitygtcode properties of my codeDataContextcode with a custom codeIQueryableltTEntitygtcode implementation, which allows me to preview every single query in the system.p  pIn my current implementation, say Ive got this queryp  precodevar mydate  new DateTime2013, 1, 1 var context  new DataContextFactory.GetClientsContext  ExpressionltFuncltstringgtgt foo  context.MyClients.First     c gt c.BirthDay lt mydate.EncryptedColumn codepre  pbut when I catch the query, I change it to readp  precodeExpressionltFuncltstringgtgt foo  context.Decrypt     context.MyClients.Firstc gt c.BirthDay lt mydate.EncryptedColumn codepre  pI do this using the codeExpressionVisitorcode class.

Negative 10402 pSo, on an android tablet Im getting a 404 for siteappletouchicon.png. Which, the 404 makes sense because no such file exists. But whats more, that file is referenced no where in the markup. I understand that apparently this icon can be automatically sought out depending on the inclusion of certain mobilerelated META tags, but no such tags are anywhere in the code either. With the exception of the title, description, and keyword tags the only meta tag in said code is a p  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidth1000gt codepre  pand from what Ive found, this wouldnt cause this 404.p  pAdditionally, the only time said 404 seems to occur is when the user logs in. The user can log in from any page on the site, but navigating such pages normally causes no problems. The login flow takes the user to a designated url, performs validation etc. and then redirects the user back to wherever they came from. No meta tags are output prior to the redirect. But somewhere in this flow, the tablets browser believes it needs to seek out the appletouchicon.png file.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to what might be the culprit Is it the result of a redirect without any output If so, how might I discourage the client from behaving as such Im just at a loss trying to figure out whats causing it.p  pIn case someone thinks it relevant, the site is built with codeigniter, and the redirect is using their core method. Thanks very much for any help.p  pemEDITem To clarify, because I realize this was written poorly my bad, the tablet is NOT getting a RESOURCE 404. The tablets browser is actually navigating to the url of the nonexistent file. The result is a dead page.p

Negative 10402 pSo Im trying to consider the case where a logged in user has say, 2 tabs open, and logs out of my site in one tab but in the other tab since theyre still logged in, and they try to click a button which submits POST data, my function in my view should detect that the user is not authenticated and it should redirect them to the login page. However, I cant seem to get this to work at all. Ive done numerous testing and I know my condition is getting validated correctly, but the redirect just doesnt happen. Below is the code for the form and the code in my view.p  precodeltform methodPOST actiongt  csrftoken   an input button ltformgt   if not request.user.isauthenticated     return HttpResponseRedirectreversedjango.contrib.auth.views.login  otherwise I check if it was request.POST etc and handle a normal request codepre  pIve tried to hard code the url, using the login url specified in my settings file, etc but none of it seems to do anything. Im thinking its all because of the empty action part but I dont think thats the reason.p
Negative 10402 pI have been able to bind the data in my MS Access database to textboxes on a form.  But when I update the data, no changes are made to the database.  I made a simplified example to demonstrate my problem.  The form contains only two textboxes txtFirstName and txtLastName and two buttons Save and Refresh.  Refresh just reloads the DataTable from the database.  I load the record with ID 1 and try to update.  The code is below.  I know that the updates to the textboxes also update the DataTable.  However, the Update function of the data adapter does nothing because no Update commands are generated by the OleDbCommandBuilder.

When a file is uploaded, the Save action of the Attachment controller is fired. This handles the storing of the file and then retrieves the updated list of files for this particular area of the site.

And this is not just for Q, but for entire set of alphabets, regardless of case, so c has its own cluster of possible typo matches etc..p  pIn VB6 setup of UDT user defined type declare UDT type for typosp  precodePublic Type Mytypos     Rightrkey As String  1     PossibleKey As String  8 End Type declare arrays and variable for master list and typos Public Masterlist As String Public Mytypolist26 As Mytypos Public Matchkey As Mytypos codepre  pthe following function  compares two words and assign similarity by calculating currentpct scorep  precodePublic Function CompareCharactersByRef MasterWord As String,  ByRef Checkword As String, ByRef CurrentPCT As Double,  ByRef WordVal As Long As Double  define function variables Dim ChrCount As Long Dim ChrValue As Long Dim loop1 As Long Dim loop2 As Long  define the letter values If LenMasterWord gt LenCheckword Then     ChrCount  LenMasterWord  2 Else     ChrCount  LenCheckword  2 End If  ChrValue  1  ChrCount  say CURRENT PCT has a value of 10  check each letter for a match in current word position For loop1  1 To LenCheckword              check for typo errors key proximity             For loop2  0 To UBoundMytypolist                 Matchkey  Mytypolistloop2                 if indexkey  letter in masterword                 If Matchkey.Rightrkey  MidMasterWord, loop1, 1 Then                     does the letter in the checkword exist in the proximity keylist                     If InStr1, Matchkey.PossibleKey, MidCheckword, loop1, 1, vbTextCompare gt 0 Then                         value for letter found in proximity keylist                         CurrentPCT  CurrentPCT  ChrValue                     End If                     Exit For                 End If             Next loop2  Next loop1 CompareCharacters  CurrentPCT  End Function codepre  pIF you can post me a arrayclass solution that may not produce compiler issues String UDT in VBA are a problem.

Negative 10402 pMoving a discussion on relative merits of integers and floats into a separate question. Here it is what is your preference between an integer type or a floating point type in situations that are neither inherently integral nor inherently floating point For example, when developing geometric engine for a wellconntrolled range of scales would you prefer integer coordinates in the smallest feasible units or floatdouble coordinatesp

Joey Gallo began his criminal career as a smalltime loan shark and jukebox racketeer. He became a top enforcer in the Profaci crime family, but felt he never got the respect he deserved. So Gallo formed his own gang and revolted against mafia Don Joe Profaci in a long, bloody war on the streets of New York. But there was another side to Joey Gallothe ruthless mob leader was also an artist and an avid reader. Living in Greenwich Village with his wife Jeffie, Gallo was inspired by his beatnik neighbors and their counterculture ideas. He also began hobnobbing with New Yorks social elite, befriending everyone from Neil Simon to Jerry Orbach.

SLS 3.2.10 codepre  pstrongUpdate  About Viniciuss Examplestrongp  pRather than try to explain this in comments, here is a demonstration that there is no implicit conversion being called when you use a type with covariant parameter, like codeList[T]code.  Lets say I put this code in a file, compile, and run it...p  precodecase class Foostr String  object StackOver1 extends App     implicit def str2Foos String Foo        printlnIn str2Foo.     new Foos       def test[T]xs List[T], x T List[T]       printlntest   x.getClass     xs       val foo1  new Foofoo1   testListfoo1, abc  codepre  pYoull see that it calls test, but never the implicit conversion from codeStringcode abc to codeFoocode. Instead its picking a codeTcode for codetest[T]code that is a common base class between codeStringcode and codeFoocode.  When you use codeIntcode and codeIntegercode it picks codeAnycode, but its confusing because the runtime representation of the codeIntcode in the list is codeIntegercode. So it looks like it used the implicit conversion, but it didnt.  You can verify by opening a Scala prompt...p  precodescalagt type StackOver1.testListnew java.lang.Integer1, 2 List[Any] codepre
Negative 10402 pI am currently grading for a C class and want to be able to download all the files my students submit and when I click on them they open in Geany so I can compile them really quickly and run them.p  pWhen I ran linux I used Geany as my preferred IDE. Ive switched to Mac and installed Geany via MacPorts. I currently run Geany by opening a terminal and calling it. p  pIs there a way to specify a custom command for a file type or will have to build an application to run Geany. Also how do I do that.

Negative 10402 pI have a codeUITableViewcode and it contains a custom codeUITableViewCellcode. To test, I have an array that has three strings in it. The codeUITableViewcode delegate methods are called as expected, however, the strongtableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathstrong delegate is always passed an codeNSIndexPathcode instance whose row property is always code nilcodep  pcodetableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathcode is called 3 times once for each object in my array. I added the codetableViewcode from within the designer storyboard and created an outlet for it. The UITableViewCell instances appear to be correctly instantiated which each call to this delegate.

I created a UIViewController originally and then added a UITableView to this as the view. In the UITableView I created a custom prototype cell. I did all the house work p  pcodeUIViewControllercode implemented the codeUITableViewDelegatecode amp codeUITableViewDatasourcecode. Created and outlet for the codeUITableViewcode. Hooked up all the outletsp  pEverything seemed to work except for the fact that codeindextPath.rowcode property was always codenilcode. Some resources I found suggested that custom cells were not visible before the uitableview delegates were called. p  pIn the end I made my class a subclass of codeUITableViewControllercode. Things started working. I am still curious why my original attempt was failing. p  pThanks for everyones time. Some great comments helped me investigate some topics that are good to know.   p

Negative 10402 pIn my project I have a prepush git hook that runs unit tests on every push.p  pBut when I try to push changes from one branch while staying at another one, the unit tests will be run for the active branch, not for the currently pushed one. p  pFor example, if I try to push changes from my newfeature branch while my working directory reflects the structure of the develop branch, the prepush hook will run the unit tests for the develop branch, not for the newfeature.p  pThe basic idea to get rid of this is to make a checkout of the currently pushed branch in the prepush hook.

Negative 10402 pThis is more of a question of logic than code, I do believe.p  pI have two rectangles of class RedBlock, referenced by Main.blocks[] and another rectangle of class MainCharacter, whose class this code comes from. The rectangle of class MainCharacter should stop moving when it collides with either of the rectangles in the Block array named blocks. Since it is in a for loop, any if statement inside the block must be true for both instances of Block for it to keep the MainCharacter from moving. Also, since the code is run twice, the movementSpeed seems to be doubled, caused by the setX method being called twice.p  pMy problem, therefore, is that I cannot test collision between one of the two blocks, but only between both blocks at the same time, and that I cannot accurately control the speed of the MainCharacter as it is relative to the number of blocks. Can you tell me what I am doing wrong If you have a superior form of collision detection at hand, feel free to include that in your answer.p  precode    for int i  0 i lt Main.blocks.length  1 i          if Main.blocks[i]  null              if Keyboard.isKeyDownKeyboard.KEYD                  if Math.absgetRight  Main.blocks[i].getLeft lt movementSpeed                         ampamp getBottom lt Main.blocks[i].getTop                         ampamp getTop gt Main.blocks[i].getBottom                      setXgetX  Math.absgetRight  Main.blocks[i].getLeft                  else                      setXgetX  movementSpeed                               else if Keyboard.isKeyDownKeyboard.KEYA                  if Math.absgetLeft  Main.blocks[i].getRight lt movementSpeed                         ampamp getBottom lt Main.blocks[i].getTop                         ampamp getTop gt Main.blocks[i].getBottom                      setXgetX  Math.absgetLeft  Main.blocks[i].getRight                  else                      setXgetX  movementSpeed                               if Keyboard.isKeyDownKeyboard.KEYS                  if Math.absgetBottom  Main.blocks[i].getTop lt movementSpeed                         ampamp getLeft lt Main.blocks[i].getRight                         ampamp getRight gt Main.blocks[i].getLeft                      setYgetY  Math.absgetBottom  Main.blocks[i].getTop                  else                      setYgetY  movementSpeed                               else if Keyboard.isKeyDownKeyboard.KEYW                  if Math.absgetTop  Main.blocks[i].getBottom lt movementSpeed                         ampamp getLeft lt Main.blocks[i].getRight                         ampamp getRight gt Main.blocks[i].getLeft                      setYgetY  Math.absgetTop  Main.blocks[i].getBottom                  else                      setYgetY  movementSpeed                                        else return      codepre

Negative 10402 pThis is a simple problem that someone surely knows how to solve.p  pI have a WPF application that compiles perfectly fine.p  pI decided to add functionality to the ListView, so I extended the ListView class as ListViewEx.p  pI went into my XAML code and changed all the ListView tags to ListViewEx.p  pNow the application will not compile, claiming ListViewEx does not exist.  But it doesnt exist, because it hasnt been compiled yet, and it wont compile because the XAML doesnt think it exists yetp  pThe only way I can get it to compile is to completely remove all tags referencing the new class from the XAML, compile the project so the new class exists whereever the XAML is looking for it, and then I can add the tags back and it will compile fine.p  pIs this behavior by designp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaeOwQ.png altCircular Dependencyp  pNotice four things.p  ol liListViewEx does in fact exist in the FilePublisher namespace. contradicts error messageli liThe MainForms XAML declare the FilePublisher namespace as pli lipListViewEx is referenced in the XAMLli lilstFile does exist in MainForm see XAML tag NamelstFiles contradicts error messageli ol  pThe problem is that the XAML designer is referencing the DLL its trying to compile.  Its expecting ListViewEx to already exist, and because it hasnt been compiled yet, it does not exist in the DLL.  As a result, the designer is not automatically generating the lstFiles property on the main forms partial class like it should, and as a result, the project will not compile because the code references lstFiles.  So it wont compile, because something doesnt already exist in the very thing its trying to compile  That is a circular dependency, and its reproducible 100 of the time.p

The book that Ive been using C 2010 AllinOne for Dummies has a sample of a custom command but it uses hard coded information to complete its task and I dont see how to use the Command system to complete emmyem task.p  pstrongBook Codestrongp  precodepublic abstract class CommandBase  ICommand      public string Text  get internal set       public abstract void Executeobject parameter      public abstract bool CanExecuteobject parameter      public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged              add  CommandManager.RequerySuggested  value          remove  CommandManager.RequerySuggested  value         public class AddCustomerCommand  CommandBase      public AddCustomerCommand              Text  Add Customer           public override void Executeobject parameter              var list  parameter as IListltCustomergt         if list  null                      return                  list.Addnew Customer  ID  4, Name  New Customer            public override bool CanExecuteobject parameter              return parameter is IListltCustomergt       codepre  pIn this case, codeExecutecode works because it is passed an codeIListltCustomergtcode and can add to it without needing to return anything. This makes perfect sense to me.p  pstrongMy Problemstrongp  pI have an MVVM app that has a data grid, some text boxes, and some buttons. My view model has codeIListltEntrygt Entriescode, properties for the text boxes, and of course an instance of my custom command codeAddEntryCommandcode. The goal is to be able to enter text, and hit add, and have a new codeEntrycode be added to codeEntriescode using codeAddEntryCommandcode.p  pWhat I dont understand is how to go about getting codeEntriescode and the new data into the command. Here are the possible solutions Ive thought of and what I see wrong with themp  ol liPass in the view model so that all its information is available.li liPass in an array of objects.li lipPass in a codeTuplecode.p  ul liPassing thew view model seems excessive, and if I do that then everything on the view model would have to be mutable.li liI try and avoid using codeobjectcode whenever possible, and codeobject[]code seems even more work to deal with. Id have to pick it apart like command line arguments.li liTuples... li liMy idea of a command is that its supposed to be a method with bells and whistles for making the UI react nicely. Anything that causes the command to be tied to a specific view or view model breaks that.li ulli ol  pSo my questions arep  pstrongHow do you do work with multiple objects using codeICommandcodestrongp  pstrongHow can you use codeICommandcode to work with immutable objects if its locked to return codevoidcodestrongp  pstrongIs my idea of what a command is for way off basestrongp  pIve tried searching for a better tutorial or resource for this but my Google fu is weak and I cant seem to locate anything thats clear and concise. There are lots of questions on SO about commands in WPF, but theyre all for very specific implementations. Im looking for a general answer regarding manipulating multiple objects in one command.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI have been looking around the net some more but I still havent found anything like the sample provided by my book. I have looked at codeDelegateCommandcode and that seems like a pretty straightforward and easy to use system. It still leaves me wondering why such a large chunk of the chapter on MVVM would be dedicated to creating a custom command using just codeICommandcode and not one of the other classes that already inherit from it.p

Negative 10402 pI had been tasked with writing a script that takes two ini files and merges them, one being the original and the second and more authoritative one being the change file. So basically anything thats new in the change file gets added, and anything thats a duplicate gets changed. And it works.... but not really how I expected. p  pI basically decided to do a diff on the sections using a list, and then iterate over that list and add in the deltas, but the behavior Im seeing is hard for me to explain. Currently if there are no section changes nothing gets changed, that makes sense since you cant iterate over a list of nothing. However if even one new section gets added it merges all the option values from all over the other sections, changed or not. Which in a nut shell is what I want but I dont understand why, except for the fact that no new sections are present in the change file youd have to add just a dummy entry to get it to actually parse. p  pHeres my codep  precodeusrbinenv python Import Config Parser and modules, sys can be removed Id like to keep it for debugging for future versions  from ConfigParser import SafeConfigParser import sys, argparse    Voyager Parser                Written March 2014            Clifford Trueman               NAME   voyagerparser VERSION0.1 USAGE  .voyagerparser i ltinputfilegt c ltchangefilegt o ltoutputfilegt SUMMARYScript to merge changes from PCE and GOI   parsecli  argparse.ArgumentParserdescriptionvoyagerparser To read in and merge GOI and PCE change inis parsecli.addargumenti, input, helpInput original GOI file name,requiredTrue parsecli.addargumentc, change, helpInput PCE derived ini file for changes,requiredTrue parsecli.addargumento, output, helpOutput, requiredTrue   Define our global variables Define two parsers so we can work with multiple files args          parsecli.parseargs parser        SafeConfigParser parser2       SafeConfigParser list1         [] list2         [] inputfile1   args.input inputfile2   args.change outputfile   args.output     Define our Functions    Figuring out section diffs, Source  change files input and change file order matters def readfilesectionsinputfile, comparelist     parser.readinputfile     for merge in parser.sections         comparelist.appendmerge     return comparelist  Take what we found to be different then add it def adddeltasectionsdeltalist, outputfile     for delta in deltalist         parser2.addsectiondelta         parser.writesys.stdoutcomment in for debugging         parser.writeopenoutputfile, w     return     Call our functions    get a list of the sections in both ini files  readfilesectionsinputfile1, list1 readfilesectionsinputfile2, list2  Find out what that difference is deltalist  listsetlist2setlist1 print deltalist Call this to add in the changes we found adddeltasectionsdeltalist, outputfile   name  main codepre

Negative 10402 pI recently needed to run Create Tables AND Update Tables scripts using SMO on my applications MSSQL backend and found out not surprisingly that you cannot simply replace the CREATE TABLE statement with an ALTER TABLE as you can with Stored Procedures...p  pSo I went about finding out how SSMS does it by changing a table and simply selecting Generate Change Script on the table. I then used this change script to determine what my function requires in order to make this more generalised and using the entire list of tables in my CREATE TABLE script file for a new installation.p  pFor anyone interested, below under Answers is my Function In VB.NET using SMO. Its in no means perfect, but I hope you will find it a good starting point if not solution to the same problem.p

Negative 10402 pI read an example from an older StackOverflow post about when to use stackalloc. Now this example has me a bit puzzledp  precodepublic unsafe void DoSomeStuff      byte unmanaged  stackalloc byte[100]     byte[] managed  new byte[100]      Do stuff with the arrays      When this method exits, the unmanaged array gets immediately destroyed.     The managed array no longer has any handles to it, so it will get      cleaned up the next time the garbage collector runs.     In the meantime, it is still consuming memory and adding to the list of crap     the garbage collector needs to keep track of. If youre doing XNA dev on the     Xbox 360, this can be especially bad.  codepre  pNow feel free to correct me if Im wrong, as Im still quite a novice in C and programming in general. But arent bytes value types And arent value types stored where they are declared Doesnt this mean that in this example, codemanagedcode is also stored on the stack, and by extension when this stack frame finishes and it goes to the calling adress the memory is cleaned up automatically and therefore codemanagedcode should be removed in the same manner as codeunmanagedcode in this examplep

And there may be URLs in the email that should point to the client application.p  hr  pAnother option is instead of the API service sending the activation email, it will return the activation key to the client application. The client application will then be able to send the activation email to the user.p  pstrongTwo issues I see with this strategystrongp  ul liSecurity, as the activation key is now exposed to the client application.li liNot DRY, as each client could be responsible for email sending.li ul  pstrongWhat do you think is best way to handle thisstrongp  pI would like to allow the client application to customize their email, as well as include clientspecific URLs activation page.p

Negative 10402 pIm creating an application that has hips of bundles. Some of them are interfaces and some are implementation of those interfaces. Im using declarative services DS to provide and use services, which means that each bundle has a component.xml describing the services Im providingreferencing.p  pCurrently I have a class called codeClockWidgetcode that implements 3 interfaces as you can see in the attached diagram.

For example, the codeTimeoutcode class has bind methods that receives anyone who implements the codeTimeoutListenercode service. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG0A6u.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe problem is that the constructor of the codeClockWidgetcode class is being called three times.

Negative 10402 pHi I have been chasing an error in my office code since a week now. It relates to Spring, Hibernate and Transactions.p  pWhat I knowbr 1. Lazy Loading.br 2. How Spring uses proxies and interceptor for its Transaction management.br 3. Transaction propagation in Spring and that our code uses the default REQUIRED.br 4. Session per requestconversation and the detached entity fundamentals of Hibernate to keep the session and the fact that ours is not session per conversation.  p  pMy scenario A method in my code written by someone else uses Transactional  call it method a and calls another service method that loads a customer from DB using Hibernate  call it method b. b also has Transactional on it. Customer has many Lazy fields and by the time the control comes back to method a  the lazy fields cant be loaded because the session is closed. What I dont understand is  why was the session closed when method a has not yet finished What does Spring do with the session when b finishes I dont mind being pointed to a web address.p  pI have more questions because I am messing around with this for a week now but wouldnt like to dirty this post without understanding whats going on with the session.p  pPlease suggest.p

Negative 10402 pI am new to python and trying to add a project folder to the PYTHONPATH. I created a .pth file and add my root path of the file in my sitepackages folder. However, when I trying to import the .py files in this folder, only those located under the root folder for example sample can be imported, but those subfolders under the sample folder were not able to be imported for example sample01. So my question is what file and how to change it to make my whole folder including all its subfolders can be importable.p  pIn the worst case I can think of is to write down all the folders name in the .pth file in sitepackages. But I just believe that Python will provide a more efficient way to achieve that. p

Negative 10402 pI have a program which simulates movement of entities on a 2D mash. It runs a sequence of operations in several iterations. All of the operations work with the mesh and some of them need thread synchronization of some kind. I have experience with pthreads, there I know what is happening, but this time I have to use OpenMP.p  pMy problem is that I dont know and I couldnt even find any mentions on the internet if I can use OpenMP directives in functions. All examples of OpenMP use just one function and all calls to other functions are independent on all threads. My intention is to create all threads once and than run everything in parallel multiple times. I know that each of the functions will be called numberofthreads times in each iteration that is desired the synchronization and worksplitting should be handled inside those functions.p  pThe program crashes often with Segmentation Fault usually in finishStep function or somewhere in printPopulation. It is impossible to debug with gdb. An example of a crash attributes xStart, xEnd are only set when the program startsp  precode0x0000000000401d7d in printPopulations world0x607030 at apocalypse.c210 210             Tile currentCell  GETTILEworld, x, y gdb bt 0  0x0000000000401d7d in printPopulations world0x607030 at apocalypse.c210 1  0x0000000000401ef0 in printStatistics world0x607030 at apocalypse.c253 2  0x0000000000402126 in main.ompfn  at apocalypse.c316 3  0x00007ffff78cef3e in   from usrliblibgomp.so.1 4  0x00007ffff7475124 in startthread  from usrliblibpthread.so.0 5  0x00007ffff71a94bd in clone  from usrliblibc.so.6 gdb info locals currentCell  0x7ffff71360f9 ltGIIOdowrite25gt y  414 humans  0 x  1511828487  this is weird y  2 x  2 humans  800 codepre  pThis is simplified version of my codep  precodeWorld  w  ... pragma omp parallel numthreadsnumThreads defaultshared    for int i  0 i lt iters i      simulateStepw     finishStepw     printPopulationsw     pragma omp single  this should synchronize everything     printftime dn, wgtclock      cleanup  each thread cleans its own threadprivate global variable.  codepre  pSimulate step contains two nested for loops.

Negative 10402 pFirebases Simple Login feature includes the a hrefhttpswww.firebase.comdocswebguideloginpassword.html relnofollowability to log users in with Email amp Password.ap  pThis feature is very useful, and is very simple to use. However, in my attempt to implement this into a clientonly web app, I seem to have identified a problem that could be addressed by Firebase easily. p  pHowever, I trust myself very little, and I always presume that I am being an idiot. So I decided to post it as a question here, instead of contacting Firebase directly, so that smart people can correct me and suggest me smart ways to deal with the seeming issue that I have come acrossp  pemHeres my thoughtemp  pThere is a big issue that Firebasess Email simple login does not have an email confirmation feature. This means that users can create email amp password accounts without actually having control of the email address.p  pThis is a common pain point, and the most prevalent solution seems to create the user account with a random password, and immediately send them a password reset email so that they can set their own password if and only if they have control of the email.p  pHowever, since the app is clientside, even the random password assignment has to be done on clientside. Further, this does not stop someone from using the javascript command to simply creating themselves a user account with a defined. i.e. users can still create accounts with email addresses they do not own.p  pEmail confirmation is crucial to building a secure clientside webapp, and I propose an easy solutionp  pFirebase can have an optional setting in the simple login dashboard that, when enabled, strongonlystrong allows users to be created without a working password. This way, users cannot use javascript codes to create themselves accounts with other peoples email, and developers can truly make a secure clientside app by creating a user without a working password, and sending them a passwordreset email, only allowing accounts with valid email addresses.p  pI, in my limited understanding, believe that this would be easy for Firebase to implement, yet very important for developers. However, I would not be surprised if there is already a way to limit accounts to valid email addresses, and I am just being silly.p  pPlease enlighten mep

Negative 10402 pI am trying to upload some daily files in .csv format into a MySQL database using the following queryp  precodeload data local infile CUsersuserDesktopok.csv  ignore into table db.table fields terminated by , codepre  pThe special thing about these files is that they have to update the table in which they are loaded.p  pThe content of these files are rows as followsp  precodeid,status,createdat,solvedat codepre  pBut some of the files have duplicate ids with different status values.p  pAn example ideal workflow would be the followingp  pFile1.csvp  blockquote   p1,Open,20141114,Nullp      p2,Open,20141115,20141115p      p3,Closed,20141001,20141115p      p1,Closed,20141114,20141115p blockquote  pDesired result in the databasep  precodegt 1,Closed,20141114,20141115   gt 2,Open,20141115,20141115  gt 3,Closed,20141001,20141115 codepre  pI have already tried some migration techniques such as storing hash files containing the status of the database in each migration, but the import of the .csv files does not make the correct updates because there are some cases in which in one same file there are various duplicate ids.p  pI also saw that while using codeload data local infilecode, the .csv files rows are uploaded from bottom to top, so for example in this casep  blockquote   p1,A,20141114,Nullp      p1,B,20141115,20141115p      p3,C,20141001,20141115p      p1,D,20141114,20141115p blockquote  pThe result in the database will be the followingp  blockquote   p3,C,20141001,20141115p      p1,A,20141114,Nullp blockquote  pSo maybe if I could manage to somehow at least flip the .csv file upside down, which is a quick and dirty solution but might do the work.p
Negative 10402 pId like to ask for some help because Ive been trying to solve this for some time now. Ive read a hrefhttplostechies.comderickbailey20120405compositeviewstreestructurestablesandmore relnofollowDerick Baileys blog posta on tree structures and CompositeViews. I also read a hrefhttpdavidsulc.comblog20130203tutorialnestedviewsusingbackbonemarionettescompositeview relnofollowDavid Sulcsa but I have what I think is a slightly different use case than the one described there. Note My project uses Marionette.js 1.0.3.p  pI am trying to build something that will work like an inbox with emails displayed in a table. An email may be a thread, meaning that it will have other emails that are linked to it. The inbox view is being rendered in a codelttablegtcode where each codelttrgtcode is an email. My JSON looks likep  precode[   id 1, subject One, threads [],   id 2, subject Two, threads [     id 3, subject Three, threads [],     id 4, subject Four, threads []   ],   id 5, subject Five, threads [] ] codepre  pMy views are configured like thisp  precodeInboxView  Marionette.CompositeView.extend    edited for brevity   initialize functionoptions      this.itemView  EmailView       edited for brevity   EmailView  Marionette.CompositeView.extend    edited for brevity   tagName tr,   initialize functionoptions      this.collection  this.model.getthreads   ,   onRender function      if this.model.isThread this.el.addClassthread       edited for brevity  codepre  pThe issue Im having is that if I let CompositeView work its magic for me by rendering the model once and then the collection of threads once, I end up with two table rows codelttrgtcode one for each thread inside the codelttrgtcode for the original email parent.p  pThere exists functionality in the codeInboxViewcode and codeEmailViewcode that Im trying to reuse. What Im trying to end up with is a table that has all rows shown at the same level.p  pIf youre reading this and want to help me, thank you in advancep

Negative 10402 pOver the last 6 months our test team have been using selenium webdriver to test our web based products.  We have had great success with it and continue to use it on a daily basis.  We use visual studio since we are a .net shop to write our c unit tests.  We dont use any other testing frameworks for .net. We have up until recently been running our automation tests manually through the test explorer window in visual studio 2013, checking on the results and then logging them into a spread sheet.  I know this isnt ideal but we dont have that many tests so this has suited us fine thus far.  However, the number of automation tests we will be required to write and maintain is due to rapidly increase over the next few months.  p  pI have recently been playing around with creating batch files for calling vstest.console.exe and its various commands and then adding those logs to a server.  Not ideal.  I know I can still do so much more, specifically integrate some sort of CI server.  p  pWe are already using team foundation server and have various virtual servers all running windows 8.1 at our disposal so I thought about taking advantage of this so I began looking into Jenkins.  Trouble is, Im not finding much information regarding Jenkinks and c.  It looks primarily geared to a java setup.  Am I missing something  What little information I have found is seriously outdated and didnt work for me.p  pI got as far as setting it up and installing the vstest.console.exe plugin but couldnt get a simple test to run.  A current step by step guide that doesnt predate 2012 would be great   Do you guys think Jenkins is the way to go for c and the .net framework  Is there a standard used within the c community  I have heard of cruise control and Im going to check that out.

Negative 10402 pThis is probably a complicated one, but Ill give it a try.  We have a Rails app  peertopeer marketplace with lots of registered users in beta testing. Users have many items for sale and swap. User will get offers from other users that want to buy or swap their items for users items. Those items might also be wished by other users.

Hard deleting and codedependent destroycode is not an option, because it will break the user experience to other registered users.p  pThe only thing that comes to mind is to add codedeletedcode strongboolean field to users tablestrong and to create a check function if the user was deleted, including this function basically everywhere in the app just to make sure that this user wasnt soft deleted and to display a greyed out user name that is not clickable anymore. That approach will probably take too long to implement and will be pretty hard to maintain.p  pAny advice for better approach will be appreciated.

Instead, I only see the output stream being generated in my developer console.

A simple recalculation didnt make excel rediscover the contents but when I used one of my input toggles to display a different value in those cells, and the went back to the original it did manage to find it.p  pMaybe using find for this is bad style, the find formula has these kind of hicups usually or any other comments on this For now everything works fine again, but Im afraid of running into these issues again. Any tips would thus still be appreciated.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong from comment belowp  pWe have a dynamic range G43J60 where unique identifiers are listed in column G and data is to the right. if something is changed in the data part of the range AND the lines uniqued identifier in column G matches the one in cell H39 a sub is triggered via worksheet change intersecttarget, adjrng Defining that adjrng is the part that throws errors when find returns null.p

Negative 10402 pI have a file that gets new lines appended to it frequently. I want to create a web application running in the browser using javascript that will be able to detect changes on that local file and print the new content that is added on the file.p  pMy solution includes using javascript polling with setInterval and the new HTML5 File API. I load the file using an input file field and then poll the size of the file. Each time the size changes in my case increases this indicates to me that new content has been added to the file. I then slice the file using a Blob and only take the content that was appended using the old file size as start and the new file size as end.p  pGenerally it works good with an average interval Im using 500ms but Im curious if theres a better solution cause this one sounds a bit like a hack to me.p

Negative 10402 pThis question sounds more difficult than it actually is.p  pI wonder, how I can plot a mathematical function with juliap  pUntil now I used Gadfly to plot. I now want to play around with a function constrained optimization on convex functions but I cant find a way to define it.p  pE.g. I want to do p  precodeplot layeryx21 , layeryx4x3,, codepre  pI know that there is a optimization package, however I want to understand and therefore do it myself. For that I just want to be able to draw any function also multivariate functions.p  pSo, how can I do this Is this even possible in Gadfly or do I need to use another plotting libraryp  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 10402 pSorry if this question is a little general. p  pI am developing a basic Raspberry Pi timer to turn things on an off nothing new.p  pThere seems to be two approach. p  ol lipUse SQL and PHP to create a database and PHP to create the user interface. Then a basic Python script that polls the SQL database and acts on the timing events. Turning things off and on. pli lipUse a modern Python framework like Bottle or Flask to provide the interface to a python script to connects to a database like SQLite or Redis.  pli ol  pMy question is p  pIn option 2 can those frameworks be used to provide the same level of functionality as PHP for the database management. Record creation and deletion etc. p  pIn option 1 is there a way to get live interaction with the Pi going. As in buttons that turn things on and off as well as provide live status back from the Python script showing values of various variables like temp values or GPIO values. p  pWhat route would you take if building something similar Basic timing control and some temp logging. p  pMany thanks and sorry again for the generic overview. p  pTp

Negative 10402 pIm planning a database schema, and Ive encountered a situation where I dont know the best way to proceed. Im really looking for a list of pros and cons to each of my proposed solutions, perhaps followed by a recommendation for which would conform to best databasing practice.p  pSo, the problem is that I have two entities with emmultipleem manytomany relationships between them. The two tables are Teams and People a Team is composed of many People, and a Person could have one or many roles on the Team. Roles include team leader, team member, team follower, etc. A person may have more than one role for a particular team, but ideally a subset of these roles are mutually exclusive, while the rest are not.p  pHere are the solutions Ive consideredp  p1 Create a separate junction table for each role. The presence of a row in each table signifies that a single person belongs to a single team, and the particular table indicates the persons role on the team. Mutually exclusive roles would have to be enforced at the application level. p  p2 Create a single junction table and store an enumeration on that table to specify which role a person has. A given personteam combo may have multiple rows in this table, one for each role that the person has with the team. Mutual exclusivity of certain roles would have to be enforced on the application level.p  p3 Create a single junction table, and store a list of boolean flags on the table, one for each role. Each personteam combo has a single row in the table, and the flags determine which roles the user has on that team. Mutual exclusivity could be enforced at the database level, because all mutually exclusive roles could share a single enumerated field on the table.p  p4 Create two junction tables. This is sort of a combination of 2 and 1 that allows mutual exclusivity to be enforced at the database level. There would be one junction table with an enumeration for mutually exclusive roles, and the other junction table with enumeration would handle all nonexclusive roles.p  pIs there anything Im forgetting Which option seems the most naturalp  pThanksp

So if the index doesnt exist i.e. if the index in question is 1 greater than the size of the list, Ill obviously get an codeIndexError list out of rangecode before the inline conditional can assign the variablep  precodeIn [145] myList  [1,2]  In [146] x  foo if myList[2] is not None else bar  IndexError                                Traceback most recent call last ltipythoninput14629708b8c471egt in ltmodulegt gt 1 x  foo if myList[2] is not None else bar  IndexError list index out of range codepre  pChecking the length of the list beforehand is not really an option, since I cant know which value Im interested in is missing i.e. codemyListcode can be missing any or all of three possible values. Knowing that it contains only one, or two, or three elements does not help.p  pstrongUpdatestrong the reason why I cant assign based on the length of the list is as follows. The list can have a maximum size of 3, and strongorder is importantstrong. The values populated will be the result of three separate calls to an API. If all calls to the API succeed, I get a full list, and everything is fine. Yet if only two return a value, the list only contains two items, yet strongI cannot know which API call has led to the missing itemstrong, so assigning variables is pot luck.p  pSo, long story short How can I check for a nonexistent list item at a certain index, while getting to keep Pythons oneline conditionalp

Negative 10402 pIts entirely possible that I am doing something wrong butp  pHeres the story. I have a standard, beginnerslevel, RoR setup 4.2 with ActiveJob jobs.p  pOne of my jobs calls a method on the record thats been passed in which is intended to modify that record. Pretty normal so far. It looks something like thisp  precodeclass GenericScraperJob lt ActiveJobBase   def performrecord      perform job with record data     record.updatemyself   end  end codepre  pAnd then the codeupdatemyselfcode method looks like thisp  precodeclass RecordInDb lt ActiveRecordBase    def updatemyself        thisisacolumn  newvalue        self.save     end  end codepre  pNow heres the mystery  when I run tests, and check that codefixtureinstance.thisisacolumncode is codenewvaluecode, the test passes. When I start my app, and see what happens in the database, it is emnotem updated as expected.p  pBUT if I say codeself.thisisacolumn  newvaluecode, then it works correctly everywhere.p  pI am sure I reloaded my fixture... I did it like this codefixtureinstance  RecordinDb.findfixtureinst.idcodep  pIt is as if the binding inside the ActiveRecord instance changes, depending on when it was instantiated. Inside my tests, it looks like symbols are being treated as possible messages to send to codeselfcode but in the job, they are being treated as local names. Whyp

Negative 10402 pI am training the gensim LDA model on about 1000 documents in batch mode by setting codeupdateevery0code. I then use the model to determine the topic coverage of a document. p  pcodelda[document]codep  pThis returns the topic coverages of the document.p  pI have trained about 1000 different models on the same data and recorded each models codelda[document]code topic coverage estimation for the document. p  pEach model gives similar topic coverages, but there is quite a bit of variability. For example, suppose we only have 2 topics. The first model might say that the coverage of the document is 0.4 topic 1 and 0.6 topic 2. The next model might say 0.1 topic 1 and 0.9 topic 2. In general, over many models, a pattern emerges the coverage of topic 1 lt the coverage of topic 2. However, there is much variation in the coverages from each model.p  pI want to know how should I set the parameters to reduce this variabilityp  pCould it be that the number of iterations for training or the default convergence threshold is too small Alternatively, I was under the impression that number of passes would not matter if I was using batch training, but perhaps I am mistaken It looks like the possible arguments are  passes, iterations, the convergence threshold, alpha, gammathreshold, minimumprobability this is for batch updateevery0, so chunksize, etc, do not apply. From the Gensim a hrefhttpsradimrehurek.comgensimmodelsldamodel.html relnofollowdocumentationap  pcodegensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModelcorpusNone, numtopics100, id2wordNone, distributedFalse, chunksize2000, passes1, updateevery1, alphasymmetric, etaNone, decay0.5, offset1.0, evalevery10, iterations50, gammathreshold0.001, minimumprobability0.01codep  pHow to set these to reduce the variability in the models I do know that there is going to be some variability because variables are randomly initialized this is desirable variability, but I have a feeling that something is not set correctly.p  pOf course, I am trying different combinations and seeing if it improves fidelity of the model, but I thought maybe someone had some experience with this Thanks. p

This suggests to me that Im not really doing this the best possible way.  Should I be creating a more specific pattern for the hex ids  I think I need the SPACE between loglevel and logtype because of the extra space between INFO and METERING in the log, but that also feels kludgy.  p  pAlso how do I get the logs timestamp to replace the timestamp that seems to be the time logstash ingested the log, which we dont wantneed.p  pObviously Im just getting started with ELK and grok, so pointers to useful resources are also appreciated.p

Negative 10402 pIm new to web development, and coming from the world of java and android I have a few questions. Im using asp.net. p  ol liLets assume I have a simple webpage with a label showing a number and a button. When any user presses the button, the number gets incremented automatically for all the users viewing the site, even if they do not refresh the page. Would I use sessions to achieve this or there another concept I should look intoli liI have 2 types of counters which I store in a mysql table with the following schema. li ol  pcodeCounterIDcode codeIncrementValuecodep  pEach counter is active for a set amount of time and only one instance of a counter can be active at one point in time. After this time, the counter is reset to 0 and a new instance of the counter is created. I store all the instances which are active as well as past instances in a table with this schema. p  pcodeInstanceIDcode codeCounterIDcode codeCounterValuecode codeStatusActiveCompletecode codeTimeRemainingcodep  pWhen a user opens a page dedicated to one of the two counter types, the information about the current running instance of that counter needs to be loaded. Would I just execute a SQL query to achieve this and read the information for active counters every time the counter page is loaded or is there a way in which I can store this information on the site so that the site knows which instance is currently active and does not require an SQL query for each request using a global variable concept  Obviously, the situations described above are just simplified examples which I use to explain my issue.p

Negative 10402 pWe decided to use POST method and JSON format for all of our internal APIs which makes everything simpler. But then we realized that this is not truly RESTful. More over it seems that GET requests are more lightweight than POSTs under high load. p  pWe have a problem regarding GET methods. We have to bind our criteria object to the HTTP request query string which forces us to build a hrefhttpswww.playframework.comdocumentation2.2.xScalaForms relnofollowForma object for each criteria model.

Negative 10402 pLets say we have the following list being populated by ngrepeatp  ul liAli liBli liCli ul  pand we use a filter which removed emAem and emCem.
