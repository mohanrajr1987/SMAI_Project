Positive 2531 pI am trying to convert 5 digits of zipcode into 27 digits of barcodecomposed with 0 and 1 and vice versa. The first and last digits of the bar code are always 1. Removing these leave 25 digits. Split into 5 digits each, from left to right the digits encode the values 7, 4, 2, 1, 0. If multiplied by the corresponding value with the digit and compute the sum, we can get first number of zipcode. For example, 25 digits of barcodes are 10100 10100 01010 11000 01001, the zipcode would be 99504. p  p1 x 7  7p  p0 x 4  0p  p1 x 2  2p  p0 x 1  0p  p0 x 0  0p  psum    9p  precode main.cpp  include ltiostreamgt include ltiomanipgt  include ZipCode.h  using namespace std  int main       ZipCode zip199504      ZipCode zip212345     ZipCode zip367890     ZipCode zip4100101010011100001100110001     ZipCode zip5110100001011100001100010011     ZipCode zip6100011000110101000011100101      cout ltlt Digits ltlt         ltlt Bar Code ltlt endl     cout ltlt zip1.getZipCode ltlt setw35 ltlt zip1.getBarCode ltlt endl     cout ltlt zip2.getZipCode ltlt setw35 ltlt zip2.getBarCode ltlt endl     cout ltlt zip3.getZipCode ltlt setw35 ltlt zip3.getBarCode ltlt endl     cout ltlt endl     cout ltlt zip4.getZipCode ltlt setw35 ltlt zip4.getBarCode ltlt endl     cout ltlt zip5.getZipCode ltlt setw35 ltlt zip5.getBarCode ltlt endl     cout ltlt zip6.getZipCode ltlt setw35 ltlt zip6.getBarCode ltlt endl     return 0  codepre  pNow here is my question In codegetZipCodeint numcode, how do I compare each integer value and evaluate as barcode For example, in codemaincode, it says codeZipCode zip199504code.

Positive 2531 pIm still fairly new to Python and I just dont get whats wrong here.p  pI get an codeIndexError list index out of rangecode in the middle of reading lines from a CSV file. The file has 135k lines of data. After the code has processed line 38.715 I receive aforementioned error for the code line with the codeprintcode function. I dont get what is causing this, as there are no problems with any lines before that one, and the structure or type of the data doesnt change. Im running Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit in VMware btw.p  pNote the codestrintrow[2]code is just to remove preceding 0s so I can compare the string to another string afterwards. p  pThis is my codep  precodeimport csv with openhomejoakimDesktopSomeFile.csv, r as fid     freader  csv.readerfid, delimiter     for row in freader         print C.id, row[0], PR.id, row[1], Id, strintrow[2] codepre  pCan anyone point me in any directionp

Positive 2531 pIn Javascript I have a function that should find the elements on the page that have the connected class, and when a button is clicked the classes for these elements are cleared. I have written this codep  precodevar prevconnected  document.getElementsByClassNameconnected if prevconnected.length gt 0      for var j  0 j lt prevconnected.length j          prevconnected[j].removeAttributeclass       codepre  pHowever, it only ever deletes the class attribute of the first connected element on the page. When I have two connected elements, I have confirmed that the prevconnected array does hold 2 values, but for some reason the for loop never reaches the 2nd one.

The big 70Mb assembly is actually a GUIless code that operates with sockets and implements parsers of a proprietary protocols. In my current project I have only 3 GUI forms, with total number of GUI controls lt 100.p  pI suppose my case is closer to the fact that in Windows XP the process address space is limited with 2 GB memory and, taking into account memory segmentation, it is possible that I dont have a free segment large enough to allocate a memory.  However, it is hard to believe that segmentation could be so big after just 23 hours of working with the project in Visual Studio. Task Manager shows that VS consumes about 400500 Mb OM  VM. During compilation, VS need to load only metadata. Well, there are a lot of classes and interfaces in that library, but still I would expect that 12 Mb is more then enough to allocate strongmetadatastrong that is used by compiler to find all public classes and interfaces though it is only my suggestion, I dont know what exactly happens inside CLR when it loads assembly metadata.p  pIn addition, I would say that entire assembly size is so big only because it is C CLI library that has other ummanaged libraries statically linked into one DLL. I estimated using Reflector that .NET managed code is approx 510 of this assembly.p  pAny ideas how to define the real reason of that bug Are there any restrictions or recommendations as to .NET assembly size emYes I know that it worth thinking of refactoring and splitting a big assembly into several smaller pieces, but it is a 3rd party component, and I cant rebuilt itemp

Negative 2531 pI know the title is an eyebrow raiser but its mostly a side effect problem. Im writing an Android app that I can use with the math Ive been learning in my physics class. Its a 2D bouncing ball app. Im using the time corrected Verlet integrator with an impulse on the floor which is the bottom of the screen. Im adding friction and bounciness so that the ball eventually reaches 0 velocity.p  pThe problem shows up when the ball is resting on the floor and a significant time step change happens. The integrator adjusts the velocities flawlessly and ends up firing the impulse on the floor. The impulse fires when the velocitys abs value is greater than 2.5. Androids GC usually causes a time adjusted 18 velocity.p  pAny help is appreciated. I realize the code structure could be better but Im just trying to visualize and apply physics for fun.

To increase query performance an tree based index might be used. A binary search itself isnt so easy as each entry might have a different size  but the index tree covers that nicely and basically has the same underlying idea.p  pGoing that route first one dimension time, then the other one will result in a poor performance I fear for the ID filtering, as I have to use a brute force lookup.p

Negative 2531 pIm developing a web with CakePHP 1.3.7. Everything is going fine and I love it, but I just came accross a problem probably because of my lack of knowledge that I cant figure out how to fix.p  pThis is my problemp  pIn the website, theres the typical manage my account area, where users can only access when theyre logged in. In this area, theres a link that calls to an action in the same users controller called edititems. So when a user goes to strongedititemsstrong, the action receives as a parameter the users strongidstrong something like domain.comusersedititems45, where 45 is the users id, and shows the information in a form. The problem comes if I go directly to the address bar of the browser and change that 45 for any other users Id, then the information of that other user is also shown, even if that user is not logged in. This is obviously a big security issue.p  pIve been trying to avoid passing the users id as a parameter and getting it from the Auth component which Im using with strongthisAuthUseridstrong. For whatever reason, I can read the logged users info into the form fine, but when I try to save the changes on the form, I get an error as if the strongsavestrong action had failed, and I have no clue why.p  pIs there any other way to avoid my problem Or to figure out why the strongsavestrong is returning an errorp  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSO the problem comes from the validation, heres the deal when the user fills out the form to create a new item, there are certain fields, some of them with validation rules applied. However, when the user goes back to edit the item, not all the fields are editable, only some. Is it possible that, since some fields that required validation when creating the item are not available when editing, that causes the error How can avoid that Can I change the validation rules only for the strongeditstrong actionp  pExample of whats happening when creating an item,one of the fields is strongitemnamestrong, which has some validation applied to it. When editing the item, its name can not be changed, so its not shown in the edit form. I believe this what may be causing the error, maybe because the strongitemnamestrong is missingp

Negative 2531 pI am writing a Silverlight application to process millions of records. Since the load on the server can be quite heavy, I intend to shift some of the processing to the client side. For example, if I needed to show complete information about a book and its author, I would want to JOIN the Book table and the Author table using AuthorID as the common key. Instead of performing the JOIN on the server side, I would retrieve Author table separately and Book table separately and join them on the client side using C code and display them in a DataGrid.p  pThe clients are in a controlled environment so there is a minimum guarantee of their performance. Since there are so many records and since there are no updations taking place in the clientside DataGrids, I would choose Raw SQL over Entity Framework. However, there is the issue of doing the clientside join. My question is, would Entity Framework help make the clientside join easier Consider development time to not be a significant factor here.p

Negative 2531 pI am pulling JSON data from several remote servers concurrently over HTTP, using a WCF service on both the client and server endpoints. Im noticing that for each successive request that starts asynchronously the length of time that http request takes is generally increasing, even if the amount of data is not necessarily increasing. In other words if I start 12 thread pool threads using Funclt.BeginInvoke then each request, after being timed, is showing up in my logs as suchp  precode  HttpRequest invoked.

Elapsed 53567ms   HttpRequest invoked. Elapsed 79081ms codepre  pThe process is pretty simple. I am simply starting each request in a loop and then calling .WaitAll on all of the operations before using the consolidated data. p  pIt looks like the Http requests are taking way longer than they should even with small amounts of data. In fact the difference between small and large amounts of data appears minimal overall. Would this sort of bottleneck be due to concurrent http requests having to share bandwidth, or is there a threading  contextswitching issue possible here Just looking to be pointed in the right direction. p  pbEDITb  Just for clarity, I ran the same process bsynchronouslyb and here are the resultsp  precode  HttpRequest invoked.

Negative 2531 pI have an MVVM application that processes a large number of images in the background, using the .NET 4.0 Task Parrallel Library. The processing is done on a background thread, which posts its progress to a view model property that is bound to a progress dialog. That part is working okay. But the background thread also needs to notify the main thread when all processing is done, so that the progress dialog can be closed.p  pHeres my dilemma With my current code, the processing ending statement gets hit as soon as the background task is set up.

Negative 2531 pIm currently doing work on an optimisation algorithm that requires real numbers Java doubles, to be specific be converted into bit strings again, to be specific an ordered collection of Java booleans and back again. The scheme used is that the first bit indicates whether the value lies in the first or second half of the range the second bit subdivides the halves again, and so on.p  pThe selfmade algorithm Im using to do this works fine when working with ranges that have a specified upper and lower value, however things get problematic when I try to use the full range of the Java codedoublecode I think, although Im not sure, that the problem is related to the fact that codeDouble.MAXVALUE  1.0  Double.MAXVALUE gt Double.MAXVALUEcode. That, however, isnt my question today. Im sure Im not the first one to try to use a number representation like this, so Im sure the answers to my problems are out there on the Interwebs Im just not sure what to search for. What do you call such a representation of real numbersp  hr  p Obviously, the number of bits used places a limit on the precision Im aware of and accept this.p

Negative 2531 pI have a viewflipper which includes a number of layouts.

Negative 2531 pa hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgwindowbuilder relnofollowWindowBuildera for Swing creates checkboxes as local variables and textboxes as member data.  This inconsistency bothered me.  Since it all gets linked up into the toplevel JFrame anyway, these widgets are sure to live as long as the JFrame has references down to them so there doesnt seem to be a need for the textboxes to be member data.  It seems to me that the textboxes should be locals just like the checkboxes.  Locals are better encapsulation. The local references can die at the end of the GUI object a class that extends JFrame constructor generated by WindowBuilder and the JFrame will still have references to all the widgets.p  pMaking them local and putting final in front of these widget declarations so that they can be used inside the event handlers anonymous inner classes was what it took to make them work.  I also had to rearrange the order a bit since the order of instantiation of textboxes doesnt matter if they are all declared as members.  Order does matter for locals so I had to move the uses of the new operator instantiation up a bit towards the top of the local scope.  They just had to be north of the event handlers that use them.p  pSo far Ive found no bugs as a consequence so I am asking why WindowBuilder did not do it this way to begin with.

Negative 2531 pI have two entities, User and UserSetting. The obvious relationship between these two has User as the first rate entity which contains a set  list of UserSettings so when a User is loaded the settings get loaded too. E.g User 1 UserSettingp  pTrouble is thats not what I want. At the moment users only have a few settings but that wont always be the case and when a user is active in the system they typically only need access to a small subset of all their settings. What I want is to load individual user settings on demand. The obvious choice is to make the UserSetting list lazy load but that wont work as I want to use the User in a detached state.p  pMy current solution is to include the User in the UserSetting object but that feels wrong as it makes the relationship UserSetting 1 User which feels like the UserSetting is the dominant entity. Is this the best solutionp  pAssuming my current solution is the best I can get will a delete of the User still cascade correctlyp

The situation then gets compounded, as when LCDS throw the DuplicateHTTPSession error, it also invalidates all known Jsessions attached with the client, meaning that the Tab1  which had been ok  now has a stale JSession.  The next time that Tab1 sends a call, IT causes a DuplicateHTTPSession error, and the cycle repeats.p  pUnfortunately, the Flex framework hooks for delaying calls while sesssions are established have no easy way that Ive found of being reenabled once set.  Ive tried the following, to no availp  precode  Reset DSid to get a new FlexSession established on LCDS    use namespace mxinternal     public function resetFlexSession             FlexClient.getInstance.id  null            Note  using FlexClient.NULLID also doesnt work.     codepre

Adding new medications or conditions is easy enough, but deleting or editing existing medications or conditions seems ridiculously inefficient  Id have to, say, search through the codemedicationscode table for a row matching codepatientidcode with the old codemednamecode, codedosecode, and codereasoncode fields, and then deleteedit it with the new data. I could add some primary key to the codemedicationscode and codeconditionscode tables to make it more efficient to find the row to edit, but that would seem like an arbitrary piece of data.p  pstrongSo what if I just had a single table with the following schemastrongp  ul lipatients id, name, address, meds, conds, ...li ul  pWhere codemedscode and codecondscode are simply representations say, binary of arrays of codeMedicationcode and codeConditioncode objects PHP can interpret this data and fetch and update it in the database as needed.p  pAny thoughts on best practices here would be welcome. Im also considering switching to Ruby on Rails, so if that affects any decisions I should make Im interested to hear that as well. Thanks a lot folks.p

Negative 2531 pIm still pretty new at this so this is probably something very simple and I might fail with vocabulary too, but Ill ask anyway because I just cant figure it out myself.p  pIm making a program that asks for different commands to change certain coordinates and if you give an empty command it simply asks for a new command. The problem is that if you give the program an input file to read the commands from Like this .myprogram lt inputfile  and that file is empty, it ends up in a loop and endlessly asks for a new command. It should be able to exit the program when theres no more input to be read. But how can it make a difference since it cant know if the commands are given from a file or one at a time Or is there a way for it to know After all, if theyre given manually one at a time, one empty command doesnt mean there wont be more coming. I hope this doesnt sound too silly...p

Negative 2531 pI would like to describe my objective and get some feedback of a proposed solution. I am quite new to OpenGL ES or OpenGL at all, so please be gentle. I would also like to mention that the platform is iPad iOS with its belonging restrictions.p  pstrongObjectivestrong To let the user place vertices in which a texture should be drawn properly in the correct perspective or at least adjustable perspective. To explain what I mean, consider the following example.p  pLets say that we have a photograph of a house with a corresponding lawn in front of it. Now, I want to pave a user specified path with tiles texture such that the perspective looks right. If the view is just orthogonal, the tiles will be completely square which is not realistic when having some sort of depth in the image.p  pNow, one approach would be to set up an perspective view with a frustum on OpenGL ES. Then put a plane like below and put the image texture on it for starters.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxvM7L.jpg altPlane to put image texture onp  pNow as you expect from the look of the image above, the image will be distorted. But its fine because if we tilt the plane backwards so that it fit the bounds of the display perfectly the image will appear square. p  pIf the user now defines the area to be paved, we can put those points in the same angle as the tilted plane, and then just put a texture with square tiles in it, and they will appear with a perspective. If our tilt angle is incorrect, the user can adjust it manually, what then happens is that the corner angles of the plane in the above figure will be adjusted and the plane will tilt differently to fit the display. The tiles texture will then appear from a different angle.p  pIs this a workable approach or is there some other, better way to do this I think its an ugly hack that might have to do with my limited skills in 3D programming.p

I think you get the point. Obviously each sub type will have their own respective attributes and members. p  ol lipInstead of creating a name, slug, etc., for each sub post type, what is the best practice to inherit or possibly interface the base class I do favor composition over inheritancepli lipOnce I figure out how to properly abstract out my models, I would like to then figure out some polymorphic way to say something like Blog.find1.posts and get an array of all the posts types.pli ol  pI realize that this may not be performance optimal to query all the post types in a polymorphic way so feel free to seguest a better way.p

Negative 2531 pIve been researching this, but i wanted some input from the community in regards to the MessageBox codeclasscode provided in VB.NET.p  pFrom my point of view and current understanding, i see codeMessageBoxcode as a codeClasscode, mainly because in VS2010 shows it as a class.

Is it simply because this is part of the WINAPIp  pAnother question that arises now that i look at the MessageBox class in VB.NET a bit closer, how come we dont have to create an object of type Messagebox prior to using it. It appears that we can just call the Messagebox class and bring up the Showmethod...p  pIm still in the beginner stages of fully understanding the OOP Concept and i wouldnt mind technical explanations in regards to this particular topic. p  pI was reading over the MSDN page for the MessageBox Function which is what originally triggered me to asked this question.p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms645505vvs.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms645505vvs.85.aspxap  pstrongIn Conclusion, my questionstrong emWhy is MessageBox considered a function in VB.NET when VS2010 intellisense shows it as a Classemp

Negative 2531 pI am trying to understand the new operator more closely. I do understand the fact that it allocated memory from the heap and returns a pointer to the memory.

If I delete ptr, x is still valid as it still exists in the memory. When I say ptr, I am looking for the value pointed to by ptr, which in this case is 4. My question is that 4, where does that reside. Does it live in two separate chunks of memory. One is represented by x and other I just got from new. How does the process happen How does 4 get transmitted across the two chunks, or I am missing sthg Please help.p  pAlso when I say ptr  ampx, is that a bitwise copy. In other words, do I forever loose the memory I just got access to through the heapp

Negative 2531 pI have a Sencha Touch app which works fine in Chrome. However, when packaged as an Android app using eclipse and the Applaud bundle, it develops a rather odd behaviour, which may be related to SoftKeyboardDetect.p  pThe user may tap a checkbox to enter a comment about information displayed. That unhides a text area where they can write their comment. They then tap a button to continue. The information which was displayed is replaced by new information and again they can check a checkbox to enter a comment. Tapping the continue button causes the checkbox to be unchecked and the textarea to be hidden. p  pI find that if the user enters a comment on the first information and then taps the continue button, the continue button remains depressed and has to be tapped a second time in order to continue.p  pI note that hitting the continue button causes the SoftKeyboardDetect event to be fired and wonder if this is what is causing the problemp  pIf I change the code so that, when the user presses continue, the textarea remains displayed I.e. Is not hidden, the problem goes away, which leads me to suppose that the phonegap class LinearLayoutSoftKeyboardDetect, which responds to changes in height, is behind the problem. Does anyone know how I can disable that phonegap behaviourp

The coordinates of the selection made on top of the resized image wont match the ones on the full size image.p  pJcrop includes a solution to a similar issue when handling huge images by using box sizing or the truesize method but none of them work if the width of the image is based on percentages, instead of a given width in pixels.p  pThe only solution I can think of is to resize the image using media queries and make 3 or 4 versions depending on the width of the screen but Id rather stick to the percentage based resize because it looks much better.p  pThis is my jcrop callp  precode      var jcropapi, boundx, boundy     target.Jcrop         onChange updatePreview,         onSelect updatePreview,         aspectRatio 0.75     ,function          Use the API to get the real image size         var bounds  this.getBounds         boundx  bounds[0]         boundy  bounds[1]         trueSize [900,600],          Store the API in the jcropapi variable         jcropapi  this                  function updatePreviewc         if parseIntc.w gt 0             var rx  ltecho widthgt  c.w             var ry  ltecho heightgt  c.h              preview.css                 width Math.roundrx  boundx  px,                 height Math.roundry  boundy  px,                 marginLeft   Math.roundrx  c.x  px,                 marginTop   Math.roundry  c.y  px                                x.valc.x         y.valc.y         w.valc.w         h.valc.h       codepre

Negative 2531 pIm developing a RESTful webservice with a hrefhttpwww.springsource.orgspringdata relnofollowspringdataa as its data access layer, backed by JPAHibernate. It is very common to have relationships between domain entities. For example, imagine an entity codeProductcode which strongemhasemstrong a codeCategorycode entity.p  pNow, when the client codePOSTcodes a codeProductcode representation to a JAXRS method. That method is annotated with codeTransactionalcode to wrap every repository operation in a transaction. Of course, the client only sends the codeidcode of an already existing codeCategorycode, not the whole representation, just a reference the foreign key.p  pIn that method, if I do this p  precodeentity  repository.saveentity codepre  pthe variable codeentitycode now has a codeCategorycode with only the codeidcode field set. This didnt surprise me. I wasnt expecting a save SQL insert to retrieve information on related objects. But I need the whole codeProductcode object and related entities to be able to return to the user.p  pThen I did thisp  precodeentity  repository.saveentity entity  repository.findOneentity.getId codepre  pthat is, retrieve the object after persisting it, strongwithin the same transactionsessionstrong.p  pTo my surprise, the variable codeentitycode didnt change anything. Actually, the database didnt even get a single select query. This is related with Hibernates cache. For some reason, when in the same transaction, a find does not retrieve the whole object graph if that object was previously persisted.p  pWith Hibernate, the solution appears to be to use codesession.refreshentitycode see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7290860hibernatecallinggetaftersaveonthenewlycreatedrecordwithinthesamethisa and a hrefhttpsforum.hibernate.orgviewtopic.phpf1ampt953267 relnofollowthisa.

Negative 2531 pIm developing a peertopeer communications network for use over a LAN in an industrial environment. Some messages are are just asynchronous, and dont require a response. Others are requestresponse. The request messages and the async messages are sent to a multicast group, and the replies to requests are sent unicast.

Negative 2531 pRecently, I read that apps are denied access to the Android keychain if they are executing as root. I have two questions on the matter p  ol lito which extent can an application developer rely on this Root usually has the capability to modify the entire OS. Is this just a hardcoded into the keychains codebase Or moreli liCan anyone point out to me where i can verify this in the keychains codeli ol  pThank youp
Negative 2531 pI actually have more than one question regarding this... Im still new to NSURLCache and UIWebViews but somehow got the basics down I think.p  pAnyway, I was able to successfully implement Caching for my UIWebViewI think. I initialized the NSURLCache. My UIWebView loads its contents with the loadRequest method. I assigned the ViewController that owns the UIWebView as its delegate. I also had the ViewController implement NSURLConnectionDataDelegate. I implemented the connectionwillCacheResponse method just to log a message in the console so I could check that caching was done. I also logged the current disk and memory usage. It increases after the caching so I can see that it did work.p  pHowever, when I load the page again, I think the request is sent again to the server because the connection delegate methods like connectiondidReceiveResponse and connectionwillCacheResponse are being called.p  pI also wanted to try getting the cachedResponse from the cache by using cachedResponseForRequest. I called this method in webViewDidFinishLoad but it always returns null. Did caching really workp  pHow can you tell if the WebView loaded from the cache Am I misusing cachedResponseForRequest And on another note, what proper ControlCache header values should be present in the very least for caching Im testing on googles homepage URL and it returns the private value for its Cache Control header but I can see that caching works because the connectionwillCacheResponse is called.p  pHelp pleasep
Negative 2531 pIm trying to write a function that gets 2 strings and an integer k and returns a common substring of both the strings of length k. If there is more than 1, it returns one at random. There are alot of algorithms online that checks for the LONGEST common substring but I found none that checks the klength substring.p  pI think hash tables is the correct way to do it if I want it to be optimized but I couldnt quite get it.p  pI could only write a function that checks if there is more than 1 klength sequence in list. Here is what I gotp  precodedef repeatst, k     for i in rangelenst  k  1         for j in rangei  1, lenst  k  1             if st[i  i  k]  st[j  j  k]                 return st[i  i  k]     return False codepre  pI would appreciate ANY help with this... p

Negative 2531 pI guess this question is a difficult one. I have two pages with just the same functionality. First one is for People. The second one was created as a copy and then modified a little for Products. p  pI have strongDropDownListsstrong on both pages, both DDLs have strongOnSelectedIndexChangedstrong events and strongAutoPostBack options enabledstrong. Both pages have codebehind procedure strongRefreshPagestrong which reloads the page with strongidstrong parameter. This strongidstrong parameter is the actual selected value in dropdownlist. p  pSo, by design p  p1 I change DDLs selected item, it does AutoPostBack and fires OnSelectedIndexChanged event. p  p2 This event runs strongRefreshPagestrong procedure, which adds currently selected value of the DDL to QueryString and reloads the page with it. p  p3 Then this ID is taken from QueryString and set to DDL. See the code.p  pstrongRefreshPagestrong successfully works on the strongPeople.aspxstrong page. But similar procedure on the strongProducts.aspxstrong never runs at all. I added breakpoints into the same place of both procedures  the line with strongPage.Response.Redirectstrong method. On the first page it stops and shows correct value of the parameter strongparamIDstrong, but the second page never reaches breakpoint. strongOnSelectedIndexChangedstrong event is simply skipped.p  pBoth pages have strongEnableViewState disabledstrong. I dont use javascript or AJAX. I dont use strongPreRenderstrong methods. p  pHere is my code.p  pPeople.aspxp  precodeltaspDropDownList IDddJGroup runatserver OnSelectedIndexChangedRefreshPage AutoPostBackTrue CssClassDropDown FontBoldTruegt codepre  pPeople.aspx.csp  precodeprotected void RefreshPageobject s, EventArgs e      paramID  ddJGroup.SelectedValue     Page.Response.RedirectPeople.aspxid  paramID  codepre  pProducts.aspxp  precodeltaspDropDownList IDddCType runatserver OnSelectedIndexChangedRefreshPage AutoPostBackTrue CssClassclassDropDown FontBoldTruegt codepre  pIn both pages I take the strongidstrong parameter from QueryString and set the selected value of DropDownLists using it in the PageLoad procedure.

But on the strongProducts.aspxstrong the parameter strongparamIDstrong never changes. It should change in the strongRefreshPagestrong procedure, but the procedure never runs and never changes strongQueryString[id]strong parameter. I mean, this page is never reloaded from strongRefreshPagestrong, it just always does simple PostBack.p  pIn the RefreshPage procedurep  precodeprotected void RefreshPageobject o, EventArgs e      paramID  ddCType.SelectedValue     Page.Response.RedirectProducts.aspxid  paramID  codepre  pIf this procedure ran, the page would reload with new strongidstrong parameter and dropdownlist would get this new index.p

Ive been looking at a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarymultiprocessing.htmlsharedctypesobjects relnofollowhttpdocs.python.org2librarymultiprocessing.htmlsharedctypesobjectsa but it only describes how to share variables but I havent figured out how I can share a complete dictionary.

Does returning a value help me get around the fact that I dont want the [] used on the left hand side of the operation  Then again, doesnt the const prevent thispli lipWill the const function be called even on nonconst object  Ive seen a few examples where there are a const version of the operator and a nonconst of the operator declared.  The nonconst allows for writing, whereas the const only allows reading, but is only called for const objects.  My goal here is to have even nonconst objects only have the ability to be read from.pli lipIs there a clean way to pass errors from the operator  My main issue is that the data being requested may be outside the bounds of the data that I have.  All of the examples Ive seen use an assert, but I dont necessarily want the program to crash in the event that the users call to the operator causes some sort of hilarity.  I also cant necessarily pass back a special code since any value of the byte Im passing back may be valid.pli ol  pAs always, thanks for your help as I slowly but surely make the scary transition from being a C programmer to a OO C wizard.p

Negative 2531 pFor me below are the most probable definitions for asynchronous and nonblocking IOp  pstrongcodeAsynchronous IOcodestrong In asynchronous IO applications return immediately and OS will let them know when the bytes are available for processing.p  pstrongcodeNONblocking IOcodestrong Here application returns immediately what ever data available and application should have pooling mechanism to find out when more data is ready.p  pAfter knowing these definitions if we analyze java channels i.e. codeSocketChannelcode, codeServerSocketChannelcode, codeDatagramSocketChannelcode then we can find that these channels can be used as blocking or nonblocking mode by the method codeconfigureBlockingboolean blockcode. and assume that we are using them as nonblocking mode. So here comes the questionsp  pif i will use codeSelectorcode emi.e. register channels to a codeselectorcodeem whether it is strongAsynchronous IO or NONblocking IOstrongp  pI feel this is Asynchronous IO in java if and only if underlying operating system is informing the java application about readiness selection of a channel. Else it is  nonblocking IO and codeselectorcode is just a mechanism which helps us pooling the above mention channels as i mention in the definition. Which is correct Thanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have answered one part of the question i.e. types of IO and how java facilitates these functionality.p  pemstrongBut one question still remains whether all these functionalities are provides by java is simulated at java layer or it uses underlaying OS to facilitate Assume the underlaying OS has all the support for these functionalities.emstrongp  pPlease refer to the answer. p

But that also means that the adress of the function needs to be stored somewhere.p  pTo bind a function to Lua we need it to have the following prototypep  precodeint luaCFunction luaState  codepre  pNo other information is passed, hence this is the entry and information we get when a bound function is called from Lua. p  pIf the binding is done at compile time, we can provide a separate function by templates in the code that will be executed from Lua, giving us comparable performance to handwritten bindings, especially if the compiler optimizes away the boilerplate code.p  pIf the binding is done at runtime, then we cannot create new functions and need a global function that somehow knows what function should it dispatch the call to. Normally, we wouldnt be able to get the information at all, but existing compiletime Lua binders take advantage of Lua custom perfunction userdata or closures to store the additional information needed to perform the execution. However, this has a significant performance hit compared to a handwritten binding, because of possible additional memory allocations and closure dispatching.p  pIve had problems with perfomance of the runtime version in a previous binding implementation although a very stressed one which ended up in rewriting the most stressed parts into handwritten bindings, and, considering that this time I plan to do the lua calls in a realtime rendering loop, I want to find a solution that will be closer to handwritten performance.p  pIf we pass the function as a parameter, we obviously cannot create the function binding at compile time.p

Negative 2531 pI have a table with many entries 4000  5000 with 5 columns. These are paginated and only about 20 rows are shown at a time although all data exists at the client side.p  pI want the user to filter different column by categories and if possible using some wildcards, this user input will be taken using something like Form input. Note that i can perform all the operations using Javascript code, however i am unable to understand what kind of UI elements do i need to use for this purpose I am not from a web dev. background but learning the tricks. I tried using libraries such as selectize, researched some Jquery UI plugins. In fact i also found a spreadsheet specific library slickgrid.js but it is slightly beyond my skill to implement. p  pSo in essence is there a simple way to get user input to select categories in a columns with all data in client array  I would love to reach a stage where i may be able to group column categories and use them to give autocomplete dropdown menus etc. However i am just trying to figure out a reliable way to translate user input to string to be used in code.p

Negative 2531 pFollowing is about nonAMD DOJO below 1.6, but can be applicable to AMD DOJO toop  pWe have a set of customized Widgets that are extended from DOJO provided Widgets. The customized Widgets are used to render multiple UI components.  The customized Widgets are included in the UI using a dojo.cache template. Multiple templates, each corresponding to a different theme of UI, exist in the system.p  pApplication build through maven decides, which theme template to support in the deployed WAR. A dedicated dojo build profile one per each themeenvironment is used to compileoptimize all Widgets in the selected theme into a single JS file.p  pdojo.requirepathtowidget is used to include widgets in the actual code, whereas the associated build profile includes pathtowidget in its list of dependencies.p  pAbove requires developer to include new widget in the build profile in addition to the actual code. A mistake by developer in this regard, is discovered only when the build reaches QA, costing an additional build cycle.p  pTo overcome the costly mistake, we plan to write mavenexecutable JUnit tests that would validate the dojo.requires in the code and the associate build profile. p  pObvious way is to parse the dojo.requires and compare it against the build profile.p  pMy question is  if any better way exists Whether any toolsframework exists to do such comparisonp  pThanksp

I am not sure exactly what the problem is or where it lies, but I will try to do my best to explain whats going on.p  pJust as a little bit of background so that the grammar may make a little more sense, the goal here is to take an input program written in pseudo abcnotation and play it back using the java library, jMusic.p  pAlso, it is worth noting that I am using custom AST code, not ANTLRs built in AST builder.p  pThe problem seems to be occurring first when parsing the fields within the header, but I also tried removing the header from the grammar entirely to try and narrow down where the problem could be arising, but I get similar problems when trying to parse notes so I have a feeling that there is a more general problem going on here.p  pHere is my grammarp  precodegrammar simpleABC   grammar rules  options     backtrack  true   members      override the default error reporting functions     public void reportErrorRecognitionException e           call the Parser member function to report the error         displayRecognitionErrorthis.getTokenNames, e          exit with error         System.exit1        program returns [AST ast]         ast  new Program          header ast.addASTheader.ast         score ast.addASTscore.ast       header returns [Header ast]        header              field ast.addASTfield.ast                field returns [Field ast]        X xNUM                       ast  new ReferenceNumberx.text         T tSTRING                    ast  new Titlet.text         C cSTRING                    ast  new Composerc.text         M bNUM  lNUM           ast  new Meterb.text, l.text         M C                         ast  new Meter4, 4         K kPITCH                     ast  new Keyk.text         L lNUM                       ast  new Lengthl.text         L  lNUM                   ast  new Length  l.text         tempo tempoNUM               ast  new Tempotempo.text        score returns [Score ast]        score              part ast.addASTpart.ast                part returns [Part ast]        instrumentSTRING idVAR  ast  new Partinstrument.text, id.text             phrase ast.addASTphrase.ast                phrase returns [Phrase ast]          b1bar ast.addASTb1.ast                                                    typical bar       b2bar ast.addASTb2.ast  b3bar ast.addASTb3.ast              single repeat         b4bar ast.addASTb4.ast                                                    multiending repeat             1 b5bar ast.addASTb5.ast                                                    1st ending             2 b6bar ast.addASTb6.ast                                                        2nd ending      TODO fix repeats        bar returns [Bar ast]        note ast.addASTnote.ast       note returns [Note ast]        pitchPITCH lengthNUM   ast  new Notepitch.text, length.text         pitchPITCH              ast  new Notepitch.text         lexical analysis stuff     NUM        0..9          VAR        a..zA..Z a..zA..Z0..9          PITCH      A..G  a..g   ,            COMMENT     nr r n channelHIDDEN          WS             t  r  n  channelHIDDEN          STRING       ESCSEQ               fragment ESCSEQ         btnfr          codepre  pHere is a simple input program that I have been usingp  precodeheader      X1     TNotes     MC     KC     L14  score      PIANO pianoPart          C, D, E, F,G, A, B, CD E F GA B c d e f g ab c d ef g a b       codepre  pWhen I run this code, I get the following errorp  precodeException in thread main java.lang.NullPointerException     at simpleABCParser.headersimpleABCParser.java151     at simpleABCParser.programsimpleABCParser.java87     at simpleABCParser.mainsimpleABC.java32 codepre  pOk, so it tells me there is a null pointer exception in the parser.

Negative 2531 pI have a single page application that currently uses ajax and REST for talking to the server.

Negative 2531 pI downloaded Scintilla, built and ran codeScintillaTestcode. That worked almost fine. Now, I want to include Scintilla in a new project, but cant seem to figure out how to. I tried ctrlclicking my target and selecting codeAdd Existing Framework...code, then codeAdd Other...code and finally file located at codescite337scintillacocoaScintillaFrameworkbuildReleaseScintilla.frameworkcode obviously I omitted the first part of the path.p  pAfter I did this I just added an codeimportcode statement in the AppDelegate of my further untouched new project. Upon hitting CmdR it says codeScintillaView.h no such file or directorycode... I thought that if I added the framework to my only target it would pass the location of the header files to the compiler and preprocessor. Obviously it doesnt, so I assume Ill have to add the paths of the header files and maybe other files to the Build Settings, but there are lots of Build Settings, so I dont have a clue where.p  pIf you dont have access to XCode 3.2.x, please leave how youd do it in a newer version. Ive found a lot of information on other XCode matters for higher versions did that work well in XCode 3.2.5 too with a little bit of searching for menu items and settings panels.p

Negative 2531 pHow to segregate thisp  pSay there is a module built with a contract i.e. implements an interface. This is done so for unit test purposes and extensibility.p  pSay there is a person A in my team skilled at writing unit test cases for the data access module. So his code simply instantiates this interface after loading the appropriate interfaces and assemblies. And that person write test cases using the interface as the core test subject. Not sure if this is proper word usage.p  pAnother person B, who is the actual developer of the module, and who is a bit novice with writing code and doesnt have a huge knowledge of the .net framework. Even he also writes some test cases. She writes code for the module as per the specification guidelines put forth by a team lead as mentioned above.p  pSo As test cases would be more in line with system goals. But Bs test cases are more like exploring the .net framework. For e.g. it may be something like exploring File.Replace. Unless you read the docs about it very well you are likely to think two files lying anywhere in the filesystem can be replaced. However, the docs say otherwise. But say, B, doesnt know about it. He writes test cases to learn about that.p  pSo generalizing on the whole thing, there are two groups of unit test cases. To be able to track effort and performance, and possibly come out with a training plan for B, Ill need both test cases. However, while testing the data access module on the whole, Id only need to execute As test cases. p  pDoes Visual Studio enable me to do this Selectively run test cases. How can I quickly run all of As test cases onlyp

I feel like this is wrong, and Im missing something.  Is there another way Is it even possible to create a common interface for two different number base calculatorsp
Negative 2531 pI display a list, each item includes an array of ids that reference other documents mongodb. When the user clicks on an item I want to populate the array with the actual documents  replacing the ids with the corresponding object.p  pMy problem is that the data is not applied to the correct place in the array once the requests finish. Probably the index that I hand over in the callback function is increased as the for loop marches on. By the time the request is ready, the for loop likely already finished so the result gets attached to the end of the array instead of its original position. I tried deep copying the index with angular.copy although I believe that should not be necessary. I am not even sure if int is an object or a flat datatype, a small Google research yielded no clear answer to that.p  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coeditgnqWsfnRauGJrRaY4w0Wppreview relnofollowI was able to recreate the problem in a plunkr.ap  pI encountered a similar problem before but was able to work around it but this time I am not sure how to deal with this problem.

Negative 2531 pSo Ive got an interesting problem that took me quite a while to figure out. I have a main website page that has a signup button on it.  When this signup button is clicked, an ajax request is made to load the signup form.  Embedded in the sign up for is this codep  precodeltfbloginbutton showfacesfalse dataautologoutlinktrue permsbasicinfo sizemedium width200 maxrows1gtltfbloginbuttongt codepre  pSo I am just trying to load a login button.  Nothing out of the ordinary.p  pBut the login button will only load if I call fb.init AND the code that asynchronously loads the FB SDK within the signup form.  If I try to do these operations when the main page is loaded and thus before the login button exists, then once the login button markup is loaded, it does not display.  What is the common idiom for resolving this issue  It is not practical for me to only load the FB SDK from the signup form since it will be used for other things on the main page.  Also, I would prefer to not load the signup form from the start since it is unlikely a user ever clicks the sign up button.p  pThank youp
Negative 2531 pIve been doing some research on this and havent been able to come up with anything so far and maybe thats my answer, but I thought Id reach out on here to see if anyone might know anything about this.p  pIm using Sass for my stylesheets in a project and I was wondering if there is a way to compile everything twice once with all mixins present and a second time without a certain mixin. In this case, the mixin Im curious to omit is one that Ive written to deal with media queries at certain breakpoints, which I utilize at various points throughout my stylesheet to keep all relevant styles bundled together rather than in a separate responsive stylesheet. However, Id like to test certain things by removing all responsive styling at times, hence the desire to remove these for one set and keep them in another and be able to switch back and forth as needed.p  pFor example, I might have some styling for a page title like sop  precode.hpage    fontsize 24px   include breakpointtablet      fontsize 21px      include breakpointphone      fontsize 18px     codepre  pWhich would output the followingp  precode.hpage    fontsize 24px   media maxwidth 979px      .hpage        fontsize 21px           media maxwidth 480px      .hpage        fontsize 18px          codepre  pBut Id like to be able to compile everything a second time in a separate stylesheet to just yieldp  precode.hpage    fontsize 24px  codepre  pAny guidance on this is greatly appreciated. As stated above, I havent been able to find anything on this in my research, so Stack Overflow is my last resort to see if anyone out there can provide a little insight on this.p

Negative 2531 pTo gain better understanding of how promises work in Javascript I decided to give it a try and code basic implementation myself. p  pBasically I want to implement Promises Object I call it Aaa in my code that takes function as an argument.

Negative 2531 pIm using LiveValdiation to validate my form and it works great. One problem Im having is that I have a View as PDF link which saves the form and pops up the PDF in another window. The reason why I save first before viewing the PDF is that users often dont click the Save button before previewing their PDF. They will fill out the form and click on View as PDF right away assuming that they can see the PDF with the fields they filled out.p  pIf the form has fields that are required but werent filled out, the save call fails. I want to know whether there is a way to trigger the LiveValidation form validation when the View as PDF is clicked and will only proceed with the PDF part if validation passes.p  pI thought triggering a simple form submit would do the trick but the problem is that even though it validates, since it submits the form, the form reloads and doesnt get to execute the PDF call code. This is why I need a LiveValidation form validation which does all the live validation on the form but doesnt submit the form. Does anyone know how to do thisp

I was able to determine that System.Drawing was loaded through the use of the following codep  precodeDim currentDomain As AppDomain  AppDomain.CurrentDomain Dim assems As [Assembly]  currentDomain.GetAssemblies Dim assem As [Assembly] For Each assem In  assems     MessageBox.Showassem.ToString Next assem codepre  pFrustratingly the loaded assembly corresponds exactly to the one referenced in the error same version, public key, etc.p  pIf am am able to get a handle on the assembly as a System.Reflection.Assembly is there anyway to use methods from that assembly directly to load the assembly into the System.Drawing namespace Would System.Drawing show up as as in the current domain if it wasnt referencedp  pstrongEDIT FOR CLARITYstrongp  pI see System.Drawing is loaded in the application based on what I was able see loaded up in AppDomain. But I can access it. Can I reload it with the assembly reference into System.Drawingp

Negative 2531 pWhat is the best way to go about storing numbers in memory within MATLAB but then writing only a specific subset of them to a matrixarray during a forloop I am also struggling to setup an appropriate forloop for my problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyPAAn.png althttpi.stack.imgur.comyPAAn.pngp  pI have a line of a specific length x100, and a barrier at specific position pos50.

Negative 2531 pThis is more of a theoretical question on how to structure a user accounting balance architecture. For the stack we are probably going to use Symfony with Doctrine, but I dont think that the language is most relevant. p  pThe problemp  pWe need to create and maintain a usage balance for each user for our rest API to be used for billings.p  pThere are three types of billingsp  ol liFixed price, such as yearlymonthlyli liPost pay usage based per API call.li liPre pay usage based per API call.li ol  pAnd a mix of these on the same account. API calls can have different prices.p  pThe problem is not as simple as having a SQL table with a column that says balance and update this. We need to log the deposits and withdrawals on the account and track every API call and usage for auditing. So this means we probably need a transactions table.p  pSo this is where I need advice. For large scale applications, should we put every single users transaction in the same table, then use SQL to summarize the balance per date This table could become enormous after a short while. 1 million API calls  1 million rows.p  pWe could probably utilize some kind of debitcredit solution. So that when an invoice is paid the order system will add a positive balance to this account. And when an API call is made it debits depending on the price.p  pSince we have 3 different billing models we may use some kind of tag that says that API call 1 2 3 are fixed price and API call 4 5 6 are paid per usage.p  pIf it is on post pay the balance will go negative.p  pOn each billing run the order system will ask the balance system how much to invoice.p  pAny thoughts on how to structure this in a sane wayp

Negative 2531 pIm completely new to Qt mobile, I even dont have a solid mobile dev experience, so sorry if Im asking something obvious.p  pI need to develop a mobile app that should have the ability to receive a call like functionality over internet, not GSM call. When answered, it should start streaming audio and video from our server. The call should be one way only, meaning, that stream goes from server to device, but never from device to server.p  pSo my questions isp  ol liIs this possible in Qt I chose Qt because I familiar with it and I want to support desktop, android and ios. maybe windows phone later.li liIs it possible to receive a call when the screen is shut off and my app is not running I mean, this is a mobile device, the app wont be running all the time, it should be started only when a call is made from server to device. How can I achieve that I think Viber, Skype and other messaging apps do that.li ol  pMany thanks in advance p

Negative 2531 pI try to use the gibbs sampling to produce samples from some bayesian network models, like mildew.net and alarm.net, alarm is perfect, but when I try to use it for midew.net network, it is like something wrong, the computed marginal probability ist not close to the true marginal with the increasing of the sample size as expected So I think maybe is the problem that this gibbs chain for mildew network has not a unique stationary distribution, how to solve the problem like this How can I contruct the gibbs chain that has the unique stationary distrition Or there is some other mcmc based alorithm that can avoid this problem Thanks in advancep  pIn addition, is there any clevere methods that can check whether the chain has one or more stationary distributionp

Negative 2531 pAccording to the GreenfeldRoy book Two scoops of Django, putting the secret key into an environment variable instead of the settings file is a good practice. So I followed this advice, but that lead to problems when trying to execute a selfwritten management command in a cronjob. p  pAfter a bit I figured out that I had to include the secret key environment variable into the crontab file itself, otherwise manage.py was unable to load external modules this is due to the fact that cron doesnt know of anything but a small subset of environment variables. So after the fix, my crontab file looks like thisp  precodeDJANGOSETTINGSMODULEmyproject.settings DJANGOSECRETKEYmyprojectsecretkey  0 0    pathtopython pathtomanage.py managementcommand codepre  pId like to know if its a good solution or if is there any other maybe more pythonic way of addressing this issue.p

Negative 2531 pHow does the size of a realmfile develop p  pTo start with I have a realmfile with several properties and one of them being an array of 860 entries and each arrayentry consists of a couple of properties again.

Why does the realmfile double at a critical value and not linearly increase in size with more content added p  pThanks for a clarification on this.p

Negative 2531 pI am working on AEM6, but this problem is also applicable to previous version of the platform. I have noticed that default workflows DAM Update Asset and DAM Parse Word Documents are started by launchers codeetcworkflowlauncherconfigupdateassetcreatecode and codeetcworkflowlauncherconfigparseworddocxcreatecode. These workflows are always started in the same order codeparse word docxcode is started after codeupdate asset createcode. I wanted to implement similar functionality, so I created my own workflow with one process and then created launcher very similar to docx parser launcher.p  pThe problem is that my launcher starts before default DAM Update Asset workflow. Is there any way to set an order of the launchersp

Both things work as expected, but what I do not understand is that every time I signal the work item, it also automatically completes the work item, which leads to the problem that the process continuous with its regular path AND the signaled one.

Negative 2531 pWhat design pattern do you suggest for the following case p  pA class is needed to represent the serial string of some documents which consists of numeric characters. There are 4 types of serials and the first character of the string specifies the type of serial. Each type of the serial has some numeric fields that are separated by the pipe character. Serial types differ only in the number of fields that they have which is fixed for each type. The meaning of each field is irrelevant and can have arbitrary values. A serial string ends with a pipe character that is followed by a twodigit checksum of all preceding numeric values of the serial. For example, the following string represents a type 2 serial numberp  p2020256660002031p  pHere, the first digit, 2, specifies that the serial is a type2 serial. The serial string has 3 fields and the checksum of the serial is the last two digits, 31, which is simply the sum of all preceding numbers. p  pIn this case, it is fairly easy to solve the problem without using any particular pattern but Id like to know what famous patterns can be utilized to solve this problem or similar ones for example, parsing MICR data of banknotes. p

Negative 2531 pI have a process where users can upload a file and have it processes. My windows forms application takes the number rows and processes them but I want the progress bar to follow along with the number of rows that are processed. p  pFor example.br Say someone uses a file with 51 rows.  So what I do is divided 100 by the 51 and I get 1.96078431372549.  Now the progress bar only takes in integers so a double wont work.  If I round up when I get to the 51 row the progress bar will error out because the number will be above 100.p  pWhat would be the best way to handle this situation  Especially since the users files can have from 50 to 100,000 rows.p  pThank youp

Im currently using tomcat  jersey  postgresql server side to implement a RESTlike layer, and it would be good for the proposed solution to work with these technologies, but if I you believe the best solution lies with other java techs it can be discussed.p  pIve been looking at websockets, and some of the chat samples out there, starting with the tomcat websockets chat, but they are stateful and not well suited as they are to scale.p  pThe way I see it, with a websockets approach I could take state out of each node, by storing it in the database, but then Id need some sort of pubsub mechanism for all nodes to push new messages to the clients they are bound to that participate in a chat room. p  pSince I dont want to reinvent the wheel, I was hoping to be able to put in place a solution by composing existing and tried technologies.

Negative 2531 pBasically, Im writing a small databaseinventory system for a game. The item class and its subclasses weapon, armor, consumable, etc are all finally up and working. My vector for inventory is written within a separate inventory class allows more than one inventory  i.e. enemies can have them too and at this point, the inventory is FAR from written  there is still no drop function, etc.p  pbut im taking this one step at a time because its a learning experience.p  pbasically I believe in this case, pointers are the answer. this code seems to work have not tried it yetp  precodeWeapon DebugDagger 1, Debug Dagger, Debug Dagger given to you by Help, 25  Armor DataCloak 2, Data Cloak, Data Cloak given to you by Help, 10  Item pItem  ampDebugDagger Weapon pWeapon  ampDebugDagger InventoryManager PlayerInv PlayerInv.pickupItempWeapon codepre  pin this case, codepickupItemItemcode is taking a static Item type  which is the base class for my function, where the weapon being added to the inventory is a subclass codeclass Weapon  public Itemcodep  pthe way this is written seems to hack together a solution, but it would be MUCH easier if I could just write the pointer into the class functions themselves so that EACH item created in a subclass automatically will create a pointer of itself to the base class so I can add it into the inventory subsystem. Is there a way to do this from Within the class so that EACH member gets a pointer created automatically upon class creation When I try to use the name variable in the constructor to do this, it does not work, as it seems I have to create the member BEFORE making a pointer, so I dont see how to do it at the same time anticipating a new member being created.p  pI mean, Im all for other more effective ideas than a stdvector inventory for an inventory  I think some function that actually can simply accept the members of any class and record them would be FAR more effective in the long run, but I do not believe this is possible  I think that creating pointers to Item from the subclasses  would still be necessary  seeing as, really, its all items, with each sub function having a single extra specifier ONLY being used for its own function, weapon has attack, consumable has restoration, etc and its ALL integers, so really those are the same as each other almost, but for function reasons, like equipping, using, classifying, they each get a separate type I suppose I couldve made a SpecialItem subclass to cover it all, but that would be very ambiguous, and leave little room for innovation should a specific type need modification later.p  pI just dont see it if there is an alternative. if there is direct me and I will read voraciously until I find understanding of it.p

Negative 2531 pI always got the following error, when trying to connect ffmpeg with ffserverp  pBut lets start with the theory I want to Broadcast a stream, which is already existing in the internet to able to do some analytic stuff on the stream. So my idea is as follows i have one ubuntuserver currently ubuntudesktop version 12.x on a virtual machine, i will change it to a real server later.... and i want to run on the server ffmpeg, which should record the livestream and saves it locally ffserver, for broadcasting the same livestream, using the rtp protocoll because of the timestampheader in the protocoll. so if i understoot the documentation correctly, this is my idea   start ffserver from linuxterminal   codeffserver f Desktopffserver.confcode   start ffmpeg and connect to the feed of ffserver  codeffmpeg re i httpInternetStreamer.sdpplaylist.m3u8 vcodec libx264 s 320x240 pixfmt yuv420p vb 200000 minrate 200000 maxrate 200000 bufsize 2000000 acodec libmp3lame ab 128k ar 44100 f rtp an httplocalhost8090feed1.ffmcode  I am getting the Stream from the URL a hrefhttpInternetStreamer.sdpplaylist.m3u8 relnofollowhttpInternetStreamer.sdpplaylist.m3u8a and want  sent it to ffserveralso i want to save it locally for backup later...p  pnow when i start ffmpeg i get the following error  Could not write header for output file 0 incorrect codec parametersp  pLast thing to say is that is very important to broadcast the stream with RTPProtocoll.

Negative 2531 pI need to start using JIRA for estimation and came across a scenario I have not found a good solution for yet.  Consider an installation with more than one project which is already populated with many existing issues.  Many of these issues are linked to other issues not necessarily in the same project.p  pHow can we configure a special link say parent of and fields to record both effort estimate and logged work so that when any of the children are updated, some special field in the parent gets updated to reflect the corresponding aggregated valuesp  pJust to be clear here, two issues A and B may be linked in more than one way e.g. parent of, duplicate of, relates to, depends on, etc.  However, aggregation of the special fields should only happen for a specific type of link.  You can see the point when you think of the duplicate of link which clearly should not be aggregated.p

For example, if I load Product Page A at 930, and Product Page B at 932, theyll both be stuck on those respective times. Both pages are being rendered from the same code.p  pIve never worked with Liquid before, but I assume it should retrieve fresh data from the server with each page load, similar to PHP. Am I mistaken about thatp  pEDIT 2 It gets even weirder. Sometimes I have a query string appended to the end of the URL of a given product page e.g. codecomicID225code. But if I change the number in the query string or even just type in random garbage instead it will retrieve a new stuck date. So it appears any unique URL gets a unique stuck date from whenever it first gets loadedp

Negative 2531 pas much as a try to build data warehouses and databases, Excel is still ubiquitious in the office  my office in particular has decided to try to move all shared documents into SharePoint instead of a network server.p  pAnyway, SharePoint is incompatible with Excels drop down menu aka data validation. At least, thats the case in online viewer mode, which Sharepoint defaults to.p  pYeah a bit of a nuissance, but Im wondering if there are any alternatives in designing a way to store data.p  pCurrently, I have a list of metrics, say 20, and a list of monthyears .... so the data is already 2 dimensional on the spreadsheet. I would put client and a few other things as data validation dropdowns, to add additional dimensions.p  pAny ideas on a solution to keep the data displayed accurately, but still in Excelp  pI mean the other classic RDMS pattern would be to store all dimensions in column format  aka client, monthyear, region, metric 1, metric 2, metric 3  but this is poor for telling a visual story. Hmmm ... I dont know, any thoughtsp  pAnother usecase is scorecards for individual people. This previously worked well with a data validation dropdown of a list of employee. The metrics would be populated based on a vlookup sumifs pointing towards this box.p  pNow this also works with 30 worksheets, but then you have to maintain 30 sheets of formulas, whenever something is added or removed, manage an array of sheets instead of an employee list.p  pI dont know  data validation is useful, and it not working in sharepoints online viewer is strange  just wondering about a work around.p

Negative 2531 pI just started refactoring my nonframework project into using Slim and Twig to try and make it follow a more modern design pattern.p  pIve come to the conclusion already, that for each route I have on my site, I will have to have a corresponding require with a matching path  or a require that has all possible paths in one I dont know if theres a noticeable difference there aside from the logical separation of code.p  pIt does not make sense in my head to include possibly in my case 80100 routes and try and match them for strongevery single requeststrong when the request could determine where we wanted to go in the first place  assuming we went away from the singlepointofentry philosophy that Slim and so many other frameworks build upon. Is this how its supposed to work or is there something I have misunderstood  I have read numerous tutorials on many different frameworks in attempt to find the right one for my project which in itself was and still is a nightmare, and none of them seem to touch on the subject of Hey  why are we doing this so inefficientlyp  pIs the includerequire operation simply so fast that we should not care, and we just sacrifice this for manageability Excuse my ignorance, but when coming from a project where I only type requireinclude when I actually need something, this seems, well, stupid. I should mention that that development style has turned my project into chaos, which is why Ive ended up here with Slim in the first place.p  pI just want to understand if Im doing it right.p

Negative 2531 pIve been using AsyncTasks for a while however, Ive recently encountered a scenario where Im unsure of how to handle correctly. Since I thought it would be a somewhat common scenario I decided to ask the question here.p  pSo, Im trying to use an AsyncTask to make a simple call to sign a user in to the app. After the call completes, if it succeeds, the user should be taken to another activity. This logic is simple. The problem arrises when the user navigates away from the app before the sign in call returns. In such a case, what should I do in codeonPostExecutecodep  pWhat Ive seen some apps do is they continue with the call anyways, as long as the activity is still around, and will launch the next activity. However this creates a weird experience where the user navigates away from the app, then several seconds later, the app just pops back up in their face. Of course, I would like to avoid doing this.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Example codep  precodepublic class ExampleActivity extends Activity      private boolean mIsPaused     ...

The working time of a day is 0800  1800, 10 hours.ol  ol2. The workers are hourlypaid say 30hour, but some time must be wasted in traffic from the endworked house to starttowork house. The farther between the two houses, the more time wasted.ol  ol3. Initially, the workers are placed at their 1st serving house.ol  pI have thought of the problem for some days, but I can not think out a traditional algorithm best suited this problem. It may be relate to big data processing algorithms, but I am not sure. Could someone have good thought of this problembr Thanksp

I think this is due to my variable bcodeimagenescodeb in which I save the route of my images R.raw.imagen and R.raw.imagen2 on codeMainActivity.javacode only charge the image once at the start of the application, so even if I change the variable later in my function codeonClickcode the texture remains the same. brp  pWhat I tried to do is making a switch in the class codeTextureCube.javacode looking my variable bcodeimagenescodeb in the function where I load the texture so it should charge the first image at the start of the application and then if I press the button change it to the other image because of the code codeonClickcode.brp  pThe image never change because I printed the variable bcodeimagenescodeb. I dont know what I am doing wrong.p  pMainActivitybrp  precode b.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener             Override            public void onClickView v                 if getimagenes  R.raw.imagen                     imagenes  R.raw.imagen2                    b.setTextimage2                 else if getimagenes  R.raw.imagen2                     imagenes  R.raw.imagen                    b.setTextimage1                                     codepre  pTextureCubebrp  precode  Construct an input stream to texture image                 switch main.imagenes                      case R.raw.imagen                       is  context.getResources.openRawResourceR.raw.imagen                         break                     case R.raw.imagen2                       is  context.getResources.openRawResourceR.raw.imagen2                         break                  codepre  pI left the rest of the code of the application here.Here is my code of the MainActivitybrp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity      private GLSurfaceView glView     private TextureCube cube     int imagenes  R.raw.imagen     Button b     Bitmap bitmap      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain          GLSurfaceView         glView  new MyGLSurfaceViewthis         cube  new TextureCube         setContentViewglView         createButtons           public void createButtons          ButtonB         LinearLayout ll  new LinearLayoutthis         b  new Buttonthis         b.setTextChange Texture         ll.addViewb         ll.setGravityGravity.BOTTOM  Gravity.CENTER         this.addContentViewll, new LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, LayoutParams.FILLPARENT         b.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener             Override            public void onClickView v                 if getimagenes  R.raw.imagen                     imagenes  R.raw.imagen2                    b.setTextimage2                 else if getimagenes  R.raw.imagen2                     imagenes  R.raw.imagen                    b.setTextimage1                                               Override     public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu          super.onCreateOptionsMenumenu         getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.menumain, menu         return true           Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item           Handle action bar item clicks here.
