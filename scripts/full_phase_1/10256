Positive 10256 pIm new to C and trying to write a command line program with it. Im trying to free a char array right before the program terminates. But Im getting a debug assertion failed runtime error when it reaches the codefreecode command. Before it reaches that point, the program is removing characters in that array up until the first whitespace. Im using the incrementing technique on the array since I read that was a way to remove chars one by one from an array.

Negative 10256 pI converted my program from Delphi 4 to Delphi 2009 a year ago, mainly to make the jump to Unicode, but also to gain the benefits of all those years of Delphi improvements.p  pMy code, of course, is therefore all legacy code. It uses short strings that have now conveniently all become long Unicode strings, and Ive changed all the old ANSI functions to the new equivalent.p  pBut with Delphi 2009, they introduced the TStringBuilder class, presumably modelled after the StringBuilder class of .NET.p  pMy program does a lot of string handling and manipulation, and can load hundreds of megabytes of large strings into memory at once to work with.p  pI dont know a lot about Delphis implementation of TStringBuilder, but I heard that some of its operations are faster than using the default string operations.p  pMy question is whether or not it is worthwhile for me to go through the effort and convert my standard strings to use the TStringBuilder class. What would I gain and lose from doing thatp  phr p  pThank you for your answers and leading me to my conclusion, which is not to bother unless .NET compatibility is required. p  pOn his blog on a hrefhttpwww.deltics.co.nzblogp349Delphi 2009 String Performance, Jolyon Smith statesap  blockquote   pBut it looks to me as if TStringBuilder is there primarily as a .NET compatibility fixture, rather than to provide any real benefit to developers of Win32 applications, with the possible exception of developers wishing or needing to singlesource a Win32.NET codebase where string handling performance isnt a concern.p blockquote

Do you have examplesp  pConsider the following scenariobr A few lines of Ant create a Jar from my sources that includes everything found on the classpath. Then jarjar is used to remove all .class files that are not necessary to execute, say, class Foo. The problem is that all the data files that class Bar depends upon are still there in the Jar. The ideal deployment script, however, would recognize that the data files on which only class Bar depends can be removed while data files on which class Foo depends must be retained.p  pAny hintsp

I have the country selector on pretty much every page of importance on the site as it is used to allow people to search.p  pThe issue that I am having is that the widget is screwing up my Google Keyword density. Because the autocomplete field contains every country, and it appears on all pages, Google believes my sites major keywords include Island 1, with Saint 3, Republic 4 and South 5 following closely behind.p  pI think part of the problem can be fixed by placing the appearance of the country autocomplete lower in my html, but I would prefer that those words not make it into Googles scans at all.p  pSo, my question is this Is there a way to hide part of a pages content from Google It needs to be kosher with Google as I dont want them to think I am trying to trick them and get sinbinned.p  pCheers,p  pJames.p

Negative 10256 pI have created a couple of controls that inherit from UserControl for my Winform application. They both have parameterless constructors, as is required.  When I drop them onto my main form, I get an error in Visual Studio at designtime where it cannot render the form.p  pWhat I discovered is that, in the forms Designer.cs file, where my control is instantiated, the IDE is placing a line there that calls one of my setters.  codeBlockKey  0code.  Well, the code behind the setter is calling some other code, and quickly a NullReferenceException gets thrown because the forms not running that other code is not prepared to produce anything at that point.  p  pIf I manually remove the setter line, the error goes away.

Negative 10256 pIm not entirely new to Java programming, but have begun applet development in my CS course. Essentially, I am creating a basic chat client whereby users are greeted with an authentication upon running of the applet. Once they enter a correct string into a TextField, the Client class gets called, which creates the basic Client GUI and places it on the AWT GUI.p  pHowever, herein lies my problem. I am doing this all in the init method before handing over program control to the clientserver upon creation of the Client, which makes sense to me. However, my authentication system is GUI based as well, so, upon creation of the Client, I overwrite the authentication GUI with the Clients GUI.p  pAnd this is where it all dies My Client GUI doesnt show up on the applet, and no amount of remove or hide or show makes it show up.p  pIm probably missing something incredibly elementary here, but I really dont know whats wrong here, so any help would we really appreciated p  pHeres code for my init function. Dont worry too much about processMessage and the auth boolean  for now processMessage simply returns true if the input entered in the input TextField is valid, and auth stores that.p  precodeprotected TextField input  new TextField protected TextArea output  new TextAreaPlease enter your username and password n private boolean auth  false private Client c  public void init     host  localhostgetParameter host    port  Integer.parseInt7866   Sets authentication layout   setLayoutnew BorderLayout   addSouth, input   addCenter, output   output.setEditablefalse      input.addActionListenernew ActionListener       public void actionPerformed ActionEvent e            auth  processMessagee.getActionCommand      if auth  true                 setLayout new BorderLayout          c  new Clienthost,port         add Center, c                 codepre  pAlso, please note that if I move my auth  true block to the body of init outside the event listener and force auth to true, so it basically skips over authentication, my Client GUI loads.p

Negative 10256 pI have an installer made using wix. During installation it takes input from user to be used in setting up an IIS website. Now the problem was that during uninstall it was corrupting the IIS default website and my assumption was that this is because during uninstall it is not having that user input.  So to solve this I am storing the user input in registry and then reading it and using it to setup the site during installation. So during installation it creates the registry keyvalue, then read it and use it to create site. Assuming that during uninstall it does th reverse i.e reads it and then remove it, the problem should have been resolved. Unfortunately this is not the case. Any pointers  p

Negative 10256 pWe had a ten developers who do commits in the dev branch. After a week once all the tasks are through, i need to merge all the commits to test branch for rebasing before i tag and merge the releases to trunk. While merging a range of revisions i am getting strucked and time consuming to resolve with svn conflicts. When i get conflict  I used to do the following p  ol lipI  allways consider the latet revision file for eg .r500 is the latest revision which i need, and removing the extension it generate like filename.java.rev500, and deleting the remaining like mine,base file and previsous revision files which it genrates when the conflicts occur. Is this a best practise and advisable.I allways use diff in the log and check the latest version file manually while considering a revision when i get the conflict.pli lipWhile merging most of the conflicted, updated files i am getting these symbols, strongltltltltltltlt .workingstrong and strong .mergeright.r500.strong Do we need to manually remove this in the files, when we perform releases. Even some times these symbols effect my build, resolving after i manually remove them.pli lipIs it advisable to merge 15 to 20 revisions at a time, for eg consisting 70 files in the entire release, is it better to merge 4 to 5 revisions solve the conflicts and move forward with remaning revisions, but if i merge few revisions and again after with remaining revisions its conumes a lot of time. When ever i do merge, i should allways manually edit, or any best methods and practises i need to follow.pli ol

Negative 10256 pOk, so Im a little new to DevExpress and Im jumping into the middle of an existing project that makes heavy use of the DevExpress grid bound to a codeLinqDataSourcecode and leverages the grids builtin filtering. Heres a quick overview of what Im looking atp  ul liThe grid is bound to a collection of EF4 entities called Review.li liI have extended the Review entity via a partial class that contains a property called IsCurrent. IsCurrent contains some logic that returns a boolean value.li liThe initial datasource for the Grid contains ALL reviews that the current user could potentially see.li liWe have leveraged DevExpresss built in ability to save grid layouts. Using the Filter Builder, we can filter on native properties of the Review entity i.e. properties that exist in the generated entity model. So if Name is a member of the Review entity, filtering on code[Name]Testcode works just fine.li ul  pWhat I REALLY want to do is filter also based on the property I created in the partial class IsCurrent. However, when I modify the filter string that gets saved in our database and add code[IsCurrent]truecode to the filter string, I get a completely empty result set. I tried switching it to false and it is still empty.p  pIs is possible to filter on a property that is a member of the partial class and not the generated entity model If not, is there an accepted workaroundp  pHeres some sample code that illustrates some of the important parts albeit extremely simplifiedp  precode    protected void LinqServerModeDataSource1OnSelectingobject sender,  LinqServerModeDataSourceSelectEventArgs e                      e.QueryableSource  GetAllRecords      codepre  pstrongReview.cs partialstrongp  precodepublic partial class Review      public bool IsCurrent             if something            return true        else            return false          codepre  pstrongDevExpress filter stringstrongp  pfilter[IsCurrent]  truep  pIf I change the filter to filter[NameTest], it works just fine and shows me all of the records with a name of test. Reverting to [IsCurrent]true just shows an empty set. I know for sure that result set contains valid data that should be displayed.p  pAny ideas It seems like its not working if I try to filter on values created in the partial class, but works for values obtained from the generated entity model.p

Negative 10256 pIve had a colleague that told me he once worked for a company that had as a policy to never have conditionals if and switch statements in the code and that they let all the decisions in the code be done using polymorphism and Im guessing some other OO principles.p  pI emsort ofem understand the reasoning behind this, of having code that is more DRY and easier to update, but Im looking for a more indepth explanation of this concept. Or maybe its part of a more general design approach.p  pIf anyone has any resources for this or would be willing to explain or even have some more terms related to this I can use to find more answers Id be much obliged.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions234458dopolymorphismorconditionalspromotebetterdesignone question on SOa that was kind of related but Im unfamiliar with C so I dont understand too much of the answers there.p  pIm no OO guru btw but I can managep  pIm most proficient in PHP, and after that Python so Id prefer info that uses those languages.p  pUpdate Ill ask my colleague for more info on what he meant exactly.p
Negative 10256 pI have a WinForms application that I have taken over support for and it was build using Visual Studio 2005 with VB.Net. The application makes use of an Access database. It runs fine when it is installed as a standalone application, but the install cd for the application also allows for a network install and this is where I am currently encountering issues. p  pTo test the network install I created a folder on my server Windows Server 2003 SP2 and copied the Access database to this folder. I created a share for this folder and gave everyone full permissions to the share. Then on the workstation I installed the application and gave the path to the database as followsp  pmyservermysharemydb.mdbp  pThe install steps here are as per the instructions given on the installation cdp  pThe workstation that I installed it on is Windows 7 Ultimate. When I run the application, I get the error message given in the title when the application tries to read the database file. I have confirmed that I am able to write to the shared folder on the server, so I dont think this is a permissions issue. Also, the database file is not in use at all, so it is definitely not opened exclusively. Anyone have any idea what could be causing this and what I could try do to get it workingp  pUPDATEp  pI have tested the workstation installation on a computer with a fresh install of Windows XP SP3 and it is able to access the database file without a problem. So it seems that this error that I am getting is somehow specific to Windows 7. Is there maybe a known issue with Oledb drivers on Windows 7 My version of Windows 7, btw is 32 bit.p

Negative 10256 pAm writing a multithreading application that has several threadsapproxiamately 25 with each thread performing a specific process and then updating the database in the which then gives the next thread the permission to process another process and do the same.

Negative 10256 pIm really hoping someone can help me on this as I am completely stumped and have been unable to locate a response that fixes my issue. I am setting up a custom ListView, adding a button to it, and the buttons event simply will not fire. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pSome background This is a project costing application. Each project has a number which varies of activities and a number which varies of roles. Any activity can be worked on by one or more roles. As a result, I build the listview dynamically, because I dont know ahead of time how many roles there will be. To do this, I run one query which sets up the SELECT statement in my SqlDataSource so that it returns the right number of columns. Then I build the ListView that will be bound to it. So I pass in an array of strings to the ItemTemplate so it knows which columns to make. Hope that makes sense. Also, Im inserting this into the middle of a hardcoded table, so it renders as a series of  lines, without the  tags because theyre in the ASPX file in static code. Ive tried setting the CommandName of the button to edit, select and a custom function name, and simply cannot get the corresponding events to fire.

Negative 10256 pSay I have a webapp running on some number of loadbalanced EC2 servers, storing and retrieving metadata from SimpleDB with larger chunks of data stored on S3 due to the whole 1 KB limitation of SimpleDB. Since S3 is pretty high latency and I dont want to be making a ton of requests over there anyway, Ill want a caching layer for the info... enter ElastiCache.p  pOk so I provision an ElastiCache server with endpoint X so I hardcode X into my app on EC2 and its running happily until I get a few hundred thousand new users and all of a sudden my cache server is woefully underpowered for the demand. Fortunately I can just start up a few new larger cache servers... but then I realize Ive got endpoints X, Y, and Z and my app only knows to try X, so I still have a problem.p  pSo right now Im just trying to get my head wrapped around the various pieces to this puzzle, and I havent gotten to the coding part yet, but wont this be an issue Ive read the documentation for ElastiCache and it mentions that it is a cache cluster, but then each server in the cluster seems to have its own endpoint. Is there a way for an app running on EC2 to know about all the cache servers that are running, and more to the point which one contains the data for a particular key Is it possible to ask the cluster as a whole to store or retrieve a piece of informationp

Negative 10256 pIn a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7784825fileleveltrackingingitfilesfrommultiplebranchesinsamedirectoryprevious questiona I asked if anyone had already written a script to allow mixing files from multiple branches or even repos in the same directory so that they would all get committedpulledetc.. from their appropriate origins.p  pPlease see that post for reasons why this isnt a case where splitting into separate repos or branch arrangement would work before objecting.p  pThe answer to that question seems to be that no such script exists.  My question now is what is the best way to go about writing the script.p  p1 The easy way.  Wrap a simple perl script that checks multiple branches behind the scenes and keeps a record of which file belongs to which branch and simply copies the files back and executes the git commands behind the scenes.p  p2 If possible I dunno some kind of fancy usage of low level git commands to do this directly without having any checkouts.  Is this possiblep  p3 Some kind of low level interface into the git code.p  pThe obvious problem with 2 is wasting resources with all the hidden checkouts and the ugliness of the whole thing but I dont know enough about 2 or 3 to know if they are reasonably possible.p  pp  pI guess my primary question is whether there are low level git commands to check files into a branch without ever creating a checkout and to check them out into random directories.  If so I could just use these commands to directly work with the files in my multibranch directory and avoid secret checkouts entierly.p

Negative 10256 pI am going through interfaces as defined in the complete reference. I just wanted to understand what the following paragraph mentions about.p  blockquote   pInterfaces are designed to support dynamic method resolution at run time.   Normally, in order for a method to be called from one class to another, both classes   need to be present at compile time so the Java compiler can check to ensure that the   method signatures are compatible. This requirement by itself makes for a static and   nonextensible classing environment. Inevitably in a system like this, functionality gets   pushed up higher and higher in the class hierarchy so that the mechanisms will be   available to more and more subclasses. Interfaces are designed to avoid this problem.   They disconnect the definition of a method or set of methods from the inheritance   hierarchy. Since interfaces are in a different hierarchy from classes, it is possible for   classes that are unrelated in terms of the class hierarchy to implementp blockquote  pSo, what did the author mean by, Normally, in order for a method to be called from one class to another . Please drop in your views.p

Negative 10256 pMy situation is that Im currently storing a hierarchy in a SQL database thats quickly approaching 15000 nodes  5000 edges . This hierarchy is defining my security model based off a users position in the tree, granting access to items below. So when a user requests a list of all secured items, Im using CTE to recurse it in the db  and flatten all items , which is started to show its age  slow .p  pThe hierarchy is not changing often so Ive attempted to move it into RAM  redis . Keeping in mind i have many subsystems that need this for security calls, and UIs to build the tree for CRUD operations.p  pb First Attempt b br p  pMy first attempt is to store the relationships as a key value pair this is how its stored in the database p  pre        E              F     G             H  I  J    K  mapped to     E  [F, G]     F  [H, I]     G  [J, K] pre  pSo when i want E and all its decedents, i recursively get its child and their child using the keys, and it allows me to start at any node to move down. This solution gave a good speed increase but with 15,000 nodes, it was approximately 5000 cache hits to rebuild my tree in code  Worse case scenario... starting at E. performance is based off the starting nodes location, resulting in super users seeing the worst performance. This was still pretty fast but seemed to chatty. I like the fact that i can remove a node at anytime by popping it out of the keys List without rebuilding my entire cache. This was also lighting fast to build a tree on demand visually on a UI.p  pb Second Attempt b br p  pMy other Idea is to to take the Hierarchy from the Database, build the tree and store that in RAM  redis  then pull the entire thing out of memory  it was approx 2 MB in size, serialized  . This gave me a single call  not as chatty  into redis to pull the entire tree out, locate the users parent node, and descend to get all child items. These calls are frequent and passing down 2 MB at the network layer seemed large. This also means i cannot easily addremove and item without pulling down the tree and editing and pushing it all back. Also on demand trees building via HTTP meant each request had to pull down 2MB to only get direct children  very small using the first solution .p  hr  pSo which solution do you think is a better approach  long term as it continues to grow . Both are defiantly faster and take some load off the database. Or is their a better way to accomplish this that i have not thought aboutp  pThanksp

Ive tried messing around with Tempfile.new as well, but that didnt seem to help much, and I was either getting 401 or 403 errors. Im fairly new to Ruby, so being as explicit as possible about changes needed would be really helpful. p  pI should note that Id like to avoid putting the file on the filesystem if possible. Im really just passing along the upload here, and I never need access in my scenario to the file ondisk afterward. Keeping the files inmemory is much preferred. p

But since my project is run through NUnit, I have little control on its entry point.p  pAccording to NUnit documentation, it should call some constructors first, then a method marked with the code[SetUp]code attribute in a class marked with code[TestFixtureSetup]code.p  pSo, First, I created a static helper class which I can call several times without trouble. p  precode  public static class LoggingFacility        private static bool loggerIsUp  false      public static void InitLogger            if loggerIsUp  false         XmlConfigurator.ConfigureAndWatchf        loggerIsUp  true         codepre  pThen, I made all my code[TestFixtureSetup]code inherit a single one that does pretty much nothing else than calling codeLoggingFacility.initLoggercode. But that still leaves all constructors that are run earlier, in an order I can only assume random. And moreover, it will probably do some static initializations before I am even able to execute some code.p  pIn fact, as I can see in my log, the first 4 seconds or so of execution are completely unrecorded.p  pDoes it mean I will have to call my codeInitLoggercode in every constructor and forbid the use of any static initializer Thats tough jobp  pDoes somebody know a magic trick with thisp
Negative 10256 pIm trying to implement DI in a class, but Im not sure that my design is appropriate.p  pThe relevent code in the class I want to add DI top  precodeclass DoerValidation      public DoerValidation            compileData         private void compileData            doersActive  Doer.GetActiveDoers        ...      codepre  pAnd in my codeDoercode classp  precodepublic partial class Doer     private static readonly DoerRepository repository  new DoerRepository     public static IEnumerableltDoergt GetActiveDoers            return repository.Doers.Wherec gt c.Person.IsActive      codepre  pI just dont get how I could implement DI in this situation. Maybe the codeGetActiveDoerscode method is bad design Where would you put this method otherwisep  pWould it be a good practice to start adding new methods directly in the repository Some people told me it should stay clean so it implements only thisp  precodepublic interface IDoerRepository      IQueryableltDoergt Doers  get      void SaveDoerDoer doer     void DeleteDoerDoer doer  codepre
Negative 10256 pIm using JITs JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit Spacetree. Example a hrefhttpthejit.orgstaticv20JitExamplesSpacetreeexample1.html relnofollowhttpthejit.orgstaticv20JitExamplesSpacetreeexample1.htmlap  pIts trivial to change the orientation of the whole entire tree to top, right, bottom or leftp  precodest.switchPositionleft, animate, fnComplete codepre  p.. but Id like to do this over specific subtrees of the main tree. So far I have been unable to figure this out. Basically Im using the Spacetree to display a site map and Id like to have the whole site visible by default without being cut off. Ive set the options so that the whole tree is visible constrained false, levelsToShow 3, but the tree itself is too large for the window. I realize that it might be impossible to avoid this completely but changing the orientation on specific subtrees probably based on the depth would optimize the space that the tree occupies and put more or all of its contents in visible view.p  pIn case it isnt obvious enough by the description, the size of the trees canvas is the windows size.p  pThanks in advance I look forward to hearing any replies.p
Negative 10256 pI playing with facebook api a bit, and theres aomething that is a bit of a problem, im using Multiquerying, to get all pages a user liked.  so i make one call to get all pages a user liked, and than a nother call to get the names of the pages. I end up with 2 lists, one is pageids and one pagenamesp  precodequeries.addSELECT uid,pageid,createdtime FROM pagefan WHEREuiduserId,pagelikes queries.addSELECT name,pageurl FROM page WHERE pageid IN SELECT pageid FROM pagelikes,pagedata codepre  pIs there a way that instead of displaying 2 lists, ill get one list with that shows page name under his page id something like this  123214211 coca, 123213pepsip  pthat would so much useful than just 2 lists, that you need to connect between them. Lets say i need to get comments of photos, so ill have one query for photos, second query for comments. But how will i know which comments fits to what photop  pThanks aheadp
Negative 10256 pI have a VS2010 project which is a windows application that acquires data from a particular bluetooth device. All I want to do is alter my acquisition thread to send the data it acquires using OSC. p  pI spent a long time trying to use a library called LIBLO but it appears to function using POSIX style asynchronicity. I spent even more time trying to make pthreadswin32 work for me so that I could still use this library but still had no luck.p  pI switched to trying to use the OSCPACK library which I could not get to compile using the batch file included in the release. I was eventually able to get my VS2010 project to recognise the library but all I get now are linker errors LNK2019 and LNK2001. The relevant directories are listed in Additional Include Directories in the project properties. I know this should be something easy to fix but after a day of frustration I am at my wits end. I am used to working with xcode in osx so find it difficult to accomplish anything in VS2010. Do I need to give additional instructions to the linkerp  pcan anyone either suggest a simple, prebuilt OSC library compatible with windowsVS or how I can fix my problem with unresolved externalsp

Negative 10256 pTlDR Im having a surprisingly slow rendering time, using the below code  Any idea why that might be or suggestions on how to improve the performance would be deeply appreciated.p  pIm developing an application that needs to support multiple rendering backends e.g. codeSVGcode and codeCanvascode, but Im having some demiserious performance problems that I didnt expect when rendering to Canvas.p  pRight, so my code is built up, so that each backend implements a Canvaslike drawing API, so that the rendering syntax remains the same no matter what backend is being used. My code is rendering Glyphs which are defined as SVG paths originally from a SVG font file. The problem is that the canvas rendering is surprisingly slow  Almost as slow as the SVG which has ema lotem of DOM interaction. p  pI would like to have a rendering time that allowed to have an animation framerate of at least 30 FPS, but right now, a singly frame takes about 5070ms Chrome with Canvas, and 8090ms with SVG which at the best would result in 20 FPS. Im right now rendering 30 Glyphs with an average count of 24.5 drawing commands.p  pMy question is Is there a more efficient way to do this sort of rendering or any way to achieve better performance, because Im stunned by the inefficiency of this method even though I cache the glyphs. A codeGlyphcode is an object which on initialization decodes the SVG path string into a what I would think faster notation, which makes the path an array of arrays.

Negative 10256 h1Bottom Line Up Fronth1  pIs there a succinct way that I can constrain the number of child entities that can belong to a parent in Entity Framework.  I am using 4.3.1 at the moment.p  h1The Problemh1  pI am developing an ASP.NET MVC3 site which accesses data via a data access layer that uses Entity Framework.  I have a SearchList entity which has a many to many relationship to a Search entity.  A SearchList may have many Searches, and a Search may belong to many SearchLists.p  pAt one point in the workflow of the site, a user needs to select the searches and other items to use in a batch search.  We want the page to load the entire search list.p  pSearchLists can get quite large, and as a test we created one with 21,000 searches.  It took a few seconds, and the data returned was about 9.5 MB, which we were expecting, but jQueryUI choked when trying to tableify that much.p  h1What we would likeh1  pSo we want to impose a limit on the number of searches any search list can have.  I can go through the application and put a bunch of rules in that checks the size of the collection and if the searches that are trying to be added plus the size of the current... yada yada yada.p  pIf however there was a better way especially one that could easily output an error message that MVC would pick up I would totally take that instead.p  pI have googled, and perused a number of EF blogs to no avail.  Constrain children and max number of children in collection and similar searches have returned results that are about Linq queries and the Count and Max methods.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 10256 pIm curious Is there a best practise on how to hash an arbitrary string into a RGB color value Or to be more general to 3 bytes.p  pYoure asking When will I ever need this It doesnt matter to me, but imagine those tube graphs on any GitHub a hrefhttpsgithub.comCocoaPodsSpecsnetworknetwork pagea. There you can see something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comw0pFx.png altgit branchesp  pwhere every colored line means a distinct git branch. The low tech approach to color these branches would be a CLUT color lookup table. The more sophisticated version would bep  precodebranchColor  hashStringToColorconcatusername,branchname codepre  pBecause you want a static color every time you see the branches representation. And for bonus points How do you ensure an even color distribution of that hash functionp  pSo the answer to my question boils down to the implementation of codehashStringToColorcode.p

Negative 10256 pI have a typical link on a page. On hover, the link receives a border color and borderradius. In Safari 6, I am noticing that when the mouse leaves the link there is a very faint border color left behind. If you hover again over the link, the border gets darker and darker in some cases, even though the bordercolor is not set. If borderradius is not set, the issue does not occur.p  pI cannot repeat the issue in Firefox or Chrome for Mac. The simplest fix I found was to specify a solid or transparent border color for the base anchor style. Could this just be a Safari rendering bugp  pLink for the rendering issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzafermsnak4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netzafermsnak4ap

When clicking the ok button, the NpgsqlAdaptor is supposed to update the changes to the database.p  pWhen adding a record and pressing OK, the database is correctly updated and shows the new record.  However, a duplicate new record is added to the Datagrid.  This seems to be caused by a binding issue, but Im not sure why.p  pWhen modifying a row then pressing OK, I get this exceptionp  precodeA first chance exception of type

Negative 10256 pI recently read Paul McKenneys 2010 white paper, a hrefhttpwww.liblfds.orgmediawikiimagesaa7Michael2CScottSimple2CFast2CandPracticalNonBlockingandBlockingConcurrentQueueAlgorithms.pdfMemory Barriers a Hardware View for Software Hackersa.p  pI would very much appreciate some feedback  comments  guidance with regard to a small sections of C code, given below, which implement the MampS queue enqueue function, in particular with regard to memory and compiler barriers.p  pThis code is using pointercounter pairs to handle a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiABAproblemABAa and for the sake of this post should be considered as written for and only for x86x64.p  pThe inline comments are all written now, for this post, and are part of this post in that they express what I currently think I think.p  pFor brevity, Ive stripped the code of asserts and cache line padding in the structs, etc.p  pCurrently, I think the code is quite broken, but I want to make sure I think so for the right reasons.p  hr  precodedefine PACSIZE 2  struct lfdsqueueelement    struct lfdsqueueelement     volatile next[PACSIZE]    void     userdata   struct lfdsqueuestate    struct lfdsqueueelement     volatile enqueue[PACSIZE]    struct lfdsqueueelement     volatile

locallqe[PACSIZE], enqueue[PACSIZE], next[PACSIZE]   unsigned char casresult  0   unsigned int backoffiteration  1     TRD  here we have been passed a new element to place            into the queue we initialize it and its next            pointercounter pair       locallqe[POINTER]  lqe   locallqe[COUNTER]  struct lfdsqueueelement  lfdsabstractionatomicincrement amplqsgtabacounter     locallqe[POINTER]gtnext[POINTER]  NULL   locallqe[POINTER]gtnext[COUNTER]  struct lfdsqueueelement  lfdsabstractionatomicincrement amplqsgtabacounter      TRD  now, I think there is a issue here, in that these values            are by no means yet necessarily visible to other cores             however, they only need to be visible once            the element has entered the queue, and for that            to happen, the contigious doubleword CAS must            have occurred  and on x86x64, this carries            with it an mfence             however, that mfence will only act to empty our            local store buffer  it will not cause other cores            to flush their invalidation queues, so surely            it can all still go horribly wrong             ah, but if all other cores are only accessing            these variables using atomic operations, they            too will be issuing mfences and so at that            point flushing their invalidate queues       do        enqueue[COUNTER]  lqsgtenqueue[COUNTER]     enqueue[POINTER]  lqsgtenqueue[POINTER]      next[COUNTER]  enqueue[POINTER]gtnext[COUNTER]     next[POINTER]  enqueue[POINTER]gtnext[POINTER]       TRD  now, this is interesting               we load the enqueue pointer and its next pointer              we then immediately below check to see theyre unchanged               but this check is totally bogus  we could be reading              old values from our cache, where our invalidate queue              has not been processed, so the initial read contains              old data and we then go ahead and check from our cache              the same old values a second time               whats worse is that I think we could also read the correct              values for enqueue but an incorrect old value for its              next pointer...               so, in either case, we easily mistakenly pass the if              and then enter into code which does things to the queue               now, in both cases, the CAS will mfence, which will              cause us to see from the data structure the true              values, but how much will that help us  we need              to look to see what is actually being done               the if checks next[POINTER] is NULL               if we have read a NULL for next, then we think              the enqueue pointer is correcly placed its not              lagging behind so we dont need to help we then              try to add our element to the end of the queue               now, it may be we have read enqueue properly but              next improperly and so we now try to add our element              where it will in fact truncate the queue               the CAS however will mfence and so at this point              we will actually see the correct value for enqueuenext,              and this will prevent that occurring               if we look now at the else clause, here we have seen              that enqueuegtnext is not NULL, so the enqueue pointer              is out of place and we need to help, which we do by              moving it down the queue               here though we could have read enqueue correctly              but next incorrectly the CAS will mfence, which will              update the cache, but since were only comparing              the enqueue pointer with our copy of the enqueue              pointer, the fact our next pointer is wrong wont              change  so here, we move the enqueue pointer to              some old element  which although it might be in the              queue so this would be an inefficiency, youd have              to do a bunch more queue walking to get the enqueue              pointer to the final element it might not be, too              it could in the meantime have been dequeued and              that of course would be death           if lqsgtenqueue[POINTER]  enqueue[POINTER] and lqsgtenqueue[COUNTER]  enqueue[COUNTER]             if next[POINTER]  NULL

Negative 10256 pThis is embarrassing to admit, but I just continue to struggle with setting up my Python environment on an Ubuntu install. p  pSometimes I get it to work fine. But heres the problemp  pI feel like whenever I sit down to do some hobby hacking on a python project, I end up spending hours on end just trouble shooting inconsistencies with my python installation. Right now I keep getting an error message of   p  precodeImportError cannot import name urandom  codepre  pwhen trying to import a module called googleplaces httpsgithub.comslimkrazypythongoogleplaces.p  pBut its always something that causes me to go on an endless snipe hunt for the proper configuration of this that or the other. p  pI just want to work on the project, not plumb around endlessly in forums. p  pWhich brings me to my point How do I completely nuke my existing python setup including virtualenv, pip, easyinstall, etc. etc. and just start from a completely clean slate I have already tried reinstalling everything python from synaptic, but no success, still getting error.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Ive reinstalled virtualenv and that seems ok so far. Found that my import error is a permissions problem, if I import in the interactive using sudo, it passes fine. How should I be correcting my permissions so I dont have to run sudo  Probably close this and start a new question.p
Negative 10256 pI understand why SignalR doesnt give you a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7854663signalrdoesntusesessiononserveraccess to the HttpContexta. However, this is quite problematic for us. Let me explainp  pOur application is a MultiTenant application where the user chooses the environment while logging in. This basically registers the ConnectionStringName in the HttpSession. In our SignalR Hub, we need to access the database on codeDisconnectcode. But this is not possible because we have no HttpContext at this point and cannot determine the environment to write to.p  pCan anyone provide us with a suggestion how to solve this problem Were a bit stuck on this one.p  pstrongEDITstrong Bonus point if your solution works in a LoadBalanced environment.p
Negative 10256 pIn short, I need to be able to traverse Z3ast tree and access the data associated with its nodes. Cannot seem to find any documentationexamples on how to do that. Any pointers would be helpful.p  pAt length, I need to parse smt2lib type formulae into Z3, make some variable to constant substitutions and then reproduce the formula in a data structure which is compatible with another unrelated SMT sovler mistral to be specific, I dont think details about mistral are important to this question but funnily enough it does not have a command line interface where I can feed it text formulae. It just has a C API. I have figured that to generate the formula in mistrals format, I would need to traverse the Z3ast tree and reconstruct the formula in the desired format. I cannot seem to find any documentationexamples that demonstrate how to do this. Any pointers would be helpful.p

Negative 10256 pWe have a distributed system with lots and lots of services running.  We currently ship a common log4net config file with each instance of an application.  To modify logging on site for a range of applications the support and implementation staff find it tedious and error prone to have to modify config files all of which look exactly the same.p  pIm wondering if it is possible to merge log4net configuration files together similar to the way .NET manages its environment.config, machine.config, app.config amp web.config basically by starting at the Top of the tree and looking for and merging configurations at run time from the lower levels.p  pIf it were possible we could then have a single location where we could add in a new  appender and then modify each applications config file to enable just that appender.p  pI cant find anything in the log4net configuration examples that would enable this.p  pHas anyone any idea if this is possible or maybe an alternative approach which could be used to achieve the same effect.p

Im setting the initial value using the followingp  precodesessionid  sessionid codepre  pEach time a user adds an item to their cart, I run a query to count the number of products in their cart and save that value using the followingp  precodeSESSION[totalcartproducts]  carttotalproducts[totalcartproducts] codepre  pOn the web site, the cart page is generated each time it is loaded by querying the cart table by passing the sessionid file and pulling the results.

Because the cart page will still work even thought the total cart products session has expired and displaying 0 in the header.p  pI would think both sessions would end at the same time, but they are not.

At some point I renamed the branch, say to featuresMyFeature, so that the branches would be better organized I now have many more branches than before. However, it seems that now on BitBucket, there are two branches  MyFeature, and featuresMyFeature. Is there a way to remove the old branch from BitBucket, so that there is only one branch, featuresMyFeature What is the best way to rename branches so that the branch names remain consistent across different checkouts of the GIT repositoryp

Negative 10256 pI am working on what will be a freemium radio streaming app.  Essentially, the app will be free to download, and for no purchase, you can stream a max of 1 hour of live content per day, and have access to a limited archive selection to stream or download.  What I would like to do is set up inapp subscriptions so the user can pay by month or year, with option to autorenew. Doing this would remove time restriction and grant access to a larger archive selection. After the initial time of subscription has passed, and hasnt auto renewed, it would go back to its limited use.  I have never done subscriptions before, and want to make sure this is something that can be done, and that abides by Apples inapp purchasing rules. p

Negative 10256 pI have a set of items that are due for people in a system and some items are in a checklist and others are just used for display. I want to get a list of items for display, and a list of items in order for a checklist report showing items still not completed. I was hoping to get some insight on performance and options for ordering items. I could a add a field order as a positive integer and order them by that order number, or b create a chain object where one item has a next link to the next item in the chain so I can iterate through rapidly.p  pI guess the second option would require more overhead from the database since it would require a SQL call each time calling item.next, right The benefit of making a chain would be in resorting the items when I need to make an ordering change.p  pAny thoughts on performance, and maintainability for which direction I should go This is a general case question, would it generally be better to use SQL to get the ordering or create a data structure like a chain to iteratep

Negative 10256 pI am working on a project that needs to decode the h264 video using dxva2.0.

That is to say, I create an interface of IDirectXVideoDecoder, then I call the dxva api BeginFrame, Execute and EndFrame. Then the problem comes out. when I execute my program on a Intel Core i5 CPUthe GPU is the Intel HD graphics inside the CPU, everything is OK. But when I execute it on a intel ATOM processorwith the intel GMA3000 series graphics hardware, I cant get the right result some video frames are decoded correctly, whereas others are totally in mess. The data I use is sent from another computer, and the data can be directly filled to the buffers of dxva. In h264, the buffers are DXVA2PictureParameter, DXVA2Bitstream, DXVA2InverseQuantization and DXVA2SliceControl. So it is not necessary to use the ffmpeg or ffdshowand the ffdshow is gpl, I cant use it. The dxva checker software tells me the guid of intel core i5 is ModeH264VLDNoFGTClearVideo and that of intel atom is ModeH264VLDNoFGT. I want to know the differences between the two guids. Could it be possible to use ModeH264VLDNoFGT on a intel video card to decode a videop

Negative 10256 pIm doing some work with websockets and need to address security. From what I have read it is apparent that SSL is the best approach in my circumstances so WSS is the way to go this isnt the question, just statement of fact.p  pThe server may stream a large amount of data to clients. The data isnt private or sensitive so I am not worried about anyone sniffing the data. My main concern is that the WS connection is validated as receiving commands at the server could be harmful and destructive. The client must be trusted.p  pThe server will be an embedded device with limited processing power. So my view is that the data can be transmitted in the clear via WS.p  pSo my approach is for the client to wss to connect to the server, authenticate and request a session key. The client then will disconnect from the wss connection and then connect via ws to the server, passing the session key received from the previous wss connection. The server will only accept a ws connection if the connection immediately passes a valid session key with an appropriate expiry time on the session key. One connection attempt only via ws will be allowed per client, with a reset on a successful wss connection.p  pSo my question is if this approach is reasonable or if my approach will have some serious vulnerabilities. I am restricted to ws and wss, Im using node.js with websocketnode at the server and pure javascript at the client.p

Negative 10256 pMe and some friends are making a top down shooter in Java and wanted to make it online we have set up a UDP socket connection which works fine but we arent to sure about how to store data that we receive from the client.p  pat the moment we are using a number of hashmaps to store the data, for example we have three hashmaps for player tracking, game information number of players etc and bullets bullet locations, who fired etc.p  pBut I am sure that there must be a better more secure way of storing this data other than hashmaps but not to sure what.p  pemeditem thx Philipp Sorry it took so long for a half decent questionp  pMy concern about using hashmaps to store this data is that there are quite a lot of data to be put into them and we are currently using a single row to store all data for a object for example a row in the player hashmap would have the player id as the key, with a string value to store anything else such as hp,xloc,yloc. which we then split to use. Which I cant seem to think is the most efficient way to store and retrieve the data.p  pSorry if this still doesnt make sense.p  pI suppose my real question is are there any alternatives that are more efficient or if the hashmap is the best way to gop  pThanksp

Negative 10256 pI am using StringTemplate to generate HTML and I would like to be able to combine codeSTGroupFilecode and codeSTGroupDircode such that I have a directory of group files.  This way I can include multiple templates in one file but also combine templates from multiple files.  It doesnt appear that there is support for this but I thought I would see if maybe Im overlooking something.p  pIn case you are wondering why I would want to do this, lets look at an example from the StringTemplate docsp  precodetestname  namebracket  apply bracket template to each name bracketx  [x]             surround parameter with square brackets codepre  pAssume the above is all in one file test.st and we are using codeSTGroupDircode, it will be unable to resolve the bracketx template unless it is in a separate file bracket.st.  In this particular instance, bracket is like a local helper which is useful for cleaning up the main template.  In this case, you probably dont want bracket to be visible outside of test.st.p  pHowever, if you wanted to create a library of simple helper templates, you might want to locate them all in one file and have each of them accessible to templates in other files.  p

Is there any way I can do this without having to create all the markers on the client side, and saving references to them There may be many markers more than 10K, perhaps up to 100K so Im not sure how well this will work on the clientside which is why I prefer fusion table layers.p

Negative 10256 pMy Rails app runs primarily on a regular mySQL database, however, if this database goes down I would like the Rails app to failover to a MongoDB database which is basically just a cached version of the primary database.p  pSome ideas I had were two models AR and MongoDB  using Mongoid and then catching exceptions in the controllers and using the MongoDB models if the primary fails, but I feel like that would be too cluttered having two models of everything. Another idea was and I havent tested rescuing database connection exceptions in the model and using the model as a MongoDB one instead but thinking about it, if the model originally inherits from ActiveRecordBase there might be issues.p  pWhat would be a good approach to tackle thisp

Negative 10256 pIm trying to use the Geocoding service in the Google Maps API to get the latitude and longitude values for an address, and then pass the result to PHP to connect to a database and find locations within a certain distance from the found address. It will then pass the results back to javascript to display the results on a google map.p  pEverything is working, however I cant seem to pass the variable from the javascript to php. I understand this is because php is server side and javascript is client side however Ive seen a couple of forums that explain how it can be done, but not on the same file.p  pSo is there a way to pass javascript variables to php in the same filep  pMany thanks.p

Shop TZ is known.p  pProblem is that I use couple of jquery plugins datetimepicker and calendar that utilize browser local time internally, and there are a few thousand lines of code to analyze and fix, making it less supportable  browser in Bruxellesany other TZ for each new Date will get local browser time.

Negative 10256 pso Im working on my Tumblr Theme right now. Im using Masonry to have all my posts in a 5column grid and the infinite scroll script to load new images into the grid when Im scrolling down.

Im already using window.load instead of document.ready but the pictures keep overlapping nonetheless.

Negative 10256 phallo im working with the Stellaris chip LM3S9B96 and im using the usbstickupdate. I modified it to update the internal flash of Stellaris and to update a SPI Flash over SSI. But now i want to make a firmwareupdate for the bootloader itself. And i think this could be happen if i directly update the bootloader in thr ROM. Is it possible and what is the idea to do this. Normally i would put a file named BOOTUPDA.BIN in the usb stick and the bootloader would see that a firmwareupgrade for the bootloader itself is required so the bin file for the bootloader would be loader into the ROM and the new bootloader would be programmed.  Anyone any idea how this is possible. normally you dont need to upgrade the bootloader, but it is possible that there are some changes in the bootloader to upgrade it.  Thanksp

Negative 10256 pI have two web applications, of different technologies, one is developed in ColdFusion and the other in Asp.Net.p  pBoth applications have authentication implemented. The usernames for both applications are the same where as the passwords differ.p  pSo here is what I wanted to do, I log in to my ColdFusion application and when I click on a particular button it has to navigate to the Asp.Net application, without asking me to log in again to that application.p  pThis is the solution I came up with I passed the username from the ColdFusion application on button click as a querystring parameter to Asp.Net url, where it checks if it has keyed querystring and if username exists then log in to the Asp.Net application.p  pIt looks something like this codehttpxxxxxx.comusernamexxxcode But passing username in the querystring is not secure, what can be done to make it secure Im thinking of encrypting the querystring, can this be done Or should I follow another method to get this log in functionalityp

Negative 10256 pusing C and Windows Formsp  pI wish to allow my user to select rows for exporting from a dataGridView however, I also wish to allow them to sort and filter by columns.  Is there a best practice for doing this  The reason I ask is that it seems to be that you can do one or the other, but not both without intercepting the mouse click and then setting up a method to change the SelectionMode from RowHeaderSelect to ColumnHeaderSelect.

I did search for information, but all is outdated or not relevant for my needs.

Negative 10256 pI want to make a slider in Java, similar to JSlider, but it can have muliple sliders within itself. To be precise, I want to implement the slider used in Fixed Width Functionality in Microsoft ExcelFrom Data Fixed Width.  A normal slider has just one point, which we can drag to various positions. Now if i click within a position at a slider, a new point should get added, and the dragging operation of this point should be independent of the previous ones. Also if I do a double click, the point is removed from the slider.p

Negative 10256 pI have a method that takes an upper limit, and returns a list of primes numbers up to that limit.p  precode    public static Listltintgt AllPrimesUnderint upperLimit codepre  pI later decided that I really just needed to do lookups on the list, often just asking the question Is This Prime. Since I was dealing with all primes under values like a million, I realized that HashSet was the structure I should be using. Certainly the lookup using the result of the method was faster, but the method its self was emslowerem.p  pI believe the reason its slower is because HashSet checks for duplicates before adding, while a List just shoves it on the end. What surprised me, and what spawned the question and title, is why starting with a List and using it to create HashSet, like so p  precode    hashSet  new HashSetltintgtPrime.AllPrimesUnder1000000 codepre  pis faster than using a Hashset internal to the method, enabling a call like thisp  precode    hashSet  Prime.AllPrimesUnderHash1000000 codepre  pIf the slowdown is in the duplicate checking, it should have to do the same amount of checking no matter what, right This is likely where my understanding is failing me.p  pHere are the times Im getting for primes under one million.p  ul li0.1136s Pure Hashli li0.0975s Pure List emexpected to be fasteremli li0.0998s Pure List Converted to Hash emnot expectedemli ul  pIf the reason for this can be explained in simple terms, Id love to hear it.

Negative 10256 pI regularly interact with massive OLAP based Pivot Tables. Usually these are more or less undocumented. And thus they are difficult to really wrap my head around and use effectively.p  pOne of my strategies for learning what data is being presented is to mouseover a field in the pivot table field list and then pressing the down arrow to see a emdistinctem list of the values within the option. See image below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjIDZZ.png altYou cant see my mouse, but its clicking op  pI thought Woah, maybe I can write some VBA to do this for me and I can generate a list of unique values in the cube so I can quickly scansearch for what I am looking for.p  pNow, Im reasonably adept at VBA, but I just cant seem to get it. I am guessing that the method that I need doesnt exist. However, I thought Id try here.p  pFirst attemptp  precodeSub listcubefields Set objNewSheet  Worksheets.Add objNewSheet.Activate intRow  1 For Each objCubeFld In WorksheetsSheet1.PivotTables1.CubeFields     objNewSheet.CellsintRow, 1.Value  objCubeFld.Name     intRow  intRow  1 Next objCubeFld End Sub codepre  pThis generates a list of all of the available pivot table fields which can actually be sort of useful, but there doesnt seem to be a way to get the childrenleafsdescendants of a codeCubefieldcodep  pNext I triedp  precodeSub testfieldlist Worksheetssheet4.Activate With Worksheetssheet1.PivotTables1     c  1     For i  1 To .PivotFields.Count         r  1         Cellsr, c  .PivotFieldsi.Name         r  r  1         For X  1 To .PivotFieldsi.PivotItems.Count             name1  .PivotFieldsi.PivotItemsX.Name             cleans up name by eliminating the hierarchy labels             splitName  Splitname1, amp             Cellsr, c  splitName2             r  r  1         Next         c  c  1     Next End With End Sub codepre  pThis gets a list of all of the unique values that I have emusedem in the pivot table, but doesnt even touch unused fields. Similarly, this can be sort of helpful, but it isnt quite there.p  pWhat I really need is a little bit of each to suit my fancy, again, I dont think the methods exist. I do understand that what Im asking might be computationally expensive and likely quite slow and that Im not using the right tools for the task at hand. OLAP respects [the application] permissions, while giving [me] direct SQL access would not is my IT depts excuse.p  pAnyway, if you have any ideas, Im all ears.p  pThanks Tomp

Negative 10256 pOur MongoDB setup uses three replica set shards. Each webserver runs a mongos instance locally, and the client node.js processes connect through that using Mongoose 3.6.20 and nodemongodbnative. So nodemongodbnative just connects to mongos on localhost.p  pWhen a replica set primary goes down hard we can simulate this by doing ifdown eth0 on the primary mongos properly detects this, and also detects that a new primary has been elected. So far, so good. But nodemongodbnatives connections to the mongos instance are still open but not functional, and a restart of the node procs is required.p  pOur assumption was that mongos would just kill any established connections to the dead primary and nodemongodbnative would reconnect, but that seems to not be the case both the server and the OS think these connections are open. By contrast, on primary stepDown, the clients fail over fine, connections are closed and reopened.p  pWe are looking at socketTimeoutMS, but that seems incorrect since it causes disconnects for connections that are merely idle.p  pAre we missing configuration to our client or mongos, or do we have to implement our own pingingp

Negative 10256 pIdeally Id like to accomplish two goalsp  ol liPass the codeCameracode preview data to a codeMediaCodeccode encoder via a codeSurfacecode.  I can create the codeSurfacecode using codeMediaCodec.createInputSurfacecode but the codeCamera.setPreviewDisplaycode takes a codeSurfaceHoldercode, not a codeSurfacecode.  li liIn addition to passing the codeCameracode preview data to the encoder, Id also like to display the preview onscreen so the user can actually see what they are encoding.  If the encoder wasnt involved then Id use a codeSurfaceViewcode, but that doesnt appear to work in this scenario since codeSurfaceViewcode creates its own codeSurfacecode and I think I need to use the one created by codeMediaCodeccode.li ol  pIve searched online quite a bit for a solution and havent found one.  Some examples on a hrefhttpbigflake.commediacodecbigflake.coma seem like a step in the right direction but they take an approach that adds a bunch of EGLSurfaceTexture overhead that Id like to avoid.  Im hoping there is a simpler example or solution where I can get the codeCameracode and codeMediaCodeccode talking more directly without involving EGL or textures.p

It always gets cut off in the middle of the line codeat java.lang.reflect.Constructor.constructNativeNative Mcode. Notice how it even stops midword.p  pIve also grabbed the log files directly from the device and they show the same cut off.p  pI can see that it has something to do with codeGradesListAdapter.getViewcode. Debugging and stepping into that line leads to Android system code.p  pWhat could be causing Android to stop midline in its output Are there other ways to debug an app that might give better resultsp

Negative 10256 pIve created a Listview simple, with ArrayAdapter using ArrayList filled of Strings. I used the standard layout android.R.layout.simplelistitem1. I need, from code, to change the background color from a row, knowing its position, but not using onClick event in this case the event give me the view.  I need extract the View of Row from this Listview in a position specific and last, change the background.p  pIve usedp  precodeint position  13 example View v  listaParrafos.getChildAtposition if v  null     v.setBackgroundColorColor.GRAY codepre  pit works in little lists.p  pMy problem is that my ListView has 133 rows, and getChildAtposition use position from visible rows, not from all ListView.  For example, if Ive in my screen, the rows between positions 10 and 20 of listview, if I use listaParrafos.getChildAt0 return me the view from real position 10 in listview.p  pI need return the real view from position to change the background. How I can to do thatp

Negative 10256 pIm currently working on a neural network for speech recognition in MATLAB, and have extracted MFCCs for classification purposes. Currently there are 500 features for each 1second speech clip, and there are five different classes i.e. five different wordsp  pI am using two different batches of speech clips One is 500 files that I am using to train the neural network as well as validationtesting as per the nprtools usual computations. The other is made up of 250 files and is purely for testing purposes. Both batches were generated in one go.p  pUsing the first batch, I am able to obtain nearperfect trainingvalidationtesting accuracy 95100. However, when I try testing with the second batch i.e. the separate 250 files, accuracy drops down to 20. As there are five classes, this initially lead me to think that the neural network is simply picking classes at random. However, looking at the confusion matrix, it seems that the first class is being recognised with 95100 accuracy  however the other voice files are being completely misclassified.p  pMy first thought is that overfitting has occurred somehow. Im aware that MapMiniMax function is used by the nprtool for normalisation purposes  could this be destroying the generalisation properties of the neural network Or is there another step in between the training and testing that I am missingp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 10256 pIm trying to use unit testing to also test for networking.

Negative 10256 pI am attempting to alter a series of 4 .bat files. When I run the program, it prompts me for an input and then writes it to the .bat file. p  pI took the code below from the microsoft documentation on File.Openwrite, then added some variables to point to the files. p  pAs opposed to copypasting the code that actually writes the text, I put a for loop around it with the intent of altering the argument so that the File.OpenWrite piece will look to a different variable and so a different pathdirectory during each iteration.

Negative 10256 pI have built a keyboard with some down arrows to allow for navigation on a tableView.  When the cell the user is on reaches the bottom, I auto scroll the next cell up for them.  I had to disable the buttons during the scrolling animations because it could cause a hang, however for some reason recently, this functionality stopped working.p  pAfter investigation I noticed that its because the scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation delegate is being called multiple times before the animation actually finishes.  It seems like its called just before animation starts, the middle of the animation, and at the end.p  pHas anyone seen anything like this before Or know why this would be happeningp
Negative 10256 pIm using Eclipse CDT 4.4.0 in which I imported the OpenJDK code as a project.

Negative 10256 pIn implementing my own C11 compiler, Im trying to figure out how exactly to handle the codePragmacode keywordoperator. C11 6.10.9 describes codePragmacode as being an operator, so it seems possible to redefine it with macros, i.e. codedefine Pragmax SOMEOTHERMACROxcode. Further, the statement codeundef Pragmacode should have no effect assuming no prior codedefinecode of codePragmacode. This is similar to how keywords can be codedefinecoded, such as the old VC hack codedefine for if 0  else forcode. However, because the codePragmacode operator is evaluated during translation phase 3, the same phase as executing preprocessor directives, its not clear whether this is an exception the standard doesnt mention whether its undefined behavior to use codePragmacode as a macro name.p  pI did some testing with GCC using the following codep  precodedefine PRAGMA Pragma PRAGMAmessage hi  Pragma message sup  undef PRAGMA  undef Pragma define Pragmax Pragmamessage hello codepre  pCompiling with codegcc stdc11 pedantic Wall Wextra ccode outputsp  precodetmp.c21 note pragma message hi  PRAGMAmessage hi   tmp.c41 note pragma message sup  Pragma message sup   tmp.c88 warning undefining Pragma [enabled by default]  undef Pragma          tmp.c109 error expected declaration specifiers or ... before string constant  Pragmamessage hello           codepre  pIf I add the line codeundef Alignofcode, GCC doesnt complain about it.p  pThis suggests that GCC implements codePragmacode through a macro via the warning message, and that undefining it results in a compile error. If I uncomment codedefine Pragmaxcode, the error goes away as the string literal disappears.p  pSo, my questions arep  ol liAre implementations allowed to define codePragmacode as just a macro, and not implement it as an operatorli liIf not, is GCC wrong in doing soli liif codePragmacode is supposed to be an operator, is it undefined behavior to define codePragmacode as a macroli liIs there any ordering between codePragmacode evaluation and other preprocessor directives Or do they have the same precedence i.e. theyre evaluated inorderli ol  pAgain, looking through the C11 standard does not mention anything about codePragmacode other than its an operator that can be used for codepragmacode directives.p

Negative 10256 pI have done some research into this because I have noticed that my custom cells are not receiving the tap event. I have an NSLog that is in place to debug when the cell has been tapped. My problem though is that the cell only receives the event on a long press.

After doing this it still does not receive the event except on a long press.

Negative 10256 pIm working on my first jQuery Mobile site, which is a prototype for a Location Based Game in Brisbane, Australia a hrefhttpwww.jsjensen.dksoleil relnofollowwww.jsjensen.dksoleilap  pMy question is based on viewing from a mobile device, but a desktop device have very similar problems. I have tested with Chrome and Safari on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Same problem everywhere.p  pI think its related to how jQuery Mobile loads and displays pages, but Im not using multiple pages in one HTML document, but have multiple HTML document.p  pIf you go to the website above and then click QUESTS in the menu, followed by Stairway to Knowledge you will end on soleilquest01.html desktop and soleilsoleilquest01.html. That soleil really confuses mep  pIn this first try the JavaScript for handling answers in the text input is not loaded. That means nothing happens when you press Unlock.p  pNow, if you reload on desktop or edit the address on iOS to soleilquest01.html which is the actual and real file it will reload the page with the right JavaScript loaded and initialized.p  pNow Im able to go back pressing QUESTS in the menu and then go to another page e.g. Citadel of Fun with the same problem the JavaScript not loading. If I go back to the other one Stairway to Knowledge the JavaScript is, however, still loaded and working just fine.p  pSo what happens here Im pretty sure my linkingcoding is correct, but its just a basic understanding of jQuery Mobile that Im missing. Can I change something to make this work It could really be awesomep

Negative 10256 pI have been charged with the task to send data from COM 1 to COM 2 in Windows CE 4.2. A running application takes data from COM 1 and displays it to the user in a form textbox I assume. I then have to take that data and send it out COM 2. COM 1 is being used by the program displaying the data and I know of no way to hijack COM 1. p  pI figure trying to do a screen scrap would be the next step. Unfortunately this is compact framework and  an old version at that and from a lot of research it seems managed code is out of the question . Many of the API functions I would use are not available FindWindowEx for example. p  pHere is where I am at now. I have created two projects. One runs with a TextBox and some wording. A separate application runs and tries to read the text in that TextBox. I have been able to find the running process based off the name of the form using FindWindow API. Using code I have found on this site I have even been able to enumerate through the controls of the form. However my TextBox is never found and many of the controls that are found where never placed on the form by myself listbox, button. I assume those are the forms initial controls. p  pDoes anyone have any experience with this Currently this is in C but VB or Visual C will be fine. Even if you have any ideas on a third party application. BTW I am not given the option to upgrade to a higher version of compact framework.p  pThank you.p  pAn update I just found out about. It does not look like I only screen scrape only new data but instead have to screen scrape the entire screen and send it out COM2. Someone will scan a barcode and I will send out all screen data through COM2. The data may include a picture etc.p

Negative 10256 pSo requirements actually the law have changed, and the client wants to be able to addremove values from what is currently an enum. So I need to create a database table instead that allows the client to dynamically deal with the list of values at runtime.p  pCurrently there is a table in my database called codetblJobcode, this table has a column codePaymentTypescode of type codeintcode which corresponds to the enum that has been used. So every time a new job is created in the system, the user selects a PaymentType from this enum list, and it is stored as a new record in codetblJobcodep  pTo deal with the new requirements, I have added a new table codetblPaymentTypescode, and hardcoded the current enum list into the table. Each value here has a unique codeGUIDcode identifier. Thats all good.p  pNow, for each new job, the codePaymentTypecode options are retrieved from the database and the user selects one. However, I need to change the strongtypestrong of the column codePaymentTypescode in the table codetblJobcode to allow for codeGUIDcode values instead of integers. p  pI could do this but what about all the existing records who all have a integer value as the codePaymentTypecode  p  pFrom MSDN on modifying column types with existing data in themp  blockquote   pModifying the data type of a column that already contains data can result in the permanent loss of data when the existing data is converted to the new type. In addition, code and applications that depend on the modified column may fail. These include queries, views, stored procedures, userdefined functions, and client applications. Note that these failures will cascade. For example, a stored procedure that calls a userdefined function that depends on the modified column may fail. Carefully consider any changes you want to make to a column before making it.p blockquote  pWhich makes perfect sense.p  pTo avoid this question being too localized, these are the general questions Im askingp  ul liHow do I deal with existing records when changing the column type Do I have to write a onetime script that maps the current value into the new codeGUIDcode value.li liIs the usage of a database table to replace the enum, even the correct choice in this situation Is there any concept of a dynamic enum in Cli ul  pAny helppointers are appreciated.p

Negative 10256 pI am replacing the showModalDialog function in several web applications. A javascript function was made using two overlays one masks all content on the page, and the other shows popup content. Because some pages invoke showModalDialog two or three times, the javascript replacement manages multiple calls by doing new overlays over what is already there. It works well in Chrome, IE, and FF.p  pBut I want the pop up content to be more in the form of a window with a title bar, because I like windowing. It is easy to thread poppedup content. Since underlying content is masked, nothing beneath can be acted upon, and only poppedup content can be acted upon. The javascript function has several parameters such as whether to mask underlying content, whether to use a border, etc. To fully replicate showModalDialog I want the function to return a value in addition to displaying content. I want the function to add a submit button, optionally, but instead of a cancel button I want a title bar with a big X or reversecolor square.p  pFinally to the question, how do I make a title bar with an X or square at one end, without using a table We have screen readers and applications need to meet accessibility standards. Tables in a page are more difficult for people using screen readers and should be avoided when possible. The title bar will have the same border color passed to the function as an argument, or black default. Thanksp

One way to do that would be to create a whole set of points that wont be displayed when codegeompointcode but that would be positioned at the same x position as the point that follows or the same x position as the point the preceeds and at the same y position as the point that precedes or the same y position as the point that follows.

A file is characterized by its revision. Lets say the revision is added to file name, and there is a symlink to the file which can be used by the processes to read it. The processes cannot for some reasons synchronize with mutexes, semaphores and so on, but they are able to create auxiliary files and folders. Are they able to perform revisionbased CompareandSwap modifications of the file create a new file, create and rename symlink, in the meaning that if several processes are going to modify it simultaneously, one will success and the rest will fail with some error codep  pThe algorithm has to be resistant to sudden termination of any processes at any step of algorithm.p

However, codefadecode will keep updating itself at code1code , which I feel like its a waste if this is calculating for the entire time the app is running.p  pAlso, I cant figure out how to fade the texts in one by one using this method.p  pSo how should I do this I have a feeling my way is probably completely wrong, but Im not familiar enough is libGDX to know how to do it anyway else.p

Negative 10256 pIs it ok to implement multisite tracking feature using new analytics.js when another site uses ga.jsp  pBackground I had to develop a site, which is a part of bigger multisite conglomerate. There are links which are leading out to other sites for FAQs, registration forms etc.p  pClient asked originally to use analytics.js, but after their site went live, their marketing department asked me to add multisite tracking and their example code uses old ga.js. It seems to me, that client probably doesnt know anything about js or GA implementation, but just copies examples from GA page.p  pI implemented it using new analytics.js, but there is no feedback from client, thats why I am asking here if anyone has any experience or insights.p

Error code  0x80010119code for one of my app. And also when stopping the threads for these dll, codeCoUninitializecode is called in both of them. Here I get a crash.

Negative 10256 pFor several years, Ive been creating my dynamic sql paging by wrapping it into a CTE with codeROWNUMBERcode.  This method has been mentionned sevral times in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4359183315493stackoverflowa and it offer good performance.p  pHowever, since sql server 2012 has introduced codeoffsetcode and codefetchcode with even better performance, I decided to see if I could optimize my sql 2008 R2 paging statement to match sql server 2012 performance.p  pThis a hrefhttpsqlblogcasts.comblogssqlandthelikearchive20120426offsetwithoutoffset.aspx relnofollowblog entrya describe a very interesting alternative to the codeoffsetcode commandp  precodeWITH cteKeySeek AS  SELECT         BusinessEntityID,        LastName,        ROWNUMBER OVER ORDER BY LastName,BusinessEntityID1 AS RowN   FROM Person.Person  SELECT        TOP20 cteKeySeek.LastName,       FirstName,       cteKeySeek.BusinessEntityID,       RowN  FROM cteKeySeek  INNER LOOP JOIN Person.Person     ON cteKeySeek.BusinessEntityID  Person.BusinessEntityID  WHERE RowN gt 20 AND RowNlt39  ORDER BY LastName,BusinessEntityID codepre  pHowever, this alternative mentioned above is using an indexed table while my needs are for dynamic sql.  I tried several way to create a similar implementation for a dynamic sql statement without success... the performance is  10x slower than the regular CTE  ROWNUMBERS method.p  pHeres the best implementation I could create so farp  precodeWITH T1 AS  ltlt Your Dynamic SQL here gtgt   SELECT TOP 100 T2.RowN , T2.

However this makes it impossible to share images across multiple apps from a common library project, consequently we have the same images in multiple projects. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2490884whyiscopyandpasteofcodedangerousThis is bada. p  pstrongAdditional Informationstrongp  pI see this in the diagnostic build logp  precode2gtAAPT  error  9patch image CWorkspaceDroidAppobjDebuglibraryprojectsCore.Droidlibraryprojectimportsresdrawablemdpitextfieldactivatedhololight.9.png malformed. 2gt         No marked region found along edge. TaskId145 2gt         Found along top edge. TaskId145 codepre  pHowever I think this is a symptom of the problem, not necessarily the cause because the image that is included in the project is not malformed in fact, if I make a direct reference to the project strongCore.Droidstrong instead of using the NuGet package it works. However, if I browse to the path in the error, then the image is indeed malformed the 9patch borders are removed.  So the question is how does this happen Why when its a NuGet project does it strip the borders out I do know that if I grab the image from an .apk then the 9patch borders are in fact removed so perhaps somewhere in the build process when building the NuGet package this happens whereas when the project is included as a direct reference that step does not happen is there a way to prevent that step from happening in a NuGet buildp  pstrongAdditional Information IIstrongp  pIf I build the NuGet package on my local machine and use that NuGet package then it works. Its only with the TeamCitys NuGet package that the 9patch doesnt work.p

Negative 10256 pI find the existing Spark implementations for accessing a traditional Database very restricting and limited. Particularlyp  ol liUse of Bind Variables is not possible.li liPassing the partitioning parameters to your generated SQL is very restricted.li ol  pMost bothersome is that I am not able to customize my query in how partitioning takes place, all it allows is to identify a partitioning column, and upper  lower boundaries, but only allowed is a numeric column and values. I understand I can provide the query to my database like you do a subquery, and map my partitioning column to a numeric value, but that will cause very inefficient execution plans on my database, where partition pruning true Oracle Table Partitions, and or use of indexes is not efficient. p  pIs there any way for me to get around those restriction ... can I customize my query better ... build my own partition logic. Ideally I want to wrap my own custom jdbc code in an Iterator that I can be executed lazily, and does not cause the entire resultset to be loaded in memory like the JdbcRDD works.p  pOh  I prefer to do all this using Java, not Scala.p

Negative 10256 pOk so this question is actually in two parts.p  pI coded a video filter for VLC and I would like to add a control to the Video Effects panel on the OS X UI. So far Ive been able to link my plugin the the UI by hijacking one of the existing controls, but this isnt ideal.p  pNow, if I open up the Xcode project Im running Xcode 6.3.1 and try to open the codeVideoEffect.xibcode file, I get the following error img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh4dCO.png altXCode error messagep  pI tried to google this but it sounds like the only alternative would be to play archaeologist and dig up an old copy of Xcode 3. Is there any other way to be able to open this file and edit it somehow I tried to look at the XML code but if I started to change that Id do more damage than good.p  pThe second thing Id like to do is sending back values from the effect module to the UI. At the moment by hijacking one of the existing sliders, all I can do is read a value from the panel withp  precodeconfigChainParsepfilter, FILTERPREFIX, ppszfilteroptions, pfiltergtpcfg pfiltergtpsysgtifactor  varCreateGetIntegerCommandpfilter, FILTERPREFIX factor codepre  pand then, inside the callback functionp  precodepsysgtifactor  VLCCLIP newval.iint, 0, 255  codepre  pHowever, I havent been able to write back the value. Id like the filter to set codepsysgtifactorcode to a random value at start. This works using codevarSetIntegercode, but it isnt reflected in the position of the slider in the Video Effect panel.

Negative 10256 pI am at an intermediate level in Database  sqlite. Here is my understanding The search or reading mechanism becomes faster if we do indexing on the given field. However, in my case the field is the text  for example a long title of the movie. As far as I know, the indexing on text is expensive also it will need a lot of memory.  Since, I have an embedded system that runs sqlite, how can I make the select query faster for the text field. Is there any way to do so without indexing Note, I cannot convert the given strings to numbers.p  pThe use case is the following In STB, the user goes to a search filter option, the user starts typing the movie name, and the UI starts showing the movie name when the characters entered by the user exceeds 3. How can I optimize the DB to get the results  select query works fastp

Negative 10256 pIm working with ExtJS 4.x and Sencha Architect 2.2 but this should be relevant to later versions and any application that uses the codeExt.Loadercode class to dynamically load scripts, including Sencha Touch.p  pBy default codeExt.Loadercode adds a strongdc...strong cache busting parameter to make sure that the latest version of each script is loaded into the browser. When deploying to a production or betatest environment this is a good thing as it ensures the usertester gets the latest script each time you deploy and update, but for a development environment this is not really necessary because developers know to use browser techniques like strongctrlF5strong to force a reload of all the scripts. Whats more the cache busting gets in the way of debugging as breakpoints etc are lost whenever you reload the app in the browser.p  pCache busting is disabled by setting disableCaching to false in the codeExt.Loadercode configuration. For examplep  precodeExt.Loader.setConfig     enabled true,     disableCaching false  codepre  pIn this snippet the dynamic loading is emenabledem and cache busting is emdisabledem.

Its a PowerPoint AddIn written in C, but I could adapt it from any other sample in other language VBA, VB, PowerShell...p  pOf course doing it manually with the Review, Language Settings is working perfectly.p  pMy code gets the selected range in a Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint.TextRange read from Globals.ThisAddIn.Application.ActiveWindow.Selection.TextRangep  pIve also started some tests with a Microsoft.Office.Core.TextRange2p  pThese objects contain a LanguageID property. Setting it to msoLanguageIDNoProofing is ignored other real languages work, though. It seems coherent with the GUI display, where there are two properties, the selected language and a separate checkbox to disable the Spell Check.p  pIve displayed the TextRange properties for two similar ranges, one with the Do Not Check Spelling setting set manually... and it seems theres not an evident difference on them.p  pSo I found by chance the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Range object.  It contains both the LanguageID, and a separate NoProofing property...  so probably PowerPoint is using this Word object when editing Ranges.p  pMy question is, how can I Cast or Convert the Powerpoint.TextRange to a Word.Range p

Oftentimes, the execution of this AngularJS function results in the browser navigating to the desired page, but as soon as the new content finishes loading, the path in the address bar disappears so the url is codehttpswww.example.comcode.p  pMy question is not what the cause could be but if you know that, please share but rather do you have any ideas stronghow I can debug this behaviourstrong Where should I put a debug point Ive tried putting it in codeTurbolinks.visitcode, but that appears to execute entirely without producing the negative behaviour indeed, when I run codeTurbolinks.visitcode from the Developer Tools console, it never produces the bug described above.p

Negative 10256 pHi,p  pyou all know the site mega.co.nz, right This site has an interesting feature once they ban your account you cant access the site anymore. Unless you use private browsing which leads me to think they use some kind of cookie to prevent you from accessing again. The thing is that I searched my browser cookies and I didnt find anything with the address mega.co.nz in it so seems like they use some method to conceal it and make it harder for you to find it and delete it. I would like to know which method is this so I can implement it in my own site seems I consider it pretty effective to get rid of spammers and other undesired users.p  pThank you.p
Negative 10256 pSo I built an App using Firebase as backend. Now I need to use Stripe to charge use and send payment or PayPal, whichever works. And I google around solutions. Most of them do require a backend with Node.js. But that defeat the purpose of using Firebase at the first place. I use Firebase bc I do not want to build an backend with Node.js.  Then I heard stamplay. I do the same thing as Firebase but also provide out of the box integration with Stripe and Mailchimp.  I do not want to change my app and keep using Firebase Authorization, managing users and store most of the data in Firebase. But come to dealing with payment, I want to use stamplay to connect with Stripe. But I do not where to start. So far, seem like the only way to use stamplay stripe with AngularJS is to use stamplay user Authorization, create user in stamplay and then use Stripe task  ditching Firebase completely. Can someone point me in the right direction use both these amazing services together  stamplay for APIs and Firebase for everything else   p

Negative 10256 pI am creating an application using express and I ran into an issue using module.exports. I have a route that will handle checking out a user a creating a pdf based on their order. To keep things modular I have been separating my route functionality into modules and requiring them when necessary, for examplep  pstrongRoute1.jsstrongp  precodemodule.exports  functionreq, res     route functionality  codepre  pstrongroutesindex.jsstrongp  precodeRoute1  require.Route1 router.postapiv1route1, Route1 codepre  pThis has been working great to keep things organized, but I created a route with a lot of complex functionality and there seems to be an issue with caching. The first time I call the route it works fine, but the second time I call it it gets stuck in an infinite loop because one of the variables from the last request is persisting and it never breaks out of the loop because it is greater than the number that it needs to equal for the loop to exit. I am even resetting all of the variables at the beginning of the function that is passed through module.exports. p  pTo fix the problem I am no longer exporting the route functionality and instead passing it directly to the route. Here is an examplep  pstrongWorks everytimestrongp  precoderouter.postapiv1dostuff, functionreq, res     var count  0      var doSomething  function         if count  something else break         else add one to count and run this function again       codepre  pstrongWorks the first timestrongp  pstrongdosomething.jsstrongp  precodemodule.exports  functionreq, res     var count  0      var doSomething  function         if count  something else then break out and do something else         else add one to count and run this function again          This works the first time but the second time          count is persisting and it is already greater than          the number I am checking against so it          never breaks out of this function       codepre  pstrongroutesindex.jsstrongp  precodevar doSomething  require.dosomething.js   Only works as expected the first time the call is made router.postapiv1dosomething, doSomething codepre  pSo why when using module.exports does my function only work as expected once I am thinking is has something to do with node module caching.p

Then I want it to count how many rows it takes from going from the highest quantity to whatever ID you supply it with. So for example, If I was looking for the ID 4, It would look through the quantity from from greatest to least, then tell me that it is row 2 because it took only 2 rows to reach it since it contains the 2nd highest quantity. p  pThere is another way I can code this, but I feel it is too demanding of a resource and involves PHP. I can do a loop on my database based on the greatest to least, and every time it goes through another loop, I add 1. So, that way, I could do an IF statement to determine when it reaches my value. However, when I have thousands of values it would have to go through, I feel like that would be too resource demanding. p

Negative 10256 pIn my arquillian test a number of application methods are called, which either read data from the database or create data and persist to database. At some point a method annotated with codeTransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIRESNEWcode is called. The test fails as the annotated method cannot findon read it returns 0 records some data persisted by some previous called methodsannotated with TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED. Probably this is a normal behavior as a new Transaction opens. Reading the data in a previous called method and passing them as parameters to the annotatedTransactionAttributeType.REQUIRE method works fine, but data should be read inside the REQUIRESNEW method. Same problem appears in other tests when the TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRESNEW is used. Is there a workaround to handle this case p
