Positive 58706 pOur application has been working in offline mode for a long period of time. During latest version it stopped. We identified that it is connected with the size of the application due the size of all new controllers and the way Sencha copy the files to the local store for the upgrade process. Copying all files to the local store is exhausting the space so at the end some files are not copied there but the device  has a copy locally based on the manifest. We are not using the mechanism of delta upgrade, we always update the application entirely. p  pIs there anyway we can bypass this process of copying files to the local store or do not verify against the local store and trust entirely in the manifest mechanism using the standards of HTML 5p

The company consuming the Xml files I write suggested that writing without the pretty print will not affect them, and will significantly decrease the size of the files. With a little playing around in the System.Xml namespace, I did find a solution. However, in my searching I did not find the answer anywhere, so I thought it might be helpful to someone else in the future if I posted the question. Also, I wouldnt be surprised at all if theres a better or at least different way of accomplishing this.p  pFor those that dont know I didnt until today, Xml pretty print isp  precodeltxml version1.0 standaloneyesgt ltNewDataSetgt   ltFoogt     ltBargtabcltBargt   ltFoogt ltNewDataSetgt codepre  pWithout pretty print it looks like thisp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gtltNewDataSetgtltFoogtltBargtabcltBargtltFoogtltNewDataSetgt codepre  pAdditionally, the size savings was significant, 70mb files are becoming about 40mb.

Negative 58706 pI have two tables on mysql users, and management. The users table has a numeric id, and the management table has a varchar foreign key which is the primary key of the other table. The types are not the same, and this seems to be the main problem when I build an index from the User model, and try to include one column from the management table. The join that thinkinx sphinx generates takes too much damn time to execute, and thus the index never gets done. I know the best solution is to change the management table and use a numeric id, but right now that seems to be too expensive.

Negative 58706 pWe all know why Java doesshould not have multiple inheritance. So this is not questioning about what has already been debated tillcowscomehome.p  pThis discusses what we would do when we wish to create a class that has the characteristics of two or more other classes.p  pProbably, most of us would do this to inherit from three classes. For simplicity, I left out the constructor.  p  precodeclass Car extends Vehicle    final public Transport transport   final public Machine machine  codepre  pSo that, Car class directly inherits methods and objects of Vehicle class, but would have to refer to transport and machine explicitly to refer to objects instantiated in Transport and Machine.p  precodeCar car  new Car car.drive  from Vehicle car.transport.isAmphibious  from Transport car.machine.getCO2Footprint  from Machine codepre  pI thought this was a good idea until when I encounter frameworks that require setter and getter methods. For example, the XMLp  precodeltCar amphibiousfalse footPrint1000 modelFordstatic999gt codepre  pwould look for the methods setAmphibious.., setFootPrint.. and setModel... Therefore, I have to project the methods from Transport and Machine classes p  precodeclass Car extends Vehicle    final public Transport transport   final public Machine machine   public void setAmphibiousboolean b     this.transport.setAmphibiousb      public void setFootPrintString fp     this.machine.setFootPrintfp     codepre  pThis is OK, if there were just a few characteristics. Right now, I am trying to adapt all of SmartGWT into GWT UIBinder, especially those classes that are not a GWT widget. There are lots of characteristics to project.p  pWouldnt it be nice if there exists some form of annotation framework that is like thisp  precodeclass Car extends Vehicle projects Transport projectsMachine projects Guzzler     No need to explicitly instantiate Transport, Machine or Guzzler    ....  codepre  pWhere, in case of common names of characteristics exist, the characteristics of Machine would take precedence Guzzlers, and Transports would have precedence over Machines, and Vehicles would have precedence over Transports. The annotation framework would then instantiate Transport, Machine and Guzzler as hidden members of Car and expand to breakout the protectedpublic characteristics, in the precedence dictated by the project annotation sequence, into actual source code or into bytecode. Preferably into bytecode. So that the setFootPrint method is found in both Machine and Guzzler, only that of Machines would be projected.p  pQuestionsp  ol liDont you think this is a good idea to have such a frameworkli liDoes such a framework already exist Tell me wherewhat.li liIs there an eclipse plugin that does itli liIs there a proposal or plan anywhere that you know about such an annotation frameworkli ol  pIt would be wonderful too, if the annotationplugin framework lets me specify that boolean, int, or whatever else needs to be converted from String and does the conversionparsing for me too.p  pPlease advise, somebody.

Negative 58706 pIm asking because of the discussion thats been provoked in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2597142whenwasthenullmacronot02597232this threada.p  pTrying to have a serious backandforth discussion using comments under other peoples replies is not easy or fun.  So Id like to hear what our C experts think without being restricted to 500 characters at a time.  p  pThe C standard has precious few words to say about codeNULLcode and null pointer constants. Theres only two relevant sections that I can find.  Firstp  blockquote   h33.2.2.3 Pointersh3      pAn integral constant expression with   the value 0, or such an expression   cast to type void  , is called a null   pointer constant. If a null pointer   constant is assigned to or compared   for equality to a pointer, the   constant is converted to a pointer of   that type. Such a pointer, called a   null pointer, is guaranteed to compare   unequal to a pointer to any object or   function.p blockquote  pand secondp  blockquote   h34.1.5 Common definitions h3      pThe macros arep  precodeNULL codepre      pwhich expands to an implementationdefined null pointer constantp blockquote  pThe question is, can codeNULLcode expand to an implementationdefined null pointer constant that is different from the ones enumerated in 3.2.2.3  p  pIn particular, could it be defined asp  precodedefine NULL builtinmagicnullpointer codepre  pOr even p  precodedefine NULL void1 codepre  pMy reading of 3.2.2.3 is that it specifies that an integral constant expression of 0, and an integral constant expression of 0 cast to type void must be among the forms of null pointer constant that the implementation recognizes, but that it isnt meant to be an exhaustive list.  I believe that the implementation is free to recognize other source constructs as null pointer constants, so long as no other rules are broken.  p  pSo for example, it is provable that p  precodedefine NULL 1 codepre  pis not a legal definition, because inp  precodeif NULL     dostuff  codepre  pcodedostuffcode must not be called, whereas withp  precodeif 1    dostuff codepre  pcodedostuffcode must be called since they are equivalent, this cannot be a legal definition of codeNULLcode.  p  pBut the standard says that integertopointer conversions and viceversa are implementationdefined, therefore it could define the conversion of 1 to a pointer as a conversion that produces a null pointer.  In which case  p  precodeif void1  codepre  pwould evaluate to false, and all would be well.  p  pSo what do other people think  p  pId ask for everybody to especially keep in mind the asif rule described in code2.1.2.3 Program executioncode.  Its huge and somewhat roundabout, so I wont paste it here, but it essentially says that an implementation merely has to produce the same observable sideeffects as are required of the abstract machine described by the standard.  It says that any optimizations, transformations, or whatever else the compiler wants to do to your program are perfectly legal so long as the observable sideeffects of the program arent changed by them.  p  pSo if you are looking to prove that a particular definition of codeNULLcode cannot be legal, youll need to come up with a program that can prove it.  Either one like mine that blatantly breaks other clauses in the standard, or one that can legally detect whatever magic the compiler has to do to make the strange NULL definition work.  p  pSteve Jessop found an example of way for a program to detect that codeNULLcode isnt defined to be one of the two forms of null pointer constants in 3.2.2.3, which is to stringize the constantp  precodedefine stringizehelperx x define stringizex stringizehelperx  codepre  pUsing this macro, one couldp  precodeputsstringizeNULL codepre  pand detect that NULL does not expand to one of the forms in 3.2.2.3.  Is that enough to render other definitions illegal  I just dont know.  p  pThanksp

Negative 58706 pFrom what I understand about GTK, if I have a TreeView, I cant just use any widget I want to display information about a column. For text, you need a codegtk.CellRendererTextcode. For toggle buttons, a codegtk.CellRendererTogglecode. For anything else, it seems you have to implement yourself, which, from a sample one for buttons that I saw, doesnt look straightforward.p  pFirstly, is this the case Is there an easy way to set up whatever widget you want to be used to display some text If not, then why is it implemented this way If I were designing GTK i would just create some sort of system where when a row was added and when some data model information changes, userspecified callbacks would be called which would add the appropriate widget or change it, respectively.p

Negative 58706 pIm working on a logging database in SQL Server 2008.  Itll consist mainly of one table something like thisp  precodeStepLog     StepLogID   ClientID   LogContent   XML   CreateDate codepre  pBasically what will happen in this table is that various clients will log certain activities to this table.  The LogContent field will be XML  untyped because we dont know what clients want to log.p  pTo allow the LogContent field to be searched, the current plan is to shred out the LogContent field programmatically.   The metadata for shredding would be in a table something like the followingp  precodeXPathAttribute    XPathAttributeID   AttributeName   AttributeDescription   XPath codepre  pUpon insert of a record into StepLog, we would have a stored procedure that would take all the Xpaths defined in XPathAttribute, and write them out to another table, XPathAttributeValuep  precodeXPathAttributeValue    XPathAttributeValueID   StepLogID   AttributeID   AttributeValue  codepre  pMy original idea, when looking at this design, was why not just use the XML indexes, both primary and secondary  That would avoid lots of work on our side, and use builtin functionality.p  pI dont have a lot of experience with XML indexes, and the original designer had some poor experiences with XML indexes poor performance in SQL Server2005, thats how this design originated.  p  pFeedback would be very much appreciatedp  pthanks, Sylviap

Negative 58706 pIve come across an undesirable effect of using JointStyle.MITER when clearingredrawing graphics.p  pMy project involves managing custom line graphics with both round and sharp edges, which is why I would like to use a miter joint style.p  pWhen the line thickness is greatly increased, even the round areas of the line are affected by the miter style.  While I find this unfortunate, its understandable and not the bug Im referring to.  the bug occurs when decreasing the line thickness doesnt completely clear the graphics, as instructed to do so by the code each time the thickness changes, leaving artifacts of the line graphics where the line once was.  Artifacts are also left by sharp edges, not just rounded corners.p  pIm using Flash Player version 10.1.53.64 on Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.4.p  pYou can test this by running my sample code below.  use the left and right keyboard arrows change the thickness of the stroke of a round rect.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  The graphics artifacts are superficial.

Negative 58706 pI have a COM object developed in c. This class uses another third party COM object, which throws an event EvtThirdParty. This third party object is just a method of my class.p  pNow Im using my COM Object from a .Net VB for what its worth application, and I would like to catch EvtThirdParty from the VB App. Im guessing there is no trivial way to do this, but let this info here just in case someone points one. So, I have added one event EvtThirdPartyDummy to my COM object, and whenever it captures EvtThirdParty, raises an EvtThirdPartyDummy to VB.Net.p  pSo far, so good.p  pNow, when the app receives this event, it must make a couple of calls to my object, to get some information. p  pHeres where my problems begin. I get a weird message about a disconnected contextp  blockquote   pDisconnected Context was detectedp      pMessage Context 0x1b9351e0 is   disconnected.

There are some differences e.g., the title of my message says Visual Studio 2005, IIRC, but this could be due to a different IDE versionp  pFor what I have found in google, it seems like the thread in which the object was created has been destroyed, but Im pretty sure this is not the case. It is created in the main application thread.p  pIf I remove all the code from the event handler, everything works as a charm.p  pMy best guess is that my event is being handled in a brand new thread, but AFAIK this shouldnt be the case.p  pAny idea about whats going onp

Negative 58706 pGiven a webpage that uses lots of javascript to generate its HTML, how can I get the final computed HTML being parsed by the browser instead of the source HTML In other words, presume a page has lots of  tags surrounding javascript functions that, when called, return some HTML.  When I view the source of the page, I see the script function call, not the HTML it produces.  p  pHow could I get all of the HTML produced by a webpagep  pIve noticed that Firebug appears able to see the HTML instead of the scripts, but it doesnt appear to have any way to save the whole page, only little segments of it.p  pUpdatep  pThanks for all the answers.  However, Im still not getting the HTML I see in Firebugs console with any of those techniques.  For my example page, Im using the Info tab of my own Facebook profile.  If you view source on that page, youll see lots of scripts with the title bigpipe.onPageletArrive.  However, if you look at it in Firebug, each of those function calls renders out to HTML.  I tried the rightclick on the  tag in Firebug, the View Generated Source in the Webdev Toolbar, and the Chrome suggestion, but they all give me the script call, not the HTML.  p  pAny other ideasp  pUpdate 2p  pWhen I said each of those functions renders out to HTML in Firebug, I wasnt quite correct.  They only render out if I select them in the page and right clickInspect Element.  Then it appears to render it out.  So maybe my question has become how do you get Firebug to automatically render out all of the HTML so you can select and save it  Or Im open to any other solution for grabbing this HTML.p

Negative 58706 pI am in the process of developing a specialpurpose network tool with some packet sniffing and decoding capabilities. I am looking for languages designed to assist in the dissectiondecoding of arbitrary packet formats. Idealy, the solution should be based on open standards. There are related questions on SO, but most deal with the full lifecycle of packet sniffing I dont care so much about the capture, there are other libraries that do that well.p  pIn general, what Im looking for is a language and supporting framework for the declaritive definition of packet formats and corresponding runtime decoding. Because this problem can be generalized to any nonnetwork binary data, a solution that does this for arbitrary binary streams would also be in scope. I am a little surprised no such standard currently exists in a mature and robust state at least that I could find  though there seem to be a lot of interesting but notquiteright and almostthere projects see below. Perhaps that speaks to the difficulty of the problem, or maybe to a lack of demand.p  pBy way of example, Im interested in technologies and ideas similar to the following in no particular orderp  ul lia hrefhttpsourceforge.netappsmediawikipacketnetindex.phptitleMainPagePacket.Neta  Does the job of converting from binary packet representations to structures, but the dissectors are all hardcoded and it doesnt appear to be able to handle more complex formats.li lia hrefhttpforge.gridforum.orgprojectsdfdlwgDFDLa  Ive been following this one for a while and was even participating in teleconferences a year or so ago. The standard seems to be reaching maturity, but implementation appears to be challenging. Not that I mind getting my hands dirty, but Im not sure Ive got the resources on this project to implement such a wideranging standard from scratch for this purpose.  li lia hrefhttpnmparsers.codeplex.comNetwork Monitor Open Source Parsersa  This project describes packets using a Clike syntax for use by Microsoft Network Monitor. It has a lot of packets already defined and the language appears robust enough to support complex structures. Unfortunately, the only implemention of an execution engine is in NetMon and while the grammar for the language could probably be reverseengineered, implementing a processing engine might be very difficult. I also worry that because of the explicit tie between the parser language and the NetMon tool there are nongeneral aspects to the language that would make it inappropriate for uses in other tools.li lia hrefhttpwww.nbee.orgdoku.phpidnetpdl3aindexNetPDLa  This one looks very interesting, but development seems to have languished. Its also not totally clear how to make use of the execution engine outside of their own environment.li liWireshark Dissectors  Ive thought about wrappingusing native Wireshark Dissectors for this purpose, but they are tied pretty closely to Wireshark itself. The dissectors also use code to perform most of the decoding, which is a little counter to what Im looking for  Id prefer something thats a little more declaritive though obviously theres a balance since complex packet structures often require switching and other logic to determine the final makeup.li lia hrefhttpwww2002.orgCDROMalternate334BSDLa  An academic language similar in concept to DFDL see above. Interesting and in the right direction, but outside of a couple papers nothing else seems to exist.li ul  pIm not necessarily looking for a complete solution here though if someone knows of one I havent covered, that would be great. Im more interested in comments or anecdotes about the technologies Ive indicated above as well as pointers or ideas for routes I havent thought of or covered.p

Negative 58706 pI have a custom component in my app where I extends a ViewGroup and add a bunch of rows LinearLayouts with data and a small border between them. This looks really good on HVGA screens but it looks terrible on QVGA screens.p  pMy problem is the parts where I want a 1 pixel border which works fine on HVGA but on QVGA some of the borders becomes either 2 pixels or 0 pixel its only one of the two but Ive seen both on different screen sizes. I make the border by having a black linear layout which I set padding to.p  pI guess the problem has something to do with px vs dp as I seen the same thing before when I used px in my layout. But now that Im trying to set the border size in code I can only put px, is there any way around thisp  pIm aware about the calculation you can do to get dp values in code but that doesnt really help me as I have to set integer values so calculating the border will give me 1 or 2 for each row and it will still look bad.p

When i run the app, and check out the different views, the navigationbar colorstyle is correct.p  pOne of my codemainViewscode forwards the user to a codeTTTableViewcodep  precodeUIViewController targetViewController  [[[NSClassFromStringtargetVC alloc] init] autorelease]              iftargetViewController  nil          [[self retain] autorelease]                 [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimatedNO]         targetViewController.title  A Title         [self.navigationController pushViewControllertargetViewController animatedYES]     codepre  pThe code above pops the current viewController and pushes the codetargetViewControllercode onto the stack. This works. However, the codenavigationBarcode colorstyle is now the default one, and not black, as i set it in my codeAppDelegatecode. I have checked the object addresses in the debugger and it is the same codenavigationControllercode  codenavigationBarcode as the one in my coderootViewControllercode.p  pWhen I explicitly set the codenavigationBarcode colorstyle in the targets initializer function, the settings are ignored.p  pAdditionally, when i now hit the backbutton in the navigationbar, the barstylecolor in my codemainViewscode is also incorrect from black to default.p  pAny ideas how I could debugfix thisp
Negative 58706 pI realize there are a ton of questions regarding this issue, but the solution of setting every view in the row.xml to focusablefalse and focusableInTouchModefalse do not work, nor does getting the ListView from the ListActivity and setting setItemsCanFocusfalse.p  pWeirdly, when registered for a context menu, the long tap works. The regular tap though Nope. I tried setting listeners like OnItemClickListener to no avail.p  pI read somewhere that I might be able to remedy this by overriding getView in my Adapter Im not too sure how that works though. Note, I dont want to know what view the user has clicked I just care about the list row being clicked to initiate the corresponding code in onListItemClick.p  pMaybe theres something in my row.xml thats all wrong Or is it affected by the way I set my ListViews adapter placed in onResume instead of onCreate to update informationp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout   xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid   androidlayoutwidthfillparent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidorientationvertical   androidfocusablefalse   androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt ltTextView styleandroidattrlistSeparatorTextViewStyle   androidididlistSectionHeader   androidlayoutwidth  fillparent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidpaddingTop2dp   androidpaddingBottom2dp   androidpaddingLeft5dp   androidtextColorandroidcolorwhite   androidvisibilitygone   androidfocusablefalse   androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt ltRelativeLayout   androidorientationhorizontal   androidlayoutwidthfillparent   androidlayoutheight70dp   androidbackgrounddrawablelistbutton   androidfocusablefalse   androidfocusableInTouchModefalse   androidclickabletrue   androidlongClickabletrue   gt ltTextView androidididitemID     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidvisibilitygone     androidtextStylebold     androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidfocusablefalse     androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt ltCheckBox      androidididreturnedCheckbox     androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue     androidlayoutmargin10dp     androidcheckedfalse     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidfocusablefalse     androidfocusableInTouchModefalse     gt ltLinearLayout     androidlayouttoRightOfidreturnedCheckbox     androidlayoutmargin5dp     androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidth180dp     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidfocusablefalse     androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt     ltTextView          androidididstuffName         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlines1         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidellipsizeend         androidscrollHorizontallytrue         androidtextHey there         androidtextSize25sp         androidtextColorFFF         androidshadowColor000         androidfocusablefalse         androidfocusableInTouchModefalse     gt     ltRelativeLayout         androidididdetailsLayout         androidorientationhorizontal         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidfocusablefalse         androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt         ltTextView              androidididdueListItem             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlines1             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidtextSize14sp             androidtextstringdueListing             androidfocusablefalse             androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt         ltTextView             androidididdueDate             androidlayouttoRightOfiddueListItem             androidlayoutmarginLeft2dp             androidlayoutwidth90dp             androidlines1             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidtextSize14sp             androidtextHEHEHE             androidfocusablefalse             androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt         ltImageView             androidididstarMark             androidlayoutalignRightiddetailsLayout             androidlayouttoRightOfiddueDate             androidlayoutmarginLeft10dp             androidlayoutmarginTop2dp             androidlayoutheight15dp             androidlayoutwidth15dp             androidscaleTypefitXY             androidadjustViewBoundstrue             androidsrcdrawableliststarred             androidvisibilityinvisible             androidfocusablefalse             androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt     ltRelativeLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt ltImageView          androidididcontactPic         androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue         androidlayoutheight48dp         androidlayoutwidth48dp         androidbackgroundFFF         androidlayoutmargin10dp         androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue         androidscaleTypefitCenter         androidpadding3dp         androidfocusablefalse         androidfocusableInTouchModefalse     gt ltImageView          androidididlentArrow         androidvisibilityinvisible         androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidsrcdrawableindicatorlent         androidlayoutmarginTop42dp         androidlayoutmarginRight1dp         androidfocusablefalse         androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt ltRelativeLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre

Negative 58706 pI decided to implement dynamic class loading in my glassfish web application, as a way of trying it out and to support small plugins that could be loaded and executed by the web app at runtime. p  pI added the following classp  precodepublic class PluginManager      private static final String dropBoxDir  filepathtodropbox    private static final URLClassLoader dropBoxClassLoader    static        try           URL dropBoxURL  new URLdropBoxDir          dropBoxClassLoader  URLClassLoader.newInstancenew URL[]dropBoxURL              catch MalformedURLException mue           throw new RuntimeExceptionMalformedURLException thrown during PluginManager initialization  the hardcoded URL   dropBoxDir   must be invalid., mue                this method is called by a web service    public static void runPluginFromDropBoxString fullClassName        try           load the plugin class          Classltgt pluginClass  dropBoxClassLoader.loadClassfullClassName          instantiate it          Runnable plugin  RunnablepluginClass.newInstance          call its run method          plugin.run              catch ClassNotFoundException cnfe           throw new RuntimeExceptionThe class file for   fullClassName   could not be located at the designated directory   dropBoxDir  . Check that the specified class name is correct, and that its file is in the right location., cnfe              catch InstantiationException ie           throw new RuntimeExceptionInstantiationException thrown when attempting to instantiate the plugin class   fullClassName    make sure it is an instantiable class with a noarg constructor., ie              catch IllegalAccessException iae           throw new RuntimeExceptionIllegalAccessException thrown when attempting to instantiate the plugin class   fullClassName    make sure the class and its noarg constructor have public access., iae              catch ClassCastException cce           throw new RuntimeExceptionPlugin instance could not be cast to Runnable  plugin classes must implement this interface., cce             codepre  pThen in a separate project, I created a test pluginp  precodepublic class TestPlugin implements Runnable     Override    public void run        System.out.printlnplugin code executed      codepre  pI deployed the web application, then compiled codeTestPlugincode into a code.classcode file and dropped it into the designated folder. I called a web service that hits coderunPluginFromDropBoxcode with the class name and got the expected output.p  pThis all worked as a proof of concept, but my plugin is effectively useless unless it can be made aware of my web applications classes. Ive since read that code.warcode is intended only as a standalone application, and not meant to be on other libraries classpaths, which doesnt bode well for this little sideproject.p  pI had a look at this discussion a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions169329extendingjavawebapplicationswithpluginsExtending Java Web Applications with pluginsa and get the feeling Im wading into a swamp of design challenges for no huge reason and should turn around. However that post is kind of old and is Tomcatspecific, so I just thought Id ask if theres any straightforward way for me to approach this without some elaborate third party framework.p
Negative 58706 pIf you look a hrefhttproseanneconner.tumblr.com relnofollowherea, you will see upon loading the page there is a DIV at the top. It is called content with contentcontainer wrapped around it and finally, page around that. If you click the bottom left or right arrows you will see other DIVs with the same tags but they are properly vertically aligned. The closest I got to maybe fixing it is when I inspected the first carousel element the one at the top and saw it was indeed height100 like it should. However, if you go to the right or left and inspect the other DIVs they also have height100 When you uncheck height100 the DIV moves to the top. The only idea I have is that perhaps another DIV around page isnt letting page become height100 when first loading the page. Other than that Im 100 lost.p  pYou CANNOT look in the source code because with Tumblr themes you are creating the code separate for each post, so if you look at the source code from your perspective the code is not what it looks like on my end. The entire themes code is below P.S Text and Quote posts are the only posts that are vertically aligned, so please look at those. Im posting the entire code incase I have made a mistake that prevents height100 from loading.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN

Negative 58706 pI would like to take a picture of a fullscreen direct3D game. I know I need to create an overlay which is harder in c and I found out that using printscreen and than pasting it in mspaint does capture the game window.p  pI ended up with this unstable code  p  precode            try                              SendKeys.SendWaitPRTSC                 Thread.Sleep100                 if Clipboard.ContainsImage                     return Clipboard.GetImage                          catch Exception                              throw                          Bitmap bitmap  new Bitmap1, 1             return bitmap codepre  pThis code sometimes work, sometimes it throws an ExternalException and sometimes and Clipboard.ContainsImage returns false and it simply returns a 1,1 sized image.p  pI would like to try and improve that code so I wont have to rely on the time it takes to copy something to the clipboard with thread.sleep20000, itll work but this code is just a part of a larger code that executes every 800ms.p  pSo I need ideas on how to send keys more reliably or get the that method printscreen uses.p
Negative 58706 p2 days Ive been trying to get my head around this, but no joy.p  pI have a simple form that posts to a controller action.

Negative 58706 pIve just read a a hrefhttpwww.quirksmode.orgmobileviewports2.htmlnice article on viewporta which left me with a couple questions regarding Visual viewport vs Layout viewport on mobile devices.p  blockquote   pthe width and the height of the layout viewport are equal to whatever   can be shown on the screen in the maximally zoomedout modep blockquote  pI did not quite understand what that means. When they say maximally zoomedout mode, does that mean that the layout viewport is different for different HTMLs and not specific to different devices like iPad, Xoom, etcp  pSecondly, Ive created a a hrefhttpipad.atwebpages.comviewport.htmldemo pagea to measure these two viewports. Please view this on an iPhoneiPad to get the correct values.p  pI understand that the layout viewport can be changed by setting the meta viewport tag, but that emalsoem changes the visual viewportwhy is that It says that the visual viewport is the part of the page thats currently shown onscreen, so my understanding was that the visual viewport should not be affected by the meta viewport setting.p

Negative 58706 pI recently started using Xcode 4.2 and the iOS 5 simulator. When I update an older version of my app preinstalled in the simulator, it updates the app just fine but the app icon is not updated.

Is this a bug or am I doing something wrongp  pEDIT Still the same problem, but when I quit the simulator and start it again NOT deleting the app, the icon is updated. Thats a little encouraging at least. Has anyone else experienced thisp

Negative 58706 pIve asked question about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7267354javascriptmemoryandhtml5localstoragelimitationsonsmartphonesJavaScript memory and HTML5 LocalStorage limitations on smartphonesa, however the problem became a bit more specific.p  pI need to store for offline usage a lot more data, big part of it are dictionaries. I had an idea to store dictionaries in JavaScript which loads simply array data into JS variable which will be cached for offline usage. Business data for offline will be stored in LocalStorage. Additionally JS memory will hold some cache for online usage, to prevent loading same entity more than one time from server.p  pSo I have question, if using big offline cache say 4MB and storing a lot in memory affects the storage available for LocalStorage Say it can become limited to 3MB because of heavy offline cache usage. Does someone has experience with such applications and had to deal with problems with particular browsers on mobile devicesp  pThe answer to similar to mine question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5109768applicationcachemanifestlocalstoragesizelimit64609436460943Application Cache Manifest  Local Storage Size Limita does not provide the information I need since as fair as I understood the author has tested offline cache limit and LocalStorage limit separately.p  pEven more Im worried about JS memory applications, I fear the browser can be closed without even warning. Testing on one device would not mean the application would not crash on another, less powerfull.p  pSo please write, if you have tested the limits of mobile browsers. Post which only give clues where to search further or describe test scenarios which hasnt finished with effort will also be appreciated. The topic is quite new so Im aware most of researches are drafts only.p  pstrongupdatestrong Ive updated my referred question about LocalStorage limitations, with test on Opera Mobile 11, in which I was able to store much above 5MB limit.p  pAlso according to the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8082930increaseipadcacheover50mbIncrease iPad cache over 50 MBa at least on iPad it is possible to store 50MB of data, hope I would do test on iPhone soon.p

Negative 58706 pWere using libspotify to update playlists that we have generated against a single account that need to be kept up to date over time.  Were using a fork of the spotifyapiserver to do this a hrefhttpsgithub.comtommartinspotifyapiserver relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtommartinspotifyapiserverap  pAfter sending an update to a playlists tracks using libspotify we generally wait for the callback that we passed to spplaylistaddcallbacks to be called before we report a success to the user.  Often this callback arrives within a suitable time frame but increasingly were getting unacceptable delays in receiving this callback.  Sometimes 30 seconds, sometimes even longer, sometimes minutes, sometimes hours.  It seems that generally these delays are caused by libspotify pausing for a period and not calling any callbacks until it seemingly unfreezes and calls all the backed up callbacks in quick succession.p  pIs it reasonable to use this callback as an indicator of a successful playlist update  Is there any obvious reason for these long delaysp

Negative 58706 pIve got a AzureCloud based project single project only. It has a WCFWebRole added to the project. My WCF services are using the entity framework to talk to a SQLAzure database.

So I want to do a small amount of scheduled background processing based on a timer and not an incoming request.

Negative 58706 pIm running a LAMP stack on a linode. The Ubuntu version is Lucid.p  pWhen a PHP script executes a codemkdircode or codemoveuploadedfilecode command, the newly created folderfile winds up being owned by a unix user Grusha. I did create this user, but it should not be owning files. The web folder overall is owned by codewwwdatacode, as is by extension the containing folder inside which the new folderfiles are moving.p  pThe users etcpasswd line is like thisp  precodegrushax10001003,,,homegrushabinbash codepre  pAnd etcgroup is thisp  precodegrushax1003 codepre  pGrusha owns the PHP sessions as theyre created too, although nothing else. No processes or files on the system run as Grusha either.p  pI log in with a public key, and the user who that goes through is not Grusha nor root.p  pWhen I delete Grusha, I can no longer restart Apache. I get codebad usernamecode and the restart fails. My PHP sessions also dont work.  p  pSo in the end I add Grusha again and the server will start and everything works except that scripts make files owned by Grusha, not codewwwdatacode.p  pIve been looking around as much as possible, but cant find any info. My codehttpd.confcode is empty.

Negative 58706 pIm writing a wrapper script using Groovy but the question is really a Java one and would like to know if its possible to create a Process without letting it run first. The problem is that the Process starts running and generating output on stdout and stderr. I would like to forward those to their appropriate destinations and at the same time create a merged stream for processing within the script. The problem Im running into, however, is that the Process generates output too quickly and the output on the first two lines is a bit garbled. I would like to setup the streams before the process starts running. Any way to do thatp

Negative 58706 pHave really been racking my brain on this one.  Want to set an unordered list up in a container div, set a timer to move all list items to the left every one second, then if the right side of the list item is out side of the container it is then animated down to the next row and back to the left side of the div.

Negative 58706 pIm creating some Dojo 1.8 GlossySemiCircularGauge at runtime via javascript and Im trying to set the background color of the gauge.

Negative 58706 pIs it possible to look up for existence of specified attributes in the a hrefhttpsimple.sourceforge.net relnofollowSimplea framework for java Lets say I have the following xmlp  precodeltpacket id250gt   ltmsg id1 uniqueAttribute1some value x7 gt   ltmsg id2 someStuff123 gt   ltmsg id3 someOtherStuffabc gt ltpacketgt codepre  pAll the msgs above should be deserialized into objects of different classes perhaps inherited from a common base class.

Meaning if there in the msg exists attribute named uniqueAttribute then an object of class Foo should be created, if there is someStuff an object of class Bar and so on.p  pThe only way which comes to my mind is to try to deserialize to objects of the classes and catching exceptions and retrying which sounds bad.p  pIf it is not possible with the Simple framework maybe you could suggest some other methodp

Negative 58706 pI have an application that categorizes links for a tools page.  On this page I want to have multiple categories and each tool under those categories.

Negative 58706 pI want to create a Metro app for learning and personal consumption purposes to do all sorts of lowlevel device API work, such as tracking power consumption, enumerating processes and calculating CPU usage per process, etc... Unfortunately, these Desktop APIs are forbidden from Metro applications.p  pMy first attempt to work around this was to create a nonwindows store C library, which has the codeWINAPIFAMILYcode variable set correctly in order to use functions like codeQueryIdleProcessorCycleTimecode and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa37267528vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeCallNtPowerInformationcodea. Unfortunately, it is this latter function call that fails when I pass it the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa37318428vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeProcessorInformationcodea token in the first argument, with a codeSTATUSACCESSDENIEDcode return code.p  pInterestingly, codeCallNtPowerInformationcode works just fine when given codeSystemBatteryStatecode as the first argument, so I imagine there is some kind of access privilege I am missing when running as a Metro app for getting processor info.  I read that Metro apps are run with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12040390howarewinrtmetroappsrestrictionsenforcedquite restricted privilegesa, and so I am looking for a way to increase these privileges to allow my API calls to go through properly.  To test that it is the process privileges and not a coding error, I used the C library from a console application, and everything worked just fine.p  pI would really like to not have to create a second, desktop background process that does all the dirty work and communicates the results to the Metro app over a socket.  I realize this can work, but I would rather have everything housed in the same process space.p

Negative 58706 pI have read many forums and posts now but nothing seems to get exactly what my issue is. I have a footer using WordPress blank theme that is 100 width at the bottom of the page, no worries there. I have 3 divs within an foot div which is inside the  HTML 5 hook. I want that inner div foot to be the same width and stay the same as the wrapper above it, so that it looks to be the same width as the wrapper  960px wide. I am struggling to figure out how to make this happen. You can see my code and css, as I am sure you know how with google chrome or firefox firebug, at a hrefhttpnewsite.dramanotebook.com relnofollowhttpnewsite.dramanotebook.coma. Let me know what you think is the best solution, even if that means having to change up the pagefooter templates to make what I want happen.p  pI wish to have the codeltfootergtcode to be 100 width to expand the width of the users window and the codeltdiv idfootgtcode to be restricted to 960px width.

Negative 58706 pIm trying to get a grip around emLinqem and have the following problemp  pI have a list of a custom object, with a few properties for each object. I then have another list of the same type, where the property values will be different except for an ID property. Now, I want to add the objects that is found in my second list codetempListcode that is not found in my first list codeOrderListcode. After that I try to remove objects in codeOrderListcode that is not found in codetempListcode. p  pThis might seem a bit unnecessary, but the reason is that I need to keep the values of properties in codeOrderListcode if the ID of these are found in the codetempListcode, hence not replace the object in codeOrderListcode with ememptyem properties from codetempListcode.p  pThe code snippet looks like this codeOrderListcode and codetempListcode has already been filled with objects, and its the property emIDem I use as identifierp  precode Add new orders from account to current object OrderList.AddRangetempList.Wherep gt OrderList.Anyp2 gt p2.ID  p.ID   Remove missing orders from our OrderList OrderList.RemoveAllp gt tempList.Anyp2 gt p2.ID  p.ID codepre  pThere is something Im doing wrong since the properties of an object in OrderList gets reset after each of the two lines...p  pMaybe a fresh set of eyes can see what Im doing wrongp
Negative 58706 pI have an codeAsyncControllercode set up to perform longpolling actions. This all works fine, however a colleague has noticed a memory leak on the server that appears to increase with every new connection.p  pIve created a little application to request from this page thousands of times and Im monitoring the memory usage for the IIS process. Each connection increases the memory usage, but doesnt fall all the way back down when the client has disconnected.p  pAfter further investigation, I found that this still happens even when I replace my codeAsyncControllercode with a standard codeControllercode that does nothing but thisp  precodepublic class WaitController  Controller      public JsonResult Memberstring oauthtoken, int serviceid, bool busy  false              return Jsonnew                      ready  false,         , JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet       codepre  pAlthough in this, there is not strongas muchstrong memory usage, the behaviour appears to be exactly the same.p  pIve ran a memory profiler to show the difference between 10,000 connections and there is barely anything there. The most memory is taken up by instances of codeExpiresEntry[]code from codeSystem.Web.Cachingcode or codeSystem.Runtime.Cachingcode, however these total to nothing in comparison to the memory increase Im getting on the IIS worker process.p  pstrongMy question isstrong, is IIS doing this by design Perhaps this had been allocated for connection threads, which are hanging around just incase theyre needed later Is this a bug with IIS, ASP.NET or MVC 4p  pIt was my decision to use MVC 4s WebAPI features for this because we want this to be flexible, maintainable, futureproof and to be accessed via AJAX. It also seemed to make sense from a development point of view, as we have built the website in MVC 4 too.p  pHowever, a colleague has now raised this as a critical problem with the system architecture as we will in the future need thousands of clients connected. He is suggesting we use WCF instead. So, bonus question  will using WCF resolve these problemsp
Negative 58706 pIm writing a client app that connects to a service using the chunked transfer encoding.  The service occasionally disconnects and I was told it was because were sending a zero chunk in the request, so codeTomcatcode closes the connection.  p  pIm using the codeJavacode codeHttpUrlConnectioncode class to make the connection and I have no idea why it would be sending a zero chunk and how to prevent it from doing that.p  pHeres the code.p  precodeURL m5url  new URLhttpshostedconnect.m5net.comboblboblnameorg.m5.apps.v1.cti.ClickToDial.subscribe StringBuffer sb  new StringBufferltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8standaloneyesgt                                      ltCommandgt                                      ltNamegtorg.m5.apps.v1.cti.ClickToDial.subscribeltNamegt                                     ltIdgt1ltIdgt                                      ltUsergt  m5username  ltUsergt                                      ltPasswordgt  m5password  ltPasswordgt                                      ltFormattedXmlgttrueltFormattedXmlgt                                      ltShallowResponsegtFULLltShallowResponsegt                                      ltCommandgt  conn  HttpURLConnection m5url.openConnection conn.setRequestMethodPOST conn.setRequestPropertyContentType, applicationxwwwformurlencoded conn.setReadTimeoutSESSIONTIMEOUT conn.setChunkedStreamingMode0 conn.setDoOutputtrue conn.setDoInputtrue conn.setUseCachesfalse  out  new DataOutputStreamconn.getOutputStream conn.connect out.writeBytessb.toString out.flush codepre  pWhen I do codeinputstream.readlinecode its codenullcode, but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commxbzR.png altenter image description here Ok, so Im thoroughly confused. I abandoned using the HttpURLConnection and started using the Socket class and writing all the headers and data manually.  Without sending the zero chunk it seems to work all the time.  With the zero chunk it seemed to be working all the time except when I ran it in the debugger, where it got the same error as above.  So I put a sleep100 after it sends the headers and before it sends the data and ran it without the debugger and it consistently got the error.  So I assume in the HttpURLConnection class theres a delay after sending the headers which is why it works sometimes and doesnt other times.  I could just not send the zero chunk but Id really like to know why that would cause the error.

The interface only implements 1 method codeLogstring message, Category category, Priority prioritycode.p  pThe codeILoggerFacadecode interfacep  precodepublic interface ILoggerFacade      void Logstring message, Category category, Priority priority  codepre  pMy implementation p  precodepublic class Log4NetLogger  ILoggerFacade      private static readonly ILog mLogger  LogManager.GetLoggertypeofILoggerFacade      public void Logstring message, Category category, Priority priority              switch category                      case Category.Debug                 mLogger.Debugmessage                 break             case Category.Warn                 mLogger.Warnmessage                 break             case Category.Exception                 mLogger.Errormessage                 break             case Category.Info                 mLogger.Infomessage                 break                codepre  pI believe that with newly introduced code[CallerMemberName]code attribute I should be able to get the caller method name passed to the logger if only I knew how to do something like thisp  precodepublic class Log4NetLogger  ILoggerFacade      public void Logstring message, Category category, Priority priority, [CallerMemberName] string callerMethod                 ... codepre  pSo my question, how do I override the codeLogcode method enforced by third party Prism interface to contain 1 additional, optional parameter Or how do I pass the caller method name using this attribute so I can log itp  pI have seen other similar questions but [CallerMemberName] attribute is a new feature in .NET 4.5 so Im hoping for a better solution than the ones presented.p

Negative 58706 pI have a JAVE EE6 project using JPA 2 to persist entities into a MySQL database using Eclipselink 2.4.1 running on Glassfish 3.1.2.2. p  pI am storing the data in two separate databases, and for this I have two JNDI JDBC resources, and two JDBC connection pools.

Negative 58706 pIm using UIScrollview in Xcode 4.6.  I want to insert around 30 images into the scrollview.  Within the storyboard I cant add this many as it doesnt actually let you scroll down on the storyboard to add more images, hence all the images overlap each other.  p  pThe answer is probably quite simple so sorry if this is a dumb question.  How do I add this many images to the scrollview, is there a way to code it like in Android xml  Or is there anyway to not have the images overlapp

Negative 58706 pI am attempting to make a custom hotkey that will go to the previous sheet viewed.p  pAs far as I understand, this would involve making a Class Module as a Worksheet object that will capture Sheet Change, Sheet Activate, and Sheet Deactivate Events.  Once the event has been captured, I would set the previous active worksheet to an object variable.  Then I would make a custom macro that would go to the previously set worksheet object once a hotkey is pressed.  Is this the right pathp  pAnd if it is the right path, where would I save the Macro code so that its usable by all future workbooks  I have a PERSONAL.xlsb file created and ready to edit.  Would I make the class module in PERSONAL.xlsb  How would I initialize the object in PERSONAL.xlsb when I create a new workbookp  pAnswers to these questions would be greatly appreciated, thank youp

Since the code bypasses the Box2D simulation, there is no collision response. Therefore, sprites can overlap.

Negative 58706 pI recently installed windows 8.1 preview as a lastditch effort to solve my problem of Visual Studio 2012 being horribly slow. That made it run 100 faster. Unfortunately, my VS 20102012 extension, which is targeted for .NET 4.0 in order to run on VS 2010 AND 2012, will no longer build on Windows 8.1 preview. Several SDK dlls e.g. Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Data.dll are not available when targeting .NET 4.0. If I switch to .NET 4.5, they become available to reference. Installing VS 2013 preview did not fix the problem. Any ideas on how to solve this issue are much appreciated.p

Negative 58706 pyesterday all of a sudden i started getting typescript compile errors... the error was along the lines ofp  pcould not find file XXXXXXX...p  pthe strange thing is that the file being referred to XXXXXXX in the message has an invalid path due to a charecter being cut off... so for example the correct actual file is cprojectapp.ts but the error message makes reference to cprojecapp.ts... notice the t is missing from project...p  panyway, it turns out that my problem is already documented here a hrefhttptypescript.codeplex.comworkitem597 relnofollowhttptypescript.codeplex.comworkitem597ap  pthis link is somewhat dated... so my question however is whether or not this is still the valid workaround i am using the latest version 0.9.1... this seems like a serious issue that would affect many users with large projects with many TS files... so i suspect by now that this issue has perhaps been fixed and perhaps i am doing something wrong... thank youp

I can use a . wildcard in the find, but obviously not in the replace string.p  pI would use single quotes for the sed command, in order to avoid expanding the 2, but single quotes are already used inside the command.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas of how to overcome this problem  Thanks in advance for any suggestionsp

Negative 58706 pI am currently working on a game where I have a couple of classes which each handles their own gameobjects. For these classes to actually represent something in the game they need to use another class which is the animationmanager.  The animationmanager handles the loading, drawing and moving of objects on the screen and is created at startup. p  pWhat would be the smartest way of passing the manager to the classes which handles the gameobjects p  pShould it be done by a public pointer, by assigning it to a static pointer in the object class which every gameobject inherits from or should I simply just pass it as a pointer to the gameobjectsobjects class constructorp  pI am using C03 so no new fancy fixes Pp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pThere has been a lot of good suggestions and I am thankful for that.

Negative 58706 pI am just starting on a project that will require me to aggregate data from multiple Excel files into Access tables. The tricky part is that my Excel data will not be in tables, but in a minesweeper like mess you know, where the mines are randomly placed.  Of course it is not totally random...p  pEach Excel file is essentially a tracking form for a project containing budgeting information and other data. Being a FORM means that it is arranged visually rather than logically. Additionally, the data stretches across 4 separate worksheets.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions for efficiently getting this data into Accessp  pbAssumptionsbbr 1 Each excel file will only become one row of data in Access. br 2 Each excel file will be locked so that data is entered in the exact same cells each timep  pBased on these assumptions, I was thinking of creating a hidden worksheet with appropriate header values that reference each individual cell, thus creating a consolidated data table. Then from Access I was going to create a macro allowing me to select the desired workbook and import a new record from that hidden table. There is of course plenty of information out there on how to import one or more records from an excel table, so if I have to create a dummy table so be it.p  pAny alternative methods that I should consider though Any tricks that might simplify the steps I outlinedp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 58706 pI have setup a Linux server with Apache and modwsgi. From my Apache configurationp  precodeWSGIDaemonProcess myapp processes1 threads10 codepre  pHere myapp is a Django webapp. When myapp receives a large http POST request from Apache in a Django HttpRequest object, accessing the posted data the fist time takes several seconds of wallclock time. I assume this is because myapp is invoked before the full body of the POST is read from the network and that accessing the posted data in the HttpRequest object blocks until the posted data is read.p  pIs there a way to not have myapp invoked until Apache has read all the posted datap  pI ask because I want to tune the number of threads in this case 10 to what is most optimal for concurrent processing in myapp. Therefore, I do not want to spend time in these requests on just waiting on receiving posted data from the network.p  pI am aware that I could potentially increase the number of threads to more than 10 and implement another mechanism to ensure that at most 10 threads are processing concurrently.p

Negative 58706 pI have an iPad application which I have created using storyboards.  I have created another single viewController which I have created using a separate .xib file.  This viewController I need to call from the main application, and then later dismiss to return back to the main application.  I am able to do this so far.  My problem is that because I am using a Navigation Controller to call this secondary view controller, I am unable to load this view controller in landscape mode.  I am only able to load it in portrait mode.  Based on going through this forum, and from whatever research that I have done, I have learned that I need to subclass the navigation controller, and then that is how I will be able to load this secondary view controller in landscape mode.p  pI have included the following methods in my secondary view controller NextViewController, but it has no effectp  precodeBOOLshouldAutorotate      return YES   NSUIntegersupportedInterfaceOrientations      return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape  codepre  pHere is the code in the calling viewController MainViewController, which calls NextViewController, which in turn is appearing in portrait mode, instead of the desired landscape modep  precode void touchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       nextView  [[NextLandscapeViewController alloc] initWithNibNameNextLandscapeViewController bundlenil]     [nextView setDelegateidself]     UINavigationController navigationController  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllernextView]     [self presentViewControllernavigationController animatedYES completionnil]   codepre  pAs I pointed out, the solution that I need is to subclass the Navigation Controller, but I honestly have never done this before, and nor do I know how to do it.

Negative 58706 pI trying to rewrite simple game developed by me with Cocos2dBox2d sometime ago using Sprite Kit framework. Everything looks much simpler in Sprite Kit, which is great, but I have a problem adjusting physics world parameters in the new project. I have noticed that sprites created using exactly same graphic images all have basic rectbased bodies have four times lower mass in Sprite Kit than it had in Cocos2dBox2d. Setting bodies density to 4 solve the problem, unfortunately thats not the main issue. It looks like the same problem with 4time multiplier works for all forces in the physics world. I have done some testing in Sprite Kit and create a body with mass four time higher than in Cocos2dBox2d, I have also set the world gravity to be four time lower than in Cocos2dBox2d. As a result physic in both projects first using Cocos2dBox2, second using Sprite Kit behaves similarly. I cant find anything like PIXELTOMETERRATIO that was available in Box2 in Sprite Kit. Is there any option that allows to adjust the physics world in Sprite Kit to behave like in Cocos2dBox2d without multiplying all forces, masses etc Maybe there is some kind of configuration property that allows to adjust it. If I leave the same values for gravity, mass and forces in Sprite Kit that I was using in Cocos2dBox2d everything in the game will be simulated too fast. My question is how to deal with problems like this when migrating from Cocos2d with Box2d to Sprite Kit frameworkp

Negative 58706 pIs there an easy way to translate JPA Exceptions to application exceptionsp  pMy Remote Session Bean in a Java EE Container JBoss is called by the client via RMI. The Session Bean gets a JPA Entity Manager injected and is writing something into the database. Transactions are handled by the container JTA. If any exception occurs when writing to the database then this exception is thrown to the client. Since Im using Hibernate Ive got Hibernate Exceptions in the client. The client does not know any Hibernate libs and therefore Im getting ClassNotFoundExceptions in the client. Now I would like to translate the exception in the container and throw an exception that my client can handle.  I had the following ideas but all of them have a drawback I thinkp  ol liAvoid the JPA Exception e.g. by checking constraints before writing to the database. This means to duplicate DB constraints in business logic.li liFlushing the Entity Manager inside the business method and catching and translating any errors that might be raised during flush inside the method. Well, I like the idea that the Persistence Provider postpones any talking to the database as long as possible.li liDisabling Container Managed Transactions and doing transaction management in my own Interceptor. This way I can catch all exceptions that occur before or during commit and wrap them to my application exceptions.li liUse Spring JPA and Springs Exception Translation features. Well Im already in a Java EE Container maybe there is some Java EE way to do Exception Translationli ol

Negative 58706 pI have the following structp  precodetypedef struct     int a     int initvoid  tObj codepre  pI am wrapping this into an object ObjExt in Ruby. Ruby initialization method gets a Proc cb that shall be run anytime init function is called somewhere to generate an integer. p  psomething likep  precodecb  Proc.new  1  rubyobj  ObjExt.newcb codepre  pMy first shot at this was I passed the cb proc to a global VALUE type variable and run rbfuncall on it in a wrapper function  int wrappervoid that I define, and literally assign init  wrapper. but this wont work if I have multiple object instances of ObjExt class as the global variable is shared between instances and gets overwritten when initializing the second and third objects.p  pAny hints would be appreciated. I am probably approaching the problem in a wrong way.p

Negative 58706 pSo, Ive been reading alot about the issues of printing, after a couple of days of research and reading a lot, it all starts making sense. Lets say Ive this piece of code Im using php and phpprinter extensionp  precodeboldon  chr27.E.chr1 boldoff  chr27.E.chr0 pcenter  chr27.a.chr1 pleft  chr27.a.chr0 handle  printeropenGeneric  Text Only File printersetoptionhandle, PRINTERMODE, RAW printerwritehandle, boldon.pcenter.Some text printerwritehandle, n printerwritehandle, Some more text printerwritehandle, n printerclosehandle codepre  pThat works wonderfully when running on localhost, Im using a thermal printer and it prints fine. As Ive come to knownow it makes total sense when I try this on my server, this doesnt work, I think that it is because the actual server tries to print it locally and the printer isnt found, I guess if the printer were installed in the server, the servers printer would print it, but thats not what Im looking for.p  pDisplaying the information in html or any sort and use window.print has no use, as browsers doesnt send text onlyor thats what I read many times and generic text only, prints text onlyIm guessing. p  pSo the solution is making a file of some sort that contains  the text with ESCP and then print it with javascriptI dont need to skip the print dialog as mentioned in other threads, and I cant change the driver, it has to be generic text only. So if I make a .txt file with the information I want, it will print, but the ESCP is ignored, so I cant format my text in anyway, it will print with the default printer options, sending all in plain textthe irony ignoring new lines and every piece of ESCP.p  pSo, the question here is, is there anyway to create a fileany type of file that will send the text that I want and not ignore the ESCPp
Negative 58706 pIm working with the ngStart Angular seed project and Im trying to optimize RequireJS for deployment. When I run the grunt job to build the artifact, I end up with an output file that does not include all of the libraries in my main.js file. Ive spent most of today trying different things to get this to work. If I explicity list every module in my gruntfile something I really dont want to do they all get in there, but seemingly not in the right order as it doesnt work in the browser. I thought that the optimizer was supposed to read the require.config call in my main.js and load everything in the correct order.

While on my 2nd query, Its only when I add the long codeGROUP BYcode clause that the query executes successfully on the SQL Server Management studio, then nothing shows up on my codeGridviewcode. p
Negative 58706 pOkay, so Ive never used the python multiprocessing library, and I dont really know how to word my search. I read the docs for the library, and I have tried searching for examples of my problem and I couldnt find anything.br I have a list of file names 2400, a dictionary called cond, and is a global, and a function. I want to run my function on each processor, and each time the function is running it is using one of the file names as the variable. So I want it to be running 4 processes, 1 for each processor, and it should work its way through the list, when one function ends it carries onto the next item in the list, and each of those functions are going to be updating a single shared dictionary. p  pPsudofunction code  p  precodedef PSCfnom     f  openfnom,r     r  xml.dom.minidom.parsef     cond[fnom]  otherfuncr     f.close codepre  pSo, a is it possible to use multiprocessing on this function, and b if it is, what method from the multiprocessing library would be able to handle it, c if youre extra nice, how do I iterate through a list passing each item as a arg each time.  p  pmusings about the way it would work psudo bulls code  p  precodeif name  main     namelist  namelistfunc     method  multiprocessing.[method] no idea what method     method.somethingtargetPSC, iternamelist no idea either codepre

Negative 58706 pI am attempting to derive a new emacs mode from python.el the current official gnu one for Boo and I am having trouble with altering the indentation. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to best handle this I do not need to change anything drastically, just add some new block forms and stuff. p  pFor example, since this is for Boo, the tryexcept syntax uses ensure instead of finally. I can change this easily enough in python.el by changing the blockstart def of pythonrxconstituents. However, I cant seem to be able to override this in a derived mode because pythonrxconstituents is being then used by a macro, pythonrx, and I guess once those two things are defined when python.el loads as it has to, since I am deriving from it, I can no longer override it afterload or in a hook Because Ive definitely changed it in memory and in a hook after python.el loads and in an afterload statement and none of them work.

Negative 58706 pTrying to figure out a good solution for handling different resolutions and resizing in a 2D sidescrolling shooter game build with OpenTK OpenGL.p  pOrtho is setup as follows.p  precode    private void Setup2DGraphics              const double halfWidth  1920  2         const double halfHeight  1080  2         GL.MatrixModeMatrixMode.Projection         GL.LoadIdentity         GL.OrthohalfWidth, halfWidth, halfHeight, halfHeight, 1.0, 1.0         GL.MatrixModeMatrixMode.Modelview         GL.LoadIdentity      codepre  pOrtho fixes to 19201080 to keep the ortho fixed size.

Example If screensize is 1024768, it resturns 1024576 shrinking height. It then places the ortho higher in the viewport using half of the height difference as offset. This results in black bars above and below the windows.p  pThis setup works. It prevents aspect ratio issues on all resolutions. However Im questioning myself if this is the right way to do it The issues I can think of with this design  On resolutions lower then 19201080, the view is scaled down. This has an effect of how sprites look. For example, text starts to look horrible when scaled down.  If turning down resolution for performance, will this have an effect if the ortho stays the same sizep  pDid a lot of searching on this topic but so far the only things I can find is plain instructions on how to perform actions, rather then to build solutions. I also found out that using Mipmaps might solve my scaling issue. However the question remains, am I on the right track Should I look at the aspect ratio problem from a different anglep

Negative 58706 pI use Geany to edit .C C source files. The sidebar shows me a list of functions in my current file. Some of these functions are written fully with scopes, others are listed just by the name of the function, egp  precodeFoamhexRef4addFace[1441] distribute[5829] codepre  petc. These two functions are both private member functions of the hexRef4 class, within the Foam namespace. They are both declared in a header file, hexRef4.H, which is included at the top of the source file.p  pIf I change the function list from by name to by appearance, then the issue remains, although which functions have the full scope listed change.p  pSome googling highlighted a similar known bug if the function returns a pointer to class object, in which case the function is listed as belonging to the class type it returns a pointer to, but none of the functions I am using return pointers. p  pThis happens both with and without scope for functions with and without return types, before and after constructors in the source file. p  pIf I move the constructors to the top of the source file, then the function list is fully alphabetised but has a group of functions alphabetised by h, for FoamhexRef4functionNameHere.p  pAny suggestionssolutions appreciatedp

Negative 58706 pI have an account to a computing cluster that uses Scientific Linux. Of course I only have user access. Im working with python and I need to run python scripts, so I need to import some python modules. Since I dont have root access, I installed a local python copy on my HOME with all the required modules. When I run the scripts on my account hosting node, they run correctly. But in order to submit jobs to the computing queues to process on much faster machines, I need to submit a bash script that has a line that executes the scripts. The computing cluster uses SunGrid Engine. However when I submit the bash script, I get an error that the modules I installed cant be found I cant figure out what is wrong. I hope if you can help.p

Negative 58706 pI have built an app where in you take pictures and GPS data of that picture is captured for GPS I implemented service and implemented location listener for it. Its working fine but it drains battery so I am planning to change a Lil bit I will start the GPS service when user decides to take pic in my app.. And remove the listener on picture taken. This works fine provided the button to capture is taken after the GPS search is finished else GPS data accuracy is not there. So I have thought to show a dialog fragment to user saying GPS is initializing and ask user to wait. And once GPS location is set the dialog fragment should disappear and user must be able to take picture by the button provided. My problem is how do I capture the event That GPS search is completed .. I am using built in GPS satellite.p
Negative 58706 pIm working on a page for mobile devices and got a sprite as a background Image, which is 13 times higher then the related divContainer. By changing the background Position of this sprite, it looks like an animation. Everything works fine on different iPads Safari, Chrome, Dolphin, Microsoft Surface and the Sony Xperia Tablet Z Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Dolphin, Android Ver. 4.3. p  pIm also testing my page on an Asus Transformer Prime an a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1N Stock browser, Firefox, Dolphin, Chrome, Opera. On this two devices, theres a weird bug in mobile Chrome Ver. 34.0.1847.114 an Opera Ver. 21.0.1437.74904. The Android Version of the Samsung Tab is 4.0.4 and of the Asus is 4.1.1.p  pThe wohle Sprite is compressed on the yaxis. Originally, the sprite is 8879px on the yaxis an 1024px on the xaxis large, which is also the backgroundsize of the Div container. While the sprite is compressed, the change of the backgroundPosition works normaly, till the bottom of the sprite reaches the bottom of the divContainer. Then both browser start stretching the sprite when I want to change the background Position. This happens till the background Position reches the value 7770px, then the image just disappears.p  pHope someone got an idea whats happening here, Im totally confused because of itp

Ill do the same thing I did before again so that I can include those files too, so I go back into the Search directories section and add the directoryp  pCProgram FilesMicrosoft Visual Studio 10.0VCincludep  pbut from there a million different errors appeared, all refereeing to different issues. Can anyone tell me what I did wrong All I wanted to do was use the UI Automation headers so that I can start coding with the library, but that is proving to be a bit difficult...p

Negative 58706 pI need to make a basic calendar display for my website, where it consists of 4x7 rows. Each cell will be a day on the Calendar and have an image representation. Normally I would just use an HTML table for this as its what I am familiar with, but would like to do this correctly and  do it with CSS.p  pI believe I will need 3 DIVs side by side, one to create the empty space on the left, one for empty space on the right and then a content center div for the calendar. What is the best way to create the actual cells for calendar though, where they are the same size and spaced equally apart in a 4x7 gridp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com77rN7.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 58706 p[Edit] Theres also Google Groups thread a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicdurandaljsXTEejGrB4js relnofollowover herea. Ill try to keep both updated as I learn more.p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpdurandaljs.comdocumentationHookingLifecycleCallbacks relnofollowDurandal Documentationa the page Root View Model only implements limited Activator functionality.  Specifically, it states thatp  blockquote   p....p      p4 When you call app.setRoot a limited activator is used on your root module.p      pNote Case 4 is a bit different as it only enforces canActivate and activate callbacks not the deactivation lifecycle. To enable that, you must use a full activator yourself cases 13.p blockquote  pWhich means that unlike all the nested page ViewModels, the root ones do not get a chance to dispose of their junk objects and clean up.p  pWhat is a friendly way to fire both canDeactivate and deactivate on these objects when I call app.setRoot  I could perhaps do this manually, but Id need a reference to the root ViewModel, which isnt necessarily in scope.  p  pIve considered creating an pubsub system of sorts, though Im weary of that because it has the potential to cause MORE memory issues and cleanup complexity than reduce it.p  pIve considered forking the project, though that comes with some heavy overhead as Id have to maintain my fork from then on.p  p[EDIT]p  pExamplep  pLets say I was to start my application and set the shell to the main shell.p  precode  app.start.thenfunction         app.setRootviewsshellsmain    codepre  pAt some time later, I wish to switch to a new shell. Perhaps a different layout, full screen, or a different skin.p  precode app.setRootviewsshellsaccounts codepre  pThis will cause the shell accounts to check andor fire activate and canActivate, but it will NOT check the shell main for a canDeactivate and a deactivate.  I have cleanup logic that I wish to run when these go away. How can I accomplish thisp  p[EDIT]p  pThe portion of the durandal code the handles this is a local function living under the module durandalapp setRoot  finishComposition  It looks like thisp  precode  function finishComposition              ifsettings.model                  if settings.model.canActivate                      try                          var result  settings.model.canActivate                         if result ampamp result.then                              result.thenfunction actualResult                                  if actualResult                                      composition.composehostElement, settings                                                              .failfunction err                                  system.errorerr                                                       else if result                              composition.composehostElement, settings                                               catch er                          system.errorer                                       else                      composition.composehostElement, settings                               else                  composition.composehostElement, settings                       codepre  pPerhaps theres a way to monkey patch this Id like to avoid editing the core of Durandal if possible.  p

Negative 58706 pCurrently, Im using codeNSCachecode to store data for my app. I can always retrieve that data again from the server, so it is not a problem if I eventually lose the data, thats why Im using codeNSCachecode.p  pThe problem is that every time my app enters background codeNSCachecode evicts data. I dont want it to evict data unless it is really necessary for memory improvement or if the object reaches its limits.p  pI dont want to switch to codeNSDictionarycode and get my app killed on the background if it uses too much memory. I could subclass codeNSDictionarycode and make it clear itself when needed or when getting memory warnings, but I guess this would be a lot of work.p  pI read around and found a few suggestions to use codeNSCachecode with codeNSDiscardableContentcode protocol, but didnt really found any sample code of implementation. Im not even sure if this would be the best approach to my case.p  pAny suggestions p  pUPDATEp  pI found a hrefhttpsgithub.comnicklockwoodOSCache relnofollowthis codea in github which gives me the expected result. Therefore, it doesnt use the codeNSDiscardableContentcode and I cannot identify what is going on that it doesnt remove objects in case app enters background state. I guess his method code voidcleanUpcode is called every time codeNSCachecode will remove objects and there he only proceeds if object has reached its limit or received memory warning. p  pAnyway, Im not a fan of using third party codes, so if anyone can help me mimic this behavior would be a great help. p

Negative 58706 pAsked on the grounds of ...but if your question generally covers  a specific programming problem... Help center  askingp  pScope This is not about how to use the file lock mechanisms on different platforms, but about how to mitigate the absence of mandatory file locks on the users system. E.g. I cant expect a user of a Linux system to modify the system, let alone emknowem how to do it, so I have to assume advisory locks is all that is available. I have found a lot of info about how to use locks of both kinds, and what is available on some platforms, and even why they are not available on some systems. Portability would be great, but this is probably to much down to the bone for that.p  pI am a bit confused about how to safeguard my programs data if other processes dont cooperate, intentionally or not. Assuming that my program uses its own directory for the data, is there a way to make sure that my data will stay consistent while the program runsp  pWould, for example, temporary hidden files be a practical solution create a file, delete it from the OS directory, so only my handle holds the inode to the file, copying all data at program start and overwriting the original at the end It seems to be emveryem platform specific, though.p  pAre there specific mechanisms or techniques to use that could help with this, or can I only trustp  pNote This is not specifically about Linux, its just an example.p  p EDIT p  pIm looking for a way to do this that works in CC, hence those tags, but am aware that it might involve system specific features. If possible, the solution would work regardless of platform and file locking mechanism.p  pWhile file locks is the mechanism referenced in the question, the real problem is how to prevent another process from trampling over the data my program relies on emwhile runningem, even if that process runs as the same user as my program does, but does not care to check whether the files are locked. Also if it is using a mechanism that isnt working well with the one my program is using. AFAICT, locks acquired  with one of flocklockf on Linux may not work when the other is used in the other process Another situation from Linux, but one that is outside the scope of the questionp  pAs I tried to explain about the scope, this is not about how to use file locks on any platform, but what to do when you cannot assume anything about what mechanism is availableturned on, to achieve similar protection to what mandatory file locks would give.p

Negative 58706 pI have created a rich text editor. The editor is working as expected, but there is a bug which is annoying me a lot. What I am doing is that, when the user selects a particular word or group of words, I am fetching the start and end cursor positions and then checking whether there are any styles associated with them. If any style is available, then the user may clear that else, the user may apply a style in the words.p  pNow, the problem is that, if the user is continuously writing something with a style format, and later he wants to remove the formatting of one particular word from the list of words, then the formatting is removed from all the words that were written in the same go. But, if the user singularly makes words bold and unbolds them then they are working fine.p  pstrongThe button in the fragmentstrong  p  precodeboldBtn.setOnClickListenernew

Negative 58706 pI am a relative noob at ios programming. p  pI have inherited a project that has a UICollectionView that shows a set of photographs. It is my task to programmatically select some of them say, five of the newest images. By select it is meant to tick the checkbox in the view. p  pI have noticed that manually selecting the images produces in code a call to a function with an argument of type NSIndexPath. I also know I can call a function and pass it an NSIndexPath to select an image. p  pMy problem lies it getting the index path. I am able to iterate the ALAssets containing the images from the Asset Library, and to find the five that I need. p  pHow do I start with the ALAsset, and get the NSIndexPathp

Negative 58706 pWe had a licensing issue when we created our project.  Under the Team Rooms section, it said something about rooms not being available at our licensing level.  We fixed the licensing, and now it just says You do not have any team rooms. A default room is created for each project..  I cannot figure out how to create a room for this project.  If I create a new project and new team, it creates a default team room. I can also create additional rooms for that project.p  pHow can I add a room to a project that was created before the licensing changep  pstrongeditstrong To clarify, I guess rooms are kind of separate from projects and teams.    The problem is, the Team Rooms section on the project and team home page in question does not show a link to the room.  Any new teams or team projects created do show links to rooms.p

Negative 58706 pIm testing a local HTTPS in fact SSL server with a fake test certificate and after adding an exception in Firefox 33.0  Ubuntu I can see the certificate strongisstrong the test certificate Ive created, every time I try to emopenem the test url on my computer on port em4431em, what happens is that Firefox redirects me to another url a hrefhttpwww.kataweb.it relnofollowhttpwww.kataweb.ita.p  pI am completely clueless at this point, because from the logs of my application I can see Firefox forcefully closing the TCPIP connection to localhost and then doing what it wants, strongeven if Ive got the right certificate exceptionstrong.p  pOf course, other browsers such as Chromium, do behave as expected those work just fine, they just display the strikethrough emhttpsem symbol.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Or is Firefox wrongbr The local test server is written in C using openssl Ubuntu 14.04 x64.p  pCheers, p

Negative 58706 pAnother quick question....Im trying to use a foreach statement to get user form inputs inserted into my database and Im getting some weird results.  The foreach loop appears to be parsing out the selections from the dropdown menus and inserting one letter at a time row by row into the database table.  However, it is not parsing the text the user enters into the text boxes.  So theoretically the script would append the form data into the table so it would look like thisp  pFolder Name  Office Code  username  day  month  year  creator  Office Chief  Status  File Series  classification  Media Folder 1         XATC         smithbw     11      Nov     2014    Bob Row     Lee Hall        Draft    10001 Data      Top Secret      CDDVDp  pInstead its placing the first letter of each user input into the cell of the table.  Only the Folder Name entry is being fully and properly inserted into the table cell.p  pSo I guess I have a couple of questions.  In my index.php file do I need to put [] by each of the variable names  Right now I only have it for the checkbox and file name variables. Then in my php script that actually inserts the data Im fairly certain my foreach statement is screwed up.  BXNAMEFolder Name will be the unique identifiers for each line the user enters.  Any pointers are welcome and thanks in advancep  pindex.phpp  precodeltphp sessionstart ifissetSESSION[myusername]  headerLocationindex.php   echo SESSION[myusername] echo lta

Negative 58706 pI have come across something strange when writing unittests where I want to test that object can really be garbage collected cause all events are clean up properly.p  pTo have a minimal example I created a console project in visualstudio 2013 Target Framework 4.5.1 with the following codep  precodeusing System  namespace GarbageCollectionFinalizerForLoop      class TestObj              TestObj                      Program.DestructorWasCalled  true                    class Program              public static bool DestructorWasCalled  false          static void Mainstring[] args                      object myTestObj  new TestObj              myTestObj  new object              GC.Collect             GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers             GC.WaitForFullGCComplete             GC.Collect              for int i  0 i lt 1 i                                         Console.WriteLineFinalizer was called   DestructorWasCalled             Console.ReadLine                  codepre  pIt turns that the finalizer of the TestObj is not called when there is this useless forloop. When the forloop is commented out the destructor is called. So the forloop seems to prevent that the garbage collector can collect this instance of TestObj. Multiple test yield the same result and this behavior seem 100 deterministic.p  pThen I switched the Target Framework to 3.5 and all of a sudden it worked as expected the destructor function got called. Then I changed the Target Framework back to 4.5.1 and it still worked.p  pI was puzzled and tried project cleanrebuilddeleting file but I could not get back the old behavior. But when I created again a new project with the identical code I get back the buggy behavior... So it seems that switching to Target Framework 3.5 made the code run as expected even if you later switch back to 4.5.1. This is really strange to me.p  pI tried some more things in parentheses the console outputp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 4.5 FALSE, switch to 4.5.1 FALSEp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 4 TRUE, switch to 4.5.1 TRUEp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 3.5 TRUE, switch to 4.5.1 TRUEp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 3 TRUE, switch to 4.5.1 TRUEp  pcreate project with 4.5.1 FALSE, switch to 2 TRUE, switch to 4.5.1 TRUEp  pSomething strange is happening here.

Negative 58706 pIve been reading through and Im a bit confused about storing passwords and how people can crack them. The safest way seems to be a very confusing topic for me. I started using md5 and after reading how outdated it is I started using the phphash function like sop  precodehash  passwordhashplainTextPassword, PASSWORDDEFAULT codepre  pIve been told to hash it again using salt and I understand how to do it.

Negative 58706 pI am trying to enable users to buy books using Apples autorenewable inapp purchases. I keep a copy of the subscriptions on my server so that the user can access hisher books across multiple devices and via the web.p  pI am trying to figure out how to keep the subscriptions on my server uptodate when they are autorenewed by Apple. I was thinking of having a cron job run once an hour that would run a PHP script. This script would select the subscriptions that are going to expire within the next hour from my database and check the subscription receipts with Apple to see if they have been autorenewed i.e. there is updated information in the codelatestreceiptinfocode field of the returned information. I can then update the database with information about the autorenewed subscriptions. If I cant find any new information about autorenewal in Apples response dictionary, the subscription will simply be left to expire.p  pstrongWill all subscriptions always be autorenewed at least an hour before they expire will I miss any Is it possible for a subscription to autorenew after it has expired or will the user have to purchase a new subscription Is there any flaw in my thinkingstrongp

Negative 58706 pIm sure this is easy to do, Im just new to this level of PHP programming. Also, please forgive my terminology, I dont know the official names for things, so let me know if somethings not clear.p  pAlright, so Im building a calendar in PHP, and Ive got everything almost working, except I can only display one event per day. I realized this is because Im storing the event data as subkeys for a specific key in an array.p  pEssentially Im creating each day in the calendar as key in the array. For examplep  precodeevents[1]  first day of the month events[2]  second day of the month events[3]  third day of the month ... codepre  pAnd then inside of each of those, Im doing something like thisp  precodeevents[1][title]  title for the event on the first day of the month events[1][time]   time for the event on the first day of the month events[2][title]  title for the event on the second day of the month events[2][time]   time for the event on the second day of the month ... codepre  pThis setup means I can only store one event per day. If I where to try to set up multiple events, each subsequent event would overwrite the values from the previous.p  pSo what I want to do is set up each event as an array within that key. For examplep  precodeevents[1][0]  arraytitle gt first title for the event on the first day of the month, time gt first time for the event on the first day of the month events[1][1]  arraytitle gt second title for the event on the first day of the month, time gt second time for the event on the first day of the month codepre  pI could use codearraypushcode to add each event, but Im not sure how to do that for an array with keys.p  pFinally, once I have this all stored properly, I need to output each event somehow, so how would I cycle through each subarray of each day Right now Im just doing p  precodeforeach events as event      if event[title]            echo ltstronggt . event[title] . ltstronggt       codepre  pI imagine I would need a codeforeachcode inside the codeforeachcode, but Im not quite sure how to set that up.p  pThanks for the help. Again, Im sure this is simple to figure out, Im just not much of a programmer.p  pPS This is all being built for a WordPress site, if that makes a difference. I know theres a hrefhttpwordpress.stackexchange.comhttpwordpress.stackexchange.coma, but I think because this is more general programming questions than anything specific to WordPress that this it the more appropriate site.p

Negative 58706 pMy friend asked me this question, and I didnt quite know how to solve it.p  pIt goes like In a space where only insertions can take place, no deletions, make a data structure that keeps track of processes PCBsTCBs in an infinite number of computers. All the processes must be visible to everyone, and whenever a process forks out a child, it must refer to itself, since it is COW. When some child changes a field, it must get its own copy with the updated field. When 2 or more children make modifications so that their PCBsTCBs are the same, it must both point to the same entity. When someone changes a field, both must get a separate copy.p  pWhat kind of data structure would be efficient for this kind of usagep

So far I have not encountered a build scenario that IntelliJ Idea couldnt handle.

Negative 58706 pNow I know this question exists on stack overflow but not in the way I plan to use it. p  pIm an IOS developer and I love being able to share internet from my phone to my iPad and Mac for when I travel. If i pay the extra 20 a month through strongATampTstrong for tethering I will lose my unlimited data.p  pOne of the popular answers or raised concerns is that apple will not accept an app that enables tethering. Well the thing is I would just like tethering on my iDevice and if it works out I would post the project to github so other developers can enjoy the benefits of nonjailbroken tethering. Also I would not try to publish it to the app store, i know it would get rejected.p  pSo my question is how do I write a tethering app, not like iProxy, but more like MyWi or TetherMe. br  Im pretty sure its possible because apps similar to that have slipped through apples reviewal process before.p

Negative 58706 pObject oriented programming languages e.g. java, c, ... support object typecasting.

There is no reason why you cant create base class by calling derived class constructor.p  pI also came across this link a hrefhttpwww.volantec.bizcastingObjects.htm relnofollowhttpwww.volantec.bizcastingObjects.htma which explains how object typecasting works internally. So far, ok.p  pBut why the first example doesnt use codeHttpURLConnection con  new HttpURLConnectionurl addresscode I know a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavanetHttpURLConnection.html relnofollowHttpURLConnectiona is an abstract class. It just seems more clear, more simple. On the other hand when you are dealing with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5961450whatisinterfacecastingforinc2037423020374230interfaces, object typecasting comes in handya. Another example is codeListltObjectgtcode list, which I see sometimes in some classes. It means that you can save every possible class in this list. Afterwards you can just cast it to its original, if you know what type it is. Wouldnt it be more clear to save only specific classes to list i.e. codeListltStringgtcode, codeListltMyClassgtcode. Is using codeListltObjectgtcode good design practise then at allp

Negative 58706 pIve been looking at some old, Reflector decompiled source code that I dug up. The DLL was originally compiled from Visual Basic .NET source, using .NET 2.0  apart from that I have no information about the compiler anymore.p  pAt some point something strange happened. There was a branch in the code that wasnt followed, even though the condition should have holded. To be exact, this was the branchp  precode[...] if item.Found gt 0      [...] codepre  pNow, the interesting part was that if item.Found was code1code, the scope of the codeifcode statement was entered. The type of codeitem.Foundcode was codeintcode.p  pTo figure out what was going on, I went looking in the IL code and found thisp  precodeldloc.3  ldfld int32 InfoFound ldc.i4.0  cgt.un stloc.s flag3 ldloc.s flag3 brfalse.s L0024 codepre  pObviously Reflector was wrong here. The correct decompiled code should have beenp  precodeif uintitem.Found gt uint0   ...  codepre  pOK so far for context. Now for my question.p  pFirst off, I cannot imagine someone actually writing this code IMO noone with a sane mind makes the distinction between 1 and 0 this way  which are the only two values that Found can have.p  pSo, that leaves me with the conclusion that the compiler does something I do not understand. p  ul liWhy on earth  in what context would a compiler generate IL code like this Whats the benefit of this check instead of codeceqcode or codebneuncode  which is what I would have expected and is normally generated by Cli liAnd related what was the original source code most likelyli ul

When it reaches the end of a row it moves down one row and back to the first column. If no values work at an index then reset current index to code.code and move index back one and continue counting towards code9code. i.e. if current value at index code0,0code is code2code then continue to code3code. If code3code works then move forward one index so on and so forth until the board has been filled. For the simplistic answer it tries every value, code19code, at every empty indexp blockquote  pIf thats unclear then let me knowp  pAlso here is the board that I am usingp  precode..6 ..7 3.. .18 ..9 .5. 5.. ... .64  92. .8. ... ... 763 ... ... .9. .75  63. ... ..8 .9. 3.. 52. ..2 4.. 6.. codepre

I tried out jpathwatch which didnt really seem to cover the scenarios i needed so i try to get unique object identifiers thus being able to track these events myself. p  pThe problem i have is that i tried implement BYHANDLEFILEINFORMATION using JNA and it worked fine for files. But i get null return and error 6 when i try to access directories this way. So what im trying to ascertain is the best way to get a trackable id for both files and folders. If ive made some error, i have som issue locally or with eclipse, or if i perhaps need to look elsewhere for this information.p  pMy testcode is as follows p  precodeOverride public String getUniqueFileIdPath file      BYHANDLEFILEINFORMATION nfo  new BYHANDLEFILEINFORMATION     HANDLE handle  com.sun.jna.platform.win32.Kernel32.INSTANCE.CreateFilefile.toString, 0x80000000, 0x00000001, null, 3, 0x80, null     ifKernel32.INSTANCE.GetLastError  0          LOGGER.errorError occured for   file.toString   Error   Kernel32.INSTANCE.GetLastError            Kernel32.INSTANCE.GetFileInformationByHandlehandle, nfo     ifKernel32.INSTANCE.GetLastError  0          LOGGER.errorError occured for   file.toString   Error   Kernel32.INSTANCE.GetLastError            String identifier  nfo.nFileIndexHigh  nfo.nFileIndexLow.toString  Integer.toHexStringnfo.dwVolumeSerialNumber.intValue     com.sun.jna.platform.win32.Kernel32.INSTANCE.CloseHandlehandle      return identifier  codepre  pAndp  precodepublic interface Kernel32 extends StdCallLibrary  final static MapltString, Objectgt WIN32APIOPTIONS  new HashMapltString, Objectgt      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L              putLibrary.OPTIONFUNCTIONMAPPER, W32APIFunctionMapper.UNICODE         putLibrary.OPTIONTYPEMAPPER, W32APITypeMapper.UNICODE        public Kernel32 INSTANCE  Kernel32 Native.loadLibraryKernel32, Kernel32.class, WIN32APIOPTIONS  public int GetLastError  public class BYHANDLEFILEINFORMATION extends Structure      public DWORD    dwFileAttributes     public FILETIME ftCreationTime     public FILETIME ftLastAccessTime     public FILETIME ftLastWriteTime     public DWORD    dwVolumeSerialNumber     public DWORD    nFileSizeHigh     public DWORD    nFileSizeLow     public DWORD    nNumberOfLinks     public DWORD    nFileIndexHigh     public DWORD    nFileIndexLow      public ListltStringgt getFieldOrder          return Arrays.asListnew String[]               dwFileAttributes,              ftCreationTime,              ftLastAccessTime,              ftLastWriteTime,             dwVolumeSerialNumber,             nFileSizeHigh,             nFileSizeLow,             nNumberOfLinks,             nFileIndexHigh,             nFileIndexLow                    boolean GetFileInformationByHandleHANDLE hFile, BYHANDLEFILEINFORMATION lpFileInformation codepre  pp  pIf someone spots any problem or could give me a push in the right direction i would be greatful.p  pIm using Wondows 10  Eclipse but had same issue on Windows 8.p  pUPDATE realized i called the getlasterror to late, but updated the code and it gives med first error 5, then error 6.

Negative 58706 pAs a part of my Selenium WebDriver test I need to Drag some codeHTMLcode element, Move it to some location and Drop release it there.br I tried the following codesbr 1 Using the codeActioncode    p  precode     Action rotateText  builder.clickAndHoldtextRotator                .moveByOffsetxRotatorOffset, yRotatorOffset                .releasetextRotator                .build        rotateText.perform   codepre  pcodetextRotatorcodeis the element Im trying to drag and move.br In the case of code as it appears here the element is moved to desired position but is instantly got back to the original position when codereleasecode action applied.br If I omit the code.releasetextRotatorcodepart   the element is leaved on desired location but it is not released, each mouse movement affects the element location and brings it to absolutely unwanted location.br 2 With coderobotcode p  precoderobot.mouseMovetextRotatorPoint  The element I want to drag and move   robot.mousePressInputEvent.BUTTON1MASK   robot.mouseMovexTextOffset,yTextOffset   the new location I want to move the element to   robot.mouseReleaseInputEvent.BUTTON1MASK   codepre  pIn this case mouse is thrown to some strange location, near the upperleft corner of the web page, out of the frame Im working with area.br The desired element is not moved to any place...br strongUpdatestrong In the meantime I found some workaround for the first code by adding the code.clickcode. Now it looks  p  precode     Action rotateText  builder.clickAndHoldtextRotator                .moveByOffsetxRotatorOffset, yRotatorOffset                .click                              .releasetextRotator                .build        rotateText.perform   codepre  pAnd it works.

Negative 58706 pIm going on 8 hours straight. Im working on just the first button alone, trying to manipulate the JLabel and also add an X on the JButton after its clicked. I chose a 2D array loop instead of hard coding each button to save lines of code.

constructor as well.p  pheres the errorp  precodeException in thread AWTEventQueue0 java.lang.NullPointerException     at TicTacToeGame.actionPerformedTicTacToeGame.java59     at

Negative 58706 pIm trying to setup CloudFront over S3, and Ive run into the following problem.p  pIm requesting images and text files across domains.

And if I request the same asset after that, not including the codeOrigincode header, it responds correctly with no codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode header.  strongBUTstrong... if I make another request via XHR including the codeOrigincode header to the same URL, it returns an incorrect response strongWITHOUTstrong the codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode for ever more.p  pI have CloudFront setup with whitelisted codeOrigincode headers, and not caching codeOPTIONScode.p  pMy S3 CORS policyp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltCORSConfiguration xmlnshttps3.amazonaws.comdoc20060301gt     ltCORSRulegt         ltAllowedOrigingtltAllowedOrigingt         ltAllowedMethodgtGETltAllowedMethodgt         ltMaxAgeSecondsgt60ltMaxAgeSecondsgt         ltAllowedHeadergtltAllowedHeadergt     ltCORSRulegt ltCORSConfigurationgt codepre  pAnd here is a cURL examplep  pstrongMake a request via XHRstrongp  precode curl httpxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.nettesttest03.txt H Origin httpwww.cnn.com H AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate, sdch H AcceptLanguage enGB,enq0.8,enUSq0.6,enNZq0.4,zhTWq0.2,zhq0.2,enAUq0.2 H UserAgent Mozilla5.0 iPad CPU OS 70 like Mac OS X AppleWebKit537.51.1 KHTML, like Gecko Version7.0 Mobile11A465 Safari9537.53 H Accept  H Referer httpwww.cnn.com H ProxyConnection keepalive compressed  HTTP1.1 200 OK ContentType textplain Date Sat, 22 Aug 2015 084256 GMT AccessControlAllowOrigin  AccessControlAllowMethods GET AccessControlMaxAge 60 LastModified Sat, 22 Aug 2015 084108 GMT ETag 0cbc6611f5540bd0809a388dc95a615b AcceptRanges bytes Server AmazonS3 Vary Origin XCache Miss from cloudfront Via 1.1 8d45ffe3c8bfd31eef4b048ab3ea99b2.cloudfront.net CloudFront XAmzCfId lY4reBVHrFq3MVgdFLx4LvbaOj8UnypXIHxBRvUN4TkkXzyHVmQcmQ ContentLength 4 Connection KeepAlive codepre  pstrongRepeat the request Note the cache hitstrongp  precode curl httpxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.nettesttest03.txt H Origin httpwww.cnn.com H AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate, sdch H AcceptLanguage enGB,enq0.8,enUSq0.6,enNZq0.4,zhTWq0.2,zhq0.2,enAUq0.2 H UserAgent Mozilla5.0 iPad CPU OS 70 like Mac OS X AppleWebKit537.51.1 KHTML, like Gecko Version7.0 Mobile11A465 Safari9537.53 H Accept  H Referer httpwww.cnn.com H ProxyConnection keepalive compressed  HTTP1.1 200 OK ContentType textplain Date Sat, 22 Aug 2015 084256 GMT AccessControlAllowOrigin  AccessControlAllowMethods GET AccessControlMaxAge 60 LastModified Sat, 22 Aug 2015 084108 GMT ETag 0cbc6611f5540bd0809a388dc95a615b AcceptRanges bytes Server AmazonS3 Age 6 Vary Origin XCache Hit from cloudfront Via 1.1 90d8e168b0948a3eb36a451ebb27f4f9.cloudfront.net CloudFront XAmzCfId cUTCt5MsdLUrUqQk7HLCUVyNEWOWW2ET19Pc6j4M8LkfsyQ ContentLength 4 Connection KeepAlive codepre  pstrongMake request WITHOUT codeOrigincode headerstrongp  precode curl httpxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.nettesttest03.txt H AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate, sdch H AcceptLanguage enGB,enq0.8,enUSq0.6,enNZq0.4,zhTWq0.2,zhq0.2,enAUq0.2 H UserAgent Mozilla5.0 iPad CPU OS 70 like Mac OS X AppleWebKit537.51.1 KHTML, like Gecko Version7.0 Mobile11A465 Safari9537.53 H Accept  H Referer httpwww.cnn.com H ProxyConnection keepalive compressed  HTTP1.1 200 OK ContentType textplain Date Sat, 22 Aug 2015 084318 GMT LastModified Sat, 22 Aug 2015 084108 GMT ETag 0cbc6611f5540bd0809a388dc95a615b AcceptRanges bytes Server AmazonS3 XCache Miss from cloudfront Via 1.1 bd9375a232718e4567ed228bf8c06fc9.cloudfront.net CloudFront XAmzCfId 03bYSXai6AmwmPRHukm3g8Qv09qBKdyYs5sXb5RLtPuPdYQHD35hA ContentLength 4 Connection KeepAlive Age 0 codepre  pstrongRepeat request WITHOUT codeOrigincode headerstrongp  precode curl httpxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.nettesttest03.txt H AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate, sdch H AcceptLanguage enGB,enq0.8,enUSq0.6,enNZq0.4,zhTWq0.2,zhq0.2,enAUq0.2 H UserAgent Mozilla5.0 iPad CPU OS 70 like Mac OS X AppleWebKit537.51.1 KHTML, like Gecko Version7.0 Mobile11A465 Safari9537.53 H Accept  H Referer httpwww.cnn.com H ProxyConnection keepalive compressed  HTTP1.1 200 OK ContentType textplain Date Sat, 22 Aug 2015 084318 GMT LastModified Sat, 22 Aug 2015 084108 GMT ETag 0cbc6611f5540bd0809a388dc95a615b AcceptRanges bytes Server AmazonS3 XCache Miss from cloudfront Via 1.1 bd9375a232718e4567ed228bf8c06fc9.cloudfront.net CloudFront XAmzCfId 03bYSXai6AmwmPRHukm3g8Qv09qBKdyYs5sXb5RLtPuPdYQHD35hA ContentLength 4 Connection KeepAlive Age 3 codepre  pstrongMake request WITH codeOrigincode header.

Negative 58706 pIm working with the data generated with the sensor accelerometer. I save every sensor event in sqllite.

Negative 58706 pIt is hard to find a title for this problem, so let me describe the issue. I have a list of strictly monotonic increasing float values with 0 and 1 being upper and lower boundary, respectively. Further there is a value, and I want to find out between which two values the actual value is.p  pConsider the following examplep  precodeli  [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1.0] codepre  pI need a function which basically returns an index of the matching pair. If the value is between 0 and 0.1 to be exact 0 lt val lt 0.1, it should return 0. Examplesp  precodegetindexli, 0.3  3 getindexli, 0.05  0 getindexli, 0.9  6 codepre  pMy current approach would be to iterate over the list, store the last and current item and use a counter. Basically like thisp  precodedef getindexli, val     counter  0     oldval  None     newval  None     for item in li         if newval is None             newval  item                 continue             oldval  newval             newval  item             if oldval lt val and val lt newval                 return counter         counter  1 codepre  pI feel however there must be an easier way.

Negative 58706 pI am new to web service developing. I am experimenting on creating a backend for an app which by the way is a Windows 10 Universal App. What I am trying to do is very simple I want my app to ask the service to do something, after which the service runs some code and returns something. In other words I want to call a method defined in the service, from my app. p  pI have found tons of guides on this but they all date back to the early 2000s and use technologies that are now deemed obsolete. p  pstrongWhat I managed to do so farstrongp  pI created a new Web Site FileNewNew Web Site using the WCF service template Visual C, .Net framework 4, added a Web service ASMX to it right click on projectAddAdd New ItemWeb Service ASMX , then I added some webmethods to the .cs file associated to the webservice.p  precode[WebMethod] public void MyVoidFunction  Do something  codepre  pThen, in my app, I added a service reference to the webservice right click on references  Add service reference  insert the localhost address up to .asmx  click Go  assign a namespace  click ok.
