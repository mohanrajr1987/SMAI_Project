Then, set that Bitmap as the source of the ImageView.p  pThere is Something about that process that Im just not grokking, though.  The following is the code I tried to use to update the widget.

Negative 7003 ul lia standard case  you have a controller codeControllercode with codeScopesessioncode.li liclasses put in the session usually are expected to implement codeSerializablecode so that they can be stored physically in case the server is restarted, for exampleli liIf the controller implements codeSerializablecode, this means all services other spring beans it is referring will also be serialized. They are often proxies, with references to transaction mangers, entity manager factories, etc.li liIt is not unlikely that some service, or even controller, hold a reference to the codeApplicationContextcode, by implementing codeApplicationContextAwarecode, so this can effectively mean that the whole context is serialized. And given that it holds many connections  i.e. things that are not serializable by idea, it will be restored in corrupt state.li ul  pSo far Ive mostly ignored these issues. Recently I thought of declaring all my spring dependencies codetransientcode and getting them back in codereadResolvecode by the static utility classes codeWebApplicationContextUtilscode and such that hold the requestServletContext in a codeThreadLocalcode. This is tedious, but it guarantees that, when the object is deserialized, its dependencies will be up to date with the emcurrentem application context.p  pIs there any accepted practice for this, or any guidelines for serializing parts of the spring context.p  pNote that in JSF, managed beans controllers are stateful unlike actionbased web frameworks. So perhaps my question stands more for JSF, than for springmvc.p

Negative 7003 pIm trying to use NHibernate in a project. All my domain tables include a CreatedBy field which is a foreign key to the Users table. Since this is an ASP.NET app, the only information I have about the user at the time of saving is the username, from the cookie.p  pWhat is the best approach for obtaining the user ID and saving it into the domain tables CreatedBy fieldp  pFor example, it would be simple to write code in the app to load the user up from the username, and stick its UserId property into the CreatedBy property of the domain object before saving it. However, this would be clumsy I would have to remember to do all this whenever persisting a newlycreated domain object and would also involve two hits to the database, which I would rather avoid.p  pWhat is the simplest and most elegant way to do thisp  pThanksp  pDavidp
Negative 7003 pAs part of my endless NHibernateinspired DAL refactoring purgatory, I have started to use the Repository pattern to keep NHibernate at arms length from my UI layer.

When you access the proxys properties, you get the exception because you are ro longer within the scope of the ISession. I laughed out loud when I realised what was happening.p  pI have fixed this withp  precodepublic StoredWill Loadint id    StoredWill storedWill   using ISession session  NHibernateSessionFactory.OpenSession        storedWill  session.LoadltStoredWillgtid     string iReallyCouldntCareLess  storedWill.TestatorLastName      return storedWill  codepre  pBut it all seems a little emsillyem.

Negative 7003 pIn my project I am using a hrefhttpwww.sharedcache.comcms relnofollow titleSharedCacheSharedCachea as a distributed caching mechanism.

I would like to know if there is any way we can synchronize the access to the data between two or more services p  pTo give you an example here is a scenario, imagine there are 2 instances of a service running. Both the instances are accessing the shared cache. If one service picks up some data from the cache for processing I would want the other service to not pick the same information.

I pass the text into the webview and construct a basic HTML wrapper around it and everything is hunkydory. This is the same approach that Twitter for iPhone aka Tweetie uses.p  pThe only problem I have now is that if the text is too long, the webview clips the overflow and scrolls to view the clipped text. Secondly if the text is too short, then there is a big area of wasted space below the webview.p  pUnlike Tweetie, I have more content beneath the webview, and I want to avoid the scrolling overflow or the wasted space. The webview is a subview of a scroll view anyway so the content of the entire page can grow without its subviews needing to scroll.p  pIs there any way I can dynamically resize the webview so that its just the right height based on its contentp  pIve tried many things so far, nothing seems to be a solid solutionp  ul licodesizeToFitcode does nothing or more likely, just sets the size to what the current frame is anyway.li licodesizeThatFitscode returns its current size anyway.li licodeNSStringcodes codesizeWithFontconstrainedToSizecode isnt feasible because codeUIWebViewcode and codeUIFontcode have different representations of what size 18 is. ul liJust to elaborate on this point.

If anyone can explain that me Id be grateful.li ulli liAlso, in the webView Im using the CSS property codewordwrap breakwordcode in order to prevent the webView from scrolling horizontally with long words or URLs. Because of this, the wrapping behaviour between the webView and codeUILineBreakModeWordWrapcode differ completely.

Neither tags nor authors are getting inserted into their respective tables. Their insert statement is wrapped in a conditional thats supposed to be making sure they dont already exist, but it seems to be failing and the insert never happens.

Negative 7003 pSome time ago, me and my friend started working on a Flex project... Now its almost finished, we are working on protection my friend implemented a sort of encryption in the swf, so all the decompilers weve tried read the file as a flash app, and not flex, so its not possible to get the original sources etc... But oh, yes, there is a but... The decompilers weve tried Trilli, Sothink etc have some special features one of these is that they automatically can check if swfs were made in flex or in flash so our encrypted files always seems written in flash...  But we would also like to check if this sort of protection works on manual decompilers manually set flash or flex decompiling, so some of you maybe know some decompilers that can force parsing in flex, or maybe some onlyflex decompilers Thanks in advancep

I was under the impression that navigation and tab bar controllers would rotate if their view controllers respond to rotating.p  pWhy wont my view controllers rotatep  pThe only way Ive been able to get them to rotate is by subclassing codeUINavigationControllercode and overriding its codeshouldAutorotatecode method, but this feels unnecessary to me and I was wondering if theres something Ive missed to make this work.p  h2Edith2  pAccording to the User Experience Coding Howtop  blockquote   pIf you are also using a toolbar, the view controller for each toolbar item must implement the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation method and return YES for each of the orientations you wish to support. If you have a navigation controller for a toolbar item, the root view controller of that navigation controller must implement the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation method and return YES.p blockquote  pIt says toolbar  but I think this is a typo and is probably supposed to be tab bar.p  pSo it seems that Im implementing this correctly, yet my controllers still do not auto rotate.p

Negative 7003 pI have a Windows Form app that creates a window and monitors for entries in a SQL queue. When something shows up, it spawns a thread that opens another Form that launches another thread to do work that contains an ActiveX control. Once the control is done with its work, I remove it from the form, dispose of it, and call the garbage collector. Then I call codeClosecode using a delegate because its in a thread.br Heres where the problem starts. On my dev box, everything works the childform goes away and Im left with the main form I started with. However, when I try running it on a Windows 2003 Server box, it doesnt work. The childform does not go away. It freezes. I can move it around, but trying to close it brings up the End Now dialog the main form also freezes, and shows Not Responding if I click a button.br I tried logging in the codeChildFormFormClosedcode and I can see the entry in the event log, so its getting stuck somewhere between when it thinks its closed and when it actually is closed...p  pWhat might be the cause of thisbr I thought it might be that the ActiveX control is not installed correctly on the machine, but that part of the app works, and it doesnt freeze until after the control is already disposed of.p

Negative 7003 pIve got a project using Spring IoC for dependency injection, and Im trying to slightly simplify my model by having one central location for accessing most of my beans. p  pIm running into a problem using the codePostConstructcode mechanism, or alternatively when implementing the codeInitializingBeancode interface. While all the dependencies in that particular bean may have been resolved, the dependencies in injected beans may not have been.

If I inject object A directly into class C I get no errors.p  pIs there a mechanism I can use to ensure that all beans have been completely instantiated before my codeafterPropertiesSetcode method  any method annotated with codePostConstructcode is calledp  pThanks,p  pJoseph.p

Negative 7003 pstrongSHORT VERSIONstrongp  pWhats the best way to use reflection to turn something like codestring prop  part1.firstnamecode into a codeSystem.Reflection.PropertyInfocode, so that I can use the GetValue and SetValue functionsp  pstrongLONG VERSIONstrongp  pIm using ASP .NET MVC to build a questionnaire for my organization. Its very long, so its divided into several different pages. Since its not uncommon for us to get requests like, Can you move this question to that page, and this other question to another page, I need to build this to be pretty flexible for a junior programmer to change.p  pMy model is a complex class its got five member classes that have mostly primitivetyped properties on them.p  pSo, I access it by doing things like codeModel.part1.firstnamecode or codeModel.part2.birthdatecode.p  pSince the same model is used on all of the pages, but not all of the questions are on every page, I have ActionAttributes that essentially clear out all of the properties that were submitted on the form emexceptem for the ones that were displayed on that page so someone cant inject a hidden field into the form and have the value persist to the database.p  pI want to make sure that I only save valid field values and dont let the user proceed to the next page until the current one is entirely OK, but I also want to save the values that emareem valid, even if the user isnt allowed to proceed.p  pTo do this, I have a function that takes two instances of my model class, a reference to the ModelStateDictionary, and a codestring[]code of field names like part1.firstname and part2.birthdate. That function needs to copy all of the values listed in the string array that do not have validation errors from the first ie, formsubmitted object into the second ie, loaded from the db object.p  pAs stated above, whats the best way to use reflection to turn something like part1.firstname into a codeSystem.Reflection.PropertyInfocode, OR, is there a better way to accomplish thisp

Negative 7003 pI have an SSIS 2008 Package that imports some data and then writes out a text file to a local folder on the computer.  Everything built, deployed and installed fine, and in my XML configuration file I have a property to set the location of the local folder.  I also use an operating system Environment Variable to redirect the location of the XML Configuration file at run time.  On my development machine I set the dropoff folder location to CTemp, but on the target computer I want this dropoff folder set to ESSISFileDropOff and I make that configuration setting change at install time.  The setup for everything looks fine to me, configuration file looks ok, there were no warnings or errors in the validation check at install time, the Environment Variable is pointing to the right place, and the SSIS Package is installed in the SQL Server MSDB database.p  pThe problem is when the SSIS Package runs on the target computer, it keeps writing the text file to CTemp.  No matter what I do I cant seem to get it to write to the ESSISFileDropOff folder.  Its like the SSIS Package is stuck on CTemp and is ignoring the the XML configuration file setting on the target machine.  In the SQL Agent running the SSIS Package I even tried checking the box on the Job Step Properties screen, Data Sources tab and set the Connection String to ESSISFileDropOff and it still doesnt work.p  pIs there any place I could be missing where the SSIS Package is looking at CTemp  Could there be a cached value someplace that I am not aware of that forcing the package to stick on CTempp  pThanks.p

Negative 7003 pAs a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions59667whywouldieverpickcharovervarcharinsqlthisa previous posting which discussed when when would want to use CHAR over VARCHAR pointed out, one can gain performance advantages when the values stored are approximatelty the same length. Certainly I would selected CHAR as the datatype for storing a 2character State code data.p  pI would just like to confirm as a sanity check that this means that when one performs a SQL that filters on this coljumn that the filtered value must be padded with enough blanks to equal the defined length of the char field.p  pFor example, assume a table CODETABLE where column 10CHARCODE is defined as a CHAR10p  pSELECT  FROM CODETABLE WHERE 10CHARCODE   ABCDE     p  pand that if 10CHARCODE is a logical foreign key to another table but no specific relation integtrity constraint exists, that the values stored in the 10CHARCODE Lookup table should ideally be of the same datatype Char10 to avoid having to perform aan inefficient RTRIM function when joining.p  pWe have a baby size data warehouse and DBAs argue that Referential Integrity constraints are inefficient and so we end up having inconsistant datatype definitions of data across tables.p  pAre my impressions accuratep

Negative 7003 pI have a great love for Vim, even though I spend most of my time on windows machines. However, it always nagged me that for all its power and features, Vim still is stuck with this old, ugly, nonuserfriendly GUI. I wanted to contribute something to open source, and mainly my own sanity, by writing a fresh and modern new gui.p  pI started by cloning Vims source from herebr a hrefhttpcode.google.compvim relnofollowhttpcode.google.compvimap  pOnly to realize that strongI have no idea where to startstrong. This code seems massive and cavernous and ludicrously complicated for a text editor. I managed to discern basic things about the structure, and at least where the GUI files are, but I still really have no idea how they interface with the core of the text editor. I know Ill need to just sit down and read through it if I really want to do this, but I want to know if anyone has any good advice on how to tackle this kind of project, or if anyone has knowledge into the innerworkings of vim.p  pIn the best case, I could just send keystrokes to vim, and get output from it straight to whatever GUI I write, but I know its going to be messier than that. Just howp

Negative 7003 pI have a case where noninteractive devices have to push data to a server periodically over HTTP. I am thinking of taking an auth token approach to verify the validity of requests from these devices.p  pFirst the device wakes up and initiates a ssl connection and submits its credentials to the server the server verifies the credentials and generates a SHA based token, based on the credentials  some random input, and sends the token back to the devicep  pThis token must be present as a header in each http request that the device sends up. The server will use  a servlet filter that looks for this header and filters out messages that dont have it.p  pThere is no sensitive information transferred, I just want to make sure that the device talking to the server is a valid one, and not someone trying to mess around with invalid data. Wannabe hackers, script kiddies etc..p  pThe token needs to be stored somewhere where multiple nodes can verify that the request is valid  where do you recommend doing this p  pI can think of 3 approachesp  p1 Have a separate web service that maintains tokens and does the authentication  I cringe on the performance overhead of this for each requestp  p2 Maintain a Set of authenticated token in the Session, and let the servlet container take care of it using the built in clustering support Not sure if this is the most fool proof way p  p3 Use a database to store the tokens and verify it Considering Redis for thisp  pAlso, I think this approach has a vulnerability of allowing man in the middle attacks, but since the client sends data only for a few minutes I am taking a chance, any better approaches would be welcome.p

Negative 7003 pIm going through Programming In Scala 2nd Edition by Odersky, Spoon, and Venners, and this example threw me for a loop since it seemed to go against what I thought was true about functional programming and immutability. In the example and earlier in the book in Ch. 18, the authors claim that operations on an object can still be purely functional even when those operations might internally mutate the state of the object. The example, which is on p.442, Ch. 19, is thisp  precode class Queue[T] private     private[this] var leading List[T],     private[this] var trailing List[T]        private def mirror        if leading.isEmpty         while trailing.isEmpty           leading  trailing.head  leading          trailing  trailing.tail                   def head T         mirror      leading.head          def tail Queue[T]         mirror      new Queueleading.tail, trailing          def enqueue[U gt T]x U        new Queue[U]leading, x  trailing   codepre  pThe justification given is that, so long as it side effects are not visible to clients, something like this can be considered functional. I guess I can get behind that...I mean strictly speaking thats what defines a function. But admittedly and Im not really too savvy about what the JVM memory model guarantees, but arent there potential problems with that in this codep  pFor instance, if two threads are running operations on this queue, which looks like this to startp  precodeLeading Nil Trailing List1,2,3,4 codepre  pIsnt it possible that one thread could call head getting to this point in mirror before being descheduledp  precodeprivate def mirror        if leading.isEmpty         while trailing.isEmpty           leading  trailing.head  leading          gt trailing  trailing.tail               codepre  pAt which point the queue looks like thisp  precodeLeading List1 Trailing List1,2,3,4 codepre  pAnd when a second thread calls tail while the first is not active, this would be returnedp  precodeLeading Nil Trailing List1,2,3,4 codepre  pWhereas if the first threads head call were to finish, this would be returned after a subsequent tail call on that listp  precodeLeading List2,3,4 Trailing Nil codepre  pIm admittedly not great at this kind of stuff and concurrent programming is really mindbending for me, as Im sure it is for a lot of people, Im just curious what Im missing here.p
Negative 7003 pIm creating an authentication system for a group of websites. The emproblemem is that I have to use a preexisting Database, which has a strongusersstrong table already full of entries, and that one user can have several accounts. Basically, a user has one account per website he has access to its not the best way to do this, but I cant change it. Each account is represented by an entry in the strongusersstrong table, with emloginem, empasswordem, emnameem... and the important field strongwebsiteidstrong. This field tells the system what website that account has access to.p  pThe big problem is that some users with more than one account have the exact same loginpassword information for all of them. For example, one user has 3 accountsp  ul listrongaccount1strong login  charly  pwd  1234  name  Charles ... strongwebsiteid  1strongli listrongaccount2strong login  charly  pwd  1234  name  Charles ... strongwebsiteid  2strongli listrongaccount3strong login  charly  pwd  1234  name  Charles ... strongwebsiteid  3strongli ul  pSo if he goes to the website that has strongid  2strong and uses those credentials, hes granted access. If he goes to the website that has strongid  4strong, hes denied access.p  pMy problem is that since CakePHP does the login automatically, when a user tries to login, CakePHP checks strongonly the firststrong entry in the Database that matches the loginpassword submited in the form. So if a user is currently in the website with strongwebsiteid  3strong and tries to login, Cake finds the first entry account1, compares its strongwebsiteidstrong 1 in this case to the current websites id 3, and since theyre different, the access is not granted, strongbut it shouldstrong. Please note that the comparison of the websiteid vs the accounts websiteid is already being made manually in the login function.p  pThis how the login function looks like nowp  precodefunction login       userInfo  thisgtAuthgtuser      if  issetuserInfo            if userInfo[User][websiteid]  thisgtwebsiteid                Users gets access to a website that he has an account for                  else              User is denied access because his account is not registered for the current website             thisgtSessiongtdestroy             thisgtSessiongtsetFlashYou dont have access to this website, true             thisgtredirectthisgtAuthgtlogout                codepre  pWhat I would like is to be able to manually authorize the access to the current website by using the loginpassword submitted by the user to manually search in the emusersem table, and if I find a match in one of the user accounts, grant the access, or otherwise deny access. To sum up, strongavoid all the automagic of Auths component.strongp

Negative 7003 pIn a typical MVC application we have validation that occurs in many different places.  It might be clientside, in the controller, and then again at the data level.  If you have a business layer, then there is additional validation there as well.p  pHow do we unify all these so that were not violating DRY, and causing support nightmares when validations change  A subquestion is how to enable dynamic validation based on the model across all layers.p  pFor example  We may have a ViewModel that has data annotation attributes.  In MVC23 this unifies clientside and controller validation, but does not help with the data model unless you are using your data model as your view model, which isnt a good practice.p  pThis means you have to add the same validations to the data model and business layers, duplicating it.  Whats more, the data model might have subtly different validation requirements than the view model for instance, an entire data record might comprise several view models of a multistep wizard.  And only a complete record can be saved.p  pSome people add complex validation to the data model when using an ORM like EF or L2S with partial classes, which im not sure is the right path either.  It works for apps that are primarily data oriented data entry type apps, but would not work for apps that have more nondata business logic.p  pWhat Id like is some way to either generate validation for all layers, or a way to hook into a single validation system.  Does anything like that exist p

Im rewriting an application that currently searches something like this As soon as you click Enter on the search textbox, the DB is queried and displays 10 records. Then as you navigate through the records with the up and down arrows within the ListView control, it will query for the next 10 records depending on the direction your going. Looking at other questions, I couldnt find any that specifically addressed doing this with the ListView in VS2010. Ive done a little research on the Virtual Mode of the ListView, but figured since its only displaying 10 records at a time, the normal ListView would be fine. Im currently able to display 10 records, but am getting stuck trying to figure out how to keep track of and query for one more record.p  pHas anyone had any experience with this or possibly have some advice Thanksp

Negative 7003 pIve written a basic visualisation tool that pulls some data from a MySQL database into a few views, and does some maths in python. p  pIve built the tool, for the most part I now have a somewhat odd problemp  pIm trying to convey as much simple data as I can, using the graphics and the colour of the main tool I have at my disposal. p  pWithout going into the minutiae of the project I have two primary variables, A and B. A has 4 values, and B has 5. p  pI want to use Green when A4, Yellow for A3, Orange when A2 and Red when A1.  In the Bvariable space, I thought Id use saturation  100  5, 80  4, 60  3, 40  2 and 20  1p  pIm not wedded to these values  they make a kind of logical sense emquaem the story I want to tell, as well as mathematical sense, by their suggestion of distinct levels, or boundaries in the data. p  pOnly, they dont. The colors dont convey this information to the user. It is hard to visually differentiate the 100 colours from the 80  I guess this is due to the fact that our colour response isnt linear. p  pI wonder if anyone has any thoughts about how I might divvy up my two variable plans in a decently perceptible fashion, using colourp  pI appreciate this question might be in the wrong place  Im not sure where else I could ask about such a thing.p

Negative 7003 pWhats the best strategy for storing ecommerce product information i.e. product price, current price in a localizedcurrency environment p  pI came across an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9445175pricegetsmultipliedby100whensavingproductinspreeror94489379448937issue in Spree, an ecommerce engine for Ruby on Railsa regarding the display of currency using localization, delimiters, precision digits, etc.p  pHowever, a hrefhttpsgithub.comspreespreeissues1194 relnofollowresolving the display of price became more complex,a when we had to figure out if the strongstoring of values in the database should include the localization delimiter  precision digits or be normalizedstrong. The solution involves localizing both the display of the value as well as potentially normalizing the stored value in the database. But Im not sure if thats the standard practice scrubbing the data to fit a standard precision and delimiter OR modifying the model to take in a currency field, and keeping the input standard.p  pstrongCASE STUDYstrongp  pIf a product from the USA using en localization file is priced at 2.99, then it is stored in the database as 2.99.  If the site updates to be localized for Germany using de localization file, then it is priced at 2,99.  But should updates to that price and costprice value be stored as 2.99, or 2,99 If theyre stored at 2.99 and the value is returned back to the view from the model, then the localization will modify the value to be 2,99. p  pIm hesitant to standardize user input without their knowledge. Is standardizing currency values normal, or should the model change to handle multicurrency formatsp  pAn extra issue to note is that even though the Spree engine can change localization, I dont believe it can flip by userdemand yet. So its not technically a multicurrency environment, I believe Id like to pick a choice that can scale.p  pstrongRELATED QUESTIONSstrongp  ol lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9552009databasedesignaccountswithmulticurrencydatabase design accounts with multi currencyali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1844221currencymodelingindatabaseCurrency modeling in databaseali ol

Negative 7003 pMy desktop application has to download a file from the internet.  The path to the file is known, the file name itself is semi variable, i.e. someone else will be putting new files there, and my application will have to download those.p  pNow I want to make sure that the URL is safe, and that it will be interpreted correctly.  Also, if theres a  in a file name you never know, I do want it to be encoded.  Javascript has two distinct functions for this codeencodeURIcode and codeencodeURIComponentcode. The latter also encodes  characters, amongst other things. Of course, I could roll my own, but I figured that theres bound to be functions ready for that, and I might as well avoid making some old mistake.p  pI will be downloading the file with a object that uses the WinInet series of API functions a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa385096.aspxInternetOpena and its ilk.p  pSo I started rummaging around on MSDN, and sure enough, theres a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopbb773768.aspxUrlCanonicalizea.

Id rather concatenate the first portion of the URL with the URLEncoded filename.p  pAlso, they all have tons of different flags, different defaults which have changed over the course of the Windows versions, and I cant figure out the differences anymore.

Negative 7003 pI am rewriting a chess engine I wrote to run on magic bitboards. I have the magic functions written and they take a square of the piece and an occupancy bitboard as parameters. What I am having debates with myself is which one of these board representation schemes is fastermore practicalp  pscheme 1 There is a bitboard for each type of piece, 1 for white knights, 1 for black rooks. . . , and in order to generate moves and push them to the move stack, I must serialize them to find the square of the piece and then call the magic function. Then I must serialize that move bitboard and push them. The advantage is is that the attacking and occupancy bitboards are closer at hand.p  pscheme 2 A simple piece centric array [2][16] or [32] contains the square indices of the pieces. A simply loopthrough and call of the functions is all it takes for the move bitboards. I then serialize those bitboards and push them to the move stack. I also have to maintain an occupancy bitboard. I guess getting an attack bitboard shouldnt be any different I have to once again generate all the move bitboards and, instead of serializing them, I bitwise operate them in a mashup of magic.p  pIm leaning towards scheme 2, but for some reason I think there is some sort of implementation similar to scheme 1 that is standard. For some reason I cant find drawbacks of making a bitboard engine without actually using bitboards. I wouldnt even be using bitboards for king and knight data, just a quick array lookup.p  pI guess my question is more of whether there is a better way to do this board representation, because I remember reading that keeping a bitboard for each type of piece is standard maybe this is only necessary with rotated bitboards. Im relatively new to bitboard engines but Ive read a lot and Ive implemented the magic method. I certainly like the piece centric array approach  it makes a lot of arbitrary stuff like printing the board to the screen easier, but if there is a betterequalmore standard way can someone please point it out Thanks in advance  I know this is a fairly specific question and difficult to answer unless you are very familiar with chess programming.p  pLast minute question how is the speed of a lookup into a 2D array measure up to using a 1D array and adding 16  teamside to the normal index to lookup the piecep  pstrongeditstrong I thought I should add that I am valuing speed over almost all else in my chess implementation. Why else would I go with magic bitboards as opposed to simply arrays with slide datap

But, my view model is not a emDependencyObjectem, so I cannot do this.p  pI have tried using a emMultiBindingem  emMultiConverterem binding strongGrid.Visibilitystrong to strongExpander.IsExpandedstrong and strongMyPropertystrong, but this doesnt have the desired effect. strongMyPropertystrong doesnt get changed to strongGrid.Visibilitystrong when strongGrid.Visibilitystrong is updated as a result of strongExpander.IsExpandedstrong changing.p  pThe only option that seems to work is using an attached property on emGridem which binds to strongExpander.IsExpandedstrong and then use a callback function to programmatically change strongGrid.Visibilitystrong whenever the attached property changes. strongGrid.Visibilitystrong then binds to strongMyPropertystrong. This just seems like a messy way of doing it, but I am open to suggestions.p  pI guess what Im trying to do is almost like a twopronged binding where the two bindings are in opposite directions, one being emfromem a dependency property, the other being emtoem a CLR property.p  pThanks for any help that can be givenp

Negative 7003 pI have a project where Im databinding a gridview to a list, where one column is databound to a gridview. The problem I have is that with the double being 5.5 on one computer it appears as 5.5 in the gridview. But on another it looks like 55, the decimal mark dissapears. So 3.14 will look like 314 etc.p  pThe error occurs with the following codep  precodemyDatagrid.ItemsSource  someList Binding binding  new BindingDoubleValue myColumnInDatagrid.Binding  binding codepre  pIve also tried using a very simple valueconverter, that just return the double, and parsed it in ConvertBack. Im pretty new to WPF so Im sorry if Ive made some obvious mistakes, I just dont understand why it works on one computer but not on the other. Perhaps it should be noted that both of the computers use the same operating system, with the same language settings afaik at least.p

Negative 7003 pI have 2 Java packages, A amp B.

That is to say, I want my classes in package A to be package private so that they are hidden from the application developer.  However, I emdoem want my own package B to be able to access those classes which are package private.  Can this be done in Java  Do I basically just need to bite the bullet and make the classes public and just hope that the user doesnt try to use them  Or, do I need to replicate the classes that are in A inside of Bp  pMy preference would be something that is not hacky i.e. I dont want to use reflection.

But validation of the child entity state leaked into the parent entity codeAddModelcode and codeAddModificationcode methods. Since Im nowhere expert in DDD Im not sure if its ok or not. It could create more problems in future when child entities properties could not be simply set via properties and setting up some state based on passed parameters would require more complex work that assigning parameter value to property. I was under impression that we should concentrate logic about entity inside that entity wherever its possible. For me this approach turns parent object into some kind of EntityampFactory hybrid.p  pstrongThe third approach.strongp  pOk, well gonna invert the responsibilities of maintaining parentchild relations.p  precodepublic class CarsCompany      public virtual string Name  get protected set      public virtual IEnumerableltCarsModelgt Models  get  return new ImmutableSetltCarsModelgt this.models         private readonly ISetltCarsModelgt models  new HashedSetltCarsModelgt        protected CarsCompany                  public static CarsCompany Create string name              if string.IsNullOrEmpty name             throw new ArgumentException Invalid name specified.          return new CarsCompany                      Name  name                     protected internal void AddModel CarsModel model              this.models.Add model         public class CarsModel      public virtual CarsCompany Company  get protected set      public virtual string Name  get protected set      public virtual IEnumerableltCarsModificationgt Modifications  get  return new ImmutableSetltCarsModificationgt this.modifications         private readonly ISetltCarsModificationgt modifications  new HashedSetltCarsModificationgt        protected CarsModel                  public static CarsModel Create CarsCompany company, string name              if company  null             throw new ArgumentException Company is not specified.          if string.IsNullOrEmpty name             throw new ArgumentException Invalid name specified.          var model  new CarsModel                      Company  company,             Name  name                   model.Company.AddModel model          return model            protected internal void AddModification CarsModification modification              this.modifications.Add modification         public class CarsModification      public virtual CarsModel Model  get protected set      public virtual string Name  get protected set        protected CarsModification                  public static CarsModification Create CarsModel model, string name              if model  null             throw new ArgumentException Model is not specified.          if string.IsNullOrEmpty name             throw new ArgumentException Invalid name specified.          var modification  new CarsModification                      Model  model,             Name  name                   modification.Model.AddModification modification          return modification        ...  using var tx  session.BeginTransaction       var company  CarsCompany.Create Nissan     var model  CarsModel.Create company, Tiana     var modification  CarsModification.Create model, 2011      session.Persist company     tx.Commit   codepre  pThis approach got all validationcreation logic inside corresponding entities and I dont know if its good or bad, but by simple creation of the object with factory method we implicitly adding it to the parent object children collection. After transaction commit and session flush there will be 3 inserts into the database even tho I never written some add command in my code.

Negative 7003 pIm trying to write a method that will compute all permutations of a power set where order matters. I believe these are called arrangements. What I mean by this isp  precodea gt a,  a,b gt a,b, b,a, a, b,  a,b,c gt a,b,c, a,c,b, b,a,c, b,c,a, c,a,b, c,b,a, a,b, a,c, b,a, b,c, c,a, c,b, a, b, c,  codepre  petc. My impression is that, given a set S, I should generate every permutation of every subset of the powerset of S. So first generate the powerset, then map a permutation function onto each set. p  pThe problem is that this is immensely complex  something like Onk with k0..n.p  pIm wondering if there are any existing algorithms that do this sort of thing very efficiently perhaps a parallel implementation. Or perhaps even if a parallel powerset algorithm exists and a parallel permutation algorithm exists, I can combine the two.p  pThoughtsp

Negative 7003 pI was having an intermittent NHibernate issue that turned out to be caused by having an hbm mapping to a class as well as a Fluent NHibernate mapping. This was unintentional and once discovered I dropped the hbm mapping and all works well now.

Negative 7003 pConsider the following C programp  precodeint i  0  int postincrementi  return i   int main      i  postincrementi     return i  codepre  pWith respect to the 2011 version of the C standard known as C11, which of the following alternatives is truep  ol liC11 guarantees that main returns 0.li liC11 guarantees that main returns either 0 or 1.li liThe behavior of this program is undefined according to C11.li ol  pRelevant snippets from the C11 standardp  ul lip5.1.2.3 Program executionp  blockquote   pAccessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file, or calling a function   that does any of those operations are all side effects, which are changes in the state of   the execution environment. Evaluation of an expression in general includes both value   computations and initiation of side effects. Value computation for an lvalue expression   includes determining the identity of the designated object.p      pSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pairwise relation between evaluations   executed by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations.   Given any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A   shall precede the execution of B. Conversely, if A is sequenced before B, then B is   sequenced after A. If A is not sequenced before or after B, then A and B are   unsequenced. Evaluations A and B are indeterminately sequenced when A is sequenced   either before or after B, but it is unspecified which.sup13sup The presence of a sequence point   between the evaluation of expressions A and B implies that every value computation and   side effect associated with A is sequenced before every value computation and side effect   associated with B. A summary of the sequence points is given in annex C.p      p13 The executions of unsequenced evaluations can interleave. Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot interleave, but can be executed in any order.p blockquoteli lip6.5 Expressionsp  blockquote   pAn expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies computation of a   value, or that designates an object or a function, or that generates side effects, or that   performs a combination thereof. The value computations of the operands of an operator   are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator.p      pIf a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either a different side effect   on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar   object, the behavior is undefined. If there are multiple allowable orderings of the   subexpressions of an expression, the behavior is undefined if such an unsequenced side   effect occurs in any of the orderings.p blockquoteli lip6.5.2.2 Function callsp  blockquote   pThere is a sequence point after the evaluations of the function designator and the actual   arguments but before the actual call. Every evaluation in the calling function including   other function calls that is not otherwise specifically sequenced before or after the   execution of the body of the called function is indeterminately sequenced with respect to   the execution of the called function.sup94supp      p94 In other words, function executions do not interleave with each other.p blockquoteli lip6.5.2.4 Postfix increment and decrement operatorsp  blockquote   pThe result of the postfix  operator is the value of the operand. As a side effect, the   value of the operand object is incremented that is, the value 1 of the appropriate type is   added to it. [...] The value computation of the result is sequenced before the side effect of   updating the stored value of the operand. With respect to an indeterminatelysequenced   function call, the operation of postfix  is a single evaluation.p blockquoteli lip6.5.16 Assignmentsp  blockquote   pAn assignment operator stores a value in the object designated by the left operand. [...] The side effect of updating the stored value of the left operand is   sequenced after the value computations of the left and right operands. The evaluations of   the operands are unsequenced.p blockquoteli lip6.8 Statements and blocksp  blockquote   pA full expression is an expression that is not part of another expression or of a declarator.   Each of the following is a full expression [...] the expression in an expression statement [...] the optional expression in a return   statement. There is a sequence point between the evaluation of a full expression and the   evaluation of the next full expression to be evaluated.p blockquoteli ul  pThe three alternatives above correspond to the following three cases, respectivelyp  ol liThe side effect of the postfix increment operator is sequenced before the assignment in main.li liThe side effect of the postfix increment operator is sequenced either before or after the assignment in main, and C11 does not specify which. In other words, the two side effects are indeterminately sequenced.li liThe two side effects are unsequenced.li ol  pIt seems that the first alternative holds, by the following chain of reasoningp  ul lipConsider the rule strongEvery evaluation in the calling function including other function calls that is not otherwise specifically sequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is indeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function.strong in 6.5.2.2. Assumption A The side effect of the assignment operator in main is such an evaluation. Assumption B The phrase the execution of the called function includes both the value computation of the postfix increment operator and the side effect of the postfix increment operator. From these assumptions and the above rule, it follows that either I the value computation and the side effect of the postfix increment operator are both sequenced before the side effect of the assignment operator in main, or II the value computation and the side effect of the postfix increment operator are both sequenced after the side effect of the assignment operator in main.pli lipConsider the rule strongThe side effect of updating the stored value of the left operand is sequenced after the value computations of the left and right operands.strong This rule rules out case I above. It follows that case II holds. QEDpli ul  pOverall, this looks like a pretty strong argument. Also, it corresponds to what one would intuitively consider the most likely alternative.p  pHowever, it does rely on specific interpretations of the terms evaluation and execution of the called function Assumptions A and B and a not entirely straightforward line of reasoning, so I wanted to put it out there to see if people have reasons to believe that this interpretation is incorrect. Note that footnote 94 is equivalent with this interpretation only if it applies also in the sense that the caller does not interleave with the callee, which in turn implies that interleave means interleaving in the abab sense, since obviously a caller interleaves with the callee in the weaker aba sense. Also, alternatives 2 and 3 would seem plausible in a scenario where the compiler inlines the function and then performs the same kinds of optimizations that motivate why the expression codei  icode has undefined behavior.p

Negative 7003 pIm displaying a useruploaded image preview on my site, but I want to be able to vertically center it within a div.  I have attempted to do this by setting the images codemargintopcode using Javascript once its finished uploading as follows where codeimgcode is the image in questionp  precodereader.onloadend  function      var parentDiv  img.parent     img.cssmargintop, parentDiv.height  img.height  2  codepre  pThe a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMFileReader relnofollowFileReader documentationa Ive read leads me to believe that codeonloadendcode will be called once the file upload has completed, and that seems to be the case.  Regardless of the size of the image, however, codeimg.heightcode is returning code0code at the time codeonloadendcode is called.p  pIt seems that this is due to the fact that the value simply isnt available yet.  If I upload a second image clearing the existing image preview, then reupload the first image, the function works codeimg.heightcode returns the correct value. Calling it via the console afterwards returns correctly as well.p  pIs there an accepted way of handling this Is there any way to know when the value of code.heightcode will be usable other than calling it at intervals until it is greater than zero  Thanksp

Negative 7003 pneed some help with saxon.net.p  pCan anybody tell me how to output a xslt transformed xlm into a asp.net literalp  precode NOTE Saxon now uses System.Xml internally on the .NET platform. codepre  p We could import it and use any of its derived classes, methods, and so forth,  but in this example we will be using a FileStream for both the source  and transformation files, and Saxon will be taking care of things from there,  so theres no need to import System.Xml for this particular example. Private Sub PageLoadsender As [Object], e As EventArgs      Create two strings that represent the source file and      transformations file.  These values could be set using      a variety of methods e.g. QueryString but for now      we will keep things simple and hardcode these values.     Dim sourceUri As [String]  Server.MapPathbeispiel1.xml     Dim xsltUri As [String]  Server.MapPathbeispiel1.xsltp  precode The new Saxon engine for the .NET platform allows the  ability to pass in a Stream instance directly.  Given that the Stream class implements IDisposable, we  can use the using keywordcodeblock to ensure that  our resources are properly cleaned up, freeing up  valuable system resources in the process.  [UPDATE Check that.  This really should read  close all of the file streams we opened automagically.  While its true were cleaning up system resources  Its not like theres really a choice.  One way  or another the stream needs to be closed, this  Just does this for us so we dont have to worry about it. Using sXml As FileStream  File.OpenReadsourceUri      We need to do this for each Stream that we pass in for processing.     Using sXsl As FileStream  File.OpenReadxsltUri          Now we simply create a Processor instance.         Dim processor As New Processor           Load the source document into a DocumentBuilder         Dim builder As DocumentBuilder  processor.NewDocumentBuilder           Because we have created the DocumentBuilder with a file stream          we need to set the BaseUri manually, as this information is no          longer available to the Saxon internals when a Stream, regardless          of what the source of this Stream happens to be, is used for creating          the DocumentBuilder instance.  With this in mind, we need to create          an instance of a Uri using the sourceUri we created above.         Dim sUri As New UrisourceUri           Now set the baseUri for the builder we created.         builder.BaseUri  sUri           Instantiating the Build method of the DocumentBuilder class will then          provide the proper XdmNode type for processing.         Dim input As XdmNode  builder.BuildsXml           Create a transformer for the transformation file, compiling and loading this          file using the NewXsltCompiler method of the Saxon.Api namespace.         Dim transformer As XsltTransformer  processor.NewXsltCompiler.CompilesXsl.Load           Set the root node of the source document to be the initial context node.         transformer.InitialContextNode  input           Create a serializer         Dim serializer As New Serializer           Set the serializer to write the transformation output directly          to ASP.NETs Response.Output stream.         serializer.SetOutputWriterResponse.Output           Run the transformation.         transformer.Runserializer           and were done.

On my Nexus 7 running 4.1.1 Jelly Bean with Cordova 1.9.0, the keyboard comes up but when you type nothing shows up in the text field or text area.p  pIm pretty sure my code is fine since it works on the iPhone and Android 2.3.5, but here is the snippet in question just in casep  precode  ltbody onloadonBodyLoadgt   ltdiv datarolepage idmainpagegt        ltdiv dataroleheader datathemeagt            lth2gtLightweightlth2gt       ltdivgt        ltdiv datarolecontentgt         ltdivgt           lta href datarolebutton dataiconcheck dataiconposbottom datathemeb onClickonClickInterrogategtInterrogateltagt         ltdivgt            ltdiv aligncentergt               lta href datarolebutton datainlinetrue dataiconforward datathemeb onClickdownloadFilegtSendltagt               lta href datarolebutton datainlinetrue dataicongear dataiconposright datathemeb onClickonClickSettingsgtSettingsltagt           ltdivgt            ltdiv aligncentergt               ltlabel forserverUrlgtServer URLltlabelgt               ltinput typetext namename idserverUrl valueurlGoesHeregt               ltlabel forzipFilegtZip Fileltlabelgt               ltinput typetext namename idzipFile valuetran1.zipgt           ltdivgt             ltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt                 ltlabel fortextareagtTextarealtlabelgt                 lttextarea nametextarea idtextareagturlGoesHerelttextareagt             ltdivgt     ltdivgt       ltdiv datarolefootergt            lth1gt ampcopy 2012 Company Name lth1gt       ltdivgt   ltdivgt    codepre  pp  pI just tried this on Android 2.3.5 and it works fine.

This works fine.p  pThe problem is that Im executing a function each time the slider crosses a section boundary indicated by codecode. This function takes approximately 30ms to execute its constructing a DocumentFragment and inserting it into the document. During this time the browser does not respond to events, so jQuery UI stops adjusting the sliders position and the drag is prematurely ended the user is forced to release the mouse button and commence a new drag. This makes the slider feel jerky and buggy.p  pIs there a solution to this problemp  pstrongEditstrong Ive created a simple a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnKgd7 relnofollowfiddlea which demonstrates the problem. Note that while the drag is essentially paused during the execution of the slow function, it resumes afterwards. This makes me suspect that theres something about my more complex scenario which is causing the drag event to be cut short perhaps the DOM manipulation is causing the position of the slider to change briefly.p  pstrongEditstrong After further investigation Im much closer to understanding the problem. The DOM manipulation code contains a line something like code.droppable.removecode. This removes the matching elements from the DOM after detaching any event handlers bound to them and removing any associated data. If I use code.detachcode instead, the behaviour is the same as in the simple fiddle above. Something untoward is happening during the cleanup.p

Negative 7003 pI created one application using Spring on Tomcat, and the second app using Java EE EJB  JSF on JBoss AS 7. As ORM I choose Hibernate, or I think so.p  pSuppose, I have a page with trip offers. I can click on a link to load trip descriptions using AJAX.p  pWith the Spring version, after choosing a description link, only one query is sent to the database. This is good.p  pBut with the Java EE version, in the same case, seven queries are sent Seven queries for each trip offer displayed on the current site. So, if I can see 4 trip offers, there are 47 SQL queries That is why the performance is low.p  pThe service layer, so SQL queries, are the same in both versions. In the Spring version, the request is sent by post using jQuery. In Java EE, I use JSF AJAX support.p  pWhat is the cause of this behaviour I am not sure, maybe Hibernate is not really used in the Java EE version In persistance.xml I have the following codeltprovidergtorg.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistenceltprovidergtcode.p

Negative 7003 pWe recently upgraded from Mule 3.1.2 to 3.3.0.  We are using Mule deployed inside a war in JBoss 5.1.

We did not change anything to the underlying processors implementation neither, this was a pure migration.  I tried to remove all our specific processors, and replace them with a single one which does nothing but log one line. Now the startup of each flow is reduced to 1.5s, but still a lot slower than with 3.1.2.  Overall the problem grows with the number of flows and component loaded If I comment half of the flows, the single flow startup time is improved by 1 or 2s p  pThis seems to be specific when deployed in a war in JBoss, I tried the exact same muleconfig.xml in a standalone Mule app created from a basic maven archetype and all flows starts smoothly and quickly as in 3.1.2. p  pIs there any change in the way flows are initialized in Mule 3.3 which could explain this   Any idea about what I could check or try  p  pThanks for your help, p  pLaurentp

Negative 7003 pSo, I have made some sample KMLKMZ files in the past, largely by hand, and have discovered a few a hrefhttpcode.google.compkmlsamplesissuesdetailid300ampqkmzampcolspecID20Type20Summary20Product20Status20Stars20Internal relnofollowinconsistenciesa with Google Earth as a result of this work.  For the most part, I thought I had a good handle on what I needed to do for specific versions of GE.  Recently, I attempted to add some automation to my KMLKMZ sample files to customize them for certain clients based on a given CSV of points and other metadata.p  pI want to reach out to those with experience creating KMZ files from Java with custom icons or content.  Heres the wrinkle Im stuck onp  pI created, by hand, a bunch of styles and custom icons to better display client data.  Recently, I created a Java app that allows me to save a great deal of time by automating the KMLKMZ production.  These styles were copied directly from the examples into my Java code with escapes in their rightful places.  The Java code initially built the KML, then I packaged the KML with the icons folder from my examples, zipped and saved as KMZ.  All worked fine.p  pI then added a code block largely based on a hrefhttpwww.javaexamples.comcreatezipfilemultiplefilesusingzipoutputstreamexample relnofollowthis examplea and added all my icons as resources to the jar.  I then built the file as a .zip and verified that the KML and Icon files in appropriate folders were in the zip.  They were.  All was happy with the world.p  pI then changed the output filename to .kmz instead of .zip and tried to run the output in Google.  None of my custom icons are loaded.  The KML works fine, points and polygons are there with the proper style colors, but there are boxes with Xs in the middle as if it cant access the icons.p  pIf I rename the output KMZ to zip, unpack and run the KML inside it, everything works as expected.  If I rezip and rename to KMZ, its broken again.  p  pHeres the real fun though.  If I take the KML out of the KMZ, repack with the icons folder from the resources from my workspace, save as KMZ and load into google earth, it works OK.p  pI feel like that is telling me that my java.util.zip code is somehow corrupting the images to a point where GE doesnt know what to do with them.  But Im completely confused as to why they work fine when unpackaged, but then again broke when repackaged from the same location.p  pAnyone have any ideas  Apologies in advance for not posting code.

Negative 7003 pI have an app with some localization made by adding folders like codevaluescode, codevaluesescode, codevaluesrucode etc. In every folder I have file named strings.xml with, guess what, strings. Some of them need to be in all languages, but some needed just in one for inner needs of the app. But if there is a string in codevaluesstrings.xmlcode that is missing in other versions of this file, it causes an error. I tried to add one more file with p  precodeltresourcesgt     ltstring namekeygtValueltstringgt      ... ltresourcesgt  codepre  pwith different name, like codevaluesadditionalStringscode, but it didnt worked. So I just copied all the strings in all the files to fix the app. But how can I avoid it and store some extra strings in separate .xml p  pAdditional part of the question Also, if it is possible I guess, it is to store some more info likep  precode ltresourcesgt         ltcustomObject namemyNamegt            text  Value            extraField  3.14         ltcustomObject gt          ...  ltresourcesgt codepre  pin custom xml and get it via usual codeR.filename.objectName.subFieldNamecode, it would be awesome.

Is it possible using pocketsphinx to implement such a speech recognition.

Is it possible to implement this flow using pocketsphinx If it is not can someone point me to right direction for such a solution Thank you.p

Negative 7003 pI am writing a chat bot that uses past conversations to generate its responses. Currently I use text files to store all the data but I want to use a database instead so that multiple instances of the bot can use it at the same time.p  pHow should I structure this databasep  pMy first idea was to keep a main table like codecreate table Sessions startTime INT,ip INT, botVersion REAL, length INT, tableName TEXTcode. Then for each conversation I codecreate table ltgenerated namegttimestamp INT, message TEXTcode with all the messages that were sent or received during that conversation. When the conversation is over, I insert the name of the new table into codeSessionstableNamecode. Is it ok to programmatically create tables in this manner I am asking because most SQL tutorials seem to suggest that tables are created when the program is initialized.p  pAnother way to do this is to have a huge codecreate table Messagesid INT, message TEXTcode table that stores every message that was sent or received. When a conversation is over, I can add a new entry to codeSessionscode that includes the codeidcode used during that conversation so that I can look up all the messages sent during a certain conversation. I guess one advantage of this is that I dont need to have hundreds or thousands of tables. p  pI am planning on using SQLite despite its low concurrency since each instance of the bot may make thousands of reads before generating a response which will result in one write. Still, if another relational database is better suited for this task, please comment.p  pNote There are other questions on SO about storing chat logs in databases but I am specifically looking for how it should be structured and feedback on the above ideas.p

Negative 7003 pI am creating a simple application that entails multiple activities.  It is necessary for my application to resume one of two activities based on a certain system preference.  Because of this, I have implemented a codeDispatchercode class that is linked to codeaction.MAINcode, that then starts the correct codeActivitycode by examining the system preferences within its codeonResumecode callback.p  h2The Problemh2  pSince I am doing this in codeonResumecode, when the back button is pressed on any of the resulting activities, the codeDispatchercode is resumed, and as a result it again tries to start the same codeActivitycode again.  This prevents the user from ever leaving the application unless they press the home button.p  h2Some Codeh2  pHere is some code excerpts from my classes to help clarify my situationp  pemDispatcher.onResumevoid  voidemp  precodeprotected void onResume       super.onResume      ifhandled          Intent activityswitcher          If a game is active...         ifmanager.isGameActive              Start the the Game Manager with the appropriate game.             activityswitcher  new Intentthis, GameManager.class                  If a game is not active...          else              Start the Game Menu             activityswitcher  new Intentthis, Menu.class                   Start the appropriate activity         startActivityactivityswitcher         overridePendingTransition0, 0          else          Finish the application         finish         overridePendingTransition0, 0       codepre  pSome of the variables are as followsp  ul licodemanagercode is the variable representing my class that interfaces with the system preferences.li licodehandledcode is the variable that determines if the event has been handled yet see Attempted Solution 1 belowli ul  h2Attempted Solution 1h2  pI have considered implementing a boolean class variable, codehandledcode, that is tested before the activities are started.  If the value is found to be codetruecode, then the codeDispatchercode simple makes a call to codefinishcode, however if the value is codefalsecode, then the appropriate activity is started and codehandledcode is set to codetruecode so that when the application returns to this codeActivitycode, it will simply finish.p  pemThis will not work, because...em p  pIf the user pressed the home button on one of the resulting activities, then when they resume the application, they will be placed on the dispatcher activity, and the application will immediately finish because it thinks that it was handled the variable is still true.p  h2Attempted Solution 2h2  pI tried to find some way to only run to the codeDispatchercode once per application life cycle.  This makes sense because the user would never want to return to the codeDispatchercode as it is an codeActivitycode that should only be ran once at launch time.  So, I included a counter that would be incremented each time onResume was called, and reduced to 0 each time finish was called.p  pemThis will not work, because...em p  pAgain, if the user presses the home button, then when the application is relaunched, the codeDispatchercode will strongthinkstrong that it has already been run once because there was no call to codefinishcode, and will immediately finish again.p  h2Attempted Solution 3h2  pI figured that if I could somehow determine which activity was previously active, then I could dynamically react to the case where the user pressed the back button, and then emand only thenem inform the codeDispatchercode that it should finish, then there would be no immediate finishes in the case when the user presses the home button.p  pThis was accomplished by using a static function codereturningFromMenucode that, when called from the menu codeActivitycode, raised a flag in the codeDispatchercode class that informed the it to finish.p  h2Attempted Solution 4 Current Implementationh2  pSimply moving all of this activity switching code into onCreate.  This would enforce the one time nature of the codeDispatchercode.p  pemThis might work, because...emp  pThis will handle the case where the user returns to the activity using onResume, and, since there will be no flags, there is no issue when returning to the application after pressing the home button.p  hr  h2My Questionh2  pIs there any way to determine which codeActivitycode was last finished, other than having to use a static method or member  I know that this is a very bad practice and would like to avoid it  if possible.p  h2Updatesh2  pemLast Updated 12 Feb 2013 345PM ESTemp  pApproach 4 seems to be working for my purposes, however I still think that the question here could be of great use to developers, and will refrain from answering my question until I have given enough time for a more holistic solution to be posted.p

Negative 7003 pIm just a guy trying to learn some Java. The actual coding part works just fine for me, and until now Ive been working in Eclipse to new guys like myself, Eclipse is a really great free piece of software for writing and compiling code. But Eclipse compiles the code by itself, and Im determined to learn how to do this without any training wheels, seeing as Ill probably need to do so someday. However, I already tried manually compiling my code with Command Prompt a few months ago, and ultimately I just got tired of banging my head against the brick wall. It seems that when I try to compile a simple HelloWorld file in cmd, everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. And it seems that Im not the only one who keeps getting thrown off code because of this ridiculous first hurdle. Until now Ive slowly been able to work around everything that keeps popping up, but this new problem is completely beyond any advice that I can find on the Internet.p  pI have my HelloWorld class ready to run. It is in the same file as my .java file. I have managed to compile it with the use of an environment variable specifying the location of the javac tool. Now all I need to do is invoke the java tool to run the file.p  pCreating a new environment variable specifying the location of java gives the following error message on cmdp  blockquote   pError could not open Clibamd64jvm.cfgp blockquote  pI have no idea why its picking this directory, leaping straight to lib instead of going through Program Files.p  pSpecifying the location of the java tool in cmd, as my book tells me to do, gives the following error messagep  blockquote   pCProgram is not recognized as an external command, operable program, or batch file.p blockquote  pwhich of course is only the case because Im trying to specify the path leading to the java tool, whilst my command directory has already been confined to CJava Code, the location of my class file, which is necessary because thats the file Im trying to run.p  pSo in short, the only way around this I can see is to specify two command directories at once, which Im pretty sure is impossible.p  pstrongSolutionstrong In my case, this was solved by two things first reinstalling Java. It seems that I was using the wrong architecture version Oracles site may have been assuming that my computer was 32 bit. This seemed to deal with the cannot find jvm.cfg issue.

Negative 7003 pOk, so Im still having trouble figuring out the special objects in tables idea for JTables.  I got the comboBox to show up in a specific cell for another table, but this time I need a JTextArea to show up in only one specific cell.  Apparently, the method I used for the combobox is limited to text fields, comboboxes and one other component I dont recall which.  Anyway, Im declaring the table as followsp  precode    DefaultTableModel projDTM  new DefaultTableModel         String[] colNames  Attribute,Data         projDTM.setColumnIdentifierscolNames         curProj  new JTableprojDTM               public boolean isCellEditableint row, int column                  ifcolumn  0 return false                 ifrow  0 return false                 return true                                               curProj.setFillsViewportHeighttrue         curProj.setCellSelectionEnabledtrue         curProj.setSelectionModeListSelectionModel.SINGLESELECTION         curProj.getColumnModel.getColumn0.setMaxWidth100         curProj.getColumnModel.getColumn1.setMaxWidth400     JScrollPane tablePane  new JScrollPanecurProj         tablePane.setPreferredSizenew Dimension500,200 codepre  pThe table contents are later added as theyre retrieved from their storage location such as a file or database by simply using codeprojDTM.addcode andor codeprojDTM.setValueAtcode if it already contains old data.  One of the items recovered is a string of items separated by commas basically an array of items that I would much rather show as a list in their select cell than a long comma separated string as it is now for easier reading.  What would be the easiest way to set this up  I saw some other posts regarding this suggesting the JTextArea, but Im not quite sure how to implement that in the table the way its currently setup.  I only need one of the tables cells to be modified while the rest should remain as they are.  Also, the data in this list is read only format, so they wont need to edit the cell this is going into at all and it will always be at the same position in the table.p  pAny suggestions  p  pIm quite new to Java still, so go easy on me.p  pEdit Still no luck getting the specific cell to use the JTextArea or anything other than JTextField, JComboBox, or JButton. Everywhere I look it only shows how to change a whole column to a different component type such as codetable.getColumnModel.getColumn1.setCellEditorcode. It doesnt necessarily have to be a JTextArea either, just some form of topdown list that will display in a single cell.p

Negative 7003 pIm not quite sure how to phrase this, but is there a good way to implement a table where the columns are essentially interchangeablep  pExample you have a Users model and want to allow two Users to be friends. The obvious way, to me, would be to have a table containing two columns friend1 and friend2 that each containing the key to a User.  This makes it awkward for saying something like are user1 and user2 friends because you have to check for friend1user1 AND friend2user2 OR friend1user2 AND friend2user1.  It would work, but it just seems awkward to me that every time you want to get something from that table youre looking in both columns. Is there a more elegant way do thisp

Negative 7003 pI have an ASP.NET MVC3 Application that is calling two WCF Services.

Stackoverflow is not letting me type local.host. At this point of time, I had two instances of VS2012 running. One was running the services and the other was running the Frontend application which was calling these services. Everything worked fine. Both were hosted using IIS Express which comes with VS2012.p  pThen I hosted my services on a server machine. I deleted the service references on the UI App on my local machine and then added the new service references. I can also see the hosted services on my local machine using the browser. p  pThe web.config was automatically updated with new endpoints.p  pBut when I run my application and expect it to call the hosted services, it instead throws an error saying There was no endpoint listening at a hrefhttplocal.host28089ServiceName1.svc relnofollowhttplocal.host28089ServiceName1.svca p  pI dont understand why and from where it is still calling the old configuration. Ive tried cleaning, rebuilding, removingand readding service references, restarting VS, restarting my system but to no avail. p  pAny pointers will be helpful. Thanks.p

Negative 7003 pRecently my team recently upgraded from VS 2010 to VS 2012. At the same time we created a branch of our code base, one that we needed to work on in VS 2010 for legacy support and bug fixes, and the current version that would be worked on 2012. After the upgrade we decided to make use of partial diagrams in our EDMX but a few days later we had to merge that EDMX into a different branch that is opened in VS 2010. p  pThe problem we seem to be having is that the designer for the EDMX will not load in VS2010 now that the partial diagrams are there. Has anyone else experienced this problem Is it known problem Any solutions out there Ive tried hitting google but Im not finding anyone with the same problem.p

Negative 7003 pIm trying to add HTTP Conditional Get functionality to the first page of a mobile site. However, what Im seeing is making me think that Safari simply doesnt support HTTP Conditional Get for the first document it loads.p  pI tested this by making a new Rails 3.2.13 application, with one action that looks like thisp  precodedef index   lastmodified  Date.today   etagobj  something something   freshwhen lastmodified lastmodified, etag etagobj, public false end codepre  pThe request headers contain both an Etag and LastModified, as expectedp  precode[cachetest] curl I httplocalhost5000test HTTP1.1 200 OK  Etag 79b547467286b3e20fad13f73fc1bf78 LastModified Wed, 24 Apr 2013 000000 GMT ContentType texthtml charsetutf8 CacheControl maxage0, private, mustrevalidate XUaCompatible IEEdge XRequestId 8ace0b71533b2bc036bd84b12289cda6 XRuntime 0.012269 Server WEBrick1.3.1 Ruby1.9.320120420 Date Wed, 24 Apr 2013 210649 GMT ContentLength 0 Connection KeepAlive SetCookie cachetestsessionBAh7B0kiD3Nlc3Npb25faWQGOgZFRkkiJTM0NWRjNDgyZGQwNWJmMGZkNmIzNmY4NjVmNWEzMDkwBjsAVEkiEF9jc3JmX3Rva2VuBjsARkkiMTlYK0VrMERGdEsvOVlzbVJ5N1FPQlZXVDRwak9zQ3QzS3ZXZ1pvbnJocjg9BjsARg3D3D0902ae8a505527bd49d969753ddf1d2bd4c716eb path HttpOnly codepre  pOn Firefox 20.0 and Chrome 26.0.1410.65 this acts like I expect On the second load, the browser sends IfModifiedSince and IfNoneMatch in the request, and receives a 304 Not Modified.p  pHowever, its not doing this on Safari. On Safari it sends neither IfModifiedSince nor IfNoneMatch, and as youd expect, it then fully reloads the page from the server. I am seeing this on Safari 6.0.3 on my MacBook Pro, Safari in the iOS Simulator using an iPhone with iOS 6.1, and on an iPad Mini with iOS 6.1.3.p  pAnd whats really strange about this is that Safari clearly supports Conditional Get for subsequent requests CSS, JS, images, etc  I can see them clearly after the main HTML page comes through.

But maybe Im expecting too much from Apple here.pli lipIf Im not missing something obvious, does anybody know of any workaroundspli ol
Negative 7003 pIve received a project from someone that includes an Arduino Uno board with some sensors and lights with an USB cable and a documented protocol for communicating with this board through a COM port. It works fine with some existing code, but I need to port the whole project to a Windows RT environment using an ARM processor and including the Metro interface for the application. And its going to be completely rewritten...br First of all, my Windows RT device does have an USB port so it can connect to the board. But the challenge is to communicate with the board to read out the sensors and manipulate the lights and I happen to have problems finding some useful libraries, tutorials or other information about how to make these work together.br This project works fine with other Windows versions, though. I just need something specific for Windows RTARMMetro.p

Negative 7003 pI have a very simple design at present, created using Ruby 2.0 and the Rails 4 beta.p  pI have users, and groups. A User can be a member of multiple groups, and a Group can have multiple users as members. I thus have a join model, UserGroup, which only contains userid and groupid. As followsp  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany usergroups, dependent destroy     hasmany groups, through usergroups     acceptsnestedattributesfor usergroups, allowdestroy true end  class Group lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany usergroups, dependent destroy     hasmany users, through usergroups end  class UserGroup lt ActiveRecordBase     belongsto user, inverseof usergroups     belongsto group, inverseof usergroups      validates userid,   presence true     validates groupid,  presence true end codepre  pI have found lots of stuff about acceptsnestedattributesfor which seems to show creating a single associated object on createupdate. What I want, is a multi option select box where I can select multiple choices from a list of all groups currently in the system that I want the user to be a member of, and on submit it will generate all the usergroup associations for me.p  pI cannot work out what I need in either the controller or view to take advantage of this. I currently havep  precodelt formforuser do f gt     ltdiv classfieldgt         lt f.label username gtltbr gt         lt f.textfieldusername gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classfieldgt         lt f.label groupids, Group memberships gtltbr gt         lt f.select groupids, groups.collect g [g.name, g.id], , multiple true gt     ltdivgt lt end gt codepre  pin the view andp  precodedef create     user  User.newuserparams     user.save end  def userparams     params.requireuser.permitforename, surname, email, groupids end codepre  pin my controller along with all the other actions which im not testing right now of course.p  pThis is not working. When I go to the edit page for an existing user who has group memberships they show up correctly in the multiitem select box, but changing memberships or setting them on a new user does not work. My user object saves but none of the related usergroup objects are being created or destroyed. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong here and what I need to do to get it working Ive spent the past few hours trawling StackOverflow and Google and have got nowhere...p

Negative 7003 pI have one of those questions which are hard to be asked or answered in a forum. Recently I have been tasked with designing and implementing an application which would run on android OS. Since I come from the .net world, I decided to use Xamarin.Android framework previously known as mono for android. I did some research on the target framework and come up with a rough design. But since I am new to android world, I am not sure my design is the best oneore even an acceptable one. I will try to be as brief with my description as I can.  The basic requirements for the application arep  ul liThe application must be capable of providing different GUI to different users.li liThe application must display data fetched from the server.li liThe application must provide means for a user to modify the server data.li liWhen one of the users modifies the server data other users must be notified. li ul  pBased on my research I come up with the followingp  pTo provide customized GUI for each user, the application would first authenticate the user than retrieve a xml file from the server which would be than used to programmatically build the GUI. Since I have to support the device rotation and different devices this means a lot of work, so any thoughts on this would be very welcome. p  pI think the best way for the application to communicate with the server is by calling the REST based servicesGET to retrieve the initial data and PUT to update the server state.p  pWhen the server state will be modified by one of the users, all other users will be notified using notificationsGoogle cloud messaging or GCM which replaced the old C2DM. Since most of the activities would rely on notifications to display updates I think the best way to implement this is to create an android service. The service would be started with the application and would run as long as the application. When the service would be started it would register it self with the GCM and than use broadcasts to notify the current activity that something has changed. p  pI apologise for a long post but I tried to be as brief as I could. As I said, this is a very rough design so any thoughts, ideas or criticism would be very welcome.p  pUrop

Negative 7003 pI am automating a process for my work and am trying to address some issues that will occur in the future. Part of my process is to import different spreadsheets, look for employee names and then find out who their manager is. The problem I am faced with is that people are known as different names on different systems. For example, somebody named Donald Donaldson may be called Don Donaldson on the System, but has his full name on the employee list. Alternatively, Dave Davidison is David Davidson on the system.p  pThis occurs a number of times as some people appear 2 times on the System list and will slow down the entire process while my colleagues manually fix the issues. To address this, I created 3 tablesDynamic Named Ranges on my Data Tab. Each table sample found below had a different purpose a list of wrong names names, a list of replacement names Rep and alist of the names extracted from the System Compare. I want to look through the Compare list to see if there are any instances of names appearing. If it finds an instance then it will replace the name with the correct onep  pI feel that I am very close to achieving what needs done, but I lack that moment of brilliance to help me burst through.p  pemstrongMy Approachemstrongp  pI have 3 Dynamic Named Ranges range length will change depending on what is extracted from the other files and I have stored them as 3 dynamic arrays for that very reason. My code is looping through each element in Names, each in Rep and each in Compare. If the value in Compare z is equal to the value in Names x then we change the value of it to what is in Rep so z  y The problem with that is that only the value of z changes, and not the corresponding value in my array. i.e. Don Donaldson is the 3rd element in Compare. I find a match so Z changed from Don Donaldson to Donald Donaldson. Compare3, however, remains Don Donaldson.p  pI have tried making a 4th dynamic array, and and using ReDim to increase the length of it with every iteration. With every match myArrindex is equal to y, and after the loop a 4th named range TestRange is set to the value of this array, this approach does not work either.p  pIs anyone able to help me How do I change the value of an element in an Array compare and also how do I output this new array to a named range p  pMy Code and a sample of my data is shown below.p  pPleas help.

When you are over it and press some button, the element is changed and mouse is not over it any more onmouseout event should be triggered. This workaround works in firefox, but not in chrome. Is there any way how to properly detect onmouseout I have read something about mutation events, however I would consider these as last resort as they have performance impact. As I am not using any framework yet, I would like not to use it just to resolve this ridiculous issue. Usecase for this is custom dropdown menu with variable height with search functionality which has some onmouseoveronmouseout styling changes similar to native select field. p

Negative 7003 pNormally, hibernate uses POJO classes and JPA to manage entities.  This works fine if youre working with a database with a known table name with known columns.  In my case, I have both known and unknown tables in my database.  In a known table, there are rows which have the names of unknown tables where I can find specific data pertaining to the detail for that row.p  pI know that there is one foreign key pertaining to the id of the parent row and I know the name of that column.  I also know that there is a 2nd column, which combined with the foreign key, makes a unique identifier for that row.  p  pIn other words, suppose I have table PARENT with the following datap  precodeId   Table name   ... 1    CHILD1 2    CHILD2 3    CHILD1 ... codepre  pThen there would be tables CHILD1 and CHILD2 that I couldnt assume to exist prior to reading table PARENT as followsp  precodeParentId  RowId  Column1 Column2 Column3 ... 1         1      ...     ...     ... 1         2      ...     ...     ... 3         1      ...     ...     ... codepre  pNotice that while I know about the existence of columns ParentId and RowId, I have no idea about the names of Column1, Column2, Column3.  Similarly, if I were to show you CHILD2 table, there would be a ParentId and a RowId, but I couldnt tell you the names of the other columns.p  pI saw that Hibernate can deal with such things and they call them Dynamic Models.  They can be set and accessed as Maps with key and value.  However, although you can access data with a name, all the documentation requires that the column names are defined in the hbm.xml file.  This implies that I have to define Column1, Column2, Column3, and I simply cannot know prior to runtime.  It seems intuitive to me that with a Map, you could load all data under keyvalues where all the keys would be represented by the columns of that particular table so that you could simply cycle through all keys, but Hibernate doesnt seem to support it.p  pI happened to see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3617687isitpossibletodynamicallydefinecolumnnamesinhibernatejpathisa question, and while similar to my situation, unlike the OP of that question, I do not know the names of the columns in this table.p  pIm using hibernate 4.2 which is recent.  Does anyone know if such a thing is possible or if there is perhaps another way of doing it preferably without having to change the database  Many thanksp

Negative 7003 pIve written an licensing system, which checks different aspects of a license e.g. Start Date, End Date, System Restrictions etc.. In example I have an restriction in a license, which says you cant create more than 5 user accounts. I have a Method e.g. bool NumberOfUsersIsCoveredByLicense, which calls an common method e.g. bool IsValidLicense. IsValidLicense would check if the license file is manipulated, expired etc. p  pThe problem right now is the erroroutput. As you can see I have methods with a bool return value, so I know there was a license violation, but I dont know which part of the license check failed. So Im thinking about, how to return a value, which describes which part of the license was violated. The easiest way would be to return a string value, I would do something likep  precodevar licenseValidationResult  NumberOfUsersIsCoveredByLicense4 iflicenseValidationResult.EqualsString.Empty      Success  else      ErrorMessage  GetErrorMessageByErrorCodelicenseValidationResult  codepre  pSo if the license is valid I would return a empty string, if its invalid it would return the errorcodes in a form like error1error2error3.. Im actually not sure, if this is a good soulution. Another possibility would be a enumeration, something like thisp  precode[Flags] public enum LicenseErrorCodes      None  0x00,     LicenseExpired  0x01,     LicenseManipulated  0x02,     MaxNumberOfUsersReached  0x04,     [...]  codepre  pBut again, Im not sure if this would be a nice solution. Is there any common waybest practice to solve such a problemp

Negative 7003 pExcuse me for the title, but I just do not know if this particullary has some name I could have used, just let me know or edit the title with whatever is better.p  pNow, the question I have two MySQL tables, one contains a list of items, each item has a unique ID and a title stored. The other table is a list of users. Both tables get more values every day more users register and more items are added. I would like to save which items each user has already seen, I just need to know if he has or he has not seen a particular item. So, how should I store something like this, what would be the best way I only thought about having a column on my users table with a string containing comaseparated IDs of the items. But ideally I would need a way that would allow me to do the next thingsp  ul liGet a list of all the users that checked an item.li liGet a list of all the items checked by some user.li liGet a list of all the items that an user has not checked.li liGet a list of the items that not any user has checked.li liGet a list of the items that all the users have checked.li ul

Negative 7003 pI have an issue that I can reproduce.  I can see what the issue is but for the life of me I cant figure out how to correct it.  FIrst, let me explain the view structure.  p  pThe root View Controller for the window is a TabBarController.  TabBarController contains two views, NavigationController 1 nav with its root view contrller set as a UITableView and NavigationController 2nav2 with its root view controller set to a UICollectionView.  Here is how that is all setup in the AppDelegate p  precode WTATableView tv  [[WTATableView alloc] initWithNibNameWTATableView bundlenil]  UINavigationController nav  [[UINavigationController alloc]   initWithRootViewControllertv]  nav.tabBarItem.title  NSLocalizedStringBirthday List, nil  nav.tabBarItem.image  [UIImage imageNamedbirthdaycake]   WTACollectionViewController cv  [[WTACollectionViewController alloc]  initWithCollectionViewLayout[[UICollectionViewFlowLayout alloc] init]]   UINavigationController nav2  [[UINavigationController alloc]     initWithRootViewControllercv] nav2.tabBarItem.title  NSLocalizedStringBirthday Grid, nil nav2.tabBarItem.image  [UIImage imageNamedpackage]  UITabBarController tabController  [[UITabBarController alloc] init] tabController.viewControllers  [nav, nav2] self.window.rootViewController  tabController [self.window makeKeyAndVisible] return YES codepre  pThe CollectionView subscribes to a notification that is posted by an entry view controller and takes the data returned in the notification UserInfo dictionary and updates the UICollectionview by calling the data source methods.  Here is that codep  precodevoidhandleNotificationNSNotification notification      [self.birthdays addObject[notification userInfo]]   NSLogCalling handle method  if[self.birthdays count]  1     [self.collectionView reloadData]  if self.birthdays.count gt 1       NSLog Number of itmes in section B d, [self.collectionView  numberOfItemsInSection0]        [self.collectionView     insertItemsAtIndexPaths[[NSIndexPath indexPathForItem   self.birthdays.count 1  inSection0]]]     codepre  pSo on the first Tab Bar item that contains nav with its root controller set as a UITableView, if I tap the NavBarButton to show the modal view controller and get the user entry and then dismiss the modal controller to return to the UITableVIew, I get the new table entry.  If I then tap on the tab Bar item that contains nav2 with its root controller as the UICollectionView and then back to the UITable tab bar item, I can continue to add as many entries as I want, no problems.  BUT, if I dont navigate to that tab bar item containing the uicollectionview and try to add a second entry from the uitableview, I get a crash every single time, Invalid number of items in section.p  pI can see that if I dont navigate to the uicontroller tab, the data source methods for the uicontroller are never called.  It is like the UICollectionView is not being initialized until I navigate to the tab bar but I know it is because I NSLog out the init methods and view did load methods when the app first starts up.  I thought this might have something to do with uicollectionview being wrapped in the nav2 controller so I took that away and I ge the exact same behavior...  I feel like I am missing something here that is causing me a lot of grief...  ANy suggestions would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 7003 pImagine I have, lets say, a 3d model of a worm created in Blender. This worm model consists of three segments a head segment, a middle segment and a tail segment, each of which is controlled by a single bone. Now what I want is to be able to scale those segments inside my application and thereby change the length of the worm by using something like this p  precodemiddleBone.scaleX1.5 codepre  pOf course, I could create an animation in Blender that does what I want, but than I would need a single animation for each scalevalue and also, I would need an codeAnimationControllercode, although I dont really want to animate something, but just change the scale of a single part of my worm permanently. So, is there any way to access a single bone inside my libGDX game Or is there any better way to solve this problemp
Negative 7003 pI need to couple my application with its database. To do this, Ive generated an entity with codedoctrinegenerateentitycode.

Is it possible to log the list of functions the program is hitting and provide a snapshot of the variable when it hits at the specific point. I am trying to place breakpoint at many places and trying to print the information of the variable. Is there a easy way to do that like an extension or plugin or macros.. p  pI tried to search for macros, but I dont find that under tools. Seems that for VC they dont provide that option either...p

Negative 7003 pNice simple question, no sql code needed, just your knowledge regarding precedence.p  pIn one of my common table expressions I have 5 unions, in the SELECT statement there are three columns, Col1, Col2 and Col3 Example. All three of these fields have a CASE WHEN statement on them but with varying operators and conditions Its why I have so many UNIONs, as if two WHEN statements are TRUE, SQl server will pick the first one so Im appending the additional rows if another condition is TRUE. Below is an examplep  precodeSelect CASE WHEN a.Co1ltgtb.Col1 THEN a.Col from Table A UNION     Select CASE WHEN a.Co1b.Col1 THEN b.Col from Table A     UNION    Select CASE WHEN a.Co1ltgtb.Col1 THEN a.Col from Table A     UNION   Select CASE WHEN a.Co1ltgtb.Col1 and col3  A Value THEN a.Col from Table A     UNION    Select CASE WHEN a.Co1b.Col1 and col3  A Value THEN a.Col from Table A   codepre  pAre there limitations and pitfalls I have to be aware of Since I was already caught of guard with CASE statements having more than one TRUE outcome. I also know that in UNIONs only the first referenced col names are used. I ask, because my values I get are not adhering to the CASE statement so Im wondering if having multiple cases on the same col across multiple union statements is conflicting or problematic for SQL Server to resolve. I figured, that each query between the UNIONs will simply just append if a record is receive, well... heres hoping.   p

Negative 7003 pIm developing a Windows Phone 7.1 app and I have a ScrollViewer with an ItemsControl inside it, where each item in the ItemsControl contains two TextBoxes.  When the user taps a TextBox on the lower half of the screen to enter a value, the screen usually scrolls up so that the onscreen keyboard doesnt cover up the focused TextBox.  However, in my app this only happens about 50 of the time.  The other 50, the keyboard still comes up but the screen doesnt scroll up and the focused TextBox gets covered by the onscreen keyboard.p  pSince it doesnt always happen and I cant reliably make the problem happen or prevent it, Im guessing that theres some kind of race condition occurring between 2 threads involving updating the layout or something.  Just a guess.p  pIs there a method I should be calling in the TextBoxes GotFocus events to ensure that the autoscrolling when focusing on a TextBox will work  Maybe something similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14795865scrollingisdisabledlimitedwhenkeyboardispoppedupinwindowsphone75this other questionas answerp

To not lose my previous notes, I want to write a script that makes the update process, this way   If the most recent sheet has a new row which isnt in the previous sheet a new student row, it add this row to the new sheet    If the old sheet has a row which isnt in the new sheet, it change the color of that row and adds a note Transferred student or something like that.p  pI get this sample code, but Im wonder if there isnt a better way to do this.

Negative 7003 pPlease i am stuck in a project i am working on, So i really need your suggestions on how to solve it. This is my problem. I am designing a system where users can make a post and other users can follow the post either by commenting on the post or by clicking on a follow post button. When a comment is made on the post i want to notify all the topic followers that user X added a comment to the post you comment on or user Y added an answer to the Question you added an answer to. The approach i thought of implementing this was to create a notification table with  id thepostID  useraddedpostid  topicfollowerid  themessage  readboolean  then i will run a loop through an array which i will generate containing all the ids of the users following the post, then run an insert for each of the users. When the user loads his page i run a query selecting from notification table where readfalse, an once the user reads the message i will mark it as read. The run a con job every 2 days to remove notifations read and that is older than 24hours. p  pNow my challenge is this.. i might have a post followed by more than 4000 users, so if i should notify this users on a user comment to the post, the user will have to wait for than 30 senconds to contnue which is a seriouse kill for my site.p  pPlease how can i excecute this logic when a user comments on a post and still allow the user to continue with whatever he is doing. Is there a way to run this in the background considring the fact that PHP does not support Multi threading.p

One as a SVN and the other as a GIT rep.  Say that you have multiple checkin for different users  user A, user B, user C on the GIT repo.  When you merge over from the GIT to SVN repo, all the files get retagged with the user that does the merge.  Lets say its user C that does that merge.  ALl the files will be associated with user C instead of the original author.  p  pThere are tools that does the merge like SmartGIT or even tortoiseGIT, however they dont account for multiusers.  p  pIs there any solution out therep  pAny advice appropriated, Thanksp

Negative 7003 pFor my 2D Topdown shooter i want to combine my character subclass of ImageActor and the weapon TextureRegion or Actor he is holding just for optical reason. My character inside holds a Hero object, which represents his logiacl part, like his weapons, his selected weapon and his speed. The weapons he holds are also only the logical part, so no graphics in there. How should i add this weapon to the player Should i use a Group and the player and the weapon are part of that group Or should the player draw the weapon in his draw method, depending on his own position But then i would have to keep the weapon texture inside the player and load the one which is matching to the weapon the hero object is currently holding. What would be the best wayp

Negative 7003 pIm working on an extension that opens multiple models simultaneously. Models can be opened and closed dynamically. Models are opened as a codeLiteWorkspacecode so that widgets and such are displayed. Whenever you create a new codeLiteWorkspacecode, it starts up a codeJobThreadcode and codeLifeguardcode. The problem is that shutting down a codeGUIWorkspacecode the parent class of codeLiteWorkspacecode doesnt kill its codeLifeguardcode or codeJobThreadcode.p  pPossible solutionsp  ol lipThe ideal solution would be a to have all models share a codeJobThreadcode, as this would remove number of threads as a cap on how many models one can run. Doing this would have certain performance benefits as well. Is there a chance this is a possible This solution still require being able to kill codeLifeguardcode.pli lipNext would be to be able to kill the threads of course.pli lipAs a last resort, we could keep around a pool of codeGUIWorkspacecodes. When the user closes a model, its thrown back into the pool. Then, when the user loads a new model and theres something in the pool, we just reuse one of those codeGUIWorkspacecodes. This would allow us to open the same number of models as with 2. The only downside is that opening a new model like completely new, from the file menu or whatever still doesnt kill the threads, so theres this permanent resource baggage hanging around. We actually might have to institute a pool anyway for performance reasons, but it would be really nice to actually be able to free up the resources at some point.pli ol

Negative 7003 pI have an algorithm that stores elements in boostptrvector. It is important for the algorithm that once allocated pointers to elements would not change until ptrvector is destroyed. On the other hand I need to sort ptrvector. I assumed may be naively that since regular stdsort swaps elements it will simply swap the order of pointers inside of ptrvector without new and delete. On the other hand I see in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9697339isthisthecorrectwaytosortptrvectorthis posta indications that sorting ptrvector may actually change element pointers. Can someone confirm that reallocation actually happens Is there a way to avoid itp

Negative 7003 pIm in desperate need of help. Im trying to analyze where my incoming traffic is coming from.p  pI have a facebook app with 100.000 users and a lot of new organic sign ups each day. I see a lot of fluctuations in the sign ups 50 and Im desperate to figure out where the inflow is coming from.p  pIve gone through facebook insights and found that 99 of the external referrers are coming from my own app and lt0,5 is coming from various google engines.p  pI can see that a big boost initially came in when the app was trendingnew and Ive had a few peaks since with no apparent reason for it. Hence I have a hypothesis that it has something to do with the lists  but I really need help in how to confirm this.p  pHas anyone had the same frustrations as I  and more importantly what did they do about it Do I need to setup some form of landing page where I capture the source address Is there a online service like google analytics which can help me outp  pAny help or direction is appreciatedp

Negative 7003 pI am building a system that contains consultant profiles. In this system, each consultant can choose which certifications he or she has. Right now I am expanding the system to contain titles when a consultant has a certain set of certifications. The interesting tables isp  precodePersonstores ID, Firstname etc. of a person  Certificationstores ID, Name of a certification  PersonCertificationstores PersonID and CertificationID as a linking table name   Titlestores the title ID, Shortname and Fullname  TitleCertificationsstores which certifications is needed for a title codepre  pAs an example, say we have a title with ID 1 called MCSA. The certifications required for this title is certifications with ID 1 and 2. TitleCertificationstable could look like thisp  precodeTitleID  CertificationID 1        1 1        2 codepre  pIf a consultant has both certification with ID 1 and 2, he or she would be granted the title MCSA with ID 1. If the consultant does not have any of the certifications, he does not earn this title. p  pThe problem I have is that I do not know how to check if the user has all the requred certifications that is defined in the TitleCertificationstable. i have started with this, but it lacks any check against if the person has all certifications that is needed. p  precodeSELECT t.Fullname FROM Title t JOIN TitleCertifications tc ON t.ID  tc.TitleID JOIN PersonCertification pc ON tc.CertificationID  pc.CertificationID codepre  pThe result of the query above will yield the titlename for each rows with a match on certification, as an example it will yield two rows if a user has two of the three required certifications to gain a title. p  pDoes anyone know how to write a query that will match the required certifications and only give an answer if the user has all the required certifications for a title p  pI am using a SQL Server 2012 using TSQL in Azure if that matters. p  pSorry for writing kinds of fuzzy, I am not sure about all the terms in English. p

Negative 7003 pI am trying to do parameter tuning of my learning model on a Bright compute Cluster, which requires a large number of jobs due to the number of parameters being tuned. Each combination of the parameters requires around 162 qsub jobs. And there are around 50 combinations of parameters that I require to check. This is equivalent to running around 16250  8100 jobs. However there is a 350 qsub job limit per account on the cluster that I am using. I was hence wondering whether there was a way in bash scripting to check the number of currently active qsub jobs so I could effectively automate the process of initiating new jobs.p

Negative 7003 pI have a 3D triangulated mesh which is similar to a curved piece of paper in that it has a 4 edges and lives in 3dimensional space. Edges may be different lengths and curve differently, but it could theoretically be continually morphed to look like a piece of paper. A uv coordinate has been assigned to every vertex and the range of u and v is between 0 and 1. Some vertices are obviously on the border. For the bottom border u is in the range [0,1] and v is 0. Top border vertices have u within [0,1] and v  1. The left and right borders have u  0 or u  1 respectively with v within [0,1].p  pNow think about the isocurve where u  0.5. This would be the line or collection of line segments from bottom to top of the middle of the surface.

How would I get therep  pI strongdontstrong want to implement this by putting data through a renderer OpenGL, etc. Im sure there must be a standard method.

Negative 7003 pThe definition of the method on developer.android.com simply says that the method returns the unique device ID, for example, the IMEI for GSM and the MEID or ESN for CDMA phones.

Negative 7003 pThis question isnt about how it can be done, but rather how it should be done.p  pIm implementing a program that creates a decision tree. There are different ways the tree can be constructed, so I have a static variable type that is assigned in the main function. In the Node class constructor, I have a switch statement that checks the value of this type variable and does something accordingly. p  pI want to know the best way to handle the case in which the value does not match any of the preset options the default case. This should be impossible and will probably never be executed, but I want to do it right nonetheless. If this case does happen, I want it to print a message and terminate the program.p  pI know I can do it by simply throwing an error there and catching it the main, but it doesnt seem intuitive for something that should never happen.

Negative 7003 pWhat is the security impact on first request while using https for Java clientp  pIn webapplications, the first request is a url like a hrefhttpsxyz.abc.commyapplogin relnofollowhttpsxyz.abc.commyapplogina This request itself will ensure that https connection is ready. We then send the credentials on https using POST and we can be sure that the request will not be intercepted as the https is already connected.p  pIn the case of a java client connecting to Web Service, I can directly make the very first request as a POST request along with user credentials to a https url like a hrefhttpsxyz.abc.commyserviceloginservice relnofollowhttpsxyz.abc.commyserviceloginserviceap  pWill the POST body of this first https request be confidential Will the https handshake be completed before the request body is sent  If this is not the case, then should we use a dummy https request to first establish the connection and then make a second request with the credentialsp  pThis is related to my other question here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24411228securingrestwebserviceusingtokenjavaSecuring REST Web Service using token Javaa p

I can also do them manually, one by one, but this would cost me a terrible lot of time.li ol  pWhen I had a similar question for counting the tweetids per tickerstring, somebody else suggested using the followingp  precodeSELECT d.date, coalesceIBM, 0 as IBM, coalesceGOOG, 0 as GOOG, coalesceBAC, 0 AS BAC FROM dates d LEFT JOIN  SELECT DATEcreatedat AS date,          COUNTDISTINCT CASE WHEN processedtext LIKE TICKERIBM then tweetid                END as IBM,          COUNTDISTINCT CASE WHEN processedtext LIKE TICKERGOOG then tweetid                END as GOOG,          COUNTDISTINCT CASE WHEN processedtext LIKE TICKERBAC then tweetid                END as BAC   FROM tweets   GROUP BY date   t  ON d.date  t.date codepre  pThis script worked perfectly for counting the tweetids per tickerstring. As I however stated, I am not looking to find the average classified scores per tickerstring. My question is therefore Could someone show me how to adjust this script in such a way that I can calculate the average codeclassifiedcode scores per tickerstring per dayp

Negative 7003 pIm in the midst of creating fairly nuanced popover using Bootstrap and jQuery. I am using jQuery for the addition and removal of rows within the popover. The problem that I am facing involves the institution of functionality with a click event that I have tied to some linked text. I need to be able to reveal a specific hidden row if it is hidden, or propagate a new row if the aforementioned specific row is shown. I have tried two variations on getting this to work with close results. p  pThe first shows the hidden row successfully if hidden, but if shown, the clone within the else statement never occurs p  precodedocument.onclick, .additional, function event        if .hiding.parent.parent.hide             .hiding.parent.parent.show        else            .roweq3.clonetrue.insertAfter.rowlast         codepre  pbr The second allows for the addition of the nonunique rows and hiding of the unique row however, when the unique hidden row is shown, a cloned nonunique row propagates as well simultaneously.

Negative 7003 pI am typing a math document in Russian using Emacs 24.3.1 and AUCTeX 11.87. I am using the coderussiancomputercode input method to type Russian. It would be very convenient to disable this input method inside math delimiters such as code code so that inside formulas I automatically switch to typing English without pressing kbdCtrlkbdkbdkbd. For example, I could type    Consider the formula , put the point between the parentheses and start typing codeforallcode. Currently, I would be typing codecode, but I would like Emacs to recognize that I am inside a formula and switch off the Russian input method.p  pI suspect that this can be done using codepostselfinserthookcode and codetexmathpcode from AUCTeX, but I am not sure if this is the most elegant method.p

However the information on how to properly configure a Rails app for suburis is scattered across many layers of the technology stack and it is difficult to find a constellation of settings that provides consistent behavior.p  h1configurationsh1  ul liapachepassenger config based on a hrefhttpswww.phusionpassenger.comdocumentationUsers20guide20Apache.htmldeployingarackbasedrubyapplicationincludingrailsgt3 relnofollowhttpswww.phusionpassenger.comdocumentationUsers20guide20Apache.htmldeployingarackbasedrubyapplicationincludingrailsgt3a  code RackBaseURI suburi ltLocation suburigt RackEnv production SetEnv RAILSRELATIVEURLROOT suburi ltLocationgt codeli licodeconfig.assets.prefixsuburicode  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8828472rails31assetpipelinewithsuburisRails 3.1 asset pipeline with suburisali licodeconfig.relativeurlrootsuburicode or codeENV[RAILSRELATIVEURLROOT]suburicode  a hrefhttpedgeguides.rubyonrails.orgconfiguring.htmldeploytoasubdirectoryrelativeurlroot relnofollowhttpedgeguides.rubyonrails.orgconfiguring.htmldeploytoasubdirectoryrelativeurlrootali licodeRails.application.routes.defaulturloptions[scriptname]  suburicode  a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsrailsissues6933 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrailsrailsissues6933ali ul  pAnd several others from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7295744howtodeployrails31appinasubdirectoryHow to deploy Rails 3.1 app in a subdirectoryap  ul licodemap suburicode in config.ruli licodescope suburicode in routes.rbli licodeRailsBaseUricode not codeRackBaseUricode as mentioned above  is this simply old info, or still relevant for Rails 3.2.17Passenger 3li ul  h1contextsh1  pI have tried each of these methods in three different contextsp  ul liRails webrick coderails scode  a hrefhttpexample.com3000suburi relnofollowhttpexample.com3000suburia or a hrefhttpexample.com3000 relnofollowhttpexample.com3000a emifem all the assets and urls still workli liRails running under ApachePassenger using codeRackEnv developmentcode  a hrefhttpexample.comsuburi relnofollowhttpexample.comsuburiali liRails running under ApachePassenger using codeRackEnv productioncode  a hrefhttpexample.comsuburi relnofollowhttpexample.comsuburiali ul  pIn every permutation Ive tried, different things work and different things fail.p  pFor example, in one permutation, assets are served from assets... while the rest of the app is served from suburi...  In others, suburiassets are served, except for fonturl references from the sass files generated by rails I might add.  Those references seem to still use assets... as if the variables setting suburi arent used consistently between the erb helpers and the sass helpers.p  pMany, many times too many to count actually we get something working with webrick, only to have it fail in passenger deployment.  Or we get it working under Passenger in development to only have it fail in production.  There seem to be a lot of emmagicem variables at different levels of this technology stack and very few comprehensive guides as to how to stitch everything together successfully.p  h1solutionsh1  pIm looking for a constellation of settings from the above references that provides consistent behavior under the three contexts Ive provided.p  pThe perfect solution would allow all three contexts to run exactly the same, with nothing broken meaning assets work correctly, fonts work correctly, plugins from other gems and vendor assets work correctly, especially when crossreferencing files with standard Rails url helpers like fonturl, etc.p  pAn adequate solution would enable the Passenger deployed apps to work equally well whether codedevelopmentcode or codeproductioncode i.e. we would rather not get rudely surprised by gems andor other jscss solutions we add in that seem to be working fine in development that dont work in production.p  pA minimal solution would enable all these pieces to work only in production.p  pIt is also useful to know if the consensus is that the desired behavior cannot be achieved in Rails 3.  In that event we will likely back out from using the asset pipeline.p

Negative 7003 pI have some relational data in a SQL Server 2008 database split across 3 tables, which I would like to use to populate some classes that represent them.p  pThe hierarchy is Products  Variants  Options.p  pI have considered passing back 3 result sets and using LINQ to check if there are any relatedchild records in the related tables.  Ive also considered passing back a single denormalised table containing all of the data from the three tables and reading through the rows, manually figuring out where a productvariantoption begins and ends.  Having little to no prior experience with LINQ, I opted to go for the latter, which sort of worked but required many lines of code for something that I had hoped would be pretty straight forward.p  pIs there an easier way of accomplishing thisp  pThe end goal is to serialize the resulting classes to JSON, for use in a Web Service Application.p  pIve searched and searched on Google for an answer, but I guess Im not searching for the right keywords.p

Negative 7003 pI work on a C project including tons of third party libraries, using Visual 2012. We have two main platforms  two game consoles, using the same CPU . Our project links in 3.5seconds on one platform, and in 75seconds in the other one. After analysing, the huge difference is because some third party libraries are build with GL. In the final link, because of that, the linker automatically switch to LTCG mode to produce real x86 code. and thats a long process.p  pMy question is there any way, work around, hack, to rebuild the third party library WITHOUT GL so it will contain classic x86 code to speed up the final link time Obviously without requiring the source codep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7003 pIm trying to iteratively loop through subsets of an R df but am having some trouble. dfA contains values from 01000. Id like to subset the df based on each unique value of dfA, manipulate that data, save it as a newdf, and then eventually concatenate rbind the 1000 generated newdfs into one single df.p  pMy current code for a single iteration no loops is like thisp  precodedfA  1 dfA1 lt subsetdf, A  dfA  some ddply commands on dfA1 altering its length and content  codepre  pEDIT to clarify, in the single iteration version, once I have the subset, I have been using ddply to then count the number of rows that contain some values. Not all subsets have all values, so the result can be of variable length. Thus, I have been appending the result to a skeleton df that accounts for cases in which a certain subset of df might not have any rows containing the values I expect i.e., nrow  0. Ideally, I wind up with the subset being fixed length for each instance of A. How can I incorporate this into a single or multiple plyr or dplyr set of codep  pMy issue with the for loops for this is that the length is not the variable, but rather the unique values of dfA. p  pMy questions are as follows 1. How would I use a for loop or some form of apply to perform this operation 2. Can these operations be used to manipulate the data in addition to generate iterative df namess e.g., the df named dfA1 would be dfAx where x is one of the values of dfA from 1 to 1000. My current thinking is that Id then rbind the 1000 dfAxs, though this seems cumbersome.p  pMany thanks for any assistance.p

For examplep  precode1 ... 2 ... 2 ... 3 ... 3 ... 3 ... 4 ... codepre  pThen it gets transformed and 99.9 of the keys stay in the same order in relation to one another and 99 of the remainder are close. So the following might be the output of running the map task on the above datap  precodea ... c ... c ... d ... e ... d ... e ... codepre  pThus, if you could make sure that a reducer took in a range of inputs and put that reducer in the same node where most of the inputs were already located, the shuffle would require very little data transfer. For example, suppose that I partitioned the data so that ad were taken care of by one reducer and eg by the next. Then if ad could be run on the same node that had handled the mapping of 14, only two records for e would need to be sent over the network.p  pHow do I construct a system that takes advantage of this property of my data I have both Hadoop and Spark available and do not mind writing custom partitioners and the like.

Basically they say the followingp  blockquote   pVerifying Releasesbr   It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP and MD5 signatures. MD5 verification ensures the file was not corrupted during the download process. PGP verification ensures that the file came from a certain person.br   The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the Apache Derby KEYS as well as the asc signature file for the particular distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate trusted source  the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using ...br    pgpk a KEYSbr    pgpv dbderbyX.Y.tar.gz.ascbr   orbr    pgp ka KEYSbr    pgp dbderbyX.Y.tar.gz.ascbr   orbr    gpg import KEYSbr    gpg verify dbderbyX.Y.tar.gz.ascbr   To verify the MD5 signature on the files, you need to use a program called md5 or md5sum, which is included in many unix distributions. It is also available as part of GNU Textutils. Windows users can get binary md5 programs from here, here, or here.br   We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.  p blockquote  pFirst I dont understand which strongKEYSstrong file I should download, the one they refer me to, or the one after I download the relevant apache Ant or Derby.br Second  what is the strongascstrong signature file Where can I find it  p

Negative 7003 pI have an old lib created by old binutils. I cant link this lib with my new binutils there was a bug in the my old binutils that caused functions names to stay as they compiled no prefix was added instead of adding the prefix  e.g. function name foo should become foo after compilation and after assembly should be foo. My assembler got emfoo and didnt add the em prefix to be foo so I got linker errors. Anyway I decided to disassemble the lib and reassemble it. Is there a simple way to do it  I tryedp  precodeobjdump d .libgcc.a gt libgcc.d codepre  pand than p  precodeas .libgcc.d o libgccnew.o codepre  pbut got a lot of errors... I know that there are a lot of information in the disassemble file that couldnt be parsed by the assembler. So, is there a flag to strip all the irrelevant information so assembly will work p

this accessibility script provides. p  pThe script is designed to allow nonsighted users using screen readers i.e. JAWS to be able to tab around the menus and screen items based on what JAWS is

Here are the detailsp  pI have two activities, a SplashActivity which retrieves data from a server using a AsyncTask and passes the data to my MainActivity. In my MainActivity, I get this data and pass it to a fragment named SummaryFragment. I have a few fragments and a navigation drawer in my MainActivity. The first visible fragment is the SummaryFragment which reads the data passed to it from the MainActivity and consequently draws a graph. p  pWhen the app starts, there might be no active Internet connection, in that case, in my summary fragment I ask the user to enable WiFi. What I want to do is to refresh this SummaryFragments view after the user comes back to the app after enabling WiFi. What I do right now is that in the onResume of my MainActivity, I check if the SummaryFragment in visible, and if so, I start the SplashActivity again and close the current activity. SplashActivity must fetches the data like it does when the app starts and start the MainActivity fed with the fetched data which loads the summary fragment and shows the graph. p  pThe problem is that it strongtakes a considerably long time 3040 secondsstrong after the app is resumed to go from the SplashActivity to the MainActivity and show the graph meanwhile the users sees the splash screen, whereas when the app starts it takes 12 seconds to do so. Before using the current solution redirecting user to the SplashActivity, in MainActivity.onResume I tried using the same AsyncTask class that I am using in the SplashScreen to fetch the data and show the summary fragment afterwards, but the result is the same, there is a significant delay.p  pThe following code is my MainActivitys onResumep  precodeFragment fragment  getVisibleFragment if fragment instanceof SummaryFragment      Intent intentSplashActvity  new Intentthis, SplashActivity.class     Log.dTAG, about to start the splash activity     startActivityintentSplashActvity      close current activity     finish     super.onResume     return  super.onResume codepre  pThe SplashActivityp  precodepublic class SplashActivity extends ActionBarActivity      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitysplashscreen          new PrefetchDatathis.execute              codepre  pThe PrefetchData p  precodepublic class PrefetchData extends AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Voidgt      String serverResponseJson  null     private String data1  null,                    data2  null,                    data3  null      private SplashActivity mSplashActivity  null     private MainActivity mMainActivity      public PrefetchDataActivity sourceActivity         if sourceActivity.getClass  SplashActivity.class              mSplashActivity  SplashActivity sourceActivity                      Override     protected Void doInBackgroundVoid... arg0          JsonParser jsonParser  new JsonParser         try              if CaratApplication.isInternetAvailable                  serverResponseJson  jsonParser                         .getJSONFromUrlhttpaURL                       catch Exception e              Log.dSplashActivity, e.getStackTrace.toString                  if serverResponseJson  null ampamp serverResponseJson                try                  JSONArray jsonArray  new JSONObjectserverResponseJson.getJSONArrayarrayName                   Using Java reflections to set fields by passing their name to a method                 try                      setFieldsFromJsonjsonArray, 0, data1                     setFieldsFromJsonjsonArray, 1, data2                     setFieldsFromJsonjsonArray, 2, data3                  catch IllegalArgumentException e                   catch IllegalAccessException e                                catch JSONException e                                return null           Override     protected void onPostExecuteVoid result          super.onPostExecuteresult          if mSplashActivity  null              Intent intentMainActvity  new IntentmSplashActivity, MainActivity.class              if gotDataSuccessfully                  intentMainActvity.putExtradata1, data1                 intentMainActvity.putExtradata2, data2                 intentMainActvity.putExtradata3, data3              else                  intentMainActvity.putExtradata1, Constants.DATANOTAVAIABLE                 intentMainActvity.putExtradata2, Constants.DATANOTAVAIABLE                 intentMainActvity.putExtradata3, Constants.DATANOTAVAIABLE                           mSplashActivity.startActivityintentMainActvity              mSplashActivity.finish                 codepre  pIn MainActivity, upon selection of the summary entry in the navigation drawer, I initialize the SummaryFragment, and then replace it using a fragment transaction strongreplaceFragmentmSummaryFragment, mSummaryFragmentLabelstrong.

Negative 7003 pWhile searching for a performanceproblem in a Javawebapp, I would like to profile via sampling a single web session. The webapp is deployed on a Java EE ApplicationServer either JBoss or WLS, so no OpenJDKspecific stuff possiblep  pUsing a traditional sampler like JVisualVM or YourKit will only allow me to profile all running threads at once and thus will not reveal the CPUUsage of said websession separated from the baseload, which is already on the server. Part of the problem is, that there is obviously no technical connection between websession and a single thread, i.e. every request might get a different thread out of the threadpool of the applicationserver.p  pMy idea is to implement a sampler and register the thread associated with the observed websession every time a new request is received from the server deregistering the thread, as soon as the request is finished.p  pFirst question Do you have to do this by hand or is there a tool already available to do it for youp  pSecond question as Ive found none and assume that this is a rather specific problem Whats the best approach p  pObviously one would try to minimize impact of the profiling to the applicationperformance. Also obviously, as I need to connect the technical thread info to applicationspecific data websessionID, this appears to be nothing, which can be done via JVMTI. p  pLeaves the option of coding a inappprofiler, where a thread is doing the sampling via Thread.stackTrace or ThreadMXBean.getThreadInfo. Which is better Is there another, better optionp

Negative 7003 pIve tried to find a solution at stackoverflow but cant seem to find one quite like mine so here it goes. I have a computer in the lab that is connected to various devices like pantilt units, cameras, and light sensors and has all their drivers installed. I have C code on the lab computer that knows how to talk to the hardware. The C code can set an exposure time, ask for a picture, get one back, and display it in a picture box. I can tell the pantilt to move to a location and have it respond when done. If I am in the lab, it all works just the way I want.p  pThe problem is that I want it to feel like I am at the lab computer when I am really at another computer. Most likely, I will be running the code that is on the non lab computer from inside Visual Studio. The program running in the lab will not be running from Visual Studio. With Remoting, this is a piece of cake. Put the code that talks to the hardware into a class, use MarshalByRefObject along with an interface I create, add RegisterWellKnownServiceType and presto I can use GetObject to get a reference and control it like I was sitting at the computer in the lab. So I know that remoting will work.p  pHowever, remoting is being phased out for WCF not to mention its not real safe out in the real world. It appears to me that WCF is going to make a local copy by value of the remote object which means it will not be on the lab computer and therefore unable to interact with the hardware that is attached. Someday this lab computer and all the sensor equipment is going to be moved away and I will have to access it remotely using the internet. A couple of years ago I did this exact thing but I was using remoting. Since remoting is so insecure, how do I do this without using remoting Does WCF not have something equivalent to MarshalByRefObject If WCF only uses by value, then it seems like they are phasing something out without providing functionality to replace it. Is there a way to use remoting that is not insecure Is there something else besides WCF I should usep  pThis may be long winded but I see lots of people get dinged for asking questions that arent very clear so I am trying to be clear. If there is already a post that truly provides me the best answer to my question, I must first apologize for not finding it myself but ask that a link be provided so I can get the answer there.p

Negative 7003 pI am creating an application that uses a combination of Tornado Web Server and Symfony.p  pThe tornado part uses sockets and queries a database every 1000ms and checks to see if it is different than what is currently stored in the cache sort of like redis or memcachep  pIf there is anything different in the key value pair then it triggers a javascript query to deliver new information to the symfony application and triggers a jquery ui dialog to say Hey its your turn and then waits for input from the user to change the mysql database and then it starts the whole process again and sends the Somethings Changed message to the other user.p  pThe issue that I am having is sometimes the dialog does not trigger because it is receiving a Somethings Changed message that is blank.p  pI think what is happening is because Symfony and Tornado are both manipulating the database the Somethings Changed message is firing before the dialog pops up in the Symfony Appp  pWhat I am trying to do is figure out a way to know if a specific jquery dialog has been opened during an update and if it has not been opened send a message to update again.p  pOne idea is to do a database update in Tornado with a random number then when the dialog opens set that cookie to that random number. If the cookie matches the database entry then that means the proper dialog has been seen. If it does not match then trigger the push update again.p  pAm I way off base here Is this theory even close to the way to do itp  pThis is the last part of my application and it works 8 to 9 times out of 10p  pANY ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 7003 pI have a compsci lab in which we must complete the text adventure game World of Zuul. To do this we had to complete several steps such as creating more rooms, creating an items class, and adding items to rooms. The final step is to add a Teleport room to the game. Here is the text from the project sheetp  blockquote   pImplement a teleport room that has an entrance but no exit.  The   short description is in a room with blank walls and no obvious exit.   When you perform the look command in the teleport room, there is a 75   chance that you will just stay in the teleport room and see the   description above.  There is a 25 chance that you will teleport   randomly into one of the other N rooms and then you will see a   description of that room.  You will need to think about reorganizing   the relationship between the Room class and the Game class to make   this happen.p blockquote  pI cant figure out how to do this.

The problem Im facing is that the coloured div needs to overflow a container div. p  pIm talking about the blue part. The yellow lines indicate the container div. The blue div on the right actually is as long as on the left, so it spans the width of the page.

Negative 7003 pWere using a webprogram that uses ajax and jquery and the like Netsuite. I want to change something on a page and have tried to use document.ready and window.load to get an external script loaded on the page. Ive tried to load the external script in the head and body.. but the contents arent written. The external file looks for a specific div id and then prepends some code to that. It never works, because the page itself loads dynamically and the div Im looking for loads when the rest of the page is done. So window.load, etc. never work...p  pAt last Im in the program itself that loads parts and pieces and am trying to simply write the external script file in there. Now this time the external file has a simple document.write in it, so its straightforward. In other words, the script is in the middle of html code in the body of the page. I know this is a terrible way of doing it, but Ive got to try something to get this to work....p  pAccording to firebug, it writes the external file where it should be check and firebug shows me the contents of that file check, but ... it never writes it onto the page...p  pThe file just contains thisp  precodedocument.writeltdiv idshpblk styleborder2px solid ffa500borderradius7pxcolor000066margin5pxpadding5pxtextalignleftgtltimg border0 width12 height12 srcimagesiconsstoreiconexclamation2c.gifgtHazardous conditions blahblah...  Potential delays and disruptions can be anticipated.ltdivgt codepre  pWhat am I missingp  pEdit some more clarification is necessary...p  pSituation I have to be able to put a piece of html on the page every now and then that creates a message.p  pEnvironment What I have is a page that loads a header and footer first which are set up in separate files and then it takes a second or so to load the rest of the page. From what I understand, this rest of the page is written in a certain code, similar to javascriptjquery.p  pWhat I CAN do is edit the files for the header and footer and put javascript in there to make modifications to the rest of the page. I can access some of the files that contain parts and pieces of the rest of the page, but this is a huge pile of spaghetti.p  pWhat Ive tried Since I want to be flexible with the html that I need to put into the page, I preferably would like to create a piece of javascript or html or whatever on another site and have the environment pick up that code. I can do this with javascript or iframe. But since its a secure area https, I thought it would be best to use a javascript file instead of an iframe. So....p  pI created the javascript file and tried it out in a normal environment where I knew for sure it would work.. and it works like a charm. But when I tried this in the before mentioned environment, I am running against a wall...p  pThe javascript file has document.ready jquery statement in it and it would prepend the html div to an existing div on the page. This way it would load the page and write the page.. easy as pie.p  pHowever.. since the header and footer load first which includes the external script file, and then the rest of the page, SOMEHOW the div where the script checks for DOES NOT EXIST YET. So I tried window.load instead of document.ready. Same result. Now, it WOULD appear ONLY when I refresh the page. So there may be a way to have it refresh the page, but I only want this as the absolute last attempt.p  pSo then I tried to see if I could go around this by changing the script so that, instead of using a document.ready it would just do a simple javascript document.write statement. Then I call the script in the middle of the body of the page I put it in one of the files that load in the middle of the page. I know this is not something I would do normally, but wanted to try it out anyway. So.... I would have something like thisp  precodeltdiv idblock1gt   ltdiv idblock2gtstuff hereltdivgt   ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpssomeotherdomain.cominclude.js gtltscriptgt   ltdiv idblock3gtstuff hereltdivgt   ltdiv idblock4gtstuff hereltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pNow when I run this, I do not get any errors, but nothing is being done with the contents of that js file. In firebug it shows me the contents of that file though.. so I assume its being read. But I have no idea why it doesnt run.p  pAgain.. back to normal practices Ive tried window.load, because this would run the statement after the page loads, HOWEVER.. like I said before, I have the feeling it builds the contents of the middle of the page through this somehow and my script runs before this it cannot find the div block3 where it would prepend to. Whenever I stop running the page at my script, the div its depending on doesnt exist yet...p  pI hope this made sense...p
Negative 7003 pI have been trying to figure out how to fix some shift reduce conflicts I have. I have looked around and found different topics on fixing it but it seems like no matter what I do I just cant seem to find a way to fix these issues.p  pI am trying to write a grammar class for Angel Script a popular scripting engine I got the BNF grammar from the parser class. You can find the language reference here a hrefhttpwww.angelcode.comangelscriptsdkdocsmanualdocscript.html relnofollowhttpwww.angelcode.comangelscriptsdkdocsmanualdocscript.htmlap  pAnd within my class for each rule I addde a comment of the BNF grammar Im trying to copy. At the moment I dont actually use the keywords I define. I will go back and try and clean it up once I can get it working without conflicts. Here is my class a hrefhttppastebin.comFydCTqmU relnofollowhttppastebin.comFydCTqmUap  pYou should be able to just create a Dll and run that with the grammar explorer and youll see all the errors. It seems like most of the errors all come from the same issue so I think maybe once I can get that fixed it will fix almost everything.p  pEDIT Here is the main issue. That is the main script state, I know its broken up into a lot of different rules but I did that so I could try and fix the issue which I still havent had luck with.p  pEDIT I tried condensing my code to hopefully get passed the reducereduce errors but it seems to stay exactly the same but only looking way more cluttered. If anyone can help me get it right ill be more then happy to send them a few hundred dollars via paypal. Im at the point of just giving up its been over a week Ive been on this.

Negative 7003 pIm trying to do a segmentation task on the below picture.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgF6SM.jpg altorignal imagep  pIm using fuzzy cmeans with some minimal preprocessing. The segmentation will have 3 classes backgroundthe blue region, meatthe red region and fatthe white region. The background segmentation works perfectly. However meatandfat segmentation on the left side of the photo maps lots of meat tissues as fat. the final meatmask is like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0cnmG.jpg altmaskp  pI suspect thats because of lighting conditions which makes the left side brighter so the algorithm classifies that region as fatclass. Also I think there could be some improvements if I could somehow make the surface smoother. Ive used a 6x6 median filter which works alright, but Im open to new suggestions. Any suggestions how to overcome this problem May be some kind of smoothing Thanks p  pEdit 1 The fat areas are roughly marked in the below photo. The top area is ambiguous, but as rayryeng has mentioned in the comments, if it is ambiguous for me as a human, its alright for the algorithm to misclassify it too. But the left hand section is clearly all meat and the algorithm assigns a big chunk of that as fat. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDVhIn.jpg altrough fat segmentsp

When it boots up, a a hrefhttpwww.atmel.comImagesAtmel1112132bitCortexA5MicrocontrollerSAMA5D3Datasheet.pdfpage64 relnofollowhardware bootloader see page 64a loads a 64k software bootloader that I wrote into sram.

This is true on startup, but I remap the memory as soon as my       bootloader starts up.  note This 2 stage bootloading process is necessary because the Atmel hardware bootloader       can only load programs up to 64k, and it can only load programs to sram.  My        firmware is over 64k and needs to be loaded to ddram, so the Atmel hardware       bootloader loads my own bootloader to sram, and my own bootloader loads my firmware        application code to ddram. codepre  pI want to compile and link my application code into an .elf file so that 2 program segments are created.

Any ideas how to make that first example work on mobile Chromep

Negative 7003 pSo Ive got a strange behavior happening in my ASP MVC View logic. I know its not the best practice to have logic in a view, but that surely couldnt be causing this anywaysp  pIve got a foreach loop that loops through a collection, displaying the total cost, the original value, and the amount saved. But with the following code, the VALUE variable is wrong, but the Total and Price Adjusted are right.p  precodeforeach var option in Model.ProductAttributes.Single.Values    ltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classsmall5 columnsgt       lth3gtoption.Namelth3gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classsmall2 columns textcenter costColgt       lth3gtltstronggt var total  option.Cost  option.PriceAdjustmentValue.ToStringCtotalltstronggtlth3gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classsmall2 columns textcenter savingsColgt       ltulgt         ltligtValue  var value  option.Cost  option.PriceAdjustmentValue.ToStringCvalueltligt         ltligtSavings option.PriceAdjustmentltligt       ltulgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classsmall3 columns textcentergt       lta href classbuttongtBuyltagt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt   if option.Equalslast       lthr classnoTopMarginHr gt     codepre  pSo Ive debugged what is happening, and for some reason, in the value line, option.Cost is being added by option.PriceAdjustment and THEN minused. So for instance, if my cost was 80, and my PriceAdjusted was 40, then the Value would come up as 160, and not 120. p  pIf I change the value line top  precodeltligtValue  var value  option.Cost  option.PriceAdjustmentValue  option.PriceAdjustmentValue.ToStringCvalueltligt codepre  pThen it works fine, but this just seems so wrong.p  pWhat is going on here What am I missingp
Negative 7003 pIm sure this has been answered, but for the life of me I couldnt find the answer.p  pIf I have two tables grewords and grelink.  The greywords table has columns id, word, definition and the grelink table has columns wordid, difficulty.p  pBasically, after each question, an entry goes into grelink with the words id and a difficulty 0 if correct, 1 if wrong.p  pSo I now want to generate a list of the top 5 hardest words.p  pI think I need a MySQL SELECT statement with a nested statement with the AVG function on the difficulty column.  How do I do thisp

So if, for example I need to delete Columns J and L, the table would look like thisp  precode        A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J     1   Y   T   T1  T2  T3  T4  T5  T6  T7  T9       2   19  1                                            3   13  2   19                                       4   14  3   13  19                                   5   16  4   14  13  19                               6   17  5   16  14  13  19                           7   16  6   17  16  14  13  19                       8   20  7   16  17  16  14  13  19                   9   10  8   20  16  17  16  14  13  19               10  20  9   10  20  16  17  16  14  13           11  11  10  20  10  20  16  17  16  14  19       12  11  11  11  20  10  20  16  17  16  13       13  14  12  11  11  20  10  20  16  17  14       14  15  13  14  11  11  20  10  20  16  16       15  17  14  15  14  11  11  20  10  20  17       16  10  15  17  15  14  11  11  20  10  16       17  4   16  10  17  15  14  11  11  20  20       18  15  17  4   10  17  15  14  11  11  10       19  6   18  15  4   10  17  15  14  11  20       20  10  19  6   15  4   10  17  15  14  11       21  16  20  10  6   15  4   10  17  15  11       22          16  10  6   15  4   10  17  14       23              16  10  6   15  4   10  15       24                  16  10  6   15  4   17       25                      16  10  6   15  10       26                          16  10  6   4        27                              16  10  15       28                                  16  6        29                                      10       30                                      16   codepre  pAnd now the regression would be with inputs Y A11A21 because the first entry in the last column of the table 19 in cell J11 is in row 11 AND The last entry in the first column of the table 16 in cell A21 is in row 21. Likewise the X input would be B11J21 for the same reasons.p  pI have tried in a hundred different ways, but no luck.
