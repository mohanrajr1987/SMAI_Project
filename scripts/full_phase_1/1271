Positive 1271 pI have a script that parses DNS info in a certain file. The code looks like this and expects 2 instances of the line from the dump file. p  precodenxdom1stgrep resulted in NXDOMAIN pathtmpnamed.stats.tmp  awk  print 1   grep m1  nxdom2ndgrep resulted in NXDOMAIN pathtmpnamed.stats.tmp  awk  print 1   sort n  grep m1  codepre  pThen, below another command in the script tells it to subtract the resultsp  precodeif [ nxdom1st   ] then     nxdomain0 else     nxdomainexpr nxdom1st  nxdom2nd codepre  pProblem is, the dump file eventually contains 4 lines for resulted in NXDOMAIN, 2 for the actual DNS zone and 2 from localhost, and the script cant handle it so I get no results. For instance, when the dump file contains a pattern like thisp  precode             [localhost.localdomain]              [155.168.192.inaddr.arpa]              20 queries resulted in NXDOMAIN              20 queries resulted in NXDOMAIN codepre  pIn this example the lines with 20 are causing the problem because they are from a local service I emthinkem that is querying itself. Hence the localhost.localdomain which always appears before the problem lines. On the server I dont want to disable queries to itself using localhost, so how can I modify the script to discard results if the lines above what its looking for contains [155.168.192.inaddr.arpa] or [localhost.localdomain]p  pBelow is the file dump that the script parses. Unfortunately, right now there have been no queries to localhost, so you will not see what I posted up above.  The localhost.localdomain and the [155.168.192.inaddr.arpa] lines are present, just no queries picked up on these 2 stat dumps. Again, this problem only occurs when there are queries listed under these 2 lines, which is why I was wondering if I could modify the grep string in the script to exclude any resulted in NXDOMIAN results that may occur directly after. Something like, if resulted in NXDOMAIN is seen within 10 lines below localhost.localdomain, ignorediscardetc..p  precode Statistics Dump  1443199511 [id.server view bind] [authors.bind view bind]

Positive 1271 pI have a script written in bash, with one particular grep command I need to modify.p  pGenerally I have two patterns A amp B. There is a textfile that can contain lines with all possible combinations of those patterns, that is xxxAxxx, xxxBxxx, xxxAxxxBxxx, xxxxxx, where x are any characters.p  pI need to match ALL lines APART FROM the ones containing ONLY A.p  pAt the moment, it is done with codegrep v Acode, but this is a false track, as this would exclude also lines with xxxAxxxBxxx  which are OK for me. This is why it needs modification. p  pThe tricky part is that this one grep lies in the middle of a multiplypiped command with many other greps, seds and awks inside. Thus forming a smarter pattern would be the best solution. Others would cause much additional work on changing other commands there, and even would impact another parts of the code.p  pTherefore, the question is is there a possibility to match pattern and exclude a subpattern in one grep, but allow them to appear both in one linep  pExample A file contains those linesp  precodefooTHISfoo fooTHISfooTHATfoo fooTHATfoo foofoo codepre  pand I need to match p  precodefooTHISfooTHATfoo fooTHATfoo foofoo codepre  pa line with THIS is not allowed.p

When I scanned the table for the missing entries I found one line in the file where it seems R failed to interpret the separation patterns t and n for a bit.p  plook at line 4825 in the datasetp  precodeShootAnnot[4825,] codepre  pfor some reason, the sixth cell in that line contains a big chunk of data, with many complete lines and the appropriate t and n cell and line separation patterns all in one cell. Then it suddenly jumps back into separating cells and lines correctly. I have got a bunch of these files, so I would like to make sure I can resolve any issues like that automatically. Any ideas what might be causing thisp  pThanksp

As far as I can tell the asp.net page is working fine, it makes it through the few new lines of code without an issue the wav file is generated.  The few lines of speech code causing the issue is done well before the timeout.  p  pIt seems like the asp.net page was actually sending some sort of acknowledgement back to the classic page which is no longer getting sent.  I should also point out that the speech code was throwing an exception saying it needed to be asynchronous which I fixed by adding Asynctrue to the .  However, it works when asynctrue, its just those speech lines that break it.  The problem code is justp  precodeSpeechSynthesizer speaker  new SpeechSynthesizer             speaker.Volume  100             speaker.SelectVoiceByHintsSystem.Speech.Synthesis.VoiceGender.Female, System.Speech.Synthesis.VoiceAge.Adult, 0             try                              speaker.SetOutputToWaveFilectestoutput.wav                          catch Exception ex                              retVal  false                          speaker.SpeakmsgText             speaker.SetOutputToDefaultAudioDevice codepre  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on what could be wrong or what I could use to help debug this  p

Negative 1271 pI have to create a serverjava  clientc system, both server and client will have to work with objects data types wich are the same for the client and for the server, for example a car object will be created on the client side and then send to the server where aditional calculations will be done on the car object. What i would like to do is to create one universal implementation of the car object and than use this implementation within the server and the client. First i  thought about creating a dll in c with all data types wich are same for the client and the server, but this solution has a drawback. Because this solution only works under Windows OS and i have to support Win,Mac,Linux. So is there a multiplatform solution for my problem  p  pI give my thanks to all your replyes.p

Negative 1271 pIm looking at starting a new web app which needs to be secure if for no other reason than that well need PCI Payment Card Industry accreditation at some point.p  pFrom previous experience working with PCI on a domain, the preferred method is to use integrated windows authentication which is then passed all the way through the app to the database using kerberos so the NT user has permissions in the DB. This allows for better auditing as well as objectlevel permissions ie an end user cant read the credit card table.p  pThere are advantages in that even if someone compromises the webserver, they wont be able to glean anymuch additional information from the database. Also, the webserver isnt storing any database credentials beyond perhaps a simple anonymous user with very few permissions for simple website configp  pSo, now Im looking at the new web app which will be on the public internet. One suggestion is to have a Active Directory server and create windows accounts on the AD for each user of the site. These users will then be placed into the appropriate NT groups to decide which DB permissions they should have and which pages they can access.p  pASP.Net already provides the AD membership provider and role provider so this should be fairly simple to implement.p  pThere are a number of questions around this  Scalability, reliability, etc... and I was wondering if there is anyone out there with experience of this approach or, even better, some good reasons why to do it  not to do it.p  pAny input appreciatedp

For instance, you could use plm to do fixed effects, or you could create a matrix with the appropriate dummy variables and then run that through glm. In a case like this, however, it is annoying to generate the dummies yourself and it would be easier to have plm do it for you.p  pAbielp

Negative 1271 pTL DR Want some Java help with connecting to a truly local database  no access to server tech , or if you can whip up code, that will work.

See EDIT2 for more specificity.p  pEDIT Before anyone says JDBC I looked through the tutorials  started reading in depth , but most of it seems to be geared towards server tech, which I have no access to.p  pEDIT2 Seems most the answers so far are requiring an installation of some kind which I unfortunately cannot do  and failed to mention, so I apologize .

Currently Im using ActiveX scripting to work with the database in a HTML Application .HTA file works only with Internet Explorer, I would really like to make this more cross browser  in the event the company EVER switches to an actual browser  by using JAVA to access the database, then output the results in JSON to a local variable JavaScript can call and make use of.p  pHonestly would rather tutorial type information as I want to actually learn why this works so I can later modify it to suit my needs. I have Eclipse installed as well as JDK, and can right small programs in Java, so not completely brain dead  but not far from P . Ive been working with JavaScript so I can read quite a bit of Java code as it stands  not the same syntax since they are not related, but the little I do know of Java I can translate back to JS without problem .p  pAnyway, any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I can continue developing with ActiveX  as I know that works on the system and Im 99 sure they will continue using Internet Explorer, but, would like some flexibility .p

Negative 1271 pLooking for a bestpractice advicep  pLets suppose I have a Account object with limit attribute. Each day there can be n Payments, with sum of their amounts up to the account limit. When creating a new payment, it checks to see if its amount  amounts of other payments of the day are still within the account limit, and either saves the record or displays error.p  pNow, lets assume I have account with limit 100, and simultaneously two payments of 99 are being created. Each would do a select, see that nothing is there, and proceed to save itself, resulting in 198 total being saved. p  pWhat would you do about this I was thinking about issuing a write lock on the payments table at the start of transaction, but that seems quite heavyhanded, seeing that I only really care about not allowing payments belonging to specific account not being read by other transactions. Are there any other options, better ways of handling this situationp

Negative 1271 pI have a class that is only ever accessed externally through static methods.

What is codedeptkeycode purpose herep  h2Edith2  pOk, seems it is a way to define the name of the constraint youre adding to the table. My next question is why dont you just call it the same name as the primary key column From what Ive seen it seems Oracle by default just creates a random name for the constraintp  pThanksp
Negative 1271 pWhat is better approach to update html content of some window on pagep  p1 I can use html template of that window, and when I need to change data described there I simply generate real html and replace old one with new. In this case I have to send from server side both html page with first data for search engine I cant fill this data on clientside, and also html template so I need to keep them synchronized. Window has tabs, so template will be not that small. Another pitfall I want to avoid  memory leaks  If some elements will leak, in case of template and replacing html content all the time memory will be eaten quite fast of course until we find that leak and fix it p  p2 I can make javascript object, which will save links to DOM elements with changeable contentp  pcodemyWindow.name  document.getElementByIditemnamecodep  pOverall I need to cache links to about 20 DOM elements. And when new data comes I do the followingp  pcodemyWindow.name.innerHTML  newNamecodep  pIn this case I dont need to have template and if something leaks, it wont be so noticeable for enduser, cause this structure will be not changed until page reloading, but probably this structure takes some memory, and each time when I use innerHTML browser will reflow. Also it is possible to avoid saving links in object, but look up DOM structure all the time when content is changing  p  pcodedocument.getElementByIditemname.innerHTML  newNamecodep  pbut this code will take time to find DOM element each time, thats why I decided that caching would be better. Also maybe using innerTexttextContent properties will not cause reflow Im not sure about it...p  pSo whats better Template  JavaScript Pointers p

Negative 1271 pI have thousands of SGML documents, some wellformed, some not so wellformed.  I need to get at certain ELEMENTS in the documents, but everytime I go to load and try to read them into an XDocument, XMLDocument, or even just a StreamReader, I get different various XMLException errors.  p  pThings like [ is an unexpected token..  Why  Because I have a document with DOCTYPE likep  precodeltDOCTYPE RChapter PUBLIC LSCDTD R Chapter for AuthoringEN [] gt codepre  pand I have learned that the [] needs to have something valid inside.

Is a SAX parser the right way  I basically want to open the document, go right to the element I want without worrying what might or might not be wellformed nearby, pull the data, and move on.  Should I just forget parsing with XMLDocument, XDocument, and just do simple string replacements like p  precodestr.Replacelthardhypengtlthyphengt,  codepre  pand then try to load it into one of the XML parsers.

Negative 1271 pSo Im building a program that features the use of the IKImageBrowserView component as a subview in an NSWindow. As a side note, I have a controller object called strongImageBrowserControllerstrong which subclasses NSWindow and is set as the delegate of the NSWindow object of my app. p  pI have sent IKImageBrowserView the message setCanControlQuickLookPanelYES to enable it to automatically use the QuickLook functionality to preview image files when the IKImageBrowserView is a first responder to receive key events. Then it took me a while to figure out how to make the IKImageBrowserView a first responder which I finally got working by overriding acceptsFirstResponder inside my strongImageBrowserControllerstrong.p  pNow I understand that as the delegate to the NSWindow, strongImageBrowserControllerstrong has a place in the responder chain after the event gets triggered on NSWindow. And I understand that as a subview of NSWindow, IKImageBrowserView is in line to be passed events for event handling. What I dont get is where the connection is between the strongImageBrowserControllerstrong being a first responder and the event somehow making it to the IKImageBrowserView. I didnt set NSWindow or IKImageBrowserView as first responders explicitly. So why isnt it necessary for me to implement event handling inside my strongImageBrowserControllerstrongp  pstrongEDITstrong So after reading the accepted answer and going back to my code I tried removing the acceptsFirstResponder override in my strongImageBrowserControllerstrong and the QuickLook functionality still triggered just like the accepted answer said it would. Commenting out the setCanControlQuickLookPanelYES made the app beep at me when I tried to invoke QuickLook functionality via the spacebar. Im getting the feeling that my troubles were caused by user error of XCode in hitting the RUN button instead of the BUILD button after making changes to my code emsighem.p

Negative 1271 pIs there any way to remove the timezone component from a Java Date object that is being returned from a web servicep  pFor example I have a start Date of 12AM.  I want that to be used as 12AM local time of the clients.  p  pI think that if the soap message doesnt have a timezone component then the local timezone is used.  There are 2 other options that I have weighed which would be either doing arithmetic on the date on the client side which I really really do not want to do or creating a new date class that holds the day, month and year as integersI dont need the time information.  The latter option would require substantial refactoring so if there is a way to just chop off the timezone info in the soap message that would be preferable.p  pThe client is written in .NET so if there is a way to change the how the date is interpreted on the client side that would achieve the same goal i think.p

Negative 1271 pI am starting a project using Qt. I am trying two approaches to get a View to do some of the following. This question involves the approach of inheriting from QTreeView.p  pI like what QTreeView does. I just want some added features.p  pFirst, what I want is to make a hierarchy tree view that will allow me to see categories containing other categories, the further right the columns go the more specific they are until it gets to the most specific. The metrics are shown on the row containing the most specific column. The view rows containing each generalized column will be bold and contain a summary of each metric, calculated by the model or view. The metrics will be in the model on each row in terms of the most specific column.p  pFor example, consider a model with the following data the last 3 columns containing numbersp  pCountryProvinceStateCountyParishCityTownPopulationPerCapitaIncomeWalMartsp  pSo my view would look similar to thisp  precodeCountry ProvinceState CountyParish CityTown Population PerCapitaIncome Walmarts  USA                                           250000000           42000     2354          Alabama                                 9000000           23000      153                         Barbour                    15324           19032        1                                      Eufaula         6520           23000        1          Tennessee                              14000000           29000      299                         Hamilton                   70000           41000        4                                      East Ridge     23000           32000        2 codepre  pSecond, I need it to work with QSqlTableModel. I have seen it show the model before, but it doesnt have any way to create the rows by a heirarchy, similar to above. That was going to be my second modification.p  pThe third reason is bold headers are only an option if you have the sort turned on viap  precode viewgtsetSortingEnabledtrue codepre  pWhen sort is on, the bold headers only works for the higherup rows and then turns off on lower ones. I want to fix that bug.p  pThe QTreeViewdrawRow virtual method looks to be all I need to override to accomplish the first challenge and perhaps the third. The second challenge dealing with QSqlTableModel, Im not so sure about.p  pAnyhow, I built a simple class inheriting from QTreeView with a generic ctor and dtor that just calls the QTreeView methods. As for drawRow, however, I ran into the following problem. The QTreeViewdrawRow function starts out like thisp  precodeQTreeViewdrawRow     QPainter painter,     const QStyleOptionViewItem ampoption,     const QModelIndex ampindex const     QDconst QTreeView   QStyleOptionViewItemV4 opt  option   const QPoint offset  dgtscrollDelayOffset   const int y  option.rect.y  offset.y   const QModelIndex parent  index.parent   const QHeaderView header  dgtheader   const QModelIndex current  currentIndex   const QModelIndex hover  dgthover   const bool reverse  isRightToLeft   const QStyleState state  opt.state   const bool spanning  dgtspanning   const int left  spanning  headergtvisualIndex0  dgtleftAndRight.first   const int right  spanning  headergtvisualIndex0  dgtleftAndRight.second   ... codepre  pThe function relies on have QDconst QTreeView run succesfully and return d, an instance of the QTreeViewPrivate class which contains important info related to layout and the remainder of the function. Since I am inheriting into my CustomTreeView class, CustomTreeViewPrivate will have to be defined and instantiated first if I am to run QDconst QTreeView in CustomTreeViewdrawRow.p  pIs creating this private class really necessary to inherit and make significant changes What is the benefit of inheriting here if all I can do is some perfunctory processes and then call the QTreeViewdrawRow to do the actual drawingp  pI want to change how its drawing.p

Negative 1271 pHow do you do this See my code example belowp  precode voidmethodA      ...     UILabel label1  [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrameframe]     ...    voidmethodB       label1.text  Label 1  codepre  pstrongEDITstrong Why Im wondering this is because I can not set an instance variable to the class. Because I will not strongknowstrong when the class loads how many codeUILabelcodes I will need. It will be a different amount each time the class is loaded. So I will need to dynamically create these UILabels in a method and then be able to access these labels throughout the rest of the class in a convenient way.p

Negative 1271 pI am developing a compressor and the result are bytes ASCII 0255 that I want to display in a TextArea GWT, so that people can copy the compressed data and paste it as the value of a variable in their Javascript code. For examplep  precodevar salnj  alnj is the compressed code that they copied from the Text Area codepre  pThe problem is that I cannot see some of these bytes I just see like rectangles, and I am afraid people cannot copyamppaste them successfully. What do you recommend me to solve this problem Change the charset utf8 Generate a JS file with the variable and the compressed codep  pThanksp
Negative 1271 pIm looking at using a nice Javascript chart library like highcharts www.highcharts.com or D3 httpmbostock.github.comd3.  These generate SVG or similar types of exhibit.p  pThis is all very well for the browser, but Id like to send people a summary email with some of these charts embedded.  Presently I use a c console app that generates the HTML, embeds the images which are either picked up from the file system or rendered into memory by a server side chart control in.p  pMy question is, to avoid recreating every chart on both server and client side, how could I get that client rendered image back into my c codebehind to attach to an email  Is this in any way possible  Would I need JSONp  pThanksp

Fallback is to use the ROOTURLCONF          as defined in the settings.py file.         try             hostname  request.META[HTTPHOST]             request.urlconf  settings.URLCONF[hostname]         except KeyError, AttributeError             pass          return None codepre  pThis seemed to work at first, but then I became aware that some kind of caching must be happening.p  pWhen starting the server and requesting site A, it would show up.

Negative 1271 pIm currently working on classifying images with different imagedescriptors. Since they have their own metrics, I am using precomputed kernels. So given these NxN kernelmatrices for a total of N images i want to train and test a SVM. Im not very experienced using SVMs though. p  pWhat confuses me though is how to enter the input for training. Using a subset of the kernel MxM M being the number of training images, trains the SVM with M features. However, if I understood it correctly this limits me to use testdata with similar amounts of features. Trying to use subkernel of size MxN, causes infinite loops during training, consequently, using more features when testing gives poor results.p  pThis results in using equal sized training and testsets giving reasonable results. But if i only would want to classify, say one image, or train with a given amount of images for each class and test with the rest, this doesnt work at all.p  pHow can i remove the dependency between number of training images and features, so i can test with any number of imagesp  pIm using libsvm for MATLAB, the kernels are distancematrices ranging between [0,1].p

Negative 1271 pI am making Scouting Software in Java for my a hrefhttpwww.usfirst.orgroboticsprogramsfrc relnofollow titleFirst Robotics Competition Official WebsiteFRCa robotics team. Scouting is like collecting data on other teams robots during competition. It is absolutely critical that my program makes that process as simple and easy as possible. My program can save its data in two ways, one of which is by writing a .scout file to the users hard drive. All this is working well, but as a finishing touch i would like to implement a way to associate .scout files with my program so that .scout files are opened with my program. Its like .docx for Microsoft Word. It associates .doc.docx...etc to itself such that when the user clicks on a file with those extensions, Word opens itself up and then opens the file the user clicked on. I want something like this for my application. Keep in mind, it is written in Java and meant to work on different operating systems Windows, OSX, Ubuntu Linux, etc. p

Negative 1271 pI have a form with two different UserControls  one that contains a Telerik RadGridView and the other that that contains a Telerik DataForm.p  pThe grid usercontrol is bound to a ViewModel that includes a property that exposes the Items collection that the grid is bound to.p  pWhen I bind the form to that property, everything works fine.br But I need to access additional info in the form control that really doesnt belong in the grid controls viewmodel.p  pSo I thought Id add a property to the form usercontrol, and bind it to the items collectionp  precodeltlocalFormControl xNameformControl     ItemsSourceBinding items gt codepre  pIn the forms codebehind, I added a normal propertyp  precodeprivate object itemsSource public object ItemsSource      get  return this.itemsSource      set  this.itemsSource  value   codepre  pAnd this didnt work, of course.  I got errors about having to use a DependencyProperty.  Which I thought was reassuring  the page was actually trying to bind to the property I thought it should.p  pSo I converted this to a DependencyPropertyp  precodepublic static DependencyProperty ItemsSourceProperty      DependencyProperty.RegisterItemsSource, typeofobject, typeofFormControl  public object ItemsSource      get  return GetValueItemsSourceProperty      set  SetValueItemsSourceProperty, value   codepre  pThat compiled and ran without errors.  Except, of course, that the controls viewmodel didnt have any items.  So next was to try to pass the ItemsSource property to the form controls viewmodelp  precodepublic FormControl      InitializeComponent     this.DataContext  new FormControlVMthis.ItemsSource     ... codepre  pAnd this didnt work.  ItemsSource was null when FormControl was constructed.  So I added a setItemsSource method to the viewmodel, and called it in the ItemsSource propertys set function. This didnt work, either. The xaml is apparently binding to the property, but it seems to do it without calling the propertys set function.p  pSo I decided to listen to the ValueChanged event, on the DependencyPropertyp  precodepublic FormControl      InitializeComponent     this.DataContext  new FormControlVM     DependencyPropertyDescriptor prop              DependencyPropertyDescriptor.FromPropertyFormControl.ItemsSourceProperty, this.GetType     prop.AddValueChangedthis, delegate              FormControlVM formControlVM  FormControlVMthis.DataContext         formControlVM.setItemsSourcethis.ItemsSource          ... codepre  pAnd its still not working.  The ValueChanged delegate never seems to get called.p  pThis seems like it should be a simple thing, but Ive not been able to find examples online, and Ive tried every combination I can conceive of.p  pAny ideas as to how I should handle thisp  p Additional info on the binding p  pWill was asking for info on the xaml that does the binding.p  pIf I put this in page that contains the user control, binding the user control to the viewmodel of the pagep  precodeltlocalFormControl xNameformControl         Grid.Column2         DataContextBinding         gt codepre  pAnd then this in the user control, binding the form in the user control to the itemsCollection of the pages viewmodelp  precodelttelerikRadDataForm         ItemsSourceBinding itemsCollection         HeaderView Item         CommandButtonsVisibilityNone         AutoGenerateFieldsFalse         gt codepre  pThen everything works fine.p  pBut the problem is that I cant bind the user control to the viewmodel of the page.  I need to have the user controls viewmodel expose information that the pages viewmodel should not be seeing.p  pAnd I cant have the form in the user control reaching outside of the user control, binding to a property on the pages viewmodel.  Its a violation of encapsulation, that will make using the user control on a different page much more complicated, and severely limit how I might modify the internals of the control in the future.  The page should not know anything about the controls within the user control, the controls within the user control should not know anything about the page.p  pWhen I include the user control on a page, I want to bind the user control to a property of the pages viewmodel, and I want any controls within the user control to bind to properties of the user control, or of the user controls viewmodel.p  pId think this was a fairly common occurrence.  But Ive not been able to find any examples of how it might be done.p

Negative 1271 pI have started to use classes implementing IDisposable to write blocks in streams, with the using statement. This is helpful to keep a correct nesting and avoid missing or wrongly placed startend parts.p  pBasically, the constructor writes the start of a block e.g. opening XML tag, Dispose the end e.g. closing XML tag. Example is the UsableXmlElement below its for large XMLs, so LINQ to XML or XmlDocument in memory are no options.p  pHowever, these IDisposable do not implement the sophisticated pattern recommended by Microsoft, with DestructorFinalizer, separate Disposebool method and GC.SuppressFinalize. Dispose simply writes the end element, and thats it.p  pIs there any down side to this, or is this a good way to maintain a correct nesting of elementsp  precodeclass UsableXmlElement  IDisposable      private XmlWriter xwriter      public UsableXmlElementstring name, XmlWriter xmlWriter              xwriter  xmlWriter         xwriter.WriteStartElementname           public void WriteAttributeltTgtstring name, T value              xwriter.WriteStartAttributename         xwriter.WriteValuevalue         xwriter.WriteEndAttribute           public void WriteValueltTgtT value              xwriter.WriteValuevalue           public void Dispose              xwriter.WriteEndElement       codepre  pUsage is like thisp  precodevar xWriter  new XmlWriter...  usingvar rootElement  new UsableXmlElementRootElement, xWriter     rootElement.WriteAttributeDocVersion, 123    usingvar innerElement  new UsableXmlElementInnerElement, xwriter             write anything inside Inner element      codepre  pResulting inp  precodeltRootElement DocVersion123gt     ltInnerElementgt        lt anything gt     ltInnerElementgt ltRootElementgt codepre

Negative 1271 pIn R, when saving a plot to a PDF or Postscript file, hyphens in axis labels get turned into minus signs. This, apparently, is by design.

Negative 1271 pI can see from Google searches that this question gets asked a lot, but none of the solutions I find are doing it for me. Im making a game in Java with images, you know, since games generally have that stuff. But the entire form is constantly flickering and I cant get it to stop. Yes, I have double buffered it and overridden the update method, and while that definitely helped, the flickering still persists. I dont know if Im doing something wrong with the double buffering, or if I need something completely different.p  pAt first I thought maybe it had something to do with the clearRect line, but upon removing it, the game still flickered but of course wasnt cleared each time. So that didnt help at all. Upon slowing down the timer the flickering does go away almost entirely, but I need to slow it down to 100ms and even then I still get some flicker. Besides, that is simply too slow for the game. I tried having one timer doing everything on a 10ms timer, with a separate one at 100ms for painting, but it just looks jumpy then. I can slow the painting timer down to about 30ms and have it still be smooth, though the flickering is still an issue.p  pThere must be a way of doing this every 1030ms without flickering. Is there some other method similar to double buffering but better in this case, or something I can use Thanks in advance for any help.p  precodepublic class main extends JApplet implements ActionListener      This Declares The Variables     Graphics2D buffer     Image offscreen     Timer timGame  new Timer10, this     other variables      public void init         This Creates The Offscreen Buffer Zone         offscreen  createImagegetSize.width, getSize.height         buffer  Graphics2Doffscreen.getGraphics         other initialization stuff irrelevant to drawing           public void actionPerformedActionEvent evt         if evt.getSource  timGame             runGame           private void runGame         Do stuff, move objects         repaint           public void paintGraphics g         super.paintg          buffer.clearRect0, 0, getSize.width, getSize.height         draw stuff to buffer         g.drawImageoffscreen, 0, 0, this           public void updateGraphics gr         paintgr      codepre

Negative 1271 pI am making a pretty abstract tree drawing system, but I am having quite a lot of trouble formalizing all the drawing features it should have. Id very much appreciate if someone could point me to things to read about this topic, because unfortunately my searches have been in vain.p  pI am looking fortrying to make a metalanguage for displaying trees. In these trees each node is an instance of a userdefined Object which have a userdefined graphical representation.p  pEach Object is associated with a Name, a graphical representation and has a finite number of childs  0 , which are only known to be Objects themselves. Object recursion is not allowed. Each Object may have userdefined Options that are used to trigger conditions which would change their graphical representation  in userdefined ways . Some Options are automatically applied, others may require user interaction  Would you like this Object to be A or B , thus explaining why Object trees need to be instanced.p  precodeObject     Name                 The Object Name     Childs               List of Object Childs         ContextName          The Name of the Child within this context         Types                List of Objects names. This child may be only one of them. Decided by the user during instancing.         Options              List of Options assigned to this child. Some of them may require user interaction, and apply other Options to the Childs childs.         Priority            This is an integer which is used to decide the order in which childs are drawn.     Symbol Name          The Graphical representation of the Object codepre  pOnce an Object Tree has been instanced, it has to be drawn without any addictional user input, and this is where I am having some trouble. The instancing of an Object tree assigns to each Object a particular graphical representation  lets call it Symbol . The assignment is however not known before the instancing. Different Objects may also have the same Symbol, which may be drawn differently depending on the Objects Options.p  pBecause of this, Symbols must be defined separately from Objects, and must have a series of abstract mechanisms to be able to draw themselves  and thir assigned childs  correctly, following the userspecified rules.p  pEach Symbol is represented by an image  or no image  plus a finite number of Attachments. Attachments are relative positions to the Symbols coordinates which tell the drawing code where to draw the Symbols of the Objects childs. Each one of them may have particular conditions to be used  e.g. this Attachment may only be used by a Symbol that has a particular Option, or if N Symbols have already been drawn, no collisions with already drawn Symbols etc etc .p  pThe algorithm has to find a free Attachment for each Objects child, following the order specified by their Priority. If it is not possible to find an Attachment for a Child the user may specify beforehand rules that allow some automatic retries, but if they also fail then the whole tree drawing fails. Some of these rules allow for adding addictional child Symbols andor assigning child Symbols to other childs  making them grandChildren  etc.p  precodeSymbol     Name     Main Image       Image Path, Height, Width     Attachments      List of the attachments, their position, requirements and addictional infos     Fail Rules       List of actions to do if it is not possible to successfully assign each Child to an Attachment codepre  pMy main problem is that the number of variables that a Symbol should be able to access is pretty high. Each Symbol, which Ill again remind should be defined using this metalanguage, should be able to access its child Symbols informations  not others to avoid deadlocks and circular referencing  for example the user may want the heigth and width of a Symbol to be equal to the sum of the heigth and width of all the Childs Symbols, or to use the same picture, and so on. This is also caused by the fact that the user writes Symbols rules independently from the final structure.p  pAt the same time, since the tree must be drawn from top to bottom, some of these informations may not be available from the start, and may require a great deal of backtracking.p  pAlso, since all of this has to be defined within a metalanguage which I have to be able formalize and parse, I have to define which are the functions that the metalanguage requires to allow the maximum grade of freedom to the languagewriting user without being overly complex  this is a vague limit, but essentially I dont want to have Tikz as a subset of my metalanguage . I am having however quite a bit of trouble identifying them.p  pAs I said before, I am looking for informations about this kind of topic andor methods for completing a project like this. Once Ill be able to fully complete the metalanguage I think I wont have too much trouble implementing the code to do all of this, my problems are for the most part theoretical.p

Negative 1271 pSo I am writing software that has to insert thousands of records into a Microsoft Access. Currently I am using an RBARrow by agonising row approach with JET. I wrote a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq120406071606972questiona on SO before asking how to speed up the process and was told to use DAO instead of JET as it would be much faster, and to avoid RBAR.p  pI am now in the situation where I am ready to implement a faster solution however, I have some further questions. Firstly something simple, does anyone know of a good tutorial for DAO syntax in vb.net as I have tried to look for one online but have struggled. Also does anyone know of a library to use insteadp  pSecondly what is the best way to avoid an RBAR approach to inserting data into a database. I assume that this is using a record set, but I am unsure how to go about implementing one of these, or the SQL query required to insert several rows at once.p  pFinally I was told before that msaccess was not the best thing to use a it is slow. Does anyone have any suggestions of a different alternative to access I would need it to be a free commercial license which I know is a stretch. I only use the database as store for the data I dont need any of the user interfacing that access provides. I found a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma292051606972questiona on SO about this which suggests SQLite, MySQL or FireBird.

Negative 1271 pWere supposed to create relational databases, not flat structures. You create tables with relationships to other tables. You normalize to remove duplication, and denormalize to improve performance. This all makes sense. But, Im having trouble finding a good mechanism to insert into a relational structure. Are there no good mechanism for inserting records into a relational structure. Is there something like p  pcodeINSERT INTO x LEFT JOIN y ON x.id  y.id VALUES...codep  pThe best I could come up with is a stored proc that doesp  precodeINSERT INTO x SELECT id FROM x or id INSERT INTO y codepre  pThis seems counter to the whole relational model... p  pIts the insert equivalent of not having joins.

Im having a little bit of trouble implementing the runtime methods and having been looking for source code for asynchronous transformations that use multiple inputs that I can use as a model for my own code.p  pDoes anyone know of available source code or have their own code theyd be willing to share with me to help get me on the right track Much appreciatedp
Negative 1271 pI am in a dilly of a pickle trying to join several files together into a master file. There are 5 files with same structure, and I can read each file individually into a data frame with no problems. I even manually set the column class for 200 variables rather than letting R decide, because I believed that was causing the problem. However, appending any two files together causes me to run out of memory.p  blockquote   pWarning messages   1 In rbinddeparse.level, ...     Reached total allocation of 4043Mb see helpmemory.sizep blockquote  pSo I did some experimenting I joined two different chunks of file 1 together. That works. I joined a chunk of file 2 to a chunk of file 1. That works. I joined a chunk of file 2 to the original file 1. That works.p  pEach of these files comes in at a little under 200MB so I am not sure that I should be running out of memory. If anybody is interested, the data comes from a hrefhttpwww.hearstchallenge.com relnofollowhearstchallenge.coma. The competition is long over, we are just using the data for an analysis experiment and not programming.p  pAny suggestions for how to solve thisp

As long as encryption and decryption routines use the same parameters to generate the keys, the keys are guaranteed to be the same. The class uses static functions with duplicate code to make it easier to demonstrate encryption and decryption logic.

Negative 1271 pI did a search and cannot find another question like this one. Im getting this error with Delphi XE2 and Delphi XE3. Im using Crystal Reports XI R1. Im not sure why Delphi would care about the version, the error would need to be during initialization of crpe32.dll. Im upgrading a Delphi 2006 app to XE3. Very little work required  the only barrier between me and success s this DLL error. Any insight would be appreciated. Many TIAs p  pBest regards, Brianp
Negative 1271 pI am creating a customer account page which displays the relevant information in the database and allows customers to edit their information.

Negative 1271 pI am developing an HTML5 game, primarily for iOS. It has a Node.js backend and uses a myriad of technologies, including jQuery, Socket.IO, and the Web Audio API. The game works fine.

Negative 1271 pLooking at a hrefhttpopensource.apple.comsourceobjc4objc4532.2runtimethe Mac OS X 10.8s version of the ObjectiveC runtime library source codea, I noticed that its got a a hrefhttpopensource.apple.comsourceobjc4objc4532.2runtimeNSObject.mmNSObject.mma file. As its name suggests, its got the codeNSObjectcode class implementation, as well as builtin autorelease pool and retain count implementations.p  pHowever, versions of the ObjC runtime library prior to Mountain Lions one didnt implement the codeNSObjectcode class they didnt have a codeNSObject.mmcode file, as you can see at the a hrefhttpopensource.apple.comsourceobjc4objc4493.9runtimeMac OS X 10.7s ObjectiveC runtime library source codea, for example.p  pSo does this really mean that the codeNSObjectcode class is now part of the ObjectiveC runtime library instead of being a Foundation library component If yes, why Is it to avoid one linking against the whole Foundation library with codeframework Foundationcode when subclassing codeNSObjectcodep

Negative 1271 pOk, I know its kind of weird, but I am trying to create a data driven panel that reconfigures itself based on a DataTemplate member that I have on a object.  Right now I am accomplishing this by using an ItemsControl bound against a dummy list of 1 bogus item so that I get a single instance of the data template.  It just seems silly to have to do this in an ItemsControl, but I cant think of anything that will use my DataTemplate without trying to do it against a list of items.  Anyone have any ideap  pJust for clarity, lets say I have a Widget classp  precodepublic class Widget     public string Name  get set     public DataTemplate MyTemplate  get set      public Listltobjectgt DummyList  new Listltobjectgt  new object    codepre  pand the Xaml something likep  precodeltItemsControl ItemsSourceBinding DummyList ItemTemplateBinding MyTemplategt codepre  pI can then create a collection of Widgets and populate each one with the correct data template based on the objects status.p  pAnyway, as I said, this works... Id just like to find a more elegant solution than using an ItemsControl if anyone knows of one.p
Negative 1271 pI am trying to extract from a series of strings which represents depth likep  precodefoobarx foobarbazx foobarbazx foobarlolx codepre  pWhere codexcode is a number I dont care about. Ive got as far as splitting on the codecode and looping through, at which point in PHP Id do something like check where in the loop I am using codefor i0 etccode and then use that to determine my depth to build an output array likep  precodeoutput[foo][bar]  1 output[foo][bar][baz]  2 output[foo][bar][lol]  1 codepre  pThe trouble is the depth is dynamic and might be either just 34 deep which I could just account for with lots of checks on the value of codeicode and handling them separately or say 10 or more deep in which case some kind of recursive function is probably best.p  pIve come across the issue that to have a string as an array index I need to use a dictionary, but you have to specify the types in the dictionary, meaning you need to know the depth in advanced correct me if Im wrong when instantiating a dictionary object.p  pI guess an attack might be something like calling a recursive function such that each time its called you pass codeicode to indicate the depth, then the function calls itself decrementing codeicode each time until it has built the portion of the tree from that input string but its what storage structures I use for that in C that I am not sure about.p  pThe final output will be a CSV that I can open as a spreadsheet to look likep  precodeFoo        0 Bar     1    Baz  2    Lol  1 codepre  pPerhaps one direction for a solution is to use a pure C Array and simply store the title e.g. codefoocode in there, keeping information out of array indicies, which is probably best practice anyway.

Negative 1271 pAll Im wanting to do is get the actual character that is pressed whenever they key is entered for the event.p  pThe only option Im seeing is codee.KeyCharcodewhich will give me the position rather than the character itself. p  pWhat Im wanting to do is limit the values of the key press to digits between 09. The way Im doing it right now is just codeife.KeyChar lt 48  e.KeyChar gt 57codep  pThis seems a bit cheap to just put in the values for 0 and 9, and Id love to know how to get the character value itself rather than its key.p  pEDIT Thanks for the input so in general is there no way to go from having the codee.KeyCharcodevalue to the value of the input itself.p  pId really like to take my event, e, and access the character pressed directly as opposed to using e.KeyChar to get a numeric representation of that value.p

How to do that I thought about finding the longest gesture in time. E.g. I have 3 gestures, first code1,2scode, second code1,4scode and third code1,5scode. So code1,5scode is the longest one. Now I want to apply  for each frame every 250 miliseconds 4 samples within a second. Because my longest gesture is code1,5scode long, so codeNumberOfStatesForHMM  1500ms  250ms  6 statescode  and this should be pretty optimalp  pIm not sure how should I define states for codeHMMcode If my idea above is correct, how to count transition probabilities when there are e.g. 6 states and one gesture ends after code1scode, so I analyze 4 states probabilities of transitions from states 4 to 5 and 5 to 6 are equal to 0.p  pI read a hrefhttpwww.waset.orgjournalsijeeev3v3326.pdf relnofollowTHISa paper, but Im not quite sure how to solve my problem...p

Negative 1271 pI have a testsuit as usual for Perl projects, containing a codelibcode and a codetcode directory. The tests in codetcode are structured through subdirectories. So I run them usingp  precodeprove Ilib r t codepre  pSo far nothing special, and afaik quite a standard way of testing in Perl.p  pSince it is the assumption, that this is the standard way of testing, Id like to make sure that the following appliesp  pemIf you run codeprove rcode on codetcode, you have tested everything that is there to test.emp  pThis is very important, since otherwise you can never be sure that you really called all the tests and the stuff is fine. Somebody calling the above would then maybe  not knowing so  just call a part of the available tests, leaving some behind. Quite annoying... tests that are not run, are of no help. It should be as easy and predictive as possible for developers to call all the tests It is a bad thing when you have to look up how to run the rest of the testsuit. You might not know about it, or might not do it anyway.p  pSo here comes my problem I have to integrate some Tests using a hrefhttppgtap.org relnofollowpgTAPa which kindly provides the tool codepgprovecode. Now I have to make two commandos to do the testing. Additionally to running codeprove Ilib rcode I also have to run something like e.g. codepgprove S schemacustomerX U dbuser d dbname tpgTAP.sqlcode. The problem is not that big if you call the tests automatically from codecroncode or what ever. But it really decreases the chance that we emlazyem developers run all test tests during our busy days.p  pSo I wonder what would be the best approach to implement the tests in such a way that codeprovecode will also include those tests. Is it, that I have to create some code.tcodefiles which wrap the whole thing and how Are there any tricks I can do with the whole codeHarnesscode stuff on CPAN Would a simple codetestall.shcode in the rootdir, including both commandos, do the best job, even if it breaks the assumptions I made abovep  pstrongSo my question in short isstrong Can I run all tests, including pgTAP with codeprovecode If not, is there a best practice for solving my problemp  pThanks a lot.p

In the MSysObjects table in Access, the ForeignName of the linked table is set to push.students. When I open the linked table, I can see the correct dataset from push.students. Anyone can helpp

Negative 1271 pSo I have a game for Mac OS X built in cocos2D.p  pIm using gestures to simulate keyboard commands to control my character and it works really well.p  pI submitted my game to the AirSpace store and it got rejected on the grounds that the Leap should be used to control my menus as well which is fair enough I guess.p  pThing is for the life of me I cannot figure out how this is done.

On the contrary, I even read that references are kind of aliases. So what do I misundertandp  pSo is it possible to define some variable aliases inside the same class I admit that with a simple class it doesnt seem very useful it is a question about the langage itself.p  pAlso I dont know C0x very much, so does C0x offers a solution for thisp  pstrongEDITstrong The comment of Marcino gives me another idea. You can take a function reference, so can I create a class member which is a reference on a class methodp

Negative 1271 pIm programming in Java to talk with a device connected to a comport connected to the PC through USB, but by an RS232 to USB cable in between.

Hoping that it would solve the issue I split the 400 ms sleep in two and placed the other sleep before serialPort.writeBytespollBuf. That doesnt help. Somehow the serialPort.writeBytes function just never returns and doesnt throw an exception either.p  pDoes anyone have a guess of what the failure might be Its not the stayConnected boolean as I never call the function yet that sets it so falsep  pedit Ive just added a counter and the program gets into the loop 283 and 285 times when I run it twice, thats pretty close and both around 2 minutes ...p

Negative 1271 pI have a game project that Im working on using the a hrefhttpunity3d.com relnofollowUnitya engine.  Its going to make use of a tool that Im developing separately to sell on the a hrefhttpswww.assetstore.unity3d.com relnofollowUnity Asset Storea.  I expect that Ill be updating the tool both based on user feedback and throughout development of the game itself.  Im looking for the best way to organize these projects with my version control setup to let me easily merge changes across the two projects.p  pIm storing these project in an SVN repository that I use TortoiseSVN to manage and Im not familiar enough with the more complex features to know the best way to organize the projects to allow me to easily update the tool from either place.  Im not sure if Branching or Checking it out to multiple locations is the right decision, or what other alternatives there may be.p  pIm currently thinking of setting something up where the tool is stored in the repo by itself, just the general code and Unity assets.  Then, setting up a small project that has additional assets for the Asset Store package Imported into a different project in the repo, into which I Check Out the original tools files.  Lastly, doing the same for the game itself, Checking Out the tool into its hierarchy.  I think this will let me make changes in either project, Commit any changes, then Update the other project to have them there as well.p  pIs this a good way to do this  Or a bad way  Is there a better wayp

Negative 1271 pI have a library based on NumPy with a few classes that overload the arithmetic operations.  The internals are a little hairy due to a significant amount of error checking, but Ive run across a serious problem with how Im doing it.p  pThe idea behind the library is to make it very easy and intuitive to use with minimal syntax and effort by the programmer.  As such, I want it to be easy to combine arrays of different data types and simply convert the narrower data type to the wider case.p  pFor example, if I have two arrays, one with dtype codefloat64code and the other with dtype codecomplex128code, when adding them together I would like to convert the codefloat64code to codecomplex128code, but if its codefloat64code and codecomplex192code, I want to convert to that instead.  However, if it was a combination of codefloat64code and codecomplex64code, there isnt a valid conversion between the two without losing precision of the codefloat64code, so I would want to convert both to codecomplex128code.p  pI immediately saw the problem that I would have to look for each combination of types and determine their narrowest common widened type think least common multiple if I wanted my library to be fully robust.  I emdontem want to convert everything to the widest type possible, since that becomes memory inefficient very quickly, and I often have very large arrays stored in memory.p  pstrongIs there a good way to determine the narrowest common widened type between two NumPy typesstrongp
Negative 1271 pSo usually I am able to figure out the problem by looking at the error log to see what is going on.  Most of the time it gives me a line number to look at and I can figure it out from there.p  pbut now, I am lost.  I dont understand where my code is faulty.p  pI am not sure where to even start troubleshooting this error.  I am not asking for any handouts or code corrections so I didnt display my code yet, I just would like some tips in figuring out this errorp  precode1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072 FATAL EXCEPTION main 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072 android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at android.os.StrictModeAndroidBlockGuardPolicy.onNetworkStrictMode.java1117 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at java.net.InetAddress.lookupHostByNameInetAddress.java385 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByNameImplInetAddress.java236 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByNameInetAddress.java214 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultClientConnectionOperator.openConnectionDefaultClientConnectionOperator.java137 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at org.apache.http.impl.conn.AbstractPoolEntry.openAbstractPoolEntry.java164 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at org.apache.http.impl.conn.AbstractPooledConnAdapter.openAbstractPooledConnAdapter.java119 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector.executeDefaultRequestDirector.java360 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.executeAbstractHttpClient.java555 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.executeAbstractHttpClient.java487 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.executeAbstractHttpClient.java465 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at com.sencide.AndroidLogin.postLoginDataAndroidLogin.java101 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at com.sencide.AndroidLogin.onClickAndroidLogin.java153 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at android.view.View.performClickView.java4211 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at android.view.ViewPerformClick.runView.java17362 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at android.os.Handler.handleCallbackHandler.java725 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java92 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5227 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java795 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java562 1210 171220.359 EAndroidRuntime14072    at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre

Negative 1271 pSo Im building a connectorlike program the executable as the backend of a website, the program is written in Visual Studio 2010 .NET 4.0 using C.p  pBasically, the frontend code will call the executable with parameters or command line argument, then the program will calls different function and perform the appropriate operation.p  pNow I ran into an issue with emuploading filesem. The website will ask the user to browse for a file, then hit the upload button. Once the upload button is hit, the website will call the executable. My idea is in the executable, somehow get the uploaded file and save a copy on the local server, then perform any modification on the local copy.p  pHopefully I explained my case well enough.

Negative 1271 pI have a JSON model being loaded successfully based on AlteredQualias skinning example. However, I would like to not reveal the model until it is finished loading. As you can see in this example, the models appear first and then their texture resources load afterwards a hrefhttpalteredqualia.comthreeexampleswebglanimationskinningtf2.html relnofollowhttpalteredqualia.comthreeexampleswebglanimationskinningtf2.htmlap  pI added an opaque div to my webpage and then using the callback of the JSONloader.load function I move that div out of the way. Unfortunately this callback is triggered when the mesh is added to the scene, which does not seem to be blocked by the skinning images still being loaded, so I end up revealing an incomplete scene.p  pHow should I go about fixing this I have seen that there is a function THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture which has a callback function but it does not seem to be involved in this use case where the mesh is declared and defined like sop  precodevar mesh  new THREE.SkinnedMeshgeometry,new THREE.MeshFaceMaterialmaterials geometry and materials are both parameters of jsonloader.load callback codepre  pI had a look at the source code of MeshFaceMaterial and SkinnedMesh but could not see a solution there. p  pThanks for any assistance offered.p

Negative 1271 pI have a web app that is published via ExpressJS on NodeJS, of course. It uses CouchDB as its data source. I implemented long polling to keep the app in sync at all times between all users. To accomplish this I use the following logicp  ol liUser logs into app and an initial long poll request is made to Node via an Express route.li liNode in turn makes a long poll request to CouchDB.li liWhen Couch is updated it responds to the request from Node.li liLastly Node responds to the browser.li ol  pSimple. What is happening, though, is that when I refresh the browser it freezes up on strongevery fifth refreshstrong. Huh very wierd. But I can reproduce it over and over, even in my test environment. Every fifth refresh without fail freezes up Node and causes the app to freeze. Rebooting Node fixes the issue.p  pAfter much hair pulling I emTHOUGHTem I solved it by changing thisp  precodeapp.getchangessince, security, routes.changes codepre  pTo thisp  precodeapp.getchangessince, security, function   routes.changes  codepre  pHowever, after further testing this is just failing to run routes.changes. So no actual solution. Any ideas why long polling CouchDb from Node would do such a strange thing On the fifth refresh I can have a break point in node on the first line of my routing code and it never gets hit. However, in the browser I can break on the request to node for long polling and it seems to go out. Its like Node is not accepting the connection for some reason...p  pShould I be approaching long polling from Node to CouchDB in a different way Im using feedlongpoll, should I maybe be doing feedcontinuous If I turn down the changestimeout in couchdb to 5 seconds it doesnt get rid of the issue, but it does make it easier to cope with since the freezes only last 5 seconds tops. So this would seem to indicate that node cant handle having several outstanding requests to couch. Maybe I will try a continuous feed and see what happens.p  pself.getChanges  function since p  pBrowserp  precode        .ajax             url changes  since,             type GET, dataType json, cache false,             success function data                  try                      self.processChangesdata.results                     self.lastSeqdata.lastseq                     self.getChangesself.lastSeq                     self.longPollErrorCount0                  catch e                      self.longPollErrorCountself.longPollErrorCount  1                      if self.longPollErrorCount lt 10                          setTimeoutfunction                               self.getChangesself.lastSeq                         , 3000                      else                          alertYou have lost contact with the server.

Negative 1271 pIn my ASP.Net MVC4 project I have a method which saves the user entered data. And once the saving is done the same page is reloaded with new values.p  pHowever in a new requirement we have a time consuming Index rebuild for search functionality to be added when ever user saves data. Though we were successful in getting it done, the rebuilding is a time consuming task. Hence the user need to wait for considerable amount of time to get the post back action to see the refreshed page.p  pSo I was wondering is there a good practice, to break down this project. As we had previously, the control should return to the user, once the data is saved in DB. While the rebuilding should happen at background.p  pstrongPrevious Function Prototype.strong p  precodefunction saveData     Do Saving    Return Success  codepre  pstrongCurrent Functionstrongp  precodefunction saveData             Do Saving         Rebuild Index        Return Success      codepre  pNow can I return the success before rebuilding, also I need to do the rebuilding at the back end. p  pOne way we thought was, since we are in Azure we can create a worker role to run this ever few interval. However this is a big overhead since we may not get the user update their profile every now and then. But when ever they do it should run.p  pIs any inbuilt ASp.net  C function or architecture  can be used to achieve this Asynchronuslyp

Negative 1271 pCan this tree be constructed faster in JSp  pI have WebSQL DB table structure  ID, ParentId, MasterId, [some other fields that are not relevant]p  pFirst 20 records are being read and shown to client immediately. then Ids of these records are asynchronously passed to construct object that is global to the page not my decision, just go along lets call it PageObj. This object contains datasources that contain tree structure of objects. Example PageObj.bcAccount[42].Children[0].Children[0]... bcAccount[42] would be holder of MasterId for all the children.p  pTo avoid reading DB layer by layer all records are being selected from WebSQL DB by MasterId like p  precodeSELECT  FROM TableName WHERE TableName.MasterId IN [list of ids] codepre  pI get records in callback function with structure like thisp  precode     results  rows   item  functioni, length  100    codepre  pto read value one would do p  precode    results.rows.itemi[DBColumnName] codepre  prows have length property so I can loop thorough records, but item can be accessed only by calling results.rows.itemi. p  pChildren can belong to more than one parent. At the moment I call ComposeRecordsToTreeStructure concurrently for each layer of children because to bolt them to PageObj parents of child objects have to be present, so one concurrent call per tree layer.p  pI know I can simply change structure by reiterating all items into list and then simply .grep children, but lets not do that.p  pQUESTION Is there a way of optimising this mechanism to not go layer by layer, or layer by layer but faster that would result in faster tree construction I have no knowledge of position of records in tree just Id, ParentId and MasterId. Expected tree depth can go up to 20 levels, width can be up to 1000 records.p  pCurrently used mechanism is below. p  precodefunction ComposeRecordsToTreeStructureresults, tableArray, columnArray, options       if results.rows.length gt 0       if options.parentLayerIdList  undefined             options.parentLayerIdList  options.masterIdList                    var childRecordIdArray  []          var isThereNextLayer  false          forvar i  0 i lt options.parentLayerIdList.length i                              forvar ii  0 ii lt results.rows.length ii                                      ifoptions.parentLayerIdList[i]  results.rows.itemii[options.parentIdColumn]                                               var childRecord  AttachChildRecordsToParentsresults.rows.itemii, options.parentLayerIdList[i], options.knockoutContextName                         childRecordIdArray.pushchildRecord.Fields[Id]                         if isThereNextLayer  false                             forvar iii  0 iii lt results.rows.length iii                                 if childRecord.Fields[Id]  results.rows.itemiii[options.parentIdColumn]                                                                      isThereNextLayer  true                                     break                                                                                                                                                         if isThereNextLayer              options.parentLayerIdList  childRecordIdArray         ComposeRecordsToTreeStructureresults, tableArray, columnArray, options        function AttachChildRecordsToParentsrecordRow, id, knockoutContextName      var childTreeOptions  id  id, knockoutContextName  knockoutContextName, results []             findObjectsInChildTreeByIdchildTreeOptions             if childTreeOptions.results.length gt 0                         var childRecord  AttachChildRecordrecordRow, childTreeOptions.results                       return childRecord   function ComposeChildObjectrecordRow          var recordObject   Fields , SetFields [], Insert false          for var field in recordRow                  recordObject.Fields[field]  field  Id ampamp recordRow.PrimaryRowId  recordRow.PrimaryRowId  recordRow[field]                       return recordObject   function AttachChildRecordrecordRow, pageObjParentResults       var recordObject  ComposeChildObjectrecordRow         forvar i  0 i lt pageObjParentResults.length i             ifpageObjParentResults[i].Children  undefined                                      pageObjParentResults[i].Children  ko.observableArray[]                              if .greppageObjParentResults[i].Children, functionchildren return children[Id]  recordObject[Id].length  0                 pageObjParentResults[i].Children.pushrecordObject                   return recordObject   function findObjectsInChildTreeByIdoptions      if options.item  undefined              forvar item in PageObj[options.knockoutContextName]                      findObjectsInChildTreeByIditem  PageObj[options.knockoutContextName][item], id  options.id, results options.results                   else              if typeof options.item.Fields[Id]  function                      if options.item.Fields[Id]  options.id                 options.results.pushoptions.item                  else                      if options.item.Fields[Id]  options.id                 options.results.pushoptions.item                   if options.item.Childrenundefined                      forvar item in options.item.Children                              findObjectsInChildTreeByIditem  options.item.Children[item], id  options.id, results options.results                             codepre

Negative 1271 pI would like to provide two links on the codeiOScode app that I am working on now for downloading two configuration profiles using safari. Both are configured to install codeCALDAVcode payloads and nothing else. The profiles were configured with different name, identifier, description under general and with different account description, Account Host name under codeCalDAVcode payload. Left the other fields unattended. Exported the profiles and hosted on an internal server. Created two codehtmlcode files to provide the download links from safari. But I am not able to install both the profiles simultaneously. One profile will get installed and the details will appear on the settings page of codeiPhonecode, and when I try to install the other, it always shows this alert codeProfile Installation Failedcode codeProfile Failed to Installcode.     p  pAm I missing something here, or is it because that Apple may only allow multiple codeCalDAVcode payloads on the same configuration profile which works properly. Are there any limitations on the number of configuration profiles that could be installed on a device. But I also observed that one of the configuration profile that I created will get installed alongside that of codeTestFlightcode. So I feel multiple configuration profiles on the same device should work somehow, but I havent got any success on it yet. p  blockquote   pstrongPlease notestrong that I created the configuration profiles using the codeiPhone Configuration Utilitycode app in codeMACcode, and none of the profiles were signed.p blockquote  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

pPlease help me to solve this problem. Thanks in Advancep
Negative 1271 pIm trying to build a web app using as much of the outofthebox ASP.NET security as I can.  I got it up and running pretty easily using the default patterns but now Im trying to make a simple modification and am getting all sorts of confused. Basically, all Im trying to do is use a generic userID a stringified GUID, for instance instead of a username as the primary key for the user account. Googling yields many threads on how to inherit from MembershipProvider but they all assuming youre overriding the same method signatures like CreateUserstring username, string password, .... Im kind of lost because I dont know what event is raised that causes CreateUser to be called, nor what methodclass to override in order to change how its called. p  pYes, I know I can pretend username is userID in this particular scenario but Id really like to understand how this works in case I want to make addition mods in the future.p  pAlso, Im trying to customize what info is stored in the authorization cookie but I think Ive got a handle on that. Some of the relevant code emin its current halfbaked conditionem is shown below. Thanks. p  pMyMembershipProvider.csp  precodenamespace MyOrg.MyApp.Infrastructure      public class MyAppMembershipProvider  MembershipProvider              int minPasswordLength

Negative 1271 pI am writing an addin for XL 2010  2013 that makes use of a database connection via an ADODB.Connection object. I tried to declare the object in various ways in order for it to remain between uses of the addin but so far to no avail.p  pThe goal is to initialise the connection at startup and maintain this for the duration. When the addin workbooks Open event is triggered the initialisation code runs fine, makes the connection and I have an ADODB.Connection object. When the sequence finishes control returns to XL as you would expect. Stepping through the code shows that it all works as expected. The ADODB.Connection object would then be disposed of in the WorkbookBeforeClose event handler.p  pWhen a user then attempts to use a feature of the addin after startup  initialisation that utilises the database connection we find that the connection object has dropped out of scope and no longer exists, even when set as a global in a standard module. I have also tried setting this as a public variable  object in the workbooks code module but to no avail.p  pIs there a way to persist the connection object or any object for that matter between successive uses of the addinp  pCheersp  pThe Frogp  pPS For DB afficionados out there who will usually rightly point out that maintaining a connection is not the best way In this scenario it is required whether I like it or not. The back end BE uses a lot of temp tables that need to remain between using the different features of the addin.p  hr  pstrongANSWERstrong    p  hr  pWell Tony you had it right, I just hadnt put it in the right place.p  pThe answer to the problem is as followsp  p1 You need to declare a function that will return for you the connection objectp  precodeFunction cn As ADODB.Connection  Static mCon As ADODB.Connection  On Error Resume Next                                            Better way to handle  If mCon Is Nothing     Or mCon.State  adStateClosed Then                           exists connected      Set mCon  New ADODB.Connection                             create anew     mCon.Open getConnectionString                               open the connection     Debug.Print Connection attempted      If mCon.State  adStateOpen Then Connected  True End If Set cn  mCon End Function codepre  p2 Declare the working connection object as Static as in the code abovep  p3 Use the name of the function in place of the connection object. In this case the function is called cn. You can use cn just as you would if you declared the object directly and called it directly. Using the function you will get intellisense and all other normal object properties and methods available to you including using it with stored procedures if you have them.p  peg Debug.Print cn.ConnectionString will call the function and return the connection string of the underlying ADODB.Connection objects property.p  p4 I have used a function to generate the connection string called getConnectionString  you can hard code it or make your own function. All it does is provide the correct connection string for the ADODB.Connection objects Open method call.p  p5 I have a variable called Connected which I believe will be better served as a function rather than a global. ie Write a function that checks the State property of the connection object and returns a boolean.p  pThanks for the help Tony. Nice pointer.p  pEnjoy the solutionp  pCheersp  pThe Frogp

Negative 1271 pI have a MVC 5 web site for Intranet use.  On one page there is a Partial View that displays some details of whatever item is selected in a Drop Down List.  This all works locally in Development.  However, once I deploy the site to our Internal Web Server it no longer does.  Everything else still does, Create, Edit, Delete, Details, Index, and a different Partial that loads on the Index page.  p  pThis Partial, which loads on the Create page using AJAX and is located in the same folder as codeCreate.cshtmlcode, does not.p  pThoughts Im not even sure where to look first here...p  pThis is on my Create page and is what loads the Partial, again this works great in local Dev.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function           ProductionOrder.changefunction               var po  ProductionOrder.val.toString             .getwetWashRequestsGetDetailsWONumber  po, function data                  ProductionOrderDetails.htmldata                 ProductionOrderDetails.fadeInfast                            ltscriptgt codepre  pIf I manually enter the URL displayed in that AJAX into a browser with a valid codeWONumbercode it returns the correct data.p  pThis is the Method being called in the Controllerp  precodepublic PartialViewResult GetDetailsstring WONumber                          var details  db.vwProductionOrderLookups.Wherex gt x.No  WONumber.SingleOrDefault         return PartialViewProductionOrderDetails, details      codepre  hr  pEDITp  pSo, it seems to be related to the URL path.

Once the transition is made, I want to receive the response in the second ViewController through the NSURLSession delegate methods and then display the data. Is this possiblep  pNote I dont want to keep the user waiting in the first ViewController until the server comes back with its response, because while the server is processing the data, I can keep the user engaged in the second ViewController with other imageselements displayed.p

After updating the group, it shows up as black in the legend. p  pFinally, hovering over the affected groups instead highlights the remaining groups for example, only updating goodGroup and then hovering over its legend label highlights the fairGroup and poorGroup charts simultaneously.p  pSorry if that sounds confusing.

Negative 1271 pWe have created a bunch of users in CRM 2011 using the SDK. However, we added their Security Role records through the database.p  pEverything seems to work fine, until these users started to save their own User Dashboards and Advanced Finds.p  pThe users could create their own User Dashboards. However, once they created them, they could not see them. They were not in their list of Dashboards  only the System Dashboards where there. p  pThere were no errors in the event viewer or even the trace logs. p  pI used SQL Profiler to see what it was doing and I discovered it was checking the PrincipalEntityMap table for principals that had an objecttypecode of 1031  which is the User Dashboard called UserForm. p  pHow do these records get createdp  pI can write a SQL script to populate the database with these missing records. p  pWhat I would like to know is why they are missing Any ideas p  pWhere do the records for PrincipalEntityMap come fromp

Negative 1271 pIm having trouble encrypting Apache logs. I want to encrypt the logs using OpenSSL EVP functions i.e. using symmetric key wrapped inside an RSA public key, and encrypt streams of incoming logs to disk.

Negative 1271 pIm in the midst of developing an app for the iPhone and iPad.  It supports iOS6 and iOS7 and it uses auto layout exclusively.  p  pThis past week, when Apple announced that iOS8 was ready for primetime, I upgraded one of my iPhones and an iPad both to iOS8.  I also bumped my XCODE up to version 6.  I have 2nd iPhone which I left at iOS7.p  pI generated new executables with Xcode 6 and I was distressed to see that their screen layouts were messed up when executed on my devices running iOS8 but still fine on iOS7.  This is true on both my physical devices and on Xcodes emulators.p  pIt took a lot of digging but Im pretty clear now on whats happening though I dont know why.p  pSpecifically, certain auto layout operations are failing for me on iOS8 but they are fine on iOS7.p  pSome examples involving a button which I am placing on an underlying view whose size is equal to the size of the screenp  p1 If I ask auto layout to position the buttons horizontal center CX equal to the underlying views horizontal center, the result is that the buttons horizontal center is placed on the underlying views left edge.p  p2 If I ask auto layout to to make the width of the button equal to 50 of the width of the underlying view, it gives it no width at all.p  pI am able to work around these issues as followsp  p1 I ask auto layout to position the buttons center equal to the underlying views left edge plus 50 of the screens width.p  p2 I ask auto layout to make the buttons width equal to 50 of the screens width.p  pI am slowly clawing my way, with workarounds like these, back to auto layout code that works for me on both iOS7 and iOS8.  But I am really wondering whats going on here.p  pIt looks like auto layout cannot determine the size of the underlying view and so auto layout calculations that require that information fail.  But it does know where the top and left edges of the view are so calculations based on those data succeed.p  pThis is a large app and Ive written many hundreds of lines of auto layout code for iOS6 and iOS7 that work perfectly for me.p  pIve been tweaking and trying things now with iOS8 for three days and Im no wiser than I was when I began.p  pAnyone have any suggestions or thoughts as to what might be the issue herep

Negative 1271 pIm trying to make a simple project that generates a random amount of copper depending on how much your rollProgress is. Whenever you get 100 copper you can convert it to silver and 100 silver can be converted to gold. To increase the rollProgress you need to click a button to add either one, two, five, or ten and pay a set amount of silver and copper. p  pThe generate button works every time, as well as the copperToSilver button so I removed the code for it compact it down. I also removed the Text Fields from the GUI class which showed the amount of coppersilvergold that you currently have.p  pThe problem is that addRoll ActionListener is only working when I press it the first time and thereafter it doesnt work regardless of whether it meets the requirements. The project is not complete but the rest of the things which are complete doesnt seem to work at all.p  pI removed my temporary debugging but it seems that the RollProgressPlusTwo method doesnt run at all when you press the addTwoRoll button, which it should.p  pI looked online but couldnt find anyone with the same problem, only similar of which none could fully relate and none of them had any

Negative 1271 pIn Sweden there is a football soccer betting game where you try to find the outcome of 13 matches. Since each match can have a home win, a draw or an away team win this leads to 3131594323 possible outcomes. You win if you have 10 to 13 matches correct.  You dont want this to occur when a lot of other people also have high scores since the prize sum is divided among all winners. This is the background to the more generic question that Im looking for an answer to how to find all arrays that differ by at least x elements from a given array within the matrix in this case 159432313.p  pThe first obvious idea that came to my mind was to have 13 nested for loops and compare one array at the time. However, Im using this problem as a training session to learn myself Python programming. Python is not the optimal tool for this kind of task and I could turn to C to get a faster program but Im interested in the best algorithm as such.p  pIn Python I tried the nested for loop method up to 10 matches, then the execution time got too long, 5 seconds on the netbook Im using. For each added match, the execution time went up tenfold.p  pAnother approach would be to use a database and that might be the solution but Im curious what the fastest way of solving this kind of problem is. I havent been successful googling this problem, maybe because its hard to use the correct description of the problem in a short search. p

Negative 1271 pIve built a custom Node MyNodeView.fxml based on the class MyNode.java. It is a VBox composed of several Controls internally. The number of internal components may differ for each object, so the MyNode height property is set to USECOMPUTEDSIZE.p  pMyNode is intended to be used as a node in a custom tree graph. After creating a new MyNode I need to use its height property to calculate its position in relation to its parent.p  pBut ran in to problems when trying to use it inside a ScrollPane. Ive attached a ChangeListener in MyNode.java to track the changes of its HeightProperty. When I create a new instance of MyNode and add it to a ScrollPane it changes height 8 times Seemingly for each row in the VBox and also for things like padding and borders.However when I use it in any other container it only changes once, from 0 to its intended height. p  pI really dont want to invoke the layoutroutine eight times each time i add a new node to the graph.p  pSo my question is why is this happening with ScrollPane and is there an elegant way to immediately obtain the true height of my node in this case.p  pemSimplified code illustrating the issueemp  pstrongMyNode.javastrongp  precodeimport java.io.IOException import javafx.beans.value.ChangeListener import javafx.beans.value.ObservableValue import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader import javafx.scene.layout.VBox  public class MyNode extends VBox      public MyNode          FXMLLoader fxmlLoader  new FXMLLoaderMyNode.class.getResourceNodeView.fxml         fxmlLoader.setRootthis         fxmlLoader.setControllerthis         try              fxmlLoader.load          catch IOException ex              System.out.printlnex                   heightProperty.addListenernew ChangeListener              Override             public void changedObservableValue observable, Object oldValue, Object newValue                  System.out.printlnHeight changed from    oldValue  , to   newValue                             codepre  pstrongMyNodeView.fxmlstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt  ltimport javafx.geometry.gt ltimport javafx.scene.shape.gt ltimport java.lang.gt ltimport java.util.gt ltimport javafx.scene.gt ltimport javafx.scene.control.gt ltimport javafx.scene.layout.gt  ltfxroot maxHeightInfinity maxWidthInfinity minHeightInfinity minWidthInfinity prefWidth80.0 stylefxbackgroundcolor lightgreen fxbordercolor black typeVBox xmlnshttpjavafx.comjavafx8 xmlnsfxhttpjavafx.comfxml1gt    ltchildrengt       ltStackPanegt          ltchildrengt             ltRectangle arcHeight5.0 arcWidth5.0 fillDODGERBLUE height30.0 strokeBLACK strokeTypeINSIDE width70.0 gt             ltLabel textTest Nodegt                ltStackPane.margingt                   ltInsets gt                ltStackPane.margingtltLabelgt          ltchildrengt       ltStackPanegt       ltStackPanegt          ltchildrengt             ltButton mnemonicParsingfalse textButton 1gt                ltVBox.margingt                   ltInsets left5.0 gt                ltVBox.margingt             ltButtongt          ltchildrengt       ltStackPanegt       ltStackPanegt          ltchildrengt             ltButton mnemonicParsingfalse textButton 2gt                ltVBox.margingt                   ltInsets left5.0 gt                ltVBox.margingt             ltButtongt          ltchildrengt       ltStackPanegt       ltStackPanegt          ltchildrengt             ltButton mnemonicParsingfalse textButton 3gt                ltVBox.margingt                   ltInsets left5.0 gt                ltVBox.margingt                ltStackPane.margingt                   ltInsets bottom5.0 gt                ltStackPane.margingt             ltButtongt          ltchildrengt       ltStackPanegt    ltchildrengt ltfxrootgt codepre  pstrongMain.javastrongp  precodeimport javafx.application.Application import javafx.event.ActionEvent import javafx.event.EventHandler import javafx.scene.Group import javafx.scene.Scene import javafx.scene.control.Button import javafx.scene.control.Label import javafx.scene.control.ScrollPane import javafx.scene.layout.FlowPane import javafx.scene.shape.Rectangle import javafx.stage.Stage  public class Main extends Application      MyNode node     Rectangle rect     Label lbl      Override     public void startStage primaryStage          FlowPane root  new FlowPane          ScrollPane scrollPane  new ScrollPane         scrollPane.setVbarPolicyScrollPane.ScrollBarPolicy.ALWAYS         scrollPane.setHbarPolicyScrollPane.ScrollBarPolicy.ALWAYS         root.getChildren.addscrollPane          Button btn1  new Button         btn1.setTextCreate Node in ScrollPane         btn1.setOnActionnew EventHandlerltActionEventgt               Override             public void handleActionEvent event                  node  new MyNode                 Group g  new Groupnode                 scrollPane.setContentg                                Button btn2  new Button         btn2.setTextCreate Node in FlowPane         btn2.setOnActionnew EventHandlerltActionEventgt               Override             public void handleActionEvent event                  node  new MyNode                 Group g  new Groupnode                 root.getChildren.addnode                                 root.getChildren.addAllbtn1, btn2          Scene scene  new Sceneroot, 300, 300         primaryStage.setTitleNode example         primaryStage.setScenescene         primaryStage.show           public static void mainString[] args          launchargs        codepre
Negative 1271 pWe have a JSF webapp with Primefaces 4.0 and CAS Single Sign On.p  pWhen a user requests an ajax action by clicking a pcommandButton or similar component with ajaxtrue after he has lost his session because SSOut in another tab, nothing happens, no response from server or action is triggered.  We need to manage that situation to inform the user that his session is no longer available, by showing a dialog or redirecting him to home or a custom page, but we dont know how.p  pajaxfalse solves the problem, but this is not what we want to do.p  pNo ViewExpiredException is thrown.p  pEDIT We had already read and tried a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma112061144074715this BalusCs solutiona without success. No Exception is thrown and Handler has nothing to do. Note that isnt an Expired Session or Invalidated by TimeOut session, is just an explicit session.invalidate caused by Cas Sign Out in another tab.p  pWe also tried javascript jsf.ajax.addOnError solution, and again nothing to capture. Only pajaxStatus onError event catches something, but no way to identify that particular error. Even overriding ajaxStatus javascript function, error data parameter is undefined...  Also, plog says Request return with errorerror. but, which error is it how do we identify it We are stuck on this issue...p

Negative 1271 pI am running Hive 0.14.0 and hadoop 2.6.0. When I am running simple hive commands using hive CLI, all seems to be okay. But then I installed R on this machine and installed RHive.

I have read on stackoverflow and hive uses derby database behind to store the metadata of the tables. Does someone have an idea as to what might be happening here.

I have to compare two images.p  pRight now I compare the pixel information between 1st image and the 2nd, by comparing RGB values of their respective pixels. This solution, although works, but is not robust. p  pIf somehow I can thicken the pixel widths in second, the chances to find intersection in images will increase. p  pPlease help me to write a code to thicken pixel widths in an image. p  pBoth images are Black and White.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2Rgky.png altenter image description herep  pNow I want to increase pixel like this and compare this image with what user have drawn.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUStb7.png altenter image description herep  pOr suggest if there is a better way to compare 2 images. p

Negative 1271 pIm working on an ASP.NET MVC application where administrators can add new users and flag them to complete additional information before they can use other features of the site. For example, we have a ForcePasswordReset bool, and a requirement to complete Security Questions. Were not using Active Directory for these users.p  pUltimately this is the behavior Id like to implementp  ol liDirect any logged in user who is required to change password to the ChangePassword view. And if that user clicks on other links, funnel him back to the ChangePassword view.li liSame scenario for users who must change their security questions.li ol  pInitially I placed the checks directly into a Login Controller ActionResult. But this only accounts for the Login action.  An abbreviated code sample is below.p  precodepublic ActionResult LoginLoginModel model, string returnUrl              if ModelState.IsValid                           ...               Does the user need to complete some missing information             if externalUser.IsSecurityQuestionInfoComplete  false                 return RedirectToActionChangeSecurityQuestions, MyInfo             if externalUser.ForcePasswordReset                 return RedirectToActionChangePassword, MyInfo               Login was successful             return RedirectToLocalreturnUrl               codepre  pOne problem with this approach is that there are other hyperlinks presented in those targeted views, where the user could navigate away from the targeted interface.  So for example, a user directed to the ChangeSecurityQuestions view could just click away from it.p  pLoggedin users can change those settings at any time.  I could create duplicate views for changing passwords and security questions that are fashioned just for this scenario, where the user is being forced to update these values.  In the interest of staying DRY and reducing maintenance, Id like to use the same views for both scenarios users who just want to edit that info, and users who are being forced to edit that info.  But, trying to stay DRY in this respect may be wrongheaded if the alternative is worse.p  pI started to write a method within a helper class to divert these users, trying something like this.p  precode     ltsummarygt      Check scenarios where the ExternalUser needs to complete some missing information, and divert as necessary.      ltsummarygt     public static void divertExternalUserAsRequiredController controller, ExternalUser externalUser              if externalUser.IsSecurityQuestionInfoComplete  false             return controller.RedirectToActionChangeSecurityQuestions, MyInfo          if externalUser.ForcePasswordReset             return controller.RedirectToActionChangePassword, MyInfo      codepre  pBut that RedirectToAction is inaccessible due to protection level.  Moreover, that doesnt appear to be recommended a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2472578isitpossibletouseredirecttoactioninsideacustomauthorizeattributeclasIs it possible to use RedirectToAction inside a custom AuthorizeAttribute classa.

Negative 1271 pIm having an issue with my algorithm that is supposed to implement dijkstras algorithm for path finding. p  pThe issue is that occasionally the system locks up and I think it has to do with either connections not being made properly, nodes not updating properly or something in my lists that isnt being added so it kinda sounds like what Im saying is that nothing works...except that in SOME cases, it works and finds the correct path. p  pIve simplified the grid by making the map size small since its easier to see if there are errors in the outputs.

Negative 1271 pWhen I start Xorg on my Debian8 Jessie, and when session is ready to work I get error message invalid option session. When I skip this message theres nothing wrong happens. I use Xfce graphical environment, when tried run FluxBoxI know its only window manager dont get error box.  What can I do to prevent our messagep
Negative 1271 pI am turning in desperation to the combined wisdom of this generous forum, which has helped me out of many, many technical jams in the past. This time I am just plain stumped however. I have read many answers, on this site and others, and combed through the relevant apache docs. p  pI have a relatively simple python script to generate a web page. I am currently running Yosemite, on an old MacBook Pro. The script is located at codeltDocumentRootgtmydirmyscript.pycode. Note that codemydircode is a symbolic link. p  pIf I put an .htaccess file in codemydircode, with  codeOptions ExecCGIcode and codeAddHandler cgiscript .pycode, I can actually load the script. Otherwise, nothing I do in any of the config files httpd.conf, .conf, etc will make the file execute. It just displays the text of the file.p  pSo, ok, if I really have to, I can use the .htacess file. I am hoping to avoid that, however. I have been researching all day, and really, really cant think of anything else to try. All I can think is that theres some quirk where codeltDirectory DocumentRootmydircode doesnt actually map to the filesystems idea of codeDocumentRootmydircode. In which case, how do I point a codeltDirectorygtcode container at mydir p  pThe relevant options can clearly be set for that dir, or else .htaccess wouldnt work.p  pThe file can clearly be found in that place, since the browser will happily display its text. p  pOh, and the file itself is valid, I can run it from the command line, or in a python interpreter.p  pIm at the end of my rope here.

Is this the correct way to do this It seems like there has to be a way where one would avoid unnecessary iterations. I know what Im looking for and I know that the elements are going to be there even if the values may be null.p  pIm thinking in the lines of a select statement with both year and id as conditions.p  pFor clearance, Im looking for certain elements and their respective values. Therell most likely be multiple occurrences of the same element but FirstOrDefault is fine for that.p  pFurther clarification As requested by the legend Jon Skeet, Ill try to clarify further. The XML document contains fields such as codeltyeargt2015ltyeargtcode and codeltidgt123032ltidgtcode and I need the values. I know which elements Im looking for, and that theyre going to be there.

Negative 1271 pI was reading about the async pattern in a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick161729134X relnofollowC in deptha, and I decided to take Jons advice and decompile the async code to actually see what was going on.

But to my surprise the C compiler does create the statemachine in both cases follows all the same code as one would expect, except in the first code block it doesnt actually save any information in the machine. Where in the second it does store all the variables. p  pIs there a reason that the compiler decides to not save the variables in the state machine and expose two different code paths based on the codeawaitcode kewordp

Negative 1271 pI am uploading new build on iTunes Connect via Xcode. Ive selected all my settings automatically I mean about provisioning profiles and certificates, so the bundle id is also appropriate.p  pAfter I clicked submit to app store button, the Xcode build loader displayed for me all entitlements setting, and displayed that it uses app store distribution certificate which is correct, because I use automatic settings for signing.p  pAfter some time, the Xcode build loader said that everything is successes and the build on the iTunes, but I dont see it in my prerelease tab, I can say it will be better if loader said suckesses instead of successes. So it appeared for me many times when I uploaded new build with new build number but there are no new builds on iTunes.p  pAlso I tried to upload build number 4, because I already have 3 builds under prerelease section, but without success. So I bump build to 10 and voila its on the iTunes.p

It does, in fact, pad the first field to be 16 characters, but it makes it difficult to work with the field, because it adds the necessary whitespace to get to its maximum length of 16 every time the field is modified.

Negative 1271 pIm attempting to access registry values written by another program that should be readily available via the HKEYCURRENTUSER registry base key when accessed from the logged on users context.

Negative 1271 pI recently came accross the codeyieldcode keyword in Python as well as JavaScript  I understand that this is primarliy used for the generator pattern, but the language construct seems to be used in asynchronous functions as well where my interests lie. In asynchronous functions it may merely act as syntaticsugar and I know there are alternative patterns to achieve the same effect  But I like it  A LOTp  pI want to know if I can do something similar in C even with inline assembly. I came across a Java implementation using threads a hrefhttpsgithub.commherrmannjavageneratorfunctionshttpsgithub.commherrmannjavageneratorfunctionsa which I can more or less implement in C. However this is wont be a freestanding implementation, and my interest is purely in a freestanding implementation.p  pComing to C coroutines a hrefhttpwww.chiark.greenend.org.uksgtathamcoroutines.htmlhttpwww.chiark.greenend.org.uksgtathamcoroutines.htmla, one of the deficits is that stack objects cant be used. However I am still OK with this since current asynchronous callback implementations also cant use the stack. However the problem lies in a freestanding implementation  I cant think of a way to collect all the register variables and store them without a hosted environment.p  pTheres probably a solution using the codesetjmplongjmpcode, however I am pretty sure these cant be implemented freestanding.p  pSo the question is Is it possible to implement Python yield functionality in strongfreestandingstrong Cp  pPersonally I think I have exhausted the possibilites, so Ill ask this  If you could have a hosted implementation, how would you implement it preferably with some macro magic I have a fairly ugly implementation which Ill post later on if nothing cool comes up.p  pAlso I dont want C implementations  Unless you can wrap around the C with pure C functions.p  pEDIT A basic requirement is that the generator function has to be reenterant.p

Negative 1271 pI am in the process of developing a forum with PHP and MySQL. I got stuck in a problem that i have never came up with before. The problem occurs when I am invoking a method to edit a forum post.p  pI have a object class to handle behaviors of a post. And I am trying to make the forum SEO friendly too, therefore I am using Unique URLs to identify posts as a experiment. So bare with me if i have made threatening security holes and please be kind enough to point them out toothank you.p  pI will copy only the required parts of the code. p  pThis is where i invoke the methodp  precodeurl  GET[url] postsgteditForumPostheading, desc, catetgory, username, tags, url codepre  pAnd to be sure if its not an array i codeprintrurlcode which gives me the correct url sent in the address. I am familiar when I codeprintrcode an array, it says that it is an array and gives the indices and their values too. Its not like that in this case.p  pSo in the editForumPost function I call another function like thisp  precodepost  thisgtgetPostDetailsurl codepre  ptake note here, that I am using this same function to get the values of the post to print it to display to the user. and I dont have a problem there, But when i call the function inside the editForumPost function I get a p  blockquote   pArray to string conversion in blah blahp blockquote  pI cant think of a reason why this happens. So then again i changed my functions to run in postids instead of urls, same problem happens for some reason.p  pI will post the full code of the functions and invoking places if anyone requests. p  pEDITp  precodepublic function getPostDetailsurl                      query  thisgtdbgtprepareSELECT heading,postid,category, description, username, category,posttime FROM forum WHERE friendlyurl   LIMIT 1             querygtbindValue1,url              try                              querygtexecute                          catchPDOException e                              dieegtgetMessage                           return querygtfetch          codepre  pThank you Bhashithep

Negative 1271 pI am writing a programm, whitch should list some tasks, order them by date and so on.p  pThe last thing I did was, to add the sort by date functionallity. Before that everything worked fine.

The code that triggers the error looks like this I will post the full code afterwards on pastebin you also should know, that this is a german date format, which means, day.month.yearp  precodestatic

Negative 1271 pWhen the phone is in portrait mode, it shows the title and image at the top and below that theres the button and codeListViewcode with comments. However when I turn the phone to be in landscape mode, the button and codeListViewcode dissapear and only the title and image are shown. I basically cant scroll below the image anymore. p  pThere is a third element  a codeTextViewcode for the body  that is also inside that codeScrollViewcode each layout will either have that codeTextViewcode with content or an image. The same thing happens when its the codeTextViewcode that has content and no image. This does not occur when the image or text emdontem take up the entire screen though.p  pPortrait modep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com5zyjc.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5zyjc.jpg altenter image description hereap  pLandscape modep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comUDGah.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUDGah.png altenter image description hereap  pAccompanying codep  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationvertical     androidpaddingBottomdimenactivityverticalmargin     androidpaddingLeftdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingRightdimenactivityhorizontalmargin     androidpaddingTopdimenactivityverticalmargin     toolscontextnet.vannevel.redditapp.activities.PostActivitygt      ltTextView         androidididpostDetailTitle         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidgravitycenterhorizontal         androidtextColor000 gt      ltScrollView         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt          ltLinearLayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidorientationverticalgt              ltImageView                 androidididpostDetailImage                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt              ltTextView                 androidididpostDetailBody                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt         ltLinearLayoutgt     ltScrollViewgt      ltButton         androidididpostDetailViewOnlineButton         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidonClickonViewOnlineButtonClicked         androidtextView original source gt      ltTextView         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextCOMMENTS gt      ltListView         androidididpostDetailCommentList         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre

Negative 1271 pIve created a c console app that runs some tests on a website. For this is is necessary to run the console app op a machine with a user logged in.p  pNow I want to do this as a part of Release Management, and start the console app using the build in tool Run Command Line and tried also Run Command Line as User. I see that the console app that is called did run, but do not see any interaction with a browser as it does when running it as a user logged on on that machine. And the tests fail.p  pAlso i tried creating my own tool for Release Management, and that is running the process with CreateNoWindow  truefalse and .UseShellExecute  truefalse. All things work fine running it from the command line itself on the machine. But if i run it from Release Management it fails.p  pI use the same domainuser to run the app the user that is used for the deployment in release management.p  pStarting the console with UseShellExecute  true, results in an error The Process object must have the UseShellExecute property set to false in order to redirect IO streams.p  pSo how to get the console app to run within an existing user session using Release Management...p

To access the codeitemelementcode  item arrays you could bind to the property of the codehostelementcode likep  precodelthostelement itemsitemElementsgt     ltitemelementgtltitemelementgt     ltitemelementgtltitemelementgt lthostelementgt codepre  pto print the content of the codeitemElementscode iterate over it with codedomrepeatcode p  precodelttemplate isdomrepeat itemsitemElementsgt     ltulgt         lttemplate isdomrepeat itemsitem.values asvaluegt             ltligt[[value]]ltligt         lttemplategt     ltulgt lttemplategt codepre  pso far everything works as expected.

Negative 1271 pI have a MS Access 2010 Application split up in back and frontend. The frontend fetches some data and then assigns the fetched recordset to a listcontrol, which causes the whole application to crash without throwing an error, but only from time to time and not on every function call.p  precodeDim cn as new ADODB.Connection Dim rs as new ADODB.Recordset  rs.Open Select orders.quantity as [Quantity], orders.price as [Price] amp          from orders,cn, adOpenKeyset, adLockReadOnly Set Me.orderlst.Recordset  rs rs.close  Set rs  Nothing Set cn  Nothing codepre  pThis procedure causes a crash triggerer by an invalid memory write According to the generated minidump. I assume that the reassignment of the listcontrol sometimes works and on some other time writes into an restricted memory region.

Negative 1271 pI used ML PipeLine to run logistic regression models but for some reasons I got worst results than R. I have done some researches and the only post that I found that is related to this issue is a hrefhttpdatascience.stackexchange.comquestions5710whydoeslogisticregressioninsparkandrreturndifferentmodelsforthesamethisa . It seems that a hrefhttpspark.apache.orgdocslatestmlliblinearmethods.html relnofollowSpark Logistic Regression returns models that minimize loss functiona while R glm function uses maximum likelihood. The Spark model only got 71.3 of the records right while R can predict 95.55 of the cases correctly. I was wondering if I did something wrong on the set up and if theres a way to improve the prediction.
