Positive 5990 pIm working on a project about lung cancer classification by using mutated genes. Now that my data contains 1302 samples and 664 genes. All genes are considered as a binary feature of a sample. The data contains 3 types lung cancer A, B and C and ABC is about 831.p  pI have implement several classifiers, GBDT, Random Forest, Naive Bayes but all the classifiers come out with the similar result, the accuracy is about 0.60 and about 90 samples were reclassified to classA by the classifier. Are there any ways to improve the classfier  Appreciate for any help.p  hr  pThe genes are from the gene panel of my company, I try to select some genes by feature selection method rather than use all genes from the panel, but it still didnt work.

Positive 5990 pCan someone please help me clarify.p  pI am currently using collaborative filtering ALS which returns a recommendation list with scores corresponding to the recommended items. In addition to this, I am boosting the scores 0.1 if the items contain a tag that corresponds with what the user has specified they prefer such as romantic movies. To me, this is considered a hybrid collaborative approach since its boosting the Collaborative filtering results with contentbased filtering Please correct me if I am wrong. p  pNow, what if I did the same approach without doing Collaborative filtering would it be considered Contentbased Filtering since I will be still recommending dishes based on the content and attributes of each dish corresponding to what the user has specified they like such as romantic movies. p  pThe reason why Im confused is because Ive seen contentbased filtering where they apply an algorithm such as Naive Bayes etc, and this approach would be similar to a simple search of the items on the contents. p

Positive 5990 pIt just come across my mind that, for example, suppose we have training data with codeNcode points in 2 dimensions. We know that we can always, naively, build a decision tree so that we can classify each data point. probably we are overfitting, and depth can go to 2supNsupp  pHowever, we know that if the data set is linear separable, then the decision tree can take an advantage, probably. Use the above data set as an example, can we determine the upper bound of depth for linear and nonlinear data set Is it guaranteed that the upper bound of depth for linear case is smaller then nonlinear casep

Positive 5990 pWe have some data and a probabilistic model with latent variables, we want to estimate the posterior distribution after seeing the data. Usually this pxz is hard to compute, so we use variational inference, or MCMC. p  pWhat I dont understand is why MCMC plays an essential rule. MCMC can only draw samples. But we may want to fit the model parameters other than just draw samples. For example, for px,thetaz we may want to fit the parameter theta, only draw samples cannot satisfy our need.p  pMy question is, since MCMC can only draw samples of the posterior, why it is importantp

Positive 5990 pI am going to build an emotion recognition system based on Paul Ekmans emotion model  happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral using STASM and OpenCVs SVM with video clips as the source.p  pHowever, I have no clue about what kind of data that should be fed for the training phase itself. I know that we have to input a codeMatcode type to the SVM, but Im wondering what should be included in the matrix.p  pFor example, suppose we have landmark points that we get from STASM. Each landmark point has its own code[x,y]code coordinate. Furthermore, each face expression has many landmarks points, lets say we cover 17 landmark points. That means after knowing those 17 landmark points for one face expression, we will wrap this data to the first row of the matrix data type and feed it into the SVM and then the process is the same for other expressions we should label them too but lets not focus on that part first.p  pMy questionp  ol listrongIs feeding the x and y coordinates of the landmark points for the system enoughstrong brli ol  pIntuitively I dont think it is enough. We should get some sort of displacement from a neutral expression to a peak expression described in this paper a hrefhttpwww.cs.cmu.edupmichelpublicationsMichelCSTDissertation.pdf relnofollowherea. For example, we can get the Euclidean distance of each landmark point from a neutral state to a happy state and feed the strongdisplacements of the coordinatesstrong to the matrix, instead of the coordinates.p  pBut I feel like there is still something missing with this idea. p  ol start2 listrongIf every expression is compared to the neutral state, then how can the machine know if someones face is in a neutral statestrong brli ol  pI am confused because I dont know to what should the neutral expression comparison be based on since other expressions actually use neutral expression as the comparison. p

Positive 5990 pThis is a general decision tree algorithm question of using attributes to split nodes based on entropy. I am using a Decision Tree algorithm in SQL Server Data Mining to predict the type of an animal. What I noticed was that the same input column  attribute is used twice to split the node. My understanding was that an input column  attribute could only be used once for splitting a node. For example, below reptiles is used to split each value of animals  1 and 0 . Based on what I have read so far, for a decision tree, once an input column  attribute is used to split a node value, you should not be using it again. You pick an attribute from remaining set of UNused attributes. Please let me know  correct me if I am wrong. Each attribute can take value of 1 or 0. I can understand reptiles 1 and reptiles0 when animals1. But once reptiles has been used as an attribute for a split, I dont understand why it is being used again for the animals0 split.p  precode                    reptiles1 gt     animals1 gt                                reptiles0 gt codepre  pAll   p  precode                    reptiles0 gt     animals0 gt                      reptiles1 gt  codepre

And as noted in the article, the Authorization Broker would only accept claims issued by the Authentication Broker. p  pWhen thats setup, any time a client attempts to use the new service, it must authenticate with the strongemAuthentication Brokeremstrong emissuing an authenticated claimem and then get authorized with the strongemAuthorization Brokeremstrong emissuing an authorized claimem.p  pThis is all fine and dandy and the architecture is clear, but I dont see exactly how to implement an STS. As I mentioned, most if not all examples around the web are showing how to use CardSpace, but that doesnt exactly work when you have a database backing up your authentication scheme.p  pstrongSample Scenariostrongp  pimg srchttpimg512.imageshack.usimg5128329claimsbasedsecurityza6.jpg altalt textp

Negative 5990 pWhat are the security implications for hosting signed jars on the internetp  pAs I understand jar signing, once a user choose to autoaccept a certificate, it doesnt matter if the signed jar came from your domain, linked from another domain or hosted on another domain. For example, Sun uses this method to give applets OpenGL support, by providing hosted signed jar that link to the driver. So are there any precautions I should make as the developer and certificatesigner of the javacode I make availablep

For example, I want to give all of the users in my site their own subsites of the form mydomain.comusername, and then hang all of the UserController actions off of that. p  pHere is a rough example of what I am doingp  pI have a UserController, with action methods like Index, Profile and Bio.p  precodepublic ActionResult Profile int UserID       User u  User.SingleOrDefaultu gt u.UserID  UserID     return Viewu  codepre  pIn RegisterRoutes method, I do thisp  precodeforeach User user in User.Findu gt u.Active  true      routes.MapRoute          ,          user.UserName  action,          new  controllerUser, actionIndex, UserIDuser.UserID         codepre  pThis works, and it works exactly as I want it top  precodedomain.com[username]Profile domain.com[username]Bio codepre  pare now valid, working routes, and they can take in the UserID as the method parameter in the controller because each user gets their own route. Also, the default routes still work. Yay.p  pMy question is, is this insane I am creating an entry in the route table for every user in the system. How many routes is too many Will this kill my server if there are over 10 users 50 1000p  pAnd if this emisem insane, how else might I accomplish this goalp  pThanks in advance. I look forward to some input from the hivemind.p
Negative 5990 pIm trying to polish my web programming skills with the unobtrusive yet extremely helpful polish I find on many sites.  Stackoverflow.com, for one.  When I ask a question, the page submits the question, and my browser reloads itself displaying my question.  My back button works like it really should, not asking me from a users perspective the scary question of In order to display this page we need to resend your request to the server.  Do you want to do thatp  pIn addition, after submitting the question, if I hit refresh it also doesnt call another form submit.p  pIs there a site that lists out tricks like this  Im assuming that Im going to have to rethink the standard displaysubmitdisplay cycle that I use most often, but Im very willing to learn some new techniques.p  pAnyone have any pointers for mep  pEDIT  I figured Id say this here instead of in individual comments.  Firebug is indeed a fantastic tool, and I use it all the time.  Im using jQuery more and more these days, but Id hardly call myself proficient at it.  Id love to use Firebug to track what happens when asking questions, commenting, etc, but I dont want to abuse the site for the purposes of learning.    p

Negative 5990 pIm beginning to work with Eclipse for some Java development. Im quite new to Eclipse, as I am a Visual Studio developer normally.p  pI tried to install the CheckStyle Eclipse PlugIn and Subversive, using the Eclipse Install new Software feature. No errors, everything seems to have worked well. Clicking on What software is already installed in the Installdialogue shows me a list of installed plugins.

Negative 5990 pIve been developing a travel planning site  a hrefhttpwww.tripgrep.com relnofollowtripgrep.coma  which is built on appengine, GWT and a hrefhttpcode.google.compsmartgwt relnofollowsmartgwta, among other technologies.  It is still early days, and the site is now working well on my development environment, which is either a windows or mac computer.   p  pHowever, I am frequently talking up the website to my friends when we are at a bar or other venue, so I am standing there while they try to access the site via an iPhone, Android or Blackberry  Ive witnessed all three.   It has been painfully obvious that the browser based frontend takes a long time to download on a mobile device.  I am pretty sure this is because of the javascript download for SmartGWT.    p  pSo, I would like to look at alternatives to SmartGWT.p  pWhat I like about SmartGWT is that it has a reasonable look and feel out of the box  I dont need to learn any design or css and it has an office application look.  This is considerably better than the GWT builtin widgets, which just get a blue border.   The better lookandfeel is why I went with SmartGWT early on.   However, the slow load times are killing me on these mobile demos.  So now I want a fast loading widget alternative that has good lookandfeel out of the box.    p  pThe features I care about are tabs, good form layout, Google maps API integration, grid data viewing.  If those are all available in a library that loads quickly on a mobile device, then thats the library I want.  p

Negative 5990 pIm writing a simple browser based game with a 2d tile map. Im implementing this map as an HTML table ok, you can yell at me for using tables later, but it works with background images.

Negative 5990 pWell, I have another problem that I cant seem to find the solution to...I have an app that loads the main.xml file on startup, of course. In it are several buttons, and I want the buttons to take me to a different XML file. I just used setContentViewR.layout.newlayout.xml method for that, and it works great. The problem comes in after that. If I reference any of the buttons or other objects in the new layout, the app wont even finish loading before it errors out and closes on the emulator. However, if I take all references to objects out, the app runs fine. I can navigate emTOem the new layouts, but their buttons cant do anything. Do I need to create a separate Java file for each layout Or am I doing it all wrong Im trying to be as specific as I can...I suppose you could say I need to have different pages in my app like a website would.p

Negative 5990 pI am preparing unit tests for DAO layer which interacts with entity objects for persistence in to database. p  pTechnology Hibernate Java 1.6 JUnitp  pSuppose i want to create test method addEntityAp  pfor doing so i create EntityA object. Now problem is EntityA is child of EntityB. So i must specify reference of EntityB in EntityA. EntityA will be persisted in database only if EntityB is persisted first. So thus to test persistnece of EntityA i will have test persistence of EntityB. this way it can lead to chain of entities which must be persisted before actual persistence of EntityA for testing. One may argue that i should give reference of EntityB object which is already persisted. But problem is that i dont want to make test cases dependent upon test in database rather than test data.

Negative 5990 pI did some searching on here and havent found anything quite like this, so Im going to go ahead and ask. This is really more about semantics than an actual programming question. Im currently writing something in C but the language doesnt really matter.p  pIm well aware that its good programming practice to keep your functionsmethods as short as possible. Yet how do you really know if a function is too long Alternately, is it ever possible to break functions down too muchp  pThe first programming language I learned other than Applesoft BASIC, which doesnt count... was 6502 assembly language, where speed and optimization is everything. In cases where a few cycle counts screws up the timing of your entire program, its often better to set a memory location or register directly rather than jump to another subroutine. The former operation might take 3 or 4 cycles, while, altogether, the latter might take two or three times that.p  pWhile I realize that nowadays if I were to even mention cycle counts to some programmers theyd just give me a blank look, its a hard habit to break.p  pSpecifically, lets say again using C we have a private class method thats something like the followingp  precodeint Foodostuffint x      thisgtx  x      various other operations on x     thisgty  thisgtx  codepre  pIve seen some arguments that, at the very least, each set of operations should be its own function. For instance, dostuff should in theory be named to setxint x, a separate function should be written for the set of operations performed on class member x, and a third function should be written to assign the final value of class member x to class member y. But Ive seen other arguments that EVERY operation should have its own function.p  pTo me, this just seems wrong. Again, Im looking at things from an internal perspective every method call is pushing an address on the stack, performing its operations, then returning from the subroutine. This just seems like a lot of overhead for something relatively simple.p  pIs there a best practice for this sort of thing or is it more up to individual judgmentp

Negative 5990 pI have a simple console application written in C that acts as a stub for launching another application through its jumplist. Purpose is to add jumplist abilities to applications that do not support this. Call it stub.exe. When running stub.exe it creates a custom jumplist using these steps taken right form the MS samplesp  precodecreate an ICustomDestinationList ICustomDestinationListBeginList create an IObjectCollection foreach itemtoadd   create an IShellLink, set its pathargumentstitleicon   add IShellLink to the IObjectCollection get the IObjectArray interface from the IObjectCollection call ICustomDestinationListAddUserTasks IObjectArray interface  ICustomDestinationListCommitList codepre  pWhen pinning stub.exe to the taskbar and rightclicking it, the jumpilst appears and it contains all IShellLinks added. When clicking an item, it will launch the corresponding process.p  pNow Id like a process launched through this jumplist have its windows grouped under stub.exes taskbar icon, instead of having its own group. They key to get this working seems to be the AppUsermodelID. This is what I tried so farp  ul lijust for testing, create a couple of shortcuts and set the id through IPropertyStoreSetValue PKEYAppUserModelID, id . Indeed, when launching these shortcuts, they will all group under the same taskbar icon.li lisince the shortcuts do what I want, I tried adding shortcuts to stub.exes jumplist no effect. The shortcuts dont even show up in the jumplist maybe one cannot have a shortcut to a shortcut, yet all methods return SOKli lisetting the PKEYAppUserModelID on each of the IShellLinks that get added to the jumplist no effectli licalling ICustomDestinationListSetAppID no effect li liinstead of using SubTasks, tried with SHAddToRecentDocs no effect. The recent doc list does not show up. But now things get messy. After setting the AppUserModelID on the shortcut that is responsible for the pinned taskbar item the one in APPDATARoamingMicrosoftInternet ExplorerQuick LaunchUser PinnedTaskBar, the jumplist changed it does not show the Tasks item anymore, but does show Recent and the items I added using SHAddToRecentDocs. Now when clicking them I get a dialog box with a title that starts with ddesktop followed by Chinese characters. Hovering the items in the jumplist also shows Chinese characters instead of the descirption I set.li ul  pQuestionsp  ol liWhats with the Chinese characters in the jumplistli liHow come setting the app id on the taskbar shortcut toggles between Tasks and Recent sections, why are they not both thereli liWhat would be the way, if even possible, to achive what I actually want a custom jump list of which the items launched will group under its taskbar icon note that the processes I plan to laucnh their do not have their app id set currentlyli ol

Negative 5990 pI am having issues with data overload while processing a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPointcloud relnofollowpoint clouda data in MATLAB. This is what I am currently doingp  ol liI begin with my raw data files, each in the order of 30Mb each.li lipI then do initial processing on them to extract n individual objects and remove outlying points, which are all combined into a 1 x n structure, codetestsetcode, saved into codetestset.matcode  100Mb.p  pemSo far so good. Now things become complicatedempli lipFor each point in each object in codetestsetcode, I will compute one of a number of features, which ends up being a matrix of some size for each point. The size of the matrix, and some other properties of the computation, are parameters of the calculations. I save these computed features in a 1 x n cell array, each cell of which contains an array of the matrices for each point.p  pI then save this cell array in a code.matcode file, where the name specified the parameters, the name of the test data used and the types of features extracted. For examplep  pcodetestsetfeaturetypeA5x50.2x0.2alpha3beta4.matcodepli lipNow for each of these files, I then do some further processing using a classification algorithm. Again there are more parameters to set.pli ol  pSo now I am in a tricky situation, where each final piece of the initial data has come through some path, but the path taken and the parameters set along that path are not intrinsically held with the data itself.p  pstrongSo my question isstrongp  pIs there a better way to do this Can anyone who has experience in working with large datasets in MATLAB suggest a way to store the data and the parameter settings more efficiently, and more integrallyp  pIdeally, I would be able to look up a certain piece of data without having to use regex on the file stringsbut there is also an incentive to keep individually processed files separate to save system memory when loading them in and to help prevent corruption. p  pThe time taken for each calculation some 2 hours prohibits computing data on the fly.p

Negative 5990 pI have two tables from two different departmentsp  pstrongCustomerstrongbr IDbr Countybr Statebr Name, Age, etc.p  pstrongBilling Ratestrong  composite ID of CountyStatebr Countybr Statebr Pricep  pIn Hibernate, I have defined a ManyToOne relationship on a composite foreign key countystate.  I followed this a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatestableannotationsreferenceenhtmlsingled0e217720Hibernate20Annotations relnofollowHibernate Annotationsap  pWell, Every Customer has a countystate, but not every countystate pair is represented in the billing table.  When I load some of the Customer entities, I get an exception of EntityNotFoundException for the relationship.  Based on my reading here same problem as me a hrefhttpcommunity.jboss.orgmessage522967 relnofollowJBoss Forumsa It looks like every relationship NEEDS to be there, although you can slap on a NotFoundactionIGNORE tag.  Well, I did that too and it works without error, but Im still having a problem.  Hibernate does not cache the negativehits, so if a countystate pair is NOT found, the exception is ignored, but the knowledge of that lack of data is not cached, so it reloads the relationship on demand, every time.  So, when I do a left join fetch on the relationship, it effectively does nothing for me.  Also, a batchfetch does nothing, I have to load them one at a time, and Im talking about thousands of entities.p  pWhat can I do to resolve this  Is the DB designed wrong  Thanksp

Negative 5990 pIm attempting to run an external process with a timeout and read all of the output it produces. This is proving to be a surprisingly Herculean task. My basic strategy is to start a process using ProcessBuilder and read its output in the main thread.

Negative 5990 pAs an exercise, I am trying to extend codeImageButtoncode to add some features I think would be useful. One, in particular, is a drow shadow. Ive hit the proverbial wall with this one.p  pIt seems to me, that a class extending codeBitmapDrawablecode is necessary. This class contains a codePaintcode object used to draw the bitmap to the screen. If I had access to this codePaintcode object... all I would have to do is call its codesetShadowLayercode method... but, alas, it is codeprivatecode. There is a codepubliccode method, codegetPaintcode that will return the paint object, but any modifications to it would be useless unless there were a corresponding codesetPaintcode method. There isnt.p  pCurrently, my thought process looks something like the following...p  ol liCreate class codeShadowBitmapDrawablecode which codeextends BitmapDrawablecodeli liWithin this class, somehow alter the codeBitmapDrawablecodes codePaintcode object with codePaintcodes codesetShadowLayercode method.li liIn my custom codeImageButtoncode class, call codesetImageDrawableDrawable dcode, and pass it my codeShadowBitmapDrawablecode object.li ol  pStep 2 is the road block. What can I do to change codeBitmapDrawablecodes codePaintcode object Note that I added my thought process only as an indicator of where I am in this problem.

Can I prevent cmd2 from running without halting cmd1  I have until cmd1 finishes, at which time cmd2 will start, and then it is too late.p  pI dont think this is possible, but maybe with job controlp  pDoes a Z  bg push both commands into the bg Rather, does cmd1 go to the bg and cmd2 is where pending background like  cmd still waiting for cmd1 to exitp  pThe commands were not invoked conditionally, ala cmd1 ampamp cmd2, nor were the commands backgrounded on invocation. cmd1 is running in fg, cmd2 has yet to execute.p  pThe facepalm here is that cmd1 is going to take a really long time to complete, cmd2 is destructive and Id really not like to have to interrupt and do cmd1 over again. Id just like cmd1 to finish and cmd2 to not run at all.  p  pI could cause cmd2 to fail by moving cmd2 to cmd2.sav until cmd1 finishes and result in a bash cmd2 command not found  but I was hoping for a more elegant solution. cmd2 might be used by others before cmd1 is finished. Yes, I could wrap cmd2.real in a cmd2 wrapper with a user test or somesuch, but this way lies madness.p

So no idea what this certificate is needed for.p  p2 Second one is for signing up issued tokens so that RP is able to make sure the token is really issued by trusted ADFS, not intercepted, right p  p3 Third one is probably for reverse purposes ADFS makes sure the message is really from trusted RP. p  p4 Encryption certificate for specific RP helps encrypt whole message token, so that even if you got https public key and intercept a message from ADFS, you can not read it not having other public key which supposed to be only know to RP, correctp  pCorrect me if Im wrong please.p  pAll this certificates are optional and Micorosoft says nothing about importance of which, the only mention I cound in WIF SDK help saying its better to use token encryption certificate in real life.

Except for a form called the placement new, new   attempts to allocate enough memory on the heap for the new data. If   successful, it initialises the memory and returns the address to the   newly allocated and initialised memory. However if new cannot allocate   memory on the heap it will throw an exception of type stdbadalloc.   This removes the need to explicitly check the result of an allocation.   A call to delete, which calls the destructor and returns the memory   allocated by new back to the heap, must be made for every call to new   to avoid a memory leak.p blockquote  pplacement new should be the solution, yet it makes no mention on how to do it.p  pP.S. 2 I know this can be done through stdlibs vector class, but Im avoiding it on purpose.p

Negative 5990 pI started working with PFBC yesterday and I cannot figure out how to pass my URL GET variables and Ive read every document available to no avail. The other thing I dont see in the documentation are examples of hidden fields because I tried passing variables that way to no avail. I can see from var dump that the GET variables are picked up on page loading but I cant pick them up upon submit. In my script below all variables show up fine except ids. Ive tried putting the GET variable into sessions, didnt work....hidden fields, didnt work, and the way its listed below,didnt work....for anyone familiar with this class its cake so some guidance here would help a ton.

Negative 5990 pFor the past month I have been working on a shared memorycircular buffer implementation.

The reader becomes notified of this change and subsequently connects to the new maps, and continues reading.li ol  pThe issue is after the writer reinitializes. The reader connects perfectly fine because I keep one memory map fixed for passing the new map names. However, after a little while the reader or writer will encounter a Attempted to writeread protected memory exception. To make things worse, this does not always happen and it does not matter if the new maps are larger or smaller than the previous ones. p  pI am using mutexes appropriately and the circular buffer indexes are well handled. p  pTheres quite a bit of code to show so if you just have a hunch and dont want to read it then I would appreciate your tip all the same Dp  pMy code is somewhat in the later phase by now so I will only show the likely suspects to avoid confusionp  pFor connecting reader to existing mapp  precode ltsummarygt  For connecting to existing memory map  ltsummarygt  ltparam nameNamegtltparamgt  ltremarksgtltremarksgt Public Sub NewByVal Name As String     mapHandle  OpenFileMappingPAGEREADONLY, 0, Global  Name Connect to preexisting map     If mapHandle  0 Then         Throw New System.ExceptionFileMapping  Name   error  GetLastError.ToString     End If      mapName  Global  Name     mapAddress  MapViewOfFilemapHandle, FileMapAccess.FILEMAPALLACCESS, 0, 0, 0     If mapAddress  0 Then         CloseHandlemapHandle         Throw New System.ExceptionMapViewOfFile error  GetLastError.ToString     End If     mapPointer  New IntPtrmapAddress End Sub codepre  pFor creating a WRITERp  precode    ltsummarygt  For creating new memory map  ltsummarygt  ltparam nameNamegt  Unique name to associate with map.  ltparamgt  ltparam nameSizegt  Total bytes to allocate for map.  ltparamgt  ltremarksgtltremarksgt Public Sub NewByVal Name As String, ByVal Size As Integer     mapHandle  CreateFileMapping0, IntPtr.Zero, PAGEREADWRITE, 0, Size, Global  Name     If mapHandle  0 Then         Throw New System.ExceptionFileMapping  Name   error  GetLastError.ToString     Else                   We need to connect if preexisting memory map         If GetLastError  ERRORALREADYEXISTS Then             IsNew  False          Create accesible flag             CloseHandlemapHandle Close the map we just created             mapHandle  OpenFileMappingPAGEREADONLY, 0, Global  Name Connect to preexisting map             If mapHandle  0 Then                 Throw New System.ExceptionFileMapping  Name   error  GetLastError.ToString             End If         End If              End If           mapName  Global  Name          mapSize  Size     mapAddress  MapViewOfFilemapHandle, FileMapAccess.FILEMAPALLACCESS, 0, 0, 0 mod E.L.

Negative 5990 pI have read Apples memory management guide, and think I understand the practices that should be followed to ensure proper memory management in my application.p  pAt present it looks like there are no memory leaks in my code. But as my code grows more complex, I wonder whether there is any particular pattern I should follow to keep track of allocations and deallocations of objects.p  pDoes it make sense to create some kind of global object that is present throughout the execution of the application which contains a count of the number of active objects of a type Each object could increment the count of their type in their init method, and decrement it in dealloc. The global object could verify at appropriate times if the count of a particular type is zero of not. p  pEDIT I am aware of how to use the leaks too, as well as how to analyze the project using Xcode. The reason for this post is to keep track of cases which may not be detected through leaks or analyze easily.p  pEDIT Also, it seems to make sense to have something like this so that leaks can be detected in builds early by running unit tests that check the global object. I guess that as an inexperienced objectivec programmer I would benefit from the views of others on this.p

Negative 5990 pIve got a Sharepoint site with a document library. Ive set up some custom views, and would like users to be able to select which one they like. This works fine in the AllItems.aspx view  ie, when I click the title of the Web Part, it takes me to a new page, with what seems to be a full DocLib page.p  pHowever, most users will access through a tabbed portal site, and thus will view the Web Part view instead.p  pMy question is is there a way to display the AllItems view within a Web Part Specifically, Id like the nice lefthand toolbar displaying my various views to appear in the Web Part.p

Negative 5990 pIm using EF 4, and Im stumped on another quirk... Basically, I have a fairly simple stored procedure thats responsible for retrieving data from SQL and returning a complex type. I have the stored procedure added to my model via a function import. Its more or less in the following structure.p  precodeusing ModelContainer context  GetNewModelContainer     return context.GetSummaryid, startDate, endDate, type.ToList   codepre  pI should mention that the code above executes over a strongremote SQL connectionstrong. It takes nearly 10 minutes to execute. However, using SQL Server Management Studio over the remote connection, the stored procedure executes almost instantaneously.p  pThere are only 100 records or so that are returned, and each record has approximately 30 fields.p  pWhen I run the code above locally no remote connection against a backup of the customers database, it executes without any delay.p  pIm stumped on what could be causing this performance hit. 10 minutes is unacceptable. I dont think its the stored procedure. Could it be the serialization due to the remote connection Any thoughts on how I can track and correct down the culpritp

Negative 5990 pI have a web application which uses a 3. party component witch needs a licens in order to work properly. In Visual Studio there is an option to pre compile the license information by rightclicking on the license.licx file and choose Build runtime license. This will generate the assembly AppLicense.dll. Hovever  this only works for web sites  not for web applications Build runtime license will not appear when you rightclick the license.licx file.p  pFor web applications the license information will be embedded in the main assembly of the web application at compiletime. This is means that if you are using a dedicated TFS build server, then the 3. party component has to be installed on the build server even though it is supposed to be a per developer license aggreement. This is annoying and it clutters up our build server, which is used by many different projects.p  pIt is possible to create a temporay website with the same 3. party license information and then use the Build runtime license which will generate a valid AppLicense.dll which we use in our web application. This works fine and now our build script just clears the license.licx file before compiling, so we do not have to have the 3. party component installed on the build server.p  pIs there anyway to precompile the AppLicence.dll from commandline, so we dont have to create a temporary websitep  pKind regards Peter Btker Frederiksen p

Negative 5990 pI am running fulltext queries on multiple tables on MySQL 5.5.22. The application uses innodb tables, so I have created a few MyISAM tables specifically for fulltext searches.p  pFor example, some of my tables look likep  precodeaccountsearch  id accountid name description hobbies interests  productsearch  id productid name type description reviews codepre  pAs these tables are solely for fulltext search, they are denormalized. Data can come from multiple tables and are agregated into the search table. Besides the ID columns, the rest of the columns are assigned to 1 fulltext index.p  pTo work around the 50 rule with fulltext searches, I am using codeIN BOOLEAN MODEcode.p  pSo for the above, I would runp  precodeSELECT , MATCHname, type, description, reviews AGAINSTjohn as relevance FROM productsearch WHERE MATCHname, type, description, reviews AGAINSTjohn IN BOOLEAN MODE LIMIT 10  SELECT , MATCHname, description, hobbies, interests AGAINSTjohn as relevance FROM accountsearch WHERE MATCHname, description, hobbies, interests AGAINSTjohn IN BOOLEAN MODE LIMIT 10 codepre  pLets just assume that we have products called john as well Pp  pThe problem I am facing arep  ul lipTo get meaningful relevance, I need to use a search without codeIN BOOLEAN MODEcode. This means that the search is subjected to the 50 rule and word length rules. So, quite often, if I most of the products in the codeproductsearchcode table is called codejohncode, their relevance would be returned as 0.pli lipRelevances between multiple queries are not comparable. I think a relevance of 14 from one query does not equal a relevance of 14 from another different query.pli lipSearches will not be just limited to these 2 tables, there are other object types, for example orders, transactions, etc.pli ul  pI would like to be able to return the top 7 most relevant results of ALL object types given a set of keywords 1 search box returns results for ALL objects.p  pGiven the above, what are some algorithms or perhaps even better ideas for get the top 7p  pI know I can use things like solr and elasticsearch, I have already tried them and am in the proces of integrating them into the application, but I would like to be able to provide search for those who only have access to MySQL.p

Negative 5990 pI am trying to figure out how the actual process communication is happening inside MPI communicators. I have 8 nodes, each has 12 cores 96 instances running. Each process has unique rank assigned and processes are able to communicate between each other.

Responsible for launching processes on the cell. Monitoring cell health nodes, processes. Reporting cell state to rest of universe. Routing communication between cells. I have not managed to find any developer documentation andor architecture papers of MPI implementations. Anyone has ideas how actual communication between MPI processes is implemented, i.e. how they manage to find themselves and get assigned ranks Is there a central or several central MPI internal processes for routing e.g., per nodep  pThanks, Davidp

Since ive put them together all hell has broken loose bit of an exageration but it may as well have because although they are both working, the page flickers badly on load.

I also notice that the increased page height, for the split second sometimes longer it takes the content to hide activates the scroll bars and i know this could have an affect. Im also using background images within the links on mouse over commands.... i didnt know what else to do.p  pIve read you can add script to only show the content once the script has loaded but I know zero javascript   ... yetp  pCan somebody please help me fix this Ive read lots of posts around the net but they all put the code with gaps where your supposed to fill in and where its put is expected to be known.

Then there was at least one successful recv from that socket, but twice the server then failed to write. And then i caught the exception when reading.  The log file does not have much information  i am therefore not 100 sure about my analysis so far. I have added lots of debug output to the socket routines and now i am better prepared for the next time.p  pThanks for all the helpful commentsp

Negative 5990 pI am designing the interface of a plugin system for our product. Current plugins will be written in C, but I envisage creating at least CC wrappers in the future.p  pI am in a quandary how to handle errors given the potential language discrepancies. Normally I use exceptions for errors, but I am assuming the exception mechanism differences across languages would make this non trivial, and some languages dont support exceptions.p  pIf this is the case then the only other patterns I can see arep  pA Return error codes from all functions. This only allows for predefined errors. Info about adhocunknown errors it not possible.p  pB Return bools from all functions and supply a GetLastError type function. Im not keen on this because of possible threading issues another thread changes the error before it can be read.p  pC Return bools from all functions and have the API provide a LogError function that the plugin can use to record any problems. Not keen on this either due to difficulty in programatically reacting to specific errors at the time of call.p  pD Pass in an error info object to every function call that can be filled in. Urgh.p  pIs there any kind of best practice that has evolved for cross language APIsp

Negative 5990 pWe have a multithreaded c app compiled with g running on an embedded powerpc. To memory leak test this in a continuous integration test weve created a heap analyzer that gets loaded with codeldpreloadcode.p  pWed like to guarantee that a function in the codeldpreloadedcode module gets called before anything else happens including creation of static objects etc.... Even more crucially wed like to have another function that gets called right before the process exits so the heap analyzer can output its results. The problem we see is that a vector in our application is being created at global file scope before anything happens in our codeldpreloadedcode module. The vector grows in size within main. At shutdown the codedestructorcode function in our preloaded module is called before the vector is destroyed.p  pIs there any way we can code a preloaded module to run a function before anything else and after everything else Weve tried using codeattributeconstructorcode and codedestructorcode without success.p  pReturning to the question title, Im beginning to suspect that codeldcode only looks in the preloaded module when resolving symbols for subsequent module loads. It doesnt actually load the preloaded module first. Can anyone shed any light on this for usp

Negative 5990 pSo essentially I have a table that his comprised of 3 columns and n number of rows. What im trying to do is this. When you hover over a td all the tds above that will be shaded I tried doing this with just a onmouseover and boxshadow but the text would appear above the shadow. So then I thought, why not just make a div with a transparent background and put the box shadow there When I insert the div in firebug it works great. So I moved on to trying to get the div to be created dynamically with jquery. Heres the relevant code from my js file that worked for the box shadowing stuff.p  pTLDR I need to create divs on all tds directly above the one your hovering over and do a boxshadow inset p  pAll of this is on a td mousoverp  precode    var col , row, tthis     col  t.index     row t.closesttr.index     var end  3  row  col 1    whileend gt 0        var i1       var tdLeftPosition  tdeq end3 .offset.left       var tdTopPosition  tdeq end3 .offset.top       var tdWidth  tdeq2.csswidth       var tdHeight  tdeq2.cssheight        ltdiv class  shadowbox iddivTdOverlayi styleheight tdHeightpxwidth tdWidth pxtop tdTopPosition pxleft tdLeftPosition px gt This is the box shadowing that I have comented out     td.sliceend3, end2.stop.animateboxShadow 0 0 170px 000000 inset, fast       i        used to get the tds position in the array one row up        end  3    codepre  pSo when I try the mouseover on my site i get this errorp  precodeSyntax error, unrecognized expression NaN throw new Errorsyntax error, unrecognized expression  msg  codepre  pand its in Line 4267 of the uncompressed jquery filep  pThanks in advance p  pEDITp  pFigured it out.

Negative 5990 pSome deadlocks are occurring in a database used by an API Im working on. This is only happening when the API is load tested. During the initial investigation and research some importing indexes seemed to be missing and have now been applied. This seems to have resolved the deadlock issue. Before the indexes were applied SQL was performing an index scan. After the indexes were applied SQL was performing an index seek.p  pThe reason for this question is to solidify my understanding of deadlocks. Im still a bit confused as to why without the indexes the select statements caused an exclusive X Lock in MS SQLp  pThis is purely, I think, down to me not understanding the deadlock graph.

Negative 5990 pIve been trying to implement a View layout with two simple containers side by side in a iPad dashboard manner.p  pIve been reading through numerous examples and of course the Apple View Controller reference for view controllers and in general but i have a most strange issue which hopefully have a simple explanation. p  pIve added the two view containers side by side, each which will house a viewcontroller having a different background color, one Round Rect Button and a label. And for testing purposes ive also added a Round Rect button to the mainViewController.p  pSo fairly straight forward and simple. Each view gets loaded in the container view, however i cant interact with any of them when button is clicked, NOTHING happens, no blue highlighting, so its not a question of delegating or any action from the buttons is received or not because nothing like that is implemented. However clicking the button ive put in the mainViewController holding the two containers, works flawlessly flashing blue as always. Another strange thing is that the background color is not shown on the container views either Only the buttons and labels.p  pProgram as followsp  pFiles ViewController.h and .m is mainViewController sidebarViewController.h and .m nothing changed in these files, UIViewController resultsViewController.h and .m nothing changed in these files, UIViewController AppDelegate.h and .m no change Storyboardp  pViewController.h, outlets created and connected to each container view in the Storyboard. p  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import sidebarViewController.h import resultsViewController.h  interface ViewController  UIViewController  property nonatomic, weak IBOutlet UIView sidebarView property nonatomic, weak IBOutlet UIView resultsView   end codepre  pStoryboard identifier set to both sidebarViewcontroller and Resultsviewcontroller in storyboard.p  pViewController.m, everything done by the book or probably not, but what at least it seems like to mep  precodeimport ViewController.h  interface ViewController   end  implementation ViewController  synthesize sidebarView,resultsView   voidviewDidLoad  [super viewDidLoad]  Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.

What if something needs to be done in the App delegate to get this to work Or have i done something else wrong in this codep  pEdit Found out another clue to what might be wrong When I disabled Auto Layout for the storyboard the views showed up and worked  but completely distorted, but now at least i get correct background color and the buttons are working. Any one know how to fix this without disabling auto layout since i guess i have to do all my layout programatically then p  pMany thanks,p

Negative 5990 pI have a directory listing script that I made, and I would like to know what direction I need to go in to make an option for a specific directory to be downloaded as a tarball.  A cronjob would not be acceptable because I would like this to be on demand so CPU cycles arent wasted on unwanted content, but I would also like caching for content that has been requested.  An ideal solution, which would exclude caching, would be to output the tar command to stdout, but how would I send that through PHP without having to wait for the command to finish  Some direction on this would be helpful.p

Negative 5990 pIve a homework of a code which searches for four numbers in an array whose sum equals to k in this example, k  10. The same array elements can be used more than once. In other words, it sums four elements of the array, compares the sums to value k, and returns true if they are equal, or moves on to other elements if not. So far the code sums four distinct elements of the array but I would need to alter it so that it works also when any single element is used in the sum of four elements more than once, for example if array[2]  4  k or array[0]  2  array[1]  2  k, it returns true. p  pstatic int[][] esim in the code are example inputs. For instance, 1, 2, 3, 4 returns true, because 1  2  3  4  k when k  10. 4, 3, 1, 5, 5, 6, 6 returns false when true is expected, because the code does not take into account duplicated elements and therefore ignores that 2  4  2  1  k. Similarly 2, 3 returns false when true is expected, although 2  2  2  3  k.p  pAnyone could give me a hint how to achieve what I wantp  precodeimport java.util.Arrays  public class Etsinta2       public static boolean etsiint[] tl, int k          Arrays.sorttl         for int i  0 i lt tl.length i              int b  i  1             int c  i  2             int d  tl.length  1             while b lt d                  if tl[i]  tl[b]  tl[c]  tl[d]  k                      return true                  else if tl[i]  tl[b]  tl[c]  tl[d] lt k                      b                     c                  else                      d                                                return false           static int[][] esim  new int[][]5,         2, 3,         1, 1, 1, 1,         1, 2, 3, 4,         4, 2, 3, 1,         4, 6, 5, 5,         6, 4, 5, 5,         6, 6, 6, 4,         4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6,         9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 6,         4, 3, 1, 5, 5, 6, 6      public static void mainString[] args          for int[] taulu  esim              System.out.printlnArrays.toStringtaulu   10    etsitaulu, 10              codepre

Negative 5990 pIm trying to implement my own 64bit shuffle function in CUDA. However, if I do it like thisp  precodestatic inline device double shflxordouble var, int laneMask, int widthwarpSize      int hi, lo     asm volatile mov.b64  0, 1 , 2  rlo, rhi  dvar      hi  shflxor hi, laneMask, width      lo  shflxor lo, laneMask, width      return hiloint2double hi, lo   codepre  pAll subsequent calls to shflxor will be instantiated from this 64bit version, no matter what the type of the argument is. For example, if I am doingp  precodeint a a  shflxor a, 16  codepre  pIt would still use the double version. A workaround might be using different function names. But since Im calling this shuffle function from a template function, using different names means that I have to make a different version for 64bit floating points, which is not quite neat.p  pSo how can I overload the shflxordouble,... function while on the same time still make sure the shflxorint,... can be called appropriatelyp

Negative 5990 pi am creating a CMS and have php creating a page. i have a while loop like thisp  precodewhilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresults  echo some html code . row[name] codepre  pits shortend but hopefully you get the point. i have the full thing in my page working just as it should and i wanted to move it to a function include as i want to reuse it. the problem is i do that and it stops working. p  pi did some testing and found that the function is getting the query result and after doing a var dump both were identical the problem comes when i try to assign it to an array. it comes back as false so in the above code, for example,p  precoderow  false codepre  pim toatly lost in this and if my explanation is confusing i appologise but i am a bit of a newbie i have tried searching but....i dont really know where to begin any thoughts.p
Negative 5990 pMy android app needs to play a live video from a remote RTMP server Adobe Flash Media Server.p  pAs androids codeandroid.media.MediaPlayercode doesnt support rtmp protocol, I found a library which provides me with streaming functionality. I.e. I can connect and receive portions of video stream as byte array.p  pThe question is how I can use this incoming video stream data to display it in a view p  pIt seems that current standard API doesnt allow me to do that. codeMediaPlayercode accepts either file or url. For audio data there is an codeAudioTrackcode which allows to achieve similar goal to mine, but for audio. For video I dont see an option. p  pAny suggestions are appreciated, maybe there is a third party media library which may provide the functionality for Android. p

Negative 5990 pI was wondering if the functionality given by Weka of building Model trees like M5P which has regression models in the leaves is possible in R.

The only way to get a Model Tree is using the Rweka package  Thanks for clarification. p
Negative 5990 pI am attempting to add Digest Authentication to an API being made available over HTTP, using embedding Jetty.  I have no web.xml, this is not a webapp.  The application starts up by creating a ClassPathXmlApplicationContext object from my file springconfig.xml.  In springconfig.xml I define lots of beans for services, etc, and also a bean to start a Jetty server.p  pThe Jetty server is configured with a DispatcherServlet actually a DispatcherServletWrapper class that implements ApplicationContextAware and sets the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext object as the parent of the GenericWebApplicationContext it creates, this way it can access the beans defined in my springconfig.xml file.p  pThat all works, where it breaks down is trying to add authentication.  I add all of the springsecurity configs for setting up digest auth, but I dont know how to make Jetty aware of the filter chain.p  pThe relevant sections of my springconfig.xml look like thisp  pre

Negative 5990 pI want to be able to go through a loop with if statements that will store a set of data. After the first loop gets its values I want to make a loop that goes through the list of values just created. In that loop there will be if statements that add children to the respect current digit in the list. Also each child will add the value of its respective parent. After that occurs the program will go through another loop adding a set of children to each new child previously dynamically made. The new set of children will add the value of the respected parent to there current value.p  pSome nodes may have 0 children some could have as many as 100. After the tree is created I need to go back through and compare each set of children for each parent and set the respective child sets value that I find to the parent, until eventually the root value will be determined.p  pBelow is a generic outline of part of sort of what I am looking to do.p  pBasically im looking to make a dynamic treeor any structure that works, then compare its values and find one root optimal value.

Negative 5990 phere is the situation, I am wrapping a subprocess in windows that I am communicating with remotly.p  precodeconnectionprocess  subprocess.PopenrCWindowsSystem32cmd.exe, shellTrue, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE,                                       stderrsubprocess.PIPE, stdinsubprocess.PIPE codepre  pThis is run with several threads polling for the stdout, stderr and writing to the stdin. The remote side is running from linux and will be sending across all of its data including ansi escape sequences.  For more information on these escape sequences a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiANSIescapesequences relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiANSIescapesequencesa..  The problem is two fold.   I first need a way to translate these escape sequences to whatever windows uses before they are sent the the subprocess and vice versa.  Is there a good way of doing this in windows  I have been looking at colorama, but is there a good example on how to do that   Second, I need to open my subprocess in a fashion that will give me everything in the full command prompt including the silly C at the beginning of each command line.  For some reason or another, pythons popen wont give that to you.  It filters it out which is what people want, 99 of the time...  What is the way to tell popen to not filter it For reference here is my communicator code and an example of how its being used.  After entering somthing, the C prompt is displayed. To reiterate my question, how do I get the subprocess to be exacly like a command windowp  precode  Created on Mar 2, 2013  author rweber  import subprocess import Queue from Queue import Empty import threading   class ProcessCommunicator      def joinself         self.te.join         self.to.join         self.running  False         self.aggregator.join         self.ti.join      def enqueueinself         while self.running and self.p.stdin is not None             while not self.stdinqueue.empty                 s  self.stdinqueue.get                 self.p.stdin.writestrs  nr             pass      def enqueueoutputself         if not self.p.stdout or self.p.stdout.closed             return         out  self.p.stdout         for line in iterout.readline, b             self.qo.putline      def enqueueerrself         if not self.p.stderr or self.p.stderr.closed             return         err  self.p.stderr         for line in itererr.readline, b             self.qe.putline      def aggregateself         while self.running             self.update         self.update      def updateself         line           try             while self.qe.notempty                 line  self.qe.getnowait   or q.gettimeout.1                 self.unbblockederr  line         except Empty             pass          line           try             while self.qo.notempty                 line  self.qo.getnowait   or q.gettimeout.1                 self.unbblockedout  line         except Empty             pass          while not self.stdinqueue.empty                 s  self.stdinqueue.get                 self.p.stdin.writestrs  nr      def getstdoutself, clearTrue         ret  self.unbblockedout         if clear             self.unbblockedout           return ret      def hasstdoutself         ret  self.getstdoutFalse         if ret               return None         else             return ret      def getstderrself, clearTrue         ret  self.unbblockedout         if clear             self.unbblockedout           return ret      def hasstderrself         ret  self.getstdoutFalse         if ret               return None         else             return ret      def initself, subp         This is a simple class that collects and aggregates the         output from a subprocess so that you can more reliably use         the class without having to block for subprocess.communicate.         self.p  subp         self.unbblockedout           self.unbblockederr           self.running  True         self.qo  Queue.Queue         self.to  threading.Threadnameoutread,                                     targetself.enqueueoutput,                                     args         self.to.daemon  True   thread dies with the program         self.to.start          self.qe  Queue.Queue         self.te  threading.Threadnameerrread,                                    targetself.enqueueerr,                                    args         self.te.daemon  True   thread dies with the program         self.te.start          self.stdinqueue  Queue.Queue         self.aggregator  threading.Threadnameaggregate,                                            targetself.aggregate,                                            args         self.aggregator.daemon  True   thread dies with the program         self.aggregator.start         pass def writestdinp,c     while p.poll  None         i  rawinputsend to process         if i is not None             c.stdinqueue.puti   p  subprocess.Popencmd.exe, shellTrue, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE,                      stderrsubprocess.PIPE, stdinsubprocess.PIPE c  ProcessCommunicatorp stdin  threading.Threadnamewritestdin,                            targetwritestdin,                            argsp,c stdin.daemon  True   thread dies with the program stdin.start while p.poll  None     if c.hasstdout         print c.getstdout     if c.hasstderr         print c.getstderr  c.join print Exit  codepre  pBetter yet..

Negative 5990 pAlthough Im not making a poker game, the objective of the game is the player with the highest poker hand wins. There are four players in my game. I was able to implement a gameboard and a function that would allow the player once they make a move to pick up the existing card on the gameboard and have the card face up in their hand. The game is over when there are no more cards or when a player clearly has the highest poker hand early in the and that theres no chance for a bigger hand This is evident as all the cards are face up. p  pORIGINAL p  pI found this python poker hand evaluator by Alvin Liang that I want to implement in my game a hrefhttpsgithub.comaliangpokerhandeval relnofollowhttpsgithub.comaliangpokerhandevalap  pBETTER SOLUTION for my needs I CURRENTLY WANT TO IMPLEMENT THIS from Peter Norvigs csc212 udacity course p  precodeimport itertools   Deck adds two cards  B black joker can be used as any black card S or C  R red joker can be used as any red card H or D  allranks  23456789TJQKA redcards  [rs for r in allranks for s in DH] blackcards  [rs for r in allranks for s in SC]  def bestwildhandhand Try all values for jokers in all 5card selections. hands  setbesthandh             for h in itertools.productmapreplacements, hand return maxhands, keyhandrank  def replacementscard Return a list of the possible replacements for a card.

Negative 5990 pWe are using MySQL .NET Connector 6.7.4 to access a MySQL database using Entity Framework 5.0 in .NET. After upgrading to version 6.7.4 we have started to run into problems with a timestamp column where NULL is allowed. We can save values without problems i.e. the column gets updated properly in the db but whenever we retrieve the entity corresponding to the row in the database the property corresponding to that column always returns null. We have tried to change the precision of the column in the edmxfile but that didnt change the behavior at all. Has anyone else experienced this issue Is there any known workaround, besides downgrading to an older version of MySQL .NET Connectorp
Negative 5990 pI am doing a little feasibility study for a Windows 8 Phone app. I am an experienced .net programmer but I am not familiar with some of the w8p concepts yet.

I want to add that the app would require very little processing power. p  ol lipIs it somehow possible to make frequent updates to the apps primary or secondary tile, like once a second Just to show some sort of counter or timer. pli lipIs it possible to schedule a reactivation of the app at a certain point in time I saw the alarm or reminder  notification, but that requires the user to tap the alarm window in order to restart the app.  I want to add that this is potentially annoying behavior, but in this case the user would explicitly want the app to pop up at a certain time.pli lipSince I suspect that point 2 might not be possible, I want to ask whether there is some way to have the alarm or reminder dialog without a snooze button, since that doesnt suit the apps logic.  Or at least give the app an opportunity to react if the user presses snooze. pli ol  pThanks for helpingp

One problem is the queue does all duplicates.p  pMy specific questions arep  ol liHow do i store the table information within each restaurant.li liWhat is the best way to maintain this list of restaurants so i can give return a list without having to sort this information everytime.li ol  pEDIT  For the question on how to store the table information.

I just need to numbers. no of seatstable.If i have a table of 4 but 3 peole, I will consider this table taken p  pI thought of creating 3 arrays. Lets say table represent 1,2 etc so int[] differentSeatingOnTable its indexes are tables and values are seats allowed. Next an array of tables with totalNoOfThosetable where indexs are tables and values are total number of such table. Similary for free tables freeTables where index are table and how many of such free table are left. p

Negative 5990 pIm new to OpenGL, and one of the operations I want to do is write pixels directly to to screen not using vertices and polygons.

Ive tried this and it works, but this seems like an inefficient way to draw pixels onto the screen. Why write my data in floatingpoints when its going to be transformed into an array of pixel data.pli lipCreate a 2d quad that spans the entire screen and write a texture to it. Like the first options, this seems to be a roundabout way of putting pixels on the screen. The texture would still have to go through rasterization before getting put on the screen. Also textures must be square, and most screens are not square, so Id have to handle that problem.pli ol  pSo heres my final question. How do I get, a matrix of colors, where codepixels[0][0]code corresponds to the upper left corner and codepixels[1920][1080]code corresponds to the bottom right, onto the screen in the most direct and efficient way possible using OpenGL Writing directly to the framebuffer seems like the most promising choice, but I have only seen people using the framebuffer for shading.p

Negative 5990 pIm involved in a project that uses an arduino as a test device for an electrical panel that goes like this.p  pUser will input type number through a keypad and based on the input, the device should be able to reassign pin modes.p  peverything else seems to be working flawlessly for me except that Ive come to the point where there are too many possible types involved. At the moment, I am able to do the process required using a switchcase statement since for a prototype, i decided to only incorporate 10 types.p  pThe main goal would be that the device should be capable of distinguishing multiple1100 types that have subtypes100. so in total there could be hundreds of items that needs to be stored within the device and thats why i decided to use an SD card to hold the data.p  pI am not new to programming so i can easily grasp concepts but my biggest problem right now is that I dont know the best way to implement this process. p  pWhat Im asking for is just some sort of a process flow to implement the query on a file on an sd card and return valuespin numbers that needs to be assigned in order for the device to allow inputs on some pins and send outputs on some. no need for specific lines but an example for a query and return value would be very much appreciated.

Negative 5990 pI have a div with webkitoverflowscrolling set to touch. On iOS this then gives me an updated position during the touchmove event, but once the user lets go this event ends and a final call to touchend is made before events all stop, but the div continues to momentum scroll.p  pThis is the behaviour I want, but I also want to update the page during this momentum scrolling.p  pI trigger a call to requestAnimationFrame when the touchend event happens, and I can loop this while the momentum scroll occurs. But when I get DOM information, its frozen until after the mometnum scroll ends.p  pIve tried using both the scroll position of the scrolling element and elementFromPoint, but both just have the position the scrolled div was in at the time touchend was triggered, and dont update until the momentum scroll ends.p  pDoes anyone know of any way to get real time DOM information on iOS 6, not worried about 5p  pHeres some code Im usingp  precodevar glideStart var birdscanner  document.getElementByIdbirdscanner birdscanner.addEventListenertouchend,function      glideStart  null     requestAnimationFrameglide   function glidetimestamp       if we need to reset the timestamp     if glideStart  null               glideStart  timestamp            determine if weve moved     var birdscanner  document.getElementByIdbirdscanner      console.log document.elementFromPoint337,568        calculate progress keep running for a very long time so we see what happens when momentum ends     var progress  timestamp  glideStart     if progress lt 10000               requestAnimationFrameApp.Controller.bird.glide       codepre  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter a stronglotstrong of attempts at this, I think it really is impossible without using some library to try and mimic the momentum scroll instead of using the built in option something I find never really gives as smooth results. Apple are clearly very worried about things interfering with their momentum scroll animation and preventing it rendering properly.p  pI ended up removing the momentum scroll and just detecting swipes and moving through a bunch of elements at once when thats triggered.p  pI did notice some particularly strange behaviour. When I had webkitoverflowscrolling touch set on an element that was scrolling the page updown and added a setTimeoutsomefunc,0 to the touchend event, the function wasnt triggered until the momentum scroll ended. When I tried the same thing on a scroll going leftright it triggered the function straight away. No clue why this happens, decided it must just be some strange webkit quirk.p

Negative 5990 pI was trying to write a simple camera app, but I ran into quite a frustrating problem with my picture preview. It shows horizontal flicker lines running up the screen. My screen has a width of 800 Galaxy SII plus, so there are black spaces on the edges the activity is set to horizontal orientation. Now these black margins begin to transition to a whitegrey at the bottom ends when the flicker occurs, so I suspect there might be something drawn over them.

Negative 5990 pMy experiance with normal archive types for data such as zipgzip7ziplzmaetc.. dont do a good job of image compressionp  pI was wondering if there exists image compression that allow for a very high compression ratio for long term storage, in which the image doesnt need to contain enough data to preview or look at the picture, just ensure that the data is reproducable to a normal jpegpngp  pWhen searching for image compression algorithms, google basically only returns jpeg,png,gif,bitmap. As far as I understand these image types are for compressing images that need to be viewable in their compressed format. But if you didnt need to view it the image when its compressed could you achieve a higher compression ratio.p  pThanksp

Negative 5990 pstrongEditstrong This question relates to the old google spreadsheets that were current in 2013.p  pIs it possible to use strongnamed ranges in google spreadsheet chartsstrong p  pI need to dynamically update the dimension starting position and size of a range and be able to reflect it in a chart, i.e. I need the chart source range to strongfollowstrong the position of strongmovedstrong source data range.p  pstrongExtra informationstrongp  pIve got two sheets. One has a header followed by input row and data rows. When I type anything into input row my script automatically adds a row just after this one and moves my new input there, therefore creating new row of data. p  pAbout chart If I assign a data range that includes only data rows, new row wont be included because whole old range got shifted.  sign is ignored when specifying data range. So what Im doing is to include in the range my input  1 header row. They have no values so in the chart you cannot see data points in the first two positions. Im using a strongcombo chartstrong with another range from another sheet that has no header, so it looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNYeIK.png altenter image description herep  pemusually there is some value for the green histogram right at the origin of the chartem.p  pSo the line chart is shifted by two positions to the right, but it should start from position 0, so I want the chart to somehow follow the range or to redefine it, so it always stars from the first data row.

Negative 5990 pIn studying the internals of the CLI, I notice that it is possible for type signatures to specify array bounds at compile time.  For instance, instead of havingp  pcodeByte[,]codep  pWe can havep  pcodeByte[1...100,1...]codep  pIf I am not mistaken it is not possible to actually declare types like the latter in either C or CCLI.  Furthermore, ECMA335 indicatesp  blockquote   pThe VES creates one array type for each distinguishable array type. In general, array types are only distinguished by the type of their elements and their rank.p blockquote  pThe Common Language Specification CLS imposes a number of restrictions, includingp  blockquote   pOnly the fact that an item is an array and the element type of the array shall be   required to distinguish between overloads.p blockquote  pSo it seems that support for compiletime array bounds is present at the lowest levels of the CLI but not elsewhere.  This leads me to wonderp  ul lipWhen would a type signature including this information ever be createdencountered in practice  Are there .NET languages that emdoem emit this  EDIT There are languages that probably emdoem use onebased arrays normally  but do they encode this into the type signaturespli lipWhere does the CLI actually emuseem this information if it emisem present  This in particular is of interest to me as Im designing a CLI implementation.pli ul  pAs far as I can see, any array is created either using the codenewarrcode bytecode instruction for vectors, or codeArray.CreateInstancecode for the general case.  Neither of these mechanisms accept a type signature for emthe array itselfem, so creation it seems cannot use this information.p  pTheoretically, this information could be useful to optimize array access by inlining efficient machine code to compute the address.  However, codeldelemcode and friends only access simple vectors multidimensional array access requires a method call, which makes me think such an optimization probably doesnt take place.p  pI have to think there is some purpose for this mechanism, in order for it to have made it into an international standard, but Im not really seeing it.p

Negative 5990 pIve developed web applications in PHP for a few years and would like to learn about ASP.Net. Ive installed VS2013 and have created an ASP.Net Web Application. I tried playing around with something that I found on emwait for item W3Schools just because I knew it would be as simple as simple could be but it caused me some errors. I was trying to connect to an Access file in the wwwroot directory by using System.Data.OleDb but I had some problems.p  pMy question is Is there a simplistic way like in PHP where you have PHPMyAdmin to manage the database and then connect via something simple like conn  new mysqlilocalhost, user, password, db but for ASP.Netp  pIm struggling to find beginner level support for this on the web and would like to figure it out asapp

Negative 5990 pI am trying to filter an NSArray of objects according to values in a specific key. My objects have a date when they were created, so basically, I want to create objects for three months, but show only one per week, therefore, I need to filter the results to show the objects according to the date. p  pI have a database with all the information I need to create these objects. My first idea was to create a period key in this database, specifying how long the object will be available. For example, object 1 would have the number 604800 timeInterval for one week in the periodkey. Now, for retrieving these objects, I would need to compare two keys, the createdAt, which is an codeNSDatecode, and the timeInterval which would be a codeNSNumbercode.p  pI tried to create two codeNSDatecodecolumns in my table and use predicate code[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatstartDate lt  AND endDate gt , today, today]code, and although I would have a lot more work to create the objects with these two added columns, the mentioned predicate didnt work, Im not sure why. p  pAnyway, Im looking for a simple solution and some code as well. p

Negative 5990 pI am creating a music software using jack, that has multiple outputs 16.

After that, Ardour cpu usage jumps to 8095 and causes everything to slow down into unusable, even if my prog is not processing much anything. This doesnt make any sense as puredata instances with the same or higher amount of jack outputs are not causing similar cpu loads to ardour empty or even full with plugins.p  pIn my program, all outputs are processed in the same jack callback function, is this the correct way of doing it for multiout  What could be causing this cpu peak  I am using rt kernel on linux test machine and my programs gui is drawn with SDL. p  pIt is starting to be very cool program, but this problem makes it kinda unusable.p

Negative 5990 pI have recently started messing around with LWJGL and I was making a little game to test some stuff in. I wanted to try to make an EXP bar and thought that it would be fairly easy.

Negative 5990 pIve been posed a very specific challenge at work and I havent been able to come up with a satisfying solution with my own research so I figured Id ask here in case someone else had a similar experience.p  pBasically Im about to start coding an app that serves as some kind of hub for events, the user would be able to find the event theyre interested in, select it and see the details about itinteract in what would essentially be its own microapp.br   The problem is I also need to be able to easily take the model general UI logic, common resources  and procedure etc. for this microapp and turn them into a standalone app dedicated to a single event with minimal effort it needs to be done by a noncoder with the help of some setup instructions so not via actually coding it but not one click youre done either.p  pI tried using sub projects, specifically having a sub project that constitutes the mini app be included inside the hubs project, but I cant figure out how to share resources between the two.br  I tried creating a simple test app that loads a UIViewController from the subproject and while I was able to have the parent recognize the headers I was not able to load resources namely a storyboard.p  pIm researching the use a static library maybe using an Xcode template to simplify the process for a non coder as I understand it would let me pack resources as well, but it seems like theyd make development harder by obscuring whats inside the library especially if I wanted to work on both the microapp and the hub at the same time so I was wondering if theres a better way that Im not aware of.p  pOf course I could just make a template once the code is finalized which would take care of the easy creation angle but then I would need to update the template every time something changes.p

I want it to be able to be moved just to the 4 adjacent fields not only by limiting the draglistener, I also dont want the object to be moved beyond this objects, no matter how far the finger tries to drag it.br I hope you get what I mean, if not please ask.br So this question is all about what I can do with this drag amp drop I guess. Is it possible to somehow detect where the finger is before dropping Is it possible to limit the dragging to the straight x and y axis Or is there a way to know the direction of that dragging movement, allowing me to 1 know the object I would swap with and 2 moving the other object before the drop, making it look like the objects are just swappingp  pstrongEditstrong I got the direction, since I can calculate it from codeview.getXcode, codeview.getYcode coords are inside my startobject and codev.getXcode and codev.getYcode coords from the object Im over in onDrag when the dragEvent is ACTIONENTERED.br Now I try to figure out either how to set the dragshadows position to the object I want it to be over, or to only allow dragging in my direction and ending the drag over the next object.br Further help or ideas still appreciated.p

It seems that the new SVN 1.8 feature of being able to keep using your feature branch after reintegration is not working in some cases.p  pIt is not working when the trunk contains local mergeinfo Mergeinfo on files or subtrees.

Also the error reports missing ranges of file1.txt while it seems to be file2.txt that is missing mergeinfo. While not a solution, deleting the local mergeinfo on file2.txt in the trunk also seems to fix the problem. This also hints that the error message is reporting something on the wrong file.p  pstrongEditstrong response to gbjbaanb This problem is more subtle than the one you are pointing to  even though the error message is the same. In my case it is not the reintegrate to the trunk that is failing but the reuse of the branch afterwards. p  pAlso if I look at the mergeinfo of both file1.txt and file2.txt it seems file2.txt is missing the mergeinfo record of featurebranch2 so the problem is with file2.txt not file1.txt as the error suggests. Because file1.txt was changed in the trunk during the life of featurebranch2 and file2.txt wasnt the mergeinfo about the trunk wasnt set on file2.txt during the merge in step 8. I believe this is the spot where it starts to derail. This will not impact the reintegrate to the trunk but it does prevent feature branch reuse afterwards.p  pstrongEditstrong response to David W Ive tried the emrecordonly c 11em and this also works on the Windows side. I had already tried it without emcem normaly you shouldnt, I know, but in this case there are no other changes and then it reportsp  precodesvn E200004 The required merge is reintegratelike, and the recordonly option  cannot be used with this kind of merge codepre  pFor good measure I also tried emrecordonly c 111em which what I expected would be the same as not using emcem as 11 is HEAD. My initial expectation was that it would fail the same way as not using emcem, but it didnt. It succeeded the same way as emc 11em.p  pBut the whole point of my post is that with SVN 1.8 we dont need to do keep alive trickery. The DRAFT documentation saysp  blockquote   pIf you choose not to delete your branch after reintegrating it to the   trunk you may continue to perform sync merges from the trunk and then   reintegrate the branch again[37]. If you do this, only the changes   made on your branch after the first reintegrate are merged to the   trunk. a hrefhttpsvnbook.redbean.com relnofollowhttpsvnbook.redbean.coma.p blockquote  pAnd from the Subversion 1.8 release notesp  blockquote   pMerging toandfro between two branches in any order is possible using   the automatic reintegration merge the keepalive dance is no longer   necessary. For best results, it is recommended to always merge all   eligible revisions, i.e. not using the r or c options of svn merge.   Merging just a subset of eligible revisions increases the likelihood   of problems during future   merges.a hrefhttpssubversion.apache.orgdocsreleasenotes1.8.html relnofollowhttpssubversion.apache.orgdocsreleasenotes1.8.htmlap blockquote  pSo my point is that this branch reuse without the keep alive trickery clearly doesnt work in the face of local mergeinfo and my script seems to show that.p  pIf you still feel that the warning about the missing ranges could be correct, except for maybe the reported range numbers, please show me where in my script I cause a missing range. My script is a simple back and forth between trunk and branch strongwithoutstrong parallel work on both of them.p  pAlso could you explain why also modifying file2.txt by adding emecho Additional file contents created in the trunk.  trunkfile2.txtem to step 7, will result in not having an error in step 10. Modifying an aditional file on the trunk cant solve a missing ranges problem.p

Negative 5990 pI have this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netthechrisjordanp4Fwm11 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netthechrisjordanp4Fwm11a, where Im manipulating a d3 pack layout with an HTML5 slider. Everything is working as I would like except for how the nodes are ordered when updateVis is called. p  pThis code is pretty straight forward Im creating the layout, and then the slider emits an event which causes the layout to update.p  pWhat Im hoping to achieve is this same behavior but to have the child nodes remain in their same general areas in the pack as they change size. As you can see, they reposition themselves here.p  pIt looks like my issue is line strong69strong where codepack.nodesdatacode is called. Ive dug into d3 source but cant figure out how to prevent this reordering and it may very well not be possible....p  pI suppose an alternative would be to try and squeeze the pack layout into a force layout.p  pIm brand new to d3 and am grateful for any insight here.p

Negative 5990 pLets say I have a MySQL database, with a table sessiondata containingp  precode ID  SESSIONKEY  SECRETDATA  100 ABCDEFGHIJK  bankAccountNumber123123 codepre  pNormally, users would have to authenticate with their session key codeABCDEFGHIJKcode, before the web application would charge their bank account number. In other words, the only time the application would have a legitimate reason for needing the codebankAccountNumbercode is if a valid session key is supplied.p  peg.p  precodeSELECT SECRETDATA FROM sessiondata WHERE SESSIONKEY  ABCDEFGHIJK LIMIT 1 codepre  pThus, I know if someone tried to do codeSELECTcodeSECRETDATAcodeFROM sessiondatacode or codeSELECT  from sessiondatacode its probably a malicious user who somehow found a hole in my application.p  pthis is a hypothetical example and I do not actually do this.p  pSo, to limit the amount of damage they can do, I would like to add a filter to my MySQL database.p  pThus, assuming an attacker managed to get my applications SQL credentials, the MySQL database would itself reject any query for codeSECRETDATAcode that was not accompanied by any codeSESSIONKEYcode. The credentials would still be useless to an attacker trying to gain information, since he wouldnt be able to query the database and have it return any useful information without submitting a codeSESSIONKEYcode, and if he submitted an invalid codeSESSIONKEYcode, thered simply not be any resultant rows and if he submitted a valid codeSESSIONKEYcode, he might as well just have used my applications publicly available interface anyways and authenticate as a legitimate user.p  pHow would I implement such a filter, short of writing a stored procedure which at this point is unfeasible Ive heard of MySQL Proxy, but Im not too sure if its capable of doing this.p

Negative 5990 pI have 2 codelistscode that have objects of code DT date, Value double code. p  pI want to join on date and subtract the 2 values. However, sometimes one list wont have any records for a given DT in which case Id want to just use the value from the list that does. However, because Im joining what ends up happening is I get no record at all for that DT. Is there any way to represent this using sql like linqp  pI know I could loop over 1 list myself and search for that date in the other, but if I could do it all in 1 linq line it just seems cleaner.p

Negative 5990 pI have developed a a hrefhttpsysandersson.azurewebsites.netmaterial.aspx relnofollowwebsitea in ASP.NET that can add articles into a another table that shows a product. p  pI have a table that displays items in a warehouse and a table showing the materials required to produce a certain product. Using a drop down list you can see which products are manufactured. When the user wants to add to the article, he pushes a button. But after the page loaded on my dropdown list shows the lowest value again instead of keeping its value. Visit the site, change the product produkt in swedish from Cykel bicycle to car and add any article and you will understand the problem. Can I do something with page load to find a solution p  pstrongMaybe I should mention that I use a datasource that Im binding the dropdown with.strongp
Negative 5990 pI have an old web form that is quite extensive with a lot of controls on it.  Id like to make a list of all the controls on it and what types they are, but I was hoping Visual Studio would have something similar to SQL Servers codeINFORMATIONSCHEMAcode table or codesys.code.  Does anyone know if Visual Studio has a similar feature It doesnt have to be a table  it could be a comma separated list, etc.  Web searches have turned up ways to pull controls via code, but I was really wanting something quicker.p  pEDITp  pSo it seems the general consensus is that this type of functionality doesnt exist in Visual Studio and getting those controls must be done programmatically.  servergta s answer seems to be the easiest alternative with the one modification of moving the initial declaration of the codeStringBuildercode outside of the method to keep it from resetting every time it calls itself.p  pThanks to everyone who gave an answerp

Negative 5990 pI have a PostgreSQL before insert trigger on create that basically redirects inserts into subtables. Once I insert the record, I want to ABORT the request as to avoid duplicate data by not inserting into parent table so I am using return NULL in the trigger. The problem is that I need the record to be returned so I can get the ID. If I return NULL, I get NULL.p  pThe above problem is discussed at below link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7948794postgresqltriggernotreturninganything2404418624044186PostgreSQL trigger not returning anythingap  pOne of the answers says to insert into parent table by not returning null but return new and use AFTER insert trigger to delete it from parent table. But I am looking at 1000 writes per second and this may be a serious issue on performance because of the deletes.is there any other way to do thisp  pTo be exact is there a way to return the id of a inserted row without inserting into the parent table and deleting it later.p

Negative 5990 pHow to customize the cq5 workflow inbox message payload from a java classp  pBasically i have a custom workflow for which have a launcher to trigger the workflow on ntunstructured node creation.

Negative 5990 pI have a class that is inherited from QThread lets called it ClassA that is running in a for loop like followingp  precodeforint i0iltsomenumberi      ClassA classa  new ClassA      classagtexecute  just a normal direct function call      classagtexit     classagtdeleteLater  codepre  pThe problem is that the classa contains a lot of memory, and it does not seem being destroyed while the loop is still running. So the program will crash soon after the memory has built up like memory leak. I tried to use delete classa as well which of course will crash the program. p  pAnybody know how to properly run and delete such class in a loop so it wont be occupying memory constantly.p  pThe for loop also sits in another thread. So there is a thread hierarchy where event loop might be key in calling deleteLater The code is a bit too complex to write up, but the quickest answer I want might be how to delete the Qthread object properly in a threading environment i.e. using eventloop properly so there is no memory leak or more like memory building up as the Qthread object is not deleted p
Negative 5990 pI have a table userplaystrack that keeps track of how many times a user has played a track. p  pI use the following query to either insert a new track a user has played, or update the number of times an existing track has been playedp  precodeINSERT INTO userplaystrack userid, trackid VALUES x,y  ON duplicate key UPDATE playcount  playcount1 codepre  pHere is the structure of my tablep  precodeuserid  trackid  playcount 1        5         2 4        2         1 3        5         7 codepre  pFrom this information, I can infer things such as the total number of times a track has been played, or the total number of plays an artist has had, by finding the sum of all the track counts.p  pWith a thousand or so records, this would soon become messy and the semantics unclear. What I wish to do, is use triggers to produce what could be described as cache.p  pFor example, when a record is updated or inserted into userplaystrack, the tracks table will increment its playcount column, indicating the total number of plays from all users for that track. p  precodetrackid  artistid   trackname  playcount 2         1           Hey         1 5         1           Test        9 codepre  pFurthering this, another trigger should be applied, to infer new knowledge such as the total number of artist plays. This would again be triggered when a new track is added, it will find the artistid the track belongs to and update the artist table accordingly.p  precodeartistid  artistname playcount 1          Bob         10 codepre  pHow would I go about implementing the relevant triggers, to provide a incrementing totals when a user plays a trackp

Negative 5990 pIm pretty new to AngularJS so hopefully this is easy, I have the following HTML where I am trying to check if a current page is equal to zero and if so, I changed the class name of the tag to disabled. currentPage is defined to be zero in my controllerp  precodeltscriptgt     if currentPage  0          document.getElementByIdprev.className  disabled          if currentPage gt eventslist.length  pageSize  1          document.getElementByIdnext.className  disabled      ltscriptgt codepre  pHowever, whenever I try to do a check like this, it never sees currentPage as zero. So then I added an else statement just to see what currentPage actually is.p  precodeltscriptgt     if currentPage  0          document.getElementByIdprev.className  disabled      else          document.getElementByIdprev.innerHTML  currentPage          if currentPage gt eventslist.length  pageSize  1          document.getElementByIdnext.className  disabled      ltscriptgt codepre  pAfter doing this, sure enough, it does come back as zero. Any ideas why the if statement fails on something so simple Thanks in advancedp
Negative 5990 pFirst of all, excuse me if I write a lot, I tried to summarize my research so that everyone can understand.p  pR. BaezaYates and M. Regnier published in 1990 a new algorithm for searching a two dimensional mm pattern in a two dimensional nn text. a hrefhttpwww.docdroid.netfileviewdz9odownload.pdf relnofollowThe publicationa is very well written and quite understandable for a novice like me, the algorithm is described in pseudocode and I was able to implements it successfully. p  pOne part of the BYR algorithm requires the AhoCorasick algorithm. This allows to search occurences of multiple keywords in a string text. However, they also say that this part of their algorithm can be greatly improved by using AhoCorasick not, but CommentzWalter algorithm based on BoyerMoore rather than KnuthMorrisPratt algorithm. They evoke an alternative to the CommentzWalter algorithm, alternative that they themselves developed. This is described and explained in a hrefhttpwww.docdroid.netdz9rbyr90.pdf.html relnofollowtheir previous publicationa see 4th chapter.p  pThis is where my problem lies. As I said, the algorithm goes through the text and check if it contains a word from the set of keywords. The words are arranged upside down and placed in a tree. To be efficient, it will sometimes be necessary to skip a number of letters, when he knows that there is no match found.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPvNoN.png altTriep  pTo determine the number of characters that can be skipped, two tables codedcode and codeddcode have to be computed. Then, the algorithm is very simplep  blockquote   pThe algorithm works as followsp      ul   liWe align the root of the trie with position m in the text, and we start matching the text from right to left following the corresponding   path in the trie.li   liIf a match is found final node, we output the index of the corresponding string.li   liAfter a match or mismatch, we move the trie further in the text using the maximum of the shift associated to the current node means dd, and the   value of d[x], where x is the character in the text corresponding to   the root of the trie.li   liStart matching the trie again from right to left in the new position.li   ul blockquote  pMy problem is that I do not know how to compute the codeddcode function. In their publication, R. BaezaYates and M. Regnier propose a formal definition of itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPjPWk.png altdd functionp  ppi is a word among the set of keyword, j is the index of a letter in this word, so pi[j] is like a node in the previous trie I showed. Number in the node represented ddnode. L is the number of words, and mi is the number of letters in the word pi.p  pThey give no indication concerning the construction of this function. They only recommend to watch a hrefhttpwww.docdroid.netdzazrytter1980.pdf.html relnofollowthe work of W. Ryttera. This document builds a function similar to that expected, the difference being that in this case, there is only one keyword and not a set.p  pThe definiton of dd called D here, is as followp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comij7r2.png altD functionp  pIt may be noted similarities with the previous definition, but I do not understand everything.p  pThe pseudocode for the construction of this function is given in the paper, I have implemented it, here in Cp  precodeint pattern[]   1, 2, 3, 1    I use int instead of char, simpler  const int n  sizeofpattern  4 int D[n] int f[n]  int j  n int t  n  1  for int k  1 k lt n k     D[k1]  2  n  k   while j gt 0      f[j1]  t     while t lt n          if pattern[j1]  pattern[t1]              D[t1]  minD[t1], n  j             t  f[t1]                  else              break                   t  t  1     j  j  1   int f1[n] int q  t t  n  1  q int q1  1 int j1  1 int t1  0   while j1 lt t      f1[j1  1]  t1     while t1 gt 1          if pattern[j1  1]  pattern[t1  1]              t1  f1[t1  1]                  else              break                   t1  t1  1     j1  j1  1  while q lt n      for int k  q1 k lt q k          D[k  1]  minD[k  1], n  q  k          q1  q  1     q  q  t  f1[t  1]     t  f1[t  1]   for int i  0 i lt n i      cout ltlt D[i] ltlt    codepre  pIt works, but I do not know how to expand it for several words, I do not know how to coincide with the formal definition of codeddcode given by BaezaYates and Rgnier. I said that the two definitions was similar, but I do not know to what extent.p  pI did not find any other information about their algorithm, it is impossible for me to know how to implement the construction of codeddcode, but I am looking for someone who could perhaps understand and show me how to get there, explaining me the link between the definitions of codeDcode and codeddcode.p

Negative 5990 pIve created a program that scatters three subclasses of point randomly across a 100 x 100 grid sugars, ants, and spiders. The ants move towards the sugar, and the spiders move towards the ants, and when the ants have eaten all the sugar, they run away from the spiders. I have a while loop that moves the ants at most one unit and the spiders at least two units every turn. The ants are inevitably all consumed, which terminates the while loop. Now, Id like to represent this program visually with a GUI, and Im not sure how to go about doing it. Im pretty sure I need to set the pane layout to null so that Im not forced to use only one object per area. Beyond that, Im not too sure.p  pIll post all the code, but its a bit verbose. What I really want to know is how to represent all the instances of all these types of points at once, and how to move them according to the principle of the game class while loop by itself, without a human clicking next turn, all the way until there are no ants left.p  precodepublic class Sugar extends Point  private double calories  private double calories private boolean eaten private int

Negative 5990 pIm new to angular and Im looking for the right way to implement the following idea.

Negative 5990 pWhile questions of this sort have been frequently asked, I think I have a more specific constraint that makes the problem a little more interesting. I am writing a clientside application in Dart using an MVC pattern. My goal is simple listen for clicks on a button, trigger an async request to a backend API, and present that data to the user.p  pMinimally, I have one each of a model, view, and controller class. The model class implements methods to make requests and bundle up the data it receives. The view class has the DOM subtree of interest as a field and implements methods to manipulate the elements therein. The controller has a single instance each of the model and view classes as its fields and registers event handlers on the elements of the view. The controllers event handlers fire off calls to the model to make requests and return data, which will then be passed to the view for rendering.p  pThe issue arises when I attempt to capture the incoming data from the async request into an instance variable of the model. Id like to keep everything nicely encapsulated thats why Im using Dart in the first place, and Id like to avoid using a global variable to hold the data that comes from the async request. A minimal example of my current layout looks something like below. Ive made all of the fields and methods public here for claritys sake. p  pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecode view.dart class FooView     The root element of the view with which were concerned.   static final Element root  querySelectorthisView    FooView  init     void init  root.hidden  false      Appends the new data into an unordered list.   void updateListltMapltString,Stringgtgt list      UListElement container  root.querySelectoruldataContainer     container       ..hidden  true       ..children.clear     for  MapltString,Stringgt item in list         container.appendnew LIElement         ..id  item[id]         ..text  item[text]            container.hidden  false       model.dart class FooModel     Instance variable to hold processed data from the async request.   ListltMapltString,Stringgtgt dataList     Makes async request, returning data to caller.   ListltMapltString,Stringgtgt getData      HttpRequest       .getStringexample.comapiendpoint       .then String data          dataList  JSON.decodedata            return dataList        controller.dart class FooController    FooModel model   FooView view    FooController      model  new FooModel     view  new FooView       void registerHandlers       When this button is clicked, the view is updated with data from the model.     ButtonElement myButton  view.root.querySelectormyButton     myButton.onClick.listen Event e        view.updatemodel.getData          codepre  pThe errors Im seeing involve the codemodel.dataListcode field coming up codenullcode at the end of all of this. My first blush is that I do not understand scoping of callback functions. The way I first understood it, the callback would handle the requests data when it arrived and just set the instance variable when it was ready. Perhaps the instance variable is aliased and modified within the scope of the callback, but the variable I want to return is never touched.p  pI have thought about passing a codeFuturecode object to a method of the view, which will then just do the processing itself and add the elements to the DOM as a side effect. That technique would break my MVC design even more than its broken now in this minimal working example.p  pIt is also very possible that I am using asynchronous programming completely incorrectly. Thinking more on this, my async call is useless because I basically make a blocking call to codeview.updatecode in the controller when the event fires. Maybe I should pass a request codeFuturecode to the controller, and fire the requests codethencode method from there when the event handler is triggered.p  pstrongIn Dart, in what scope do callback functions reside, and how can I get data out of them with minimal side effects and maximal encapsulationstrongp  pemN.B. I hate to belabor this oftdiscussed question, but I have read previous answers to similar questions to no avail.emp

Negative 5990 pI have a JRubyRails app that needs to get data from a system written in Java. I have already worked out how to call Java code from Ruby.p  pHowever, lets say that the Client object I need to create, starts threads, communicates with the internal system etc, and that the data is delivered asynchronously in callbacks.p  pDo I have to write a separate web service that creates this Client with a permanent connection to the Java system In such a way that my RubyRails code can call it synchronously. Or is it possible to write this asynch handler directly in Railsp  pWhen multiple HTTP clients issue their GETs, I would of course have to connect to the Java system when the first client arrives. For the following clients, the data would already be there.p  pI realize what the proper solution would be, but Im curious whether I can do it all in Rails.p  pI can for now live without the realtime updating of the webpage, as long as the data in the Java callbacks are stored somewhere so that the next HTTP refreshGET can return it. Nest step would be SSE, Javascript etc.p  pI think I know how to create the Java web service, however I would rather keep the solution a bit simpler with fewer services.p  pThanksp

These hyperlinks uses nghref to link to the related detail pagep  precodelta nghrefdetail3gtDetail 3ltagt codepre  pAfter that, I run all the Angular js files and all the nghref hyperlinks created before are correctly compiled.p  pWhen for istance I do an action in the jqGridUI, like going to page 2 or sort the grid by a specific column, jqGrid recreate the grid on the fly and I lost all the AngularJs ngref functionality.p  pIs there a way to tell AngularJS to recompile the DOM of a specific HTML element the jqGrid table in this casep  pCalling it at any jqGrid loadComplete event could be the correct way or maybe it would be better to have AngularJs that scan the DOM for changes any n seconds and recompile it if  the DOM has changedp

Negative 5990 pProblem  When my coworker tries to push a new local branch to the repository, a new remote branch is not created. Instead, the commit from the local branch is pushed directly to the master branch.p  pExample Codep  precode git checkout b newBranch originmaster ltmake change to filegt  git commit amnewBranch commit message  git push origin newBranch codepre  pInstead of getting the expected message ending withp  precode [new branch]      newBranch gt newBranch codepre  pmy coworker gets a message ending with thisp  precodedeee5b8..756bf15  newBranch gt master codepre  pI tested this exact process on my machine and it worked just as expected a new remote branch was created in the repository after the push. p  pThis behavior is repeatable across multiple repositories and happens every time he tries to push a new branch to the repo. If the branch already exists on the repo, the commit is pushed to the branch as expected. p  pIm assuming the difference is a setting or config option on my coworkers machine, but I have been unable to identify the culprit. Hoping someone else has run into this before. Just let me know if I left out any key information. Thanks.p
Negative 5990 pI am trying to find maximum amplitude value from PCM Buffer.p  pMy questions arep  p1 I found that to find this value in DB, formula is  amplDB20logabsampl32767.

Negative 5990 pI have a drupal site that is being used strictly as a CMS that produces JSON feeds using services and servicesviews, which are consumed by a separate site.  What I would like to do and I have a working proof of concept of this is allow for a live preview on the real site, by intercepting the node form preview  submit, encoding the node as JSON, and loading a special page on the live site that consumes that JSON and displays the page accordingly.p  pThe problem with this JSONized node is, its different from the JSON being produced by my view using servicesviews.  My end goal is to produce JSON that is identical for both previewed and nonpreviewed objects, without having to maintain separate output methods I could easily handcustomize the json but then when my view for the public api changes I have to make the same changes to the preview json.  Trying to avoid this.p  pIm looking for feedback on this approach.  Is what Im attempting even possible  The ideas Ive been able to come up with so far arep  ul libeing able to conditionally drive my view with data from a nondatabse sourceli lisneakily inserting data into the view object during one of the stages of execution Kludgy but Im not above that li lisaving a clone node or revision of the node being previewed and let the view use that to display the preview JSONli ul  pMaybe this is the wrong approach altogether and theres something better Trying to intercept and format the services output in my module... maybe avoid servicesviews altogetherp  pIf anyone can offer some advice, insight or opinions on how to best proceed here, Id be really grateful.p

However, having read mount2, it is unclear to me what restrictions if any there are on the arguments.p  pI particularly want to be able to mount disk image files as well as actual physical disks. And I also want to be able to mount individual filesystems by specifying an offset from the start of the device  image. I dont know whether you can do that with a single call to codemountcode, or whether you would need to manually create loop devices first. I also dont know how hard it is to create a loop device mdash I empresumeem its fairly easy...p  pIf setting this stuff up right is fairly complicated, then its probably simpler and easier to call the codemountcode binary. But if its just one system call, calling codemountcode directly seems cleaner. So which one is likely to give me the fewest problemsp
Negative 5990 pI am trying to click on a list entry.  My List is a custom list view, with the data pulled from an ArrayAdapter.

Negative 5990 pIs there any case where a Constructor returns something on purpose and it still makes sense to codenewcode itp  precodevar Fn  function     return this.fn  function   var a  new Fn var b  Fn codepre  pI cant seem to find any difference between codeacode and codebcode from console, but just in case I missed something, are they identical Apart from codebcodes side effect of adding codefncode as a method to codewindowcode object. And if theyre the same, does it mean that when a Constructor returns something, its no longer a Constructor and shouldnt be codenewcodeedp  pEdit, the reason Im asking is that Im working with Coffee and Angular at the moment, while both seem to be pretty sensitive about codereturncode, especially with providers.

Negative 5990 pI am writing an accessibility service.  Ive been trying to focus EditText fields in a way that pops up the software keyboard and I have been unsuccessful.  I am able to get the cursor into the EditText field, but the soft keyboard doesnt pop up.  Given EditTextNode is an AccessibilityNodeInfo that I have gotten from various accessibility events and that said nodeInfo isEditable, isFocusable, isVisibleToUser and isClickable when I attempt all of these actions and they all return true upon completion.p  precodeeditTextNode.performActionAccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTIONCLICK codepre  pIn my mind the above should simply work, and the fact that it does not is a bug in the Accessibility API, if not for my entire android version, at the very least on my device Droid Ultra, Android 4.4.4.  I have also triedp  precodeeditTextNode.performActionAccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTIONFOCUS codepre  pPuts focus into the field so I can see the input cursor, but no keyboard.p  precodeeditTextNode.performActionAccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTIONACCESSIBILITYFOCUS codepre  pDoesnt really do anything unless talkback is enabled.p  precodeeditTextNode.performActionAccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTIONSETSELECTION, someBundle codepre  pAlong with appropriate arguments this will work, but only if there is already text in the editText field.  I need to pull the keyboard up on empty text fields as well.  Yes, I tried inputing 0,0 for start and end text selection arguments.  The SETSELECTION method only works with text in the field p  pThis has been frustrating me for a couple days, hopefully you guys can help.  Though I believe Ive stumbled onto a bug and am going to have to wait for Android to update.  Because the ACTIONCLICK method should really be all that is needed.  But, I could be missing something silly, Accessibility API Doc is somewhat scant.  Am willing to attempt anything.p

Negative 5990 pAlrighty, so I have a pretty simple problem on my hands. I am given two inputs for my function a string that gives the formula of the equation and a structure that contains the information I need and looks like thisp  precode     Name      Symbol      AtomicNumber      AtomicWeight codepre  pTo find the molecular weight, I have to take all of the elements in the formula, find their total mass and add them all together. For example, lets say that I have to find the molecular weight of oxygen. The formula would look likep  precodeH2,O codepre  pThe molecular weight will thus be p  precode2Hydrogens weight  Oxygens weight, which evaluates to 18.015.  codepre  pThere will always be a comma separating the different elements in a formula. What I am having trouble with right now, is taking the number out of the stringthe formula. I feel like Im overcomplicating how I am going about extracting it. If theres a number, I know it can be in positions 2 or 3 depending on the element name.

Negative 5990 pI am busy with a text analytic project on masses of complaints data. One of the issues with the data is that you get multiple synonyms of the same word, e.g. bill, billing, billed, bills etc. Normally I would create a word frequency list and manually match the obvious ones and then apply the main word back to the original corpus for every synonym instance, e.g. billing, billed, bills  bill as it is all bill related. I have a nifty piece of code that someone on here helped me with. p  pRecently I have been playing around with the idea of using a string distance algorithm to make my life easier by identifying possible synonyms.

Negative 5990 pOnly the email portion isnt working because the codestubcode and codeusercode variables are lost between php pages or switches whichever they are. The tags close, then html begins, then a new set of php tags are opened. Now surprisingly, the codeSESSION[userid]code works great and that was set at the beginning of the file. Not sure why codestubcode and codeusercode do not work. I tried using codeSESSION[user]code for a new variable called globalstub and renamed that as well but negative on that one.

Negative 5990 pIm switching from AcrionBar to Toolbar and I noticed that I need to add Toolbar element in my layout XMLs. My question is that is it a good idea to have toolbar element in a separated XML layout and then include it in all my activity layouts so that I have central and unified way of customizing my toolbar Also having the java part of setting up of toolbar in a super class of my activities BaseActivity.java so I dont have to do it in every single activityp  pI thought of this but I wonder if there is any downsides in doing so since I dont have experience with Toolbar.p  pAny idea will be appreciatedp
Negative 5990 pI am playing around with MVVM and binding.

Negative 5990 pIm running this sample application of Stormpath Express Passport codehttpsgithub.comstormpathstormpathpassportexpresssamplecodep  pI cant wrap my head around how can you post a form and save customData or even the default data like the given name and surname. Overall I would appeciate if I could get a HTMLJade or EJS example with lines I need to write in codeapp.jscode or codeindex.jscode. Ive been struggling with this for 4 evenings.p  pIve tried multiple tutorials for Express, Stormpath, but none of them are meant to work with this sample application. I always had to install multiple new modules, but even that didnt get anything to work.p  pIve would highly appreciate if someone from Stormpath or really anyone who has experience with it, would help me with my problem and perhaps update their tutorials on the website as well, because some seem to be outdated.p

Negative 5990 pOk. i have seen my website in action with the html extensionson it, Now i am attempting to upload it to my local Xampp server so that i can attach PHP to it.  So now its definitely connected because i wrote a small script to print out information that was put into a form and the script worked. the only issue is that when i run the site from my editor the CSS is applied fine just how i wanted it. but when i run it from my localhost so that the script can be ran as well i lose my CSS and none of my links seem to be clickable or connected.  I have been reviewing PHP tutorials for 3 days now and i cant seem to get my Page to come up with THE CSS and all the links connected when going thru thru the xampp localhost. p  pi didnt think it was necessary to post up code that i know works but if that would help anybody help me then i will gladly post it. please just let me know. this is a crisis. i need you guys, please some one be my herop  precode ltheadgt     lttitlegt Black America Rising Web Radio lttitlegt     ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBARwebstyle.css typetextcss mediascreengt     ltlink relicon        typeimagepng        hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBar Mediagbtdmini.png width 16px height 16pxgt ltheadgt  ltbody backgroundCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBar MediaskyBG.jpggt      ltdiv classnavigationgt          ltnav classmainNavgt             ltulgt                 ltli classactivegtlta hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBARwebradio.phpgt HOME ltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBARPurpose.phpgt OUR PURPOSE ltagtltligt                               ltligtlta hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBARSchedule.phpgt SCHEDULE ltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBARArchive.phpgt ARCHIVE ltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBAROBFNews.phpgt OBF NEWS ltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBARYourVoice.phpgt YOUR VOICE ltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBARContact.phpgt CONTACT US ltagtltligt             ltulgt         ltnavgt            ltnav classuserNavgt               ltulgt                 ltligtlta hrefCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradiosubscribe.phpgt SUBSCRIBE ltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgt LOGIN ltagtltligt             ltulgt          ltnavgt     ltdivgt       ltdiv class sliderBoxgt         ltdiv classlogogt             ltimg  srcCUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBar MediaBlackAmericaRisinglogo.png altLogo gt         ltdivgt          ltsectiongt             lth4gt                 What became of the Black People of Sumer the traveler asked the old man,ltbrgt                  for ancient records show that the people of Sumer were Black.  ltbrgt                 What happened to them  Ah, the old man sighed.ltbrgt                 They lost their history, so they died.ltbrgt                                                             A Sumer Legend             lth4gt         ltsectiongt     ltdivgt     ltdiv class wrappergt         ltdiv class contentBoxgt             ltdiv classsideContentgt                 ltarticlegt                          lth3gtAbout the Host  Malik Greenlth3gt                         ltimg class profile src CUsersmenta000Documentsinternet talk showhtdocsBarwebradioBar MediamalikgreenProPic.jpg alt Malik Green profile picture gt                  ltbrgtMalik Green is the author of The BlackPrint  Black Americas Blueprint for Achieving Wealth, Prosperity and Respect and the founder of the Committee to Organize the One Black Family,                  an organization with a mission to inform, educate, inspire, and unite the Black people of America.

Mr. Greens ultimate goal is to help forge unity and love among our people which is paramount in quest to achieve wealth, prosperity and respect here in America and throughout the world.                   ltarticlegt             ltdivgt                 ltdiv classcontentgt                  lth3gtBlack America Rising Internet Radio Show   lth3gt                 ltpgt                     Its now time for us as a people to take responsibility for our own destiny.  We must realize that the only thing that can stop us, is us                       We must develop the plans, strategies, and organizational structure that will help us meet our challenges and put our people on a path                     of prosperity never realized in America.  Hoping and waiting for the opposition to bring forth solutions and resources to our people is somewhat delusional.                      History is a revealer of truth.  Our history in America has been a struggle to say the least from day one.                      What will it take for America to respect the Black people in America  Answer  When we stop relying on fiery speeches,                     protesting and denouncing injustices, relying on politics and politicians as our primary methods for the resolution of our challenges.                       These methods indicate weakness we can no longer be reactive and emotional when we are challenged by the opposition.                       The cry for jobs, justice, equality and fairness of opportunity portrays us an inferior people, who is always hatinhand.  We must educate our people about our history,                       our forefathers and their great achievements to mankind and the creators of the first great civilization.  We must inspire our people to reclaim the greatest of our ancestors,                      or else continue on this most dreadful path of selfdestruction.                  ltpgt              ltdivgt

Negative 5990 pI have been using the MPAndroidChart library to display a line graph of the currently playing audio in an app I am building.

Negative 5990 pI converted my scala project in eclipse to use Maven simply by right clicking on project and Configure Maven build, this created  pom.xml, added right dependency which pulled up required jars from maven repository but whenever i try to compile I dont see class file generating in targetclasses folder. However, i see actual source code which is scala files in respective directory under targetclasses folder. I am not sure why it is copying source files in targetclasses folder.  p  pAnother wierd thing, is if i open individual scala file in eclipse and do some code changes, then it automatically builds that class file, however i have 1000 scala files, so not a feasible option. p  pI tried all options such as Eclipse  Clean amp Build, but nothing works, i tried even using maven build inside eclipse but it always comes up with this message Nothing to compile  all classes are up to date, i cleaned up my target directory but still an issue. p  pI would appreciate any help in this regard. p  pThanks

Negative 5990 pIm trying to shift the objects in my partial array so that they get overridden, and everything gets shifted to the left. I know you can use an codearrayCopycode method, but Im trying to use a codeforcode loop to understand what an codearrayCopycode method even means. This was my first attemptp  precodeboolean search  false forint i  0 i lt numCourses  1  i   ifarrayCourses[i].getRegistration  crn    arrayCourses[i]  arrayCourses[1  i]  return search codepre  pHowever, I realize that the codeforcode loop searched for the codecrncode and then if it was equal to it, then it replaced it with the one greater than it and continued throughout the loop, so I still had the same number of courses at the end instead of replacing them. p  pSo I made something elsep  precodeboolean search  false forint i  0 i lt numCourses  1  i   ifarrayCourses[i].getRegistration  crn     forint j  i 1 j gt 0  j        arrayCourses[j]  arrayCourses[1  j]       return search codepre  pSo that it would search through the loop, start at the index and replace it with all the preceding objects in the array. But was I suppose to use a temporary variable to hold this instead I guess my problem is understanding where the second loop should have startedended.p

Negative 5990 pIve been searching for hours and tried tons of combinations, but have thus far been unsuccessful in my attempts. I have a folder on a remote FTP server whose contents I wish to display as links on a webpage. Upon clicking the link, I want it to download that specific file to the users computer. Ive spent hours trying jqueyajax combos with php and html mixed in. Any help would be much appreciatedp  precodeltphp     ftpserver  host info here     ftpuser  user info here     ftppass  pw here       set up a connection or die     connid2  ftpconnectftpserver or dieCouldnt connect to ftpserver       try to login     ftploginconnid2, ftpuser, ftppass     ftppasvconnid2, true      filelist  ftpnlistconnid2, folderpathhere     foreach filelist as file              echo file         echo ltbr gt          ftpcloseconnid2 gt codepre  pThat is the code before trying to link the files for download. This successfully lists all the files in the folder. I do not want to download all of the files to the local server everytime the page loads, since they are large files and theres a lot of them. I would like only to download them upon request via clicking the filename.p  pThe overall idea of what Im attempting is to pass the link text to a function which would open the FTP connection again and download the specified file. It would be awesome to download a copy directly to the clients computer upon clicking the link, but if I need to download to the local server first, that is an option, then Ill just clear it on page load.p  pWhat Ive tried Ive spent hours googleing jqueryajax scripts, tried functions in separate files and passing parameters to them, and more. Thus far, nothing has worked. While Im experienced in several coding languages, Im newer to phpjs, so any help is much appreciatedp  pThanks in advance for your time.p

Negative 5990 pSorry for the tortured title. But basically what we want to do is implement a simple scheduling mechanism in our app but we dont needwant the scheduler to actually execute the jobtask on schedule. We just want to ask the scheduler if the jobtask should be run, given a datetime instance.p  pSo ideally, we would be able to do something like thisp  precode assume cronstyle notation every hour on the 30 minute mark Schedule s  new Schedule30      Calendar c  new GregorianCalendar2015, 1, 18, 0, 30  1230 AM boolean shouldRun  s.shouldRunc  true  c  new GregorianCalendar2015, 1, 18, 0, 45  1245 AM shouldRun  s.shouldRunc  false codepre  pI see that Quartz has a JobExecutionContext and you can call getNextFireTime, which would kind of get us what we want. But as far as I understand it, wed still have to go through the definition of the job and then actually schedule it, which is all unnecessary for our purposes.p  pHope this question makes sense. Thanks in advancep
Negative 5990 pI was wondering if anybody knows how to achieve cell reuse with NSTableView on a column basis. So far Ive been able to get cell reuse on a row basis level with regards to NSTableView but thats about it. My intuition tells me that Ill have to implement a scrollable grid view with reusable views from scratch by extending the NSScrollView class and implementing the grid layout on top of it but I just want to make sure first that this columnbase reuse functionality is not supported by OSX. p  pThanksp  pJBp

Can somebody explain to me what Im doing wrong herep  precodeTest.elf   section              size         addr .text              0x102c     0x400000 .ARM.exidx            0x8     0x40102c .relocate           0x844   0x20000000 .bss                0x154   0x20000844 .stack             0x2000   0x20000998 .ARM.attributes      0x29          0x0 .comment             0x70          0x0 .debuginfo        0x57d1          0x0 .debugabbrev      0x1058          0x0 .debugaranges      0x430          0x0 .debugranges       0xb00          0x0 .debugmacro       0xf50a          0x0 .debugline        0x5024          0x0 .debugstr        0x46ec7          0x0 .debugframe        0xe04          0x0 .debugloc         0x31f1          0x0 Total             0x6a5a8      text    data     bss     dec     hex filename  0x1034   0x844  0x2154   14796    39cc Test.elf codepre  pThese are my CPP filesp  pMain.cppp  precodeinclude ltasf.hgt include ltMMA8652.hgt  extern C     extern void vApplicationStackOverflowHookxTaskHandle pxTask,           signed char pcTaskName         int mainvoid    const taskConfigt AccelTaskConfig   AccelRx, 3, 100     MMA8652 AcceleroAccelTaskConfig        return0  codepre  pTask.hp  precodeifndef TASKH  define TASKH include ltinttypes.hgt  typedef struct      char taskName     uint8t priority     uint16t stackSize  taskConfigt  class Task       private      public      Taskchar taskName, uint8t priority, uint16t stackSize     Task      friend void runhelpervoid arg          return staticcastltTaskgtarggtrun           virtual void runvoid const  0      protected    endif codepre  pTask.cppp  precodeinclude ltTask.hgt include ltasf.hgt  void runhelpervoid arg  TaskTask char taskName,              uint8t priority,              uint16t stackSize         check for minimal stacksize     ifstackSize lt configMINIMALSTACKSIZE          stackSize  configMINIMALSTACKSIZE            check priority val     ifpriority gt configMAXPRIORITIES          priority  configMAXPRIORITIES            create a new FreeRTOS task with func ptr to run member     xTaskCreate amprunhelper, const signed char  taskName,      stackSize, Taskthis, priority, NULL  codepre  pMMA8652.hp  precodeifndef MMA8652H define MMA8652H  include ltTask.hgt  class MMA8652 public Task   private  public     void runvoid const     MMA8652const taskConfigt amptConfig     MMA8652void    endif  MMA8652H codepre  pMMA8652.cppp  precodeinclude ltasf.hgt include ltMMA8652.hgt  MMA8652MMA8652const taskConfigt amptConfig           TasktConfig.taskName, tConfig.priority, tConfig.stackSize       void MMA8652runvoid const       piosetpinhighTESTLEDGPIO     vTaskDelay1000     piosetpinlowTESTLEDGPIO     vTaskDelay1000   codepre  plinkerscript.ldp  precode    OUTPUTFORMATelf32littlearm, elf32littlearm, elf32littlearm OUTPUTARCHarm SEARCHDIR.

Negative 5990 pI am currently using Weblogic 11g 10.3.6 i.e. Java EE 5. I have plugged in Jersey 1.9 using standard Weblogic shared library mechanism and able to use Path annotated RESTful classes.

Hence looking for help with these questionsp  pQ1 I am unable to inject EJB into my REST resources using EJB hitting a NPE. Is it not possible to do so or am I missing somethingp  pQ2 Assuming its not possible to inject an EJB into a REST resource, can I expose a Stateless session bean over REST by using Stateless and Path. I tried this and its failing with a Not Found response guess that means JAXRS is not able to locate the Resource class. Again, the question remains the same  is it not possible at all or are there any workarounds I can resort to p

Negative 5990 pNow I know this question exists on stack overflow but not in the way I plan to use it. p  pIm an IOS developer and I love being able to share internet from my phone to my iPad and Mac for when I travel. If i pay the extra 20 a month through strongATampTstrong for tethering I will lose my unlimited data.p  pOne of the popular answers or raised concerns is that apple will not accept an app that enables tethering. Well the thing is I would just like tethering on my iDevice and if it works out I would post the project to github so other developers can enjoy the benefits of nonjailbroken tethering. Also I would not try to publish it to the app store, i know it would get rejected.p  pSo my question is how do I write a tethering app, not like iProxy, but more like MyWi or TetherMe. br  Im pretty sure its possible because apps similar to that have slipped through apples reviewal process before.p

At first I am considering a fractional valued variable after applying LP and for 0 and 1 value I am considering SP1 and SP2 as my subproblems. for each SP1 I have UB1 and LB1 and for each SP2 I have UB2 and LB2 as mentioned earlier.

Is there any way in interface builder to set the autolayout constraint to be relative to the bigger of the two actually, to be more accurate, relative to the element with the largest maxY frame positionp

I select them using the id of the form concatenated with codeinput[typepassword]code and later on use code.setValuecode to insert some string into them.p  pThe problem is differentiating between these two password fields. I dont want to use the id or class to select them because I dont want it to be cssdependant in that way. This is because the test is for a live website that developers work on constantly and every time the css name changes the test will have to be modified if it is dependant on the id of elements instead of their type. I have no control over the many developers and what names they change and do not change. My only option is to write my tests as independently of the css as I can. If I can select the password fields using their type I will only be dependant on the form name which is used to select the password field, the user name field, and the login button.p  pIs there any way to do this Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5990 pI have an codeImageViewcode which can be zoomed using the codePhotoViewcode library. On application start I read a JSON file containing different image elements and I create a codeCanvascode on top of this codeBitmapcode in codeImageViewcode and draw all these mapimage locations on top of it.  p  pHowever I now need to draw a pointer on top of this bitmap which indicates users location and orientation which is received from magnetic sensors the problem is with one canvas I would have to erase everything from it and redraw it all again when I need to reposition the cursor or change its direction.  p  pAre multiple canvases possible for single codeBitmapImageViewcode if not whats my best option here p
Negative 5990 pI am attempting to set up a formula that will allow me to count the number of items in column A which have a corresponding codeSUMBnEngt0code where codencode is the row for that item. Conceptually for the exampled data shown below I would like to count the number of colors that make up my articles of clothing the formula for this example data would return code5code, since codeGreencode would not satisfy the criteria.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com30hO5.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com30hO5.png altexample data setap  pI have previously accomplished something like this by adding a separate column at the end of the data which checked if SUM  0, then counted from there. However, I am wondering if there is a more straightforward way to accomplish this and have personally failed to get a formula to work here. The only thing I can think of to try is codeCOUNTIFA2A7,SUMB2E2gt0code, or other varitaions on it, none of which have worked. I have also tried out using codeCOUNTIFScode e.g. codeCOUNTIFSB2B7,gt0,C2C7,gt0,...code, but this results in criteria working more like an codeANDcode statement, rather than an codeORcode which is essentially what Im trying to do here. p
