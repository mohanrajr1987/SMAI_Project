Positive 89007 pIm using angulars ngrepeat to present very large amounts of information. To handle this Ive started using a filter.p  pIm now trying to wrap it all in an angular directive that will handle paging by using a the ngrepeat and ngfilter, showing only X out of Y results. results 100, showing 2030.p  pIm trying to present it in a similar way youd encounter paging on an iPhone with the number of pages represented as dots and clicking causing an animated scroll to another page.p  pAs to my question, Im stumped at what would be considered an angularish way to solve my problem. The only real way I see to achieve this animation, is to render several divs, each with a certain width and perform a scroll between them. However, this doesnt really use the ngfilters capabilities. Ive also encountered the nganimate class, but not sure how to achieve a paging effect with it. p  pCould anyone please direct me to a correct angularish line of thought  solution p

Positive 89007 pI am using deckgrid in conjunction with a custom built infinite scroller to load a continuous stream of photos in Angular laid out in a masonry layout. The data set returned each time is quite large and I had noticed that deckgrid calls quickngrepeat on the data set to generate the cards. Deckgrid also places a watchCollection on the data set so when the data set changes triggered by appending data to the data set when user scrolls to the bottom, the ngrepeat will re render everything in the data set old and new data alike.p  pUnfortunately, re rendering each card is extremely expensive given the size of the data set and other post processing that my application has to do. I want to be able to leave the already rendered cards as is and only render new cards with the newly fetched data. In other words is there a way for ngrepeat to un bind on elements that have already been renderedp

So I assume this will have something to do with this behaviour.p  pWhat happens is when I modify the list, the ngrepeat registers the change and displays the DOM for the list item, but the content inside the item where I print the item name is no longer visible until I refresh the browserreopen the app.p  pSee the screens attached to visualise my problem.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comR6lCQ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR6lCQ.png altBeforeap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comSOxkB.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSOxkB.png altAnd afterap  pThanksp

Negative 89007 pI am doing my assignment in Network architecture 1, where I have to implement a distance vector routing at each node.p  pAt each node, I have a thread which listens for incoming codeDatagramPacketcodes containing routing information from neighboring nodes only on a specific port.

Negative 89007 pImagine this I have an PNG image that shows teddy bear, or a triangle. Something nonquadratic. Now, I want to find out, at which point for a given row and direction coordinates relativ to the UIImageViews coordinate system the actual visible image starts.p  pExample Lets say, I need to know where the feet of the teddy bear begins from the left, when looking at the last line. Sure thats not just frame.origin.x, because the feet is not quadratic. It may begin somewhere at x12.p  pI would iterate somehow over the image data and inspect the pixels Hey, are you transparent. And if it is, I go on to the next one. Hey, whats up with you Transparent. Until I get the result Nope Im totally opaque.

Negative 89007 pI have a fetched results controller with a predicate on my Thing entity that looks like this thingDomain.domainCurrentAccount NULL. It finds all of my Thing objects that are in the current domain. The current domain is defined by a onetoone relationship between the Account entity and one of the Domain entities. Each Thing belongs to one Domain, and each Domain has many Things. All Domains except one have a NULL relationship with the Account.p  pThis works and my tableview is happy.p  pLater I change the current domain by modifying the relationship with Account. I add more Things to a Domain that is now the current domain, they are added to the tableview since they satisfy the predicate. However the Things that belong to the now noncurrent Domain remain in the tableview even though they do not satisfy the predicate any more.p  pI tried refetching, but that had no effect, so I am puzzled as to what fetching again actually does. Does it reevaluate the predicate against the entitiesp  pI fixed the problem by deleting all the Things in the current Domain before changing the current domain, but feel that I should not have to do this. p

Negative 89007 pNot that Im in that situation currently, but Im just interested in the answer...p  pAssuming you have some code written in CC and you want to manually optimize it by modifying it in ASM.p  pWhat happens if you alter the code in CC and recompile from source. Sure, the optimization on the just compiled file is lost. How do you avoid that these optimizations need to be redone each time the project is compiled Do you create separate source files for the parts that need to be optimized to make it less complex Or is there some kind of automatic tool to do this... Guess you cannot use diffpatch for this...p  pPlease share your experiences, thanksp

Negative 89007 pThis is a conceptual question.p  pMany of the operations that happen in webOS are asynchronous. I have done Ajax programming before, but it feels like webOS takes it to a new level. Take the following example of an application that retrieves a list of news articles from the web, and also caches articles locally in an HTML5 storage databasep  precodefunction FirstAssistant    FirstAssistant.prototype.setup  function      this.controller.setupWidgetarticleList,         this.attributes   itemTemplate article ,         this.model             this.db  openDatabaseFooArticles, 1.0   FirstAssistant.prototype.activate  function      this.db.transactionfunctiontransaction         transaction.executeSql             CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS articles name TEXT, favorite INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             [], this.successHandler.bindthis, this.errorHandler.bindthis                   this.fetchArticles   FirstAssistant.prototype.successHandler  functiontransaction, results       SELECT from articles to populate this.model   FirstAssistant.prototype.errorHandler  functiontransaction, results       whatever   FirstAssistant.prototype.fetchArticles  function      var request  new Ajax.Requesturl,          method get,         onSuccess this.fetchArticlesSuccess.bindthis,         onError this.fetchArticlesError.bindthis        FirstAssistant.prototype.fetchArticlesSuccess  functionrequest       populate this.model with new articles   FirstAssistant.prototype.fetchArticlesError  functionrequest       whatever  codepre  pSo, because everything is asynchronous, we are attempting to create the database and read cached articles while we fetch new articles from the web. Because everything is done via callbacks, I have no confidence in what will happen first. The database knows which articles have been marked as Favorites, but depending on execution speed this.model may be empty because the db callback is executing first or it may have items in it because the AJAX returned first. So, each callback needs to be able to populate a list or iterate the list and do updates.p  pMy current project adds another layer of complexity because I am using a FilterList, adding another callback and model to the mix.p  pTo condense this into questionsp  ol liJavaScript is asynchronous, but is there only one thread of execution Do I need to worry about two functions editing this.model at the same timeli liWhat are some common ways of dealing with interdependent asynchronous operations ie. preventing duplication in this.model, where two sources may have overlapping data for the modelli ol

Negative 89007 pIn college, my senior project was to create a simple 2D game engine complete with a scripting language which compiled to bytecode, which was interpreted. For fun, Id like to port the engine to android. Im new to android development, so Im not sure which way to go as far as deploying the engine on the phone.p  pThe easiest way I suppose would be to require the engineinterpreter to be bundled with every game that uses it. This solves any versioning issues. There are two problems with this. One this makes each game app larger and two I originally released the engine under the LGPL license unfortunately, but this deployment strategy makes it difficult to conform to the rules of that license, particularly with respect to allowing users to replace the lib easily with another version.p  pSo, my other option is to somehow have the engine stand alone as an Activity or service that somehow responds to intents raised by game apps, and somehow give the engine app permissions to read the scripts and other assets to run the game. The user could then be able to replace the engine app with a different version possibly one they made themselves.p  pIs this even possible What would you recommend How could I handle it in a secure wayp

Negative 89007 pI have a searcher page with a sidebar with filter options and, when you change this options, the mid content updates via AJAX, matching the filter options criteria.p  pIn this same page, I have 6 spaces for putting OpenX Ads Zones.p  pIn order to always serving relevant content in this Zones, according to the searcher filters, I want to replace the zones with other ones via AJAX. So, if the user select, by example, Region 4 and Category 12, I will show the R4C12 zone.p  pMy problem here is I got a lot of categories and a lot of regions, so the number of combinations is huge. Also, Id need 6 times this number, for I get 6 spaces in the page. This is something like 3500 zonesp  pMy question is, is my approach correct or is there a better way for serving relevants and dynamics ads using OpenXp  pIf theres no a better way, I can use the API for creating this zones and that shouldnt be a problem. But then I need to know whats the limit of zones per publisher OpenX cant hold.p

E.g. for a map with three fields, the solution red, red, blue would have the same structure as blue, blue, red, just with different color names, and I dont want both of them displayed.p  pSo I thought I would have a dynamic predicate solution3, and call assertsolutionA,B,C at the end of my mapcolor predicate. And then, for each solution, check if they already exist as a solution3 fact.

And I cant think of a way to achieve this.p  pSo, the question is, what is the best way to assert a found solution and then make a unification test so that red, red, blue would unify with blue, blue, redp

Negative 89007 pI have a Zend Framework project that I started working on a a while back in Windows. It was run on Zend Server CE and everything worked fine. Moving it between Windows machines was no problem at all. But now I wanted to put it on a Ubuntu Server, still using Zend Server CE. But it started to complain about missing Controller Plugins. But they were located at the correct spot. I guess the autoloader is somehow getting confused.p  pFeels like it should be the fact that Windows uses caseinsensitive names on folders and files that be the cause. Which folders does Zend Framework need to have in the correct case Looking at standard project layouts lowercase names for folders are used. But looking at the Zend Framework itself capital first letters are used. Maybe together with the fact that the Zend Framework autoloader accepts singular class names on a plural form folder name likep  pcodeFormFoocode being located in codeformsFoo.phpcodep  pIn my project the main part of the project uses the standard lowercase style.p  piep  precodeapplication   modules     default       controllers       views       models       forms       plugins         controller           acl             Plugin.php   The class PluginControllerAclPlugin in this file is not found on Linux     foo       controlles       views       models       forms codepre  pBut then in my library folder I have a Core folder where I have my Core classes and on those I use the Zend Framework way of naming themp  precodelibrary   Core     Model       User.php  Contains the class CoreModelUser codepre  pQuick tests seem to indicate that Zend Framework is able to locate these classes just fine.p  pWhen in Zend Framework in Linux, where do you have to use correct case names for the autoloading to work Should one opt for first capital names throughout likep  precodeApplication   Modules     Default       Controllers       Views       ... codepre  pAny ideas and tips are welcome.p

Negative 89007 pAnyone have any ideas on how to do this I am new and need to know how to implement this assignment. Really need advice on starting out with this project, thanks.p  pHere is the codep  precodepackage code  import java.util.HashMap import java.util.LinkedList import java.util.List        This assignment involves character by character   processing, but this time the characters are not coming from a String, they   are coming from a file.      Because Javas file input classes throw various exceptions, which we do not   yet know how to handle, I am providing you with a class which deals with   those exceptions UBFileReader. This is an iterator for a file.   You will be able to use this class during your writeup, but its source will   be hidden from you.               Overall, the project is a review viewer for various products. The information   about the reviews and products will be stored in a text file in the following format   Products start with ltpgt and end with ltpgt   Reviews start with ltcgt and end with ltcgt   So given the input ltpgtMkayltpgtltcgtBrown and hairy.ltcgt   The product would be Mkay   The review would be Brown and hairy.      The products and reviews should be stored in a HashMapltString, LinkedListltStringgtgt   where the key is the product and the value is a linked list containing all of the   reviews for the product.      The products and reviews and then displayed in a beautiful light grey and yellow   graphical user interface. The user can use this to browse the available products   and read their reviews. The user interface will be supplied for you, so all you   need to take care of is putting the appropriate information in the HashMap.        public class TagFileParser              Reads a file identified by inputFilePath, one character at a time.       Products start with ltpgt and end with ltpgt as explained above.        Reviews start with ltcgt and end with ltcgt as explained above.       Any text not inside of one of these tags should be ignored.              You may use only CharacterFromFileReader to read characters from the       input file.              In order to simplify the code writing experience, it is recommended       that you use a switch statement where the case would be the state.       This way, you only need to worry about what happens when you are at       that state. You should, however, fully understand the state diagram       as a whole and in parts, as you will be required to complete this       assignment next week at the beginning of lab.              param String                  inputPath the path on the local filesystem to the input file       returns a HashMap containing the productgtlinked list of reviews mappings.            public HashMapltString, ListltStringgtgt fillHashMapString inputPath          return null        codepre

Negative 89007 pHi guys Im trying to create points inside a console window based on a 80x49 grid. But Im getting stuck on the basic idea and i thought i would ask here to see if Im on the right track atleast.p  pMy thought was to first of all print out spaces on the entire page so that later, when my method Draw is called, it replaces a space with a character of choosing.p  pKeep in mind that the application should be able to print out new points on the same canvas again and again, say that we first print a  at 4,5 and then a  at 4,7 so Im guessing SetCursorPos wouldnt workp  pRegardsp

Negative 89007 pIve been working on a clustered system for many years, and decided it is time we had a tool that let us query the plaintext logfiles among other things easily. I downloaded all the logfiles to an old test machine, where they take about 20 GB compressed, but would take 550 GB uncompressed partly due to many stack traces. We have different topics maintained by different people, and our log formats changed over the years. But lets just assume I could somehow turn it into a single consistent format across all topics.p  pMy question is Is there some freeopen source tool that I can just let loose on those files, and it will automatically recognize recurring similar log messages. As an example messagep  precodeUser John Smith has logged in from IP aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd. Duration zzz ms. codepre  pGiven many instances of such message, the tool would work out a pattern likep  precodeUser  has logged in from IP .

Negative 89007 pI am developing a fairly process hungry application which I need to take an image and save it every time a button is pressed. On pressing the button I trigger the codesetOneShotPreviewCallbackcode method of the camera object to get a codebyte[]code representing the image at that moment. At the moment after this I take this codebyte[]code and convert that to a bitmap using a YUVImage object which is very heavy on the processor. To reduce this I crop the image usingp  precodeRect rect  new Rect4w10, 0, 9w10, h final ByteArrayOutputStream outputstream  new ByteArrayOutputStream yuvimage.compressToJpegrect, 100, outputstream codepre  pI would like to know if I can do this only using the codebyte[]code and not have to convert it to the YUV Image like before the callback is triggered the Rect is created and the codebyte[]code is only populated with the image data inside that Rectp

I made a stripped down version of my service to show you. brbForegroundService.javabp  precodepackage service.App import android.R.drawable import android.app.Notification import android.app.NotificationManager import android.app.PendingIntent import android.app.Service import android.content.Context import android.content.Intent import android.media.RingtoneManager import android.net.Uri import android.os.IBinder import android.util.Log import java.io.IOException import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException import java.lang.reflect.Method import java.net.InetAddress import java.net.InetSocketAddress import java.net.Socket import java.net.UnknownHostException import java.sql.Date import java.text.SimpleDateFormat import java.util.Timer import java.util.TimerTask  public class ForegroundService extends Service  static final String ACTIONFOREGROUND  com.example.android.apis.FOREGROUND static final String ACTIONBACKGROUND  com.example.android.apis.BACKGROUND private static final Classltgt[] mStartForegroundSignature  new Class[] int.class, Notification.class  private static final Classltgt[] mStopForegroundSignature  new Class[]  boolean.class  private Method mStartForeground private Method mStopForeground private Object[] mStartForegroundArgs  new Object[2] private Object[] mStopForegroundArgs  new Object[1] private Timer timer  new Timer long interv10000 int timeout3000 Intent notificationIntent PendingIntent contentIntent Notification notification CharSequence text SimpleDateFormat df  void invokeMethodMethod method, Object[] args      try          mStartForeground.invokethis, mStartForegroundArgs      catch InvocationTargetException e          Log.wApiDemos, Unable to invoke method, e      catch IllegalAccessException e          Log.wApiDemos, Unable to invoke method, e        void startForegroundCompatint id, Notification notification      Scan     if mStartForeground  null          mStartForegroundArgs[0]  Integer.valueOfid         mStartForegroundArgs[1]  notification         invokeMethodmStartForeground, mStartForegroundArgs         return        void stopForegroundCompatint id      if mStopForeground  null          mStopForegroundArgs[0]  Boolean.TRUE         try              mStopForeground.invokethis, mStopForegroundArgs          catch InvocationTargetException e              Log.wApiDemos, Unable to invoke stopForeground, e          catch IllegalAccessException e              Log.wApiDemos, Unable to invoke stopForeground, e                  return        Override public void onCreate       notificationIntent  new Intentthis, ForegroundService.class     contentIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitythis, 0, notificationIntent,0     try          mStartForeground  getClass.getMethodstartForeground,mStartForegroundSignature         mStopForeground  getClass.getMethodstopForeground,mStopForegroundSignature      catch NoSuchMethodException e          return        Override public void onDestroy      stopForegroundCompatR.string.foregroundservicestarted      if timer  null           timer.cancel        Override public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId      handleCommandintent     return STARTSTICKY   void handleCommandIntent intent      if ACTIONFOREGROUND.equalsintent.getAction          text  getTextR.string.foregroundservicestarted          notification  new NotificationR.drawable.icon, text, System                 .currentTimeMillis          contentIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitythis, 0, new Intentthis,                 Start.class, 0          notification.setLatestEventInfothis,                 getTextR.string.localservicelabel, text, contentIntent          startForegroundCompatR.string.foregroundservicestarted,                 notification       else if ACTIONBACKGROUND.equalsintent.getAction          stopForegroundCompatR.string.foregroundservicestarted         Override public IBinder onBindIntent intent      return null    private void Scan      timer.scheduleAtFixedRatenew TimerTask           Override         public void run               Socket s  null             int p  81             long time             String urlwww.google.com             SimpleDateFormat df             InetAddress ipaddress                 try                       ipaddress  InetAddress.getByNameurl                      try                          s  new Socket                         s.connectnew InetSocketAddressurl, p, timeout                         time  System.currentTimeMillis                         df  new SimpleDateFormatyyyyMMdd HHmmss                         Log.iServer Monitor,                                 A server is running on port   p                                              IP address                                           ipaddress.getHostAddress                                          .

Negative 89007 pIm porting an existing android app to honeycomb and the fragments API and compatibility library. Im using the same layout, but Im loading it into a fragment.

If I change the background to a hex color, it covers the entire screen. This has never happened before switching to fragments and the layout did not change.

Negative 89007 pI have been designing a Java server, connected via PHP, that accepts a series of protein chains and performs computations on each of them. The computations are handled by external Perl scripts which return data to Java which is then inserted into a MySQL database. p  pJava successfully executes the Perl scripts and returns the data, the problem lies in MySQL inserting the data. Java seems to be throwing an OutofMemory exception running out of heap space. After Googling around most solutions seem to involve Increase the heap size, the problem with this is for 10 proteins chains increasing the heap size to 500MB seems to solve the problem but if 20 chains are entered again the heap size will have to increase and 1000 chains what the system should be able to handle increasing the heap size is not an option. p  pMy question is this. p  ul liWhat is a MySQL INSERT doing which is causing the heap to fill, and why is the JVM not cleaning up the excess data The MySQL query is not a prepared statement and is just a simple INSERT and executeUpdate. We are using the driver mysqlconnectorjava5.1.13bin. li ul

Negative 89007 pSince GLSL doesnt have an includefile option Im trying to add this by using a pragma include parser.  I want this because I have some generic methods Id like to implement only once but might use in many different shaders, like Ken Perlins smootherstepp  pParsing the shader files to get the included files works fine. But when setting the ShaderSource with the multiple source files I always run into problems since my main shader normally starts with version 330 and the versionline always has to be the first line in the shader, I can only add my main file as the first in the array of strings passed to glShadersource, and after that all the included files. But then my main file cant use any functions implemented in those included files, since theyll essentially be concatenated emafterem my main file so the compiler complains that it doesnt know the functions my main file is using.p  pThe only way I can think of to get it to work is to read the main file, parse the include pragma, and then emreplaceem that pragma line with the filecontents of the file to be included recursively applying this same method to all included files that might include other files themselves  but that would mean the linenumbers in compilationerrors would not match the real linenumbers of the main file anymore.p  pHas anybody set up some sort of include functionality for GLSL that works AND keeps the linenumbers  And if so  how p

Negative 89007 pI was just experimenting with the use of pointers when dealing with arrays and Ive become a bit confused with how C is handling the arrays. Here are the relevant bits of code I wrotep  precodedeclare a string as a pointer char szString  Randy                 cout ltlt Display string using a pointer  char pszString  szString while pszString cout ltlt pszString codepre  pFirst off, when I tried using cout to write what was in pszString without dereferencingI was a bit surprised to see it gave me the string. I just assumed it was because I gave the pointer a string and not a variable. p  pWhat really caught my attention though is that when I removed the asterisk from the line codecout ltlt pszStringcode it printed Randyandyndydyy. Im not sure why its writes the array AND then writes it again with 1 letter less. My reasoning is that after writing the char string the increment operator immediately brings the index to the next letter before it can reach the null terminator. I dont see why the null terminator wouldnt cause the loop to return false after the string is output for the first time otherwise. Is this the right reasoning Could someone explain if Im getting this relationship between arrays and pointersp

Negative 89007 pThis is a bit of an odd issue Im having. Ive been using John Resig microtemplates for a meeting minutes application, and it seemed to work well, but lately Ive been having an issue.p  pBasically the application fetches some JSON from an ajax call, and then uses the templating engine to generate a table with various actions like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5kLJN.png altactions displayp  pThis works fine, its a little slow in IE javascript rendering but it works. However randomly Ill get a stuff up in the displayp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZMQfI.png altie stuff upp  pnotice the gap there, its pushed it out wide, also, its made the rest of the rows squish up. Ive tried every CSSHTML trick I can think of to try and get IE to render it properly, but Im out of ideas any suggestions would be great . Im using JQuery Sortable so you can drag each of those rows around, I noticed that when you drag it and place it again, it displays correctly. Its as if it thinks theres an extra TD there, when there isnt. p  pSo I opened the IE developer tools and copied the inner HTML of the HTML element. Pasted this into a HTML file and put it on the server, turned off the JS so it wouldnt reload the elements and ran the page. It displays perfectly, just as in my first image. p  pSo Im confused as to why IE will render the page fine if the HTML is present from the start, but the templating engine causes odd stuff ups. p  pIll probably look at rendering that part of the HTML on the server, and only use the templating where I need to. But has anyone come across this sort of issue before is there any trick I can do to make it render it as it should p

Im building a tool that allows you create a wishlist app and wanted to add ajax to it and make it more dynamic.p  pFor example. Users can enter a shopping term, I will pull up a list of productsfrom various apis and web services and then they add in a descriptionwhy they want it and hit submit. I will add the itemcustom class like WishListItem.vb to the listWishList.vb and display the item and description on the page. They can keep doing this over and over.p  pBut getting a postback every time is annoying and not very user friendly. So I wanted to add Ajax functionality to it. And wanted to know if you guys had some good ways with jQuery and straight Javascript to do it.p  pFor example when the users type in want they want and its description and hit submit. I will add it to their list via ajax. And update the content display said the list with ajax. Like it would show a progress bar and then display the list with the newly add item.p  pI see some Ajax.BeginForm in the views, and wanted to get some guidance on the best way to implement this.p  pI was wondering how can I get my View to communicate with the Model, and vice versa which I know shouldnt happen. But how else would I add items to the list and update the html with Ajaxp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 89007 pI am creating a popup dialog using microsofts WPF.p  pThe thing is that this popup must support two or more different styles, for instance, depending on how it is called the popup must have a red background and white text in the foreground, or it must have a white background and gray text in the foreground.p  pWhat I would like to do is create as many styles as necessary in my xaml file and just choose each of them depending on how the popup was created, therefore I would like to know if it is possible to create something like this kind of a dynamically applied style inside the .xaml file, or if it is better to just do this programatically in the code behind.p  pAlso please note that I am using the Visual Studio 2010 with the .NET Framework 4.0.p  pThanks,p  pFelipep

Negative 89007 pWe have a number of machines with the Oracle JRE and JDK installed from RPM on our RHEL 5.x system e.g. java1.6.0sundevel1.6.0.261jpp.1.el5.x8664 and java1.6.0sun1.6.0.261jpp.1.el5.x8664 . I mounted the JVM directory and compared them from Beyond Compare and found a consistent pattern of differences. In, say, the keytool on one machine there is a binary sequence that shows up in several locations in the file. In that same file in the same location on another machine, there is a different binary sequence. Each machine has its own unique sequence in those locations. The unique binary sequence shows up in all the binary files that differ on a machine. p  pIs this some sort of watermark or signature Is this common in ELF binaries installed from an RPM p  pThis just seemed weird to me, but it is probably just a curiosity.

Negative 89007 pI need to create a method for my intranet web application that will authenticate a user using codeDirectoryServicescode, either against a default domain, or a user specified one. p  pOn my login form the user will be able to either give there credentials in the form of codeusernamecode and codepasswordcode or codedomainusernamecode and codepasswordcode The first case can be used when the user is in the same domain as the webserver and is quite straightfoward. The code I use isp  precode string domain     Code to check if the username is in form of domainuser or user  string username  ParseUsernameusername, out domain  ifdomain       domain  defaultDomain   PrincipalContext context  new PrincipalContextContextType.Domain, domain, username, password   bool IsAuthenticated  context.ValidateCredentialsusername, password codepre  pI pass the username and password to the PrincipalContext constructor in order to bind the call in cases where I try to access another domain. p  pFor the local domain the code works fine. However when I try to check against another domain that is being specified through the username, then I get a Server could not be contacted error. p  pI also tried using different codeContextOptionscode such as codeContextOptions.SimpleBindcode or codeContextOptions.Negotiatecodebut I always seem to be getting the same result.p  pI need to implement this, since the application is being shipped to various customers, with either single domain or multiple domain environments.  Is there something else I should specify in cases of remote domains The code needs to be flexible since this will be deployed in various environments.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I must point out, that I prefer to do it using codeDirectoryServices.AccountManagementcode and codePrincipalContextcode in order to take advantage of other functionality it provides as well.p  pAlso, I must mention that for my tests, my Dev machine is on a 10.0.0. network and the second domain I test against is on a 10.0.1.. I have a route and all, and I can succesfuly connect using an ldap client, so the question is why I cannot connect to the domain via my asp.net application.p

Negative 89007 pIf you go to a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdemostabs relnofollowthe jQuery UI tabs demoa, when you click on one or another tab, the styles change appropriately, and in particular, you dont get the annoying dotted line focus box that wrecks the look of the tab header.p  pHowever, that functionality doesnt seem to be included in the Javascript or CSS for the tabs. The annoying focus box appears on the page Im developing, and Im not the only one it also appears on a strikea hrefhttpjqueryui.googlecode.comsvntrunkdemostabsvertical.html relnofollowsample vertical tabs demoastrike that another question linked to edit Feb 413 that link is broken now.  nbsp .p  pIve looked through both the code given on the demo page emandem that pages full source code, its CSS page and the current version of the jQuery UI tabs code and cant work out how its doing that.p  pMy best guess is that its somehow done by fiddling with the size of one of the box properties of the ltligt or ltagt elements in the tab headers, but Im really not seeing it.p  pIf you know how its done, how clearly can you explain it, pleasep  pETA Prompted by a couple of questions, I just checked further and it only seems to be happening in Firefox 8.0.1 and earlier Hard to say.  no other browsers seem to show the focus box on that site does that mean its a sincefixed Firefox bug Even so, that doesnt really explain why its happening on one page and not another.p  pETA 2 I genuinely appreciate peoples suggestions on how emIem wouldshould do it, but I should clarify that thats not what Im asking. Ive read elsewhere mostly in other questions here about ways to get rid of that box, and am familiar with the ones Ive seen so far again, without being less appreciative of the effort and thought. What Im interested in is how its being done in the jQuery UI tabs demo specifically, because  as far as I can find  its not doing any of those things.p  pEdit, Feb 4, 2013 When I go to the jQuery UI tabs demo, I now see the dotted line around the element inside the tabs. I dont know whether it was a deficiency in the browser I was using when I saw the phenomenon seems likely, as not many other people seemed to see it, or what. In any case, I guess the question is moot.p  pI genuinely appreciate everyone who took the time to venture an answer. Thank youp
Negative 89007 pI have a project that uses the Google AdMob Ads SDK. Im trying to show a few ads on the homepage along with some other buttons, some of which are below the screen.p  pIve used a UIScrollView and added a few GADBannerViews from DFP inside as well the buttons. The ads load just fine and I can click on the ads and buttons with no problem.p  pThe problem is when I try to scroll the scroll view. If I start touching on the ad view, the scroll view will not scroll. If I start touching anywhere else, like a button or a blank space, the scroll view scrolls properly. It seems that the ad is somehow taking control of the touch events.p  pIve tried all sorts of fixes such as creating a transparent UIView above the ads, which didnt work because the taps would not register.p  pIve tried looping through the subviews of the GADBannerView but all the subviews classes seem proprietary to AdMob or inaccessible. GADWebView, UIWebViewScrollViewp  pI even tried adding the ad to a UITableView to see if it would scroll there, but it did not work either.p  pMy view controller class is quite large so if you need me to post some code, I can create a sample app to demonstrate the problem. A workaround for now is to create UIWebViews with the HTML ad code inside instead of using the GADBannerView. Ive tested this and it works, but I really dont want to lose the functionality of the native method.p  pIs there any way to scroll a UIScrollView if you start touching on the GADBannerView and allow the ad to remain clickable p  pThanksp

Negative 89007 pI have a vb.net project running as a toolbar extension in ArcMap.  Each one of my tools opens a modal dialog using the .ShowDialog method.  My client wants to be able to open a PDF document from the tools that will serve as the help documentation tool rather than a traditional method like HTMLHelp or Windows Help Viewer.br So, Ive imported the Interop.AcroPDFLib.dll and set up a form with an AxAcroPDF veiwer object on it.  Whenever the user clicks the help button on any of the tool dialogs, the help form opens using .Show and goes to the associated page in the document using the .setCurrentPage method.  Everything works great up to this point.p  pHowever, as you can imagine, because the tool dialog is modal, it blocks the user from being able to interact with the PDF form.  So, what I need is a technique to prevent this block so that the user will be able to scroll pages, click links within the PDF, etc. while the tool dialog is open.  I.e., I need a solution that will mimic using the traditional HTMLHelp veiwer.p  pIve tried opening the PDF form in a new thread, but that causes ArcMap to crash at Application.RunNew PDFForm.  Maybe this is because I have very little experience with multithreading, or maybe because ArcMap does not support multithreading.  Not sure.p  pAnyway, any suggestions to get me started would be greatly appreaciated.p

Negative 89007 pIve looked everywhere for this but I cant seem to figure it out.p  pIm making a application in Java that uses the Midi library. In order to run this application the user has to have a SoundBank file soundbank.gm in their JRE installation folder in libaudio. I dont want to make the user have to figure this out themselves, so I was hoping I could just package the soundbank as a resource in the application and when the application is started, I could move it to the correct directory programmatically if it wasnt there.p  pSo first I need to know how to package a resource as in the JAR. Then I need to know how to copy the resource to a different directory. I know how to copy normal files, but Im not sure how Id be able to access a file in a JAR.p  pAny help would be appreciated. Im using eclipse BTW to export a Runnable JAR.p  pEDIT I just figured out the reason my file wasnt being packaged in the JAR was because I didnt declare it as a source folder in eclipse. Now how do I access that file in Java Can I simply treat the JAR name as a folder namep

Negative 89007 pI have had a question that I actually know the answer to but wanted to put it out there for anyone else who may be struggling with it since I have not found an answer on the internet but pieced it together myself.  For the sake of saving someone else the trouble.  When your users get the same record every time they click on a different record, in Access 2003, it is most likely because when you saved in design mode it also saved the server filter property to whatever record it filtered to.  Then when you send it live it is stuck that way.  I will provide the answer to this problem below.p

Negative 89007 pIve been working on this for several hours now and have become stumped. Im probably doing something redundant or stupid thats causing this issue so any help I can get would be much appreciated.p  pIm using NSURL to pull in a website a hrefhttpundignified.podbean.comfeed relnofollowhttpundignified.podbean.comfeeda. From here Im using NSXMLParser to parse the XML page and search for the elementName enclosure. The enclosure element contains an attribute url which contains the URL for an Mp3. The parsing part works and Im able to NSLog out the contents of the array and Ive verified that all available URLs are present, but I cannot get this to load into a UITableView, it simply loads as blank. My array that Im loading the parsed out attribute values in, podAllEntries will Log to the console with the values within the dispatchasync, but when any other part of my ViewController accesses this array it is blank. I think since the async is being called on a background thread that maybe some sort of delegate has to be implemented so that other methods may access the values in this array I may be completely wrong though.p  pTo summarize Im attempting to connect to an RSS feed xml page, parse for an attribute called url and gather the value of it, and then load the URLs into a tableView.

Negative 89007 pIm looking to use Lithium framework to build my application config interface as I like its minimal approach and the documentstore i.e. Mongodb centric model.p  pHowever, and I know its not quite released yet, there is littletono information, tutorials or examples out there to move you on from the simple blog tutorial.p  pWhat I am trying to do now is build an app that will show me the collections I have in Mongodb, and then let me work with which ever collection I choose. I cant seem to figure outp  pa how would I build a model that enumerates the collections  preferably according to my internal naming scheme, p  pb how do I break the convention model so I can specify the name of the collection to usep  pI think there are two things im struggling with to answer these two questions  perhaps a fundamental misunderstanding of how to move a model in MVC beyond the simple collectionmodelcontrollerview examples, and secondly, the actual process of telling the mongo datasource what collection to use.p  pany pointers or examples, gratefully received.p  pChrisp  pstrongupdatestrongp  pSo I figured out how to set the collection  for reference you can set source in the meta array like thisp  precodeprotected meta  array     source gt ltltcollectionNamegtgt  codepre  pstill no idea how to use a Model that will list me all the collections I have in my DB though.

Negative 89007 pSo heres a problem and questionp  pIm analyzing a document page on HTML5 Canvas and detecting certain features, such as boxes, labels, text blocks, images, tables, etc. Because Canvas is slow for pixel readwrite and the image needs to be highres for good accuracy e.g. 1500 x 2500, I cannot afford to analyze every pixel, let alone in multiple passes.p  pMy algorithm does some random pixel pokes and does some minimal analysis to find if there is a usable bounding box for further processing and the type of processing that needs to be done some parts may be sent to the server, like OCR.p  pEvery subsequent random poke checks against a growing list of successfully found bounding boxes and pokes elsewhere until it gets into uncharted waters. The technique is surprisingly simple and effective, but this results in a lot of extra random pokes and does not provide consistent results without large poke counts 1 of area, and even then it misses some parts intermittently.p  pWhat would be great is to implement some spatial analysis algorithm that can tell me where the unpoked areas are outside of all bounding boxes, so that I can restrict my xy random coordinate selection to there only. It should increase the efficacy and speed by a significant amount.p  pMy typical box count for a fully analyzed doc page is lt 200.p  pDoes any algorithm exist in the public domainwiki that can do this in JavaScript reasonably fastp

Negative 89007 pSo I have been looking for a way to do this for a while and every time I find something, it leads to a different problem.p  pBasically, I have a game console. The console runs snippets of C code. The compiled assembly needs to be a friend of the current assembly so that the console would know about all the types in the current assembly and could manipulate them.p  pProblem one Every time you run a console command, a new assembly is generated I would love to avoid this if anyone knows how and for it to be a friend assembly it needs to have the same name as the last one. Unfortunately you cant unload the previous assembly so the new one cant overwrite it. This forces me to use AppDomains.p  pProblem two If I make each assembly use a separate AppDomain and then unload the last one, it works but I cant manipulate the objects from the current AppDomain because they dont derive from MarshalByRef so when I pass them as parameters to the script it tries to serialize them. I dont like AppDomains.p  pSo I figured the most painless way would be to just generate assemblies in the same AppDomain with different names and somehow set them as friend assemblies at runtime.p  pI do realize that this might not be possible so any other alternatives a welcome.p  pEDIT To make it more clear. Script needs to access the mainparent assemblies internals. Not the other way around. I cant make everything public in the main assembly because I want the code to be reusable.p

A property group has several properties, a property has several buildings. p  pI want to set up administration on each level.p  pa codePropGroupAdmincode can view and edit all the properties inside the set property group, and the buildings inside.p  pa codePropAdmincode can only view the set property and the buildings withinp  pand a codeBldngAdmincode can only view the set buildingp  pHow I envision it working is that user Bobby is a PropGroupAdmin with a propertygroup id of 102. That would translate into a series of specific privileges that I could read from a view.p  pThe question I have is how can I set up the GroupPrivileges table to be able to inherit if thats the right word the hierarchy Essentially allowing me to create a view that I could just read to see if a user has the right permissions to perform a task.p  pI created a little chart of how I imagine it will work. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNaxPO.png altenter image description herep  pI know This wont work this way, Im just trying to figure out hot to make changes to get a similar result.p

Negative 89007 pI am new with iOS and https stuffs. I am a beginning software student. I want to write an app that extract the data such as class number, announcements, etc from my uni account and show me on my app.p  pNormally, I go to my uni student page, login with my username and password, and those information showed up on the browser.p  pIve tried using NSURLConnection and its delegate. please look at my code below. In the beginning, in the method connectiondidReceviveAuthenticationChallenge, I created an NSURLCredential object by [NSURLCredential withUserpasswordpersistence]. And it was not working. Then I tried to do NSLog, then i just found out that the protectionSpace.authenticationMethod is NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust.p  pThen, I tried to read Apples document and some googled sources. But, I cant really get it, and then I edited my code as you seen below it is my final edition, and its still not working.p  pThe point that i dont really get is I expect that the server should ask me for my username and password. Instead of that, it asked for credentialForTrust, which based on those documents Ive read, they suggest me to evaluate the trust of NSURLConnection delegate against the server. However, the server never asked for username and password. so, how can the server know which account I am accessing.p  pSo, i think it should be some relationship between that certificatetrust with username and password. I dont really understand how these things work.p  pI think, my question might not be really clear or something, and it might be foolish. I accept this because Ive never learned all these things.p  pSo, please someones explain me of how these things work. You can assume that I have some basic understanding of what is https, SSL, NSURLConnection, NSURLCredential, etc. and please guide me to the solution.p  pI am appreciate for all your efforts. p  pBelow is my code, its not working.p  pThe NSLog in connectiondidReceiveAuthenticationChallenge, print out NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrustp  precode BOOLconnectionNSURLConnection connection canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpaceNSURLProtectionSpace protectionSpace      return YES    voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection didReceiveAuthenticationChallengeNSURLAuthenticationChallenge challenge      NSLogauthenticationMethod is  n,challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod     if [challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod isEqualToStringNSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust]           [challenge.sender useCredential[NSURLCredential credentialForTrustchallenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust] forAuthenticationChallengechallenge]     else             NSURLCredential creden  [[NSURLCredential alloc] initWithUsermyusername passwordmypassword persistenceNSURLCredentialPersistenceForSession]             [[challenge sender] useCredentialcreden forAuthenticationChallengechallenge]         voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection didFailWithErrorNSError error      NSLogdidFailWithError  n  n,           [error localizedDescription],           [[error userInfo] objectForKeyNSURLErrorFailingURLStringErrorKey]    voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection didReceiveDataNSData data       [self.myData appendDatadata]    voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection didReceiveResponseNSURLResponse response      [self.myData setLength0]    voidconnectionDidFinishLoadingNSURLConnection connection       NSString str  [[NSString alloc] initWithDataself.myData    encodingNSASCIIStringEncoding]     NSLogData in String , str  codepre
Negative 89007 pI have imported a huge hierarchy of maven projects into IntelliJ idea, now idea has created .iml projects on all different levels. I would like to svnignore these files.p  pThere are several similar questions, for example this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq6878673342852svn subversion ignore specific file types in all subdirectories, configured on rootap  pHowever the answer is always to apply codesvnignorecode with the coderecursivecode flag. Thats not what I am looking for, I just want to ignore the files I created, not set a property on the hundreds of directories underneath.p  pBasically, what I have is the output of p  precodesvn status  grep .iml codepre  pwhich looks like thisp  precode       foobarbar.iml        foobazphleem.iml        flappflapp.iml codepre  petc.p  pWhat I would like to do is for each entry codedirproject.imlcode to add codesvnignore .imlcode to codedircode. I am guessing I have to pipe the above grep to codesedcode or codeawkcode and from there to codesvncode, but I am at a total loss as to the exact sed or awk command on one hand and the exact svn command with which I wont override existing svnignore values on the other hand.p  pUpdate what I am also not looking for are solutions based on codefindcode, because possibly there are projects in this hierarchy where .iml files are in fact committed and I wouldnt want to interfere with those projects, so Im looking to add the property only for .iml files my IDE has created.p
Negative 89007 pThe server 192.168.1.53001, is running Linux 3.2, and is designed to only accept one connection at a time. The client 192.168.1.18, is running Windows 7. The connection is a wireless connection. Both programs are written in C.p  pIt works great 9 in 10 connectdisconnect cycles. The tenthish randomly happens connection has the server accept the connection, then when it later actually writes to it typically 30s later, according to Wireshark see screenshot it looks like its writing to an old stale connection, with a port number that the client has FINed a while ago, but the server hasnt yet FINed. So the client and server connections seems to get out of sync  the client makes new connections, and the server tries writing to the previous one. Every subsequent connection attempt fails once it gets in this broken state. The broken state can be initiated by going beyond the maximum wireless range for a half a minute as before 9 in 10 cases this works, but it sometimes causes the broken state.p  pa hrefhttpbayimg.comKaPjaaaDH relnofollowWireshark screenshot behind linkap  pThe red arrows in the screenshot indicate when the server started sending data Len  0, which is the point when the client rejects it and sends a RST to the server. The coloured dots down the right edge indicate a single colour for each of the client port numbers used. Note how one or two dots appear well after the rest of the dots of that colour were and note the time column.p  pThe problem looks like its on the servers end, since if you kill the server process and restart, it resolves itself until next time it occurs.p  pThe code is hopefully not too outoftheordinary. I set the queue size parameter in listen to 0, which I think means it only allows one current connection and no pending connections I tried 1 instead, but the problem was still there. None of the errors appear as trace prints where  error is shown in the code.p  precode Server code  mySocket  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0 if mySocket  1     error    Set nonblocking const int saveFlags  fcntlmySocket, FGETFL, 0 fcntlmySocket, FSETFL, saveFlags  ONONBLOCK   Bind to port   Union to work around pointer aliasing issues. union SocketAddress    sockaddr myBase   sockaddrin myIn4   SocketAddress address memsetreinterpretcastltTbytegtampaddress, 0, sizeofaddress address.myIn4.sinfamily  AFINET address.myIn4.sinport  htonsPort address.myIn4.sinaddr.saddr  INADDRANY if bindmySocket, ampaddress.myBase, sizeofaddress  0     error  if listenmySocket, 0  0     error     main loop    ...

Negative 89007 pIs there any way to pass one mixin or styles declaration to another mixin as an input parameterp  pLets take a look at an example with animation keyframes. Following is how we define keyframes in pure CSSp  precodemozkeyframes somename      from  color red      to  color blue    webkitkeyframes somename      from  color red      to  color blue    keyframes somename      from  color red      to  color blue   codepre  pIdea is to simplify these declarations using mixins, so we can have something like followingp  precode.keyframesname, from, to       here we need somehow to reproduce structure      that we have in an example above    define one animation .myfrom  color red  .myto  color blue   the following wont work because you cannot pass mixin as a parameter  in way I have here, so I am looking for a way to solve this problem .keyframessomename, .myfrom, .myto   define another animation .anotherfrom  fontsize 1em  .anotherto  fontsize 2em  .keyframesanothername, .anotherfrom, .anotherto codepre  pThe system will have different modules that could be dynamically attached to application as well as removed. So, dont suggest me to use codeimportcode because its not the case. Output CSS is dynamically compiled onfly using information about modules and their own LESS styles as well as base LESS dependencies like mixins library and etc.p  pNote it will work for me if you know a way to pass class definition instead of mixin. In an example above it would be code.myfromcode instead of code.myfromcode and etc.p

Negative 89007 pI have a servlet and JSP which share JavaBean instances  the servlet initialises them since the beans require constructor params and stores them in the session, then forwards to a JSP which gets user input and submits back to the servlet via a form POST request. In the servlets codedoPostcode method it retrieves the JavaBeans again, but all of its values that would have been set by the form are null. If I use the GET method on the form instead then the values are populated, and whilst debugging I can see that the JavaBean property values are in fact set. So why does my codedoPostcode method retrieve beans from the session with null values Interestingly, the fields that are passed in through constructor parameters of each object are in fact set correctly whether its GET or POST  its just those properties managed through the form that arent set.p  pstrongAbbreviated code samplesstrongp  pemServletemp  precodeprotected void doGetHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException      HttpSession session  request.getSession     Customer customer  Customersession.getAttributecustomer     if customer  null              customer  new Customer.....         session.setAttributecustomer, customer          Address address  Addresssession.getAttributeaddress     if address  null              address  new Address.....         session.setAttributeaddress, address          forwardcheckout.jsp, request, response  ... protected void doPostHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException      PrintWriter out  response.getWriter     Customer customer  Customerrequest.getSession.getAttributecustomer     if customer  null              out.printlnCustomer   customer.toString          Address address  Addressrequest.getSession.getAttributeaddress     if address  null              out.printlnAddress   address.toString       codepre  pemJSPemp  precodeltjspuseBean idcustomer classcom.mycompany.myproject.Customer scopesession gt ltjspsetProperty namecustomer propertygt ltjspuseBean idaddress classcom.mycompany.myproject.Address scopesession gt ltjspsetProperty nameaddress propertygt  ...  ltform methodPOST actionpageContext.request.contextPath checkoutgt     lttablegt         lttrgt             lttdgtTitlelttdgt             lttdgtltinput typetext nametitle value customer.title  gtlttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgtGiven namelttdgt             lttdgtltinput typetext namegivenName value customer.givenName  gtlttdgt         lttrgt         ...     lttablegt     ltinput typesubmit valuePlace order gt ltformgt codepre  pWhen I enter data into this form and click Place Order the output of the toString calls show all the fields of codecustomercode and codeaddresscode as null.p

Negative 89007 pI have a very basic knowledge of using OpenGL, especially on Android. Im developing an app that uses OpenGL in order to switch between full screen images in a fast way since its too slow using the normal Android framework.p  pWhat Ive found is that in order to load textures, I need to do something likep  precodeByteBuffer byteBuffer  ByteBuffer.allocateDirectvertices.length  4 byteBuffer.orderByteOrder.nativeOrder vertexBuffer  byteBuffer.asFloatBuffer vertexBuffer.putvertices vertexBuffer.position0 byteBuffer  ByteBuffer.allocateDirecttexture.length  4 byteBuffer.orderByteOrder.nativeOrder textureBuffer  byteBuffer.asFloatBuffer textureBuffer.puttexture textureBuffer.position0 gl  gl final Bitmap bitmap  BitmapFactory.decodeResourcecontext.getResources, imageResourceId gl.glGenTextures1, textures, 0 gl.glBindTextureGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, textures[0] gl.glTexParameterfGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, GL10.GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GL10.GLNEAREST gl.glTexParameterfGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, GL10.GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GL10.GLLINEAR GLUtils.texImage2DGL10.GLTEXTURE2D, 0, bitmap, 0 bitmap.recycle codepre  pNow, since the images are meant to be full screen and they are quite large  1024x1024, this takes some time, especially since I need to load 5 of them at the same time.p  pSo I need to ask some questions regarding tips of improving the code, especially about efficient loading but also using less memory if possiblep  ol lipif I decode the bitmap to not have transparency pixels, by using the RGB565 format, will it boost the speed of loading the images to OpenGL or the decoding phasepli lipdoes the input bitmap have to have a width and height that are powers of 2 or can I let OpenGL take only the part that it wants, which will have this rule I mean, maybe I can make the codetexImage2Dcode command to take only a part of the bitmappli lipmaybe I can even decode only this part from the beginning so if I have a huge image of 10000x10000, I can decode only a 1024x1024 part of it and give it to OpenGLpli lipis it possible to load and show just the first image, and in the background load the rest Ive heard that you cant send the bitmaps to OpenGL in a thread that is not the one that handles it. Does it make sense to load them on the codeonDrawFramecode method of the codeGlRenderercode, say, the second time it get calledpli lipI remember Ive heard of a tip about merging multiple images into a single image one after another, from left to right, so that it might have some speed boost for the decoding phase. Not sure what is the name of this technique. Is it still possible for OpenGL ES on Android pli lipis it possible to avoid creating a Bitmap instance and let the decoding done in a more native way NDK , perhaps According to my tests, decoding a PNG file of size 1024x1024 on an emulator takes about 400ms700ms, yet sending it to OpenGL takes about 50ms70ms.pli lipusing Procrank, Ive found out that OpenGL can take a lot of memory. Is it possible to make it use less memory Maybe use better textures typespli lipsince Android can work on many kinds of devices, is it possible to put in the manifest a requirement of how much memory is needed for the app to run, so that people with too little memory wont be able to install itpli ol  hr  pMajid Max p  ol lipso its enough to decode this way and send it to OpenGL, or should I also set something special when sending to openGLpli lipthere is no such a command to take a partial part of the bitmappli lipI meant, can I decode only a partial part of the file to be stored in a bitmap, instead of all of the bitmappli lipso the only thing I can do I to load everything in the beginning, and then use it all How could it be How do games handle it I mean, they do show one stage after another, even with something that looks like an OpenGL generated progress bar. This is very problematic.pli lipwhat Im describing is available on the web too. For example, instead of loading multiple tiny images, the webpage contain a single image and maps what part of it should be shown where. Another name for it is a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSprite28computergraphics29 relnofollowspritesa. Example a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFile3aSpriteexample.gif relnofollowherea .pli lipI see. I guess I should also call glDeleteTextures when I see there arent used anymore, rightpli liphow do I do that What should I change in the codepli lipwhat happens when I use a lot of memory Is there such a thing as virtual RAM uses internal storage perhaps when there is no free RAM Ive heard about it on Google IO video, but it seems like they werent sure about the answer as well. Link a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvCruQY55HOkampfeatureplayerembeddedt3269s relnofollowherea. They only said to expect more crashes when such a thing occurs.pli ol  hr  pMajid Max p  p123. p  ol lipthis might work. You mean that I make a new thread that will load the bitmaps, and then send the results back to the OpenGL thread which will bind the textures to the bitmap Maybe I could use a similar approach to asyncTask, and use publishprogress.pli lipthats also a good thing. Do you have any link I should read about it Or maybe a snippet to change in my codepli lipthanks.pli lipso i think its the easiest thing to use ETC1. However it doesnt support transparency at all, so according to a hrefhttpinfocenter.arm.comhelpindex.jsptopiccom.arm.doc.dui0555aCHDIEGGI.html relnofollowthis linka, I need to use another texture just for that, but I cant find a sample for this.pli lipwhat can I assume about the available memory that I can use Can I assume, for example, that all Android devices can offer me 200MB of video memory that I can use for OpenGLpli ol

Negative 89007 pI have a stored procedure, and I want to ensure it cannot be executed concurrently.p  pMy multithreaded application does all necessary work on the underlying table via this stored procedure.p  pimo, locking the table itself is an unnecessarily drastic action to take, and so when I found out about codespGetAppLockcode, which essentially enforces a critical section, this sounded ideal.p  pMy plan was to encase the stored procedure in a transaction and to set up codespGetAppLockcode with transaction scope. The code was written and tested successfully.p  pThe code has now been put forward for review and I have been told that I should not call this function. However when asking the obvious question why not, the only reasons I am getting are highly subjective, to do with any form of locking being complicated.p  pI dont necessarily buy this, but I was wondering whether anyone had any emobjectiveem reasons why I should avoid this constuct. Like I say, given my circumstances a critical section sounds an ideal approach to me.p  pTIA, Petep  pstrongfurther infostrong An application sits on top of this with 2 threads T1 and T2. Each thread is waiting for a different message M1 and M2. The business logic involved says that processing can only happen once both M1 and M2 have arrived. The stored procedure logs that Mx has arrived insert and then checks whether My is present select. The builtin locking is fine to make sure the inserts happen serially. But the selects need to happen serially too and I think I need to do something over and above the builtin functionality here.p  pjust for clarity, I want the processing to happen exactly once. So I cant afford for the stored procedure to return either false positives or false negatives. Im worried that if the stored proc runs twice in very quick succession, then both selects might return data which indicates that it is appropriate to perform processing.p

Flexgridlayerstable has fields for JDAY and Segment, and metdata has fields JDAY, TAIR, and TDEW in this simple example, but actually more fields.

Should the admin just press a reset button over the row and tell the user to check his email when he arrives home and proceed with the recovery reset link for example Or should the administrator reset the users password and give him his new password in that very moment The second approach is preferable as I was asked to do that...p  pI know that the admin shouldnt be able to see the original password as it should be hashed and unknown.p  pWhat are your thoughts about this How would you implement this functionality Thanks for your help.p

Negative 89007 pI have a series of pages that are each displaying a collection of videos. A sort of video playlist, if you will. To make it easy to address each of the videos, I run the mediaelement.js plugin on them and store the mediaElement object in an array like thisp  precodevar mediaArray  [] .class.eachfunction index      this.mediaelementplayer         success function mediaElement, domObject              mediaArray[index]  mediaElement                codepre  pThis works great for allowing me to have controls outside of the mediaelement.js player address the various mediaElement objects. So I can, for example, have users click on the title of the next video to switch to playing that one.p  pWhere I run into trouble is when I try to allow the user to change the volume on one of the videos and then maintain that volume when they start playing the next video.p  pI can easily write a function like thisp  precode    setAllVolume  function value          for var i0, ilmediaArray.length iltil i              mediaArray[i].setVolumevalue               codepre  pAnd that works great if I have a volume control outside of the mediaelement.js controls. E.g., if I build a jQueryUI slider for a universal volume control.p  pWhat Ive tried is to add an event listener for the changevolume event and have that fire my codesetAllVolumecode function like thisp  precode.class.eachfunction index      this.mediaelementplayer         success function mediaElement, domObject              mediaArray[index]  mediaElement             mediaElement.addEventListenervolumechange, function                   setAllVolumemediaElement.volume               codepre  pAs you might imagine, setting the volume in this fashion causes each mediaElement to fire its own volumechange event and to recursively call the codesetAllVolumecode function in a cascading fail pile that causes ones browser to hang up as it churns through the process again and again.p  pSo, is there a way I can have a change in the volume of one video reflected in the other videos without running into this recursion I should mention that Im using H.264 video and this problem appears to only occur in browsers using the Flash plugin to play that format.p

If the server tells yes you can click that the client displays this as a X. p  pNow my problem How exactly do I tell the server that I want to click that field. I came across another question here and they ended up in using the commandpattern. But if I understood it right, I would have to create a Command that implements an Interface. I serialize an instance of that command and send it to the server. The server executes the command. But I have to main problems with that p  ol liIf the command sets a cell of the tictacto to an X. How do I tell the Server that he has to pass the GameBoard which I need to set the cell to an X to my InvokeMethod of the interface ICommand.li liIsnt that extremely unsecure I mean I could write a command that deletes all my files or stops the server and send it to the server. I dont believe that the CommandPattern is that nice idea.li ol  pSo I am searching for something better. I just want to have an easy and extensible architecture for my client and the server.

Negative 89007 pIn codeR 2.15.0code and codedata.table 1.8.9codep  precoded  data.tablea  15, value  26, key  a  d[J3, value]    a value    3     4  d[J3][, value]    4 codepre  pI expected both to produce the same output the 2nd one and I believe they emshouldem.p  pIn the interest of clearing up that this is not a codeJcode syntax issue, same expectation applies to the following identical to the above expressionsp  precodet  data.tablea  3, key  a d[t, value] d[t][, value] codepre  pI would expect both of the above to return the exact same output.p  pstrongSo let me rephrase the questionstrong  why is codedata.tablecode designed so that the emkeyem column printed out automatically in coded[t, value]codep  pstrongUpdate based on answers and comments belowstrong Thanks Arun et al., I understand the designwhy now. The reason the above prints the emkeyem is because there is a hidden embyem present every time you do a codedata.tablecode merge via the codeX[Y]code syntax, and that codebycode is by the key. The reason its designed this way seems to be the following  since the codebycode operation has to be performed when merging, one might as well take advantage of that and not do another codebycode if you are going to do that by the key of the merge.p  pNow that said, I believe thats a syntax design flaw. The way I read codedata.tablecode syntax coded[i, j, by  b]code is p  blockquote   ptake codedcode, apply the codeicode operation be that subsetting or merging or whatnot, and then do the codejcode expression by bp blockquote  pThe bywithoutby breaks this reading and introduces cases one has to think about specifically am I merging on codeicode, is codebycode just the key of the merge, etc. I believe this should be the job of the codedata.tablecode  the commendable effort to make codedata.tablecode faster in one particular case of the merge, when the codebycode is equal to the key, should be done in an alternative way e.g. by checking internally if the codebycode expression is actually the key of the merge.p

Negative 89007 pI have an exam in a couple of hours and I am trying to solve sample questions for it. I couldnt find a solution to following question. p  blockquote   blockquote     pDraw a class diagram corresponding to the following situationp          pA grocery store e.g., a supermarket sells items. There are two types of items edible     i.e., any item that can be used as food and nonedible. Some items are sold by weight,     and some are sold per unit. Some items are taxable, while others are not. Some items     have special prices when sold in groups e.g., 2 for 3. A purchase may contain many     items.p          pIn your class diagram, show only the classesabstract classesinterfaces, associations,     and multiplicities for the associations. Do not include any operations Clearly indicate     interfaces and abstract classes if any in your design.p          pFurthermore, your design should be as      strongflexiblestrong as possible. In particular, you need to     pay attention to the following pointsp          p1 An item is either edible or not and this fact does not change during the lifetime of     the item, whereas the pricing strategies may change during the lifetime of the item.p          p2 Each pricing strategy is associated with a certain set of operations. For example,     for the taxing strategy, whether or not an item is taxable, we may have an operation     that computes the tax this function can then return 0 for nontaxable itemsp          p3 Although the set of operations for a pricing strategy stays the same, the ways those     operations are handled may change over time. For example, the way we compute     taxes for edible and nonedible items may differ over time.p          p4 Although the set of operations for a pricing strategy stays the same across different     items, we may want to implement those operations in different ways for different     items. For example, we may want to compute the tax differently for oranges and     apples.p   blockquote blockquote  pI tried something like this thinking that it could suit to the Strategy Design Pattern, but I am not sure at all. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRJBKQ.png altenter image description herep

Can anyone help me out of this mess p  pTo make matters worse, all of this only happens on the server under Linux. None of these raises an exception in my development environment on Windows. Bonus points for an explanation as to why that is, just because Im curious. I suspect it has to do with a different default encoding. However, they all are not accepted by the server. What does work on Windows is if I drop the codesaxutils.escapecode and then hand a proper unicode object to suds. This however still results in the same codeUnicodeDecodeErrorcode on Linux.p  pemUpdateem I started debugging this on Windows where it works fine, and in the line 827 of httplib.py, it indeed tries to concatenate the unicode object codemsgcode containing the HTTP headers and the str object codemessagebodycode, leading to the implicit unicode decoding with the incorrect encoding. I guess it just happens to not fail on Windows for some reason. I dont understand why suds tries to send a str object when I put a unicode object in at the top.p

Negative 89007 h3Problemh3  pWhen I inject an EJB proxy in the codeMaincode class of an application client, and that EJB has a method that require a user to be in a certain role, then the application client container ACC will require the user to login as soon as the application client launches. The ACC will not differentiate between what methods the client had in mind calling, thus what roles  if any at all  are actually required of the client to be in. In effect, that means my client cannot hook himself up with the server properly if just one single method of the EJB has a method that require a certain role. It does not matter if we explicitly annotate the EJB with codePermitAllcode. The ACC will still prompt for username and password, and if not given, then my GlassFish 3.1.2.2 build 5 implementation will abort everything and say emThe user cancelled authenticationem.p  h3Setup your test environmenth3  pDeclare a remote interface like sop  precodeRemote public interface IRemoteEJB  String echoGuestString returnMe String echoAdminString returnMe  codepre  pWrite the EJB my problem relates to a singleton so I dare not use another session annotation herep  precodeSingleton    See the following annotation. We explicitly permit all on class level.   Should not cause any ambiguity at all   PermitAll public class myEJB implements IRemoteEJB      Override     public String echoGuestString returnMe          return returnMe       Override      ..but here we grant access only to administrators     RolesAllowedadmin     public String echoAdminString returnMe          return returnMe   codepre  pAs for the client part, heres the smallest possible implementation I could think ofp  precodepublic class Main      EJB private static remoteProxy      public static void mainString... args              String reply  remoteProxy.echoGuestHello world         JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, reply       codepre  h3Resulth3  pDo you think that the client successfully makes an anonymous call to the codeechoGuestcode method No. Ive found that the ACC will force the client to give username and password even before the codeEJBcode is injected. Simply put if, we cannot mix access authentication to an EJB from an application client. The solution above would be to remove the codeRolesAllowedadmincode annotation from the codeechoAdmincode method.p  pIn one way, that makes perfectly sense. The ACC is only active during the boot of the client, the very reason why we need to put all injected resources in an application client both in the codeMaincode class and make them codestaticcode too. The ACC simply cannot know exactly which methods in the EJB will be invoked or not.p  pOkay, but does that not break the specification and expected behavior of the codePermitAllcode and codeRolesAllowedcode annotations Is there no way on this earth that we could provide the application client with anonymous access rights to an EJB that has only one obsolete, never invoked, method requiring a certain role As of now, I have to separate these methods not only with the annotations I thought I could and should have done, but also I have to refactor the logic to completely separate EJBs. Feels hard p

Negative 89007 pIm using Selenium WebDriver to get some content from a site that dynamically loads it using Ajax. I created a custom Wait class to check for a condition on the page to make sure that the page has loaded before continuing. I used FluentWait to set the polling interval to 2 and timeout to 10. However, I noticed that it checks for the first time at time increment 0, then waits 2 seconds if the condition was false, then checks again, etc. p  pSince the page takes emsomeem time to load, it always is false at the first check, but usually is true at the second. Is there any way to make Wait wait the 2 seconds embeforeem checking for the first time I.e. check at times 2,4,and 6, if necessary, rather than at 0,2,4,and 6p  pThanks,  bsgp  pstrongEDITstrong Ive been asked to mention emwhyem I want this behavior  after all, Im using the Wait the way its meant to be used. The benefit I get from it returning true the first time is the following WebDriver apparently opens a new socket every time it issues a command to the browser. For whatever reason, these sockets dont always get closed after the call executes. When executing a large number of calls in a short time for instance, when  repeatedly checking for a condition, which is what Wait does, it is possible to run out of virtual sockets, and the driver crashes. The lack of enough virtual sockets seems to be a known issue on Windows 7, but I cant modify my system.p  pThe fewer calls to the driver I issue in a short period of time, the less likely it is to overrun the number of available sockets. I have observed that the first check emneverem returns true, and therefore its just opening a socket for no reason, making the program more likely to crash. Thats why I want to wait. I hope this explanation is helpful for someone searching for information as to why they keep getting SocketExceptions in WebDriver. p

Negative 89007 pIm having troubles trying to compile an Android application with Gradle 0.5. and Android Studio, using SimpleXML.p  pThis is the errorp  precodeGradle Execution failed for task MyApplicationdexDebug. gt Failed to run command     ApplicationsAndroid Studio.appsdkbuildtoolsandroid4.2.2dx dex output ltREALLYLONGSTRING.....gt   Error Code     1   Output     trouble processing javaxxmlstreameventsStartElement.class     Illadvised or mistaken usage of a core class java. or javax.     when not building a core library.     This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file     in your applications project, when using an IDE such as     Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a     core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats     going on.     However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core     namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,     from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most     assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the     compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.     It is also often of questionable legality.     If you really intend to build a core library  which is only     appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine     distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use     the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.     If you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact     building an application, then be forewarned that your application     will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be     prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your     application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating     system. You will be to blame for this problem.     If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a     core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to     repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into     your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in     conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help     you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then     that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately     lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.     1 error aborting codepre  pbuild.gradle is configured like thatp  precodedependencies      [...]     compile org.simpleframeworksimplexml2.7.  repositories      [...]     mavenCentral  codepre  pHow can i solve this problemp  pstrongEDITstrong The problem is not present if i install SimpleXML directly as a Jar inside libs  of course a maven solution would be cleaner.p

Negative 89007 pI have a couple of Mercurial installations running on IIS7 on a 2008 server. Id like to use the monoblue theme style for both of them, but I want to change the colour of the second one. p  pTo accomplish this, I copied the monoblue theme, and its related static files and renamed it to monored. I adjusted the header.tmpl file to point at the new stylemonored.css file in the static folder and updated the sites hgweb.config to reference my new theme, monored. Ive done this in both the files in the site itself in the template folder and also in the Mercurial installation folder, CProgram Files x86Mercurial.p  pHowever, when I update the hgweb.config file, all that happens is that the theme reverts to paper the default. Im obviously missing something, but I cant find any information on the web that points to what Im missing out. Effectively, bar the change to the header.tmpl to reference the stylemonored.css file in the static directory, the only other change Ive made is to change the monoblue colour in the css file to a red variation i.e. 006699 became 996600.p  pAnyone out there got any ideas on what Im missing out on changing. Ive also investigated my Python installation to see if there were any Mercurial references in it, but I couldnt find any. p  pFYI My Python installation is from the Windows x86 specific Python2.7.5.msi My Mercurial installation is from the Windows x86 specific Mercurial 2.6.2 MSI installer.p  pIn my travels about the Googlesphere, Ive discovered the following two websites that have instructions on how to adjustedit Mercurial templates. Ive followed these, but to no avail.p  pa hrefhttpwww.endswithsaurus.com201005settingupandconfiguringmercurialin3404.html relnofollowhttpwww.endswithsaurus.com201005settingupandconfiguringmercurialin3404.htmla a hrefhttpcolas.nahaboo.netHacksHgwebMercurialTemplateCustomization relnofollowhttpcolas.nahaboo.netHacksHgwebMercurialTemplateCustomizationap  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p  pUPDATE I found the answer to my question.

Negative 89007 pI am using the terminal application on osX to connect to ubuntu 12.04 i think. I have the terminal at its default setting of xerm256. In this mode the terminal sends the sequence of 033OQ when F2 is pressed. There is no mapping however for ShiftF2 or ControlF2. There is also no sequences set for ShiftLeft, ShiftRight, ControlLeft, ControlRight, etc. I need some of these keys to operate features from time to time in various programs. Take for example byobu. ShiftF2 and ControlF2 are used to split the screen vertically and horizontally. In tmux the arrow keys are used with shift and control for resizing panes.p  pMy problem is that I dont know what sequence the terminal should send. How do I find out what these sequences should be I know that I can press Controlv and then a key to get the code that is being received but this is not what I need. I dont need to see what sequence is being sent. I need to know what sequence I need to send.p  pFor instance my left arrow sends [OD. My ControlLeft sends [[5D]. However my up and down keys have no distinction. My down sends [OB and Controldown also sends [OB. Same problem with my up key.

Negative 89007 pIm reviewing a requirements spec where some of the requirements include the word and or sometimes even a list of required functionality.p  pAm mostly thinking these should be broken up but this does have the downside of making a long document even longer and even less readable  which in practice may mean its intended audience ends up skimming over it or only reading sections rather than absorbing the whole thing.p  pHowever, there are some requirements where it seems a bit silly to break them up. E.g there are a lot of getset operations, which always go together  it seems a bit overkill to always break them up into The user shall be able to get..., The user shall be able to set... Other examples are enabledisable, validation lists, supported platformsbrowsers etc.p  pJust wondering if anyone has had similar thoughts and whether it might sometimes be OK to break the rule of atomicityp

Negative 89007 pIm writing crossplatform app for iOS, Android amp Windows Phone 8. p  pI have a massive common class library that compiled 100 for both iOS and Android using the Xamarin tooling and their silverlight subset of the .NET core libraries.p  pIronically, when compiling that same standard code for Windows Phone 8 an amazing number of useful .NET core APIs are gone, missing or moved. p  pThis poses a serious issue for my crossplatform code since now the data and processing tiers are not crossplatform at all.p  pI used a Microsoft.Bcl.Compression PCL to solve some of the missing APIs but theres still a whole bunch others missing. p  pQuestion is, how do Xamarin users suggest overcoming these limitations to achieve crossplatform as advertized It doesnt seem possible at all to share a common code base between iosandroid and WP8. Perhaps between iOS and Android only but throw in WP8 and not even ASCII strings are supported Shock Horrorp  pIs there a silverlight subset PCL for WP8 or are we just not supposed to support WP8 at all p

Negative 89007 pI have a STM32F2 controller and a FRAM device FM24V10G connected to it via I2C. Usually, in order to communicate with I2C devices I use a library, based on libopencm3. However, using FRAM requires a slightly different order of I2C actionslike sending start, 7 bit address, etc, meaning I cant use standard library functions like read and write, which helped me with other I2C devices. In this library I2C is implemented as a class, and it has stream operators overloaded in order to send those I2C commands in a desired order.p  pFor examplep  precodeI2camp I2coperatorltlt operationt operation      switch operation          case Start             i2csendstartreg             while checkEventSR2I2CSR2BUSY  I2CSR2MSL  I2CSR1SB             break         case Stop             i2csendstopreg             break         case WaitEnd             while checkEventI2CSR1TxE             break     return this  codepre  pSometimes, some of these commands fail to be executed, resulting in the CPU waiting for some flaglike in case of WaitEnd, stopping the whole system from functioning. p  pSo heres my question Is there a way to return some kind of a timeout flag in the code above For me, its crucial to have the system functioning at all times, just skipping one command if the I2C operation fails and reaches timeout is OK.p  pThanks to everyone who is reading thisp

Negative 89007 pIn Eclipse codeFile Searchcode you have the possibility to search for containing text and filter the result with Filename patterns. For example if you search for codesetValueint xcode with filename pattern My.java you will find the codesetValueint xcode method in a File named codeMyGame.javacode, but not in a file named codeYourGame.javacode. Now i need a way to filter the search to only show results in a specific method. For example if i have 10 classes which override a codeinitcode method and a coderesetcode method of the same superclass. Inside the codeinitcode and the coderesetcode the codesetValueint xcode gets called. Now i want to search for all occurences of codesetValueint xcode, but only inside the codeinitcode methods. Is there a way to do this With regular expression maybe or does Eclipse have such a method Thanksp

Negative 89007 pI have been having problems with a pivot table that uses an external .csv file as its source, particularly with dates in the csv file being treated as text. So, I decided to import the csv file into another worksheet and then force the dates to be recognised as such by reformatting the relevant columns. p  pThe problem I now have is changing the existing pivot table to use the data in the new worksheet instead of an external source. If I click on Change Data Source button, the Select a table or range option is greyed out. If I continue with external data source and click the Choose Connection button and select the new worksheet I get a pop up that says The type of connection selected cannot be used to create a PivotTable.p  pI also tried converting the csv file to xlsx but had a similar problem trying to get the existing pivot table to use it instead of the csv as its source.p
Negative 89007 pI got a problem with Cocoa and its View redraw hierarchy.p  pIm currently testing displaying audio levels in a meter style control and Im using the MeteringView class from MatrixMixerTest example project from apple. This class is drawing the meter and only drawing the difference what got changed which looks like a very efficient class. p  pMy project is splitted into 2 splitviews, in some are NSCollectionViews Scrollview, Clipview and in others are only static views. If I add the meter to those static views they work fine when these views call setNeedsDisplayYES. If a meter is added to the view of a CollectionView Item it gets rendered, but loosing its drawn old level parts and its cornersbackground. I think this happens because the CollectionView item gets also called to be redrawn which has a background image and everything is gone. It is drawing some parts whats currently changing the drawing works.p  pIs there a way to prevent the Item itself to be redrawn Or, I dont know why it is not happening in those static views, because those views also have background images but do not draw over the meter.p  pAre there some tricks or whats different in a CollectionView than in a normal viewp  pstrongEDITstrong After reading about isOpaque MeteringView isOpaque  YES means it should not call the parent views drawRect if set to yes. Well that works for the static views, those MeteringViews do not call parents drawRect, but those in a CollectionView do however. I dont know why.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong I gave this topic another title, because isOpaqueYES in MeteringView is not stopping calling the parents drawRect in a CollectionView, in a normal view it is working. Are there some things to know about I have to stop redrawing the CollectionView Item because thats the problem.p  pThanks in advance guysp  pBenjaminp

Negative 89007 pLooking for an efficient algorithm to match sets among a group of sets, ordered by the most overlapping members. 2 identical sets for example are the best match, while no overlapping members are the worst. p  pSo, the algorithm takes input a list of sets and returns matching set pairs ordered by the sets with the most overlapping members.p  pWould be interested in ideas to do this efficiently. Brute force approach is to try all combinations and sort which obviously is not very performant when the number of sets is very large.p  pEdit Use case  Assume a large number of sets already exist. When a new set arrives, the algorithm is run and the output includes matching sets with at least one element overlap sorted by the most matching to least doesnt matter how many items are in the newincoming set. Hope that clarifies my question.p

Negative 89007 pfirstly, is bod2d friction like mu in highschool physics  p  pI have a compound body with two wheels on revolute joints one of which has a motor.  When I try to drive it up an 30 degree slope my driven wheel spins and i dont get up.  I have set friction on all bodies as 0.9.

Negative 89007 pI recently took an interest in building websites and am still very inexperienced, so my apologies if this is easily answered.p  pI was asked by a friend to build her a simple portfolio website for fashion designs. As such, the website mainly has image galleries. The images come in various sizes and rather than ordering them manually to make it look better, I found the Masonry plugin. I implemented masonry.pkgd.min.js into my code initialized through the HTML and ran into two issuesp  ol lipThe main issue that might make question 2 moot entirely It looks fine in IE and Firefox, but the images come up overlapping in Chrome and it looks horrible. I cleared my cache several times and tried implementing the imagesLoaded plugin, which did absolutely nothing. I am very new to Javascript and as such have to rely on copypasting this sort of plugin whereas someone else might be able to delve in and tweak it, but at the same time I had no issues getting tabbed content and this does work in two browsers. Any idea why it doesnt work in Chrome and what I can do to fix itpli lipAfter the plugin, I dont seem to have any control over automatically centering the image columns in the gallerycontainer and they are aligned left by nature. I more or less fixed this by manually setting a marginleft that puts everything in the right place, but would like to know if there is a better solution.pli ol  pPlease let me know if I need to include screenshots or specific code.p

I have tried switching to when not matches and it redirects, so I am a bit baffled what I am doing wrong to get this to work.p  pAn example URL would be codehttpwww3.test.comfeedtesting.xmlcode If the directory feed exists in the URL then remove the www3.

Question is, what kind of pointer should be returned codestduniqueptrcode seems a good fit.p  pIn line 2 codeMovieModelcode is constructed, which takes a database connection as argument and stores it for future use. As one connection could be shared between one or more Models, database connection should be passed and stored as codestdsharedptrcode, I presume. But then, should I convert codestduniqueptrcode created by codeConnectionFactorycode to codesharedptrcode or modify codeConnectionFactorycode to return codesharedptrcodep  pIn line 3, an object being stored in database. As codeMoviecode is simple data class, it should be passed by value, or better, by const reference. Thats simple, but in line 4 another object is retrieved. Since codeMoviecode has value semantics, returning by value seems natural. But what happens when particular movie is not found Is it better to throw an exception, or change return type to smart pointer and return a codenullptrcode in that casep  pLast, a collection of objects is returned. Is it better to return a container e.g, codestdvectorcode of objects, or container of smartpointers. In latter case, which pointersp

Now we would like, for lets say  500 chosen devices with Type  254 create realtime report thingy, that lets you choose some period of time, interval every day, every 2 hours, 5 minutes or 5 seconds and on each resulting timestamp youd get last message before this timestamp.

Orderby descending and FirstOrDefault  used to get highest one. There is descending index on Timestamp.p  pWhats the problem with just running it in a loop Well, users would love to query long periods of time with small intervals quickly with fresh data last day, interval 1 minute, what means very big number of requerying of the same query with different parameter timestamp. For limited amount of data it queries tens of times of timestamps per second and I believe that query which would run once with list of timestamps to search for would finish much quicker.p  pIs there a way to connect multiple runs of this same query, to get much bigger batch of data at a time Im using EF5 but I am not afraid to write stored procedures and sql functions.p

Negative 89007 pI have a binary search tree class BST.h and a node class Node.h of which works fine when I store data types such as integers in it. My problem is trying store class objects in my BST and use an attribute from the object as the key. My program also has a student class which contains studentID and studentName. How would I write an operator overload in my student class so every time my BST preforms operation on nodes, it will overload to the student.getID, instead of operating on the object itself.

Negative 89007 pI am just starting to use Redis for the first time. I have gone through the documentation and I came to know that Redis can be used in replication mode.

Negative 89007 pIm editing other peoples CSS. Theyve used two media queries for iPad one for portrait, one for landscape that seem to be causing problems on some larger Android phones and phablets.p  pWhat I find so strang is that the CSS they have used is being recommended by just about everyone, even though it is highly vulnerable on Android devices. p  pWhat this query does is It uses a combination of mindevicewidth and maxdevicewidth to ascertain that the device is an iPad. It uses the orientation parameter to figure out if the device is portrait or landscape on iOS devices, the devicewidth is always the width in portrait mode, even if the device is currently in landscape.p  pThis is the CSS that seemed to be causing the problemp  precode iPad Landscape  media only screen and mindevicewidth 768px and maxdevicewidth 1024px   CSS     iPad Portrait  media only screen and mindevicewidth 768px and maxdevicewidth 1024px and orientation portrait   CSS   codepre  pNow the problem is that defining a minimum and maximum device width leaves a lot of room for these styles to be applied to other devices as well. Anything with a width between 768px and 1024px is being treated as an iPad.p  pIn my case, the style specifies that a custom button bar at the bottom of the screen be exactly 768 pixels wide. And some more stuff like that. That works on iPads but not on devices with similar but different widths. Buttons are falling off the screen on the Android devices involved.p  pSo what I am using now isp  precodemedia screen and devicewidth 768px and deviceheight 1024px and orientation  landscape  etc  media screen and devicewidth 768px and deviceheight 1024px and orientation  portrait  etc  codepre  pThis seems to target exactly all iPads. Ive understood that all iPads have a devicewidth of 768 pixels even if their resolution is higher.p  pSo Im pretty sure Im doing it right. But since this is pretty common issue and everyone else is saying to use MINdevicewidth and MINdeviceheight, Id still be really happy to hear someone else on this.p

Negative 89007 pWhen should one branchtag in Mercurial codehgcode, both at the local repo level and at the centralizedoriginating repo that you codehg clonecode When should you merge again at the local level and in the central repop  pI come from a SVN background where branches were used for new features emfeature branchesem, as well as emrelease branchesem. In the case of feature branches, a developer would create a branch if heshe knew a project was going to span multiple sprintsreleases. The feature branch would then be merged back in once the developer was certain theyd be releasing the new feature during the given sprint. The release branch would then be created and deployed to QA and a staging environemnt for QATUAT testing respectively. Any bugs that arose during testing would be committed directly to the release branch. When the release branch was finally ready to be released, it would be tagged for archivalrecordkeeping purposes and then finally, after the release branch was deployed live, it would be merged back with trunk.p  pHow does this process change with a DVCS such as codehgcodep

Negative 89007 pIn my codeUIViewControllercode I have a codeUIScrollViewcode and then a codeUITableViewcode inside of that. Im getting odd behaviour even without the codeUIScrollViewcode. When my codeViewControllercode is not subclassed my codeUITableViewcode on its own acts fine. I subclass the codeVCcode and all of a sudden the codeTVcode scrolls underneath my codenavBarcode. Theres nothing that Ive done in particular that I can see would cause this change, but since Im working with AutoLayout for the first time in all these years, it may be something there which Im overlooking. Anyway, I then fixed this manually with thisp  precodeoverride func viewDidLayoutSubviews      super.viewDidLayoutSubviews      var currentInsets UIEdgeInsets  tableView.contentInset     printlnInset from top, self.topLayoutGuide.length     self.tableView.contentInset  UIEdgeInsetstop self.topLayoutGuide.length, left currentInsets.bottom, bottom currentInsets.left, right currentInsets.right  codepre  pEverything works again as expected Even though I shouldnt have to do this. I then add in the codeSVcode into the mix and things go a little haywire again. The screen loads with the codeTVcode at codey 64code which coincidentally definitely not a coincidence what its codeInsetcode is set to. On touching anywhere, it snaps to codey 0code where it should always snap to and start at and then with a little scrolling itll go and snap to codey 49code. The codeTVcode seems to have 3 snap points as mentioned above, yet Im not sure why. The codeSVcode is set to have a scroll direction lock and paging enabled. Its codecontentOffsetcode is the codescreen heightcode which is why I dont understand why it would cause these problems x 2codescreen widthcode. If I remove my manual fix for the codeinsetcode, as expected the issue is just shifted up by 64. Only, the codeTVcode reports the same heights of 0 amp 64 cant make it snap to 49 which is understandable as it shouldnt count the inset toward its y scroll value in the scroll delegate.p  pAnyway, So I have absolutely no idea why my codeUITableViewcode inside a codeUIScrollViewcode is playing up to the extent it is. I was always under the impression that a codeUIScrollViewcode would automagically handle any content insets of its direct child elements including codeTableViewscode.p  pIf anyone could shed some light on this, Id greatly appreciate it.p  pRegards,br Mikep  pstrongUPDATEstrong The issue, I have since found, lies with the way Im setting my codecontentOffsetcode in codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode Im currently doing it like this codescrollView.contentSize  CGSizeMakeself.view.frame.width  2 , self.view.frame.heightcode. Still not sure why this line of code alone would cause the myriad of problems Ive experienced.p

Negative 89007 pOn Android 4.1 and above, I am using codeMediaCodeccode framework to decode H264 data. I see the codec instance that Im using via codecreateDecoderByTypecode supports multiple colorformats. However, it always gives the output in the 1stindexed colorformat from its supported list.p  pIs there a way to force the decoder to give out decoded data in a particular colorformat from the ColorFormats it supports I know the developer docs does mention that the key codeKEYCOLORFORMATcode can only be set for encoders, but then help me understand what is the rational of having multiple supported colorformats for decodersp

I am using the sparkshell console to run the above code. I am able to perform non trivial queries on the codedatacode SchemaRDD object afterwards, so it does not appear to be a resource issue. It is also possible to read and query the resulting Parquet file, it just takes an extremely long in due to the lack of summary files.p

Negative 89007 pIve been working on this game at the native Android NDK level. To start off with I had only a single texture but as my textures hit 5, my fps slowly reduced to about 20 with stutters from around 60. p  pCurrently im performing all my operations on a single thread. On the introduction of another thread using posix threads with a startroutine which loops infinitely and has no implementation, my fps seemed to have hit about 40 for no apparent reason.p  pAnother point here was that after introduction of that thread, the FPS was stable at 4243. But without the thread, there were stutters 1828 fps causing jerky animation.  My doubtsp  ol liWhy the above mentioned is happening thread relatedli liAlso, the only difference between when I was using 1 texture was that the calculations in my fragment shader are more now. Does that mean the GPU is being overloaded and hence glSwapBuffers taking more timeli liAssuming glSwapBuffers does take time, does that mean my game logic is always going to be ahead of my rendererli liHow exactly do i go about feeding the render thread with the information needed to render a frame As in do i make the render thread wait on a queue which is fed by my game logic thread Code relatedli ol  pCode p  precodevoid  startrender void  param       while 1             return NULL   void androidmainstruct androidapp state         Creation of this thread, increased my FPS to around 40 even though startrender wasnt doing     anything      pthreadt renderthread     pthreadcreateamprenderthread,NULL,startrender,NULL       struct engine engine      memsetampengine, 0, sizeofengine     stategtuserData  ampengine     stategtonAppCmd  enginehandlecmd     stategtonInputEvent  enginehandleinput       engine.assetManager  stategtactivitygtassetManager      engine.app  state     engine.texsize  4       if stategtsavedState  NULL           We are starting with a previous saved state restore from it.         engine.state  struct savedstatestategtsavedState            loop waiting for stuff to do.      while 1           Read all pending events.         int ident         int events         struct androidpollsource source           If not animating, we will block forever waiting for events.

Negative 89007 pFirst of all, Im really surprised that this is not a duplicate, because there are TONS of stackoverflow questions that solve this in ObjectiveC, but I have yet to see a good answer that used Swift.p  pWhat Im looking for is a code snippet in Swift that sends an arbitrary string as a the body of a text message to given phone number. Essentially, Id like something like a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeMessageComposerIntroductionIntro.htmlthisa from Apples official documentation, but in Swift instead of ObjectiveC.p  pI imagine this isnt too difficult, as it can be done in just a couple of lines of code in Android.p  pEDIT What Im looking for is 520 lines of Swift code, I do not agree that this is too broad. In Java for Android, the solution looks like thisp  precodepackage com.company.appname import android.app.Activity import android.telephony.SmsManager public class MainActivity extends Activity      protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         public static final mPhoneNumber  1111111111         public static final mMessage  hello phone         SmsManager.getDefault.sendTextMessagemPhoneNumber, null, mMessage, null, null        codepre  pNow this is the android solution, and its only 11 lines. Java tends to be much more verbose than Swift, so I doubt what Im asking is too broad, it is more likely that I dont know how to use the ObjectiveC MessageComposer object, because the documentation that I linked to above is unclear with regard to usage in Swift.p

Negative 89007 pI am trying to convert a C string to a cstring, or char. I want the hash function that takes a  char to always be calledafter converting from a string.

It has been a long day pp  pSomething interesting is that char a and char const a call the char method from main but not from the string method. Interesting. p

Negative 89007 pI need to shuffle a list from 0255 but without using a random function, as the list must be shuffled based on a string of length 10. What Im trying to do currently is as followsp  precodekey  testtest12 mapping  range256 codepre  pI then need to shuffle the codemappingcode list without just using coderandom.shufflemappingcode or something similar. My original idea was to add all the ordinance values of the key as suchp  precodekeytotal  0 for i in key     keytotal  ordi  for i, item in enumeratemapping     mapping[i]  mapping[i]  keytotal  255 codepre  pThis shuffles the codemappingcode list quite well, however it leads to duplicate values, whereas I need all values to be unique from 0255, just mixed into a different order based on the key. Please write your ideas if you have any.p  pThanksp

Negative 89007 pSo I have a class that holds a bunch of stat info and such about a gamer. Im trying to implement a mock trophy system for certain stat goals that were achieved through an RNG. I have a 2d codeintcode array that holds values for the gradelevel of the trophy, that once achieved upgrades the trophy from bronze, to silver, etc and a corresponding 2d codeStringcode array that holds the titles of such trophy levels. In testing what seemed to work with a now unused method actually provided trophies to only certain types. What I have now is a path I think I need to follow in order for this to work. I have a method called codegetBadgesint requestedStatcode that takes an index value for another array to view that stats trophies. In that method is a for loop that compares the methods argument to both 2d arrays to determine if the stats value stored in another array qualifies it for a bronze, silver, or gold trophy. My main problem is Im getting lost in how to access these different data points in my 2d arrays without going out of the indexs range. Not to mention when I set up a bunch of codeifelsecode statements my test output always produced the trophys name, but no trophy level. Like suchp  precodeHealer No Badge  Explorer No Badge  Socialite No Badge  Contributor No Badge  codepre  pAs the skill points go up so should the badge levels i.e. go from No Badge to Bronze etc. Is this a logic or syntax error Im super confused on what is happening in my code, despite my pseudocode efforts.

The event handlers are not in question here, so I omitted them.p  pThen, in the initialization of an arbitrary identity providerp  precodepublic class BarIdentityProvider  IIdentityProvider      public void InitHttpApplication httpApplication, ...              var authorizer  new BarAuthorizationProvider         authorizer.InithttpApplication, ...          httpApplication.PostAuthenticateRequest  httpApplicationPostAuthenticateRequest         httpApplication.AuthorizeRequest  httpApplicationAuthorizeRequest           ...  codepre  pAnd in the AuthorizationRequestHandler the following happensp  precodepublic class BarAuthorizationProvider      public void InitHttpApplication httpApplication, ...              httpApplication.PostAuthorizeRequest  OnAuthorizeRequest           ...  codepre  pAs you can see, there are events being subscribed to in FooModule, BarIdentityProvider and BarAuthorizationProvider which, to me, comes across as event spaghetti. Also, when doing thisp  precodevar authorizer  new BarAuthorizationProvider authorizer.InithttpApplication, ... codepre  pI do not expect the codeauthorizercode to subscribe to various events and work magically.p  pAs a software developer I expect eitherp  ol lione HttpModule which subscribes to the necessary events and requests the identity provider and authorization provider for identity and access information. Event handling is minimized in the providers.li limultiple HttpModules i.e. an authentication and an authorization module which each subscribe to the necessary events. Event handling is minimized in the providers.li ol  pAm I correct or are there arguments against my expectationp

This is similar to a realtime response systempolling system.p  pCurrently, I have this php code which takes the data from the databasep  precodeltphp   requireonce connectdb.php user  new User name  usergtdatagtusername count   ifissetGET[data]     data  pregreplace[09], , GET[data]     output       replies       first          connection  mysqliconnectlocalhost, root, , resp     sql  mysqliqueryconnection,SELECT id FROM list     num  mysqlinumrowssql     ifissetSESSION[answerarray]  SESSION[answerarray] lt 1         current  1     else         count  countSESSION[answerarray]          ifcount gt num         unsetSESSION[answerarray]         headerlocation link.php         exit          ifcount gt num         echo                  ltform actionusers.php methodpostgt                 ltinput typehidden namecomplete valuetruegt                 ltinput typetext nameusername value.name. disabledgt                 ltbutton class typesubmit valuefinishgtSubmitltbuttongt                 ltformgt         exit          sql1  mysqliqueryconnection,SELECT  FROM list WHERE iddata LIMIT 1         whilerow  mysqlifetcharraysql1             id  row[id]             a  row[data]              dataid  row[dataid]             first  lth2gt.a.lth2gt             sql2  mysqliqueryconnection,SELECT  FROM replies WHERE diddata             whilerow2  mysqlifetcharraysql2                 ch  row2[reply]                 val  row2[val]                 replies . ltlabelgtltinput typeradio nameradio value.val.gt.ch.ltlabelgt                  ltinput typehidden iddid value.id. namedidgt                                            displ  .first.,.answers.,ltinput type  submit name  submit valuesubmit onClick  postreplygt             echo displ                        gt codepre  pThis page outputs data with radio buttons, each with a different value.

Ive read up on a lot of push systems, nodes, socket.io, pusher, eventsource and I know how to send data to a clients page using the above ways and eventsource seems to be the easiest to use as Ive tried them all. Does eventsource handle manual push or does it only work with automatic updates Ive been cracking my had on this one for a while because Im not really sure how to send the data from the admin since this also involves mysql. I want to be able to push the data to the users from the admin rather than from the users.p
Negative 89007 pI created this temp converter in JavaScript, it runs and calculates appropriately, but I am receiving some unexpected behavior and Im struggling to understand why its happening. p  pThe behavior that is happening is  if I click in the Celsius or Fahrenheit textbox it auto produces values 32 in Celsius textbox, and 32 in Fahrenheit textbox.

Negative 89007 pWere developing software which uses DirectX for 3D rendering on Windows 7 and later machines, 64bit C.NET code.p  pWeve observed that a number of newer Dell laptops were testing on have dual video cards.  They have the Intel HD 4600 integrated graphics and they also have a faster NVIDIA Quadro card for example.p  pBy default, out of the box, the Intel graphics are used by the DirectX application.  This is done, presumably to preserve battery life.  But the performance is noticeably worse than the NVIDIA card.p  pUsing the NVIDIA control panel, the user can control which one is used by default.  As soon as the user switches it to use the NVIDIA card, the performance sees a big jump for the better.p  pSo, my question is....  Is there any way to, in code, detect this setting andor modify it for our application on install andor on launch  Can we detect that for our app the Intel card is being used and if its one of these dual card scenarios, prompt the user and perhaps if they request it change the setting for themp  pAs it is currently we have to walk the users through manually making the change in the NVIDIA control panel.p  pAnyone else have any experience dealing with this and have any advice on how to proceedp

This is because our application delivers a security token embedded in the JSON not in the header, as is typical.p  pWhat Id like to achieve is thisp  precodeobject AuthenticatedAction extends ActionBuilder[UserRequest] with ActionTransformer[Request, UserRequest]       Do something magical here that will      1. parse the inbound request.body.validate[GPToken]      2. do stuff with the token to check authorization      3. if NOT authorized return an HTTP NOTAUTHORIZED or FORBIDDEN      4. otherwise, forward the request to the desired endpoint   object SomeController extends Controller     val action  AuthenticatedActionparse.json  implicit request gt         request.body.validate[SomeRequest] match               Do whatever... totally transparent and already authorized                   ... codepre  pThe inbound JSON will always have a token, e.g.p  precode     tokenaf75e4ad7564cfde,      other parameters we dont care about  codepre  pSo, Im thinking to parse just want we want and strongnotstrong end up parsing complex, deeply nested JSON structures I could just have a GPToken objectp  precodeclass GPTokentoken String object GPToken  implicit val readsToken  Json.reads[GPToken]  codepre  pThen in the magic of AuthenticationAction I could deserialize just the token, do my thing with the database to check authorization, and either pass the request on or send back a NOTAUTHORIZED.

Negative 89007 pIn spark streaming, stream data will be usually received by a receiver which runs on a worker node. The data will be pushed into a data block periodically and receiver will send the receivedBlockInfo to the driver. I want to know that will spark streaming distribute the block to the clusterIn other words, will it use a distributing storage strategy. If it does not distribute the data across the cluster, how will the workload balance be guaranteedImage we have a cluster of 10s nodes but there are only a few receivers p

Negative 89007 pI am trying to insert column headers into a Python list. The csv file I am using does not have column names and the data is separated by commas. I am trying to write this program so that I dont have to insert column names into the csv file every time I make the weekly maps in ArcGIS. I could also turn the csv into a dictionary if needed. Either way would be fine. I have this code so far which produces a dataset that is useable. I know how to reference columns in a dictionary by column name. But the same method doesnt seem to work for inserting column names into a column position.p  precodeimport os os.chdirCUsersDesktop fileData  openSOUTH06012015SECFILE.CSV,rb  def dataHeader     headerLine  fileData.readline     valueList  headerLine.split,     yield valueList  def dataBody     for line in fileData.readlines         segmentLine  line.split,         yield segmentLine[06]  def dataPrinter     gen1  dataHeader     gen2  dataBody     printn     for row in gen2         print row dataPrinter codepre

Negative 89007 pLet me describe my setup. p  pUsing Debian. Ive got eth0 connected to my home router. A MACVLAN named m0 is created from eth0. A TAP device named tap0 is created using tunctl. Finally, a bridge named br0 is created using bridgeutils and both m0 and tap0 are connected to the bridge.p  pUsing ping, I was able to capture an example ICMP request from tcpdump. First, I used dhclient to get br0 an IP address from the home router. Next, I ping the router from br0. I then capture this packet in tcpdump. p  pNext, I write to the tap0 interface in Python. Once I get the file object, I copy the example ICMP request from before it has IP address from br0 to 192.168.1.1, which is home router, convert it to binary, and then write it to the file object.p  pUsing tcpdump, I can see the packet I wrote to the file object in Python appear just as intended  an ICMP echo request. I can see this packet on every interface in the chain tap0, br0, m0, eth0.p  pHeres the problem Im trying to tackle. I can see the ICMP echo strongreplystrong on every interface in the chain, except tap0 br0, m0, eth0 using tcpdump. Ideally, I want to read from the file object in Python to see the ICMP echo reply there. It makes sense that what I have doesnt work, since the bridge is the one with the IP address in the reply packet. How do I modify this setup such that I can both read and write from tap0p  pdhclient doesnt work with tap0, however. The only way I could imagine this working is somehow finding a way to give tap0 an IP address that is known by the router. I hope I dont have to implement a dhclient in Python that writes through the tap0 file object.p  pThis setup was inspired by the networking needed in VMs. Im trying to experiment with the system infrastructure necessary for a user space program to write data to the wire and being able to read the data back from the wire. p  pThanks for the responses and sorry for the somewhat lengthy post.p  pCommands from Terminal top  ol liCreate macvlan m0 codesudo ip link add link eth0 m0 type macvlancodeli liCreate TAP tap0 codesudo tunctl u rootcodeli liInitialization of network devices codesudo ip addr add 0.0.0.0 dev m0tap0code codesudo ip link set dev m0tap0 promisc oncodeli liCreate and link bridge to m0 and tap0 codesudo brctl addbr br0code codesudo brctl addif br0 tap0m0code codesudo ip link set dev br0 upcode codesudo dhclient br0codeli ol  pIn Python, Im doing stuff similar to the initialization steps of a hrefhttpsgist.github.comglacjay585369 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comglacjay585369a p  pFrom there I just have a file object referring to the tap0 interface that I open with codeos.fdopenTAP0FD, rbcode and that I can write to and read from, as in the explanation above.p

Negative 89007 pI made a small webapp using java EE and tomcat 6. Everything works 1 when tested on localhost. I packaged my webapp and deployed it on our test server. Sometimes it works as intended and sometimes I get 404 error while accessing the url.p  pSome infosp  pIm using tomcat 7 on the server could the change in version be the problem. Server uses https. My index page is in WEBINF and is mapped to a servlet. The webapp is actually deployed on 2 servers which toggles I show the hostname at the top of my app and I can confirm both works.p  pOther note  When I get the 404 error, refreshing doesnt work right away, it can take a few minutes before it works again. While Im getting 404 error when I call the URL mapped to my servlet, I can still call test.html which is outside of WEBINF and it will display properly. It feels as if the mapping isnt done properly sometimes. Could it be a problem with web.xml  p

Negative 89007 pemIm an angular newbieem using the a hrefhttpngtable.com relnofollowngtablea directive. p  pstrongTLDRstrong Is there any way I can tell ngtable to redistribute the items in the table according to items per page after table has finished loadingp  pstrongThe long storystrong I have a collection of items including subitems that I bind to the ngtable and that works just fine with pagination and items per page selection. My problem is that when I try to apply a filter, the table leaves the items on their original pages. Lets say that I have 5000 items in the table, spread over 500 pages each containing 10 items. The filtering I have implemented works just fine but it leaves the items on the original pages, for instance, if an item with STId1826 is initially put on page 4512 and I filter for 1826, it will remain on that page, even if there are no more items in the entire collection. Of course, this is because the ngtable is already loaded and needs to reload for this to work. But I figure, since the collection is already in memory on the client, there must be some way to redistribute the items.p  pI know there is a native ngtable filter function but suffice it to say that I see no way it is possible for me to use.p  pI have a collection of itemsp  precodeSigningTasks [            CS Init,       STId 6637,       CivicNumber 198301101997,       Culture          CultureId 1,         CountryCode SE,         LanguageCode sv,         Name Sverige, svenska       ,       Status InitDone,       DateCreated 20150626T134513.723,       GroupName Group1,     ,     ... ] codepre  pand table parametersp  precodevm.tableParams  new ngTableParams     page 1,     count 10,     sorting          DateCreated desc      ,      total vm.List.length,     counts [10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000],     getData function defer, params          var filteredData  filterfiltervm.List, params.filter         params.totalfilteredData.length          var orderedData  params.sorting  filterorderByfilteredData, params.orderBy  filteredData         defer.resolveorderedData.sliceparams.page  1  params.count, params.page  params.count       codepre  pand a tablep  precodelttable ngtablevm.tableParamsgt     lttr ngrepeattask in data  filtervm.filterTasksvm.CivicNumbergt     ...     lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pand a filter functionp  precodevm.filterTasks  function civicNumber      return function task          var includeItem  true          if civicNumber  null ampamp civicNumber  undefined ampamp civicNumber                includeItem  task.CivicNumber.includescivicNumber                  return includeItem               codepre

Negative 89007 pIve looked at so many stack overflow questions to find my solution, but none of the questions I try are what I am looking for so if you know of one that fits my question, please tell me. What I have is a php page that processes a form. It looks like thisp  precodeltphp var1  htmlentitiesPOST[var1] var2  htmlentitiesPOST[var2]  conn  mysqliconnectlocalhost,user,pass,db query  INSERT INTO table var1,var2 VALUES var2,var2 doQuery  mysqliqueryconn,query  ifdoQuery       this is where script should go i think to send the variables to the email page headerLocation pathtonextpage  this just sends the user to the next page. NOT PART OF EMAIL PAGE   else  headerLocation pathtobackpage   mysqlicloseconn gt codepre  pso its a basic form handler that sends you to the next page if all goes well. p  pI have another page that is sends an email notification to someone when they successfully go through the first page. It also processes all of the other email notification worthy forms as well. thats the reason I cant just take the script and put it into the top page. p  pSo, what I am trying to do is figure out a way to send the codevar1code and codevar2code to the email file without completely redirecting the user. I dont need a response back from the email file.p  pI hope that made sense. p  pthanks in advancep

Negative 89007 pI have this problem on an HTML5 app.  It works perfectly fine with Safari and Chrome on iOS, but the problem occurs on Android devices.p  pWhenever a form with input fields is displayed and I try to enter any details, the soft keyboard covers the fields, instead of shifting them up.  On smaller devices, like phones, it is impossible to see what you are typing.  p  pI need to add that this is even worse when running the app added to home screen, in full screen mode.

Negative 89007 pI have made some full screen renders using OpenGL ES 2.0 on Andorid devices.p  pIn these renders I used a custom fragment shader that uses a uniform  time parameter as part of the animation.p  pI have experienced major image tearingmassive fps drops and pixelated result as the render went on. After playing around with values and trying to fix it, I found the problem to be in the size of the time parameter, as the value got bigger and bigger the result got worse. changing the float precision to codehighpcode in the fragment shader didnt help,but the animation got worse at a later time then before, as youd expect.p  pI found a solution by limiting the size of the parameter before it was sent to the shader, by using the mod operator on it.p  pOn the other hand, I copied the exact shader code into a browser that runs a webgl environment to render the same thing that runs on my phone, and there is no problem with the parameter size, no fps drop, no nothing.p  pI can understand that the graphics card on mobile devices is weaker then what I have on my pc, and it is only natural to assume that my pc graphics card can hold much larger values.p  pstrongBut, my question is, what possible solution can I work with to go around this problem of parameters sizesstrong p  pI would like my animation to go on forever, and not be forced to loop around after 5 seconds.p  pHere is a link to the website with the animation a hrefhttphearthforge.co.nfmagni relnofollowwebsite linkap  pnot actually forever but a quite a long time, just like in the browesr.p

Negative 89007 pI am trying to understand how Java Flight Recorder samples an application which use a native library through JNA in my case.p  pLets write a test case which will spend most of its time in native landp  precodepublic class Main       interface MyLib extends Library          long doStufflong seed           public static void mainString[] args          MyLib myLib  MyLib Native.loadLibrarymylib, MyLib.class          LongStream.range0, 10                 .mapmyLibdoStuff                 .forEachSystem.outprintln       codepre  pdoStuff being a slow, cpu bound, functionp  precodeint64t doStuffint64t acc      for int i  0 i lt 1ltlt30 i  acc  i      return acc  codepre  pdoStuff takes 2s to execute on my machine and main completes in 30s. I run this test case with jdk1.8.060 using the following JVM options codeXXUnlockCommercialFeatures XXFlightRecorder XXFlightRecorderOptionsdefaultrecordingtrue,dumponexittrue,dumponexitpathjna.jfrcode.p  pWhen I open codejna.jfrcode I see that the dump contains a strongsinglestrong stack trace event. As I understand it, and unlike most profiler, JFR does not generate stack trace events when native code is running. I perfectly understand that JFR does not profile native code but I had expect stack trace events being generated with a stack trace truncated at javanative code boundary.p  pIs something wrong with my setup or is it the expected behavior  I find it really error prone. If you dont carefully verify the sample count, it is so easy to believe that hotspots are in Java code while most of the time is spent in native code. p  pIt is also impossible to know where are the most expensive native calls which is why you use a profiler in the first place p
Negative 89007 pSo about a year ago i have taken over the development and management of the database for the organisation i work for. inhouse developer.p  pThe organisation is a national organisation, but started out in one state.

Negative 89007 pI was wondering for a while now, why does a specific same font look a lot prettier on a Linux system ie Ubuntu, Mint and Mac Os X than on Windows especially xp. It simply seems that they are rendered with more antialiasing or similar, as they are a lot smoother on the edges. They also seem thicker. Comparing Linux, Mac and Windows, on the last font looks the worst and it looks really bad on Windows XP. Is this all only in my headp

Negative 89007 pI recently have had the need to put several Components, a JTextPane among them, inside of a single JScrollPanes viewport view.

Negative 89007 pI have two different versions of Xcode installed on a build server.  Want to run some build jobs with latest Xcode 7 and some with earlier Xcode 6.4 can I do it  Figure I will need to script out a way to switch between using xcodeselect but it seems to require usage of sudo to run xcodeselect.  Can this be done without using sudo  Or is there a shell command andor arrangement so I dont need to manually enter roots password when doing the switchp
