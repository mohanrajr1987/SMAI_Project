Positive 938 pIm encountering an incredibly frustrating linker issue. Im got two dynamic code.socode libraries, one which defines codegprlogcode called codelibgpr.socode and another which uses it called codelibgrpc.socode. p  pIm attempting to link an executable like sop  precodeusrbinc myobjfile.o o myexec rdynamic lib1.a lib2.so libgpr.so libgrpc.so codepre  pOutputsp  precodeusrbinld libgrpc.so undefined reference to symbol gprlog libgpr.so error adding symbols DSO missing from command line codepre  pHeres the part where you want to jump in and tell me that codelibgpr.socode needs to be provided after codelibgrpc.socode.

Positive 938 pAfter reading a hrefhttpembeddedgurus.comstatespace201402areweshootingourselvesinthefootwithstackoverflow relnofollowthis Embedded Gurus articlea about stack overflow, Im interested in reversing the order of static RAM and the stack in an embedded baremetal ARM project.  See the following diagramp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coml0FHE.png altstack ordering diagramp  pstrongCurrentstrong All static RAM data is placed into the overall RAM section.  The Start of Stack address is fixed at the highest RAM address and provided as a linkerdefined symbol.p  pstrongReversedstrong This would be simple if the Static Variables section were of fixed size but the size changes as variables are addedremoved.  What I would like to do is place all the static RAM data into the end of RAM and then determine where the stack should start based on the size of the static RAM data.  That Start of Stack address would then be provided as a linkerdefined symbol.p  pIs there a way to have a section of variable size to hold static RAM data at the end of the overall RAM section  If not, how could this reversal be implemented without requiring a fixedsize section for static RAM datap

Positive 938 pI am working in a very big C project to create a big shared object where we are using an external SDK which have several header files and several shared libraries which belong to each other.

To that end I defined a codeSingletoncode as followsp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class Singleton  public     static T instance          if minstance             minstance  new T          return minstance       private     static T minstance   template ltclass Tgt T SingletonltTgtminstance  nullptr codepre  pThis appears to work just fine provided my application is compiled as a single executable. When I start using plugins, i.e. codedylibcodes opened with codedlopencode, I get multiple instances of the codeSingletoncode.p  pNormally I compile my application with codefvisiblityhiddencode. If remove that option, meaning I use codedefaultcode visibility, then the codeSingletoncodes behave properly. This led me to think I just need to export the symbol using codeattributevisibilitydefaultcode but this doesnt work.p  pWhat is going here, and what would the solution bep

Positive 938 pIve got a number of lowlevel functions, typedef and define that I tend to reuse among multiple source codes.p  pUp to now, I made the simpler choice to copypaste and adapt the relevant parts to their host context. I would like to change this design, grouping relevant prototypes by logical themes, providing each theme into its own code.hcode.p  pThe code.hcode design is selected over a code.ccode because most functions defined are very short and expected to be inlined, for performance reason. While Visual for example is doing a fine job at inlining functions from different code.ccode, gcc and clang on the other hand dont do it by default. Recent versions made it possible, by using codefltocode switch, but thats still recent, and certainly not default. By contrast, the codeinclude theme.hcode does not suffer such limitation.p  pHowever, there is still a last drawback  functions defined into the codetheme.hcode will be exported as symbols within the code.ccode including it. If 2 or more code.ccode in the same program include the same codetheme.hcode, it results in a symbol conflict at link stage.p  pThe solution to this problem is supposed to be simple  make these functions codestaticcode. Thats what Im used to do, thats also what the stb singlefile public domain libraries does. However, the fact that now codetheme.hcode is generic means it contains all useful functions of a given theme, and some of them might be unused by the calling code.ccode. In which case, the compiler generates a warning  codefunction XXXX defined but not usedcode.p  pA warning is not an error, indeed, but in a clean production chain, no warning is tolerated. So a solution must be found.p  pThe stb library collection does not seem concerned by this issue, so I could not find any hint there.p  pA first solution could be to disable the warning. And it works, but require compilerspecific flags, extensions or pragma. For example, in codegcccode, it can be done using codeWnounusedfunctioncode.  However, its more complex than that  I dont want to remove the warning for the whole project, since it can be useful in other parts of the code. I just want to disable it for the functions defined into codetheme.hcode typedefs and defines are already fine. Its possible too, using codeattributeunusedcode in front of each function. But thats gcc specific. For Visual, Ill need something else. For clang, I dont know yet. And there is always a risk that another compiler will need something else.p  pI tend to shy away from such complexity, because there are too many compilers out there, and they constantly evolve. So such a solution would require maintenance.p  pAnother possibility would be to declare these functions codestatic inlinecode. In which case, the codefunction XXXX defined but not usedcode warning is no longer issued. codestatic inlinecode has the pretty big advantage of being codeC99code standard.p  pSounds good, but there are still a number of compilers in use today which are not codeC99code standard MS Visual is probably the biggest one. These compilers are not necessarily current  there are still a lot of systems out there which are not exactly up to date. And I would prefer a solution which can work for them too.p  pThat being said, being at least codeC99code compliant seems like a relatively mild requirement by 2015, so it should prove okay for a growing majority share of compilers in use. The most important exception is Visual here, with codeC99code only supported since VC2013, hence a relatively recent version. Therefore, its quite likely that older versions such as VC2012 or VC2010 remain in use today and within the next few years.p  pSuch older Visual versions could probably use Visualspecific keyword codestatic inlinecode. Thats one work around, but only for Visual. For all other potential nonC99 compiler out there, Im out of luck.p  pIm currently considering to use codestatic inlinecode by default for C99 compliant compilers, with codestatic inlinecode as backup for Visual, and just codestaticcode for all others.p  pI was wondering if there was a better solution to this problem.p  pem[Edit]em  as stated by Jonathan Leffler, the correct spelling is codestatic inlinecode. Thats what I meant but I was too lazy and only wrote codeinlinecode.

Negative 938 pI use MySQL in my ASP.NET app with the MySQL .NET Connector, is there anyway to programmatically check whether the db server is down I came across MySQLConnection.Ping but unfortunately that doesnt work the way it should the connection has to be opened first using Open, also it keeps on returning false even if the DB Server becomes available again. The only solution I came up with is to use the Open method, if that throws an exception then the DB server is not available, is there a more reliable way to do this I read somewhere that using Open might not work as expected if connection pooling is used, this could result an exception being thrown even if the DB server is up.p  pIf you want the details please read onp  pIn my app, I log all exceptions first I try to log them to the DB Server  could be the same DB Server thats down but could be not, depending on the configuration  if that fails the exceptions are logged to a text file. Now I want to handle the case if the DB server is down, normally what will happen is that exceptions will keep on being thrown with almost every request to my app, this means the log will be full with those exceptions, the other problem is that Ill keep on serving error pages to users or in other words the users will keep on seeing error pages with every request they make to the app, what I want to do is that if a db exception is thrown ie. of type MySQLException to check whether the DB server is up, if not then change some flag in my app and serve a page that contains something like the application is temporarily unavailable the flag is checked in an httpModule and redirects or transfers to that page. Im also planning to make it send me an SMS using an SMS proxy so that I could take an action, but this another story and is not related to this question.p

Negative 938 pI have a bit of code Im running to test multithreading in MATLAB mex functions I know MATLAB isnt thread safe... Im just playing around to see what happens.  The entry point to MATLAB C code functions has the signature of the mexFunction function in the code snipped at the bottom of the post.  Since I want to essentially pass the arguments from this function into another thread created using pthreads, I need to bundle everything up into a structure.  The signature of the mexFunction which I cannot change includes an array of pointers to mxArray, however I cant directly include an array of pointers to mxArray in the structure definition since then I couldnt assign to that field of the structure cant assign to an array.  For example, this doesnt workp  precodetypedef struct MexFunArgs    int nrhs   const mxArray prhs[]  MexFunArgs   ... now within the mexFunction ...   MexFunArgs mfa  mfa.prhs  prhs codepre  pA first thought to fix this is to change the structure definition to thisp  precodetypedef struct MexFunArgs    int nrhs   const mxArray prhs  MexFunArgs codepre  pHowever, then when I use this structure in the other thread, I would need to cast back to an array of pointers in order to pass it to the mexCallMATLAB function, which as far as I know cant be done please correct me if Im wrong here.p  pSo, I thought instead I would change the structure definition to thisp  precodetypedef struct MexFunArgs    int nrhs   const mxArray prhs[]  MexFunArgs codepre  pI.e., a pointer to an array of pointers to mxArray.  This solves the assignment issue though the compiler still complains about incompatible pointer types for reasons I dont understand.  However, it turns out the mexCallMATLAB function doesnt take an array of pointers to const mxArrays, but instead an array of pointers to nonconst mxArrays.  So now Id like to know if theres a way of casting away the const aspect of my pointer to an array of pointers to const mxArrays.  I have no idea how to do that... the following isnt legalp  precodemxArray [] codepre  pCan it be done  If not, is what Im trying to do pass these arguments to the other thread unscathed in such a way that they can be used without the compiler whining possible in some other way in Cp  pThe following is the complete code Im using at the moment, which runs as expected, but produces a warning when compiled.

Negative 938 pI would like to transfer user name and password information from one process to another process running on the same server in Windows. What is the best approach to achieve this transfer in a secure way One simple approach is to copy the passwords to a file and then have the other process read from a file and then delete the file once it is read. Though this is simple I am concerned if it is secure though since it is still possible for someone to gain access to this file even though it lives only for a short period of time amp also has the possibility of the file being left out if the other processes errors out or crashes. IPCs like sockets and named pipes seems to be an overkill for this problem. I am more inclined towards using memory mapped files as explained in this link below which talks about sharing memory across processes. Is this the right approach Also, is it a good idea to fill the memory with dummy data prior to freeingerasing to prevent rouge processes from scavenging data from this memory locationp  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa36655128VS.8529.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa366551VS.85.aspxap

The huge drawback of this is that if someone leaves a transaction that causes a message insert open for extended periods of time, locking against that common messaging table causes other clients and messaging in general to come to a screeching halt.p  pWe experimented with using an extended stored procedure to do direct socket connections to our apps, but this led to similar blocking problems when something inevitably went wrong with the connectivity.p  hr  pWhat Im really looking for is a good mechanism from within SQL Server ideally SQL Server 2000 and up, but SQL Server 2008only would also be OK to fire off a message of some sort.  The message mustp  ol liBe readable by an arbitrary client program from within a database transaction,li liNot add extra locking burden on the database, andli liBe fast.li ol  pPersistenceguaranteed delivery would be very nice but not absolutely required.p  hr  pIve looked at strongMSMQstrong but I dont fully understand the documentation.  I understand that there is such a thing as a message transaction in strongMSMQstrong, and that it is possible to fire off messages from an extended stored procedure or CLR proc, but how bulletproof and fast is it in this contextp  pAny advice you can offer would be much appreciated.p  hr  pEdit  To clarify, I need a way to send to at least one application other than the calling app.  This is a notificationbroadcast requirement, so the RAISERROR suggestion below is unsuitable.p

Negative 938 pIn the interpreter for my experimental programming language I have a symbol table. Each symbol consists of a name and a value the value can be e.g. of type string, int, function, etc..p  pAt first I represented the table with a vector and iterated through the symbols checking if the given symbol name fitted. p  pThen I though using a map, in my case codemapltstring,symbolgtcode, would be better than iterating through the vector all the time strongbutstrong p  pIts a bit hard to explain this part but Ill try.p  pIf a variable is retrieved the first time in a program in my language, of course its position in the symbol table has to be found using vector now. If I would iterate through the vector every time the line gets executed think of a loop, it would be terribly slow as it currently is, nearly as slow as microsofts batch.p  pSo I could use a map to retrieve the variable codeSymbolTable[ myVar.Name ]codep  pBut think of the following If the variable, still using vector, is found the first time, I can store its exact integer position in the vector with it. That means The next time it is needed, my interpreter knows that it has been cached and doesnt search the symbol table for it but does something like codeSymbolTable.at myVar.CachedPosition code.p  pNow my rather hard questionp  ul lipShould I use a vector for the symbol table together with caching the position of the variable in the vectorpli lipShould I rather use a map Why strongHow fast is the [] operatorstrongpli lipShould I use something completely differentpli ul

Negative 938 pHello I am working with the Kate editor based on the lack of other good tools for Scala development, I am also using IntelliJ however it still has some bugs, and are slow enough to make me impatient. p  pI have just startet using both Kate and SBT, and in that regard I have a little challenge I hope there is an answer for out there on The Internet.p  pI am using the standard Build plugin in Kate and has changed the commands from make to sbt. This works fine, and I am also getting a error report when the sbt fails during compile time. However I really wish to know if it is possible to integrate the compile errors into Kate such that it would be shown under Errors and Warnings instead of just in the output tab, where I have to do a manual search for the compile errors. p  pIm guessing that it has something to do with the format of the output, if that is the case maybe it is just a smaller adjustment I need to make to the parsing language.p

Negative 938 pIn one of my Django projects that use MySQL as the database, I need to have a emdateem fields that accept also partial dates like only year YYYY and year and month YYYYMM plus normal date YYYYMMDD.p  pThe emdateem field in MySQL can deal with that by accepting em00em for the month and the day. So em20100000em is valid in MySQL and it represent 2010. Same thing for em20100500em that represent May 2010.p  pSo I started to create a codePartialDateFieldcode to support this feature. But I hit a wall because, by default, and Django use the default, MySQLdb, the python driver to MySQL, return a codedatetime.datecode object for a emdateem field AND codedatetime.datecode support only real date. So its possible to modify the converter for the emdateem field used by MySQLdb and return only a string in this format emYYYYMMDDem. Unfortunately the converter use by MySQLdb is set at the connection level so its use for all MySQL emdateem fields. But Django codeDateFieldcode rely on the fact that the database return a codedatetime.datecode object, so if I change the converter to return a string, Django is not happy at all.p  pSomeone have an idea or advice to solve this problem How to create a codePartialDateFieldcode in Django p  h2EDITh2  pAlso I should add that I already thought of 2 solutions, create 3 integer fields for year, month and day as mention by emAlison R.em or use a emvarcharem field to keep date as string in this format emYYYYMMDDem.p  pBut in both solutions, if Im not wrong, I will loose the emspecialem properties of a emdateem field like doing query of this kind on them emGet all entries after this dateem. I can probably reimplement this functionality on the client side but that will not be a valid solution in my case because the database can be query from other systems mysql client, MS Access, etc.p

Negative 938 pI have what I assume is a fairly standard setup, with one scratchpad MOC which is never saved containing a bunch of objects downloaded from the web and another permanent MOC which persists objects. When the user selects an object from scratchMOC to add to her library, I want to either 1 remove the object from scratchMOC and insert into permanentMOC, or 2 copy the object into permanentMOC. The a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.commaclibrarydocumentationcocoaconceptualCoreDataArticlescdFAQ.htmlCore Data FAQa says I can copy an object like thisp  precodeNSManagedObjectID objectID  [managedObject objectID] NSManagedObject copy  [context2 objectWithIDobjectID] codepre  pIn this case, context2 would be permanentMOC. However, when I do this, the copied object is faulted the data is initially unresolved. When it does get resolved, later, all of the values are nil none of the data attributes or relationships from the original managedObject are actually copied or referenced. Therefore I cant see any difference between using this objectWithID method and just inserting an entirely new object into permanentMOC using insertNewObjectForEntityForName.p  pI realize I can create a new object in permanentMOC and manually copy each keyvalue pair from the old object, but Im not very happy with that solution. I have a number of different managed objects for which I have this problem, so I dont want to have to write and update copy methods for all of them as I continue developing. Is there a better way p

Negative 938 pIve created a custom UIView which overrides the drawRect method using Quartz.

I draw a number of artifacts with different RGB values set using CGContextSetRGBStrokeColor and CGContextSetRGBFillColor. These all work fine until I try and set a nonzero value for all 3 RGB values.p  pTo illustrate if I use CGContextSetRGBStrokeColorcontext, 1, 1, 0, 1 then I get a yellow line.

Also this is all working fine when the alpha of the view is set to 1.0 ie I can draw white without any issues whatsoever.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts or suggestions as to what might be causing this or how I might diagnose the problemp

I think this problem has something to do with when the query actually executes and it may have to do with the filters I am applying to the query see below.p  pUser Layer Codep  precodegrdSelectedQuestionaires.DataSource  assessment.FilteredAssessmentListfilter grdSelectedQuestionaires.DataBind lt Fails  Cannot access a disposed object codepre  pBusiness Layer Codep  precodepublic IQueryableltAssessmentgt FilteredAssessmentListAssessmentSearchFilter filter              using PAQcDataLayerDataContext dc  new PAQcDataLayerDataContext                      var rows                       from a in dc.vPAQSummaries                     select new Assessment                                              PAQNumber  a.PAQNumber.Trim,                         CustomerID  inta.CustomerID,                         Department  a.Department.Trim,                         CustomerName  a.CustomerName.Trim,                         DOTNumber  a.DOTNumber.Trim,                         OrgName  a.OrgName.Trim,                         DateEntered  a.DateEntered,                         GroupNumber  a.GroupNumber.Trim,                         JobTitle  a.JobTitle.Trim,                         FileNames  a.FileNames.Trim,                         AnalystType  a.AnalystType.ToString,                         Incumbents  a.Incumbents,                                     Filter by Customer ID             if filter.CustomerID gt 0                              rows  rows.Wherer gt r.CustomerID  filter.CustomerID                          else                              rows  rows.Wherer gt r.CustomerID  null                             Filter by DOT Number             if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.DOTNumberFrom                              if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.DOTNumberTo                                      rows  rows.Wherer gt r.DOTNumber  filter.DOTNumberFrom                                  else                                      rows  rows.Wherer gt r.DOTNumber.CompareTofilter.DOTNumberFrom gt 0                         ampamp r.DOTNumber.CompareTofilter.DOTNumberTo lt 0                                              Filter by OrgName             if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.OrgName                              rows  rows.Wherer gt r.OrgName.StartsWithfilter.OrgName                             Filter by Group             if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.GroupNumberFrom                              if string.IsNullOrEmptyfilter.GroupNumberTo                                      rows  rows.Wherer gt r.GroupNumber  filter.GroupNumberFrom                                  else                                      rows  rows.Wherer gt r.GroupNumber.CompareTofilter.GroupNumberFrom gt 0                         ampamp r.GroupNumber.CompareTofilter.GroupNumberTo lt 0                                            if filter.Skip gt 0                              rows  rows.Skipfilter.Skip                          if filter.Take gt 0                              rows  rows.Takefilter.Take                          else                              rows  rows.Take100                           return rows.Distinct                codepre

Negative 938 pLooking for some opinions on this and trying to start pushing forward with a solid design to my next project.  Imagine 5,000,000 individual pictures with accompanying lores preview images each set of pictures belongs to a gallery, which belongs to a person.  There are X number of people.  A specialized version of Flickr, so to speak.p  pThese are housed on a remote host with a web interface for viewing these pictures.  There is also a desktop application to go along with it where you can upload pictures automatically to this remote host and enter the gallery details.  The desktop app has preview images and information about each gallery and person.  A desktop app that syncs with Flickr, so to speak.p  pI need to decide on two things backend storage for the remote host and local storage for the desktop app.  This is targeted for a Windows environment, so I was thinking that SQL Server Express would be a nice fit, but this project has grown quite a bit and that may only work for the desktop end.p  pThe remote web server can be Windows or Linux, PHP or .Net  I dont care as long as the technology fits.  The question is how best to store all that data on the web server so that it can be easily indexed, quickly accessed, and, most importantly, easily backed up and restored in the event of a disaster.  I am not worried about server configuration or disk space at this time, as long as the database solution supports something of a cloud computing scenario.p  pIm thinking a NoSQL backend makes the most sense, storing the photos, galleries, and users as articles rather than rows.  NoSQL seems more capable of growing with a cloud. On the flipside, Flickr has been advertised as using MySQL ...p  pPerhaps this is a more existential question that a real coding question, but I know of no better group to askp

When the first thread exits the critical section and does an up on the mutex, do all 10 threads wake up and just resume what they were about to do, namely, entering the critical section Wouldnt that mean then that all 10 might end up in the critical section at the same timep

Negative 938 pSo I have an ASP.NETVB web application in which Im using both RequiredFieldValidators and CustomValidators. However, I have been having some major issues with all the validation. When you click a Next button to go to the next page of the form without filling in the required fields, all the RequiredFieldValidators fire and the error messages show up, but after a moment it still goes to the next page. Sometimes after changing what seem to be unrelated parts of the code, it starts working again, and works for awhile until I change something else. The CustomValidators are even more inconsistent, sometimes working, sometimes firing but not preventing the user from moving to the next page, and sometimes not working at all, but only stopstart working when I change code that seems like it shouldnt be effecting it. Sometimes one works and one doesnt. Whats driving me crazy about this is it seems so random. And I cant seem to pinpoint what changes in the code actually effect this.

This ranking strategy is frequently adopted for competitions, as it   means that if two or more competitors tie for a position in the   ranking, the position of all those ranked below them is unaffected   ie, a competitor only comes second if exactly one person scores   better than them, third if exactly two people score better than them,   fourth if exactly three people score better than them, etc.p      pThus if A ranks ahead of B and C which compare equal which are both   ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 first, B gets   ranking number 2 joint second, C also gets ranking number 2   joint second and D gets ranking number 4 fourth. In this case,   nobody would get ranking number 3 third and that would be left as   a gap.p blockquote  pCode in any language would be really helpful.p  pAs an aside Id be interested to see algorithms for the other ranking types modified competition ranking, dense ranking, ordinal ranking and fractional ranking.p

Negative 938 pIve had a look at many other questions regarding this I know there are alot, but none seem to satisfy my query.  Basically I have a view controller which includes two UITextFields.

Negative 938 pI am writing a program that involves placing one number into each cell of a 7x7 grid. There are 56 numbers, chosen from at random, and there must be no repetition. p  pThe end result should be a 7x7 grid in which each cell contains an integer from 1 to 56, with no two cells containing the same number. What is the most efficient way of doing thisp  pextra words I tried creating a for xfor y that would go through the grid cell by cell and add a random number 156. It would then check a 56slot array to see if that number was already in use, and correspondingly either reroll or accept the number, then flag the array to mark the number as in use. For some reason, I couldnt get it to work, and it seemed like a bad solution. I scrapped it, and instead had a second for xfor y run each time and check the entire grid cell by cell for the rolled number before approving or rejecting it. This also didnt quite work and seemed unwieldly, so I scrapped it as well. p

Negative 938 pIve build a librarystyle SQLite iOS app using the code in the Recipes sample app, and it works  updates on one device are eventually reliably propagated to all other devices running the same app. Ive been testing it with multiple events per hour all day long, and all the log transactions do get to every device. However, the time for the updates to propagate is highly variable. If I bring the app up and let it sit, it could be a relatively long time before the cloud sends update transactions to the app, and so whats onscreen remains old data for that same long time. Worse, theres no indication the data is out of date.p  pIf I cause the app to post a change to the cloud, though, updates strongemfromemstrong the cloud propagate down relatively soon. That suggests that I could put in a hack that periodically posts pointless changes to the database, but even then I wont know if Ive received all the changes.p  pFirst question Do methods that will force transactions to propagate exist a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9184264icloudupdatepolicyoncoredataindevelopmentandproductionmodea This threada suggests not. p  pSecond question Is there a way to detect if the local database is out of date I dont want to tickle the cloud copy incessantly, but doing so now and then until the database is current might not be such a bad idea.p

Negative 938 pIm fairly new to OO programming specifically with Java.  I have a question pertaining to inheritance.  p  pI have a printing method that Id like to be common among subclasses.  The code in the print method is usable for all subclasses except for a response object that is specific to each individual subclass.  p  pIm thinking that i need to probably just override the method in each subclass providing the specific implementation.

This works, but the overhead of starting new processes and handling XML files is a performance issue.li listrongUse RJBstrong.

Negative 938 pI have a scenario where I am using Entity Framework in a WCF service, and changes happen on a nontracked instance of a type that is mapped back to the database via codefirst nontrivial updates and deletes throughout the instances object tree.  When I try to attach the nontracked instance into the context, EF is only recognizing changes to the simple value types on the root object.p  pDoes anyone know of an elegant solution for this scenario  I am looking for a way to do this by using a generic repository, and avoiding having to run through the instances entire object tree managing the attachdetach state of every object.  I have considered possibly using ValueInjecter or AutoMapper to run the changes on a fully hydrated and tracked instance of the old state in order for the context to pickup the changes.  Also, how would Nhibernate handle this situationp  pThanks in advance for your inputp  pstrongUPDATE 7312012strong  I have updated the code to handle genericlytyped keys, and some typing issues with EF Proxies.

Lester has a list of words that he wants to print, not in the usual alphabetical order, but not in random order either. He decided on a method to sort the words that he calls AlphaFun order. The AlphaFun order method sorts the words using the following procedure 1.first compare the 2nd letter of the words 2.then compare teh 4th letter of the wordsthe 4th letter will be considered to be a space in words containing less than 4 letters. 3.compare the last letter of the words the last letter will always be the last letter of the word, not a space. 4.finally compare the first letter in the words. 5.if all of the above are the same characters, then the words used for those letters are sorted alphabetically.p  pnote these examples Wordsp  pEGG  p  pEGGS p  pBREAD     p  pALPHAFUNp  pG SEp  pGSSEp  pRADBp  pInput the input files contains and unkown number of lines, where each line of inputer contains a single word consisting of 3 to 10 letters. output you will print the words in alpha fun orderp  pexample input file BREAD AERIE BROAD EGGS EGG WALLETp  pexample output to screen WALLET AERIE EGG EGGS BREAD BROADp  phow could we do this problem we have been stuck on it for like 2 hours.p

Negative 938 pWe have a complex C codebase targeting multiple mobile platforms.

We also already tried to compile unit tests on Linux and questions already came too small business volume so far, but that might change to get it working on some other Linux platforms.p  pWe currently compile the code with native tools for each platform. Each of them is pretty complex and has some hacks in or around it to achieve reasonably singleclick builds. And for Bada, we didnt solve builds outside of the Samsungtweaked Eclipse yet, which well have to do for production.p  pSo far it works, but is becoming more and more of a maintenance problem. The biggest problem currently is the iPhone build, because unlike Visual Studio project files and plain makefiles, its not possible to addremoverename files in XCode project by hand and only two people have MacOS boxen and any experience with XCode while everybody has Windows and knows Visual Studio. We also need to create some makefiles for the Bada target its plain GNU toolchain, so anything capable of crosscompiling with those should do and I wouldnt mid getting rid of some of the kludges in Android build fix for bug in dependency handling when building under cygwin, some hacks on top of the ant build script and shell glue to massage manifest and hold it all together.p  pSo I am looking for advice on ways to unify the build process for this set of diverse platforms.p  ul liIt absolutely has to handle building the iPhone and Bada executables and the native part of the Android build because nobody has all three platforms to test separately.li liHas to handle large project consisting of several shared libraries, one main binary, one test binary for the same platforms and some auxiliary binaries built only on some platforms well, currently Win32 only.li liHas to be able to generate build configuration header and Java file with version from version control system and some userdefied variables, since we do 18 and counting slightly different builds for various customers.li liAnd of course it has to automatically handle dependencies header files and generally be reliable.li ul  pFor the other things I am prepared to hack around any deficiencies, but I would obviously like to keep the amount of shell duct tape and spit to minimum, so it shouldp  ul liBe able to integrate with Visual Studio, Eclipse and XCode enough that each environment can trigger build, upload the build product to the respective target and attach debugger to it there.li liBe able to build Java and call the custom packaging tools for Android, so we dont have to hack around the ant build script that Google gratuitously and incompatibly changed twice in last two years already and old SDK cant be downloaded.li liBe able to install various data files and call random packagers and random other scripts and tools and stuff, so it does not have to be mixed with too much shell script.li ul  pWe have so far started trying a hrefhttpcmake.org relnofollowCMakea didnt have much time, so didnt get far, but will have to do something shortly and also thought about a hrefhttpscons.org relnofollowSConsa. However I have already tried building with SCons for Windows CE a few years ago, but since it generates makefiletype projects for Visual Studio and those didnt work for embedded platforms in VS2005, I gave up.

Negative 938 pi had made a web app where you enter what your listening to and it tweets it... now Im trying to make it into an app. My original app, a web view with reachibility was rejected for being too much like a web app, which apple recommended i make a web app instead. Now i am changing it do it can detect what song you are currently listening too and uses the built in twitter. I found some documentation for the twitter functions, and NONE for the music... if you could just tell me how i would detect what the person is listening to, and then how to tweet it with additional text beforeafter the name of the song their listening to... thanks Also, is it possible to have the app send the song name to a web server and then send the text that would be in the tweet back Only because the web version has iTunes links that matches with the song if you wanna buy it, and the only way for that to work is through a php script on the web server...p

Negative 938 pIm struggling to find a suitable solution to this. I have a fairly large SQL Server 2008 Express database containing 60 tables many with key constraints and a whole bunch of data.  p  pI need to essentially copy all of these tables and the data and the constraints exactly from one database to another.

Database B is set up and has its own user. I just need to get the tables and the data intact from A to B. I can them modify my web.config connection to use the login credentials for database B and it should work.p  pIve tried backing up database A and restoring to database B via Management Studio Express, but it tells mep  blockquote   pSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlError The backup set holds a backup of a database other than the existing databaseB database.br   Microsoft.SqlServer.Smop blockquote  pIve also tried right clicking database A in Management Studio Express and going to codeTasks gt Generate scriptscode. But when I do this and run the SQL scripts on database B I get a whole load of errors to do with foreign keys etc as it imports the content. It seems like its doing the right thing, but cant handle the different keysrelationships.p  pSo does anyone know of a simple, surefire way of getting my data 100 exact and intact from database A to database Bp  pI think I used SQL Server Database Publishing Wizard to do something like this about 5 years ago, but that product seems to be defunct now  I tried to install it and it wanted me to regress my version of SQL Server to 2005, so Im not going therep  pThanks folksp
Negative 938 pIf I wanted to do large amounts of data fitting using matrices that were too large to fit in memory what toolslibraries would I look into  Specifically, if I was running on data from a website normally using phpmysql how would you suggest making an offline process that could run large matrix operations in a reasonable amount of timep  pPossible answers might be like you should use this language with these distributed matrix algorithm to map reduce on many machines.  I imagine that php isnt the best language for this so the flow would be more like some other offline process reads the data from the database, does the learning, and stores back the rules in a format that php can make use of later since the other parts of the site are built in php.p  pNot sure if this is the right place to ask this one would have asked it in the machine learning SE but it never made it out of beta.p

Negative 938 pI want to biuld a simple PHP framework. I have worked in CI and Kohana. And have basic know how of Yii. But I also used Django and really impressed by django. I want to start a small project that is based on Crud or login e.t.c. so I am thinking of creating a small framework with it too. So that in next project I can have better place to start and will definitely add more things next time. There for, I need some components. Basic things that I liked in django is that it dont just generate code like Yii that generate more code that result in larger code base that one need to manage while maintenance. It just render many things from less code. So developer can maintain that less code more easily. While he can simply modify the things by overriding methods that he want.p  pI dont have much time so I will definitely start from some smaller components that are available. Right now I liked the PHPActiveRecordPattern lib. for db access. I think it use PDO at low level. Now I want to get advise for other components, mentioned below. p  ol lipI want django like or better superb forms lib. that I can integrate into my framework. I think I can get some thing from PEAR with form processor that can be extended with validation.pli lipSome login,registration related lib. if there is some thing flexible and good already available. It seems like I need to write it myself based on my requirements although it is simple.pli lipSome view and model renderer, to implement simple MVC layers. pli lipSome PHP lib. that can generate some files Although these files will not have much code in them but for basic structures.pli lipSome better routing lib. pli lipThumbnail and email classespli ol  pWhile there are already so many frameworks having some of above things, then the purpose of writing my own framework is to have a simple framework, that is quick, simple and that result in less code maintenance overhead at the end of developer. So that one good developer can develop better websites quickly with less overhead, without know different things smarty e.t.c. p

Is there a way to designate all subprocesses opened by a python script as notfocusedp  pCLARIFICATION I need the window to open and be viewableselectable, just not immediately jump on top of everything else that is going on. In other words, it need to open in the background, not force itself into the foreground.p

Negative 938 pI am developing an application using spring webflow and primefaces and use mysql. The problem is when i register the date for example 15.may. 2012. it register correct in database but when i display it. it shows one day before 14.may.2012. I use this tag to display the date and I believe that    which add 1 day to the displayed date. Another thing which i remarked is that when i debug i see the time displays like this Wed May 09 000000 CEST. Which i believe is in Central European Summer timezone .

I dont like this solution because it ties up an IO worker.p  pSolution 2 Make codeMyClientHandlercode in to a bidirectional handler and get the attachment using a codeThreadLocalcode in a codebindRequestedcode downstream callback. I dont like this because it relies on a Netty implementation detail that the requesting thread is used to fire the codebindRequestedcode event.p  pI find solution 1 to be more tolerable than solution 2.

Negative 938 pOur ASP.NET MVC 3 intranet application makes use of Windows user authentication, and also demands that users are in a certain role to access administrative sections authorization. While all this works, we find that checking a users role membership is really slow 20 seconds. We use either the codeUser.IsInRolecode method or codeAuthorizeAttributecode. Even if we check against the local Administrators group BUILTINAdministrators instead of an AD group its still as slow.p  pNow, is there some recommended scheme we may follow in order to speed up user authorization Is it common for instance to cache a users authorization status in a database Is there, more fundamentally, something fishy going on since authorizing against a local group Administrators is this slowp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe Web server is running on Windows 2008 R2 SP1 x64, .NET 4.0, IIS 7.5, 4 GB RAM.

Negative 938 pI have an element in my case a HR tag that needs to be as wide as the browser but which is also wider than its parent container.  However, it still needs to maintain relative positioning so that it scrolls vertically with the page.

Negative 938 pI have a question regarding organization of properties in viewModel. As far as I understand the viewmodel should be as simple as possible, and the main thing that it should do is bind data to view.p  pThe question is how to distinguish properties in viewmodel from BL model. I mean for example I have a BL model like  p  precode   public class UserDetailsModel               public string UserName getset         public string SomeInfogetset         public string AnotherInfogetset         public string Anythinggetset         public string Something getset         ...        codepre  pthen I have another BL model sayp  precode public class UserInfoModel                       public string Info1getset             public string Info2getset             public string Info3getset             public string Info4getset             public string Info5 getset             ...            codepre  pNow the question is what is the best practices to Create ViewModel that should have data of both BL models. p  p1 Duplicate the properties from 2 models , and use Default Model binding to transfer data from view to controller , then create BL models from ViewModels and via repository update data  In this case we have code duplication ... p  p2 ViewModel should look something like p  precode public class UsersIdentificationViewModel                       public UsersIdentificationViewModel                              UserInfoModel  new UserInfoModel                           public UserInfoModel UsersInfo  get set               public UserDetailsModel UserDetails  get set               codepre  pThe default binding will not work in this case Correct me if I am mistaking and I should write custom Model binder or something like this... What approach is better for unit testing , or maybe there is another approach p

Negative 938 pI have an Eclipse plugin that needs to open a pair of sockets to a flash application running on the local machine. Flash requires a policy file blob of XML giving permissions to access the ports in question. Flash prefers to get this policy file over port 843, Java treats ports lt 1024 as privileged ports and Mac OS X and Linux similarly restrict access to ports lt 1024. I dont want to run my Eclipse plugin with root permissions, so serving up the policy file on port 843 is not an option. According to Adobe documentation, if Flash cant get the policy file on port 843, it falls back to requesting the policy file on the port to which its trying to connect. The ActionScript code looks like thisp  precode    Connecting to some port to communicate with the debugger.

To include the dynamic editors I use a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10088975displaydynamiceditorsinjsfwithuiincludecustom includea. p  pThe source code of DynamicInclude, DynamicIncludeComponent and DynamicIncludeHandler can be found at a hrefhttppastebin.com5e2dgR15 relnofollowhttppastebin.com5e2dgR15a. I had to remove the lines that tested the src for null in codegetSrccode method of DynamicInclude and changed codegetFamilycode to return a not null value. It is the only implementation of a dynamic include that I could find and use in my case. At this moment, I dont have the knowledge to make a better one. Having a dynamic include is crucial to my project because it is used in lots of placesBalusC I would love to see such component being add in OmniFaces if its possible.p  pMy problems with the absolute client id are related with the way the id gets generated for the codeltcustomincludegtcode. In my case is codetabs0editorsGroup4editor3code. I have seen that naming containers, such as codeltpdataTablegtcode or codeltptabViewgtcode, add a number to the idtabs0, editorsGroup4. I am not sure if this custom include is 100  a NamingContainer.  DynamicIncludeComponent implements NamingContainer, but I cannot use an absolute client id as codetabseditorsGroupeditorcode.p  pFor the codeorganizationUnitcode editor from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12688674determineabsoluteidDetermine absolute ida, I have used a workaround in the update for codeabsoluteidoforganizationunitcode. With codeeval.getAbsoluteIdcc.clientId, organizationUnitcode, the absolute client id was calculated, after some parts of the cc.clientId have been removed. p  pI have tried to do the update with the help of a codeltpremoteCommandgtcode, but it didnt worked. So I have thought I could do a similar workaround as for the codeorganizationUnitcode editor. For this I had to obtain the parent id, the first parameter for the getAbsoluteId method.p  pThese are the reasons from my strange request.p

For example, down i put the code from the chrome logo from the webpage that appears on chrome browser when the web page doesnt exist.

Negative 938 pIm looking to create a dynamic resource in tastypie.

Im overriding the constructor for a class that inherits from ModelResource, and in this constructor Im attempting to set the tastypie relationships.  However when I review my resource the data is not being populated.  p  precodesetattrself, field, fields.ForeignKeyclassthing, attributefield, fullTrue codepre  pBasically Im using setattr in the constructor to try and hook up what the relationship should be.

I can also do codeCc ,code in clojuremode in emacs, and it does the same thing. Great Now the question all this runs the clojure installation I have in codeclojure1.4.0code, which I see by typingp  precodelein repl codepre  pin a project directory.  I have a new installation of clojure in codeclojure1.5.0code now, and I would like to make leiningen and emacs point to that new version.  However, during the setup of leiningen and the emacs mode, I never manually told them where to find the clojure version. They found that magically and opaquely  in fact, the whole process was very magic, and that was great at that time. I suppose I could tear everything down and build it up again from scratch, but that seems bruteforcedly inefficient.  I could also hackreplace the files in the 1.4 directory with the files from the 1.5 directory.  That might work one time, but its so obviously wrong I really dont want to think about it.  I need to do this the right way so that when the next version updates come along, I can keep the toolchain going as smoothly as possible.  p  pI am just starting with all this, so I am  far from mastery of any of these tools and Ill be grateful for nooblevel advice on keeping it all  going.p

Negative 938 pI have been reading a bunch of posts, questions, and articles on the use of the codewithcode keyword in JavaScript. Some of the articles warn against the use of Javascripts codewithcode keyword, so Id like to know if my use is appropriate. p  pMost of my programming experince is in C and Java, so when creating related objects namespacing them made sense to me. p  pThe approach I am trying is to first create the root namespace as a globally accessible object. The objects members are the first level namespaces which are also objects. p  pWhen to add object to the namespace, I use the Javascript codewithcode keyword to make the members of the argument locally accessible withing the scope of the with.

Graph 2       codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netk3WJN2 relnofollowstrongJSFIDDLEstrongap  pThis shows the graph that has its radio button checked off when it loads. However, when I click the buttons, they dont change. I did some research and found that I likely need to include the change function. Here is what I triedp  precodedocument.readyfunction       input[namechart]radio.changefunction           if chart1Pie.attrchecked               ... Graph 1          else if chart1Bar.attrchecked               ... Graph 2                codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netk3WJN1 relnofollowstrongJSFIDDLEstrongap  pThere are a few things wrong with this. 1 The selected graph does not load when the page is loaded. 2 When a radio button is clicked, only the pie chart appears. 3 When the other radio button is clicked, the previous graph does not go away it just puts the new one below it.p  pIve looked at several StackOverflow questions, and none of them solved the problem. Can someone help me out Thanksp

Negative 938 pI was playing around with threads using pthreadcreate and mutexes, but I noticed that in my simple example an int value that I store in a struct passed into pthreadcreate doesnt retain its value when the thread executes method SimpleThread. Below is the code. Specifically, in line 63 I assigned the count on the loop to the int id in the struct thread that is used as a parameter in pthreadcreate. In line 22 where I print out the value of id from the struct it always gives the same value. If I create 2 threads, the value is 2. If i create 3 threads, the value is 3. The pattern continues. I guess Im just curious why this happens instead of getting the actual value of i like I intended in line 63.p  precode1    include ltstdio.hgt 2    include ltstdlib.hgt 3    include ltpthread.hgt   4    include ltunistd.hgt 5 6    define PROGRAMNAME 0 7    define NUMTHREADS 1 8 9    int SharedVariable 10   pthreadmutext mutex 11 12   struct thread 13    14     pthreadt t 15     int id 16    17 18   void SimpleThread void arg  19    20     struct thread parameter   struct thread  arg 21     int which  parametergtid 22     printf Threads IDs in SimpleThread  dn, parametergtid  23 24     pthreadmutexlock ampmutex  25 26     int num, val 27 28     for num  0 num lt 20 num  29      30       if random  gt RANDMAX  2  31         usleep 10  32 33       val  SharedVariable 34 35       printf thread d sees value dn, which, val  36       SharedVariable  val  1 37      38 39     val  SharedVariable 40     printf Thread d sees final value dn, which, val  41 42     pthreadmutexunlock ampmutex  43 44     return  void   arg  45    46 47   int main int argc, char argv[ ]  48    49     int numthreads, i 50 51     if argc  2  52      53       fprintf stderr, Usage s ltnumthreadsgtn, argv[ PROGRAMNAME ]  54       return 1 55      56     numthreads  atoi argv[ NUMTHREADS ]  57     struct thread container   struct thread  malloc numthreads  sizeof struct thread   58 59     pthreadmutexinit ampmutex, NULL  60 61     for i  0 i lt numthreads i  62      63       container[ i ].id  i 64       pthreadcreate ampcontainer[ i ].t, 0, SimpleThread, ampcontainer  65      66 67     for i  0 i lt numthreads i  68      69       pthreadjoin container[ i ].t, 0  70      71 72     pthreadmutexdestroy ampmutex  73 74     return 0 75    codepre

Negative 938 pIm trying to use cytoscape.js to display large networks with hundreds of nodes. However, cytoscape.js seems to always want to constrain everything to the viewport, which can be problematic if there are too many nodes crowding up the viewport. Im using the arbor layout and during the forcedirected simulation the nodes dont seem to exit the viewports initial boundaries, even if I zoom out at initialization. Setting arbors fit option to emfalseem also doesnt seem to do anything. What is the preferred way to go about displaying large networks in cytoscape.jsp

Negative 938 pI need to minimize Tomcats response header. The device sending requests to tomcat is very limited in memory, so I want to remove the headers Date, Server and ContentType. I set up my own valve with an action hook. The hook gets called, but it seems to be impossible to remove the date and server header.p  pFirst I executed my method only when codeActionCode  COMMITcode  didnt work. Strange. So I looked in the Tomcat source code In the method action of Tomcats codeAbstractHttp11Processorcode when codeActionCodeCOMMITcodep  ul licodeprepareResponsecode is called which sets the server and date headers and thenli liit writes the headers to the output buffer.li ul  pSo it is not possible to intercept. When I set the headers before this action gets called they get overwritten in the codeAbstractHttp11Processorcode. When I set the headers after that, they will be ignored, as they were already written to the buffer. My only chance seems to be to reset the output buffer and write the headers to the buffer or is there a better way And is it even possible to do thatp

Negative 938 pIm fairly new to access and I need some insight on the way Im setting up two tables. I am in the business of tracking equipment procurements. I have one table that has the main unit, quantity, makemodel information along with some other purchasing details.  We have unique numbers associated with every main unit. So say we want to order a T.V. that number is and always will be 12345. Well, now we are required to track accessories individually and I am thinking it would be best to have a separate Accessories table. The problem Im running into though is since there can be different numbers of accessories and different quantities its throwing my numbers off. When I run a query or report it shows multiple records for the main unit.p  pI want the query to list the rows separately like this.  p  precode ID    Desc    Qty    Type 12345   TV      3   Main Unit  12345   Cable   3   Accessory  12345   Mount   2   Accessory  codepre  pInstead it lists the first line two times so it looks like there is a total of 6 units. p  precode12345   TV   3   Accessory   Cable   3  12345   TV   3   Accessory   Mount   2  codepre  pIt might be a simple fix and Im just having a brain fart or maybe I should put the accessories in the main table, Im not sure. Any adviceinsight would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 938 pInstead of starting off every value at 0 like c normally does, I am wondering if there is way to start at a specific number like 1 without having to loop through replacing every 0 with 1 after initializationp
Negative 938 pIve only just started C and am trying to make a backend for my python. At the moment I have a cumbersome system of writing huge input files at least 106 floats from the python then initialising the C which has to load in lots of other data as well running the C until termination, receiving its output only to have to reinitialize it again with a new input array.p  pIm not sure if it is conceptually possible from looking around but I was hoping to just be able to direct the C to a memory address for a numpy array and use it as though it is an array made by the C. The aim is for the python to initialise the C, build its first array, run the C code until it is ready for the next array which will then be generated by python.p  pThis is some dummy code that I wrote to try and get C to read numpy arrays. At the moment the C just has a segmentation fault and Im not sure if its because Im bad at C, it doesnt like reading the numpy arrays or a bit of both.p  pFront.pyp  parrayinterface was from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11264838howtogetthememoryaddressofanumpyarrayforcherea.p  precode usrbinpython  import numpy as np import subprocess as sp  ray  np.array[x3.14 for x in range10] addr  ray.arrayinterface[data][0]  pro  sp.Popen[.back, hexaddr] print pro.communicate[0] print ray[5] quit codepre  pBack.cp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainchar argv[]    float addr   int n   float a[10]     Hopefully making a pointer to the first float in the np.ndarray   addr  sscanfargv[1], x    n  0   while nlt10        Hopefully stepping through the np.ndarray one float at a time.     a[n]  addr     addr     n       Return the first five values to compare with python.   fprintfstdout, f f f f fn, a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4]   return 0  codepre  pIs it possible to have C read numpy arrays like this or is this approach fundamentally flawed Is there a better way of doing it if this does work, is it possible to use a Ctype bool, that both processes know the address of, to coordinate which process is working and which is waiting  e.g. python sets the value to 1 as it initialises the numpy array the C is waiting stuck in a whilespbool1 loop. Then when python is finished it changes the value to 0 and the C executes, finally changing the value back to 1 when it finishes.p

Negative 938 pI do know Java, but switch case...

First 4 I know what the cases are, they each do different things.p  pFrom 5 to N1, all of them do the same, only difference is, if its the case 7, the value it has to evaluate is P7, and so on.p  pCan I somehow use a loop for that N can get as big as 100000, itd be plain bad doing it by hand.p  pCloser Ive get to what I look for a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavajavaOOenum.html relnofollowhereap  pwhen it saysp  precodefor Planet p  Planet.values  System.out.printfYour weight on s is fn, p, p.surfaceWeightmass  codepre  pBut I dont need to iterate every value, just from 5 to N1.p  pPlease tell me if I havent explained myself, which would be the usual thing.

Negative 938 pWe are experiencing a very odd and troubling issue with one of our PHP applications. The application uses ZF2, PHP 5.3, and Apache 2. The three attached screenshots represent the network data associated with three consecutive requests which are sent one after another in rapid succession. We always expect to get back applicationjson. When the app craps out, one of the requests will show contenttype texthtml. This is not a matter of specifying the response headers, because which api route returns the texthtml contenttype is variable.p  pAlso note that the response that has contenttype texthtml will always have a contentencoding set to gzip see first screenshot, whereas the successful requestresponses will not have this set. The failing response will have empty response data according to Chrome dev tools, although there is a contentlength. There are also other minor differences the requestresponse that fails will have a vary response header set.p  pThis issue is pretty difficult to reproduce. Using a web browser, logging in clicking a view to init api requests, then logging out, rinse and repeat until it bug appears appearance rate is very random.p  pHas anybody experienced anything similar to this before Any tips or suggestions are welcome.

Negative 938 pI understand how mostly everything works in a loop in Java but I came to a realization that I am failing to understand one thing which is The Order a Loop Operates.p  pBasically I am failing to understand this because of this simple but boggling piece of code that was displayed in my class, the code is displayed below.p  precodepublic class Test      public static void main String[] args          int sum  0         for int k  1 k lt 10 k  2                      sum  k             System.out.printsum                   codepre  pThe output the program puts out is 1 4 9 16 25p  pNow I understand how it repeats and spits out the numbers but how does it go about even creating 1. Now you can say it created 1 by taking k and adding it to sum but shouldnt k be equaling 3 p  pIt goes k  1 This sets k equal to 1. k lt 10 Checks if k is less than 10. Then the question is when k  2 Shouldnt k now equal to 3 but instead sum is now somehow equal to 1 after this operation occurred of adding 2 to 1, 2  1  3 but 3  0  1 How does this even go about.p  pMy rationalizing for this is that any program I thought was to interpret code line by line or uniformly and not jumping around.p  pOverall my question is, how is sum equal to 1 when k is actually equal to 3.p

Negative 938 pSidenote Im not sure if this question belongs on the game development stack exchange site  but, I feel it belongs here since, while the context is a game, the algorithm itself that Im looking to implement is fairly application agnostic. Furthermore, Im not looking for a high level technique, as I feel that I have already established one, but instead Im seeking more specific help to a certain problem. Anyhow, to the questionp  pHey everyone p  pIm working on a multiplayer game that requires that the server can perform pathfinding for servercontrolled entities. The server is a straightup C application, and the client uses the Unity game engine. Using Unity on the server is not an option. Furthermore, I would like to avoid native libraries completely.p  pIve already examined Detour for pathfinding, and though they do have C ports, Id rather have my own implementation of the actual pathfinding bit as the process straightforward enough and Id like it to be tailored to my needs so that it plays well with the existing components on the server.p  pUnity comes with builtin support for RecastDetour. This is good, since I can use Recast in Unity to generate the navigation mesh then consume it on the server using my own pathfinding. The problem is that I cannot seem to find a proper way to generate a graph based off of the mesh created by UnityRecast.p  pWhat I need to do is create a graph, in memory, where each node is a triangle in the mesh, and each edge of the graph connects two triangles that are adjacent to eachother.p  pThe only data Im able to extract from Unitys API are the vertices and triangle indices of the generated mesh, so Ill need to reconstruct my own graph. My first implementation simply created a node per triangle, and if that triangle shared two other points with another triangle, to create a link between them  forming the edges of my graph.p  pWhile this works great for the majority of the mesh, it falls short because it seems that Unity is spitting out meshes that can have connections edges between areas polygons even if they dont share two vertices. Here is an example of Unity overlaying its generated navmesh onto my level geometry Unity does merge triangles into convex polygons, while my code does not  however, the problem still exists in either casep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXLBF6.png altUnity Navmeshp  pIn this example, my generated graph needs to connect the polygons separated by the white line which I cant find any documentation that explains why its rendered as white in Unity but is unable to do so since they only share a single vertex.p  pIm wondering if there is an efficient algorithm for detecting these cases. What Im thinking of doing is having it so that polygons are considered connectedp  precodeif sharedVertexCount  2     connectPolygons else if sharedVertexCount  1     Vector3[] parallelLine  findParallelLineSharedByBothPolygons     if parallelLine  null         Vector3 otherPoint  getUnsharedPointInLineparallelLine         if isPointInLineparallelLine, otherPoint             connectPolygons codepre  pI emthinkem this should work, but Im not finding a way to do this efficiently. Also, Im having a bit of trouble with the isPointInLine implementation as apparently my math skills are rustier than I thought.p  pEither way, there emhasem to be a simpler solution yet Ive found nothing online that points me in that direction... which is why Im asking you fine folks if theres anything I can do to efficiently turn the generated navmesh into a graph of connected polygons. Either help with my implementation of isPointInLine or pointing me in the direction of a more sensible algorithm would be appreciated beyond words.p

Negative 938 pI was looking for solutions to appending strings with other primitives and found that stringstream was the easiest solution.  However, I wanted to streamline the process so I wanted to make a function to ease its use.  In case you are proposing alternate methods for concatenation, i need the final result to be char.  I used a loop i withp  precodestdstringstream ss ss ltlt test ltlt i       char name  new char[ss.str.size  1]allocate strcpyname, ss.str.cstrcopy and put charcstr in name codepre  pSo the output is something link test1test2test3...  This was the most reasonable solution I could muster.  I was trying to put it into a function for ease of use, but am running into problems. I wanted to do something like  p  precodechar stringtopointer char dest, stdstringstream ss      char result  new char[ssgtstr.size  1]    strcpyresult, ssgtstr.cstr    return result  codepre  pI could then do something likep  precodestdstringstream ss ss ltlt test ltlt i       char name  stringtopointer name, ampss  codepre  pIm pretty new to c and this seems like the correct use syntactically, but I am running into runtime issues and would welcome solutions on how to get this in an easy to use function without resulting to Boost.p

Negative 938 pIm having a strange issue I cant seem to troubleshoot with my view. Im using a directive that generates a treeview of my website.

Ive inspected elements and they all have codeoptionselectedcode Stranger is that, when I click on a single option, all others disappear and only the selected option remains. Ive checked the source in Chrome console and yea only the selected option tag remains. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com62et9.png altenter image description herep  pFor exmaple the Site Lists select box has multiple options but when I clicked on Old documents, they others all disappeared.

Negative 938 pAnd this includes the subquestion How is an opencart token generatedp  pI ask this because I have made an installation of opencart that was copied DBs and everything and only the respective codeconfig.phpcode and codeadminconfig.phpcode were modified caches were all deleted and this was done like 30 times.p  pAll is fine and all stores work. Their respective store owners have different passwords and are able to log in and manipulate their stores. The thing is... All stores are accessible as sub folders of my domain.p  precodedomain.comstore1  domain.comstore2  etc. codepre  pHeres the kicker Logging into one store with the owners password say codedomain.comstore1admincode works ok and generates a token for the session. The problem is... that the token is now accepted in all stores whose owner are different people with different passwordsp  pSimply by changing the url fromp  precodedomain.comstore1adminindex.phproutecommonhomeamptoken3b029982197b80009b608328508aade2 codepre  ptop  precodedomain.comstore2adminindex.phproutecommonhomeamptoken3b029982197b80009b608328508aade2 codepre  pworks and now Store owner 1 has access to Store owner 2s admin panel without ever knowing or entering his password.p  pQuite criticalp  pHow do I make it so that this is not possible.

Negative 938 pSo I had this small argument with my lead over comparing codeStringscode with codeequalscodep  pI was using the following codep  precodeifproductCode.equalsLKP     ....  codepre  pHis argument was since codeequalscode is not null safe we should not code like this as this may lead to codeNullPointerExecptioncode  and we should avoid codeNPEcode at all code. So the code should bep  precodeifLKP.equalsproductCode     ....  codepre  pMy argument was that this might hide serious logic problems and possible bugs if codeproductCodecode is codenullcode. We would not get any exception and waste lots of time in figuring out the bug since codeproductCodecode is not suppose to be codenullcode. p  blockquote   pExceptions are there to tell us something is wrong and we need to fix it. p blockquote  pBut since he was adamant so I had to change it.p  blockquote   pSo my question is emWhat is the better approach to compare a String variable with a String constantemp blockquote  pstrongEditstrong I am using Java 6p

Negative 938 pSome apps like browsers have a bar at the top with several icons and an EditText input field.p  pSometimes the icons leave little room to show the input. It may be sufficient for just viewing the current URL  search term, but when the field gains focus it is desirable to expand the field to fit the whole screen, and have the other icons presumably in the same LinearLayout or RelativeLayout pushed out of the screen. Doing it smoothly would be a really nice effect.p  pWhats the best way to accomplish this That is, to gradually change the EditText width from the initial width determined by its ViewGroup until it matchesparent and, of course, the reverse animation is required when the field loses focus.p  pDoes the answer change based on the minimum SDK level required, since property animations were not introduced until 3.0p

Negative 938 pI am trying to perform some bitwise operations on a given key for a hash table program.  The methods that I am trying to figure out are folding, midsquare, truncation, and radix.  I am not expecting anyone to give me the direct answer, but help send me in the right direction. I cannot find any correspondence or help online that refers to this, or any algorithms that may help.  I have a bitwise program that shows some of the operations on binary numbers, such as shifting, XOR, OR, ANDlt and so on.  What I am not understanding is how to select only one portion of a 32 bit binary number, such as in midsquare, where you would select the middle four bits, and use just those in the operation. I have tried several things, but the following is what I have ended up with. I think the midsquare works not sure though, but only seems to work on large integers.  The folding and truncation definitely are not working. I havent even attempted the radix method.

Negative 938 pDear Stack Overflowers,p  pI feel that my problem must be very common, which makes the fact that Im failing to find a solution all more puzzling. Perhaps my poor searching skills are to blame.p  pIm in charge of maintaining my wifes a hrefhttplivinginthefuture.org relnofollowwebsitea, which mainly consists of online series. The site uses php to generate pages from a MySQL database I guess that would make it dynamically generated. Every time a new episode is added I need to update a couple of pages index and the penultimate episode pages with links and images to point to this new episode. The obvious problem is that cached versions of the website would not have that updated link. That is unless the visitor reloads one of those updated pages. One way to deal with it would be to make those two pages noncacheable, but that seems a bit brutal.p  pI have read several resources on CacheControl, but am still at loss figuring out which parameters would be useful in this particular situation. Since I dont know, when the next episode will be published, I cant use Expires or maxage or can I. Similarly, since I need to reload the whole page, I cant just change the file name, as I could for an image. What I would ideally like to do is to compare the date of the cached version and the lastmodified date of the file and if the cache version is older than the file  force the browser load the new version. But Im open to other approaches.p  pId be equally happy to either modify htaccess file or add the php Header. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.p  pMany thanksp

I also use image variable instead of ssbo in fragment shader or compute shader, only to find memoryBarrier and coherent cant change anything. It just seems that memoryBarrier or coherent doesnt work.p  h1After reading several material, it seems that I know whats happning here, I post my understanding below. If its not true, please correct me.h1  pThe  codememoryBarriercode cant synchronize invocations by synchronizing memory accesses. More specifically, what exactly codememoryBarriercode do is just waiting for completion of all memory accesses strongwhich have already happened in the invocationsstrong. It will not wait for the memory accessing code to finish which have not executed even though its prior to the codememoryBarriercode in the source code. The Opengl programming guide said codeWhen memoryBarrier is called, it ensures that any writes to memory that have been performed by the shader invocation have been committed to memory rather than lingering in caches or being scheduled after the call to memoryBarriercode. Thats means, for example, assuming there are three invocations, if both invocation A and B have runned the imageStore for a codecoherentcode image variable, then a following codememoryBarriercode of A or B will guarantee this imageStore has changed the data in main memory, not just the cache. But if invocation C has not runned imageStore when A or B call codememoryBarriercode, then this codememoryBarriercode call will not wait for C to run its imageStore. So codememoryBarriercode cant help me to implement the algorithm.p
Negative 938 pIm asking this somehow simple question just to be finicky, because sometimes Im worried about a misuse I might be doing of many UIViews APIs, especially when it comes to autolayout.p  pTo make it super simple Ill go with an example, lets assume I need an UIView subclass that has an image icon and a multiline label the behaviour I want is that the height of my view changes with the height of the label to fit the text inside, also, Im laying it out with Interface builder, so I have something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comP5GvC.png altsimple view imagep  pwith some constraints that give fixed width and height to the image view, and fixed width and position relative to the image view to the labelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXsKSt.png altsimple view image, constraints shownp  pNow, if I set  some text to the label, I want the view to be resized in height to fit it properly, or remain with the same height it has in the xib. Before autolayout I would have done always something like thisp  pIn the CustoView subclass file I would have overridden codesizeThatFitscode like sop  precode CGSize sizeThatFitsCGSizesize      this stands for whichever method I would have used     to calculate the height needed to display the text based on the font     CGSize labelSize  [self.titleLabel intrinsicContentSize]      check if were bigger than whats in ib, otherwise resize     CGFloat newHeight  labelSize.height lt 21  51 labelSize.height20      size.height  newHeight      return size   codepre  pAnd than I would have called something likep  precodemyView.titleLabel.text  a big text to display that should be more than a line [myView sizeToFit] codepre  pNow, thinking in constraints, I know that autolayout systems calls codeintrinsicContentSizecode on the view tree elements to know what their size is and make its calculations, therefore I should override codeintrinsicContentSizecode in my subview to return the exact same things it returns in the codesizeThatFitscode method previously shown, except for the fact that, previously, when calling codesizeToFitcode I had my view properly resized, but now with autolayout, in combination with a xib, this is not going to happen.p  pOf course I might be calling codesizeToFitcode every time I edit text in my subclass, along with an overridden codeintrinsicContentSizecode that returns the exact same size of codesizeThatFitscode, but somehow I dont think this is the proper way of doing it.p  pI was thinking about overriding codeneedsUpdateConstraintscode and codeupdateConstraintscode, but still makes not much sense since my views width and height are inferred and translated from autoresizing mask from the xib.p  pSo long, what do you think is the cleanest and most correct way to make exactly what I show here and support fully autolayout p

Negative 938 pSo I have a rather large table 150 million rows that data scrub queries get run on nightly.  Now these queries dont update a lot of records, but to get the records needed, that have to query that single table multiple times in sub queries, which takes some time.p  pSo, would it be better for me to do a normal update statement, or would it be better if I put the few results I needed in a temp table, and then just did an update for those few rows, which would greatly reduce the locks during update.  p  pIm unsure how an update statement locks work when most of the time is spent querying.  If it is going to only update 5 records, and runs for half and hour, will it release a record that it updated in the first minute, or does it wait till the end of the queryp  pThanksp

Negative 938 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma251786842591234This answera brought up the question of how the ellipsis feature in codeRcode handles empty arguments. Apparently an empty argument in code...code works sometimes see codelapplycode version below but not other times see codesapplycode version. Heres the example p  precodelst lt listxmatrix1 lapplylst, [, 1,   x  [1] 1 sapplylst, [, 1,   Error in lapplyX  X, FUN  FUN, ...      argument is missing, with no default codepre  pFrom what I can tell, codesapplycode actually just reuses its code...code arguments when calling codelapplycode. So I dont understand why codelapplycode works but codesapplycode doesnt. Can anybody explain this behavior. p  pIn the codesapplycode help it states that p  blockquote   psapply, simplify  FALSE, USE.NAMES  FALSE is equivalent to lapply.p blockquote  pHowever, I get the same results as above for the followingp  precodelapplylst, [, i1, j sapplylst, [, i1, j, simplifyFALSE, USE.NAMESFALSE codepre  pBy the way, I know that just adding codeTRUEcode would solve the issue in this case, but Im more interested in why there is a difference, not how to solve it. Im actually more surprised that it works for the codelapplycode case than that it doesnt for the codesapplycode one. p

Negative 938 pI have a recursive method in a class that computes some stages doesnt matter what this is. If it notice that the probability of success for a stage is to low, the stage will be delayed by storing it in a queue and the program will look for delayed stage later. It grabs a stage, copies the data for working and deletes the stage.p  pThe program runs fine, but I got a memory problem. Since this program is randomized it could happen that it delays up to 10 million stages which results in something like 8 to 12 GB memory usage or more but it crashes before that happens. It seems the program never frees the memory for a deleted stage before reaching the end of the call stack of the recursive function.p  precodeclass StageWorker  private     queueltStagegt delayedStages      void performStage start              [long valuefromstage  start.value ]         delete start          Do something here          Delay a stage if necessary like this        thisgtdelayedStages.pushnew Stagevalue          Do something more here          Look for delayed stages like this        Stage front  thisgtdelayedStages.front        thisgtdelayedStages.pop        thisgtperformampfront       codepre  pI use pointer to pointer as I thought the memory is not freed, because there is a pointer front that points to the stage. So I used a pointer that point to the pointer, and so I can delete it. But it seems not to work. If I watch the memory usage on Performance monitor on Windows it like like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHgAb3.png altMemory usage with marked end of recursive callsbr I marked the end of the recursive calls. This is also just a example plot. real data, but in a very small scenario.p  pAny ideas how to free the memory of not longer used sages before reaching the end of the call stackp  pstrongEditstrongbr I followed some advice and removed the pointers. So now it looks like thisp  precodeclass StageWorker  private     queueltStagegt delayedStages      void performStageamp start              [long valuefromstage  start.value ]          Do something here          Delay a stage if necessary like this        thisgtdelayedStages.pushStagevalue          Do something more here          Look for delayed stages like this                  thisgtperformthisgtdelayedStages.front        thisgtdelayedStages.pop       codepre  pBut this changed nothing, memory usage is the same as before.p  pAs mentioned it maybe is a problem of monitoring. Is there a better way to check the exact memory usagep
Negative 938 pWhen I run meteor, sometimes I get an error and it hangs on p  blockquote   p Your application has errors. Waiting for file change.p blockquote  pI think Ive let it sit before and it eventually got past that message, but it always takes a long time. What file change is it waiting for Is it npm or meteor And is it slow for others, or is it my Koding box being finicky Can I just stop the process or should I waitp  pI dont need help resolving the error that caused this message in this specific instance, just wondering how to handle meteor errors in general when it hangs on this message and curious as to what it means.p
Negative 938 pI have a series on .png images, which were created by Matlab running image on series on mxn matrices. In doing so, it applied the default colormap jet. I now need to get the data back from the images the data itself was lost. As I understand it, the image function takes my mxn matrix, and a colormap, and uses it to generate an mxnx3 tensor of RGB values. Is it possible aside from just searching through the colormap like a lookup table, to get Matlab to go from the image, and, based on the colormap used to generate it, reconstruct the data.p  pThis can certainly be done, since the mapping from the original data to the RGB values is linear, based on the colormap, but I can only think of using the colormap as a lookup table. Is there a sort of reverseimage functionp  pThanks.p

Negative 938 pim programming an app that should analyze an audiosignal, transform into the frquency area, zero out unwanted frequencies  above 150 Hz and reverse the fft that i got an audiosignal again i can listen to.p  pAfter I managed that, i want to anaylse the filtered peak in its Amplitude. This Im doing because I only want to analyse the BassSignal. The App is meant to work as a little discoStroboskop, reacting on sond inputs.p  pSoo The Problem is, I got it running, it analyses the frequencies with a bin about 43 Hz  1024 Samplingrate.   But if I doe the FFT, it waorks so far to analyse the frequency. But after reverting it with an complexeInverse FFT,  it seems not to work.p  pThe way i programmed the app is likep  ol liestablishing an buffer and readerli liwriting the files into an array, splitting signal in real and imag  partli liCalculating magnitude and frequnencyli liZeroing out unwanted frequencies  write the result in a DIFFERENT ARRAYli liInverse the FFTli liAnalyse the Filtered Signal in DBLevel.li ol  psoo. I dont know what the problem is, maybe the array gets read too early or the hole FFT reversing thing needs too much time to calculate the values.p  pIm asking myself if Im doing it right, meaning reversing the FFT. I looked at the vlaues of audioDataDoubles before the FFT and after the FFT i looked at mAudioBuffer2 where I wrote the transfered FFT in. But i dont get the needed Values between 0 and 32678 to calculate the RMS Decibel Level. i get very often 0.0 before and after 3027 what makes no sense at all., p  pMaybe u could help me to fix the problems im struggling with.p  pALready got so far, but this one is killing me and wasting my time.p  pLet me know what u think about it.

Negative 938 pI have the following use case scenario. I am doing a search with some query terms by aggregating some fields without applying any filters initially. Now lets say the results are 100,000 and I have 50,000 from class A and 50,000 from class B. In the UI if I click the class A button, I want to filter the results and show one the ones that belong to class A. Is this possible without doing a new search. Can I filter the results after the search is done. If yes how I can do it Some java code would be much appreciated.p

So I implemented codetextFieldtextFieldshouldChangeCharactersInRangereplacementStringcode and block attempts which would change the text to something that starts with whitespace. This works as expected.p  pUnfortunately this messes up QuickType. Each time I press space in an empty field, which is then ignored by my textField, the Quicktype text gets prefixed with this space.

Negative 938 pFirst Im going to state my full problem in case the best solution is not the one Im pursuing.p  pI am currently implementing a Django App, where Im using model inheritance. Then Im looking to use different forms for each type, being the only difference the fields that are the ones that each model has, with a generic url the app should detect which type is being requested.p  pFor examplep  precodeclass AModel   pass  class BA   pass  class CA   pass codepre  pThe app is called codeappcode. So, when the user requests codeappeditAid1code, the app should automatically display the correct form depending on if the codeid1code corresponds to a type codeAcode, codeBcode, or codeCcode.p  pRight now I tried something like this. The user requests codeid1code, which is of type codeCcode. Because all the info I get is the codeidcode in the table, I dop  precodea  A.objects.getmyidid1 if a.b  return is B if a.c  return is C return is A codepre  pHowever, this fails with codeRelatedObjectDoesNotExist A has no bcode. So I figure I could handle this with a codetry exceptcode block. This however doesnt seem nice to me, so, is there a better way to do thisp  pThank you.p

Negative 938 pI am implementing a pyqtgraph based ECG display application.p  pIt updates 24 subplots in a grid.

Luke at pyqtgraphs  google groups says that, the extra time is taken for repainting the GUI. p  pI enabled a click handler which maximized a single plot and hides all other plots. Now the timer fires properly. my guess is that as Qt needs less time to repaint a single plot even though its maximized Maybe due to less pixel level changes.p  pSo my question is, how can I optimize or enhance my code so that when I view all the plots together in  the grid view, the plot is updated properly. How can I reduce the repaint time Or is there a better solution p  h2UPDATEh2  pI have profiled my code and you can view it at a hrefhttppastebin.comKPbPkPwr relnofollowthisa pastebin page.p  pI tried disableAutoRange.

Negative 938 pI am making a game in which I have many kinds of soldiers, each kind with their own attributes speed, attackPower.... Obviously, all of them can Walk, Attack... so I thought that creating an abstract class Soldier with those methods, and subclasses with each unit attributes would be the appropiate. The problem is that I cant use the attributes of derived classes in the base one.p  pThe easy way would probably be implementing the methods in the derived classes, but that would mean lots of duplicated code, and I want to avoid it. In fact, this would make the base class unneccesary.p  pI have tried several things. As I understand, the closest solution I tried was using abstractvirtual properties, but again I would be duplicating the get code for each unit type. Maybe this cant be avoided, but Id like to, if possible.p  pThere surely exist a simple solution I havent thought about. Any ideasp  pI think about somethink like thisp  precodepublic abstract class Soldier       public int AttackPower          get  return this.power            public Attack          Console.WriteLineAttacked with AttackPower attack power        public class LancerSoldier       int power5   public class ArcherSoldier       int power10  codepre  pOf course, this is not a correct solution, because the Soldier class doesnt know about the power variable, but if I declare the power variable in the Soldier class, I get an error because the field name is duplicated.p  pAny help will be appreciated.p

I know if I wanted to have just an imagine, I could put it in a div between the navbar and footer and set play around with codeheight100 widthautocode so that it resizes with the browser although this doesnt work perfectly without some modifications but I dont know how to do this if I have codebody  backgroundimage url... code I have a large resolution picture in there right now, and on a 1080 screen it doesnt scale down, it just shows 1080px of the original imagine. Is there anything in Bootstrap or CSS tricks I can use This might be trivial to some but I am new to this, just finished Codecademy courses which introduced me to Bootstrap and now Im trying some stuff on my own.p  pSo to recap I want to have 169 ratio of a large picture, if the browser becomes to narrow, I want the height to stay the same and start cutting off the leftright sides of the image so that the center of the image is still in the center of the browser. Likewise for vice versa. the codeheight100 widthautocode doesnt quite work because if the ratio is wrong, it stretches the image. p  pI also want to have a different picture if the website is accessed from a screenreader, but thats a project for another day. Let me know if I need to clarify anything, and thanks in advancep

Negative 938 pIm trying to plot points on a graph given the X and Y coordinates of a single point. X and Y will both be integers between 1 and 9 inclusive, and the graph should have each axis of size 9.

Negative 938 pIm creating a signup form in Angular with three inputs codeemailcode, codepasswordcode and codepasswordConfirmcode.

If a code422code response comes back which means validation errors, I loop through them and set the corresponding inputs to invalid based on what the API returned.p  pLets take the example of an email address already being registered. I show the validation error in my view like thisp  precodeltsmall classerror ngshowsignupForm.email.error.existsgtEmail address taken, please use anotherltsmallgt codepre  pThis all works perfectly, but my user is now stuck because when they try to change the email address to another one, the validity of the codeemailcode field isnt changed to allow them to resubmit the form I disable the submit button based on form validity.p  pBasically, I need the validation property in this case codeexistscode to be reset to codetruecode after the user changes the input model. Whats the best way for me to do thatp  pstrongEditstrong A small brainwave hit me after posting, I added this to my controllerp  precodescope.watchuser.email, function       Reset exists validation property back to true     scope.signupForm.email.setValidityexists, true  codepre  pwhich seems to work. When the user changes the model value after the input was set to invalid, this sets it back to valid. But this doesnt strike me as the best way to do this. Anyone know betterp

Negative 938 pHello I am designing my NVC web application and have different namespaces. Currently I have a namespace for the Repository object definition for the code first generation of the database, the DTOs objects that will be used for transferring data from the application to the database and the Models which will be responsible for showing stuff such as SelectLists for the client. The way it should flow is p  pThe client submits a Model  this gets mapped to a DTO in the controller  the DTO is sent to a manager class which is responsible for DB access   this gets mapped into a Repository class object and saved in the DB.p  pThe Repository classes are data annotated with the different constraints in my DB, such as Key or Primary Key, MaxLength, etc. On the other hand, my Model classes are annotated for data validation wich attributes such as String Length, etcp  pHowever, the issue here is that many times, the information that the user needs to fill in, i.e. the Models have a lot of common information with the Repository classes. What I would like to do is to have some sort of dynamic class definition which allows me to set the data annotations to the class depending on the namespace where it is located without needing to repeat the class definition. p  pan example of what I want to dop  precodenamespace Repository     [MetadataTypetypeofMyClassRepositoryMetadata]     public partial class MyClass        public int MyClassId get set        public string SomeProperty get set        namespace Model     [MetadataTypetypeofMyClassModelMetadata]     public partial class MyClass              codepre  pIs this possible Maybe there is another way or design methodology to reuse the repository classes  for data validation in the client sidep

Negative 938 pI created a program to read serial data from a COM port using C, however due to changes in my project I have to read data from a BT port.

Negative 938 pIm implemeting an SSO login feature for an application. Problem is that tomcat server need to be installed on linux or windows  so i cannt use waffle.

Negative 938 pI cant figure out how to get my DbContext to refresh or requery the database, even after restarting Visual Studio.p  pIm using EF 6.0 database first approach. This means I have an edmx file with a class inheriting from DbContext MyContext in my case. I instantiate it like any other class  codemyContext  new MyContextcodep  pThe problem is that if I modify data in the database while the program is running the context is never refreshed so it holds on to the stale data. No problem... just stop the program from running and start it up again. Nope, the stale data is still there. After about an hour of stopping and restarting Visual Studio and much debugging it finally realizes the data is stale and refreshes.p  pMy question is 1 how is this possible considering I stopped the program from running and 2 how can I make sure that every time the application starts it grabs a fresh set of datap
Negative 938 pI know that this question has been asked several times before and there have been a variety of answers ranging fromp  ol liUse the intent to pass primitive data types.li liImplementing the strongSerializablestrong or strongParseablestrong interface and handling the serialization and deserialization in the appropriate methods. This way, it can be passed as an parameter in the intent.li liPersisting data in strongSharedPreferencesstrong  again only supports primitive data types.li liSaving the object as a part of the strongApplicationstrong object  basically a Singleton class. I dont like this method as the application might get killed and the data would not persist.li ol  pIm writing a crossplatform application and I have ViewModels MVVM architecture that need to be passed around. strongSolution 4strong works for me but I want to ensure that I will have data which is not dependent on the application lifecycle. I cannot implement Serializable or Parseable as the ViewModel consists of some objects that do not have serialization support Reactive Extensions  which rules out the other solutions.p  pIs there a better solution out there that I can usep

Negative 938 pIve implemented OneDrive into my Universal App and it seems to work but I struggle about how to sync files between devices. p  pLets say I got save, stats and current game state files separately. They are not big but greater than 100Kb so I cans use roaming folder. I was thinking about using roaming settings so if there are changes I just check the value of it date and time e.g. the last change was made and if it differs then just display a notification that user should synchronize his files MS requirement is that you cant automatically sync files with OneDrive  user must click sync button. And what if roaming settings were removed after 30 days intervalp  pIs this the best solution or I should not use OneDrive I dont have any web service and I dont think I have time to learn how to make one properly but if it isnt that hard I might try and abandon OneDrive. I think Using roaming settings is good idea. Set one to notify if there were changes and one local to preserve previous value and few more to notify which files were changed.p  pEDIT I changed the way I do it and now there is no need to check which files are the newest I check the content and join them together but still there is one thing to do. How to sync files with OneDrive within OnSuspending method that it still will upload them even if App will suspend I got 5 seconds, right. Or just this method  emCreateBackgroundUploadAsyncem is taking care of everything and I shouldnt bother myself with this.p

Negative 938 h2THE GOALh2  pI implemented a longrunning CUDA kernel that writes results to a pagelocked host memory queue a la p  precode SAMPLE KERNEL CODE int result  ... queue[atomicIncatomicresultcounter]  result codepre  pAs I dont want to wait for the kernel execution to be completed, but rather try to process results as soon as theyre written, I decided to introduce two CUDA streams p  ol liStream 1 Execute kernel that is writing out the results aforementionedli liStream 2 Repeatedly poll the device side codeatomicresultcountercode and check how many results can currently be expected. li ol  h2THE CATCHh2  pThe problem is that the codeatomicresultcountercode gives only an indication of how many results can be expected, but theyre not necessarily available yet but may still need to be written.p  h2POSSIBLE APPROACHESh2  h2Bitmap Index for written resultsh2  pIntroduce a bitmap index and set a bit once the according result has been written. strongWorks but slow.strongp  precode MODIFIED SAMPLE KERNEL CODE unsigned int ridx  atomicIncatomicresultcounter queue[ridx]  result threadfencesystem setBitampresultbitmapindex, ridx codepre  h2Init queue with 0 and check if value is different from 0h2  pBefore starting the kernel execution Id init all the bytes in the queue with 0 and then, during the kernel execution on the host side, Id iterate over the results that potentially could already be available. And, to make sure that the result has already been written, Id check if the value is different from 0 as 0 is no valid result. strongMy concern amp key questionstrong A result is an int 4 byte long. Even if wed neglect the fact that were using pagelocked memory, I am afraid that I might run into a situation where only the first 2 byte of the result have been written to device memory, therefore yielding a nonzero value, but not yet the final result. Can that happen E.g. that the result would be 0xc004c003, but in global memory only 0xc0040000 has been written so farp  h2Somehow observe the queues memory on the hosth2  pI really dont know if thats possible and how, but if I could observe the queues memory or get notified by the driver when the kernel has written some data to the pagelocked memory.

Negative 938 pIm trying to implement basic pathfinding to my tile editor program. This is the first time Im trying to implement pathfinding so I found it most easy to stick with the depth first search algorithm, because I found a great example of how to use that algorithm on the internet. p  pI have managed to find the path from one tile to an another tile. The problem is that the program run extremely slow when it try to check which tiles whos walkable and whos not. p  pIn the code example that I have used as a starting point, the guy who wrote it have used recursion, and the performance drops drastically. p  precodeint pathFindingdfsint x, int y, vectorltpairltint, intgt gt path    ifpath.size gt maxsize     cout ltlt Returning  path size too big ltlt endl     return 0       ifx lt 0  x gt TILESX  y lt 0  y gt TILESY        cout ltlt Returning  bounds ltlt endl     return 0       ifmap[y][x]  blockedTile        cout ltlt Returning  blocked ltlt endl     return 0       ifvisited[y][x]        cout ltlt Returning  visited ltlt endl     if tileMap[x][y]  3              tileMap[x][y]  5          return 0       visited[y][x]  true    cout ltlt Visiting  ltlt x ltlt   ltlt y ltlt endl    path.pushbackmakepairx, y    ifmap[y][x]  goalTile        finalpath  path     visited[y][x]  false     return 0       I think the problem lies here   dfsx, y  1, path   dfsx  1, y, path   dfsx, y  1, path   dfsx  1, y, path    visited[y][x]  false    return 0  codepre  pI would also like to know how I can move the sprite after I have found the path. I have stored the coordinates in the vector finalpath, but how can I move the sprite so it moves smooth step for step until the sprite reach its destinationp  pbtw sorry for bad English p
