Positive 991 pIm building in scheme a database using a wiredtiger keyvalue store. p  pTo query a given table one needs to have a codecursorcode over the table.

Instead its preferable to keep a set of cursors ready to be used and when one can emrequestem via codedb.cursorcode this will remove a cursor from the available cursors and return it. Once the context operation is finished, put it back.p  pThe way I solve this in Python is by using a codelistcode. codedb.cursorcode looks likep  precodedef cursorself     cursor  self.cursors.pop     yield cursor     self.cursors.appendcursor codepre  pWhich means, retrieve a cursor, send it to the current context, once the context is finished, put it back to the list of available cursors.p  pHow can I avoid the mutation and use more functional approachp

Positive 991 pI need some help understanding the syntax on how to append a number into a list, im doing this from user input via the console so this elements have to be entered in recursively.

Positive 991 pThere are lots of delightful opinions about macros in Lisp, but I really cannot find a primer I can use in my every day workflow. Im web developer, but use emacs for about 10 years. And I want to understand if macros are really useful for everyone, or it is just killer feature for very specific tasks.p  pMost of the primers using macros are tryings of making DSL on top of the lisp. Well it can be useful sometimes, but creating syntax extensions in commercial development is a bad practice as far as I understand. Most of languages has standard features like for, if, while, foreach operators, common conceptions like classes, namespaces, modules, closureslambdas. So all programs are typically built from such pieces, and new programmer examining your code already knows that pieces and can operate them. And in case of DSL built upon macros, the programmer needs not only to explore business logic, but also learn your DSL. Commercial development gravities to typical solutions with easy support and high replaceability of programmers.p  pNext  creating template engines on top of the macros. Well, the industry standard now is Twig, Jinja2, Template Toolkit  you can create your own template system, but... It is 2015 now, not 2001 when Paul Grahams Viaweb was created. Modern templating systems are very similar to each other  they was developed for years and they have lots of conceptions like blocks, filters, inheritance, i18n. So in 2001 creating own templating engine had sense, but now there complex templating engines for all suddens of life.p  pNext  using macros to create algorithms independent on data passed to them. This conception makes sense, but does it really need macros For example most of scripting languages support of passing functions by reference  that means you can create abstract function which will accept data and dataprocessing function as arguments. Of course you will need to create few dataprocessing functions to support all needed data types, but you will be able to pass all those ones to abstract function which will be short as comparable lisp macro.p  pNext  algorithms itself. Nowadays 90 of us, webdevelopers, are just using ready libraries and algorithms. So even if Im totally wrong in previous paragraph, the role of macros is very small in our job.p  pSo do you really use macros everyday, or you just arely shoot some problem with macros very elegantly and extrapolate that hapinees on next few monthesp

Negative 991 pIm thinking I need a browser plugin that does the following, and if it doesnt exist, it should.  I may as well say FF for now, but it could be any browser.p  pThe problem when moving a website from one server to another, you need migration testing.  It is a pain to click on every link by hand and compare it to the old host.  You really need 2 machines or have to constantly thrash your hosts file.p  pThe pluginp  pWould allow you to specify an alternate hosts entry for a website.  2 entries would make it clear, one for live, one for test.p  pThe plugin would crawl every link on the site, and render the page in the browser, and save an image of the entire page.p  pIt would switch hosts and repeat, and save images in a second folder.  Since the rendering engines match, the images should match.  We need to switch hosts like etchosts so all absolute links are the same for the site.p  pNow this could be part of the plugin or external, now that we have 2 folders of identically named images, we run an imagediff program on the whole batch.  A quick test would be a bdiff or hash, or we could get more sophisticated and determine emhowem different each image is.p  pThis would save so much time.  So can it be done with existing tools, or do I need to go write itp
Negative 991 pIm having a sort out of my Delphi applications and I been visiting the floating form size and location persistence which seems to be increasingly important with larger screen realestate and multimonitors. Clearly it is often desireable to have a users form reopen in the same place as they closed it, but maybe not always, for example a modal dialog might justify opening bang in front of the users vision, i.e on the primary monitor center screen. There seems to be little out there on the net about this and commercial applications seem inconsistent especially regarding multiple monitors. So, a few probably contravertial rules to get us started...p  ul liNonmodal forms should always reopen at the size and location of closure.li liModal forms i.e with OKcancel, YesNo buttons should reopen at the previous size if sizeable, but inthe center of the monitor on which the application resides.li liAn information message box should open in the center of the monitor on which the application resides.li liA warning or error dialog should open in the center of the primary monitor.li ul  pThanks in advance, Brianp

Since expressions are evaluated at runtime, all the legal combinations of source types and function argument types that might need to be used in an expression have to be anticipated ahead of time and precompiled in the library so that theyll be usable at runtime.  If I miss a legal combination, some reasonable expressions wont work in runtime expressions if I accidently generate a combination that isnt legal C, my library just wont compile.p  pEdit narrowing the questionp  pThanks, all of your answers are actually pretty helpful.  I knew the answer was complicated, but it sounds like Ive only seen the tip of the iceberg.p  pLet me rephrase the question a little then to limit its scope then I will let the user specify a list of BaseClasses and a list of UserDefinedConversions.

Negative 991 pI would like to give sources for what Im saying but I just dont have them, its something I heard.p  pOnce a programming professor told me that some software benchmarking done to .net vs Python in some particular items it gave a relation of 58 in favor of .NET . That was his argument in favor of Python not being so much slower than .NETp  pHere its the thing, I would like to try IronPython since I could combine the web framework I know the most asp.net with the language I like the most Python and I was wondering about the speed of programs in asp.net in Python vs the speed of programs in ASP.NET with VB.net or C. Is there any software benchmarking on this p  pAlso, shouldnt the speeds of IronPython compared to other .NET languages be similar, since IronPython unlike Python have to compile to the .NET intermediate code Can someone enlight me on these issuesp  pGreetingsp

Negative 991 pI am working without expression blend and just using the XAML editor in vs2010. The wisdom of this aside, I am increasingly seeing a need for designtime data binding. For simple cases, the codeFallbackValuecode property works very nicely Textboxes and TextBlocks, etc. But especially when dealing with codeItemsControlcode and the like, one really needs sample data to be visible in the designer so that you can adjust and tweak controls and data templates without having to run the executable. p  pI know that codeObjectDataProvidercode allows for binding to a type, and thus can provide designtime data for visualizing, but then there is some juggling to allow for the real, runtime data to bind without wasting resources by loading loading both the design time, dummied data and the runtime bindings. p  pReally what I am wanting is the ability to have, say, John, Paul, George, and Ringo show up in the XAML designer as stylable items in my codeItemsControlcode, but have real data show up when the application runs.p  pI also know that Blend allows for some fancy attributes that define design time binding data that are effectively ignored by WPF in runtime conditions. p  pSo my questions arep  pstrong1. How might I leverage designtime bindings of collections and nontrivial data in the visual studio XAML designer and then swap to runtime bindings smoothlystrongp  pstrong2. How have others solved this designtime vs. runtime data problemstrong In my case, i cannot very easily use the same data for both as one would be able to with, say, a database query.p  pstrong3. Are their alternatives to expression blend that i could use for dataintegrated XAML designstrong I know there are some alternatives, but I specifically want something I can use and see bound sample data, etcp

Negative 991 pIve made a compiler for a generalpurpose programming language. As part of the toolchain, Id like to include a profiler with the ability to estimate the time complexity of a given expression. It seems fairly straightforward to calculate the emalgorithmicem complexitymdashthat is, assuming all constanttime operations take the same amount of timemdashbut Id like to be able to approximate the emrealem complexity as well. To do that, I need information on the relative performance of individual processor operations such as codeinccode, codeaddcode, codemulcode, etc., as well as certain higherlevel operations such as IO.p  pI realise this is both architecture and implementationdependent, may yield only fuzzy results at best, emandem is something of a dual question. But does anyone happen to know of any highquality resources available to get me started Would looking at opensource implementations of higherlevel operations give me enough information to provide a fair estimate of their complexitiesp
Negative 991 pWere developing a new eCommerce website and are using NHibernate for the first time.  At present we are splitting our data into multiple SQL Server databases, divided per area of functionality.  So we have one for UserInfo, one for Orders, one for ProductCatalogue and so on...p  pOur justification for this decision is twofold reallyp  ol lipthe website has the potential to be HUGE it is a new website for one of the largest online brands in the UK and we feel that by partitioning our data along functional lines we will be able to move the databases onto their own servers which would give us an easy scaling route should we need itpli lipmy team has always worked this way  partly as a consequence of following the MS Commerce Server pattern from previous projects.pli ol  pHowever, reading up on this decision on the internet, we find that the normal response to this sort of model is extremely scathing.  Creating more work for the devs now in order to create more work for the devs later is one sample comment from Stack Overflowp  pIn addition, NHibernate is much easier to use with only one database just one SessionFactory needed.  And knowing that Stack Overflow ran off just one box for a long time makes me think that maybe we should not try to be so clever.p  pSo, my question is, are we correct in thinking that using finegrained databases might increase our ability to scale or should we sacrifice this for easier developmentp

Negative 991 pI have a rather large set of integration tests developed in CNUnit. Currently it is one test fixture, one class. In [TestFixtureSetUp] I create a database from a script and populate it with test data, also from a script.

Negative 991 pIm am designing my databasedomain for an eCommerce application and Im having a hard time figuring out how to store products.p  pThe website will sell a wide range of products, pens, thongs, tattoos, umbrellas, everything. Each of these product will share a few common attributes, height, width, length, weight, etc but some products have special data. For example, pens have different ink colors and tipslids and brochures can have different types of folds. So far I have thought up some 20 extra attributes, but these attributes may only apply to 1 of products on the website.p  pSo I am wondering if it is appropriate to implement a EAV model to handle the extra data. Keeping in mind that when customers are viewing the site in the frontend, there will be a filtering sidebar like on eBay and carsales.com.au. So keeping in mind there will be a fair bit of queryingp  pI dont think its practical to implement Class Table inheritance as the system needs to remain flexible. This is because, down the track we may have more attributes in the future with new types of products.p  pThe other thing I have considered is using a NoSQL database probably MongoDB however I have little experience with these types of databases, will it even solve my problemp  pReview of optionsp  ol liSingle products entity with lots of columnsli liSeparate attributes entity EAVli liSwitch to schemaless persistence li ol  pIm in the process of building a prototype with an attributes entity to see how flexible it is, and testing the performance and how out of control the querying gets.p  pEDIT I am, of course, open to any other solutions.p

Negative 991 pI am new to programming in general. Im writing a program that takes a command line argument and a input string once started. It can convert to pig latin, undo the pig latin, or do rot13.p  pI have all of my functions working flawlessly but I need help parsing the input string as all the functions can only do one word at a time and it can only contain letters. Any word with a delimiter in it has to be treated as two words, such as no0b would be treated as no0b with the zero not going into the function.p  pMy understanding of how this would work would be to have a output string and add the words to it as they are done then add the delimiters and then the next word and so on. This could be done with a loop, but could someone help me figure out how to break the input string into words and then move the delimiters Thanks in advance. p

Negative 991 pWe have a thirdparty vendor setting up software on a server.  They have full access to that server and the sqlserver on it with the sa account.  We would like to set up a linked server so that a trigger can update data on a remote machine.  Does access to the sa account necessarily mean that they have full access to the linked server or is there a way to protect yourself from sap  pEDIT We wanted to give them full control of the server because we want them to have full responsibility.  It takes the blame off us when it stops working. hey, we didnt touch it, you fix it, you have full permissions.  That way, they can do whatever they need to to get their software working, but its in a sand boxed environment.  We just need a trigger to get the final records out of their database and insert into our production database.  That requires permissions we dont want to give them.  The question was meant to ask if there was a way to save the password in that sand boxed environment under there noses. so to speak.p

Negative 991 pIve been working with a custom ExpandableList see example picture below where each item always has one child. This child consists of three parts. Each part has a header red bars and below that an Empty item OR a list of items. The length of this list will vary.p  pThe first way I tried to do this is by adding a ViewStub below the empty item, which I inflated with a custom view, which also contained a ViewStub at the end which I inflated in turn for the next item, thus adding items recursively to create this sort of list of items. Sadly this resulted in StackOverflowErrors when the list became too long With short lists this worked perfectly.p  pSo on my second try I tried using a ListView with a custom adapter instead. Sadly this list only used a small part of my screen and the rest of the items where occluded behind the header of the next part This mini list looked scrollable as a second scrollbar appeared next to it, but it did not scroll. Not that I would consider this scrolling inside a scrolling list to be a good solution, but just wanted to mention this.p  pCan anyone tell me how I can tell this list of items to not be scrollable and take up all the room that it needs does it know what size it is going to be when the child node is created or help me with a alternative solution to my problem Ooh, and I have considered putting an unholy amount of ViewStubs inside my layout, but that just seems idiotic and really bad practice.

Negative 991 pHere is some background to the problem. We are working with an EyeVis wall setup, see this link a hrefhttpwww.eyevis.co.uk relnofollowhttpwww.eyevis.co.ukap  pThe EyeVis wall can have any number of windows displayed on the wall at any time. We query the wall for its size dimensions, and then query it for a list of all the windows currently being displayed on the wall. This comes back as a set of coordinates as followsp  blockquote   pLeft, Top, Width, Heightp blockquote  pSo at this stage we have the size of the wall, and the coordinates of each window being displayed within that wall.  What we need to do is display a representation of the walls layout on a monitor being viewed by the controller. The controller will then select one of the windows from the monitor and this window will be enlarged on the EyeVis wall.p  pI have tried a few things, in the hope that there might be a simple way to achieve this. One idea I had was this p  ol liCreate a panel in code with the dimensions of the wall. li liAdd each window to this panel using the coordinates.li liAdd the main panel to a form and dock the panelli ol  pI thought this would auto scale all the panels within the main panel and we would see the layout, but docking at runtime doesnt seem to behave the way I imagined p  pThis is the code I had Using Cp  precodePanel mainPanel  new Panel  mainPanel.Width  eyeVisWallWidth mainPanel.Height  eyeVisWallHeight  foreach Window thisWindow in windowList      Panel newWindow  new Panel      newWindow.Top  thisWindow.windowTop     newWindow.Width  thisWindow.windowWidth     newWindow.Height  thisWindow.windowHeight     newWindow.Left  thisWindow.windowLeft      Label newLabel  new Label     newLabel.Text  thisWindow.windowID.ToString    newWindow.Height    newWindow.Width     newWindow.Controls.AddnewLabel     newWindow.BorderStyle  BorderStyle.FixedSingle      mainPanel.Controls.AddnewWindow   this.panel1.Controls.AddmainPanel  mainPanel.Dock  DockStyle.Fill mainPanel.Anchor  AnchorStyles.None codepre  pSo now Im starting to think this might have to be solved with math, which is really not my strong point.

Negative 991 pSo I have an interesting situation.  Ive inherited a big mess of code where the original developer decided to forego using inheritance in favor of enums and switch statements...its a perfect example of a hrefhttpc2.comcgiwikiSwitchStatementsSmell relnofollowthis antipatterna  Now its time to refactor, and Ive decided the best way to go about it is to pull out a superclass backed by a table with shared columns and then use the joined subclass inheritance strategy.  So far so good...p  pNow the tricky part is that this code has already been deployed to a production system.  Accordingly, my refactored code has to be backwardscompatible with the schemadata out there, and I cant start dropping redundant columns off of the subclass tables until one release in the future.  Like it or not, Im going to have duplicated columns between the parent and child tables for one release cycle.p  pLuckily for me, hibernate doesnt flip out when it sees that there are duplicate columns between parent and child tables.  But the bad news is that it doesnt update said duplicated columns in both tables.  The column in the parent table gets updated, but the one in the child is left stale.p  pFor backwardcompatibility with the current code, Id like for the column to be updated in both tables.  That way, updates to the entities arent lost if we have to rollback the release and go back to the old schema.  While I know that I could take care of this via triggers, Im looking for a codeonly solution because triggers have a nasty habit of flying under the radar.p  pIs there anyone out there who can tell me a way to convince hibernate to hit both columnsp  pA very contrived example of my classes isp  precodeEntity Tablename  superclass Inheritancestrategy  InheritanceType.JOINED public class SuperClass       Id Generated     Long id     boolean duplicate   Entity Tablename  subclass public class SubClass extends SuperClass      String otherProperty  codepre  pWith the tables to matchp  precodeCREATE TABLE superclass      id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,     duplicate BOOLEAN   CREATE TABLE subclass      id INT NOT NULL,     duplicate BOOLEAN,     otherProperty VARCHAR255,     FOREIGN KEY id REFERENCES superclassid  codepre  pWhen inserting a new SubClass entity, the duplicate column on the subclass table will be NULL.p  pThanks a bunchp

Negative 991 pThanks in advance. This problem has killed one whole day of my time. Intellisense in Visual Studio 2010 works on all projects in my solution except one.

Negative 991 pIs there anything wrong or unhealthy about creating a subview of the view controllers view, assigning it to an IBOutlet UIView  of the viewcontroller, and then placing on that subview a label that is attached to the IBOutlet UILabel  of another subview of the view controller That is, the label is property in a custom view class, which also appears on screen, but that custom view is a different view than the view that contains the label from the custom class. Make sensep  pIt seems to work, but it seems a bit strange and Im wondering if in fact it is a good idea.p
Negative 991 pI exported a runnable .jar file for a project of mine in Eclipse, but I cant seem to execute it with a double click. Running it from the command line with java jar program.jar works fine, and while I could just leave a batch file to run it, it is rather annoying to do so. And double clicking some older jars that ive exported from Eclipse works fine. Anyone know how to fix this Im running windows 7 x64 btwBut i have 32bit javap  pEDIT Ignore this question completely. It was a problem of me using 64 bit java in 32 bit eclipse, and the workarounds i may have used. Once I changed to 32 bit java, everything was fixed.p

Negative 991 pIve just been playing with jQuery for a little while  been using YUI for awhile and while I really appreciate a lot of what the jQuery library has to offer, Im finding it to be quite a pain to step through jQuery code in the debugger and Im wondering if there are any tricks other than the obvious thingsp  pTake a simple function like thisp  precodefunction findFirstShortChildparent      var result  null       parent   li.eachfunction          if this.cssheight lt 10              result  this             returnfalse     break out of each function                   returnresult  codepre  pIf the function isnt working as intended and I decide I want to step through it, it is not intuitive at all.  In fact, you cant really step through it at all.  You would have to go through all sorts of jQuery code in a bunch of places.  You cant step into the code.eachcode loop because it isnt actually a traditional loop.  Im surprised at how unproductive I feel in the debugger compared to other libraries.  So, here are my issuesp  ul liYou cant step through line by line or youll end up in a whole bunch of jQuery functions.li liYou cant get into the inside of the each loop without either going through a lot of jQuery stuff or setting a breakpoint and letting it hit the breakpoint.li liYou cant see what any of the intermediate values like this are or why it might be getting a bogus value for the height without stepping through miles of foreign jQuery code.li liYou cant break out of the each loop like you do in a traditional loop with break or return because it isnt an actual loop.  The loop is inside the .each function.  What looks like a loop here is just the internals of a function call.li liWhat if I want to know why Im getting a bogus height value in the loop.  Is there any way to figure that out without stepping through a lot of jQuery codeli ul  pSo, what am I missing here  Is it just a lot less convenient to step through this kind of code  Am I missing some magic techniques built into the jQuery framework to help with this  Or is the price you pay for using this style library that you have to completely change how you debug problems.  p  pIs this what you have to dop  ul liAssign intermediate values to local variables in a trouble spot so you can more easily inspect them without stepping through jQuery functions.li liMove from breakpoint to breakpoint rather than stepping through things a line at a time.li liLearn how to step into and through jQuery calls efficiently to answer some kinds of questions.li ul  pHow do you all do it  What am I missingp  pI should mention that I use Firebug in FF5 and the builtin debugger in Chrome Chrome more often than Firebug now.  And, yes Im using the debug nonminified version of jQuery when debugging.  So, this isnt a question about which debugger you use, but how you use the debugger to effectively step through jQuery code.p

Negative 991 pA question regarding inapp purchase autorenewing subscriptionsp  pIm unclear how to handle the case where a user purchases multiple subscriptions of differing durations.  It seems that Apple will recognize if the user has already purchased a given SKU based on productid and prevent repurchasing my app gets a failedtransaction event in this case, but if I offer the same content using different productids having different durations, then the user can potentially purchase twice or more.  p  pEven if I hide the additional purchase options once the user has subscribed once, they could potentially buy another subscription on an alternate device, and that purchase wouldcould ultimately be restored to the other device already having a subscription.p  pAm I supposed to track purchased subscriptions by transactionID and productID, and calculate an ultimate expiration date  That seems complicated.p

Negative 991 pI am developing a lightweight protection mechanism on FMS. Currently, I can authenticate user using SSO Token provided by main server. However, authenticating SSO Token requires WebServiceRemoteObject of another server, which is expensive and unrealistic for large number of concurrent users.

An imposter can use that session ID to get my stream, if he successfully sniffed my customers request. To prevent this, I have two solutions First, every client will create two connections to server, one SSL for control message e.g. NetConnection.call function, one for streaming data. The other is creating a secured RTMPE channel to get the stream. Both require more processing power to implement 15 more for the latter, dont know how much is the former.p  pIs there any better solution for my problemp

Negative 991 pI have a problem calling a Javascript function that was inserted into a codeltdivgtcode via the innerHTML property. I have searched through similar threads in SO, but I wasnt able to find a solution to this problem.p  pIn a simplified version, here is what I havebRp  h2strongMainPage.phpstrongh2  precode ... Basic Headers  ltdiv id  listgt     include filelist.tpl ltdivgt  More stuff... ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function callbackFunctiondata          list.innerHTML  data.updatedListHTML         updateCalculatedFields           Perform a Ajax POST Request with the callbackFunction ltscriptgt codepre  h2strongList.tplstrongh2  precodeif thereIsData      Create a table, populate its content...     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         function updateCalculatedFields                Change some of the values in the created table...              ltscriptgt if codepre  pWith the code above, I get a ReferenceError in the codecallbackFunctiondatacode while trying to call the codeupdateCalculatedFieldscode function. I have doublechecked to see that the innerHTML has been properly updated, the codeupdateCalculatedFieldscode function and the whole script tag has been added to the div. However, Javascript cannot seem to find injected function.p  pWith a small change, the functionality works. If the list.tpl were to be changed top  h2strongList.tpl version 2strongh2  precodeif thereIsData      Create a table, populate its content... if ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function updateCalculatedFields            Change some of the values in the created table...      ltscriptgt codepre  pThe different between the two scenarios is that in the second one, the codeupdateCalculatedFieldscode function is loaded with the page right from the start. In the first one, it gets added later with the innerHTML. So, my conclusion is that Javascript will not register functions that get added via innerHTML. I highly doubt that this is the case though so it would be great if someone could give an explanation on this issue.p

Negative 991 pThis is driving me absolutely insane. I am building a very customized slider jQuery plugin for a project. One of my requirements is that users must be able to deep link into a specific slide. So naturally all of my slides have hash tags and the navigation links have corresponding hashtags. My problem is that the default functionality of the hash tag links are firing on top of my sliding animation triggered by javascript. That is, instead of sliding to slide 4 it jumps immediately to slide 4 and then animates to slide 8. This is despite using every trick I can think of to prevent the default functionality. Here is the snippet of code in question.p  precodeslider.nav.bind click, functionevent      event.preventDefault     if this.hasClassactive           var target  slider.nav.index this          slider.animate target        codepre  pAs you can see here I have used event.preventDefault. I have also tried returning false. No luck whatsoever. Any ideasp

However, I dont want the user to print the page again. I tried setting the print link to a negative zindex using jquery after its being clicked, but the user can refresh the page and reuse the link so it would print again. I also know that I can somehow disable the refresh feature, by modifying what F5 does, but that wouldt save the day since the user can refresh the page through the url bar, and I cant removehide, it as much as I know. It also runs on localhost so the user client and server are on the same side. Even the browser doesnt matter since I could use the one that fits this case.p

Negative 991 pI am trying to establish my own OAuth2 based service using rails. After searching the gems in the rails, I realized I still dont understand OAuth2s workflow of client authorization upon a protected userspecific resource.p  pThe following is my scenariop  ol lipI have a client application consumer registered in the provider site.pli lipThe client application obtains the credential of a provider user user A and sends the token access request to the provider.pli lipThe client successfully obtains the returned access token from the provider.pli ol  pNow, my question is, the access token allows the client application to visit protected resource on the provider. But then how to define the term PROTECTED Is this accesstoken user specific I suppose it should, because if another user B is using client as well, the client application should repeat above workflow with the provider again. I mean, if there are X users using client application with their own profile data on the provider, then the client application should have X access tokens upon the provider, am I rightp  pBut, I didnt find the userspecific protected resource access behavior being defined in the OAuth2 protocol, the only thing I found in chapter 7 Accessing Protected Resources isp  pemThe client accesses protected resources by presenting the access token to the resource server. The resource server MUST validate the access token and ensure it has not expired and that its scope covers the requested resource. The methods used by the resource server to validate the access token as well as any error responses are beyond the scope of this specification, but generally involve an interaction or coordination between the resource server and the authorization server.emp  pThen, does it mean that my application should handle such a problem in my own logicp  pThe last question, for the rails developers, is there any gem covering this topicp

Negative 991 pI am new to rails, but not to programming or databases.  p  pA BETTER PHRASING OF MY QUESTION IS IN MY ANSWER BELOW.p  pFor simplicity in this example, I have 3 models     User     Subscription     DefaultSubscriptionp  precodeUser hasmany Subscriptions Subscription belongsto User  DefaultSubscription hasmany Subscriptions Subscription belongsto DefaultSubscription codepre  pDefaultSubscription is a prepopulated table with certain types of subscriptions.p  pDuring the subscription process, the default subscriptions are listed at one point, and there is a quantity box alongside each one.p  pThe user enters the quantities for each subscription and hits submit to continue on.p  pbMy question is How would one go about creating a new subscription for each quantity in a number formbp  pSo you would have a list something like sop  precodeltolgt    lt each subscription with quantity box gt ltolgt  lt buttonto gt codepre  pWhen the user hits the button, how do you add up the quantity from each box and add a new subscription for each one  Do I have to use javascript to get the numbers  Do I somehow use rails forms even though this quantities are not associated with any specific database field  Any recommendations or pointing me in the right direction to figure this out on my own would be great.  p  pThis form box IS NOT A FIELD FOR ANY MODEL, its a count for an association. Let me rephrase Each quantity in the form boxes represent the number of NEW Subscriptions to be created. Each of these subscriptions BELONGSTO 1 DEFAULTSUBSCRIPTION. In essence, the number represents the number of new subscriptions ASSOCIATED WITH THAT DEFAULT SUBSCRIPTION.p  pIm using rails 3.2.1, and ruby 1.8.7p  pThank youp

Negative 991 pI am having trouble implementing a python algorithm which does the following This is part of an attempt to implement a friend of friend algorithmp  pGiven a list of the form [[a,b],[c,d],[e,f],...] I want to create a new list of the form [[a, a1,a2,a3,...], [b, b1,b2,b3,...], [c, c1,c2,c3,...],...].p  pAn example to make this clearer is something like the following given a list [[0,1], [0,4], [0,3], [0,423], [1,232], [1,2], [2,444], [2,12]]p  pI want the output to group all the elements with the first integer so the output would be [[0, 1,4,3,432],[1, 232,2], [2, 444,12]]p  pNotes I have sorted the input list according to the first element in each item. p  pI have been stumped on how to implement this in a somewhat efficient manner for some time now, and would love to get some advicesuggestions as to how to implement this.p  pP.S. Ultimately I want this to combine all liked terms. What i mean is taking the above example, instead of getting the output [[0, 1,4,3,432],[1, 232,2], [2, 444,12]] I would get [[0, 1,4,3,432],[1, 232,2, 444,12]], where the 2 term and its shared elements have joined the elements associated with the 1 term since 1 is associated with 2.

This is one of the functions,p  precodepublic void playOnceint time      play     doClicktime     stop   public void play      channel[0].noteOnnote, 60   public void stop      channel[0].noteOffnote  codepre  pIll provide a minimal working example if necessary, but I wanted to make sure its not an obvious issue. The problem is that playOnce is called in a while loop. playOnce is in a Key class, and each Key has a different note. In each iteration of the while loop, playOnce is called on a different key. Once all the keys have been played, it stops.p  pThe doClick method correctly pressed the key, but its not released until all the keys have been played. In fact, while the keys are being played, you cant do anything, even press the pause button. For this problem, I guess I could put the entire loop in a different thread, but I dont think that type of solution will allow the key to be released.p  pEDIT Yea, I figured out I need a new thread to get other actions to work, but I still need a fix for doClick. This might be more complicated than I thought so heres a working example,p  pMain.javap  precodeimport java.awt.Container import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.GridBagConstraints import

Im trying to use MEF to inject a reference to to my WindowManager, by using [ImportingConstructor], in the base class. ie.p  precode[ImportingConstructor] public SomeViewModelIWindowManager windowmanager ... codepre  pThe issue is that before I added this, all I had was no param constructors, and the derived class is complaning about If I add a no param constructor to the base class, the WindowManager never gets injected.p  pUsing my currently limited knowledge the only way I can think of is to change the manager import to a Property Import, and just have a no param default constructor.

Negative 991 pSometimes it is useful to measure you sites performance in a full cached situation. But browsers make this hard to test, because on every manual page refresh it will revalidate all items, which results in a request for every resource on the webserver. Valid cacheitems will respond with a HTTP 304, invalid ones with a 200 OK. So you will end up with wrong timings for this particular usecase because of the latency to your webserver.p  pOne solution is to open a new tab, then enter the sites url, which results in my expected behaviour Cached items are served from disk. As soon as you hit refresh, the items revalidate again.p  pThis workflow open tab, open tab, and so on is kinda bad, so i want to ask, if anybody knows a better way to achieve this.

For example, lets say that we have six rows. When the coderemoveRow0code or coderemoveRow2code or coderemoveRow5code is called, the last row is always removed. Any idea, why this is happeningp  pThanksp  pupdatep  pWhen a particular cell of the jtable is pressed, the corresponding row should be removed.  p  precode    class TagsTableMA extends MouseAdapter       Override     public void mousePressedMouseEvent e         Point p  e.getPoint         int row  tagsJT.rowAtPointp         int column  tagsJT.columnAtPointp          if column  COLUMNDELETETAG             DocDialog docDialog  new DocDialogparentMainJF,                                                  true,                                                  null,                                                  Please confirm...,                                                  Are you sure you want to delete the                                                    tagsJT.getValueAtrow, COLUMNTAGNAME                                                   tag,                                                 DocDialog.TYPEYESNO             docDialog.show             int answer  docDialog.getAnswer              if answer  DocDialog.YES                                                                     model.removeRowrow                   codepre  p update no2 Here is some code with my issue.

Negative 991 pI am looking for a clean way to handle the situation where you have a resource representing a collection, but the authenticated user may only have authorization to access some subset of the resources in the collection.p  pFor example a blogging apip  pcodeGET postcode  lists postsp  pcodeGET post1code  get a specific postp  pPosts can be public or private. So if I have private access, the post api could return emallem posts, but if I only had public access it would be limited to returning only the public posts.p  pHow is this normally handled Are there caching ramifications Are there issues with maintaining the semantics of GET in this casep  pNote the authentication is handled via a token sent in a request header, not sure if that plays into it as well.p  pEdit To clarify I am interested in how to model this correctly in a RESTful system, not how to handle the actual authorization.p

Negative 991 pIm working on a design that has some image based shadows cant use CSS3 as theyre not simple shadows on the content area, which needs to be flexible vertically.p  pThe design has a white content area, with a shadow in the top right edge, a shadow on the bottom right corner and all the way along the bottom edge as you can see on the site.p  pIn order to try and do this Ive created a wrapper to try and deal with the top shadow, and then applied the background image to the bottom of the main content area within it to deal with the bottom shadows. Ive then made the background white. My thinking is that the bottom shadow image will always stick to the bottom of the content area no matter how much it expands, and the white colour will handle the rest.p  pProblem is, the shadow image obviously sits inside the div, and there is no way to make it hang out of the container... so as you can a hrefhttpjamesperrett.co.ukighthamindex.html relnofollowsee herea it looks weird.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netY2dSD6 relnofollowJSFiddle of the problema, you can see top shadow looks fine but the bottom one is sitting within the div so gets coloured in by the background colour too. p  pI cant get my head around a solution for this.

Negative 991 pIm preparing Android library for redistribution and its code must be obfuscated. Ive read something about this topic and Ive decided to use Android Library Project. It will be distributed as a jar automatically created in bin directory Im using eclipse with newest ADT. All the resources layouts, drawables, etc. will be distributed in separate package, which developer must add to his project manually same as manifest permissions and so. So till now everything works  jar added to my clean project does what it should and it sees resources added to my base project. But the problem is when I want to obfuscate this library jar the one generated automatically in Library projects bin directory. Since Eclipse supports obfuscation with Proguard only in regular Android projects when building APK, it doesnt provide obfuscation for Android Library Project jar isnt obfuscated, even when line proguard.configproguard.cfg is added to project.properties file. I think that the best way to obfuscate such a jar is to use Proguard outside from Eclipse then, but I dont know why I always get empty output jar  even when using parameters that I always used in my regular project, before Ive decided to extract library from this. Tested with proguard 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 with the same effect. I would be grateful if anyone could show me example proguard.conf that will allow for obfuscation of android library project e.g. basing on facebook Android Library Project that can be downloaded here a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebookfacebookandroidsdkzipballmaster relnofollowhttpsgithub.comfacebookfacebookandroidsdkzipballmastera.

Negative 991 pI was trying to accurately read codeACTIONMOVEcode deltas from a sequence of codeMotionEventcodes in Android.p  pMy tests with swiping a finger over the screen however suggest that after the initial codeACTIONDOWNcode, several codeMotionEventcodes are not delivered to the listener.

Negative 991 pIm new to Processing and serial communication and my problem seems very elementary.

Testing this with the included serial monitor behaves as Id expect typing in 0 returns 48.

Serial myPort  void setup    frameRate10   myPort  new Serialthis, Serial.list[4], 9600   void draw    myPort.write0  codepre  pI woud expect this code to return an endless stream of 48 with the rate of ten entries per second, since I understand that is the default frame rate. What really happens is something like thisp  precode48 48 488 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48  488 48 48 48 codepre  pIt seems like every 10th give or take a few byte has a good change of being messed up. Instead of 48 I get back stuff like  , 488, 4848 or 488. Whats even more interesting is that if I uncomment the frameRate10 line in my Processing script I would expect absolutely nothing to happen, since Im setting the fps from ten to ten. Instead I start to see stuff like thisp  precode4 44 4848844 444448444844 4 44444444 844 444 844444 8 88 8 4488 84 48 4448444844 444 codepre  pSo basically the numbers make so sense anymore.p  pIt took me quite some time to narrow the problem down to this serial communication and a few hours of Googling around related topics has given me no hints about what might be going on.

Negative 991 pIm looking for algorithm with an average case performance of OlogN, to extract the elements are between or equal to a min and a max value from a sorted list.p  pThe issue being that since the the min and max values may not actually be in the list, or perhaps even repeated, a binary search wont do. Ternary search seems to be closer to what I seek, but I havent been able to create a function that does what I see based on ternary search so far.p  pFor example, the input p  precodelist[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], min3, max6 codepre  pShould return [3,4,5,6]. Likewise, p  precodelist[500,757,2412,10000,123123], min  600, max  5000 codepre  pShould return [757,2412].p  pThis could  also be done in python less efficiently usingp  precodedef withinRangevalues,min,max    return [val for val in sortedvalues if val lt max and val gt min] codepre  pThe operation is called enough that a OlogN is very much preferred, and the sorting will only be done once.p

Negative 991 pI have a two dimensional array in php that I need to express as a javascript variable or object. Ive looked into json encoding it and decoding it for use as a javascript object and this doesnt make sense since I want to loop through my javascript convert. Expressing the php array as a javascript two dimensional array also doesnt really make sense because of how complicated multidimensional arrays are in javascript. What is the standard way of doing something like this As I said, I need to be able to loop through the results. The PHP array holds a number in the first dimension and a page name in the second. Im trying to find an efficient way to assign ids to a check box associated with each page name.

Negative 991 pIve been getting up to speed with Git very pleased with it so far but Im still a little confused about a couple of things. Im using SourceTree on a Mac.p  pIn particular, my team and I had been making changes, committing them and then pushing to our remote bare repo living on my linux server. Separately, I had been doing some experiments on my laptop and ended up with some divergent local changes.p  pRather than trying to merge them, I decided that I really wanted to just revert my laptop back to the state of the remote repo. I had tried pulling down changes from the remote repo and after being warned that I would need to merge, I decided to revert reset, I guess, in GIT language to the last offical commit. I did this for everything and was then able to pull down the files.p  pHowever, SourceTree told me that there were 24 changes that I had to push back to the remote server but I couldnt see what those changes were particularly since my goal was to not have anything I did be saved. That made me very nervous.p  pUltimately, I just blew away the entire folder including the .git and just cloned the remote respository again.p  pThe downside of that last is that if you have any untracked new files, they will just get deleted if you dont remember to copy them somewhere else temporarily.p  pMy question is whether there is any way to just revert my local working copy and the .git contents to whatever is the latest state of the remote repo, leaving any untracked files in the working copy untouchedp  pI did find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5283829whydoihavetopushthechangesijustpulledfromoriginingitWhy do I have to push the changes I just pulled from origin in Gita but it doesnt really answer either of the issues I describe here.p  pThanks in advance for any insights.p  pDp

Also, the months are actually inputs that change an image in the imageLoad div which I dont need. p  precodeltdiv idyearsgt     ltspan classyeargt2010ltspangt     ltspan classyeargt2011ltspangt     ltspan classyeargt2012ltspangt     etc... ltdivgt   ltdiv idmonthsgt     ltinput typeimage classmonth srcjanimage.png onclickchangepicjan gt     ltinput typeimage classmonth srcfebimage.png onclickchangepicfeb gt     ltinput typeimage classmonth srcmarimage.png onclickchangepicmar gt     etc... ltdivgt ltdiv iddaysgt     ltspan classdaygt1ltspangt     ltspan classdaygt2ltspangt     ltspan classdaygt3ltspangt     etc... ltdivgt  ltdiv idimageLoadgt ltdivgt ltdiv idcountgt ltdivgt codepre  pIm trying to loop through the links and record the count that appears for each combination of years, months, and days.  As you can see, the months are inputs that change the picture.p  pI tried a number of things.  The main thing I want to do is a nested loop that loops through each set of links, clicking them as I go. Here is the code Im using jQueryp  precodecasper.startlink  casper.thenfunction       pageInfo   this.evaluatefunction         values  []         forvar y  0 y lt years.length y             year years span.gety             year.click              forvar m  0 m lt months.length m                 month months input.getm                 month.click                  forvar d  0 d lt days.length d                     day days span.getd                     day.click                      values.pushcount.text                                                return values        codepre  pThis I thought would loop through each set of links in order, and I would get all the values from every variation of year, month and day.  p  pHowever, when I click on the month inputs in my script, the script breaks and goes to the next casper.then statement. Is there a better way for me to do thisp  pI have the feeling that Im going about this the wrong way, but nothing else Ive tried has been fruitful either.  It always seems like once it breaks to the next then  theres no coming back to my loop. p  pIve tried looping with codeCasper.eachcode, but I dont know how many elements there will be before hand.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 991 pIm trying to transfer and rename some files in a while loop using the subprocess.Popen[cp, etc..] and wait. Unfortunately it appears that wait command is not properly working, i.e. not waiting for the file to completely copy to the new directory. Most of the time the files copy over fine, however, a small subset of random files do not not the same files each time I run the script and are thus zero byte files or incomplete files. I have also tried using subprocess.checkcall but this does not work either. When I print the poll value its always zero which should mean the process has finished. Note all files Im dealing with are in the range of 150KBs. My python script is being run in pyraf utilising python 2.7, python version of iraf image reduction and analysis facility since Im using iraf routines.

Negative 991 pIm sure its something fairly simple, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why my child processes are doing no work, getting waited on, then the last one is pausing like Im not closing the pipes properly.  At any rate, Ill post a bunch of code but this is what its doingp  ol lipThe program parses a txt document and takes all individual words, and sends them along a pipe roundrobin style to a specified number of child processes.  I have a 1 dimensional array that holds the pipe FDs with every even index being a read, and every odd index being a write pipe.pli lipAfter the parsing is finished, the program closes the readwrite pipes prior to forking children to close the pipes with the parent. Then, within a for loop, the specified number of child processes are spawned and the write end of the corresponding pipes are closed off in the child, and the read ends are opened.  fgets MUST be used to take the input from the pipes I know, annoying, but its a requirement.  pli lipAfter the child is done, it gets waited on by the parent process.  There are some comment and debugger lines that Ive tried to get to help me, and from them it seems like the child processes are being forked and entered correctly, the write pipe is closed, the read pipe is opened, but when I do the fgets function, it immediately exits and gets waited on by the parent.  Interestingly, not all children get waited on.  If I want the number of children to be 3, 2 processes are waited on, the 3rd gets hung up.  If I want 10 processes, 5 get waited on, and the 6th gets hung up.pli ol  pSo, I am pretty certain it has something to do with fgets but I cannot figure out why  I have a hunch it may be something to do with newline characters being in the wrong spot when theyre sent along the pipe fgets reads up until newline, right but based on the code written and some additional debugging statement the input into the pipe from the parent process seems to be newline terminated properly. p  pAt any rate, heres the code for both the parser then the bit with creating the children p  pParserp  precodechar buf[PIPEBUF]      int wordCount  char buffer[PIPEBUF] char temp char word[50] FILE inputFile  fopenfileName,  r OPENS file Parsing and distributing words round robin to pipes whilefgetsbuffer, sizeof buffer, inputFile     remove all nonalpha chars in buffer and converts to lowercase     int i     fori  0 i lt strlenbuffer i         ifisalphabuffer[i]  0 0 means it is not a letter             buffer[i]                     else             buffer[i]  tolowerbuffer[i] turn the current word to lower case                   parse words and sends them to the sort processes in a roundrobin fashion     temp  strtokbuffer,   splits along spaces     iftemp  NULL         strcpyword, temp         strcatword, n puts newline at the end          int j  0     whiletemp  NULL         FILE input  fdopenpipefds[j21], w         closepipefds[j2] closing read pipes in parent         fputsword, input puts into write pipe         printffputs done successfully with pipe d with contents sn, pipefds[j21], word         closepipefds[j21] closing write pipe after write is done         temp  strtokNULL,           iftemp  NULL             strcpyword, temp             strcatword, n                  ifj  numChildren  1             j  0                  else             j                need to close all parent writes, and parent reads its done with everything fori  0 i lt numChildren i     closepipefds[i]  codepre  pParent forking and getting piped datap  precodeCollection of children need to be created specified by numChildren int count forcount  0 count lt numChildren count     printfCount dn, count      switchp  fork      case 1         perrorCould not create child         exit1      case 0         printfEntering childn         child case, GET INPUT FROM PARENT TO SORT SEND TO SUPPRESSOR Uses both input and output         count[0]  read, count[1]  write         closepipefds[count21] closing write pipes in child         printfwrite pipe closed in childn         FILE output  fdopenpipefds[count2], r opening the read pipe from the parent write pipe         printfread pipe opened in childn         fgetsbuf, PIPEBUF, output gets data from read pipe         printfchild read pipe contents read fgets with buf contents sn, buf         printfchild read pipe closed dn, getpid         execlpsort, sort, sortStuff,charNULL         closepipefds[count2] closing read pipe after reading is done         count  numChildren         break      default         parent case  p holds pid of child          printfI am the parent, PID dn, getpid         child  waitampstatus         printfWaited on child dn, child          break        codepre  pI apologize in advance for the code, Im not the best C programmer, so things tend to get a little messy.p
Negative 991 pI am learning JavaScript, and I would like to learn more about using JavaScript to handle money.  I understand that numbers have to be scaled before performing arithmetic on them.  The thing Id like to learn more about is converting amounts of money from one currency to another.  For example, maybe the currency of U.S. is converted to another countrys currency.  My problem is that I cant find any information on this subject.  Ive found a few APIs for currency conversion, but I have to pay before I can even use them.  I was hoping that there would be something like a tutorial, or maybe a currency conversion chart for developers which plainly describes the conversions.p  pThanks in advance.  Pp

So in order to read in the data, I suppressed the quotes, which worked fine for the first few files. ie.p  precodetestltread.csvpollresultsresultatsbureau11001.csv,header  TRUE,sep,,fileEncodinglatin1,as.isTRUE,quote codepre  pNow here is the problem in another file eg. pollresultsresultatsbureau12002.csv, there is a line of data like thisp  precode12002,Central Nova,NovaCentre, 61,Pictou, Subd. A,N,N,,0,168,Parker,,David K.,NDPNew Democratic Party,NPDNouveau Parti democratique,N,N,28 codepre  pBecause I need to suppress the quotes, the entry codePictou, Subd. Acode makes R wants to split this into 2 variables. The data cant be read in since it wants to add a column half way through constructing the dataframe.p  pExcel and OpenOffice both can open these files no problem.  Somehow, Excel and OpenOffice know that quotation marks emonly matter if they are at the beginning of a variable entryem.  p  pDo you know what option I need to enable on R to get this data in  I have 300 files that I need to load each with 1000 rows each so a manual fix is not an option...p  pI have looked all over the place for a solution but cant find one.p

Negative 991 pThis seems simple but I cant get it rightp  pThere are three entities codeFruitcode, codeVegetablecode and codeSnackcode. Snack has the fields codeidcode, codetimecode and codefoodcode. Food is a reference to emeitherem one fruit emorem one vegetable. So it is basically a manytooneonetomany relationship as one snack will always only hold one food. But there is more than one target entity.p  pHow would I map this in Doctrine2p  pA simple solution I would have used before knowing Doctrine2 would be to use two fields codefoodtypecode and codefoodidcode. But how can I make a connection from food type to the correct entity I thought about an array of JoinColumns but cant find a way to connect the correct entity. I also had a look at mapped superclasses because there is a DiscriminatorColumn, but it also seems to be the wrong approach. If I get it right the superclass cant be an entity itself  so I cannot create a food entity.p  pAny help is appreciated. Im sure I am missing something simple here.p

Negative 991 pI want to create a dataflowdiagram for a three tiered software architecture, finally I want to create a Threat Model with the Dataflow diagram. p  pThe software is supposed to be some kind of a gateway. It accepts HTTP Requests via a RESTInterface and offers different kinds of services to the user. It has three different layers which offer different functionalities, every Layer CAN be executed on a different machine.p  ul liBoundary Layer Accepts the Requestli liControl Layer Offers the Business Logicli liAdapter Layer Dataconnection to the BackEnd Systemsli ul  pExample  Lets just assume the User wants to create a DOC File with the help of the Sofware. He would request a DOC File on the Boundary Layer which would forward this request to the control layer where the business logic happens. The control layer would request the required data from the adapter layer. p  pNow this is a pretty straight forward example. p  pMy question is the followingp  pIs every layer  Boundary, Control, Adapter  a Process in the dataflow diagram which needs to be decomposed into smaller Processes or do I just display the process as Generate DOC documentp  pNow what would happen if every layer ist executed on different machines  would that change the Dataflow Diagram or would it stay the same since the dataflow stays the same  only the underlying architecture changesp  pThanks a lot.p
Negative 991 pDiscovered this problem while working on a project at work, but have managed to replicate it using the DocCode sample from Breeze. I am using the latest 1.3.0. Basically the wrong records are being returned by the query when using expand, orderby and take. The problem can be demonstrated with the products sorted by related Category descending test in queryTests.jsp  pThe query in the test isp  precode    var query  EntityQuery.fromProducts         .expandCategory         .orderByCategory.CategoryName desc, ProductName codepre  pWhich causes the following SQL to be issued to SQL Serverp  precodeSELECT  [Extent1].[ProductID] AS [ProductID],  [Extent1].[ProductName] AS [ProductName],  [Extent1].[SupplierID] AS [SupplierID],  [Extent1].[CategoryID] AS [CategoryID],  [Extent1].[QuantityPerUnit] AS [QuantityPerUnit],  [Extent1].[UnitPrice] AS [UnitPrice],  [Extent1].[UnitsInStock] AS [UnitsInStock],  [Extent1].[UnitsOnOrder] AS [UnitsOnOrder],  [Extent1].[ReorderLevel] AS [ReorderLevel],  [Extent1].[Discontinued] AS [Discontinued],  [Extent2].[CategoryID] AS [CategoryID1],  [Extent2].[CategoryName] AS [CategoryName],  [Extent2].[Description] AS [Description],  [Extent2].[Picture] AS [Picture] FROM  [dbo].[Products] AS [Extent1] LEFT OUTER JOIN [dbo].[Categories] AS [Extent2] ON [Extent1].[CategoryID]  [Extent2].[CategoryID] ORDER BY [Extent2].[CategoryName] DESC, [Extent1].[ProductName] ASC codepre  pWhich is fine and gives the correct results sorted by CategoryName. However, if I change the query to the followingp  precode    var query  EntityQuery.fromProducts         .expandCategory         .orderByCategory.CategoryName desc, ProductName.take10 codepre  pI have added the .take10.

Negative 991 pI have a generic Image model that is linked to by other models that need to have images attached.  In most places the image is not required and we have fallbacks in case there is no image uploaded, but in a few particular cases I need to force the upload of an image for the form to validate, but Im not sure how to validate that through another model.  For instance, my model is something like thisp  precodeclass Person extends AppModel     public belongsTo  array       Image gt array          className gt Image,          foreignKey gt imageid,          type gt LEFT,              public validate  array      ...     codepre  pThe codePersoncode model contains some text fields that folks have to enter as well as a coderedirecturlcode field.  If a redirect is set the page logic will skip trying to load anything and will redirect directly to that URL.  But, if it is emnotem set then a bunch of other fields are required.  Ive got this working properly using a custom validation method in my codePersoncode model, but codeimageidcode field is not explicitly checked by the codePersoncode model since it is just a pointer to the codeImagecode model.p  pCan I somehow add a customdynamic validation rule to codeImagecode in this instance to have it check if codePerson.redirecturlcode is set  The only thing I can figure to do is to add this to my codebeforeSavecode and basically manually check it using codethisgtdatacode but Id like to do this the right way if its possible, hooking into the Validation class.p  pI tried a few variations on using something like this, with no luck thus far p  pcodethisgtPersongtImagegtvalidate[id]array...codep  pstrongEditstrongp  pHere is what Ive tried doing, which kind of worksp  precodepublic function beforeValidateoptionsarray      parentbeforeValidateoptions      ifemptythisgtdata[redirecturl]          if issetthisgtdata[Image][filepath]              thisgtinvalidateImage.filepath, Custom error message.             return false                codepre  pThis lets me invalidate the field without having to add extra code elsewhere, but when printing out the form field on the front end, I end up getting a generic This file is required error instead of my Custom error message.  I think this might be because file uploads are handled by a plugin that spirits them away to S3 instead of the local filesystem and its getting overridden somewhere up the chain.p

Negative 991 pbr  I need to create a calendar and then send this calendar via email as an attachment.

I have to provide compatibility forp  ol liGmailli liAndroid using gmailli liiOS Calendarli liOutlookli ol  pThe lookampfeel I have to provide resembles the one you can have on Gmail, so with acceptdecline link. The solution I found works fine on Gmail, Outlook and other clients such as Thunderbird, but not on iOS or Android at least on old version prior to 4.0.3 where you can install the Google Calendar app. Basically, iOS does not show acceptdecline links by default, but you have to click on the attachment no matter which way I send the calendar, setting the contenttype to codetextcalendarcode generates the mail client of iOS to display a codemimeattachment.icscode to be able to add the calendar to your personal calendar. br  My approach now is to convert the ics file to some html, and format the body of the email with a codemultipartalernativecode field sorry, I dont have a better term for this so that clients which understand codetextcalendarcode will show that part, while clients which dont understand it will show the html part. Now, my question is how do I generate the links For instance, I extracted a link and it looks likep  precodelta hrefhttpswww.google.comcalendareventactionRESPONDampampeidlongeidrst1ampamptoklesslongtokampampctzEuropeRomeampamphlen stylecolor20cwhitespacenowrap itempropurlgtYesltagt codepre  pHow do I generate the codeeidcode and the codetokcode It seems to me they are some sort of hash code or anyway some sort of code.br  On the other hand, if you know about a better approach to generate the calendar and having it to work on at least the clients I mentioned earlier feel free to suggest.

This issue is seen on devices with 2.12.3 android versions, but there are some reports from newer version like 4.0.4 or even 4.2.2. So I cant really tell what caused the image failing to loadp  pAnother issue is codeIOERROR java.io.EOFExceptioncode, which is mostly seen on newer android versions. p  pThird of most common errors are outofmemory errors... The images I am trying to load are no bigger than 1mb, but I need to have ScaleType.Exactly, but while loading larger images I am not caching them in memory or disc, to reduce possibility of outofmemory, but it still does occur pretty often.  p  pMy configurationp  precodeImageLoaderConfiguration config  new ImageLoaderConfiguration.Builderxxx.getApplicationContext .threadPoolSize4 .memoryCachenew WeakMemoryCache .imageDownloadernew BaseImageDownloaderxxx.getApplicationContext,10  1000, 30  1000  .build  ifImageLoader.getInstance.isInited       ImageLoader.getInstance.initconfig   options is used for images smaller in size 5kb150kb options  new DisplayImageOptions.Builder .cacheInMemory .cacheOnDisc .showStubImageR.drawable.stub .showImageOnFailR.drawable.failed .imageScaleTypeImageScaleType.EXACTLY .bitmapConfigBitmap.Config.RGB565 .build   options2 is used for images big in size 300kb1,2mb options2  new DisplayImageOptions.Builder .showStubImageR.drawable.stub .showImageOnFailR.drawable.failed .imageScaleTypeImageScaleType.NONE  NONE because I need to have full size bitmap loaded .bitmapConfigBitmap.Config.RGB565 .build codepre  pCould anyone tell me how could I optimize my imageLoading to get less failed to load images Because I feel like I am loosing users some because of these constant failings to load images.p  pstrongUpdatestrong As I changed the code as nostra suggested on codeonLoadingFailedcode, Im now seeing that all the reports which does not have code.getCausecode are DECODINGERROR and all these are reported by android 2.22.3.6 versions, none from newer ones. Yet still large portion of my users are on older androids, any idea how to reduce this decodingerror I checked app myself on older androids, and images do load most of the time, but codeDECODINGERRORcode is reported most often on analytics. Second on most popular reasons is still the same codeIOERROR java.io.EOFExceptioncodep  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pCustomized Downloader as nostra suggested, reduced threadPoolSize to 3 set up an extra loading  if loading failed try to load again for one time before giving up. I see failings to load decreased about 30. But still do occur  100 decoding errors exclusively only on 2.22.3.6 versions , and 160 EOF errors 4.0 and up in 3 days from 500 daily active users. p  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pLatest updated version gets far less decoding errors and EOFExceptions, I think mainly because I try to reload the same image if it fails to load the first time.

Negative 991 pThis seems like it would be a common question, but I cant seem to find an answerp  pIs there a way to locate the specific library that VS uses to link a particular function at link timep  pIm using Visual studio to build a multiproject solution.  I have a Solution The Library solution that generates a bunch of .libs  that are used across multiple programs. One of these libs is generated from Fortran code Intel Fortran 77 compiler enforcing UPPERCASE names. p  pI statically link these libraries into the solution that I build my application in which happens to be in C, with the appropriate extern Cs and prototypes. p  pThe issue I have, is that I can delete the library that generates a particular function, and my program happily compiles okay fine and links what the crap. So I go to every library in LinkerInputAdditional dependencies, and do an objdump looking for the function well subroutine in fortran name, and it doesnt come up. I do the same thing for all Project dependencies, and still no dice. p  pIf I go and change the libraries and all function calls and prototypes to something random like myFunction12345 and recompile and link, everything works as I would expect, so clearly something is getting linked in that I cant find. p  pfwiw my function name is AIRp  pIm less interested in solving my particular problem as I am in learning how to figure out what LIBs are being used by VS at link time. Addidionally, Id love to know if there is some linker flag that can be thrown to warn, or error out if there are multiply defined objects at link time. p  pany ideasp

Negative 991 pI am currently working in strongWindows Form Appsstrong and am making what will essentially be a map editor for a game. The way i have gone about this is by having a central codeTabControlcode where each codeTabPagecode contains a custom codePictureBoxcode control and all the other UI controls are around this central codeTabControlcode. The codePictureBoxcode uses its Paint event to draw everything that is placed on the map, and therefore draws multiple images of many sizes, rotations and scales etc to the single codePictureBoxcode. This has all gone well so far. The codeTabPagecode is essentially used as a view window for the codePictureBoxcode and is of size 1280x720.p  pThe problem is with the scale to which the maps are being produced. The avg and also maximum map size on screen is around em19200x10800pxem and can be made up of hundreds of items at any one point. When drawing just a backdrop image of size em19200x10800pxem the codePictureBoxcode starts to flicker when it redraws and makes the program unusable. As the map is so big you are able to pan around them and this is where the flickering really shows. Also i do not want to use a em19200x10800pxem image source if possible for the sake of file sizes and the scaled image quality isnt an issue at all.p  pI have done heaps of reading on why this might be and feel like I have tried everything up until this point. So far ive triedp  ul liHaving the background image only 1920x1080 and scaling it up by 10xli liStarting with a 1920x1080 image, programatically resizing it and drawing this imageli liSlicing the background into multiple segments i tried many different amounts and drawing only the ones that the view window can see tried this for both a small1080p and large10800p imagesli liUsing graphics clipping so that only the things on screen would be drawnli liUsed Double Buffering on both the picturebox and the form that the picturebox is onli liConverting the image at initialisation to an optimised bitmap with faster formatting and then drawing the bitmapli ul  pIve probably tried a couple other things along with minor optimisations but its taken me so long ive forgotten the rest. From what ive read its most likely something to do with the control redrawing too slowly for some sort of performance reason or a limitation with pictureboxs, however exactly what is going on i cannot tell due to lack of experience with form apps controls.p  pCurrently to draw the background in the codePaintcode event i have eitherp  precodeg.DrawImageimage, new Rectangle0, 0, intimage.Size.Width  levelScale, intimage.Size.Height  levelScale codepre  porp  precodeg.ScaleTransformlevelScale, levelScale g.DrawImageimage, new Rectangle0, 0, intimage.Size.Width, intimage.Size.Height codepre  pWhere g is the codeGraphicscode object.p  pHave I hit the limit of Win form apps capabilities or is there something i may be missingp  pAny and all help appreciated, p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 991 pI recently got the assignment to write a unit test for an existing standalone Java GUI Application.p  pUp to this point I have written an application that allows one to create macros by recording mouse and keyboardinput and the time between single events and execute these macros. This works for checking the application for critical errors, but there is currently no possibility of checking the data of the underlying GUI. It would be very nice if I could check the data via JUnit assertequals etc.p  pHow can I accomplish this Is this a case for reflectionp

Negative 991 pI am looking for recommendations on document templating modules for an application that I am creating.p  pThe application is an online service for a specific type of stores. I wont go into details about the service, mainly because I think it is irrelevant in regards to the problem.p  pMy problem is basically this. I want my customers to be able to create their own document templates for certain sales documents. By document templates I mean layout of manuals and invoices etc. I basically provide a JSON document with the information to be merged into the template.p  pThe JSON document can both include per document information such as logo, addresses but also arrays of information that should be presented as lists with totals and sub totals. The templates should also be able to handle paging and differentiate between first, last, even and odd pages. If it can handle different formats such as A4 and Letter that would be awesome as well. If localisation is supported, you should be able to hear my scream of joy. p  pIf I can get out of having to implement such a templating service myself, I would gladly pay for it. I am open to different approaches of creating the templates. If the templates need to be created by a professional or someone with knowledge of specific tools such as PhotoShop or other design tools, that isnt a showstopper. If I can create a set of perhaps 10 standard templates and then let customers pay for custom templates, possibly by going to a third party design bureau that is fine. Web browser editing is also an option.p  pI would prefer to be able to externalise this completely from my application so I have call this as a web service or a REST Api, either hosted by me or by a cloud partner. That also means that I am rather indifferent when it comes to the language this is implemented in.p  pThe output format needs to be at least PDF.p  pI just dont know of any options out there that does this, and was hoping for suggestions from you guys.p  pThanks, JPp
Negative 991 pCurrently I have two almost identical schemasp  precodevar userSchema  mongoose.Schema      email type String, unique true, required true, validate emailValidator,     passwordHash type String, required true,      firstname type String, validate firstnameValidator,     lastname type String, validate lastnameValidator,     phone type String, validate phoneValidator,   codepre  pAndp  precodevar adminSchema  mongoose.Schema      email type String, unique true, required true, validate emailValidator,     passwordHash type String, required true,      firstname type String, validate firstnameValidator, required true,     lastname type String, validate lastnameValidator, required true,     phone type String, validate phoneValidator, required true,   codepre  pTheir only difference is in validation Users do not need a firstname, lastname or phone. Admins however must have these properties defined.p  pUnfortunately the above code is not very DRY, as theyre almost identical. Therefore I am wondering if it is possible to build an codeadminSchemacode based on the codeuserSchemacode. E.g.p  precodevar adminSchema  mongoose.SchemauserSchema adminSchema.changefirstname, required true adminSchema.changelastname, required true adminSchema.changephone, required true codepre  pObviously thats just pseudocode. Is something like this possiblep  pAnother very similar question is if it is possible to create a new schema based on another, and add some more properties to it. For examplep  precodevar adminSchema  mongoose.SchemauserSchema     adminSchema.addadminPower Number codepre
Negative 991 pI have setup Nginx in front of two IIS servers.  The main goal is to load balance, ssl offload, and cache static content. p  pWhat i am having a really tough time with is showing a maintenance page when all the Upstream servers are either unavailable or throwing 404 errors.  I have created a maintenance.html file on my NginX box but cannot get it to load.  I can sometimes get it to load IIS 404s, and sometimes get it to load the default NginX 404.  What I am really trying to do is if for some reason all the upstreams are down or throwing 404s is to show the user a Maintenance page and eventually put in some code in that page to alert me that all the upstream servers have gone down. p  pHere is my Configurationp  precode         ACTUAL SITE WITH  SSL CERTIFICATE     Backend IIS Servers upstream backendiis        Health Checks     healthcheckenabled      healthcheckdelay 5000      healthchecktimeout 5000      healthcheckfailcount 1        Upstream Servers         server ww1.pickle.com  maxfails3  failtimeout31s         server ww2.pickle.com  maxfails3  failtimeout31s         server ww3.pickle.com         Sticky Sessions       sticky       iphash      Server Configuration server        Server Specific Settings        servername        www.pickle.com        accesslog         varlognginxwww.pickle.com.log         keepalivetimeout  5        allow              all        servertokens      off         gzip               on        gzipvary          on       SSL Settings with SPDY 2        ssl on        listen 443 ssl spdy         sslcertificate usrsharenginxsslcertspicklecompicklebasic.crt       sslcertificate usrsharenginxsslcertspicklecompickleev.crt        sslcertificatekey        usrsharenginxsslcertspicklecompickle.com.key        sslsessiontimeout        15m        sslprotocols              SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2        sslciphers                RC4HIGHaNULLMD5        sslpreferserverciphers  on        sslsessioncache          sharedSSL10m          Proxy Pass to backendiis     location                 root               usrsharenginxsitespickledown            Proxy Header to Keep Ip Address and Hostname          proxyredirect    off          proxysetheader  Host              www.pickle.com          proxysetheader  XRealIP         remoteaddr          proxysetheader  XForwardedFor   proxyaddxforwardedfor          proxysetheader  XForwardedProto scheme            Proxy Pass to Backend IIS Servers          proxypass             httpbackendiis           proxynextupstream    error timeout http404          proxytemppath        usrsharenginxtemp           Intercept Proxy Errors show Nginx Error Pages          proxyintercepterrors on                   errorpage 404 500 502 503 504  maintenance              Proxy Pass to backendiis     location maintenance           internal          root        usrsharenginxsitespickledown          index  maintenance.html index.html index.htm          allow all             errorpage 500 502 503 504 50x.html    location  50x.html     root html        errorpage 404 404.html    location  usrsharenginxsitespickledown404.html     root html     codepre

Negative 991 pI just wrote a SQL Function as belowp  precodeCreate Function LAeqFrequency Decimal18,2, Sound Decimal18,2   RETURNS DECIMAL18,2  AS  BEGIN declare T1 Decimal 28, 10 DECLARE T2 Decimal 28, 10 DECLARE T3 Decimal 28, 10 DECLARE T4 Decimal 28, 10 DECLARE T5 Decimal 28, 10 DECLARE T6 Decimal 28, 10 DECLARE T7 Decimal 28, 10  SET T1  POWER12200.0,2  POWERFrequency, 4 SET T2  POWER Frequency, 2  POWER20.6,2 SET T3  POWER Frequency, 2  POWER107.7,2 SET T4  POWER Frequency, 2  POWER737.9,2 SET T5  POWER Frequency, 2  POWER12200.0,2 SET T6  SQRTT3 T4  T5  T2 SET T7  T1 T6 SET T7  Sound  2.0  20.0  LOG10T7 RETURN T7 END codepre  pThis function works if I pass value 0.8, 26.

Negative 991 pSo Ive don all the preliminary steps of setting the codeaudioSession sharedInstancecode category, and activated playing audio in the background in the info.plist filep  pHowever I am using an UIWebView to display YouTube, and even thought background playing is  supported, pressing the home button the audio stops.

Negative 991 pI have custom table view cells that each have 3 buttons.

Negative 991 pIm updating a PHP project using PHPStorm. I first started using SCSS by turning on the PHPStorm watch for the file type. It works fine. I then wanted to incorporate Compass. I successfully installed it and ran Compass create bare in my project directory. Now when I include import compasstypographyverticalrhythm, it cant find it. Its not surprising as there is no compass subdirectory. How do I install the required components Didnt see any Compass option that seemed appropriate. I used the bare option because thats whats the Compass site gave me for an existing project.p  pOnce I get it installed, do I need the Compass watch given I already have a file watcher running for SCSS files The description of it indicates it does the same thing.p  pRunning OS X 10.8.4p
Negative 991 pI am trying to do the spring security tutorial a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringsecuritysitetutorial.html relnofollow at this linka.  p  pIn the section entitled strongRunning the Tutorial application without Spring Securitystrong, I took the following steps adjusted for differences between the current version and the version that was in use when the tutorial was written  p  precode1. I downloaded the latest release of the Spring Security Distribution,    2. found and unzipped a war file in the dist directory called springsecuritysamplestutorial3.1.2.RELEASE.war   3. Renamed the resulting folder springsecuritytutorial   4. Created a general project in eclipse called springsecuritytutorial   5. Imported all of the contents of the unzipped springsecuritysamplestutorial3.1.2.RELEASE.war   6. Right clicked on the project in eclipse and selected configure...convert to maven project   7. Then right clicked on the project and clicked run as...   codepre  pBut there was no run on server option.  I had chosen a general project instead of a Dynamic Web Project in hopes of preserving the file structure of the application to be importedp  pI then started to repeat the process, but creating a Dynamic Web Project instead of a general project, and eclipse wants me to select the src folders on build path.  The file structure of the web application has 8 .class files in subfolders of WEBINF, and I am not able to locate any .java files.  p  pWhat steps can I take in order to download this and run it in eclipse on the server  With the ability to edit the classes  p  pI have read that I can select a .class file in eclipse and it will open the bytecode in the editor, so I imagine I can convert the class files to java files easily enough.  But doing that within a general project triggers the error message that the class is not part of the classpath, so we need to get it in a working web project that can be run on the tomcat server from within eclipse first, I think.p

Negative 991 pI have a database with strings and which language this string belongs.

Ive tried doing it in JSON, but some translation have quotes and double quotes, and its a hell to escape and get it all correct  because escaping just escapes the whole JSON string, not only translation.p  pSo, what Ive done is loop the whole array and echoing the translation in a Javascript associative array again, but this time with addslashes  only the translation.p  pHowever, if I look to the Source Code, I see 600 lines of Javascripts entries, one for each translation of course, this has nothing strange, just simply UGLY.p  pI was wondering if theres a much cleaner way of passing this translation array to my Javascript code without having to loop the PHP array and echo it to a JS variable.p  pThanks for your time and answersp

I have this simple program who adds 2 numbers.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int addFuncint, int  int main       int sum     int num11, num22      sum  addFuncnum1,num2     function call       printfnsum  dnn, sum      return 0     int addFuncint a,int b        function declarator       int add      add  a  b      return add             return statement of function.  codepre  pSince this function isnt codevoidcode there is a codereturncode statement in the function. If I omit the return value, save it and compile it, I dont get any errors from the compiler nor warnings. And when I run it it gives me a correct result.p  pBut how does the program know which value to return, since I dont specify any Does C return the last calculated variable in the functionp

Negative 991 pIm new in x86. My question is about function calls. As far as i know there is three function call types short call 0xe8, far call 0x9a and near call 0x. Some call short call a relative call ip  arg  cs  inv and far call an absolute call ip  arg  cs  arg, but what about near call ip    cs  . Some say that calling function far 9a is almost certainly wrong on 32bit systems. Why Doesnt x86 mean 32bit system Is far calls argument a flat address the one we use in c or other languages or csip notated and how do i convert a plain address into csip form Is there other function call typesp

It may not be the most effective way of representing a Grid or finding a Shortest Path, but Id like to try it this way.p  pFor examplep  precode[[x,x,x,x,x,x,x],  [x,1,o,o,o,o,x],  [x,,,,o,,x],  [x,,,o,o,,x],  [x,o,o,o,o,2,x],  [x,o,,,o,o,x],  [x,x,x,x,x,x,x]] codepre  pA few assumptions I can make either given or based on checking before pathfindingp  ul liThe grid is squareli liTheir will always exist a path from 1 to 2li li1 can pass through anything except  walls or x bordersli ul  pThe goal is for 1 to find a shortest path to 2.p  pIn the instance ofp  precode[[x,x,x,x,x,x,x],  [x,o,o,1,o,o,x],  [x,,o,o,o,,x],  [x,,o,,o,,x],  [x,o,o,2,o,o,x],  [x,o,,,,o,x],  [x,x,x,x,x,x,x]] codepre  pNotice, there are two Shortest pathsp  precode[d,l,d,d,r] codepre  pandp  precode[d,r,d,d,l] codepre  pIn Prolog, Im trying to make the function if thats the proper namep  precodeshortestPathGrid,Path codepre  pIve made a function to find elements 1 and 2, and a function that verifies that the grid is valid, but I cant even begin how to start constructing a function to find a shortest path from 1 to 2.p  pGiven a defined Grid, Id like the output of Path to be the shortest path. Or, given a defined Grid AND a defined Path, Id like to check if its indeed a shortest path.p  pHelp would be much appreciated If I missed anything, or was unclear, let me knowp
Negative 991 pI am facing trouble doing my readfile for my name and score. p  pI can read the name but i cant read my score.p  pSo I will be posting up two codes. one is the full one and the second one is the read file code.p  pI am trying to save and read the save file for my name and score.p  pHowever, I can only save the name and the score forever remains 0.p  pMay I know whats the mistake I

Negative 991 pMy clients speak with my servers over custom protocol. Now Im adding chat system backed by XMPP server ejabberd. My server will tunnel user messages to XMPP server by logging in XMPP server on behalf of all its clients. p  pSince a single server can have multiple clients it would be fine to have a single TCP connection from my server to XMPP server. Is this possible If yes, how to do this Im not familiar with XMPP yet. p  pSeems like XML stream is opened at the beginning and closed at the end, and closing tag doesnt have any indication which stream to close. So I assume I cannot have multiple XML streams over the same TCP connection. Please correct.p  pI can try to login multiple times with different usernames and specify from anywhere its allowed. I noticed that on many places from attribute is optional and ejabberd can assume it probably based on connection, so I worry if this is possible.p
Negative 991 pWhen building a set of statistics from a dictionary, I process the various entries such as by user. THus, I can build the various statistics for each user. While doing this, I also build the statistics for a dummy user that I can call total.

Negative 991 pI have a Windows Azure service, and want to use an unmanaged library to process a file. The API currently requires an input file name and output file name, but I have some control over this library. Is there an easy way to do this for files currently being stored in a blob Ive read that mounting a blob as a drive requires a bit of extra effort and possibly external software, which Id like to avoid. I could copy the files to azure drive storage, but that method seems suboptimal. My original thought was to read the data from the blob into memory in my manager worker, and pass an unmanaged pointer to the data to the library, which would then pass my a pointer to memory representing the output of the library would this be the most efficient solution in an azure environmentp  pSome clarification on the flow of eventsp  ol liDocument is created by webrole1 in memoryli liDocument is uploaded to blob storageli liworker1 realizes there is a documentli liworker1 needs to utilize functionality in a c library, NativeCode.dll.

Negative 991 pIm beginner in ServletsJSP and now trying to do a little webproject but faced some issues which I cant solve. Id like to ask you to give an idea of correct structure of the project see the image. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiLFOb.png altenter image description herep  pThe main part of its project is couple of tables with editable data which is sent through servlet to DB. Rows can be added and deleted from table as same as frm DB. I have the list of contractors also  by clicking on each I have relevant tables with data. I consider the following structure each row in the table OrdersInvoices is a form which is submited and sent to the servlet when the data is entered and saved in DB. It is clear for me. I dont know how to make request to a servlet when I click on any contractor from the list to get in response the relevant table. I tried to make it by XMLHttpRequest but it doesnt work properly. More over, If I understand it correct, the response should be in JSP which create page with relevant table for shosen contractor. Is it possible to get JSP response by using Ajax Browsing stackoverflow to find needed answers I got that the best way is to use jQuery both for editable table and communication with server but as I said Im newcomer and would like to pay the most attention to javaservletjspjdbc in the first place and only then come to frontend technologies.  I would appreciate a lot for ideas regarding the structure of the project.p

Negative 991 pit seems like I am close, but I am missing something with this. I want to create a tip calculator where you enter the amount of your original bill, then click a  button 10, 15, or 20 which calculates your tip and places it into a TextView field, which represents your total bill called finalBill with tip added.p  pBut I tried using codefinalBill.setTextfinalB.getTextcode, but I get an error saying getText is undefined. I have only set up the 10 button right now, but once I get it right, I will apply this code to the 15 and 20 methods too. p  pThe original bill will be entered by the user as a double although its in an EditText field, the calculation in the 10 button needs to happen with doubles, and the final bill should be either a String or some text so that it can fill the TextView field called finalBill. Please try to stick with the original code as much as possible, as Im a beginner and get confused easily.

Negative 991 pIm looking for help in finding the source of jitter when using collision detection. Ive implemented a java game using eclipse and slick2d and have been loosely following this guide a hrefhttpkatyscode.wordpress.com201301182dplatformgamescollisiondetectionfordummies relnofollowhttpkatyscode.wordpress.com201301182dplatformgamescollisiondetectionfordummiesap  pbut of course changing bits where necessary to suit my game and java not cpp.p  pFrom the research I have done I think the root cause of my jitter is coming from rounding errors.  Despite that being my main suspect, I still havent been able to identify where its occurring.p  pSorry if the indentation isnt quite right there, had a little trouble using the code block recognition.p  pBasically Im creating variables in the class. In init I set up most of the resources. In render all the drawing takes place. Note the graphics translation so the camera follows the player. In update Im of course updating the position of the player according to user input, gravity and friction.p  pI also call my collision detection from this method. Collision detection is working on a penetration resolution method. p  pYes I know Im exhaustively comparing with every single world object. I will be improving my efficiency with AABBs when I have sorted more fundamental problems out. Like jitterp  pMy method first calculates how much the player expects to move in each axis, then for each world object it checks for intersection with the players bounding points floating point values that represent coordinates around the player. It checks this in each direction and uses the result to determine in which axis the collision occurred, if any, so that the appropriate action can be taken.p  pSorry its a put load of code, but its collision detection after all, which isnt a small thing.p  pHere is my Play class where all the updating goes on for the gamep  precodepackage GameFiles import java.io.BufferedReader import

Negative 991 pI want to ask how can i filter mysql data if the condition is checked for a column with several comma separated values. I give you an example p  pI have following table say tbitems p  precodeid     itemnames     itemtypes    itemfeatures 1      item 1        8,6          10,5,4,9,8,6 2      item 2        8,6          10,5,8 codepre  pNow suppose i want to fetch the records items that have item types either 8 or 6 but having itemfeatures exactly equal to what we specify for example 10, 5, and 4.p  pI know for the first condition item types we can use IN operator.p  pBut I dont know how we can filter the record based on itemfeatures.p  pI can write the query like this p  pcodeSELECT  FROMcodetbitemscodeWHEREcodeitemtypescodeIN 8 ANDcodeitemfeatures strongWHAT OPERATOR SHOULD COM HERE TO SELECT ONLY THESE VALUESstrong  4, 5, 10p  pIf i use IN like i did for first condition then the second row of above table is also fetched because 5 and 10 are available in the set 10,5,8 but i want to extract only first row. Any ideap  pstrongEDIT strongp  pSorry, your workaround didnt work.p  pI wanted to get only first row of this table p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqiNGi.png altenter image description herep  pBut now it is yielding some extra rows that i didnt want. And moreover i cant use so many FINDINSET since there commaseparated values may be large in numbers. Also i couldnt use this sql in my PHP code. p

Negative 991 pThe basic problem is that I wish to limit number of recipients for outgoing mail using Postfix sendmail. I added codedefaultrecipientlimit2code and codedefaultdestinationlimit2code to codemain.cfcode and reload postfix, but testing it by sending more than 2 emails fails. p  pThere is a response to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23003276whysmtpdrecipientlimitandotheremailrelatedoptionsinpostfixdoesnotwoposta that says You cant restrict recipient count for the mails submitted through sendmail command. I suppose this is referring to any application that invokes codeusrsbinsendmailcode installed by Postfix. I couldnt confirm this in Postfix documentation or on Google. Can someone verify, and explain why it is or not possible to limit number of outgoing recipients on Postfix sendmail More generally, what quotas or options can be configured with Postfix sendmail  p

What is the bestcase strategy to avoid hitting the database all the time Is it to have all in memory and ordersortfilter in Java instead of SQL queriesp  pThanks for your feedback.p  pUpdate Heres the ehcache.xmlp  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt     ltehcache nameCache xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsinoNamespaceSchemaLocationehcache.xsdgt         ltdefaultCache maxEntriesLocalHeap10000 timeToIdleSeconds0                  timeToLiveSeconds0gt                ltpersistence strategydistributedgt          ltelementValueComparator classnet.sf.ehcache.store.DefaultElementValueComparatorgt                 ltterracotta clusteredtruegt             ltnonstop enabledtrue gt         ltterracottagt     ltdefaultCachegt       ltterracottaConfig rejointrue urltcURL9510 gt     ltehcachegt codepre  pand the hibernate configuration taken from Grailsp  precodehibernate      cache.usesecondlevelcache  true     cache.usequerycache  false     cache.region.factoryclass  net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.EhCacheRegionFactory  codepre

Negative 991 pIm currently developing an application of Speech Recognition using Microsoft Kinect SDK.

Negative 991 pThe point of the application is to recognize an image from an already set list of images. The list of images have had their SIFT descriptors extracted and saved in files. Nothing interesting here p  precodestdvectorltcvKeyPointgt detectedKeypoints cvMat objectDescriptors   Extract data cvSIFT sift sift.detectimage, detectedKeypoints sift.computeimage, detectedKeypoints, objectDescriptors   Save the file cvFileStorage fsfile, cvFileStorageWRITE fs ltlt descriptors ltlt objectDescriptors fs ltlt keypoints ltlt detectedKeypoints fs.release codepre  pThen the device takes a picture. SIFT descriptors are extracted in the same way. The idea now was to compare the descriptors to the ones from the files. I am doing that using the FLANN matcher from OpenCV. I am trying to quantify the similarity, image by image. After going through the whole list I should have the best match. p  precodeconst cvPtrltcvflannIndexParamsgtamp indexParams  new cvflannKDTreeIndexParams1 const cvPtrltcvflannSearchParamsgtamp searchParams  new cvflannSearchParams64   Match using Flann cvMat indexMat cvFlannBasedMatcher matcherindexParams, searchParams stdvectorlt cvDMatch gt matches matcher.matchobjectDescriptors, readDescriptors, matches codepre  pAfter matching I understand that I get a list of the closest found distances between the feature vectors. I find the minimum distance and, using it I can count good matches and even get a list of the respective points p  precode Count the number of mathes where the distance is less than 2  mindist int goodCount  0 for int i  0 i lt objectDescriptors.rows i      if matches[i].distance lt  2  mindist              goodCount          Save the points for the homography calculation         obj.pushbackdetectedKeypoints[matches[i].queryIdx].pt         scene.pushbackreadKeypoints[matches[i].trainIdx].pt       codepre  pIm showing easy parts of the code just to make this more easy to follow, I know some of it doesnt need to be here. p  pContinuing, I was hoping that simply counting the number of good matches like this would be enough, but it turned out to mostly just point me to the image with the most descriptors. What I tried to after this was computing the homography. The aim was to compute it and see whether its a valid homoraphy or not. The hope was that a good match, and only a good match, would have a homography that is a good transformation. Creating the homography was done simply using emcvfindHomographyem on the emobjem and emsceneem which are emstdvectorlt cvPoint2fem. I checked the validity of the homography using some code I found online p  precodebool niceHomographycvMat H      stdcout ltlt H ltlt stdendl      const double det  H.atltdoublegt0, 0  H.atltdoublegt1, 1  H.atltdoublegt1, 0  H.atltdoublegt0, 1     if det lt 0              stdcout ltlt Homography bad determinant ltlt stdendl         return false           const double N1  sqrtH.atltdoublegt0, 0  H.atltdoublegt0, 0  H.atltdoublegt1, 0  H.atltdoublegt1, 0     if N1 gt 4  N1 lt 0.1              stdcout ltlt Homography bad first column ltlt stdendl         return false           const double N2  sqrtH.atltdoublegt0, 1  H.atltdoublegt0, 1  H.atltdoublegt1, 1  H.atltdoublegt1, 1     if N2 gt 4  N2 lt 0.1              stdcout ltlt Homography bad second column ltlt stdendl         return false           const double N3  sqrtH.atltdoublegt2, 0  H.atltdoublegt2, 0  H.atltdoublegt2, 1  H.atltdoublegt2, 1     if N3 gt 0.002              stdcout ltlt Homography bad third row ltlt stdendl         return false           return true  codepre  pI dont understand the math behind this so, while testing, I sometimes replaced this function with a simple check whether the determinant of the homography was positive. The problem is that I kept having issues here. The homographies were either all bad, or good when they shouldnt have been when I was checking only the determinant. p  pI figured I should actually use the homography and for a number of points just compute their position in the destination image using their position in the source image. Then I would compare these average distances, and I would ideally get a very obvious smaller average distance in the case of the correct image. This did not work strongat allstrong. All the distances were colossal. I thought I might have used the homography the other way around to calculate the right position, but switching emobjem and emsceneem with each other gave similar results. p  pOther things I tried were SURF descriptors instead of SIFT, BFMatcher brute force instead of FLANN, getting the emnem smallest distances for every image instead of a number depending on the minimum distance, or getting distances depending on a global maximum distance. None of these approaches gave me definite good results, and I feel stuck now. p  pMy only next strategy would be to sharpen the images or even turn them to binary images using some local threshold or some algorithms used for segmentation. I am looking for any suggestions or mistake anyone can see in my work. p  pI dont know whether this is relevant, but I added some of the images I am testing this on. Many times in the test images most of the SIFT vectors come from the frame higher contrast than the painting. This is why Im thinking sharpening the images might work, but I dont want to go deeper in case something I did previously is wrong. p  pThe gallery of images is a hrefhttpimgur.comaYBYFx0 relnofollowherea with the descriptions in the titles. The images are of quite high resolution, please view in case it might give some hints. p

What I want to do isp  precodewindow.document.getElementByIdmyframe.contentWindow.parent  window.document.getElementByIdmyframe.contentWindow.window codepre  pThe above works in Firefox, Chrome, Opera but not IE.p  pThe reason for doing this my iframe lets call it TOP itself has iframes in it lets call them SUBWINDOWS, and both of them have Javascript that calls parent.document.getElementById and such.  When you are in a top level window then parent.document.getElementId is the same as document.getElementById because for a top level window parent  window.  For the iframe SUBWINDOWS parent.document refers to the the document of the top level window.  Seems a bit sloppy, but it works, relying on the fact that parent  window for a top level window.p  pBut now that top level window TOP is now an iframe in a bigger page lets call it BIG.  The Javascript in TOP that does parent.document.getElementById is now referring to BIGs document, whereas before it was referring to TOPs document.p  pSo one quick and easy fix is to change the iframes parent to point to itself.

I was wondering where is a good place to put the twoway mapping Frontend vs Backendp  pIt feels easier to do it in the frontend as we can put tags to replace the content during the page rendering and when the data is being sent back, the backend data is intact and can be directly consumed by database. In the above example we are basically providing a drop down list for user to choose from. We want to add countries to the time zone offset while still keeping the original format in the database. p  pThanksp
Negative 991 pMatlabs syntax is infuriating, specifically with structs.

Negative 991 pThis took me ages to find out but cant seem to find a solution for this one. Using vagrant I run a Fedora 20 guest that runs gruntkarma. The sources I edit on my host but when I save grunt isnt detecting the change so no tests are being done.p  pFigured it was a configuration problem so tried many combinations of things here without success. Finally I opened a second ssh to the guest codevagrang sshcode and changed the file in the other ssh terminal codeecho   gtgt appjsapp.jscode and see that now gruntkarma detects the change and runs the tests again.p  pSince it has no x windows or anything Im running the tests with PhantomJS. Another problem was that I had to set codeEnableSendfile offcode in the httpd.conf to prevent Apache to send garbage when serving textfiles from the share thats my project in host and web root in guest. My guess is there may be another setting that needs being done to node so it detects the changes made by the host to the files on the share. Its using virtualBox share.p  pHas anyone experienced this before and is there a solution for this Seems that host machine changing files on the share doesnt trigger some event that gruntkarma is listening for to indicate the file has changed.p  pstrong[update]strongp  pTried NFS and rsync share but NFS didnt work at all and rsync seems to just sync on startup.p  pstrong[update]strongp  pAs a temporary solution I have to manually tell the file is updated in the ssh terminalp  precodestart grunt and give me back command grunt amp when I update a file tell grunt its updated touch d now testunitloginSpec.js codepre  pFunny that if I update codeappjslogin.jscode and tell grunt the codetestunitloginSpec.jscode is updated it will run the tests again but with the old login.js even though it has changed codecat appjslogin.jscode shows the changes. If not for this the solution would be set focus to right window and 2 keystroke arrow up and enterp

Ive run it in debug mode and there are no errors or stack traces reported by Cobertura. p  pMy configuration in the POM file is quite simplep  precodeltpropertiesgt     ltproject.build.sourceEncodinggtUTF8ltproject.build.sourceEncodinggt ltpropertiesgt ltdependenciesgt      ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.mavenltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmavenartifactltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt3.0.5ltversiongt     ltdependencygt      ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.mavenltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmavencompatltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt3.0.5ltversiongt     ltdependencygt      ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.mavenltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmavenpluginapiltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt3.0.5ltversiongt     ltdependencygt      ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmavenresourcespluginltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt2.6ltversiongt     ltdependencygt       ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.mavenltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmavencoreltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt3.0.5ltversiongt     ltdependencygt        ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.plugintoolsltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmavenpluginannotationsltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt3.1ltversiongt     ltdependencygt     ltdependencygt         lt version 2.1 uses sonatype aether. anything after 2.1 uses eclipse aether. gt         ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.plugintestingltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmavenplugintestingharnessltartifactIdgt         ltscopegttestltscopegt         ltversiongt2.1ltversiongt     ltdependencygt     ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtjunitltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtjunitltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt4.11ltversiongt         ltscopegttestltscopegt     ltdependencygt     ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.twdata.mavenltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmojoexecutormavenpluginltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt2.1.0ltversiongt     ltdependencygt     ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtmavenassemblypluginltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt2.4ltversiongt         lttypegtmavenpluginlttypegt     ltdependencygt ltdependenciesgt ltbuildgt     ltpluginsgt         ltplugingt             ltartifactIdgtmavensurefirepluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.16ltversiongt             ltexecutionsgt                 ltexecutiongt                     ltidgttestcustompluginltidgt                     ltphasegttestltphasegt                     ltgoalsgt                          ltgoalgttestltgoalgt                     ltgoalsgt                     ltconfigurationgt                         ltforkModegtneverltforkModegt                         ltforkCountgt0ltforkCountgt                         ltreuseForksgttrueltreuseForksgt                     ltconfigurationgt                 ltexecutiongt             ltexecutionsgt         ltplugingt          ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtmavencompilerpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt3.1ltversiongt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltsourcegt1.6ltsourcegt                 lttargetgt1.6lttargetgt             ltconfigurationgt         ltplugingt         ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtmavenpluginpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt3.2ltversiongt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltgoalPrefixgtMyCustomPluginltgoalPrefixgt             ltconfigurationgt             ltexecutionsgt                 ltexecutiongt                     ltidgtdefaultdescriptorltidgt                     ltgoalsgt                         ltgoalgtdescriptorltgoalgt                     ltgoalsgt                     ltphasegtprocessclassesltphasegt                 ltexecutiongt                 ltexecutiongt                     ltidgthelpdescriptorltidgt                     ltgoalsgt                         ltgoalgthelpmojoltgoalgt                     ltgoalsgt                     ltphasegtprocessclassesltphasegt                 ltexecutiongt             ltexecutionsgt         ltplugingt         ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.mojoltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtcoberturamavenpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.5.2ltversiongt         ltplugingt     ltpluginsgt ltbuildgt     codepre  pCobertura works on all of my other projects so far, is there any reason that it would failing to report coverage for a Maven plugin projectp

Negative 991 pIm using IntelliJ GUI Builder to design a GUI for my application.  In it, there is a codeJTablecode inside a codeJScrollPanecode that doesnt seem to be working.  Firstly, I cant get the column headers to display.  Second, table clicking is not working.  It acts as if Im clicking 3 rows down from where I actually am, both in default row selection and in any codeMouseListenerscode I implement.  Lastly, if the table exceeds the size of the codeJScrollPanecode, it just ignores the last X rows and doesnt provide a scroll bar to view them.  p  pIve reworked the project a couple times now, trying extensions of codeAbstractTableModelcode, then codeDefaultTableModelcode, and lately I have tried ditching a custom codeTableModelcode altogether and just using a codeDefaultTableModelcode constructor to no avail.  Here is all relevant code some of it is autogenerated by the GUI Builder and I cant modify it directly.  p  pcodeBaldGUI.javacode the main guip  precodepackage client  import client.DataTypes.Record

Negative 991 pAfter installing my VB6 application on a administrator account, I want to run it on a standard user account. Immediately after double clicking the shortcut Windows Installer starts up and it asks me to provide the path to the installation package. If I cancel this, I am presented with an error dialog that says strongWindows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.strong The error dialog contains the path to the installer in the titlebar of the dialog, the path in the titlebar points to the admin users desktop.p  pWhen I run the shortcut as Admin the application works fine and strongdoesntstrong launch Windows Installer. The application also works fine if I completely turn off UAC.p  pPlease note that the application is installed permachine and doesnt require admin privileges to run according to its manifest. The installer was created using Advanced Installer 11.1 Enterprise Edition.p  pI have added permissions to Everyone for all the registry keys in the registry tab of Advanced Installer. I do however have custom actions that register my COM dlls after the installation is done copying the files to the filesystem. It would be almost impossible to give these keys the same permissions because there are quite alot of keys being added when registered this way.p  pAm I correct in saying that Windows Installer is repairing my application so that the standard user can use it After I let the installer do its thing I must restart my pc, after the restart the application also works fine. p  pI have also tried to create a .sdb using Microsoft Compatibility Administrator to set the RunAsInvoker compatibility fix for the application, this also doesnt seem to have any effect whatsoever. Furthermore I also gave Everyone FullControl of all the folders and files that my application uses, this also doesnt do anything.p  pWhen I run ProcessMonitor, I dont see any AccessDenied errors. All the registry access though is set to DesiredAccessMaximum Allowed. Most registry access is also pointing to HKCU hive, this is expected however as most keys from my application reside there.p  pAm I missing something here, is there some permission that is being set that I am not aware of Is it possible that some registry value is being modified that requires admin privileges, and if so, is it possible to allow my application access to all the keys that are added by the installer Manually setting the permissions on each key is a pain because of the somewhat 100 keys that are added.p

Negative 991 pI followed a tutorial on angularJS with subviews using ngviewsp  pIm using html5Mode in my locationProvider and a nodejs backendp  pIf I wanted to link to or hit refresh while on a specific ngview, I could use a hashtag. So like, to explain if my angular app lived on localhost3000app and I had a view at localhost3000appsubview, if I hit refresh my node server didnt know how to go to a specific view on the front end.p  pBut if, on the server side, a request came through for appsubview and I redirected to or rendered appsubview with the hashtag in there, then I went to the correct ngview on the front end. Thats what I wanted. Of course, theres more than one way to skin a cat I guess, but it was working.p  pNow, Im trying to do that again. But this time its not working.p  pIf I try to go to localhost3000appsubview via a link or refresh, instead of going to the ngview that lives at appsubview like it did before, its going to app2Fsubview instead. And Im ..heh .. heh.. not sure whats different. I thought I was doing everything exactly the same.p  pHas anyone had this problem Does anyone know what is happeningp  pEdit I think I kind of found a workaround. If I set base href  app in the head of the html document, and then respond to a request to appsubview with a redirect to appsubview, then I can serve up app with the correct subview only the url goes to subview. I think this might be acceptable for me even if its not quite ideal but OH WELLp

Negative 991 pIn my app, I have a very custom codeUITableViewcode. The cells are all statically defined in Interface Builder, but based on the data structure the table morphs in many various ways. For example, if some data doesnt exist, some cells or entire sections are not displayed, custom separator lines are added to account for missing cells, extra views are loaded into the cells, VoiceOver labels change, etc. Because all the cells are static, I set up the table layout in codeviewDidLoadcode because I always have the data available at that time. I have always presented this view controller modally, which has worked great. If the user wants to display different data in this table they have to dismiss the view controller and pick a different item to present it again, and it gets rendered appropriately in all cases. p  pBut now I am converting this into a split view controller for iPad, so this codeUITableViewControllercode never disappears off screen, but I need to set up the table again when the user taps an item. The problem is, because the table is never deallocated, its previous layout still exists when I load more data into it. It would be a lot of work and an excellent opportunity for many difficult to reproduce bugs to pop up to test all possible scenarios and try to reset it back to its pre viewDidLoad state or undo those previous layout changes if not relevant anymore, if not impossible because I dont have references to the many different custom separator lines generated.p  pMy question is, strongis it possible to completely reset the table view controllerstrong every time a row is selected in the master view controller, therefore allowing it to properly set up the layout because it is not stuck with the previous layoutp  pI essentially need some way to completely wipe it clean as if it never did any setup, then instantiate it again to cause codeviewDidLoadcode get called or I can move that code to its own method or codeviewWillAppearcode. Im basically looking for a way to reset the codetableViewcode back to how it is defined in Interface Builder.p  pI believe this would result in a flash because the table would completely disappear then reappear in a different format, but that would be acceptable. If that can be animated thatd be nice. If this is emreallyem not recommended at all, how do you suggest I proceed to ensure the layout is always appropriate for the data it is presentingp

The Information will be updated dailyp  pOther Info The data set is relatively big 100k records and whilst I have had no problems with other tables, the image table doesnt have a Primary key. This slows down any querys tremendously. How can I resolve this issue with the best speed possible do I add an incremental primary key Will this even helpp  pIm thinking that I will need a sql where statement to get the mainimage and then iterate over an array to build up altimg1, altimg2 etc. but I really am unsure as to how to proceed with the best solution.p  pCurrently I have been using php and I am hoping to automate all of this by cron once all is said and done. Any suggestions on how I should proceed would be greatly appreciated and any pitfalls you experts could see me having would also be helpful.  Thanks.

Negative 991 pI have an application where I need to find the position of peaks in a given set of data. The resolution must be much higher than the spacing between the datapoints i.e. it is not sufficient to find the highest datapoint, instead a virtual peak position has to be estimated given the shape of the peak. A peak is made of about 4 or 5 datapoints. A dataset is acquired every few ms and the peak detection has to be performed in real time.p  pI compared several methods in LabVIEW and I found the best result in terms of resolution and speed is given by the LabVIEW PeakDetector.vi, which scans the dataset with a moving window  3 points width and for each position performs a quadratic fit. The resulting quadratic function a parabola has a local maximum, which is in turn compared to nearby points.p  pNow I want to implement the same method in C.

Only the noise is much worse than the LabVIEW counterpart i.e. I get a very oscillating peak position, given the same input dataset and the same parameters. As the algorithm works the above code should be conceptually correct, so I think it might be a numerical problem as I simply use floats without further effort to improve numerical accuracy. Is this a possible answer Does anyone have a tip, where I should be looking top  pThanks.p  pPS I have done my search and found this very a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions382186fittingpolynomialstodatagood overviewa and also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5303239csharpfindingpeakswithinagivenwidthviaquadraticfitthis questiona, similar to mine unfortunately with not many answers. I will study these further.p  pEDIT I have found my problems being elsewhere. Improving the algorithm by removing certain output values a sort of postvalidation in which a result is only accepted if the result is within the moving window brought the solution to the issue. Now I am satisfied with the results, i.e. they are comparable to those from LabVIEW. Nevertheless, thanks a lot for your comments.p

So, instead of this error message, I should redirect them if they try to access this function in the same profile php file without being affected by the main check if logged in or not. How I can do this to exclude a function from getting affected by this BTW As stated all functions are in the same php script file.p

Alternatively, if you are using .NET 4.0 or higher you can install the MvcSiteMapProvider.MVCx NuGet package corresponding to your MVC version.  If the setting is set to true, you must set the SiteMaps.Loader property during ApplicationStart in Global.asax to an instance of the builtin SiteMapLoader type or a custom ISiteMapLoader instance.

Negative 991 pFor the sake of localization, I want to create a custom a hrefhttpsfluentvalidation.codeplex.com relnofollowfluentvalidationa rule that retrieves regex strings and error messages from a resource file embased on conventionem.  This is similar to having a hrefhttphaacked.comarchive20110714modelmetadataandvalidationlocalizationusingconventions.aspx relnofollowconventionbased localizeable dataannotationsa.p  pI think I can make this work so that I can retrieve the regex strings, but I dont know how to retrieve the error message according to the same standard.  Below is the code I started writing which demonstrates the problem.p  pThe a hrefhttpsfluentvalidation.codeplex.comwikipagetitleCustomampreferringTitleDocumentationampANCHORCustomValidator relnofollowdocumentationa helped me to create the following custom codePropertyValidatorcodep  precodepublic class RegexValidator  PropertyValidator      public RegexValidator          baseWHOOPS, NO GOOD      protected override bool IsValidPropertyValidatorContext context              This is the conventionbased aspect.  The resource key is derived         from the model and property names.         var key  String.Format0.1.Regex, context.Instance.GetType.Name, context.PropertyName         custom extension method to fetch resource string...         string regexValidationString  ResourceManager.GetObjectkey         var reg  new RegexregexValidationString         return reg.IsMatchcontext.PropertyValue as string       codepre  pThe above code is a little rough around the edges for two reasons.  First, I had to supply a value to the base constructor which is incorrect for my needs.  Second, I had to use reflection to obtain the name of the model with codecontext.Instance.GetTypecode.  The name should be available as metadata.p  pHowever, so far so good.  At least the code works.  So now it is time for the custom error message.  Ill try to encapsulate the emconvention basedem custom validator and error message in a single extension method.p  precodepublic static class BrandedValidation      public static IRuleBuilderOptionsltT, TElementgt MatchesltT, TElementgtthis IRuleBuilderltT, TElementgt ruleBuilder              return ruleBuilder             .SetValidatornew RegexValidator             .WithLocalizedMessage       codepre  pSuddenly this is not working.  No overload of codeWithLocalizedMessagecode or codeWithMessagecode provides access to the metadata that was previously available in the codePropertyValidatorcontextcode.p  pIf only the codeIRuleBuilderltT,TPropertygtcode had getterproperties that provided the metadata.p  pDoes somebody know another way to achieve my goal p

So I added this to both the codeUsercode and codeGuestcode modelsp  precodeprotected with  [detail] codepre  pThis means that whenever the codecustomercode polymorphic relation is eager loaded, then both codeUsercode and codeGuestcode will load their relationships automatically.

Negative 991 pI compute a hash using eminitupdatefinalem mechanism i.e. initialize the hash context, followed by hash update with various sizes of input data, and a final digest calculation. This can be done using a hrefhttpswww.openssl.orgdocscryptoEVPMDCTXmd.html relnofollowthe EVPDigestInit, EVPDigestUpdate and EVPDigestFinalEx functions of OpenSSLa or the a hrefhttpwww.cryptopp.comdocsrefclasssha512.html relnofollowUpdate and Final methods of Cryptoa.p  pFrom what I can dig up from the source code of emOpenSSLem and emCryptoem, it seems like the input data actually get copied and stored. Can anyone confirm this Is this a limitation of the hashing process or is it a standard procedure And does this vary with the digest algorithm usedp  pI was under the impression that the hashing algorithm would compute some internal state based on the chunk of input data, and the final digest will be computed based on the internal states collected over all the various update calls. This does not seem to be the case. Obviously I do not understand the mechanics of hashing algorithms enough. p

Negative 991 pI have got an application which worked fine when saving just as a .doc file. I have since tried to get it so the program will save as both .doc and .pdf, this is done using the WordXP unit.p  precodeprocedure TDocCreator.CloseDocumentASaveAs  string var   LFileName  OleVariant begin   LFileName  ASaveAs   FDoc.SaveAsLFileName, EmptyParam,EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam,      EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam   LFileName  ChangeFileExtASaveAs, .pdf   FDoc.SaveAsLFileName,PDFFileFormat,EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam,      EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam, EmptyParam   FWordApp.NormalTemplate.Saved  true   FWordApp.QuitTrue   FWordApp.Disconnect end  codepre  pIf I delete the second saveas the code works fine. The EOleException Command Failed exception is not popping up every time a document is saved but the point in which the break occurs is when the SaveAs is for the .pdf file. p  pNote I only have 2 saving procedures available SaveAsUsed above and SaveAs2000. Also I am away from a machine which can compile delphi.p  pIf I have missed anything or need to clear anything up I will be able to respond, however I will not be able to test any code changes till Tuesday.p  pThank you.p  pEdit Okay the program is being remote debugged  The machine which does all the code does not have access to office as it is on a VM. The application goes through a set of templates which get mailmerged, once done the saving process begins. So I did 2 documents This process is done in a for loop. This worked fine. I then tried to do 5 on the third file it brought up the Command Failed error. Which then doesnt close word and cancels the remaining process. When  looking at LFileName its contents were . This is sometimes foreign characters. Though it still manages to make the .doc file with the correct filenam. This filename is set up outside the procedure if that makes any difference ASaveAs. Another thing is that the file is not being opened using any other applications. It does the whole process using the word application the program opens.p

Negative 991 pI have a few questions about buffering and how to manage it. At this moment I have a roku channel that streams both, mkv and mp4 files, as well as hls live streams.p  pWhen I test the channel with 50 Mbps it works well, but with slower internet connections 5  12 Mbps it buffers a lot and I didnt find any information on how to manage this.p  pFor the live stream Im using a custom player using the roVideoPlayer, feeding it with and a list of live stream links. Apperently when it loses connection it skips to the next item on the list, and what I want to do is to rebuffer the current channel even if the connection is slow.p  pNow for the mkv and mp4 Im using the roVideoScreen, the problem is that with HD content more than 420 it buffers a alot, and I would like to buffer only once even if it takes longer.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

Negative 991 pMy group uses an Excel macrobased tool to do some serious number crunching. I would like to move the numbercrunching bit to SQL because using VBA has become intolerable due to the runtime. Users need to be able to use Excel as the interface and also need to be able to run their macros simultaneously as the Excel workbook is selfcontained. Ive been testing my plan to call an SQL stored procedure from VBA to pull the data from Excel into SQL temp tables, crunch it, and send it back to Excel. Im able to pull the data from Excel if I run my SP in SQL Management Studio. Here is the SPp  precodeALTER PROCEDURE sptestimport  Add the parameters for the stored procedure here path varchar1000 AS BEGIN SET NOCOUNT ON  declare  SQL varchar2500 set SQL   select  from openrowsetMicrosoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0,   Excel 12.0 Macro    Databasepath,    [Sheet1]   create table [test]     col1 varchar15,     col2 varchar15,     col3 varchar15,     col4 varchar15   insert into test execSQL  select  from mbtest END codepre  pSo that works fine. I then try to call this SP from the Excel file containing the data.p  precodeOption Explicit  Sub adotest  Dim adoConnection As ADODB.Connection Dim adoRecordset As ADODB.Recordset Dim connectString As String Dim strSQL As String Dim sPath As String  WorksheetsSheet1.Select sPath  ThisWorkbook.FullName  Create a new ADO connection  Set adoConnection  New ADODB.Connection Create a new ADO recordset  Set adoRecordset  New ADODB.Recordset  Build our connection string to use when we open the connection   connectString  DRIVERSQL ServerSERVERMyServerTrustedConnectionyesDATABASEtestDB adoConnection.ConnectionTimeout  20 adoConnection.CommandTimeout  20  adoConnection.Open connectString strSQL  EXEC testDB.dbo.sptestimport  amp vbCr              amp path   amp  amp sPath amp   adoRecordset.Open strSQL, adoConnection  End Sub codepre  pThe code hangs on the adoRecordset.Open call. If I instead pass a path to a separate Excel file in the variable path, then everything works swimmingly. Is there a simple way that I can make this SP call from the same workbook Im not worried about security since the SQL db will be a dedicated structure for pulling in and processing temporary data. I just need users to be able to run their Excel tools whenever they want to, so I dont want to use permanent tables in the DB in case their respective inputs get mixed up together.p  pEverything Ive found online deals with ASP or ISS and I know nothing about ASP and ISS doesnt seem like the right solution to my particular problem. I could have VBA pass the data to external text files and then pass the paths to those text files to the SQL SP, but if there is a cleaner solution then I would like to know about it. Thanks in advancep

Negative 991 pIm looking for the best way to implement a checkall input for multiple rows of input.p  pIn this case, since there are several types of list views, each one has its own Directive and Controller.p  pI was thinking to implement the checkall control as an Attribute Directive, inside the parent Directives template, something likep  precodeltinput checkallnameOfParentDirectivegt codepre  pThe idea is to pass along the name of the parent Directive as the value of the custom attribute, so this instance of the Check All Directive knows which parent scope to use, to thus check, or uncheck all of the rows in the respective table.p  pHeres where I got hung up, I wasnt sure how to dynamically set a require value.  Setting it statically is easyp  precoderequire parentDirective, codepre  pBut that wont work here.p  pPerhaps Im overcomplicating things, Im guessing there is an easier way to do this.p  pThe end result is to bubble up the checkuncheck change event on the input to the parent Directive, so all of its checkboxes can be either checked or unchecked accordingly...p  pCheersp

Negative 991 pI am using the codeimgTagcode to display SVG images which my users uplaoded to my Amazon S3 bucket. p  precodeltimg srchttptestbucket.s3.amazonaws.commysvg.svg gt codepre  pThe problem is that, once the image is loaded and shown, its not the size it was constructed for.

In this case code128x128pxcode.p  pThe only idea I came up with is downloading the image with an ajax request and parse the codeViewBoxcode attribute out of the svg source. Than I adjust the size. However, I do not want to make any unnecessary http requests and I am looking for a solution to read the images codeViewBoxcode dimensions. I could use the codeltobjectgtTagcode to load the image but since its hosted on Amazon I get a cross domain issue and cannot read the svgs source. Even when adding codeCORScode rules to my bucket.p  pIdeasp

Negative 991 pI am writing a piece of code in SMLNJ and need, at some point, to access a list, which I have already created. I know that, in C, for example, accessing an array takes constant time. So, I thought that that would be the case for ML as well. Apparently, however, the builtin List.nthl,i function has a complexity that is linear to the size of the list given as argument. p  pI then turned to arrays, but I think that the Array.sub function has, also, linear complexity.p  pSo, given the fact the accesing a tuple, like 212,5.6,foo, has an O1 complexity, I would like to ask whether there is a way, I could use a tuple, instead of a list,but access it dynamically.p  pFor example, say I want to write a function that takes a tuple, with only boolean values, and an integer n, and returns True if the nth element of the tuple is true.Something likep  precodefun isTrue n,tup  if ntup then true else false codepre  pI know this isnt valid SML, so is there a way to write such a functionp  pThanks a lot in advance for your timep
Negative 991 pIm evaluating a Percona xtradb 5.6 cluster of 3 nodes in AWS environment. Im using codeec2consistentsnapshotcode with codemysqlcode to make an EBS snapshot of the data. However when a snapshot was made on codenode 1code, and then codenode 2code is relaunched using that snapshot, the cluster would break.p  pThrough trialanderror Ive found that this is caused by reusing codeauto.cnfcode and codegvwstate.datcode files in mysql datadir, which would contain ids of codenode 1code, and the issues were apparently caused by another node trying to join with id of another node already in cluster. Removing the said files appears to have fixed the issue and now nodes go up and down as expected.p  pMy question is did I do the right thing Do I need to remove auto.cnf and gvwstate.dat before using another servers datadir Do I need to do anything else Whats the standard practice for this sort of thing p

Negative 991 pI have 5 Mongod members, each on geographically separated VPSs. Each member is 3.03 and running on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit fully updated.p  pWhen I initiated the replica set on one of the VPS, the one I wanted to be the initial primary member, I had 1 of the 4 members misconfigured. It was not running with the replica set name specified. So of course, this caused an intiate error. 1 Mongod I was initiatingon became Primary, 3 of the other members became Secondarys, but that 1 member never initiated and joined. It stays stuck in status Startup forever, never joins the replica set.p  pI have tried everything I can think of to correct and clear this error and nothing is working. Removing the log and data files to reset it didnt work. I went so far as to completely uninstallreinstall MongoDb on that 1 erroring VPS. On each attempted fix, Im trying to rs.add it again on the Primary. Of course I did rs.remove.... on the Primary to remove it before trying rs.add. Doesnt matter. It never adds to the set. There is something stuck some where on the primary that is preventing me from readding this VPS to the set.p  pDoes anyone know of anyway to make this happen Is there something I need to do on the Primary to eliminate any lingering info from this failed initiatep  pI really dont want to dump everything and start over. It is working fine with the members it has, but its an even number so I have to either drop 1 member or get this 5th to join the set. The latter is my hope.p  pThank you very much for any thoughts and advice.p
Negative 991 pI am just learning about WebPack module, and I am thinking of moving the entire JS infrastructure of my Django app to modules. It seems that a straightforward way of doing this is to create a webpack module for each Django template or view, and have a single codeltscriptgtcode tag on each page.p  pHowever, Im trying to find a way of passing the content of Django template variables to these webpack modules. Previously I could have these variables inlinedp  precodeltscriptgt Sample code.. var arr  []  for s in vars  arr.pushs  endfor  ltscriptgt codepre  pNow, I only havep  precodeltscript srctemp.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pOne potential solution I found is to define the webpack module to be a library that exports a single root function to the global namespace in the browser. Then use an inline codescriptcode tag to put the Django variables into a JS variable, and pass this as arguments to the exported function.p  pThis somehow feels like a clumsy way of doing things. Any ideas as to how I can handle this betterp  pThanksp

Thus a request via telnet to my server returns just that.  p  pHowever, when the identical request is sent via a browser, codeGET cat.html HTTP1.1code is converted by the browser and sent as codeGET cat22.html HTTP1.1code.  Thus, em400em is not being returned but rather em404  Not Foundem since the file codecat22.htmlcode is not in my public directory.  p  pIm confused as to what the RFC is wanting since it would never be possible to send codeGET cat.html HTTP1.1code via a browser and have a error code of 404 returned.  Since codecat.htmlcode is a bad request sent via a browser a server should return that but its not possible unless you code in the server code22code as being a bad request however anything with code22code in the filename is valid and thus wouldnt be a em400 bad requestem although it could be em404 Not Foundem.  p  pWhat am I missing herep

I also tried switching the Policy GUID to WINTRUSTACTIONGENERICVERIFYV2, which returned error TRUSTESUBJECTFORMUNKNOWN.  Neither error code is particularly illuminating about what the ultimate issue is.p  pEDIT 2 I also ran Microsofts SignTool.exe on the dll in question, and got the following outputp  precodeSignTool Error A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root         certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.

Negative 991 pDoes anyone know if it is possible to save the column sorting and sizes in Reference Manager in VS2012p  pOne thing I really hate about Reference Manager in VS2008VS2012  is how it totally ignores any column sorting or resizing that I make, from session to session. This is particularly annoying of when I have a large solution with many projects, all with similar names. Having to resizesort the columns every time I want to add a reference is painful. Is there some way to set these changes permanentlyp

Negative 991 pOk so I have a view that takes approximately 3 seconds to execute, and using some sample data it manages to return a total of 11 rows.p  pThen I make a query that calls the view, such as the following onep  precodeSELECT SUMCOL1, SUMCOL2, SUMCOL3 FROM SELECT CLIENT,         SUMDECODECOL1,ABC,1,0,          SUMDECODECOL2,DEF,1,0,         SUMDECODECOL3,ABC,1,0,  FROM MyView  WHERE INDICATOR IN GREEN,YELLOW  GROUP BY CLIENT, TYPE  UNION ALL  SELECT TOTAL TOTAL,         SUMDECODECOL1,ABC,1,0,          SUMDECODECOL2,DEF,1,0,         SUMDECODECOL3,ABC,1,0,  FROM MyView  WHERE INDICATOR IN GREEN,YELLOW  GROUP BY TYPE    WHERE TYPE  TYPE A  GROUP BY CLIENT codepre  pIn this manner it manages to return rows grouped by client on top and on the bottom it shows the total of all the sums of all clients.p  pHowever when I run the entire query, it takes over 1 minute to execute, with only 11 rows to manage from the view.p  pIf I run each part of the union indepedently they each take about 11 seconds and if I run them together they take about 23 seconds.p  pBut with the outter most query it takes over a minutep  pAm I missing something about how views work I noticed that if I took out the where clauses from the entire query it takes only 12 seconds to run the entire query.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 991 pCurrently, I am trying to run a simple Magick program that opens an image file as per a tutorials instructionsp  precodeinclude ltMagick.hgt  include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  using namespace Magick  int mainint argc, char argv      InitializeMagickargv    Image imagechitanda.jpg    return 0   codepre  pHowever, upon trying to execute it I receive the following errorp  precodeCaught Magick exception testMagick must specify image size test.bmp  errorraw.cReadRAWImage136 codepre  pI figured that this meant that I needed to specify the size of the image I am reading. I have tried that, and still got an error, then I decided to make an odd attempt, what if I tried to execute a useless program such asp  precodeinclude ltMagick.hgt  include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  using namespace Magick  int mainint argc,char argv      return 0   codepre  pOddly enough, I get the same exact error message. What could be the cause I have only recently began dabbling in C, and I am even newer to Magick. Ive trawled the internet for an answer, but havent found anything. I hope that someone here has an ideap  pUPDATE 1 I should add that test.bmp is not a file or name I have heard, seen or touched every before. This is one of the reasons this is so confusing to me.p  pUPDATE 2 After going to bed upon giving up for the night, and trying again in the morning I was able to compile, and then execute the program without any errors. However, now the program doesnt do anything Ill execute it with .testMagick.cpp and even when I want it to do something visible, like print out a debug statement to the console  I get nothing. If anything, without the error I am now even more confused.p

Negative 991 pI have a small web panel on which I would like to control a python script that continuously collects data from a sensor while loop. I would like to be able to start and stop this script by simply clicking a button. I know of a method of enabling the script to stop, but starting it seems to be a bit of a hassle.p  pI have tried several solutions that included jQuery.ajax requests, but that sadly did not start the script. What should be noted is that I only want to start the script, I do not want any outputreturn values from it, so the script needs to run asynchronously in the background which is what Ajax is for after all.p  pHere are a few solutions that could potentially work 1 Install Flask. The thing is I actually really want to avoid that and instead find a direct way to do this. After all, I just want to make a request to the script so it gets executed. 2 Execute it by installing PHP on the server and use exec. But this again goes back to the point that I actually prefer to use Python directly or do it through a jQueryAjax call that actually works.p  pAny suggestions on how to set this up If there is really no other way, I suppose that installing PHP and using it to execute the files is the only way. If that is true, is it actually possible to have both Python scripts run asynchronously through the PHP exec callp

Do you think so as well plmtest does not warn you about that. For unbalanced panels, we need another version of the BreuschPagan test for random effects as is given by BaltagiLi 1990 A lagrange multiplier test for the error components model with incomplete panels, Econometric Reviews, 91, 103107, DOI 10.108007474939008800180.

That is until now, when for the first time I attempted to make it work targeting 64bit code.p  pI try stepping through the code line by line... first of all I execute the line codesomethingdone  TRUEcode which obviously sets somethingdone to 1... which I monitor in the watch window. Then I execute codeGetMessage ampmsg, NULL, 0, 0code ... but somehow during its execution, the variable codesomethingdonecode gets set to zero Subsequently the code then breaks out of the loop and , upon returning from the function call the compiler reports RunTime Check Failure 2  Stack around the variable msg was corrupted.p  pIm not sure where to go from here.p  precodevoid processmessagesuntilidle      MSG msg     int somethingdone     int temp      for               somethingdone  FALSE          temp  PeekMessageampmsg,NULL,0,0,PMNOREMOVE          if temp                      somethingdone  TRUE             GetMessage ampmsg, NULL, 0, 0             TranslateMessage ampmsg             DispatchMessage ampmsg                   if somethingdone                      break                codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong I changed somethingdone into a codestaticcode and now the program crashes somewhere else entirely  in a place that make more sense, so this will probably be easier to debug.p

Negative 991 pIm writing an application where it is important to be able to find out in real time whether a specific user identified by a socket id is currently connected to any machine inside the cluster or not... p  pHowever, this does not seem possible in the general case an easy implementation would only work unreliably. p  pFor example, lets say a two users are connected to two different servers A and B and chatting with one another using socket.io redis adapter, and suddenly server A goes down. Further, for whatever reason, the user connected to server A fails to reconnect to server B. Server B has no easy way to tell that server A has gone down and that its users have been disconnected. The user connected to server B therefore will not know that his partner cannot get his messages.p  pIs there any strategy to help in this case Maybe have the servers poll each other every few seconds to make sure they are alive Implement some kind of heartbeat function to make sure users are alive which would not be easy to implement at all in the general case Any clues as to how to proceed Thanksp
